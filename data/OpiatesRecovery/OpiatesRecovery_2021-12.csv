I got clean for two weeks, I was over the physical withdrawal but mentally I was like slow in my thinking and processing things.

I’d also have to make myself get up and do simple tasks like lifting my legs over the dog gate because my mind would tell me I’m too weak to do it but when I made myself do it my body didn’t hurt. Idk if I’m making any sense but it caused me to relapse. I want to get off them again, I’m not doing nearly as much as I used to but I can tell that I will get deeper in if I don’t stop sooner rather than later. 

I just need to know if this has happened with anyone else and if so how long did it take for you to be able to think straight and feel “happy”?? Is there anything that helped speed the process along?? 

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated. I want to be happy and sober but I’m struggling. Thanks in advance!!",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47934765}"

I have been in suboxone treatment (16mg/day) for a few months and it’s a life saver. But the constipation has become worse and worse until today I found myself needing the “Use of manual measures to help move or remove the stools from the rectum” (a quote from an article on the subject). I have had hemorrhoids for weeks due to this, but I have never had to do this.

After what happened today, I am sitting on an ice pack, lost a lot of blood, actually passed out, and ruined all our bath mats. It was a murder scene.

Anyway the advice on this is all over the place, there are a lot of options, and I can’t see my doc for another week - I can’t let this happen again and need OTC options.

Can anyone recommend a protocol for managing constipation, that has worked for them? Tbh I think I might just fast until my next appointment. I am a large guy, 6’2 300.

Edit: I’m already taking smooth moves tea every night after dinner, have psyllium packets twice a day, and take a stool softener pill every night before bed. I drink a lot of water and protein shakes. I eat fruit every day. I use a suppository for hemorrhoids nightly.

I took Vicodin pretty much everyday since May. Started off for pain but loved it too much. Decided to finally stop . At the worst I was taking about 6-7 10mg pills. I stopped cold turkey and had withdrawals so bad I thought I would have a seizure.

So i had a new plan I got back on and slowly weened off until I was only on 1 pill 5mg then stopped competely and that helped tremendously. I relapsed a few times after a few days and then now I’m on day 13 longest streak so far. The first 10 days were feeling like shit. Also got a new job during withdrawal lol so that was def a challenge.

Not going to lie though I kind of want to relapse but I know I shouldn’t. It’s just i’m going through so much right now. Dealing with a sick family member and honestly I got triggered yesterday because I started having this crush on this girl coworker who would always talk with me and flirt with me, we would talk all shift and then BAM guess what… new guy coworker and now shes all on him. I caught feelings for her smh. And we all work in the same section. So now I feel like im third wheeling it. Kind of sucks because I enjoyed being at work but now it’s frustrating.  But nonetheless I still am going to try and remain sober. I’m still going to the gym, still handling responsibility still keeping a positive attitude at work. But damn it’s tempting to relapse. I guess i have to take it day by day.

keeping my head on straight while adjusting my entire lifestyle definitely wasn’t easy, but it was so fucking worth it. i look back on where i was 6.5 months ago and it almost seems unbelievable. back then i felt completely trapped by this addiction and had serious doubts if i would ever be able to get to the point i’m at now.

i never did any group meetings or traditional counseling and could only talk to a couple people in my personal life about this, but honestly interacting with all of you on this sub was that therapy i needed.

it seriously helped to be on this forum with thousands of others going through, or having been through, the same exact shit i was dealing with. just knowing first hand that i wasn’t alone in this gave me real strength and courage to fight through it and be better. i don’t know a single one of your real names, but i have made true friends from this sub and i genuinely care about all you trying your best to improve your life and that of others.

My DoC may be a little easier to find than yours, but I feel we're kindred spirits.  Have any of you taken oral naltrexone and just felt utterly depressed even after cessation?  I posted this over on /r/Alcoholism_Medication but they had few takers and were incredulous of my experience.  I feel like my opioid receptors are just turned off.  That pleasurable tingle of the first drink of the day in the back of the head has been replaced with a stinging pain when trying to activate it.  I took it for two months, and now I'm about a month and a half off but I'm still experiencing this sensation which has honestly made me very depressed and it seems that my pain tolerance is quite low unless I have a few drinks in me.

The video above is a great resource in general, but I noticed one takeaway from Dr. Robert Booher.  He said that in long term alcoholics, we can develop a trait where we synthesize a chemical called THP that is analogous to morphine.  I have no medical experience and only base this on my personal feelings and experience, but I'm wondering if this is the mechanism in which The Sinclair Method works.  I seem to not have as much pleasure from drinking and the aforementioned stinging pain but I still press on because, well, it's a habit.

I would like to hear from others in similar situation to fully understand how much I fucked myself over and what kind of a withdrawal I'm in for.

Been taking 12 Nurofen + in the morning and afternoon every day for the last 6 months. That's 144mg of codeine and 2400mg of ibuprofen twice a day (288mg codeine and 4800mg ibuprofen daily), every day for 6 whole months. 

I have taken my last 12 Nurofen + dose this morning. 

I don't have to work until Tuesday.

How much of a ride am I in for? Will the physical withdrawal go away by Tuesday?

Any advice is very much appreciated. 

I am ashamed of my short-sightedness,  lack of self control and so scared of the damage I have done to my stomach and intestines by taking so much ibuprofen each day.

I'm so sick of living dose to dose and planning each waking hour around being near a pharmacy so I can get more poison. Putting life on the long finger just so I can get high and escape my situation. Stocking up on extra Nurofen boxes before the weekend to accommodate pharmacies being closed on Sundays. Changing the clothes and facemasks I wear to avoid pharmacy techs recognising me. Rotating the pharmacies I go to and times I go at to avoid being recognised for always buying the same thing over and over again.

Hey guys, I like to try and post this every once in a while. And this question is obviously not for those who do not have the resources. We all need some tough love sometimes, so what a better time than the holiday season to give some of you lovely people who are still struggling something to think about. And this, inherently, is going to fill some of you with rage because looking in the mirror can sometimes be painful. So I’ll just say it. 

“$100k for the cars, half a mill for the addiction. They shipped me off to rehab because I started questioning my existence. Give me the prescriptions and I’ll show you repetition, stubborn motherfucker you know Ruby never listens…”

Why are you still refusing to go to rehab? What lie did you tell yourself today? 

Oh, you’re gonna do it on your own? How has that worked out for you so far? Oh, but a guy on reddit told you you won’t be dopesick if you just drink 5000 milligram of vitamin C six times a day? Ah, foolproof. You’ve sure outsmarted addiction this time. Just be sure to eat a whole pack of Immodium with it too, just like that one guy told you before.

Your parents/friends/coworkers/peers will judge you? I’m sure they’re saving their judgements for now. They weren’t judging you when you nodded off at the dinner table, nor were they judging when you when they heard you sniffling coming out of the office bathroom for the 9th time before 10am. They’re gonna think you’re a no good fucking junkie now that you’re finally giving sobriety an honest shot. (The sarcasm is strong with this one.) 

It doesn’t work? It sure doesn’t, until you talk to someone it did for. But even then, it wasn’t the rehab that did it was it? You didn’t really buy into that culty shit did you? Heard the food sucks. Oh well it only works for like, 1% of people anyway. They must have got real lucky. Good for them though.

I could keep going on and on about all these super legit and valid excuses to not give treatment a shot, but I digress. Fortunately none of you knew me during active addiction. You would have seen me screaming in my mothers face about how rehab doesn’t work; at my mothers celebration of four years sober after she went to rehab. Truly a sight to behold.

Happy Holidays folks. I truly wish all of you the best this new year. And I’ll part with a useful piece of information. At the treatment facility I went to, if you could simply pay the deductible and get in, the facility would NEVER send your remaining bill to collections. Do what you will with that information.

Firstly let me start of saying. I totally respect anyone that struggles on a stronger opiate that codeine. Oxy, Tramadol, etc. 

I find even the most subtle / yet addicting drug - Codeine has ruled my life the past 5 years and quitting has failed me. Time after time. 

I’m from UK and I find my secret addiction so difficult to seek help. Even asking for support from GP placed me in a position to attending a meeting and feeling like I didn’t “belong” amongst other users. It also placed me at risk of “safeguarding” me against my career / job due to this addiction. I felt being honest had more damaging effects to my life, family, careers rather than support. 

I swiftly left and didn’t return. 

I find my addiction allows me to function daily. If I go cod turkey or reduce my dosage - my mood dramatically hits a low. I really struggle. Even tapering my dosage.

Along with this addiction also causes more severe health issues. Due to codeine being available OTC in the UK I have to get my hit along with unwanted other pharmaceutical drugs. Paracetomol/ ibuprofen. 

I have GABA on hand abs readily available which I find helps with the restlessness. But the one symptom that always drags me back is the drop in my mental health. I hit rock bottom. I being an emotional wreck and feel any outlook becomes hazy and grim. 

I feel I’m stuck lately guys. My mind and willpower always wants me to end this habit. I just feel getting through it absolute torture. 

Any advice? Tips? Experience?

So for a lot of my teens until I was 20, I was a major poly-addict, mostly iv herion and crack. I was sent to TC as an alternative for jail by my probation officer. My mom agreed, but they both knew nothing about the program. Everyone was just desperate for me to get help, rightfully so. I am also extremely non-religious, but I hadn't been to jail before so I agreed to go.

I ran out quite a while before I left, so I was in almost full DT when I arrived, Late at night I went down to the desk to get Advil or anything to help the symptoms. Ive been to rehab before at this point, so I figured there would be at least one medical professional there, NOPE. This punk ass told me to go pray about it..... tf?

The very next day we were to clean the Covelli center after a Disney on ice show. I ran those streets a lot and knew that area very well. with all my clothes and paperwork and everything still in my room at tc, I fuckin dipped. I didn't care about anything but getting far away from those people. I didn't run for very long cuz they didn't notice me leave, but I was not about to go thru 12 months of that.

Fast forward to a couple days later, I have to go tell the judge why I left. I was sentenced to 30 days in county jail and finished probation. I feel like I dodged a bullet with some of the horror stories I hear. I was like 'Thats all jail is?' County was cake all we did was sleep and drink coffee. 30 days of that or 12 months of fuckin god this and Jesus that, ill take jail every time.

Should I get on subs?,"Do other people suffer depression and complete hopelessness and loss of motivation for an extended period post physical wds? How long does it last?

This shit I am going through now is in a way even darker than the misery of active addiction. 

I kicked heroin once before for 2 years and relapsed 4 months ago. I keep quitting but can’t STAY quit. I go through the bad physical withdrawals and get to around day 10-14 when the hard part is over. But for me that’s when the worst part takes over—the depression, fear, loneliness, not feeling like myself and I just want to cry and isolate and disappear. This is what eventually breaks me down to the point that I use again. And like magic, I feel okay once more, almost instantly. It’s like I don’t even care about getting high (I mean, I’m an addict so obv I do…but) but it’s more just that I desperately want to escape from the depression that has me questioning my own existence and I just want to FEEL NORMAL!!!!!

When I got clean a few years ago it seemed like I was battling this same depression forever. It must have been 6 months before I felt emotionally stable(ish). I honestly don’t think I have that fight in me this time after this last run. I’m broken and I can’t live like this. I know using fent everyday is also not sustainable and I’m gonna die if I keep on.
………So I am strongly considering sub maintenance. I’ve had doctors and friends beg me to get on subs in the past because they thought that was my best shot at staying alive. But I was never game bc I fear that once I’m on them and with the ease of acquiring them legally and affordably, what would be my motivation to ever stop them? I don’t want to be dependent on opioids forever. 

Last week I visited a friend who has been hooked on subs for years (without a script) and she hated to see me in such a dark place. She has been suggesting I get on subs bc what I’m doing now isn’t working (she’s got a point). I also have all the MAT bashing judgmental voices in the back of my head that I’ve heard over the years in 12 step fellowships. 

I got the vivitrol shot a few weeks ago and that’s honestly the only way I’ve been able to stay off the stuff for 27 days. My friend gave me an 8mg subutex pill. I wasn’t sure I’d feel anything with the vivitrol but I figured it may at least settle my stomach some as I am still experiencing diarrhea daily since quitting. Vivitrol did not completely block the bupe. I felt like a weight was lifted from me and I could breathe easier. My darkness was exposed to some light and I felt almost normal again. I began to feel like myself and less fatigued. I could laugh and joke and be my usual smartass self. Of course when I woke up the next day I was back to feeling depressed and crying without warning. 

So after a taste of what it would be like on subs I can’t stop thinking about it and trying to know what the right thing is for me. I would appreciate any insight or personal experience with this. I apologize for such a long post…I’m a newbie poster.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8417274}"

It’s making me so depressed that no matter how hard I try, or how good I do things it’s just not enough. Then I try to talk about it with others and I get the whole “sHes yOuR mOm lOvE aNd rESpeCt hEr”. Fuck that. She’s a narcissist cunt, who can’t own up to shit and a control freak. Anytime I try to tell her how I feel I’m “stupid” for feeling that way or I’m told to shut up because exposes what she’s doing wrong, and narcissist can’t be wrong. Anyways. Let’s hope I find a solution soon before I blow my brains out. Like I got to AA and it’s always an inconvenience to her, I go to the gym and it’s “too much” for my weak recovering self, I work and 3 full days of work is too much, I care for my kids, but since it’s not to her illogical routine I’m doing it wrong. But when she wants to go on vacation for a week at a time I’m totally fit to take care of my kids by MYSELF. Hmmmm. 7 and 1 year olds? Can’t do a 30 minute beginners CrossFit routine, but I can care for 2 kids. Interesting. Well like I said. Idk anyone here, my options are small.

I will go through 5 or 6 days without anything and really try my hardest to stay clean then a trigger may happen and I grab and then binge another week or so until I hate myself and feel so much regret that I know I need to stop again. Then go through withdrawal all over, again and again. 

The last time I tried to stop I did 6 days and this was a couple weeks ago. The one thing that helped a lot was this subreddit and engaging with posts and people on here.

I really need support and someone to talk to and I’m hoping Monday I can start fresh and try again and really stay clean this time, but I’m afraid and feel alone as I have no one to talk to about this and no one that understands.

I’m reaching out to this sub and seeing if anyone is actually available to private message with me and help by conversation and support. Someone that will actually reply and talk with me and not just send me a message and ignore my reply for a week :( 

If there is anyone that can be this person for me, please pm me, I really need some support this coming week.

Since 2015, my period cycle has changed drastically, and I recently did a home test for menopause which was positive.  I am doing another one later in the month and I am trying to get my FSH levels tested by my GP, who is simply not bothered at all.

One other blood test I had a while back picked up raised prolactin levels as well, but this was written off by the GP to be from the Subutex?. 

I am 35 years old, I also have high functioning Autism, which led me into this mess to begin with. 

I have grown up since then, and turned into a much more sensible, rational person. 

However I have been experiencing extreme symptoms of menopause, some of which have stopped, and gone, and others which have developed. I have been through a good year of hot flushes and night sweats, which have stopped now, and my periods and related symptoms are very, very different to what they used to be. 

I also go from being a very logical, 'reserved' kind of person, who is well in control of all my emotions and feelings, to someone who has NO control over those things at all. These changes are very sudden, and one episode almost lead to me being arrested. I am NOT like this, I am usually stoical and calm most of the time. I go through very sudden changes that just make me feel like my mind broke. I cannot carry on like this.

Some months I hardly have a period at all, some months are very late, others last one day etc. I used to be very regular and 'normal' in this regard. 

I am not asking for direct medical advice, I just wondered if any other women had experienced an early menopause following chronic opiate dependence and treatment. 

I have to get the results of that test confirmed. I will be glad if this is the case, because I have lost so much of my life to my 'cycles'. 

I am aware of the bone risk, but there are no bone issues in our family, and rather than accept HRT, I will manage by eating well, and if I need a bone scan every now and again, fine, but I cannot risk HRT. I have been advised to avoid all hormones because of the mood disturbances I am already suffering. 

I also have suspected endometriosis, and I would like to know if this will go away once my ovaries pack up altogether. It is of NO psychological consequence to me if this is the case, I have never wanted children, or been able to sustain a relationship in such a way that would be conducive to raising them. It's also very likely I have been infertile most of my life too, because of the endo, so would very likely not have been able to conceive anyway. 

The stuff I was addicted to was OTC combination medications with codeine and ibuprofen mixed up together, so maybe the ibuprofen also did something to me?. 

My best friend died following his battle with OTC codeine (same stuff as me) and alcohol, I cannot expect to have gotten away with mine that lightly, I did something to my body that's for sure. 

Thanks, as I said, not so much advice I am after really, I'm just interested to see if any other women report this happening to them following long term opiate use that's all. 

I will never touch the stuff again, the endo has caused me unimaginable pain, including cyclical attacks of sciatic nerve pain, but I have other ways of managing that.

I suffer from chronic pain due to a car accident. What I have is called CRPS and it sucks. The pain is unreal. I’ve been on every pain med you can imagine and nothing helps.

I was taking 4 20mg pharma oxycodone a day. Then a “friend” gave me a “blue”. Said it would help. And it did. But I needed more and more and now I need ten a day.

For the record, I swallow them like a regular pill. If I’m in horrific pain sometimes I put it under my tongue.

But they don’t work anymore. And I don’t know what to do. The cost of buying these is killing me. I still get my monthly script for 20mg oxy but I can take 4 and it doesn’t touch the pain. I only take them to stay out of withdrawal and because I’m guessing they still help a bit.

I’m so scared and alone and don’t know what to do. I’m obviously addicted to these pills and terrified of quitting because of the pain that will come back. I’ve been reading these boards and I guess I’ve destroyed my tolerance.

I can’t go to rehab because I must work. Plus I don’t see myself as that type of addict? I do take them for pain. But rehab would take me off everything and I’d probably never get a narcotic script again and I don’t think I’d survive the pain. They don’t call CRPS the “Suicide Disease” for nothing.

So can anyone give any advice? I’m so scared and lost and most importantly dreading the pain. That’s what it all gets down to…keeping the pain away.

Right now my pain is particular bad because of a flare and bad weather and I’m just so lost and need to talk to someone who can’t maybe help me or give me some advice.

2021-12-25 01:36:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ro4a5l/i_cant_be_alone/,I Can't Be Alone,"One of my biggest triggers/causes for my addiction is loneliness/boredom. Whenever I'm alone, and not super invested in something (oftentimes television or video games aren't investing enough), I get incredibly anxious. It's hard for me to explain why, although I saw one reddit user post: ""being alone with yourself when you have no idea who you are/rejected all parts of yourself as a kid is one of the worst feelings alive, you're forced to face all the things you've been trying to run away from or distract yourself from, and you see how you truly feel about yourself. When you don't have a personality or anything to mimic or focus on, you feel like nothing, which is definitely not fun.""

That really resonated with me, so I guess I feel empty inside and I've been using fentanyl to fill that void. Before fentanyl, I let 7 people crash in my tiny 2 bedroom apartment because I couldn't bare the thought of being alone, even though that led to them disrespecting me and my home. Before that, I stayed in an abusive relationship for years because I would rather be in his company than alone, even if he hurt me. This past year, fent has been what I used whenever I found myself alone with my thoughts, to numb myself from thinking. I can't even describe what anxious thoughts I'm numbing.

I'm 25 days clean, and I'm on the vivitrol shot and getting drug tested 3 times weekly. That anxiety is still here and it's still triggering and I don't know what to do. Every single time I find myself alone, and now it's started happening sometimes when I'm with people too, which had never happened before so I guess it's gotten worse. Before fentanyl, it just felt like crippling anxiety. Now, it feels like that, and that my brain NEEDS to get high (not that I want to get high, but that I absolutely need to), except I CANT get high, and so my brain is in crisis mode. I'm in a PHP/IOP program for the next three months and am talking to my therapist about this, but so far I haven't been able to utilize any healthy coping skills because when this happens I feel like I physically can't do anything at all. To avoid this, I try to keep busy by working a lot and making plenty of plans, but there will always be times like these I can't avoid. 

I was wondering, firstly, if anyone here has experienced similar triggers and can share advice. I was also wondering, secondly, if I need anti-anxiety medication. I've been on wellbutrin and prozac for months with no noticeable improvements, so I was curious if there were anxiety medication I could take during episodes like these that would calm my brain down. I don't really know anything about anxiety medication, though, and I don't want to trade my opioid addiction for a benzo addiction.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.86444813}"

I’ve tried to CT wds but I couldn’t handle it and I’m not exactly in the right environment to white knuckle it out. I’m scared of pwd so please hear this method out.

I’ve tapered down a little bit from 5 dirty m30s to about 3.5 a day, I want to taper down a little bit more but I don’t really have much time and resources. 

My plan to get off now is to keep tapering with the rest of my stash and then switch from these dirty m30s to real  rx pills so I can get on subs. What do you think of this?

I can’t wait the 72 hours ct from fent to get on subs so I want to go from the fent to real rx pills for about 5 days. My thought process is to use just enough rx pills to not wd from fent. I’m thinking that while on the rx pills the fent would be leaving my body so around day 5 of just rx pills I’ll be able to take a suboxone once wds start hitting from the rx pills and I won’t have pwd and I’ll be done with opiates once and for all. 


Back when my habit was only 2-3 m30s a day I would be able to take a suboxone the next day when wds started, so I’m hoping the 5 days on rx pills is enough time to be able to take a sub without risking pwd

Bernese method-ish"," I made this post originally for the fentanyl subreddit but I wasn't allowed to cross post it here because that is an 18 and over sub and that is against the rules here I guess. So, I'm just making a new post for this sub, sorry if you've already seen it on the other sub, just trying to help others out since the question is asked so frequently...

So there seems to be quite a bit of confusion on this sub about micro-induction of buprenorphine, frequently referred to as the Bernese method of induction. How much sub to take? When should I take it? How much fent do I use? Does it have to be powder or pills? There seems to be quite a bit of ambiguity to the doses and schedule. The range of answers given by users in this sub is likely due to there not being just one correct way. Micro-induction of buprenorphine can be done a variety of ways. I finally put my B.S. in Pharmacology to good use to benefit this community as opposed to just reading scholarly articles to help me get more fucked up. In this post I will summarize my research and be presenting a case study which I did. The ""case study"" being me and my experience.

Standard Induction

The standard induction is what we have all originally learned, wait until you are so sick you can't take it anymore... and then wait some more. With real heroin or oxycodone this was much simpler. Wait 12-24 hours until you've got watery eyes and stomach problems and you were good to go; 8mg and 30 min later and you were on the other side. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) suggests that the person must be at least at an 12 on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) before taking their dose. With fentanyl being mixed into every street opioid from heroin to ""30s/blues/percs"" pills, it is getting harder and harder to make the transition to bupe using the standard induction. This is due to fentanyl and it's analogs being fat soluble and lingering in the body for days or even weeks after last use, especially for heavy, habitual users. Taking bupe too early will take someone experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms to severe withdrawal symptoms in under an hour, this is known as precipitated withdrawal (PWD.) The magic number normally given here is 72 hours, but can vary with users reporting no PWD after 48 hours to severe PWD after 80 hours of abstinence. Beside the mental craving to taking an opioid, having to sit in mild to moderate withdrawal for several days until an 11 on the COWS is reached has proven too difficult for many. Thankfully, there are other ways.

[Link to COWS calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/cows-score-opiate-withdrawal)

The Bernese Method

This seems to be the most commonly referred to method on this sub for micro-dosing induction. [First done in Switzerland and published in German in 2010](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0030-1261914), they successfully transitioned a female heroin user, who had difficulty with the standard induction, by first giving the user 0.2mg of bupe while she continued her regular use of heroin. Over several days, the bupe was increased so that by the 6th day, she was taking 8mg per day and no longer required heroin. The study reports that ""only minor stress and distress"" occurred for the patient. This is the only study that I will reference where I was only able to read the abstract and not the full paper due to a paywall, all other studies I will mention were available for free, primarily on pubmed central (PMC). The original study did not get much attention from others in the addictive medicine field. This could be due to a few reasons: it was just a single case report, the article was written in German, access to the article was behind a paywall that may not have been accessible by professionals/academics outside of Switzerland/Europe, or most likely because there was no need since every opiate addict not on methadone was on a short-acting opiate. At the time, pill mill clinics were prescribing sickening amounts of opiates from hydrocodone to oxymorphone and everything in between, and heroin was good ol' diacetylmorphine.

After using the same technique to help multiple patients, Swiss Psychiatrist Dr. Robert Hammig, decided to it was time to [publish another case study, this time showing how the Bernese Method worked a variety of ways.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959756/) The publication proved that it would work regardless of what opiate and dose, and that the time and dose schedule could be adjusted according to whatever the provider deemed appropriate, working in both inpatient and outpatient settings. I'll give a brief rundown of the schedule, if you want to know exactly what was taken on which days and how bad her wd symptoms were, then click the fucking link and look at the tables in the article. The first example has the patient start day 1 with 0.2mg of bupe and 2.5 grams of street heroin. By the fifth day, she was up to 5mg of bupe and used the last of her heroin, half a gram. She continues upping the bupe and by day 9 is stable on 12mg. The second case in the study also started at 0.2mg of bupe on day one, and that's where the similarities end. This patient was not purchasing his heroin off the street, but instead was enrolled in a heroin maintenance treatment. Yes, you read that right. Moving to Switzerland is no longer just the dream of those that love skiing and mountaineering, but it's every junkies dream relocation. Heroin maintenance in Switzerland involves attending the clinic TWICE daily, receive pharmaceutical diacetylmorphine while in the clinic (IV or oral) and then having a methadone take home to not WD at night. A formula is used to calculate the strength of his full opiate agonist and was converted to taking the equivalent of what milligrams of methadone. This guy was taking the equivalent of 130-180mg of methadone a day!!!!!! It took 28 days for him to reach his stable bupe dose of 24mg/day. On day 28 he took his last agonist, 800mg of DAM and 40mg of methadone, equal to a dose of 140mg of methadone/day. The following day he reported yawning as his only wd symptom and it only lasted for that one day, followed by another 5 days of reporting 0 withdrawal symptoms.

The Bernese method has since been published in several scientific journals by multiple research groups using a variety of schedules and different opiates as the main agonist. [This publication was the best I could find that compared different full opiate agonists/amounts of agonist using the same dosing schedule](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7919736/). This article is additional confirmation that quantity of the full-agonist being used does not matter. The first three cases have a range of the amount of full agonist, Sustained Release Oral Morphine (SROM), with the exact same outcome, no PWD, minimal to no WD. Albeit, all amounts of SROM and even the methadone quantity (30 mg) used in this study are quite week. What is concerning about this study is that the 4 cases that used an opiate assisted treatment (OAT) were confirmed by Urine Analysis to only have bupe as an opiate at the one month follow up. Whereas the 3 cases that did not use OAT but used street dope instead all ended up relapsing. The 4 OAT cases are described to have reduced their dose over time in anticipation of the switch to bupe, whereas the non-OAT cases made no mention of tapering down the amount of dope used. Hammig proved in the previous study we looked at that dose tapering is not required to avoid PWD, as proven by Case 2 in his study that was taking 180mg of methadone. However, that patient followed a much slower increase of his bupe than this study. All participants avoided PWD, but lacking from this study is the COWS/SOWS/OOWS which would inform us how bad the withdrawal is. In Hammig's Case 2, [a table with time, bupe, SOWS, and even the actual wd symptoms is provided.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959756/table/t2-sar-7-099/?report=objectonly) Lastly, when comparing the post induction/long term outcome of cases 1-4 vs 5-7 we should take note of their willingness or the degree of how bad they wanted the switch to bupe. The first four cases were all willing to at least even get on an OAT. In addition to joining these, the article states that all four cases on OAT actively reduced their doses in anticipation of the switch to bupe. The first 4 cases were patients who were clearly motivated to make the switch.

Lets recap the Bernese method. A typical dose [schedule will look like this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7919736/table/T2/?report=objectonly), although the creator of the method recommends the first day starting on 0.2mg. Tbh, I don't believe there's much of a difference between 0.2mg and 0.5mg. While it is recommended to taper down the amount of fent you are using prior to induction, it's actually not necessary. Just know that the longer, heavier habits will have more wd symptoms with higher COWS/SOWS scores or will take longer because of slower increases of bupe to keep wd to a minimum or non-existent. There are several different jump off points. The most common is 8mg/day, although others stop the fent at less. Once you've hit 8mg of suboxone in one day though, you can stop the fent, and next day take all 8mg at once, and if that is not enough to get you well, keep taking 2-4mg every 2-3 hours until you feel not sick. Don't try to get high, you're getting on subs for a reason. Minor withdrawal symptoms are normal and to be expected, don't be a complete pussy and stop crying that it's just too hard because it took away your nod. No shit, you're not supposed to be falling out in public anymore. These are minor symptoms like the chills, some body aches, and yawning. All anxiety is really in your head realizing that you can no longer use this as an escape from life's shittiness. And all minor wd symptoms will be gone in a day or less. Congrats! You've avoided precipitated withdrawal! Looks like you wont be shitting your pants as you simultaneously vomit and cry to your creator for an instant death.

Rapid Micro-Induction of Buprenorphine (The Bernese Method on steroids)

Despite all the great things I read about the Bernese Method, I was still reluctant to give it a go due to the finances of it. It seemed like a waste to buy a week's worth of fent that I wouldn't even get high on just to be on suboxone. I had just gotten 50+ hours of no fent earlier in the week when I found a rock (0.1g or less) under my couch and caved in. I was so close to 72 hours, now I theoretically was back to 0. Could I micro-dose the subs without having to continue with the fent? I kept changing the wording in my searches until I stumbled upon this. [Comparing rapid micro-induction and standard induction of buprenorphine/naloxone for treatment of opioid use disorder.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881636/) It wasn't exactly what I was looking for since it still involved the continuing to take the preferred opioid, commonly referred to in these articles as ""overlap of full agonist."" Still, it was the first time I had seen an article mention rapid micro-induction. I was shocked when I seen the dose [schedule and amount.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881636/table/Tab1/) The first day involves induction with 0.5mg of bupe, but unlike the traditional Bernese method where you'd wait until the following day to dose again, this method involved dosing again every 3 hours to ideally get to 4mg on the very first day. Day 2 follows the same schedule to dose every 3 hours, except now the amount is 1mg of bupe. By the end of the second day, you would reach the therapeutic dose of 8mg/day, and there would no longer be any need to take fent after the second day. Day 3 you start with a full dose of 8mg or even 16mg and if still feeling symptoms of withdrawal, you could take an additional 4mg of bupe every 3 hours until wd symptoms are extremely minor or gone completely. I couldn't believe it, could it really be that easy? I thought the magic behind the Bernese method working was because of the gradual increase in dose given every 12 or 24 hours. This paper is advocating that it can be done in 48 hours and could possible have better outcomes than the standard induction method. Note, that this is just a proposed protocol for a future randomized clinical trial. There is no actual data here. When I first read the article on my induction day and seen the 48 hour rapid micro induction, I decided instantly that this is the schedule I'd follow and instantly took another 0.5mg of bupe. Only when I started to get minor wd symptoms and wanted to check the average COWS for it did I realize this was just a proposal...

Additional articles supporting the three hour dose schedule method could be found in the works cited. The only one not behind a paywall was of [a woman who underwent back surgery and was put on multiple opioids, including methadone in the 21 days after her surgery.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147949/) To better manage her pain, on the 22 day post surgery, the initiated a 3 day induction. Doses were also given every three hours and her [COWS was reported daily, never exceeding a 5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147949/table/T1/) While this case is of a patient suffering from pain management, there were also articles documenting the 3 hour dose for patients suffering from OUD. Even though it is behind a paywall, [this article](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Rapid-micro-induction-of-buprenorphine%2Fnaloxone-for-Klaire-%C5%BDivanovi%C4%87/53dd6a8e2174190acc1c9463d518c97db861fc5f) states that 2 patients suffering from OUD were transitioned onto bupe without causing PWD. No info about their use history, but the two tables that can be seen along with the abstract show the dosing schedule. One patient was dosing every 4 hours and discontinued agonist after 4 days, whereas the other patient was dosing every 3 hours and stopped taking agonist after 2 days.

What if I run out of fent? Can I still micro-induce so I don't have to sit around and wait until its 72 hours?

There's not loads of stud out there to support this being a good idea until at least 48 hours. There are some studies that talk about putting people on bupe patches that release slowly, like 20micrograms/hour and that people do fine on them even within 30 min of last use, but the moment they take 1mg before the 40 hour mark they get super sick. [This study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ajad.13069) even states that they tried to induce 4mg bupe on fentanyl users after 24 hours and suprise suprise, PWD. The study then says they took two other participants and waited until the 48 hour mark and dosed 2mgs, which was fine... but then they dosed another 2mg just another hour later and... yeah, not good. After all the research I've done, if I make it to 48 hours, i'd induce a 0.5mg then wait 3 hours to induce 1mg, and continue that three hour 1 mg until i notice a significant change. either things get worse and i stop or things start to get much better and I go to a higher dose.

Why microdose at all?

[The Pharmacology of Buprenorphine Microinduction for Opioid Use Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020374/)

The pharmacology shows that microinduction of bupe does more than just push off full agonists off the receptor and then just partially activate it. The article states that microinduction on bupe can reverse the downregulation of the mu opiate receptor that occurs from prolonged, repeated use of the full on agonists. This will make bring more functional receptors to the surface and allow for more binding sites for the bupe or full agonist. The authors also mentions that there need to be more studies done to truly understand the MOA for why microdosing bupe seems to be so beneficial.

How I did it?

Tried to lower my dose as much as possible. Then I tried to make it to the 72 hour make and slowly induce 1mg at a time. That's the only way I had success in the past. But after finding a tiny rock in my apartment, I had to reset to zero. So I said I'd try the Bernese method. After researching it for a bit though, I decided to do a version of the rapid micro induction.

Day1 0.5mg X 3 (three hours apart and then sleep) total of 1.5mg

Day 2 1.0 mg around 10am, 1mg at 1pm, got cocky and took 1mg at 2pm and then started to feel some super mild wd... took 1mg at 6 pm and another 1mg at 10 for a total of 5 mg finished all my fetty only 0.3mg worth over 2 days.

Day 3 1 mg at at 11am 1 mg at 2am... but since I was out of dope I was too scared to take any more... so i waited until I picked up after 8pm. then i took 2mg after not using all day and felt much better. picking up was pointless so 4mg total

Day 4 Today Woke up, took 4 mg around 10am. feel great. Tried to smoke some of the fetty I got yesterday but don't feel shit. will take another 4mg tonight and get rid of the fetty. looks like I'm in the clear.

Microdosing really is the best way to get onto bupe from fent. no need to suffer the WD for days. Hopes this helps someone else out.

Two additional methods to get on bupe from street fent. First we have the ""bridge"" method. This is when you go from fent to a short acting opiate for a week, before then doing the standard induction. Cited paper says to use pharma fent to get off of methadone and onto bupe. Don't know too many doctors that would prescribe a short acting opiate for a week that could match a fentanyl tolerance. The last way is truly the fastest way. [It is also the worst way possible](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7641008/) imo. It involves taking a dose of naltrexone prior to your bupe. Once the PWD from the naltrexone is causing you to vomit and shit yourself, you'll be stoked to be given some bupe!",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48519048}"

This is the first year since 2016 that I haven’t been using prescription painkillers. I just passed 9 months on 12/14/21 after years of relapsing and being controlled by opiates.

I didn’t give a shit about who I hurt along the way and the times I did stay sober for a little bit was only to please people. I didn’t want sobriety. But on March 14,2021 it finally just clicked.

I work hard for my sobriety and love every minute of it. I have NO desire to ever go back to that dark space and I know in my heart that I can’t even use one more time because I am an addict and one more time would never be enough. To anyone out there struggling, know that recovery is possible and it is a process! It seems like it can be so far from reach at the beginning and I never thought I could make it to 30 days let alone 9 months and I did it! My life has turned around for the good.

•>LOPERAMID you can get it otc also in like every where in the world google bout that its actually an weak opioid itself that helps with not sitting on toilet all day😃 
•>Semax (peptide & nootropic that works on endogenous opioid system wich the whole opioid receptor system is a part of also neuroregenerative meaning its builds new brain cells in the hippocampus over the death ones addiction and drug use has done it to all of us in some degree its also anxiolytic & antidepressant with natural stimulation properties cant say nothing but recommend to everyone and its legal all over world cause its on the cray area (noots/peptides),  
•>TIANEPTINE is great for wd but it takes backbone to not relapse to recreationally use it cause its an pretty strong opioid also when used recreationally 
• >BLACK SEED OIL (has some mu-opioid receptor activity it also great for overall health so great for wd:s) so def go grab a bottle from a local supplement store its also legal on everywhere in world  
•>TESTOSTERONE go to check your levels cause their 80% surely love af so it wouldnt hurt cause long term opiate/opioid use cuts bodys testorene production to 80yo mans stage, and would get legally ether T-gel or vials for I.M. shots of sustanon. Or just buy it from street or local gyms.
•>PHENIBUT great for wd:s was it benzos or opiates this stuff helps ALOT i recommend F-phenibut or phenibut FAA over regural but whatever easiest to get go with that.
•>KRATOM(i know not legal in many places anymore but customs rarely pick up small 50-200g bag of kratom and dogs dont know the smell of kratom as a drug.
•>CBD(oils,weed,hash,vapes)its helps alot for insomnia and muscle pains/spasms and anxiety.

I do one up her nose, she slightly came to. I grab my phone and try to call 911 as we go up the stairs to ground level so the EMT would reach her faster. I'm in a complete panic and so is our son who happened to be hanging out with me when this all happened. We get to the top of the stairs I yell for our daughter to call 911 and tell them it's an overdose. We get my wife into the living room and we're trying to keep her up and moving. Not knowing what else to do my son was pouring ice water down her back. Then she just collapses into the floor and quit breathing. Her lips were turning blue and nothing was bringing her around. I narcaned her a second time and did mouth to mout it took what seemed like forever but she finally came too. Finally the police show up to ""clear the scene"" because that's something they do around us before EMT or fire will enter. Because I narcaned her they said there wasn't much they could do but take her to the hospital. In the ER she was out of it...shit herself, started masturbating in front of everybody. It was a horrible night. 
The next day after our kids spoke to her and etc she decided that was it. She started treatment, taking subs and has been clean ever since. This is the first 10 1/2 months she's been clean in 16 years. This is our first Christmas of her being clean in 16 years. I'm so fucking proud of her. I wish there was something I could say or do to show anybody else that getting clean is achievable. We take it day by day..but one day has turned into 1 week, 1 week into 1 month etc...God bless you all. I just needed to share.",61,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3880471}"

My question is when can I start subs? before this 6month stint I was using 1-2 a day and was able to take a sub once I started wding the next day. I was able to do this during the early part of the beginning as well. BUT sometime like 6 weeks ago I took a sub a day after (used at like midnight the night before took a sub at like 430pm next day, also wasn’t really in wds) and it sent me into pwd and it def gave me ptsd. Recently during my taper (past 3 weeks or so) I’ve taken roughly a 1mg of sub a day after/when wds started showing up and I couldn’t tell if I was better or worse so I used. So again how long do you think I should wait to get on subs? Was I just anxious and using to early after taking the sub? I feel like 1mg should’ve been enough to give me pwds if I was gonna get it. Any input is appreciated I’ve only definitely had pwds once before when taking a sub a day later. I just want off these pills and want to get on subs for a lil to get my life back

In just a couple weeks I ruined multiple relationships with people but I was so fucked up all the time I didn’t care. I ended up going through a manic episode for a week or two and once it was over I broke down so hard. I don’t wanna live my life like this anymore. I don’t wanna wake up and the first thing I do is hit the foil just so I don’t get sick. Im tired of the insomnia I give myself after I stop doing xans or dope, literally. I don’t wanna live my life craving drugs anymore, it always ends up in a psychotic break. 

I went to the weekly AA meeting a couple weeks ago after getting 3 days sober but I relapsed 20 minutes after the meeting. It’s so hard when I get it for $40/g, it’s so cheap and so good, but I can’t give in to the cravings or I’ll just end up back at day 1, sober and going through the worst of the withdrawls for the next couple days. It feels so good to be clean and actually have true motivation to STAY clean, but once it hits 9pm all I can think about is picking up a bag.

Hope you are well. I've seen better days in my personal life but am not using so that's good!

Wanted to bring you all's attention to a free recovery program called Recovery Dharma. It is a Buddhist based recovery program based on the teachings of the Buddha; the four noble truths and the 8-fold path. 

I'd always been drawn to Buddhism and knew some about it so this program really struck a chord with me. They have meetings online and in person all over the world. I have a few meetings I attend regularly but the nice part is you can drop in to any meeting; some are better than others. 

Meetings are structured similar to 12 step but it is not 12 step. They generally open with introductions followed by a reading, 15-20 minutes of meditation, another short reading, and then shares. Shares are often timed so people don't go too long.

Click the link below, you can select whatever time zone you are in and it will show you times for tons of meetings. Be mindful the list is old and occasionally (but rarely) a meeting is defunct. There is a meeting for every major metropolitan area and then some generalized world-wide meetings. I've met people in recovery all over the world from this program and I am back to meditating everyday because of it.

Hope this is helpful to some of you. I know 12 step just wasn't my thing and I feel majorly at home in RD. All the best <3

I am on the verge of suicide thinking about the long road of recovery ahead. I snorted fentanyl for a just over a year and at my worst I was using about a gram a day. I wound up in the hospital because the wd’s nearly killed me. I am now on methadone/kadian for maintenance. 60 mg methadone, 540 mg kadian in the morning and 430 at night. I’m tapering off the methadone and going up on the kadian because it’s easier for my work (I’m a professional musician and need to travel frequently). I guess I would like to ask if there’s anyone out there that has able to get off that much medication and become clean. When I think about the amount of medication I’m taking I feel like I’ll never be able to get to zero. I want to go back to the hospital and have another go at supervised withdrawal but in Canada, it doesn’t seem like that’s an option. I don’t know if I’m strong enough to slowly tapper for years. I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do get off the medication all at once. I just would appreciate any encouragement or words of advice.

I kept it to that one time until November, when I started using once or twice a week (fent presses). I avoided withdrawals completely as I am scared shitless of fent wd’s (been there, done that). By the end of November I was using 4-5 times a week and taking kratom on the days off. Still, no major withdrawal. 

At the beginning of December I went a whole week of using, then took 2 days off, then used for another whole week. Which leads me to where I’m at now (2 days clean). I’m using kratom as sparingly as I can to make it by, as I’ve been hooked bad on that in the past. I plan to drop the kratom by this weekend, then I’ll have 2 weeks off for holiday. 

So far the withdrawals haven’t been fun, but they haven’t been torturous either, as I wasn’t in nearly as deep as I have been before. I’m hoping I feel somewhat better by the 24th, as I’m seeing my family which is really important to me.

I think he was as high as 60 mg per day, was at 40 mg per day as recently as September.

He made the decision to get off of them back in September, when he found how well CBD oil worked to help his pain.

He was clearly dependent on the oxy after all that time, so we decided to taper him off slowly. I've held the pills for him and we made a spreadsheet with all the dosing and dates (yep, I'm a nerd), and he's been doing great. Dropped about 2.5 mg each time, and he's had zero signs of withdrawal.

We're now in the home stretch. He's at 7.5 mg, we're dropping to 5 mg daily tomorrow. That's two 2.5 mg doses. He'll be there for 4 days, then 2.5 mg for 4 days, then done.

Our ENTIRE intent with this plan was to minimize his discomfort while retraining his body to not be dependent on oxy. And it's worked.

So why am I (not him, ME) so nervous about his last 8 days of taking pills? I'll freely admit, I have zero experience with physical withdrawals from opioids. And he's doing fine so far. So why am I worried that he'll have a tough time?

Is jumping off at such a low dose super difficult? Will he be ok? We don't want to use other substances to help withdrawals (if any, probably won't be any). I guess maybe I'm more worried about the emotional impact..... he's been so used to having that go to pill for so many years.....

I've known people who got off heroin, but have maintained a healthy relationship with other drugs including the ability to pick up a drink and not getting back into a habit.

One of my best friends was a heroin addict. Quit heroin after hitting rock bottom. Clean from heroin for 6 years, she still occasionally gets drunk, does coke a little more than most, but is able to maintain a financially stable lifestyle and not lose all of her family and friends like she did when she was doing heroin. 

My mother, for example, was an alcoholic most of her youth. Lost most of her kids due to that. Now, she can have a very occasional drink and put it down without spiraling.

Basically, why do people swear that you have to do the steps, and never touch a mind-altering substance ever again, and if you do, you WILL relapse and if you relapse and continue touching drugs / alcohol, you will end up at rock bottom every time.

Have you or some u know attempted and had success ? please help!!!

some questions someone else in my position wrote out that I too am wondering : 

1) will methadone help me get through about the first 3 days if WD.
2) will I be able to take it for 3 days and then stop with mild wd or will I still be in full WD? What's a good mg taper? Like day 1 #mg, day 2 #mg, etc
3) do I have to wait to take methadone like you do suboxone? It's the main reason why I'm not going to use sub to taper , I'm terrified of PWD . 
4) any other general advice for me?
I'll have gabbapentin,fluxeral, benzos,  and kratom  on hand to help when I stop the methadone.

Constipation become much more evident about a month ago, and now I constantly feel bloated and backed up. Still manage to ‘go’ every 2-3 days, but will only be a few, small, rock-hard pieces - maybe half the size of golf balls. Plenty of straining, of course. No particular relief felt afterwards - always feel like there’s more to come, but it’s not happening. 

Now been dreading this necessary cold turkey quit,bc it’s always my stomach issues that hit the hardest and fastest. I’ll start throwing up and not be able to stop - mostly from pure pain :/

Never done an enema, but wondering if they’d be useful for this - anyone had any success with an enema to treat OIC? 

Would really appreciate any advice/comments/help you all could pass along! 

Its going to be a tough couple of weeks, but I’m looking forward to 2022 being an incredible year. And it’s time to get to work on quitting this trash - right now.

I was supposed to fly out to the country my mom is from and where most of my family on both sides still lives for this Christmas, but between omicron and issues boarding my dog we had to postpone. I'm upset but I'm also relieved Cuz I gotta admit I was extremely stressed about flying and my dog being in a strange place away from me for a week. I haven't been out to that country for almost 8 years, we used to go every summer for like 1-2 months when I was a kid so I do really miss it. But hopefully I'll be able to go in the spring.  

There was some post on a bigger subreddit that was this little animation metaphor for addiction, it was really well done and ofc I went and looked in the comments. Some kid was commenting who was obv still in the teetering stage of having one part of his brain want to get clean, but the rest saying fuck it, and just feeling trapped in his (or her, idk) addiction. Ofc I replied with some encouraging words, but it also brought me back to the months I spent in that limbo ish space and how awful it was and how grateful I am to be clean. Tmrw is my 32 months clean date. Which isn't really that much time but at the same time is an amount of time that seemed insurmountable to me when I was using. I'm def grateful for the life I now have and the fact I was no longer using.  

It's cheesy af but when I first got clean, bullet Journaling helped me a lot (esp Cuz I've always loved drawing n shit) n I had this gratitude log thing which, even though at the time (and now tbh) I found kinda silly, actually helped me out sooo much. And even now when I get depressed or hopeless and have minor moments of weakness, it helps to think of the things I'm grateful for since getting clean, both big and small.  

Wow I meant to keep this short but i cannot keep my fucking mouth shut lmao. How is everyone else doing today? What are two small (or big) things that you're grateful for in your post-using life, whether it's been 5 days or 5 years? I know the holidays can be a stressful time for everyone esp addicts so I hope everyone is doing alright and has some coping mechanisms in place to deal with whatever minor stresses come y'all way.

fuck. prolly give me some subs and like 1mg diazepam or some shit, when i could eat 3 bars and  barely feel shot while in WD. and fuck man, i got a benzo habit too, 2mg alpraz equivalent but it’s clonazolam a rc benzo that won’t pop on drug tests, so idek if they’ll give me a benzo then if im not pissing dirty for em.

and then my parents will know i’ve relapsed and shit and i’ll worry everyone again and i’ll be locked up there with no phone even to keep my the slightest bit entertained, have some connection with the outside world.

i’d pretty much like rather die or just stay high on H than go to rehab. it seems like a nightmare. i don’t trust them to adequately medicate me, and i’d have to quit fucking H benzos and weed all at once . i’m barely getting by with benzos and weed and alcohol, they don’t do shit in comparison to H.

idk i’m just so lost, i feel like rehab wouldn’t do shot for me either and it would just be some bullshit that won’t help me. i feel like i would just suffer, sick as fuck, bored out of my mind. luckily i could leave if i wanted ig, but if i was like trapped there i’d prolly fuckik kill myself in there to end the misery.

why even bother with all this bulkshkt? why not just stay high and stay feeling ok. and say fuck all this bull shit, fuck all the pain and suffering when i can take it all away and not just be ok but feel good actually and be able to smile and joke around and shit.

how the fuck they gonna make me happy without drugs, liek what even they gonna do? i’m extremely skeptical.

and i’m not like most addicts.. for one i know my shit, some extensive research since 14 years old, but like i feel like the stupid feel good bullshit or whatever that works for normal ppl won’t on me.

there’s part of me that wants to be clean but the other part tells me it’s not realistically possible and that it’s not even worth it cuz shits gonna suck 10x more being sober…

wait: day 4, feeling… eh. gonna try and stick it out. hopefully my sub clinic will just let me keep going to them cuz the IOP place willl kick me off the subs if my thc levels don’t go down and that gonna be hard af when i’m tryna not fucking do heroin like wtf, can’t even smoke some tree to help me stay clean 🤦‍♂️.  ugh. well.. i’ll just see how shit goes i guess",0,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.96261185}"

He’s been fighting addiction for a long time and it just became too much for our relationship. He left on such a sour note but I knew it was coming. The dishonesty, the stealing, the lying and drugs were too much. I’ve never been with someone with addiction issues so this is all very new to me. How do I hurt less knowing he could be out there losing himself? I think of his safety and health probably more than he ever did and while people could say that I’m better off without him, it damn sure doesn’t feel that way. Times were bad but they weren’t always bad. He was my best friend and my everything. I told him things about my childhood I never told anyone. Coming home to all of his things gone is devastating. How do I move on after being with an addict? All I can do is worry worry worry. Worry myself sick he won’t OD and pass away in the streets or some nasty drug house. Do I keep contacting him? Do I just let it go? What do I do now without my best friend in life? My children will ask questions that I’m too frightened to answer. And if he tries to comeback how do I find it in me to forgive? This HURTS. I wish drugs could just leave him alone and vice versa. I just don’t know what to do…. Send a word of advice and please go easy on me…

The first night without him was hard, but it will get better. I believe it to be true.

I got some really mixed feedback, some mentioned they were fine and other said I’d be put on a list and never given meds again.

How I went about telling my doc was essentially me saying how my medication has been running out early and I’ve been struggling with it and explaining why I do it and mostly helping myself saying it isn’t to chase a high which it never had been at least consciously. He asked if I’ve ever gone through or felt like getting more outside of prescriptions to which I said yes and overall it felt very understanding and supportive.

I didn’t get the outcome I was hoping for which was methadone but they did send a referral over to a suboxone clinic and gave me extra clonidine and muscle relaxers.

Since I mentioned I was already on kratom for about a week and a half they are just planning to do a suboxone taper to nothing but also assured me if the pain is still a problem, which it may or may not be according to them, they would look at the next steps for that and methadone isn’t out of the question.

So currently just took my last bit of kratom and planning to call the suboxone clinic to get an appointment. Scared to do so since it’ll mean basically admitting to my parents who will drive me there that I have an issue which they’ll hold over me like everything else till they die.

I am a member of bupe.me Telemedicine and typically I like to post about the research we are doing along the lines of how opiates have literally changed our DNA through DNA methylation. We don't know what the long-term effects are yet we are still learning it's such a new field of study DNA methylation. But today I would like to focus on something a little different. You may not know it but the government more specifically the DEA is trying to take our right away to decide if we want choose MAT as our way of healing ourselves. You can say what you want but sticking a dirty needle in your vein is a hell of a lot different than taking a controlled medication the correct way and not having to deal with the sickness. This is our right to decide to not be sick and the DEA should have no say so in the matter. It's our choice and I'm pro-choice all around.

I lost another year fighting depression with opioids instead of therapy. I cut my dose of dihydrocodeine by 30% and today it'd be 40%, tomorrow I'm flying sober.

I've gone through that many times, 10 years of my life on and off opioids. Managed to have couple of meaningful relationships, but in 2020 I split with my girlfriend after almost 4 years, but we were supposed to get in together in January 2020 - unfortunately I got really sick, nothing related to opioids, but it showed me that my loved one cared for me so little and can't show even a bit of decency(I spend 6 months mostly in bed with horrible nerve pain, she never visited me at home or in the hospital, but it got even worse, because I was the one cheering her up during my darkest time, not the other way around).

Juny of 2020, I'm bored at home, so decide to go out to a bar, celebrating being cured and thinking of new possibilities leaving toxic relationship. I go out solo to the pub I know. I remember drinking one cuba libre and after that... I woke up the next day lying on the floor in the middle of the city center. Managed to go back home, completely blank about what happened the last night. I check my bank account.

Pause.

Check my other four checking accounts.

My face gets pale.

Check all my other savings accounts.

I'm feeling I'm gonna faint.

**All my life's savings gone.**

Went to the police, checked CCTV of the pub I was in, called all my friends who could see me. I had no suspects, I didn't think there was someone who could poison me and rob of all my life's savings. Nobody even knew about all my accounts. Not even my family, nor my brother, nor any ex. You though it was my ex's revenge? No, after we split she went back to the city she was born in, 300 km from me. She wasn't around then, had good alibis and besides, she didn't know about half of my accounts, not to mention passwords to them.

Another thing: I have incredible tolerance to benzodiazepines, opioids and everything. After taking depressants for 10 years I never was taken to the ER, never blacked out, NEVER. Did everything I could do, called bank, the police, called my lawyer... Nothing we could do. In a civilized country I could probably get back at least some of that money or I could find the person, who clearly poisoned me, but I live in Poland(think of Russia, but a lot smaller and weirder), hence I was lost with 10 bucks.

Even though I made many mistakes I made sure to save money to buy my own house, I had already that much and more, but waited for the prices to drop...

Since that incident throughout the rest of 2020 until the February of 2021 I couldn't get out of bed, I took so many opioids, benzodiazepines and other downers, I could drug half the city. 

I'd finally woken up in February this uear, stopped talking opioids, looked for work, had to find something quickly, saw the opening for, as a customer adviser, work I needed but highly beneath my qualifications. Lasted 3 months, then I went back to the same black void, where I had no reasons to live, let alone work. This depression was so crippling, still is, but last months even though I took opioids 2 times a day in high doses(my single dose of DHC after developping tolerance was the same as lethal dose for someone who never took it before - that shows you how much I screwed up) pregabaline 2 times a day, so many benzos... Couldn't pick up shattered pieces of my life.

Finally, the last month gave me a boost of energy, so I detoxed quickly and quickly came back to taking it, so now I'm slowly cutting down the dose in order not to give my body and mind such a shock therapy. 

In the meantime, I'm starting to learn piano, always wanted to do that and as it happens, 2 months ago a friend from work told me she has a free keybord for me, because we talked a lot about music and she knew how much I wanted to learn to play. Lucky me, at least once. Then I picked up 3D modelling, I used to love it years ago, so I'm trying to slowly start taking my life back from the pain of the past.

Sorry for the chaotic writing, I'm insomniac, haven't slept 48 hours and it's still traumatic for me to talk about it. Besides, this post is spontaneous, because I'm still drugged and can't think properly, but I'm re-remembering stuff I used to like and have bursts of energy e.g. to write it. And I'm not a native English speaker, haven't written anything in English for months, so I'm terribly sorry for any mistakes I made.

I have Naltrexone (vivitrol) 50mg tablets I was prescribed before I relapsed on ‘heroin bags’ that are not, but instead some sort of fentanyl… I am finding this go at detoxing to be far more difficult than any of my previous experiences with oxy and heroin. Much more intense and aggressive symptoms of withdrawal, and lasting far longer than anything I’ve experienced. In reading other posts here, I’m not alone in feeling this stuff just sticks around in the system, is relentless, and doesn’t shake off in the same time frames I’ve experienced in previous instances of getting clean.
My question is, if I take some of this Naltrexone would I get this fent out of my system more efficiently and faster? I know I’d be signing up for an intense and miserable experience, but right now that sounds a lot better than the way this has dragged out.

Kinda new to this so here's my shot.

its been a fucking nightmare these pass few months without my younger brother. he died in his sleeps about nine months ago due to fentanyl, and it hasn't gotten easier. today marks my 28th birthday and yet i want nothing but a message from him ""saying happy birthday brother"" or just knowing he's around physically. my little man never told me he had an addiction to Heroine or meth.... And I'm no saint either pretty sure I've tried heroine once by accident thinking it was molly... I only found out about his addiction after the wake. the crazy part he hid it so well from our family and I. I've only notice something once or twice, but he always claimed it was the hospital visits or work. until today it i decided to look up his username on google to see if there's anything else left of him on the internet i.e. photos, videos, audio w.e i could find.

until now i stumbled Apon his account. [https://www.reddit.com/user/doomedrevenge/](https://www.reddit.com/user/doomedrevenge/).

i guess in a weird way this was him showing me that he did look up to me or cared about me so much that he never mention his sustain abused. he was looking for someone to help him out even tho we were one room away from each other....

my reason for writing this is to tell you guys that the society may view you with a stigma but the people that truly love you and care for you don't see you as junkies or druggies. WE want our sibling, baby, friends etc... back to who they truly are... We all trip and fall at times but remember you just have to stop digging your own grave by putting the shovel down.

if you need someone to talk to please reach out to me. I want you guys to have the confidence to seek help! this isnt for me or for my little brother this is for your love ones !!",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5450609}"

Background: I've used various opioids for about 8-9 years with the last 5-6 years being addiction. Turned from casual to addiction after a bad trauma left me depressed and nihilistic. Started with kratom, moved onto kratom + codeine, then DHC, then oxy, morphine, tapentadol, tried methadone and subs and basically binged back and forth for years, mostly DHC, oxy and tapentadol. Got up to about 700mg DHC, 250mg oxy or 1.2g tapentadol a day at my worst from 2020-2021 and sometimes went into awful withdrawals in that time.

I tried quitting several times and have always found it very difficult and relapsed so far. This time I switched from tapentadol to DHC, then codeine + DHC, then slowly tapered down on OTC codeine before the Ayahuasca. I was only having 12.8 - 25.6mg codeine a day for the week before the Ayahuasca, then took 12.8mg a day for 1 week with 7.5mg for the last 2 days before jumping off 11 days ago (about a week after Ayahuasca).

The Ayahuasca experience: I've drank it about 10 times years ago before addiction. It's very intense and often very personal and scary/unpleasant for me. This time I had 1 dose and vomited within minutes but it was still somehow strong. A lot of it went up my nose where I think it got absorbed fast. I heard a ringing tone as it came on, felt scared and started seeing vivid colourful geometric visions with eyes closed. With eyes open I was disorientated and had double vision. At the start I experienced my body being repeatedly scanned by it like a whole body MRI (quite a common experience). 

Then I felt this snake like movement going through my body and went into a sort of ecstatic movement trance. Every part of my body was moving in weird fluid and repetitive ways throughout. I felt strong physical and mental pleasure/euphoria and peace, like all my brain pleasure centres were being turned up high in a way even oxy can't do. The experience was very simple: just body movements, vivid colourful geometry, and euphoria. The trauma or addiction never came up. Just this intensely pleasurable ecstatic trance with simple visions. Lasted a few hours then wore off. I was really worried it would be horrible taking Ayahuasca while trying to quit but it was the nicest experience I've had with it.

Afterwards I've felt happier and more at peace and I found it much easier than normal stopping the codeine that next week. I felt less cravings and more willpower but I've still been struggling quite bad at times with cravings, which started growing a few days after quitting. But so far Ive managed to resist. I had some lingering mild withdrawals but am physically free of withdrawals now.

I feel like the Ayahuasca did some work/rewiring of my pleasure centres and has helped repair the system.

Anyway, thought I should post it as I know many are interested in the idea. Don't expect it to be a miracle cure if you try it but I believe in its potential. Happy to answer any questions if anyone is interested.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47442}"

Day 1- .25mg

2- .5  mg

3- .5 mg

4- 1mg

5- 2 mg

6- 3mg

7- 6 mg

8- 8 mg

9- 8mg


I have been using the normal amount of oxy on top of the Suboxone dose. In part this is because I am still getting what seems to be mild PWD when I take the full 8 mg dose. (although if its mild maybe its not PWD? I have had those before, years ago when getting off H, so I know what they feel like.)


Are there any suggestions of what I am doing wrong? I thought that I would have build up enough of the bupenorphine in my system to be able to take the dose in the morning and feel moderately better, but that does't seem to be the case. When I take the morning dose I am already in mild withdrawal, and then the chills get worse, so I have been using about an hour after the first Suboxone dose. As you know, I don't get high but it takes the withdrawals away. I have also been taking oxy in the evening. Maybe that is where I am going wrong? This is so hard you guys. I just want to live a normal life without cravings. I was clean for a long time but started using this February (10 months ago). I hate that my brain is wired to love opiates. On a low dose they give me energy, lessen the anxiety, and ease my depression. But it's impossible. Eventually tolerance goes up and money runs dry.

I was not even a legal adult yet. I’m not going to go into what went on from 2011 to 2019, but I will just say I was on opioids on and off. There was a good four years of sobriety somewhere in the middle of that and at some point, all the usage picked up and amped up pretty severely. 

What’s important is that today I am 25 months completely sober and I’m happy. My goal in life is to change how people look at addiction, change how people look at recovery, and to reform the criminal justice system and the drug war. I know that these are bold goals and I don’t expect to reach them all or even reach any of them. But if I can change one person’s time perspective,  I’ll be happy.

It is my personal belief that most people are looking at addiction all wrong. I’m not talking about addicts. In fact, I look at them as blameless victims in this whole mess. I’m talking about the supposed ‘addiction professionals’. What’s amazing is that opioid addiction is one of the most deadly diseases for young people in the United States, but research surrounding the issue is almost nonexistent. They have spent almost no money on learning about the best solutions to opioid addiction yet they have spent a ton of money on incarcerating suffering addicts on trumped up charges For example, if someone has a half oz of H on them, it’s automatically assumed that they were selling. There could be concrete proof that their grandmother gave them the money and they immediately bought the drugs to use for themselves. They will still be charged with distribution and most likely sent to prison for multiple years. This, to me, it’s just one of many ways that the legal system is rigged against drug addicts. 

One of the biggest things happening within the drug addiction industry in the US is something called the Florida Shuffle. Essentially, private rehab companies that also operate halfway homes target drug addicts from all around the United States and sell them a pipe dream. They offer them treatment in a 30 day rehab and they market the facility as if it were some all inclusive resort. They advertise things like hot tubs, spas, the ability to use your cell phone, and more. They even pay for the patient’s flight to get to the facility. 

So basically, put yourself in that situation. You are a hopeless drug addict and it is the month of February and you live in New Hampshire or some other cold ass state. Those of us opiate addicts know how much more painful it is being dope sick when it’s 10 degrees outside. 


Maybe you’re dope sick 50% of the time you are miserable. You are not in the right frame of mind to make a life-altering decision. Someone on the phone is sweet talking you and offers to pay for a flight to Florida to a fancy rehab and promises you that when you get out of the rehab, you can stay in an awesome trendy sober living and start a new life. I remember being in rehab in Florida and I already had my living arrangements settle when I got out, but I swear to God, my entire stay at rehab they were pushing this halfway house and they were trying to make it sound like it was the most trendy thing. They even gave it a cool nickname and called it, “halfway” for short. Like, “what are you going to do when you get out, are you going to halfway?” Meanwhile there is nothing cool and trendy about these places. In fact, if you are in one, you are most likely going to keep it on the DL, or you are just going to get through it. That’s how I looked at it. When I was in a sober living, I looked at it as it was something to get me adjusted to sober life. Now, looking back at it in retrospect, do I think it helped at all? I have mixed opinions, but my answer leans towards, “no“, but that’s a whole different post. And I feel it’s a post worth making and I will definitely talk about halfway houses in the future. 


But let’s get back to that phone call from that guy in Florida who’s promising you the Florida getaway of a lifetime. Meanwhile, you’re not thinking straight. You actually think that this person on the other line has your well-being in mind. But they don’t. Your well-being is not even among their top 20 priorities. Their only priority is the money that you are going to make them. And you are going to make them literally thousands. Because guess how much that rehab cost? Anywhere from $15K to $30k. Sometimes even more. Guess how much that halfway house cost? If they can get you to stay for six months, that’s another three grand in their pockets. Oh, and let’s not forget their other urine test racket. They basically make you pee in a cup once a week and they charge the insurance company about $300 for that. So, essentially, you are a piggy-bank to them. And, they are using every manipulation trick in the book. They are bringing up the truth and splicing it with their narrative. They are telling you that so far, your own decisions have led to chaos, so maybe it’s best to let someone else ha for your affairs for a change. For them, this is a great tactic because they have a good point. Unfortunately, just because you are in the mitts of a rough time doesn’t mean you should let someone take advantage of you. Always be wary of people. Never in 1 million years does a stranger across the country want the best for you. The truth is, we live in a capitalist country. So, at any given moment, if complete stranger is being nice to us for seemingly no reason, It’s always a possibility that they have something to gain from us.

Anyway, this is the racket called the Florida shuffle. And basically, the Florida Shuffle isn’t best for your recovery. At that vulnerable moment, running away from it all and starting fresh feels like it’s the best move. But, when decisions are made that compulsively, there’s always something you are not thinking of. There’s always something you’re not considering.

When you are at rock-bottom and you are struggling and your life has caught up to you because of your fuck ups, it feels like the number one thing to do right now is to walk away from the situation you’re in and hit the ‘reset’ button. But, that’s not always the best choice. Granted, sometimes it is. But, we have to consider that different things work for different people. 

The truth is, next to losing a loved one, moving is one of the biggest life stressors. It’s in the top 10. In other words, even if you are a completely normal person who is not recovering from a drug addiction, relocating across the country is one of the most stressful things a human being can endure. Now, let’s think about doing that WHILE recovering from opioid addiction. To me, that sounds like a recipe for failure.

But like I said, every situation is different and we need to address the fact that for some people, going right back to the unhealthy situation you were in before it’s just not an option. And that’s a fair assessment. But there are ways to deal with this that don’t require you to pack up and move across the country. First of all, let’s say you lived in a big house where a bunch of people shared it and everyone was on drugs. Or maybe you rented a room from a homeowner and it was you and your significant other and you were both using. Or let’s say you lived in a studio apartment and right now it’s pretty much barren And there is nothing in it and going back to that apartment is going to make you depressed and want to use instantly. These are all very real situations. And, I would say the best way to handle them is to figure out a way to move back to the general area where you came from, but with modifications. And what I mean by that is call mom move in with your family if possible. Moving in with your family can provide you with structure that you didn’t have in your previous living situation. Maybe moving in with the family is not an option. For me, I fell under this category. In that case, sober living might be the best option. However, why pile onto the stress and go to a sober living more than a thousand miles away? It’s probably best to get a sober living arrangement somewhere near where you used to live. This way, you can learn how to adjust to life in the area where you came from. This way, you are not running from your hometown. You are facing it head on. And, you can wait however long you want, and then at some point you might have the ability to revisit your previous living situation or a different one.

Basically, what this all comes down to, is that a lot of addicts have grandiose plans to move to Florida with the girlfriend or Just pack up and move away thinking that this is going to fix everything, meanwhile all it does is suck up resources. And what I mean by that is, unless you have tens of thousands in the bank, if you just decide to pack up and move tomorrow across the country, chances are you are going to have to get rid of all of your furniture, a bunch of your stuff. If you have a pet, you light even have to get rid of them. And, all of this for what amounted to an impulsive choice that didn’t help you at all. 

And if you feel the need to pack up and move across the country in order to get away from a host of problems you have, at least do this much before making that decision: Google “change plan worksheet” and you will see A worksheet that is like a formatted list. Basically, right every single one of your problems down on that list. And then write down what you want to change. After that, you write down what you need to do to make those changes. And at least at this point, you will have a clear picture of what you are trying to run away from. And then, hopefully you can be honest with yourself and realize that moving away isn’t going to solve any of that. Rather, the only thing that is going to solve any of this is to actually work on the problems.

And, with all of that aside, it’s just unhealthy to make moving across the country a part of your recovery because a lot of times, attached to that are expectations. And I see this all the time. I see people who are unhappy placing huge expectations upon certain things and plans, all of which are temporary. Meanwhile, they are not addressing that inside they are unhappy. Basically, until they address that inner unhappiness, the problem will persist. And I want to see everyone happy. It’s important that we take care of our mental health. And moving or even going on a trip He’s not going to fix chronic problems like drug addiction. For chronic problems, we need chronic solutions.

So, I hope this makes sense to you guys. Basically, in recovery, we are dealing with some heavy issues. And simply moving across the country is not going to solve the issue. We might be looking forward to the drive over there. We might be looking forward to trying some new food. We might be looking forward to the sunshine. And, in those cases, I say maybe go for a road trip somewhere far away to clear your head or maybe take a day trip to a state park and get away from everything temporarily. Sometimes, we just need a reset like that.

After that experience I was so scared to stop doing them. They were my life line to feeling normal and my lifeline to being happy. I knew I had to get off them but I was so scared my life would be turned upside down. I didn’t want to go to rehab cause I was afraid would get addicted on Suboxone or methadone, leading to a lifetime of dependency. I turned to this sub reddit and learned about tapering. From there I decided to cut down my consumption so I could just feel normal at first. Within the first two days I was able to cut down to 5 pills a day. I was going through constant mild withdraw (cold sweats, restless legs, uneasiness, etc). Every morning when I woke up I was withdrawing bad and it sucked. I was drenched in sweat and my legs were crawling. I kept pushing through withdraws as long as I could, eventually leading to only taking a quarter pill a day. After going through constant withdraw for around a week and a half, I woke up one morning and all the pain was gone. It was crazy & I couldn’t believe it. I eventually started to withdraw a little mid day, but I only took maybe 1/10th of a pill to feel better. The day after that I was no longer dependent on them. My Appetite came back and also found myself laughing again. After being in a dark spot for so long, the light at the end of the tunnel was finally upon me. 

One thing I always think back on, is that I thought it would never end. I thought that my life was going to be so grey without taking something. I’m here to tell you that if you taper and take the bare minimum  every time, withdraws will end very soon. It took me 25 pills in a week and a half to come off a 10 a day habit for close to a year. Fast forward 3 months and I just closed on my third Airbnb property. I have energy, I’m happy, and I found purpose again. 

To everyone reading this that’s withdrawing, it will get better. I was you 3 months ago! You know this needs to stop but your scared. Don’t be scared. Face this demon face to face and give the bare minimum. Do not get high! Feel better! Throw on some three days grace and ride it out as long as you can haha. I love you all, if anyone needs help please contact me. There is a way out…

Well right before I move into my first apartment, I get illegally fired by my shitty job, after I called them out for shorting me hours while paying me under the table.

Slamming fentalogue dope every single day. I've gotten a gun pointed at my face multiple times this year, by multiple people. But several times this year by someone I live with.

This gave me the bright idea to use hydro’s because my addiction convinced me Covid mixed with withdrawl could kill me.

Remember in the late 90s, early 00s when oxycontin was big and every doctor was prescribing long acting opiates? Ever wonder how that happened? Well, the big pharma companies paid for studies to be done saying that these opiate meds weren't nearly as addictive as other opiates, even know they knew that wasn't true. They fed doctors information from the research they paid for and bribed them with lunches and trips to prescribe their new ""less addictive"" opiates. Why? Anybody remember the pictures of American troops guarding opium poppy fields in Afghanistan? That was because the Taliban wanted to burn those fields. Gee, I wonder where all the raw materials for the drugs pharma was pushing came from? 

Anyway, pharma literally admitted to knowingly causing the opiate epidemic. They actually were just fined millions for it.

So we get a bag. Put it in our arms…we were shooting coke on the reg before the fent…and then one time turns into 2, into 5, into 10, into every day for 14 months. Both of us had good enough jobs and kind friends and family who lent us money when we were low to support our $700+ a week habit. Then, one of my partners best friends ODs. We watched them carry the body out of the house. Cried…but inside I felt nothing still. Crazy how that shit makes you feel so cold. But I guess that’s what we were after. Struggled with depression, anxiety, add/adhd, bi polar, and borderline, for decades. Tried pills, tried tms, tried therapy. Nothing touches the sadness. Except fent. That shit makes you feel nothing. Really nothing. I didn’t give a damn about anything but getting high anymore. Didn’t care who I had to beg, borrow, or steal from to get what I needed. One night, my girl comes over for her bday, we are drinking, partying. She begs me to put a shot in her arm. Relentless, she keeps asking, so I oblige. 5 min later she hits the floor, no pulse, not breathing, turns blue. Chest compressions and mouth to mouth breathing keep her alive until the paramedics narcan her back to life. Close fucking call. Still kept using after that but now I can barely hit a vein, (bad veins to begin with) I’m taking hours to get high sometimes. Sometimes, I would just give up and push down just to keep off sick. Slowly falling into more and more debt, family and friends pissed off at us for misusing our money (while having no idea what we were spending it on). I did my last dose the day before thanksgiving, spent thanksgiving with my boyfriends family in the first 24 hours of detox. Then day 3 hit. I never get past day 3. This time… instead of using I get help. I call my family tell them the truth and get a hotel and then an Airbnb with a hot tub and fire place to keep up that body temp. Unlimited hot water would save my ass from relapse. My sister spent her entire savings flying up to take care of me and the cats and dogs. She took me to the doc, got some blood work done (HIV, STI’s, thyroid and other stuff) got my prescriptions took me to NA and nursed me thru the next few days. So here I am now. Sitting at 2 weeks. The insomnia is still bad, restless legs and general anxiety and depression are in full swing. But I feel 70% better right now.

I wanted to briefly share an opportunity for anyone who is interested: If you are 18 or older and in recovery from opiate (or any other substance) use, we'd love if you considered joining our research initiative, the International Quit & Recovery Registry (IQRR).

The IQRR is a part of Virginia Tech and is IRB-approved. It's aimed at understanding recovery from addiction. Membership is free and anonymous, and members can complete compensated online surveys about their recovery experience. Each survey pays $5.00-$10.00 depending on the length of time and payments are made through PayPal. (There is no minimum commitment required to be or remain a member.) We also have additional resource lists, our published journal articles available to read, staff blog posts, and more.

A great deal of research has been done on understanding addiction and developing more effective treatments, but little has been directed towards people who are in recovery and understanding their experience. We believe that recovery is an inclusive process and we know it may not always be linear - we welcome you to register and participate regardless of whether or not you are currently using any substance.

You can visit our website at [www.quitandrecovery.org](https://www.quitandrecovery.org), and if you are interested, you can register at [https://members.quitandrecovery.org/register/](https://members.quitandrecovery.org/register/)

Your story is invaluable, and it has tremendous power to help other people. We appreciate your reading and please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.

Love y'all.,"The first four days are the worst. You're not going to sleep, you're going to be cranky and lethargic. Also, some muscle soreness, and a bit of dissociation. Some have uncontrollable bowel movements, and/or nausea, etc.

This period of time is not fun, and you're going to have to pay the piper. It is what it is. Are you strong enough to get through it? Yes, you are - however, you have to actually want to get clean.

Have you ever been in the very early stages of w/d, because you can't get ahold of your dealer, and then he/she calls/texts you to come on, and then magically your w/d's subside, because you know you're going to be ok? I've never fully understood the mental mechanism behind that, but I do think it's primal. THAT is what you're going up against, so YOU are going to have to go deep within yourself to ask what it is that you really want.

Much of this is willpower, and honestly, I think it's almost Darwinian to a certain degree. Only those possessing strong willpower will get through it, and I truly hope you don't miss the boat. That sounds callous, but it is what it is.

Even after the overdose deaths of a few of my friends and a member of my family, I continued to use for over a year. People dropping all around me wasn't even enough to shake it at the time. Getting clean is a personal fucking choice. You will either get clean, or you won't. You will either make an effort to start truly living, or continue dying in a fleeting chemical-induced fever.

I decided that never having any money despite having a decent job, not having a sex drive, not giving a shit about seeing my friends, not being able to take a shit for days, and not being able to function without having a bag of drugs somewhere on me was enough.

This all sounds angry and emotional, and I suppose it is. We're all so much stronger than we think we are, but also weaker than we might acknowledge, at first. Knowing your weaknesses, triggers, understanding them, writing them down, journaling your experiences, will lead you to victory.

I have been using fentanyl and fake 30s/fent pills for a large part of the pandemic, have various excuses and am ashamed I ever went back (I had been clean for a few years and just recently started a good job after being unemployed for a long time). Because I wanted to be sure I kept my new job and just generally didn't want to be a secretive, reclusive, sweaty piece of shit anymore, I researched for weeks, called insurance, 211, etc. to find a suboxone doctor.

I was given enough for a week, but the provider was not in my network so insurance will not refill the prescription.

Does anyone know of a way to quickly get prescribed suboxones, OR, a way to lower my dosage (two 8 mgs is way too high, but now I'm used to it) in order to stretch out the few I have left until I can find a solution? I've been told using an opiate at a low dose then going back to subs the next day at a much lower dose will lower your tolerance, but that seems like a veryyyyy risky situation, though I'm determined enough if I get confirmation it will work to bring my tolerance down. I'm willing to try anything - I just want to be a better human already, do it the right way, and not be tied to any medication physically! So, my end goal is to be on the lowest dose to absolutely nothing --- but ANY help getting there or getting suboxone doctors in CT in the meantime while I figure this out is SO APPRECIATED.

I've done a search but didn't find any specific posts and most are quite old.

I've personally found the sauna to be very helpful with post acute withdrawals and in the past with tapering too, and have been going a lot. The heat seems to eliminate the cold feelings, any chills, the aching bones & muscles quickly, even seems to help with depression & anxiety and it lasts a while after. The social aspect is also nice, and it seems to really reduce stress and help with relaxation, anxiety and sleep if done late in the evening.

There seems to be some science possibly backing it up; sauna use apparently stimulates kappa-opioid receptors (what dynorphin and salvia work on). The kappa stimulation causes dysphoria and itchiness amongst other things, and apparently leads to an increase in mu-opioid receptors. So in theory that process should facilitate recovery? It certainly feels like that happens to me, I get the itchiness after a while, pain is reduced and it feels at least as relieving and effective as taking 60-90mg of codeine to me, more effective than the popular recovery supplements I've tried.

If you haven't tried it and are struggling with post acute withdrawals/cold/pain/insomnia or are tapering I would recommend giving it a go and sharing your thoughts.

Edit: make sure to stay hydrated. Consider electrolytes. I wouldn't recommend going in while having acute withdrawals due to the intensity, sweat, heart rate, blood pressure and the dehydration. Also any comfort meds you might be on. Clonidine would be risky due to low blood pressure, benzos and gabapentinoids too due to risk of falling.",14,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6083075}"

I posted on here a while ago and a couple of people reached out to me which I will be eternally grateful for 🙏

I'm now 10 days clean, and I just wanted to share my story a little, maybe it'll help someone, maybe it won't. But it's worth a go?

So I was hooked on Nurofen+ for about 10 years. I met someone who I want to spend the rest of my life with but with my financial issues (7k debt and increasing by the day) I was at rock bottom and didn't feel right him not knowing.

So I told him, I gave him control of my tablets, then I went home (we don't live together and he's 3 hours away). Then the HELL started.

I went cold turkey essentially, I loaded up on vitamins (Vit C, D, iron, herbal sleeping tablets (diphenhydramine hydrochloride)). Let me tell you. There is no quick solution to coming off a codeine addiction. But the first step, is realising you have a problem, and you're willing to crack the psychological hold. The psychological part IS NOT EASY. But it's very do-able. 

Herbal sleeping pills make RLS worse, IMO. It's not fun. But by starting taking iron, it alleviates the effects. So on the hourly basis, I was having a bath, keeping it run, filling a hot water bottle and placing it wherever it hurt, even if it burnt, and taking iron tablets in the morning and at night (not always recommended but i've found out i'm anemic so check first). 

The baths and HWBs really really helped me. Scrap the first 3 days, you won't sleep. Sack those days off. It's hell, i'm not gonna lie to you. 

By day 4 and 5, I was starting to sleep through the night, I was getting energy in leaps and bounds, and i was only buying toilet roll for the shits. 

If you can get through the first couple of days and just accept that you're not gonna sleep, then you can power through.

The last thing I did, was I told people I had a problem, but that i've cracked it, and i'm not going back. The amount of support was incredible. I told my father who's a paramedic, so he examined me too and told me I was lucky, but after 2 hours of crying and cuddles, the situation was accepted and he's now my strongest ally in the fight against my opiate addiction. I told my place of work who told me its very common and have been very supportive, but approach with caution if you're not sure. My manager is one of my best friends so I had an easier time with it. If you're unsure in any capacity, DON'T do it. 

I hope this helps, you can always DM me if you feel better that way. 

I'm no expert in any way, but I put my body through shock its never been through before and I sat in A&E for 9 hours to then leave and just deal with it on my own. Healthcare professionals in the UK don't really know what to do with you tbh, my GP just told me I was brave. 😕 Nothing else.

My advice is to load up with vitamins, iron, get a hot water bottle, get used to baths and get some muscle soak, that stuff is MAGIC. 

I hope you're doing OK out there, you can do anything you put your mind to, just have faith 🙏",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41755247}"

I know withdrawal is unimaginable hell I’ve been through it some time ago - fentanyl is absolutely insidious. But that alone gives me some reassurance that I could do it just once and not slip back into addiction due to how much I fear WDs. Just some thoughts, more than likely not going to go out of my way to find new plugs but I’ve been entertaining the idea for some time now and I feel guilty just thinking about it. But I can’t really get it out of my mind. Not sure what to do :-( 

Also using it once wouldn’t put me in WDs again right?

This is just as much therapeutic for me to write  as it is to feel comfort from people. Even if no one responds or reads this book report, it helps for me to write it. 

So I'm on day 3 of being off oxy. I was using around 75-100mg a day for about 4 months straight. Maybe a few days off but not many.  I've been using other opiates like hydrocodone,  tramadol,  and tapentadol for 3 years. Oxycontin OC formula came into the mix about a year ago but really took hold 3-5 months ago. I was always a casual user of pain meds for recreation and I guess you could say I was a functioning user. I'd use for 3-4 days then stop for weeks.  Even when I started using more regularly it didn't effect my life. But over the last 2 months I noticed that I would have to plan my dosage and re-up on meds more closely. 

Then I had my first taste of withdrawals about 6 weeks ago! Wow! Needless to say I took more oxy to get out of that feeling after 1 day! Well after a lot of research on here on how to detox or taper, and what comfort meds to take, I took the plunge! I probably did it wrong by not tapering but I want to quit now, not 6 weeks from now after a proper taper.  

So Sunday I took 100mg of oxy OC throughout the day. Monday wasn't bad and I worked as planned, Monday evening got a little rough. Withdrawal symptoms kicked in full force late Monday night around midnight. I have a wife and twin boys that are 4 so I knew this would be a challenge. On top of withdrawing I'm sick with a cold (probably has to do with my drug use and stopping).
My wife is only aware that I'm prescribed hydrocodone ,tramadol, and gabapentin. So being sick gives me a reason to withdrawal and not have to explain myself . Hey I'm just sick,  wink wink.

Anyway Tuesday is horrendous, I barely leave my bed until around 4 when they get home from pre school. I've been taking gabapentin,  motrin, and clonodine, and xanax. (Xanax only at night to sleep) . But none of these seem to help much. Around 7 we get the kids ready for bed and I go to my bed (wife sleeping in spare bedroom cause I'm sick) I pass out at 8ish but thrash around alot  throughout the night till one of the twins comes in at 5am. He sleeps with me till 7 when my wife nicely get the boys ready for school without my help. I fall back asleep at 7 after taking a xanax and sleep all the way to 1130am. I force my self up take more comfort meds ( gaba,  clonodine ) take a hot bath, and now feeling much better. It's now 130pm as I sit in bed pretty relaxed. 

Have I cleared the worst of it?  Can't be past the worst right? I'm only 3 days in. I mean I feel like shit but nothing like I did Tuesday all day. I mean I basically cold turkey'd it after Sunday. No taper at all. I thought I would be suffering hard like I did Tuesday for at least another 3 or 4 days.  Am I just tricking myself or are the comfort meds helping? 
 
Anyway I'm on day 3. I can't fast forward, I can only press play.  Any tips or suggestions are very appreciated, especially since this is my first time quitting , or going through withdrawal.

This post is for anyone who may one day find it through the search bar or google. My taper story.,"Tramadol is a beast to withdraw and people don’t know that because they did stronger opiates such as heroin, fent, oxy, etc. This leads people to misinform others on the withdrawal saying “it’s not half as bad, just suck it up and go through it, it’s baby withdrawal etc.” 

ANYONE who has been addicted to tramadol for longer than 2-3 years will tell you quitting is not a joke just because the drug isn’t a strong opiate. The withdrawal is 80% antidepressant SNRI withdrawal which as people may know or not, is agonizing physically and psychologically.

After 6 years of taking 300mg daily 150 wake 150 at lunch, and multiple attempts atleast three where I failed and realized it is going to be hell, I decided this year to taper. I started in May dropping from 300 to 200 to start off with a decent lower dose that won’t cause me to withdraw much. Divided into two 100mg doses. 

Then what happened is I adjusted to that dose and at about 3 weeks later I dropped to 90 and 90 (180). Then went 85 and 85 (170). Then I dropped to 80 and 80 (160) dropping 10mg every 3 weeks. Repeated this pattern until 5mg and 5mg! All the way to today, I have successfully in 6 months through a very SLOW taper, jumped for the first time in my life and feel somewhat normal and I’m on Day 8. I can work and I deliver mail and it’s a pretty serious, heavy time right now for us with holidays and I’m able to do it with little problem other than low appetite pretty spaced out and low motivation.

To be honest I kinda rushed the last bit of the taper. Cutting an 8 mg strips was so getting hard to do accurately… I was getting v frustrated trying to dose so I just decided to see how long I could go without dosing.

I have a **TL;DR** at the bottom. Also, for those who don't know what Kratom is: It's a plant powder that contains about 1% of a potent alkaloid/opiate -

I'm 21 with a long history of drug abuse. Was in Rehab for opiate dependency and alcohol addiction once. After getting out my life had its ups and downs. I got addicted to heroin for a short time and managed to quit by myself without anyone even noticing I was taking heroin at the time. However, this habit of hiding my addiction as well as recovery is now becoming a huge issue.

2021 has been the worst year of my life. It started decently ok as I was able to make good changes to my life. Do more sports, lose weight, fewer drugs. But then my oldest friend who was a recovering opiate addict died of an overdose. From there it went downhill. I struggled to find the motivation to keep up good habits. And things got worse but remained at least manageable. 

However, with my deteriorating mental state university got harder and harder. I failed at things that previously came relatively easy to me. Started drinking more, and smoking more weed. Before summer break I had one last exam that could decide whether I am able to stay at the university or fail, get kicked and never become what I've aspired to be since I was 13 (a psychotherapist). 4 days before the exam my brother called me and told me that my mother, who had been in the hospital due to cancer for the last 2 months would probably die soon. He said that according to the doctor she may well be dead before I get to write the exam. I live in the Netherlands and my family was in Germany, so I had to make a decision whether I wanna see my abusive alcoholic mother one more time or write the exam. I chose the latter but the stress of the exam being so important and my mother potentially dying while I was still in NL was unbearable. I started studying all through the day and every evening I would just get stoned and absolutely wasted.

I actually passed the exam and got to see my mother 2 more times before she died, but the bad habits stuck. I was back in Germany for the summer and spend a lot of time drinking alone, smoking weed and happened to find a source for opium. Naturally, I took way too much all throughout summer got opiate-dependent but had to go back to the Netherlands when university started again. I could not get proper treatment as that would've meant to basically quit university for a semester. So I started taking kratom with the intention of using it as a substation I can slowly taper down my opiate dependency. However, more and more shit kept happening. My drug-fueled summer break caused my ADHD to become much worse. I could hardly study anymore. So I didn't really manage to quit Kratom. 

Over the last months, I sometimes tried to quit and sometimes I took more because awful stuff kept happening. I wake up every morning feeling like shit until I take some Kratom. This has been going on for over 4 months and I don't know how to stop. I managed to quit drinking by myself. And I believe I will be able to quit smoking too much weed by myself. But I don't know how to quit Kratom. Going to Rehab is not an option for me as that would basically mean giving up on university. Even if that wasn't an issue I feel so ashamed of being addicted to opiates AGAIN. Not a single person knows I'm addicted to Kratom. And I don't have the guts to tell them. Especially since it's been 4 fucking months. 

Any tips on how I can quit Kratom by myself? I don't think I will be able to tell others about it (but I try). I also desperately want to get into psychotherapy, however, this is not an option while I'm actively addicted to something. I have an appointment with a Dutch addiction treatment organisation and I will try to tell them about my Kratom use, but I don't think I will be able to. My fear of telling anyone is incredibly irrational but knowing that doesn't really help me conquer it. I need something like a headstart or a contingency plan in case I'm not able to tell them. 

**TL;DR**

I have a long history of drug abuse, 2021 was shit and I've been addicted to Kratom for over 4 months. How do I quit without telling anyone?  I will have to slowly reduce the amounts I take as quitting cold turkey is not an option but even that feels borderline impossible right now. I take any advice that might help me.

Without going into the long wind about my addiction, I’ll keep it light. Started oxy early 20’s, got off twice with subs easy. Started again after my 2nd spinal nerve surgery and for some reason jumped from them to H but the H has been street fent dope. Found out by going into PAWS really bad 2 years ago even after 36 hours of nothing before subs. Jumped back to the H. Now not only do I need to get clean, but I want to. And I only have a week and 2 days until I’ll be leaving for Mexico. I need to find a way. Methadone is a possible option. I can go as soon as 6pm tomorrow. Or this Bernese method I have heard has me curious BUT I’m confused. People are saying they take small amounts of sub and NOT get paws? How?  Literally was just 40 hours clean off the dope, cut a TINY corner of sub off (literally the size of a pin head or smaller) and 10 mins later I was being thrown into paws. I took half a bag (I get dimes) and it helped take the edge off and felt like I was regular acute wd’s again. Took the other half a couple hours later and then half of another and hour after that to feel kore comfortable. Which is still less then I would normally use. Normally from 6am to 10pm I do about 7-9 dime bags of dope. I don’t know what grams it would be. So is that normal in the Bernese method? Do I dose the same sub again 12 hours after my last? Or does there have to be time after taking dope to take the next peice of sub? Or is this not working for me? Thanks . I just want my life back. I can’t lose my family.

It's a type of reservation, I've slowly developed over the years since my last day of everyday using, and it's something I'd like to combat, dissect, and hear other's opinions on.

When it came to using opiates, I can remember the most predominant thing being that money, was always, the issue, always was and always will be for me when it comes to opiates.

But what happens if I start making a lot of money, (a huge what if I know), what would be the real incentive to not use?  When I say a lot I mean, anything beyond a minimum wage job which I had the entire time using which I'm surprised funded my habit for as long as it did.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50136024}"

The RLS, no sleep, hot and cold sweats, severe back pain was unbelievably relentless. A trip to my GP and A&E were useless and it was then that I realised that opiate use in the UK is not a talked about subject where I am and that I was completely on my own with this. My GP even said all my muscles have just seized and I have to ride it out. The shits will pass, and the fever will go eventually. In truth, she had absolutely no fucking idea what to do with me and referred me to someone else as their problem. 

If you're struggling, I recommend a hot bath with muscle soak, a hot water bottle (preferably the big ones) and keep it filled with HOT water!! And lots and lots and lots of orange juice and ibuprofen. Its sorted me out quicker than I thought.
I slept like a baby last night, I only woke up once with RLS in my legs and arms, but slept the rest of the way through. Currently I'm only dealing with hot and cold sweats but that's a breeze compared to the state I was in yesterday. 

I've used for almost 10 years, after 2 days of suffering, I feel rejuvenated and clear minded. If nothing else, get a hot water bottle and orange juice and just drink that like its your last drink. You will feel so much better. 

I've also been taking herbal sleeping tablets, non addictive, and they've really helped take the edge off when going to sleep. But they don't work for everyone. I read someone say avoid diphenhydramine hydrochloride but to be honest, they've really helped me. I've switched from them to nytol and I slept really well.

I NEVER thought I'd be able to get off opiates and who knew I had the remedies in my cupboards. 

You can do this, I'm only on day THREE!! And I feel amazing. The pain people mention is worth it, keep going, take it minute by minute if you have to. But tell yourself you're NOT in pain, you DON'T need another tablet or dose and repeat it until you start to feel convinced.

I'm currently moving forward with almost 10k of debt and that's just credit cards. But I was spending approx £600 a month, if not more on codeine products. Its not worth it. 

GET YOUR FUCKING LIFE BACK. A few days of hell is nothing to how you will feel after. There is no excuse. 

If I can do it, you fucking can!! And I was the worst for coming up with reasons not to, the worst, most pathetic reasons. Enough is enough, don't be another user. Whether you're on codeine or heroin or whatever, the withdrawals won't and don't last forever.

I was also abusing diphenhydramine, just for sleeping but was taking a lot some nights as I developed tolerance of course. 

Last Wed night at the height of my withdrawal symptoms from codeine I had unbelievable restlessness. Thinking it would help I took a ton of nytol, Jesus what a mistake. Symptoms 1000 times worse, thought I was going to go crazy. Thankfully put 2 and 2 together and realised it was the nytol, then did some research and couldn’t believe what I read about diphenhydramine withdrawal - was on it about 20yrs too. 

So, long story short, hardly any sleep, itching like crazy and now today feeling like I have a bloody elephant sitting on my chest, the world’s gone a bit dark and anxiety has gone sky high. I’m sticking to it, just about, although had more than a few wobbles this morning. I’m exercising to some degree every day, eating really well and working too.

We grew up in a small house, shared a bed together. He started doing drugs at 15 and wasted most of his life hitting rock bottom over and over. I have watched him lose everything so many times now…and yet it’s never enough. Then he finally stayed sober for 2 years. He got a job as a medical tech in a hospital, got into nursing school, and I was so proud of him. I really thought this would be the turning point for him. Then, I got the news that he relapsed and has been using for the last month. He got suspended from nursing school and is in a bad place. I finally was able to get a hold of him on the phone yesterday and I just don’t have a good feeling. He doesn’t feel confident in himself to stay sober, he won’t go to rehab, and just thinks he needs to get a back on his workout routine (which is beneficial but won’t keep him sober).  

I really cannot watch him lose everything again. He finally built a life for himself. I don’t know what else I can do beyond talking to him. He lives in a different state right now. Any advice is appreciated.

my brain is like “why should i stay sober?” my family and friends all think i’m sober now, so me using isn’t hurting them now, bc they don’t know so they can’t worry about me.. when i first got clean i had broken down and told them. now only 2 close friends know and i talk with them about it. one of em being an ex-meth addict. the strories he’s told me makes me not want to have to go through all that pain and darkness. it’s like it’s just pain either way. 

i can use and feel pain in a long time, or get clean and feel the pain for a long time, before idk maybe eventually feeling better? how long do i have to walk around depressed and apathetic tho? can do any other drugs and even those barely give me enjoyment. all i want is heroin.

i haven’t even hit WD yet. got a bit left. i could order more any time and have it in 3 days, really really good shit too. st8 powdered heaven.
