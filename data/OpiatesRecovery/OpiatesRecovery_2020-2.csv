finished the last of my heroin not too long ago. the cravings are already kicking in. 

fuck. *fuckfuckfuckfuck*

no easy way out. stuck in my broken down car with, like, 35 cents to my name. idk how i've managed to completely decimate my life YET A-FUCKING-GAIN and i feel so ashamed and sad and angry and helpless and sad. so, so, so sad.

thankfully i broke down at my gym, so i can shower and use the bathroom and be indoors at night, 'cause there ain't no way in hell i'm going to be able to sleep tonight....

yes, the physical part of withdrawal fucking sucks but the mental bullshit... the crippling depression and self-pity and the OVERWHELMING desire to use *just one last time* is what does me in every time...

my dad is thankfully coming out to hopefully fix my little car tomorrow... at least he hasn't totally written off his junkie daughter...

guys, please, i implore you to tell me how awful heroin is and how i'm better without it... i know that shit to be true already, but god damn, i need to hear it from other people, please...

Then I had surgery in November and took some liberties with my norcos, but still was fairly responsible with them all things considered. Until I ran out at which point I lasted a week before I started buying oxy. And just as always, it starts out as harmless fun and you think this time will be different because hey I’m able to only take it a couple times a week.

Anyway, I’ve tried to kick cold the last 2 weeks or so since I’m not in that deep yet so the withdrawals should be very tolerable relative to 3 years of heavy fent use withdrawal that I went through last year. But I couldn’t even do that, I get to 36-48hrs and don’t feel terrible but then cave in bc I guess I justify that as not needing to quit just yet. Now I’ve got subutex and I’m planning on doing a 5-7 day taper, starting at as low of a dose as possible. Used my last oxy last night at 8pm so now just waiting until I can take my first sub.

I've used oxy (10/15/30mg) w.e I could find the past 5 years. Tried getting off handful of times by myself with subs.. but always ended relapsing like a dumbass..
Near the end of 5 year of bullshitting and wasting precious time/life... I ended switching to H.. or what I thought was H.. due to financial reasons.. 
After using that got about 3month, I had finally broke down and got help. 
Another long story short. My first rehab visit was good and bad.. the withdrawal I've exp was not the same as oxy.. vomiting, feeling dehydrated constantly.. and even getting sent to the hospital from the rehab cause I was supposedly hallucinating. just overall bad experience (borderline medical malpractice type experience too) 
Anyways. After 15/16 days in of rehab (4days In hospital then back to rehab for 2 more days) till I said fuk it and got out against facility advise..
After coming home and trying to stay clean.. by this time I had no huge physical withdrawal.. just  minor discomfort and brain feeling lost and confused all the time.. I just felt too uncomfortable and scared I would never feel the same, after a week back home.. I relapsed... I've made many bad life choices.. clearly.. but never have I regretted a bad decision as I have now for relapsing after a rehab visit.. 
Anyways.. I'm deadly afraid of the withdrawals that I went thru at rehab and know I'm going to have to face it again.. no longer have insurance.. so no option for rehab.. 
My hypothetical question:
if.. a big if.. I were able to get some oxy.. and switched to using oxy to get off H, most likely fent and other crap mixtures. Would that work? And if that did work out and manage to stay off H/fent/street cap bullshits for a good week or 2.. I'm assuming my withdrawals would be much less severe? (Withdrawal from oxy compared to H/fent)
In my experience, I've never puked stomach acid (yellow vile) crap from getting off oxy.. I've only experienced that from my rehab visit coming off fent/mdma/benzos (the stuff I was getting had those 3 mixtures) which made my withdrawal at rehab that much worse.. 
I NEED ADVICE.. any support i could get... I'd really really truly appreciate it..
I would also like to ask other questions/explain more in detail of my exp thru phone to gain the most accurate advice. 
If anyone was willing to hear me out and offer some advice by conversation thru phone call (I dont check reddit often, and find talking on the phone is much easier and quicker to explain than having to text/chat/mail back and forth) I'd be very grateful.. please feel free to PM me.. any and all advice and words of wisdom would be much appreciated.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. It’s my first time. 

I’m stuck. I’ve been in and out of recovery for almost 3 years. This time, I’ve been using for almost 3 months. And withdraw is the worst. I don’t remember it being this horrible. Even taking subs I can’t get through it. No insurance so I can’t go into detox somewhere. The drugs I’m doing are Baltimore caps of dope, white powder. And I’m at the point where I’m going to lose my apartment, car, and my relationship. No matter how many times I swear I’m not gonna pick up, I do. I can’t believe I let myself get to this point again. I feel hopeless. I know once I get past the withdraw, I need to go to meetings everyday. And get involved again. I just can’t figure out how to get over the 5 days of hell. I just need some advice. Or motivation. Anything... like I said I tried subs that I bought off the street. And they literally did nothing to help the sickness. And that scares the shit out of me. What do I do now. I’ve been considering getting on methadone but I don’t wanna be stuck on that.

The other is phenobarbital. It is a long acting barbiturate, and I don't even know what they use it for nowdays. It is potent and will keep you asleep all night long.  It is mildly addictive (but not nearly as bad as something like benzos) and is also a controlled substance - schedule IV.

I just turned 43, I have $70,000 worth of student loans I can’t pay, a shitty low wage job that was supposed to be a foot in the door (but here I am 3 years later not even making enough to pay mortgage and bills), and my wife was just laid off. 

FUN!

I am struggling to wrap my brain around what I am supposed to do here. I feel like a steak that someone put in their freezer 20 years ago and now it’s long past it’s expiry date. Wasn’t I supposed to die of an overdose by the time I was 23? 

At least when I was loaded I only had one problem: getting heroin. Now it’s fucking fixed interest mortgage payments, vehicle maintenance, and lying to my kids that if they study and work hard they can get ahead and be happy. 

So, I’m supposed to say how I’m so grateful I’m not loaded today, but fuck am I? Fuck, honestly I wish I was. I wish I didn’t have to think or feel right now. I wish this dripping sweat under my arms, cold spike of panic in my brain, and overwhelming depression was gone in a wave of euphoric bliss. 

Damn near 20 years off the smack, and a whopping 3 months off the subs, life is teaming up with PAWS to kick my ass all over the map today. I found myself mumbling to myself in front of other people this morning and I worry my mask of sanity is slipping.

I’m a writer and journalist in a small town where all the news is now owned by right-wing corporations and only hire young fresh-faced students... but I can’t move to a bigger city as I have split custody of my 13 year-old son. 

I was born into poverty, it’s all I’ve known. I went back to school to better myself and find a career I could advance in, only to find out that no one wanted to hire a 29 year-old with a criminal record.

Ok. Self pity poison out of the way. What are my options- Talk to my boss and tell him it’s not working out? Keep looking for another less-shitty paying job? It’s been years since I was paid to write anything, have I lost it? Should I be grateful and shut the hell up? 

Goddamn I want to get loaded and forget everything... but it’ll just be there tomorrow when I’m done throwing up. So I guess it’s “put one fucking foot in front of another” and try to stay positive.

2020-02-27 01:42:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/fa81km/the_opiate_story/,The Opiate Story,"Think about the first time you tried opiates. It was probably the most innocent thing. Maybe you had a surgery and wanted to see how it felt or just liked how it felt. You get that warm and fuzzy feeling like nothing could be better. 

Next thing you know you're asking a friend who sells you a couple. You take them on and off because it feels good. You probably forgot about your childhood trauma or the anxiety and depression you used to have. All you know is that this pill is making everything so much better. You start spending more money and getting them more often.

Now people might be warning you that you're going down a bad path. You don't believe them because you have it all under control. People start saying things, like ""this shit doesn't discriminate, be careful"". Oh but you have it all under control, addiction could never happen to me. I have a good life, good job, the perfect fiance, nah that would never happen.

Fast forward maybe a year, now you're taking triple of what you started with. It was on and off but you accidentally went on a binge. Maybe things have been tough at work or in your personal life. So this binge lasts maybe 4 days. You get minor withdrawals but it's no big deal right? Now you know that you can go this many days without feeling terrible. So then you push it a little further and instead of 4 days now it's a week and a half maybe two.

At this point, you feel like absolute dog shit. You go back to the plug and get some Suboxone or subutex. You start taking it for the withdrawals. Soon you find yourself dependent on the subs. You're taking them every day and at a pretty high dose because you still want to feel relaxed.

Days turn to weeks, weeks turns to months, and before you know it you've been taking Suboxone for a year. Of course inbetween you're dabbling with the oxy or opiate of choice.

A year on Suboxone now and all those childhood traumas, the anxiety, the depression, it's all coming to light. You've lost motivation in anything and everything. You don't enjoy the things you used to. You're sitting back watching life pass you by thinking you have no purpose in life.

One day, you get sick of feeling like you're wasting your life. So you decide to stop taking Suboxone, however, you have no idea what you're doing or how to do it. You just know that you need to stop so you quit cold turkey.

Each day that goes by you feel worse and worse. You keep telling yourself that tomorrow will be better. Eventually you've gone a few weeks and tomorrow hasn't came. You've tried anything and everything to help with withdrawals.

That's when it really hits you... Why did I do this to myself. Why did I let myself get to this point. HOW did I get to this point?! This could NEVER happen to me!! 

But yet you're sitting there sick... Your new truck has been reposessed...You're a month behind on your mortgage.. and all you can do is sit there praying you feel better tomorrow... When will tomorrow come?

Please, if anyone is on here reading this, please, I'm literally begging you to think twice before you dive into this terrible world of opiates. It's not worth all that is to follow. Go smoke weed or something if you want to get high and relax. This path of opiates is one of disaster and heartache. You will lose personal belongings, money, your friends, your family, and most of all yourself. It's not worth it.

Me and my wife started a farm in the middle of fucking no where. During the planning stage we ran into a lot of different road blocks. At first me and my friend were going to start and run the farm, but we didn’t have enough money to pay him so I was stuck knowing I couldn’t turn land into farm by myself.  

Enter my now wife who decided that we should move up our wedding we were planning, get eloped, and start the farm together. I thought this was a great idea but I had some reservations. I come from a labor background and know how brutal some work is. I stressed to her that this was a concern of mine... like beyond stressed... we even had a conversation with our therapist about it. She convinced me that she was into it and that we should start the process. So we eloped and started building this farm.

The building process was brutal. Lots of land clearing and trying to operate a tractor being a total rookie. But we did it! We got our cover crop down before winter and moved into our house at the start of the new year. I was so fucking happy. Like tears of joy happy on multiple occasions. Our hard work was taking shape. 

When we moved into our house something changed in my wife. She would constantly complain about everything. Somethings were warranted but a lot of it was just maniacal complaining . The weather has been shit since we moved in. It’s rained more days than it hasn’t and our house sits on like 3 acres of mud as we await our grass to come up. We have a large dog who likes to go outside so the house ends up muddy and dirty. She’s developed this ocd like obsession with cleaning. Looking back on it, it was a sign that I didn’t pick up on.

Did I mention how far out in the middle of nowhere we are? We have 300 acres of wooded land and we don’t have any neighbors. We are 2.5 hours away from friends and family that we’ve left, but we knew all of this going in. We’ve actually had quite a few guests who have came through in our short time here. We are isolated but not stranded or anything. Our life is way different here than from the one we left behind. We cook all our meals and spend the whole day with each other. I made a resolution to stop frequently drinking but my wife claims she needs it and continued to have a couple glasses of wine a night. Another sign I didn’t pick up on but I come from a family of drinkers and just thought it’s normal behavior. 

Sex has been weird since coming off my habit. I’m so sensitive still after 11 months and can tell I’m disappointing her. The first time I detoxed I had sensitivity issues but they went away within a month. I don’t get it and it’s really embarrassing so I’m rarely in the mood. A few weeks ago she complained about our sex life and I tried to be better. This past week she has turned me down because she’s not in the mood on separate occasions. It’s like she’s repulsed by me. 

Sunday she told me she was unhappy for all the reasons listed above. I don’t know what to do. I am crushed. She convinced me that we can do this and now she wants to leave 2 months in. I feel so used. When she first told me I was hit with all the bad emotions all at once. It was like a tidal wave hit me. I know I can’t change her mind about this, but Jesus fucking Christ what am I going to do? I’m so stuck with way more money in this than I could’ve ever imagined. She made a whole bag of commitments to me that she flopped on so quick

I was ashamed to admit it, but I think it’s probably important not to beat yourself up too hard about it and just continue on the right path. 

I say relapsed because obviously I had a shit day and fell back into my old habits and that’s lame of me. I did 60mg of oxy. But honestly, I think it helped me overall. I feel a lot less need to go back to it now. I don’t get the same feeling I used to. 

After I did them, I felt TOO fucked up. I never had a ceiling for fucked-up-ness before. I felt sick to my stomach and threw up in between nodding out. The only thing I liked about it is that I fell dead asleep for like 12 hours, but I felt like I couldn’t stop falling asleep throughout the day. I remembered that this is how I felt the first time I ever did them and how I wasn’t that big of a fan until I made a habit of it. It’s just not fun anymore. 

Anyway, I’ve been back on the wagon since. At least I got that out of my system. Btw, this post is NOT an encouragement for any of y’all to give in to the want to relapse.

Weird if it hasn't been asked. Any info or links to other threads would be greatly appreciated.

Is it possible to suffer from PAWS when you switch from a full agonist (in my case, morphine) to a partial agonist (in my case, buprenorphine aka Suboxone)? Or is it considered to be a problem that you only face after quitting all opiates completely?

I switched from morphine (poppy pod tea and PST) to Suboxone about 6 months ago. Tried to get stable on 2mg once a day for a long time, but often took a second, smaller dose in the evening, totaling anywhere from 3mg to 8mg per day. In the last week or so I've been noticing a significant boost in my energy levels and the overall fatigue and depression just disappearing. And I don't even need the whole 2mg anymore, I can do a full day on 1-1,5mg. I just feel so normal. 

Any ideas on what's happening here? Did I just magically stabilize or something, even though my doses have been fluctuating between 2mg to 8mg per day?

2020-02-24 16:20:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/f8yeds/sober_and_depression/,Sober and Depression,"One of the things that isn't very commonly talked about in in early recover is that once you become sober, if you don't have a strong plan in place everything you've worked towards can fall apart and you can start falling back into old bad habits and routines. For me what that meant was that I would become depressed again and it wouldn't go away until I figured out a way to fix it. 

I went to therapy, I talked to my mom about everything that was going on, and actively tried to get a new job after losing one that I loved. I bounced from job to job, and started becoming more and more depressed with where I was at in life and my lack of accomplishments since leaving rehab. 

What I came to realize is that you can be sober from opiates for 8 years but still be incredibly depressed if you don't change your thought process and bad habits. Eventually depression is all I know, and I'm not even sure what happiness for me means anymore. I don't know who I am, what I enjoy doing while sober, so I start to fall back into addict behavior (without using). I'd catch myself lying about the dumbest shit. 

I've worked on a lot of that stuff the last year, and am finally starting to see the light at the end of the very dark tunnel. I attribute a lot of my depression with my lack of motivation, lack of hobbies, and lack of friends to support me being sober. So I made a change. I started going to meetings more frequently, and tried my best to get out of that dry drunk mentality. I stopped playing the victim in every situation and started to figure out why I was feeling so cynical. 

When you're stuck somewhere in life you don't want to be, and it feels like there's no end in sight, just know that eventually if you put your mind to it you can accomplish just about anything, and you don't have to be a slave to your own mind anymore. I know it's a tough journey, just know that its up to you to make it better.

I do not want to go down this road as I have so much to lose and I don't want to hurt my family who I love very much. I keep checking into this sub over the past months which has helped scare me a little and put things into perspective. I need to maintain this kind of attitude but I keep losing my resilience. I need to put a stop to this right now before things get worse. I'm hoping you can offer some words of advice as to how to tame this before it tames me which I fear is right around the corner. I have kratom and subs at hand if I need them but I need to permanently sever ties with H. If it wasn't for this sub, I would probably be in a much worse off position. I'm still in the honeymoon phase but I have serious anxiety about the situation I've put myself in. I have had a lot of stress lately and have been making some really terrible decisions, this being the worst one. I'm scared guys and I haven't even seen the worst of it yet.

This is my first post on reddit. I just want to tell a lil of my story and get it off my chest. I’m a recovering addict. I have been sober now over 2 years and it’s been a tough 2 years. Three years ago I decided I’d  had enough. I have been addicted to opiates since my teen years (the byproduct of constant migraines and a script happy Dr) I ended up physically addicted at 15.

So after around 20years of using, I hit my breaking point and decided to get help. I spent almost a year in treatment but had to be discharged early due to medical reasons. About 3 months after I got out my mother passed away after a long battle with a blood clotting disorder. Yep! You guessed it! I relapsed. After I lost another 8 months to addiction, I managed to pull myself together so I could keep my promise to my Mama and started clawing my way out again.

 I enrolled in a methadone clinic and buckled down to get my life straight. I got a steady job, a car and I started seeing a guy I had known for years. It was an amazing time. I felt like I was finally on the way to having a normal happy life and that this was what life was supposed to be like all along! For the first time in my life I was excited about my future. 

My boyfriend  was wanting to move to Florida before we even got together and he invited me to come as well. I can’t tell you how stoked I was! We lived in Alaska at the time and I have pretty much lived in cold states all my life. I always wanted to move where it had warm weather and sunny beaches, also I was head over heels in love with him so why the hell not? (I should mention that he has a teen son, it is relevant later in the story). Anyway I had multiple conversations with him before the move,  because of my addiction issues I was still baffled that anyone would want a life with me. I asked if he was sure he wanted me to come, to which he always said that he did. 

After months of hard work and packing we finally make the move. As soon as we got to Florida though, his attitude and demeanor started changing.....(y’all can prob guess where this is headed). I got a job about a week after we arrived as a housekeeper at a local hotel. I knew something was up but he kept saying everything was fine so I tried to convince myself of that. 

Then one day about a week and a half in to my new job, he was driving me to work and informed me that he didn’t love me and just wanted it to be him and his son. I was crushed! I had just moved almost 5000 miles and spent every last dime I had to start a life with this guy and 3 weeks in, he is throwing me away?! I didn’t know anyone in Florida and had nowhere to go. I was a pitiful wreck for weeks. I decided I wasn’t going to let this destroy me and I ended up finding and renting a room, then buckled down to try to make a life for myself in Florida. 

I worked really hard at the hotel and made it to the front desk. Learning the ropes of every department from Front desk to maintenance, I threw myself in to my job. My manager (we will call him D) was talking a lot about my future in the company, him wanting to train me up to be in management one day ect.... until one day I accidentally knocked over a sharps container. It was faulty so all the needles spilled out on the floor. 
I was trying to be extremely careful while picking them up but still managed to stick myself. 

That led to a workman’s comp claim and a Dr visit. Well D decided to require a UA. (Remember I said I was going to a methadone clinic)? Now I knew D had a very low opinion of addicts. He made derogatory comments all the time about guests that were suspected of using or just looked like they would. Due to this I was terrified of him finding out I was a recovering addict and did everything in my power to keep it secret but now I had to give a UA.  I. Was. Terrified! Thought for sure going to be fired. I figured the best thing to do would be to get ahead of it. I thought if I told him before the results came back that it would be better. So I told him hoping to salvage my job. He didn’t react much but said something along the lines of we will pretend you never told me this which relieved me somewhat. I still had my job! It was all going to be ok! 

Nope. Everything changed. All of a sudden I couldn’t do anything right. I got really sick and had to call in and he made out like I called in all the time. It was only the second time in a year! He wrote me up for things but not other employees. If I made a mistake he’d harp on it for days. He cut my hours so I was having a really hard time making ends meet. There was no more talk about me moving up in the company or future management positions. 

About when things were starting to go sour  one of our regulars at the hotel (we will call him EW) had been asking me if I’d work with his 24 yo autistic son up in Indiana. I had a great rapport with his son who is a wonderful young man whenever they came to the hotel. So He wanted to hire me as a live in caregiver. I wanted to stay in Florida where it’s warm so I always kind of laughed it off but he was persistent so I started talking to him on the phone to get to know him and the situation with his son better. After a couple of months of talking. I decided to go up there for a week to visit and check it out. EW told me to just quit my job and move to Indiana. If I decided I didn’t like it, no hard feelings and he’d pay me $5000 to hold me till I was able to find another job.I wasn’t wanting to do that so I decided to go up for a week to visit and see how things went. 

Well I WASNT intending to quit my job. A week before I’m supposed to go to Indiana, I show up to work and D calls me in his office. He informs me that he is writing me up AGAIN for something that EVERY SINGLE Front Desk Associate there does frequently but only I was getting written up. I couldn’t take it anymore and I quit. Thinking in the back of my head that I had a job in Indiana or at least the $5000 for cushion that he promised since I had now quit my job. Looking back I wish I hadn’t been such a hot head and quit but we will just chalk that up to the MANY mistakes I have made. 

When I get to Indiana everything is ok the first day or so. Then one morning I wake up to him in my bed kissing on me. I flipped out. He apologized and said he understood when I laid out exactly what I was and WASNT there for. If I had had enough money at the time, I would have bought a ticket home the next day but as it was I was stuck there until my return trip.  He didn’t listen. The entire week he tried to get me to sleep with him even to the point of begging. Telling me he only has 3 months to live and that he’ll marry me and leave everything to me and his son, all I have to do is sleep with him. I honestly thought about it. I’d never have to worry about money again but I’d never be able to live with myself after. The shame I felt from just considering it was enough. I felt hunted the entire week. 

It was coming time for me to leave and he wanted me to go to Florida pack my stuff and come back. I didn’t argue about it, I just let him think that. I sacrificed half of the clothes I brought cause I was just trying to get through my time there safely and figured it was safer if he thought I was coming back. 

When I finally got back to Florida and I informed him that I wasn’t coming back because of his behavior, he refused to pay the money he promised. He told me that I was just a piece of shit junkie and that I threw away the first half of my life and trash should stay thrown away. He said I should have just given it to him because nobody else will ever want me.  He texted my sister and told her I stole money from him to buy drugs and crap like that. 

So now I’m unemployed and back to square one but throughout ALL of this I have not relapsed.I have made many mistakes in the last 2 years but I’ve kept my promise to myself and my Mama. I’m struggling. I don’t know how I’m going to eat or pay my bills but I know im not trash. Even though people treat me and fellow addicts that way. I won’t let them destroy me and I won’t let these people make me feel like I belong in the hole I just scraped & clawed my way out of. Yes, I am a recovering addict. That does not make my life any less important, meaningful, impactful or worth less than anyone else’s. I’m still fighting! It’s been tough and it’s probably going to get tougher but I know I can stay sober through it. I never thought I’d be able to say that. I hope one day that all those suffering with addiction can say it.",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5642689}"

Developed social issues as an adult and never really made and true friends past all my ones from growing up. All but 2 of the whole gang (15+ of us) are locked up, still using daily, or dead. He has 5 kids and a crazy wife (anti vaxx, MLM ""Boss Babe"") type deal and lives a bit away so we don't hang out or hardly talk on the phone. My parents think I got clean and I can't break it to them I'm a failer and a loser, they wouldn't be able to handle it. Plus my moms would be lonely, we were always super close so she is always around plus with her health I help out a lot now. That's all I have.

I work from home so even with work I don't see people, I'm in IT so only need to talk when somehting breaks. I play video games to escape and even then I play solo even though they're all online. I might do the occasional PUG dungeon run in WOW Classic but that's the only time I really talk to people which sucks because it's so much better gaming with friends. I'm getting into Escape From Tarkov and really wish I had people to squad with, same with PUBG. 



I'm just tired of being alone and having no one to talk to or spend my time with. Would be nice to have a girl to wake up to every day instead of the chicken heads I'll pick up at the bar or some get me laid app. I've done what I needed by going to school, getting a big boy job, and started a career which is stalling due to my use. I have men toys like tech, nice sports car, guns, dog, etc and still not happy no. My doggo is about the only thing that make me smile anymore. He's what I look at first thing in the morning since every time I wake up I'm fucking pissed. I wish for death every night and not happy to face another day. I hate to say it but I honestly think I'm at the point I almost want to just end it.


 I'm waiting to see if I can finally break away from opiates (snorting white, no fent when tested a couple times, same plug) Fent almost killed me and I ODed but some how made it out alive and that was the only time I know 100% I got fent or a fent analog and no idea why I went back. I did cut that plug off though and told the bitch she needed to chill with that shit before she kills someone which I'm betting happened. Others who like fent even said her shit was insane even for them. Her loser man got popped selling dope and had his fent with a gun as a felon so she needed money for a lawyer and wanted people to get hooked. He always gave you the option of straight or mixed but she never told anyone. I only have 1 plug and currently thinking of a for sure way besides snitching to burn that bridge. I've tried before but my $100 or so every day or 2 hurts if missing. Any ideas? 


I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe in hopes of finding someone to talk to or game with, would be nice for a RL buddy in central FL. I dunno, I'm just scared I'll fail again and then the very real choice of eating a 12g slug or 00 buck is a reality I must face. Fuck man I'm just so lost and tired.

A summary: I’m a former IV heroin user and will have 3 years clean this May. I’ve completely turned my life around since my days as a drug addict, and will be finishing nursing school around the same time I hit the 3 year mark. 

I hit my rock bottom about 3.5 years ago when I was with my ex-boyfriend, who found out that I was a heroin addict but stayed, for god knows what reason. I think he was just naive, and if he’d known what he was getting into, he probably would’ve left. Or maybe not. He’s about as stupid and stubborn as I am. 

In any case, we’d been together for about 9 months when things started getting much worse (~5 of which he knew I was using and was trying to “help me stop”, in what limited way he could — which really just enabled me at the time). I overdosed in his apartment, and was treated in hospital. I overdosed again a few times over the next few weeks. Finally, with the help of my mom, I got into a state rehab facility. 

My ex initially broke up with me when I went into rehab, but wanted to get back together when I got out. So we did. Again, I don’t think he knew what he was getting into. 

My brain chemistry was not great before I started abusing drugs, and after getting off them, it was *so much* worse. Calling my moods “labile” doesn’t even begin to describe it. I would cry and be overwhelmed by the simplest of life-tasks. I’d get angry because everything was hard and I often directed my anger and frustration at him, because he was there, and for god knows what reason he had me move back in with him almost immediately after rehab. I was just a mess. My brain felt like it was full of static, or bees. I had 3 brief relapses in the 6 months after rehab. 

He broke up with me after about a year of dealing with this. That was a little over 2 years ago now. 

While we were initially together, he rarely expressed anger over what was going on, and was always supportive and loving. Once we broke up, it all came out. He was furious at me. He resents me for putting him through my addiction; for making him witness me nearly dying on his bathroom floor. And he’s still furious at me, several years later. We’ve gotten back together and broken up again multiple times, but it just comes down to him being unable to forgive me for what’s happened. There’s been moments where he said he did, but then the anger resurfaced, and it was clear he still had a lot to work through. 

I assume he loves me if he’s kept me in his life for this long, despite the anger, but I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried so hard to be a better person. I’ve done everything I could possibly do to try to earn his forgiveness for what I put him through. It tears me up inside to realize that nothing I *do* is going to make him forgive me. That he has to *want* to forgive me. That he has let go of the anger himself. 

I love him, and he is the person in this world that knows me best, that I’ve been closest to. But it doesn’t matter. It’s completely out of my control. All I can do is keep trying to be a good person and pay it forward, but it feels like it’s just so...hollow, sometimes.

This turned out more ramble-y and long than I intended. I appreciate anyone who reads this. I just don’t know how to cope with potentially never being forgiven for what I’ve done, regardless of how much I love him, and how much I’ve changed and continue to change.

During my 9 year run smoking BTH I've had plenty of times I detoxed at home or in hotels.  One thing that always made the entire experience easier was food. I know we dont have an appetite but eventually we gotta eat something! Please post what foods helped you, between us all we can help the newbies! :)

Mac N Cheese (my personal fav), Grilled cheese sandwiches, Jello / pudding, Oatmeal, Toast, Cereal Soup and crackers, PB&J!!!  Spaghetti (I would make a pot before I started so it was quick and easy to reheat),
Pasta with butter (any bag of pasta cooked then add some butter)

Its not the healthiest of foods but keep in mind when you can barely eat anything these foods will work.

*SUPER important*
Electrolyte water (I get flavored ones and do half water with them) or just water but drink loads of it. Staying hydrated is one of the essential parts of detoxing. So many friends wound up in the ER because they were so dehydrated. 

Hot tea (try decaffeinated ones)
Protein shakes (one you've had before so you know you'll like it some of them taste like chalk)!
Juice (the fresh squeezed greens & juice are loaded with nutrients)
Hot chocolate  (with mini marshmallows  :)

The only thing I want is peace, but all I feel is ashamed
I've got these sick, sad thoughts and all they do is replay
There's no way this is who I'm meant to be, I want my mind to be released, I want my demons abandoned
They always said it was a shame; I'd watch my body rot any given day of the week, my soul has finally lost any shot of feeling fine again
I see nothing the same, the dark's here to stay
But I'm no more a victim than anyone who feels like me, don't I deserve peace?
It's goddamn hard when you think it never mattered if you'd wake up alive
I often wish I could erase my mind
No more a puppet to all this pain; so close to finally feeling serenity
I shouldn't be on this leash
I will be free, I will decide my own fate
I feel the cold wind on my back, the shackles have been released
Let me out into the world
Cause all I ever want is to be free
I hear the sky calling out my name, you may be you, but I'm not me
Let me out into the world, deliberately
They always said it was a shame
Why can't you just get over it?
It doesn't work that way, this is a sickness
No more preventable than death, I was made like this
Tear out my eyes 'cause
There's nothing to see
I find myself in my head more often than I'm out
This is a sickness
This is a sickness
The thought of joy just hurts me more, and every move feels like a chore
But that's not me, I want release
They say the pain is temporary
They say the feeling isn't bound to last
We cling to light but often find it submits to dark
Dead from the start, I was dead from the fucking start
Maybe I know that I'm not perfect, but I know I don't deserve this prison
That's just who I am, and I can never lose hold, never lose hold again
For once, I'd love to smile
And for once to finally mean it, I don't want to have to lie
It's always looming, it's always there, always growing ever present in my nightmares
It's always looming, another year
Cutting through me, it's gone or I disappear
It's not fair to have to live this way
I see people shrug it off, but it consumes and corrupts me
I'm fucking begging on my hands and knees
I should be long released, why would you keep that from me?
I feel the cold wind on my back, the shackles have been released
Let me out into the world
Cause all I ever want is to be free
I hear the sky calling out my name, you may be you, but I'm not me
Let me out into the world, deliberately
I feel the cold wind on my back, the shackles have been released

I feel like my world is crumbling.,"I really managed to completely destroy everything I loved in life this time around. I don’t even know where to start.

I’m a 25 year old male. I was using heroin for about 4 years. Over 3 years was spent snorting it and then the last half year or so before I got clean I started to IV.

I just got out of treatment about a week ago. I live with my parents.

I also was prescribed klonopin and got off of it while I was away there. 

Sitting alone at home is driving me crazy. I have SO much rebound anxiety it’s crazy. I’ve never come off benzos and opiates at the same time, and it seems like the IV opiate usage in conjunction with the benzo usage is kicking my ass with PAWS.

I don’t know what happened. I was eating normally finally in rehab (I’m a small ass guy) and feeling a lot better being around people I could vent to.

Since I’ve gotten out I barely have an appetite and I’m super down. When I left rehab and got in the car I had a huge wave of depression set in immediately.

I just feel so wound up while I’m alone. So I’ve been going to meetings and I notice it helps  mentally but then I leave and my depression and anxiety kicks back in.

I should be calling my job because I’m pretty sure they’d let me come back— but I’m too anxious to feel uncomfortable making the phone call and being asked any questions... or potentially being told I can’t come back. It’s driving me crazy.

I have a girlfriend whose 5 years older than me and she’s super supportive but I feel terrible because she has her shit together, works her ass off, and is just in general awesome (and doesn’t use drugs). She has her own house and it makes me realize how sad it is that I don’t have my own car (crashed mine) or place. Even though we’ve talked about me moving in, it makes me feel like a failure as a man.

I feel so codependent. I’ve lost most of my friends during my addiction. I had a good paying job that I’m afraid to ask to put be back on the schedule for. I know if I went back without using like I was I’d be able to save so much money and have a lot or awesome things happen— but I’m so nervous to contact them.

I’m sorry I’m all over the place— this is what gets to me the most. I feel like my brain is just DEAD. I can’t form coherent sentences, I forget simple words all the time, and I just feel so damn stupid and awkward.

I used to be a social justice warrior screaming from the rooftops that the easy way was the better way. I used to believe that drug use if allowed to be legal wouldn't harm the communities it occurred in or the people wrapped up in it, boy was I wrong.

I thought cigarettes were cool until I saw the end of the life of people who smoked, all the while convincing myself that this wouldn't happen to me. In the early stages of marijuana use I still excelled in my grades and thought this is harmless why is it illegal? Then the memory and money issues sat in, and the people I participated in smoking it with dropped out of school and encouraged me to do the same. Then came opiates, I saw them as societally acceptable with little harm associated, until my money ran out and I got on methadone.

Oh, I thought to myself, there is little harm here look nurses and doctors give it out. Was it healthy, was it safe? Fuck no! I ballooned out with stretch marks all over not shitting for days sometimes weeks and you still believe that this medication is safe with just some side effects?

Methadone and other maintenance drugs are just an extended stay on death row. They are the bitchification of man and the dickification of women. All drugs are harmful but in my delusion I thought that those harms wouldn't fall on me.

Men, I ask you to stand up for yourself, your community, your children, your wife, your mothers and fathers. I ask you to approach life on life's terms living one day at a time. It's time to become strong again, it is time for you to take your role in society.

Feel your emotions, hormones, and pain knowing that all the while you are a living breathing being.

Here are some case studies on opiates/opioids that have supporting facts associated with these drugs that ultimatley seek to make you androgynous.

I think about a week to a week and a half and ago (maybe even 2, but I don't think so... I was given a narco recently for a toothache that did nothing for me, pain-wise or any-wise. I think I remember, when first prescribed subs, that it takes about 14 days to leave your system - or essentially for it's blocking capabilities to lighten up. But then again, my liver is probably way more backed up than it was then.) For the most part, I don't feel too uncomfortable. Unless I oversleep or go way too long without some kratom. But even then, on my best days, I won't touch the stuff for 12 hours and feel pretty OK. 

I figure some light kratom withdrawal has something to do with it, considering I don't feel nearly as bad as I did when I couldn't take a sub. But I also don't take a whole lot of it. Considering I won't take the capsules, and the powder is disgusting, it takes me a lot of extra effort to take my doses of kratom. Which I figure is just sort of a blessing in disguise.

**Anyway, most times that I get a full nights rest, I wake up chilly, and sweating bullets**. Even if I don't feel uncomfortable. 

I feel like the answer may be simple enough, and I'm sort of just hoping that it is: That my body is still detoxing (although, taking annoyingly long), and that's my body pushing it out like a fever. 

But I just wanted to check here and see if anyone else has had any similar experiences while quitting (officially) suboxone. How long did you get the sweats for? Or feel general discomfort for? Varied experiences with cold turkey, or tapering aides such as myself, all welcome. 

They're just starting to freak me out a bit, considering that my last day of suboxone grows farther and farther away. 

*P.S. For anyone quitting suboxone reading this - please do not let this discourage you or let it sound nightmarish. (I was just there.) It's not. It's just a small compromise, but one that is absolutely worth it. As uncomfortable as it gets, it's much more simple.

Ive always been kind of a contrarian miserable fuck. All the zoloft seems to do is make me shit my guts out for the first half of the day. I count the things i like about myself on 2 fingers. I feel like im by myself in a crowded room. I resent having to go to my meetings. I dont go anywhere. I dont do anything. I wake up, stuff my face, watch the news, go to my minimum wage job, come home, watch videos on my ipad in bed, and then do the whole thing over again.

Ive stared in the mirror smiling, hoping the “fake it tillI you make it” voodoo bc would work its magic, but i just looked like a fat serial killer.

Poured it on the carpet, turned the lights off.

Im just not sure at what point im supposed to feel like a normal human being again. If your brain is genuinely just fucked and youre chemically imbalanced, im not sure any amount of informational pamphlets and bad coffee is going to get me right.

2020-02-16 09:45:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/f4rjf4/day_10_my_thoughts/,Day 10 - my thoughts,"I’ve been an opiate user for the last 15 or so years but was always able to keep it to weekends and not think about it during the week. Fast forward to the last couple years and it has become a daily problem. Found H/Fent and its now game over. Wanted to post my thoughts over the last 10 days.

First, anyone who says you will be feeling better after 3 days is full of shit. It took until the 6th day and 10+ pounds lost later that I finally was able to stomach down some real food besides soup broth and a piece of buttered toast. I told my mom everything and she has been staying with me taking care of me which is very nice. 

2. The first 5-6 days when all u are doing is laying around, can’t move, yet can’t stop shaking and having that feeling of general restlessness is the absolute worst. One hour feels like 3 days and it doesn’t take long before you are SO bored yet can’t move/get out of bed. So you lay there shaking watching the minutes/seconds tick by. One person had wrote that anyone who doesn’t consider suicide doesn’t have a creative imagination to life’s problems and boy that is the truth. General restlessness / RLS is the ABSOLUTE WORST feeling in the fucking world! On a positive note, last night was the first night I didn’t shake uncontrollably and slept from 12:30 till 5:30 YAY!

3. Getting better is the slowest process known to man. You literally feel like 50% after a week and then get better like 1% a day after that. It is slow and can drive you mad. Day 7 me and my mom went to Chipotle and I ate 1 hard shell taco.  Day 8 we went out again (I ate more food) and also went to the gym and sat in the sauna for 20 min. Day 9 I ate more, and went to the gym, walked 1 mile on the treadmill, hit the steam room.. You see what I’m getting at?? Small steps. The rest of the time I lay on the couch cuz I get tired too easily. Ppl writing they are hitting the gym hard day 6- fuck yall. 

4. Comfort meds. I had Clonidine, requip, trazadone, and gabapentin- I took high enough doses the first week and they don’t do shit. Ppl saying how gabapentin cured there restlessness or how clonidine helped so much. I didnt have bad sweats but besides that- comfort meds are kinda bullshit. They don’t stop the restlessness which is the WORST part. Seriously folks, imagine 24/7 feeling of can’t get comfortable. For 4+ days. Can’t eat/move. So u flop like a fish waiting for those moments where u finally are still - it is usually for less than 5 minutes, but when they come and u lay there still, they are the best moments of your life. Then u either fall asleep for 10-30 min or the restlessness picks back up again. It’s maddening. 

5. Finally, I’m at day 10. Haven’t taken Imodium for two days and have shit normal day 9 and also this morning 🤠. Physical symptoms that remain are general malaise (get tired very easily and small chores like take a shower seem daunting but doable), very minor rls (I can stop it if I notice I’m doing it but sometimes I don’t realize I’m doing it), very minor discomfort/can’t get comfortable, poor sleep ( 5 last night, prbly 12 or so total the previous 9 days in 10-30 min stints) I’m only taking .2 clonidine and 600mg gabapentin at night to sleep- stopped everything else. Plan to go the gym today and maybe go thru the motions of lifting weights with the machines and/or jogging 1 mile (see baby steps). 

6. Future- if anyone wants updates beyond this let me know! This won’t be one of those I went back to the gear after x amount of days Becuz I have no choice. I got fucked at work and find out tomorrow what my punishment is going to be. I know I’m subject to u/a’s for the next 2 yrs which is fine and prbly good becuz it holds me accountable - but if they make me do inpatient for any amount of days I’m going to crack. I have to do what they say tho, no choice. A little too much sauce at works = No Bueno.. ok I’m done for now.

He pissed the fucking bed and threw up all over the bathroom and if that was it I would've been really angry but neither of us drink very often (I will have a beer or two with dinner but I don't have any more than 3 drinks in one sitting, ever, anymore) so I probably would've been angry but not infuriated.  

But he did a bunch of other shitty stuff that terrified me, thank fucking god I got him to sleep in the second bedroom and locked me and the dogs in the main bedroom.  

Sometimes im like... I'm so fucking broken that I can normalize anything. When will it finally hit me that I should leave? When im mid way through getting stabbed to fucking death? I found the biggest and sharpest knife we own in the bathroom after he'd passed out and he tells me this morning he couldn't get his boots off and was gonna cut them but I don't believe that for a second considering he doesn't remember anything else he did.  

I had absolutely zero expectations for valentine's day, I have zero expectations from anyone I've dated. I was telling my therapist yesterday that I always am ready for the absolute worst because I've had it happen and not expected it and that is the worst, weakest feeling in the world. And then ironically enough that night it happens- I actually WASN'T expecting the worst but I got hit with it. It's been a while since i let my guard down (ie didn't expect everything to devolve into abuse and hell) and I'm fucking pissed at myself for doing so.  

I remember when I was younger and i thought people who were numb and could deal with the worst were tough as fuck. Years before I ever shot dope i was surrounded by friends who did who were all as broken as I am now. It looked to me like the world couldn't harm them ever as much as they harmed themselves and I wanted that control.  Now I've got it and it fucking sucks.  

I wish I was normal but it's a little too late for that now. I want to kick R out but my mind is in peak junkie mode right now except instead of a drug it's a person. I'll tell him to go then be like ""WAIT if you apologize or do x y z""... saying that while full knowing he'll say yeah and then do NONE of it! It's literally the same stupid mechanism that kept me addicted to dope for so long. How the fuck do I get the strength to fix this. I can read everything online of similar situations and know I have to end it and all of you can tell me to end it but I fucking won't because even though I ain't shooting up anymore my brain is still one of an addict.  

I need the strength to do it. I am strong but in all the wrong ways. Im strong Cuz I can put up with things that others would cause a nightmare. Or is that being weak? Or just having low standards? I do not even fucking know anymore.  

On a better note, dunno if anyone listens to $uicideboy$ but their new mixtape came out yesterday and it's dope like a combo of old Memphis rap and new school lil peep ish influences. That band always makes me feel better.

I'm a naloxone distribution specialist working for Harm Reduction Ohio, a non-profit organization that supports drug policies based on science, health, compassion and human rights. We have a mail-order naloxone program that we started advertising to public in January. For anybody who uses opioids and anybody who interacts with them, naloxone is vital to have on hand. Ohioans can go to https://www.harmreductionohio.org/get-naloxone/ and order Narcan nasal spray or intramuscular intramuscular for free to be delivered via mail. I personally package and ship the majority of the orders. Five people last month reported that the kits they received in the mail were used to save somebody's life. Having this medication on hand can make all the difference during an overdose.

If you live in the US but not in Ohio, you can still get free mail-order naloxone at https://www.naloxoneforall.org/.

If you are financially willing and able, we would greatly appreciate a donation of any amount. We are a very small non-profit organization funded exclusively by grants at the moment. It costs about $5 to ship each package, including supplies and postage. I would like for this program to go on for many years, but that will only be possible if we can get the funding.

Over the last few weeks my schedule changed giving me more free time, and a day off during the week, I’ve gotten high probably 5x in the last 20 days, most recent being Saturday night , and than this Monday also.  

Yesterday I had bad chills, anxious sweating, and those mental wd symptoms and now today I’m craving.  What the fuckkkk did I get myself back into.  I know what the right thing to do is in my current situation....

Monday, the day of the relapse, my fiancé had come home for lunch and we wound up getting pills. Those three pills turned into seven when our plug came over and handed my fiancé the entire bottle, saying, “here man, I’ve only got seven left. Just get me later.” Which he accepted, despite me saying otherwise. My blood boiled. 

Obviously, our relationship is in serious trouble. So, after my fiancé left, I wrote him a letter pleading for him to get help. I told him what I wanted out of our relationship and that with opiates in the picture, those dreams were never coming true. I also reminded him that my life is depending on receiving medical treatment. Treatment that I’ve been waiting on getting because of this sort of bullshit. Basically, I told him that things were entirely out of control and enough is enough. When he got home from work, I hid the letter in his lunchbox and texted him the following morning to read it and to take the day to think about what I wrote. He’s agreed to actually put effort into stopping and going into treatment once his insurance at work kicks in in about a month.

It’s progress, however I’m not getting my hopes up. This is one of those “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” scenarios. At least he knows how I feel now. He hadn’t realized things had gotten that bad or that I felt that strongly about our situation, which, in his defense, he wouldn’t because it’s my first time actually voicing it. My stance on quitting is a recent development. 

It’s a shitty, rainy day outside today and I’m due for my next hormone replacement therapy pellet implant on Monday. Quitting gets a million times harder when my hormones are tanking like this....I can’t wait until Monday! I am NOT feeling life today, but that’s ok. I’ve got some other coping skills I can lean on to get me through this. I hope I make it today. Today, I stay clean.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46198332}"

I used to think it was being fucked up on something or other all the time that made my sleep schedule be like 2am-11am but as time goes on im kinda realizing that's just my natural circadian rhythm. Or at the very least midnight to 8am... oh well what can ya do. Just gotta suck it up sometimes.  

So my dog got spayed on tuesday, I was so fucking anxious all day and had a math test last period that I had to speed to finish so I could get there to pick her up on time, not ideal. The only reason I was anxious was from the fact I worked at a vet as a tech assistant for about a year and saw probably hundreds of spays go perfectly fine but I have witnessed complications a few times and once you've seen that shit on the back end ofc I couldn't help but thinking about her getting intubated, waking up from anesthesia, etc... I forced myself to not think of the worst and luckily they called me a few hours before I picked her up to let me know it all went fine.  

She got prescribed pain meds for the first few days of recovery ofc, and also trazadone because she can be so hyper (she's STOKED to go to the vet since she grew up at one but it can definitely become an issue Cuz she is HYPER hyper lol). Honestly even admitting this feels so fucking gross to me because it's such a fucking junkie thing but this time a year ago I would've fucking thought about taking her meds myself. God just knowing that that thought would ever have crossed my mind disgusts me. Now I would never fucking dare. I hate myself for ever not putting my dog first but all i can do now is continue to rectify any mistakes I have made. But yeah for sure there was a time, a long time, where any drugs in this house woulda made it into my system regardless of who they were prescribed to.  

Anyway hope everyone is doing alright today! Anyone doing anything fun for ~valentine's day~? I'll be working that night which is definitely gonna be fun and I'm gonna make $$, already have the entire restaurant booked up so I'm hoping we don't get too many walk ins we gotta turn away, always makes me feel like a dick (and less $ for me lol). R has money put aside Cuz he actually wanted to do something for valentine's day since the last time he got me a present or anything was xmas 2018. I didn't believe him at first but I think he's actually dead set on doing some shit for me so we'll see how tf i react to that Cuz at this point I do not like other ppl buying me stuff.

I haven't taken heroin in over 10 months now. However, I have been taking kratom this whole time and desperately trying to quit. I have been successful on tapering my usage of that down. But still, even while taking kratom, and throughout this whole thing, I get those dreaded full body chills. They run down my back, and all throughout my torso and neck like an electric shock. Sweating, for some reason, is always extremely unpleasant. I get that weird, all too familiar, hard to describe feeling that gives me goosebumps and makes my body tense up.

I just took a tiny dose of kratom after waiting a long time since my last dose. For some reason I'm hot now, getting chills, and feel those electric surges. Why the hell am I like this? It makes me think that maybe these symptoms aren't from my kratom addiction at all. I really don't even take that much, but obviously it must be significant since I have to taper to quit. I don't even like the feeling of my hair on my neck as that oftentimes triggers my goosebumps, probably gonna get a haircut soon.

My last shining ray of hope is to completely eliminate kratom from my life, as then I will be off ALL substances completely. I have this dark and brooding feeling that these chills, fatigue, and overall crappy feeling will not go away. They are too frequent and common for them to be ""just from the kratom"", especially since I often get them when I'm on the stuff, just not as intense.

I secretly suspect that a significant heroin addiction is something that you never recover from. I fear that all of the sponsors, spokespeople, and survivors hide this fact that they're still physically suffering and just learned to cope with it. Because what good would it do to speak of it? It would only scare people who are considering quitting. I understand that I have other problems, but this one thing has really been bumming me out lately.

So do ""the chills"" ever go away? I don't know how I'm going to cope with this for the rest of my life. I must have damaged my brain beyond repair. I can be relatively happy, but only when I'm sitting in my room all day. This is why I said I have other problems too, but ""the chills"" are seriously hindering me from getting out of the house. I can't live like this forever. Granted, I have been tapering pretty hard from kratom, but I feel like these symptoms are more than just from that.

P.S. I've never posted on this sub before, or really even read it that much. I'm kind of going in blind here, so I hope my post is in line with what's accepted here. Thanks",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8724068}"

I left her dad 2 years ago, about a year prior to that I had to send her to live with my mother because she and her dad would get into fist fights and screaming match, and we also have a you get child that didn’t need to see that.  She was diagnosed as bipolar when she was about 15 and spent a solid month in children’s psych for cutting.  When she was 16 she got suspended and we took her to rehab after we were called to get her at school because she was high. We have had her in therapy since she was 8.   I blame myself a lot for her current situation.  After she all that and being moved to my mothers house in a different part of the state, she got in with the wrong crowd that liked guns and drugs.  She refused to take birth control and ended up pregnant at 17.  She refused to give up the baby, so my mother usually had to take care of the child (and is very attached now).  The father of the child went to federal prison and is still there for gun charges as well as violating parole and trying to run.  

Fast forward to now... she got out of jail yesterday after being there for several days.   Apparently she had someone at my mothers house who almost overdosed on heroine, and is now permanently blind.  I understand after talking to her that it was his intention to overdose.  The police showed up with an ambulance and CPS showed up too.  My mom had to beg to keep the baby.  The police took my daughter and searched my moms entire house until my mom asked them to leave.  CPS told my mom that my daughter is not allowed to ever be at her house and my not see the baby unless they are at the DHR office supervised.  She called me from jail and said she wanted to stay with me and begged me to bail her out (she said she would go work and pay me back within 24 hours ... she works at a strip club which doesn’t help the situation. I told her no and I didn’t have the heart to tell her she couldn’t stay with me, so my mom did.   I’m afraid now that she feels like I’ve thrown her away and that I don’t love her.  Her sister is only 10 and is a really good child and doesn’t need to be around drugs and I don’t want my things stolen (she’s nearly spent my moms entire retirement from various occasions of stealing her credit cards and debit cards).  Aside from that I’m a teacher and can’t risk my entire career if this happens again.  She told us she wanted to get clean but she says she only wants to do the drug court she was ordered to do and has told my mom that she doesn’t want to go to a rehab facility.  Currently she is staying with friends.   We have a history of addiction in our family as I was adopted because my biological mom had a drug problem and when I was 17 I put her ashes in the ground after a heroine overdose. I feel she has to get out of this or something very bad is going to happen.  I’m afraid and I really want her to go somewhere out of state and get some help.

Part of our psychiatric clinical rotation was to go to a state addiction treatment center, where we would assess patients in their stages of withdrawal, and give a few presentations while we were there. It was, of course, the same facility I went to while in the grips of IV heroin addiction. 

I got to stand up in front of a group of addicts, in the same room I sat in for 21 days in a row, and explain how their addiction works and how to fight it. 

I got to tell these people that they needed to give themselves more, because they’re worth more than the life they’ve been living. 

I never told them I was a former addict, let alone that I had been a patient there just like them. Although, as I spoke one-on-one with a patient about his plan to taper with subutex, he said, “Wow, you’re really knowledgeable about all this.” And I replied, “Yeah, well, I have...a lot of experience with this subject.” And he just kind of laughed and said, “Got it, you don’t have to say anything else.” 

One of the patients I helped admit for alcohol detox wasn’t sure he’d stay the full 21 days. He thought he might just do the detox and leave.

I came up to him at the end of the day and told him, “Hey man, I know you didn’t ask for my opinion. But I really think you should stay the whole time. Give yourself some time to just focus on you and your recovery. Getting some space away from the outside world can make a difference.” And he said he’d think about it.

He was still there when I came back the next week. I told him I’d been thinking about him over the weekend and that I was so proud he’d decided to stay. It felt good. It felt like a small victory, even though I’m sure I wasn’t the deciding factor in all of it. It felt like I made a difference, and paid it forward, just a tiny bit. 

I don’t really have any point in writing this other than just to kind of get it out of my head. It was both a surreal and jarring couple weeks. I never thought I’d go back to that rehab, but the circumstances in which I did made it all just feel...I don’t know. I’d like to say it makes me feel as though I’ve come a long way, but I struggle with so much guilt still, that it’s hard to acknowledge it. This experience was humbling though, and reminded me of where I came from. 

I graduate from nursing school on May 19th. On May 21st, I’ll have 3 consecutive years clean from opiates. Pretty cool.

They'll put me on Subs first and I can switch to mdone if subs dont work well with me which is nice.

I’ve been taking Oxycodone IR (15-45mg daily) for about 2.5 years now to deal with chronic pain caused by bulging lumbar discs and degenerative disc disease. I’m only in my 30s, but my back feels like I would imagine someone feels like when they are in their 70s. I recently started dosing 2x daily, once around noon (7.5mg) and once around 5:30p (30-37.5mg). I also have ADHD and have found myself back on dextroamphetamine for the past year. I managed to get off it for two years and, during the break, felt much more like myself. Between the two mediations I have completely lost myself and my purpose. I don’t laugh with my wife and kids anymore and am grouchy almost all the time. I also crave oxy more than ever. I don’t really enjoy taking the dex, but it gives me “energy” to get through the day and can tide me over until my next dose of oxy. 

My wife doesn’t know about the oxycodone, as I didn’t want her to be worried that I was taking it long-term. Like everyone, in the beginning I thought I had it all under control. Surprisingly, I’ve managed to only take 1/2 of what I was prescribed over the last 2.5 years. 

I’ve managed to create a real mess here. I have plenty of both medications to do a long-term taper, if recommended. I also have Gabapentin, Lyrica, Xanax, Klonopin, and clonidine. I’ve made half-ass attempts to quit before but didn’t want to give it my all until I knew I was ready to be done. Which is now!!! I can’t continue living a lie and need my life back so I can be emotionally supportive to my wife and kids. I’ve lost my desire to use cannabis, even though I can legally use it and have a good amount of it left over from last year, when it still appealed to me. 

I’m also sick with a nasty cold right now, which zaps my energy and emotion even further. If you have any suggestions that can help me get off the oxy and dex, please share with me. Thank you.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.61759883}"

I barely slept due to the opiates in my system and I’m constipated. Christ, how everything yesterday went so very, very wrong. 

Yesterday was one of those days where my emotions sat right below the surface, just waiting to come flooding out. And boy, did they. Publicly, I might add.

Ran up to my drs office to grab a couple supplements that had just come in for me when the lady at the front desk asked me, “how’s your dad?” I balked at this question.....felt my throat suddenly choke up and tears began welling in my eyes. “He’s dying. I had to put him into hospice two weeks ago.” “I know,” she said. “Is he still talking? My neighbor just passed last night. He was found dead after I did a wellness check on him” “Kind of. I’ve, I’ve gotta go,” I managed to stammer out, grabbing tissues off the desk as tears started rolling down my face. I ugly cried all the way home. I felt so small and consumed by grief. 

I know the lady at the front desk fairly well. I’ve been seeing this doctor for about eight months and have a pretty close relationship with everyone there. They only take the tough cases. You know, people who would otherwise die without intensive intervention. I’ve been in there at my lowest health wise, back when I couldn’t drive and was on deaths door. She was just trying to connect with me and gauge where my fathers Alzheimer’s disease was. People say the odd shit in those circumstances all the time. I feel bad for not being able to hold it together to have the conversation. 

I didn’t know what to do with myself when I got home so I just sat in my car for awhile. Then I aimlessly drove down the street, only to come back and sit some more. I just felt so lost. I picked up my phone to call my fiancé, but he wasn’t exactly supportive. He was upset about money and at work, so took it out on me. I reminded him finances do this when you clean up, but he was more upset that I paid my drs bill on time. I didn’t want to feel this anymore. So, I made the call, got a pill, took it and embraced the nothingness. 

It sucked.

When my fiancé got home, he was hell bent on getting high, so he did. Bought 4 with our grocery money, but wound up giving me one and a half and not because I asked. Yes, you heard that right...the same person who got upset about finances just spent part of our grocery money on pills, but this is how addiction works. I tried to abstain, but my internal bargaining kicked in and I failed. How could I say no with it in my face?

I’m starting to realize that my best friend is a bit of an asshole. Once I’m healed, I’m most likely going to have to leave him if I want to fully embrace a sober lifestyle. He doesn’t want to get sober for himself and is only trying to do so to keep me in the picture. Drugs are the reason we’re not married. I refuse to do so unless some major changes happen. I’d leave, but I’m completely dependent on him right now. He supports me financially and has done so since my health failed a couple years ago. There is no one else in my life willing or able to do this. 

So, I’m back at day one, but I’m not upset about it. Getting upset won’t change what happened. My situation is what it is right now. I’m embracing acceptance and just going to get through my day, moment by moment. It’s all I can do. In retrospect, I reached out to the wrong person. Soon I will be better health wise and be able to make my own decisions. Time is my friend and I must remain patient.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.84653485}"

As the years go by faster it feels less and less likely I could ever return to normality, I feel that I’ll get to a point before long that if I even get clean I am going to have lost so so much from my addiction that facing that and coming clean might be mentally unbearable - another thing to have to hide from/block out. I am so sick of it, and the thing is I am desperately wanting to get clean - I have no idea how to even start, and the line spewed out all the time of “talk to someone and get hell” is laughable - there’s no hell I can find in the UK unless you’re very rich for private rehab or you want to queue up every day for methadone, which is the only treatment offered (possibly can get on subs as an alternative to methadone)

My situation is that I started on OxyContin for chronic illness probably 4-5 years ago. The truth is I had already played about with it recreationally and knew I could get pain meds out the Dr and over time complained about them all until I was given Oxycodone on a pretty much permanent repeat prescription up to 280mg daily. These took over my life about 4 years ago - I snort the tablets I don’t swallow them, and I take anywhere from 300mg to 1200mg daily (it sounds a mental dose but 4 years in without a break it doesn’t actually do as much as you’d think) Everything I do revolves around them, and I had considered myself high function- I still run a business (just!! - and only because I drag myself thru it as I couldn’t afford the extras if I didn’t). I have pretty much never had anything more than 24-36 hours off in all that time - and the WD I had after that were grim enough, so I can’t imagine what 5-7 day of CT feels like

I have begged my Dr for help - his solution was to taper me off with zero other help. So now I have to buy more tablets. That’s all. I went to local drug treatment that is run by the NHS here in the U.K. and basically you can go on methadone - not something I will go anywhere near, it’s an awful drug. They have said I could go on subs instead, now I know MAT isn’t clean but I am wondering if I should switch from Oxy’s to subs to stabilise a bit, and taper off subs as I have zero control if I was to taper of Oxys (I’ve tried more time’s than I care to remember)

Cold Turkey seems to be my only other option - I don’t think I’d stick it, I could get anything like Xanax, gabs etc to get thru but I feel like it’s potentially gonna take me out the game for months?! I have never come off, not once in l this time - I did 30+ hours once coming back from Thailand and I was a MESS 

Basically - what would be my best options in people’s experience? I have become an addict in a ‘bubble’ and have no one to give me any advice at all so I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I would grab any help with both hands but it’s not there. 

My gut feeling is maybe subs would give me some stability to not feel smashed/tired/chasing tablets 24/7 and then I could carry on with my business and life etc whilst slowly tapering down. That’s what I’m led to believe is possible - but is it?! What would people suggest?I have no one to talk to about this and I feel like it’s inevitable that this will kill me if I don’t do something, and I wanna get my life back before it’s too late.

As the title states, this February 12th will be exactly 15 months into my recovery from Heroin. Or:

•457 days

• 1 year and 3 months 

I wanted to make this post because I’ve seen a lot of people who are making posts about being a couple weeks into their recovery, and I’d like to show them or y’all that they/ you can also rack up your clean time to where you’re at 3 months, then 5, then 8, then 12, then 15, etc. 

It really feels great with each extra month you hit, and to be 110% honest— the more months you rack up, the less you even think about, “Oh, it’s month 18”, for example. 

I really do not want to come off like, “I’m soooo cool because I have 15 months”, not at all. I just hope to show you guys that it’s possible to get clean and maintain that clean time. 

Hell— 3 days ago I was chilling with my girl and long story short we went by the west side to cop some bud, just because my guy who lives by me wasn’t replying and we wanted to take a blunt cruise to the city, (I live about 18 miles outside of a large Midwest city that has a lake which meets Mich).

Anyways, I told her to grab 3 grams of bud from her guy, and she runs up and gets it and comes back, and she pulls it out and we both were like, “What the fuck..???” — Long story short it was Heroin. (She ran it back and I got my bud though, but still...) 

And besides that, I have another friend who gets Norcos prescribed but also buys about 170 10mg Norcos every week to sell and also keep some for herself. So when I chill with her they’re like always around, (🙄), which I have brought up to her. 

In the beginning of my recovery I wasn’t around Norcos or Heroin just because I just kinda stayed to myself and just worked and stuff, but it’s just funny how now I don’t even entertain the idea of relapsing— it’s absolutely laughable. 

I don’t know y’all— I just feel like the dope game now isn’t what it used to be even 2 years ago. Like I said, the other day I drove by where I used to pick up— my girl and I literally parked *right where* we used to to grab from our other dude we’d grab from back then, and she ran up but grabbed from her newer dude. 

But I don’t know, I just feel like sobriety from H is so much better than doing the absolute most just to feel numb for 2 hours— because that’s how it is now with the Fent-cut *everything*, unless you’re fuckin with straight Oxys or script opiates. But still, just not worth it for/ to me. 


I hope y’all stay safe, and if relapsing is something you’re considering doing— please just don’t, it’s not worth it, but more importantly, be safe. Do it with people around, even if they don’t know you use. You’d rather have them call 911 to revive you if you were to OD than for you to OD alone and pass away.  



TLDR; The dope game just isn’t what it used to be. Give sobriety a try— if you really don’t like it, the drugs will always be there. Feb 12th will be 15 months of sobriety from Heroin and opiates for me. It’s worth it, and though lately I’ve been struggling— it’s so much better than struggling in addiction.

Kind of long I'm sorry.

I haven't really used much since mid October, I have drank a few times and one day I did take about 50Mg of Oxy and 1Mg of Clonazepam (what a great night), so I can't say I've been completely clean. I've been on subs since early November and while a part of me is happy about many things, I just feel completely empty. I left my job while on leave due to personal, management issues and just too many damn hours, I wasn't able to live and work, let alone do anything sobriety related. After almost 3 months of looking I still can't find a job, or rather they just never respond, well except for one. 

With this new found time I've been able to explore myself, mainly artistically, with painting becoming a huge part of my life in such a short time and I believe I've managed to impress even myself with how well I've gotten. I've also manage to read, write, draw a lot more, doing the thing I've failed to do for my entire life, simply giving myself permission.

I can't say if I actually reached my bottom before committing, considering my life was semi-stable for the most part, though I've always had and probably will always have relationship/people issues. Probably irrelevant to say but whatever.

I guess I should get to the point. Despite doing better in my life, doing art, getting doctors and proper medication, staying clean, I feel empty. I'm still alone and isolated, even more so now. I don't think I can function without opiates, hell just drugs on general. There's a part of me that's incomplete, I feel as if getting clean, leaving a job that made me miserable, has sort of done more harm than good. It really is a stupid way to think and I'm probably wrong.

My experience was very different from what people usually experience so I was wondering if someone could enlighten me. 
Everywhere I’ve read that the amount and how one uses opiates doesn’t necessarily affect the severity of withdrawal. In context, I’ve smoked heroin for about 5 months and was dependent for about 3. I’d smoke very couple hours through the day and would use anywhere from 1-3grams a week depending on the potency of the sack. Did this for about 2-3 months.
Also I’ve never tried quitting so I’ve never gone more than 12hrs (I would usually get the sweats like crazy, hot and cold flashes and stomach pains within 6-8hrs of last use) without dope prior to this experience. 
My first 24hrs were the worst. I had chills in my bones that could not be warmed and aching in my joints. Also had restless legs so overall had a hard time sleeping. By hour 48 I didn’t feel horribly sick, just felt very down, and fatigued with still some chills. So in order to lift my mood, I decided to smoke weed. (I used to be a everyday smoker years ago but quit about 5-6 years ago). It helped brighten my mood and gave my appetite back. Only problem is being high my will power was shaken and so about 54hrs since my last use I took a tiny smoke of dope. Then went to bed. And I slept well. 
The next morning I woke up at about 5:30am. I was planning on not going to work especially because I felt so down emotionally and fatigued, but I help the family business so I sucked it up. I decided to take 7.5mg of an old addy plus 1mg of klonopin and I made it through work although I was physically exhausted at the end and still did not have an appetite. 
This morning I woke up at about 5:00am, thought bout resting at home but decided to tough it out again since I did yesterday and it was not too bad. As I lay in bed contemplating work, I decided to smoke a little more dope for a little boost. Now it’s been 7hrs since my last little smoke and I don’t feel physically bad, although I’m punching myself in the head mentally for being so weak. If only my room mate had locked up the dope like I asked him to. 

Anyways long story short, I’m just curious on opinions on my experience trying to kick it. I have been on comfort meds that I listed for the last 4-5 days. Yet I never felt truly terrible like many experience, but I never did make it to hours 72-96hr when withdrawal is supposed to peak. Even then I don’t feel the need to smoke cus I’m not getting physical withdrawals, just mental cravings. Is it possible to have a quick and rather painless detox? Finally if not will me smoking a little this morning send me back into a full week long of withdrawing to detox? Regardless I still desire to quit for good so I’m going to push for 7 days this time, and it should be easier cus my roommate who also uses is moving out in a few days

I’ve been on methadone for exactly two and half years this month. Clean for two years, one month. I started my taper from 90 mg, over a year ago. A whole fucking year guys. If you’re considering MAT, please keep this in mind with how far up you take your dose. MAT saved my life, but you can’t just stop when you’re ready to be done. You’re going to have to come down eventually, and I really wish someone would have told me just how long it takes to accomplish that. 

Anyway, so I’m at the clinic last Tuesday, dropping my dose down to the very last of it, one week of 3 mg take homes, and another week of 1 mg take homes. As I’m getting my doses and repeatedly telling the nurse that I’m on a taper, as he’s on the phone, fucking around with the computer, just not paying the fuck attention, at all, while he’s filling up my bottles, and subsequently dropping them all over the place, messing up the order. Finally, nurse wacky gets off the phone, and I repeat, “I am on a taper”. The light comes on, finally, and he realizes his mistake. He acts like he has it under control, and labels them. I am unamused, but give him the benefit of the doubt. 

The next day, it’s time to go to work, and I feel like total shit. Chalking it up to a cold, and the bleary Pacific Northwestern weather, I carry on. It isn’t until the following Friday I realize, I’m in fucking withdrawal! I check my bottles, and sure enough, they’re mislabeled. I took several of the 1 mg doses already, thus, completely fucking up my entire last two weeks of taper. 

I. AM. FURIOUS. 

Just one more ‘fuck you’ in a long line of ‘fuck you’s from this hellhole. 

I started taking the second weeks instead of the ones labeled for this week, and level out slightly over Friday and Saturday. There’s about two days worth of the 3 mg before I woke up yesterday and said ‘fuck it. I’m done.’

I’ve been in withdrawal for the last week, and carried on, how awful could this be? Well, pretty fucking awful, but not the worst. I caved and bought some Kratom, and some low dose THC edibles, (which I’m taking very sparingly) but stopped screwing around with my diet and hydration. I’ve spent over $150 on health food the last few days, and it shows. I’ve been drinking liters of H2O all day long, and I finally pulled my head out of my ass yesterday and actually took my vitamins. Also, I put the caffeine addiction to the side, realizing my sleep is more important right now. I’m already in pain, what’s a crappy little headache the next few days? I was delighted yesterday to find I didn’t even have a caffeine headache! 

I woke up today feeling like a new person. I’m not sure if it’s the vitamins and supplements I took, or the weed, or the diet, or a combination of everything, but I feel brand new. I slept like a rock. In acute early methadone withdrawal.  Even before, in active use, taking Kratom gave my insomniac ass about three to four hours of sleep, tops, so this is a new development for me. 

The two supplements I believe helped the most with the sleeplessness, is something called ‘Magnesium Potassium Aspartate’,  and  ‘Tumeric Inflammatory Response’.  I also took a living foods multi vitamin, and probiotics. Whatever those did to me, did the trick. 

As I previously stated, I have no idea where I am with the methadone being completely out of my system, but I felt super shitty all week long, and now, 45ish hours after my last methadone dose. I feel almost perfectly fine. 

I wanted to share, and see if anyone else has had success with either of these supplements? Is there anyone on here that can give me advice, or share experiences with MAT taper and subsequent withdrawal? Any supplements or herbals that helped you? I’m trying to not take any OTC pharma crap, as I just don’t want to support it, but I’d still love to hear your experience. 
Thank you in advance.

And the paradox of addiction. How as an older man I would do almost anything to get straight.

When I was in my twenties, friends and family dragged me into rehab, literally kicking and screaming. Opiates felt good and I wanted them. But that desire brought war into my life. With everyone that didn't want me to take opiates. So you might as well say 99.9% of the world. Guess who won?

There were a lot of consequences to that struggle, some of which would not be revealed for years. Medical problems, lingering hurt feelings, words said that could not be taken back.

I grew up in the 70s when we were all about peace and love. But somehow that didn't work out very well. We still have all the corruption and small mindedness that my generation was supposed to be opposed to. The answer, my friend, was blowing in the wind. But I guess we all got deaf because not much has changed.

My view on opiates has changed. I wish I could use them on weekends, but I can't. So I am tapering off now. Apparently being a little older has made it easier, because it is not nearly the terrible, terrible fight that it once was.

My sympathies are more reserved for my other friends struggling to quit. Even with methadone, subs, etc, there are a lot of people who literally have to fight for their lives against their cravings. I wish the US would decriminalize opiates, set up injection sites and be done with the fake war on drugs. It is past the point of being ridiculous.

In the meantime, I suppose people will have to hope that science will eventually come up with a solution that everyone will be happy with. At some point, we need to quit fighting with each other.",33,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6741923}"

My friend I was using with stole from me, I decided I didnt want to live this lifestyle, and I went to IOP and got clean. Ive been clean for almost a month now, currently down to 2mg of suboxone a day.

Two weeks ago my mother found out about this, i knew she would eventually because of insurance. i really didnt want her to know, it seemed like a private personal matter and I had a group of people supporting me already, I did not need her to get involved. I am young however, I am 21, and I am still using her insurance so I knew she would know eventually. I came clean, told her everything, we cried, etc. 

This morning she called me saying she had some suspicions that she wanted to share with me. She told me that she believes I faked having an addiction so that I could get a suboxone prescription to sell it. This crushed me, not only had this thought never crossed my mind, but I would never have suspected my mom would say something like this to me. We are quite close, our relationship has been really good, we even had a mother daughter vacation planned out in two months. This came out of nowhere for me and I feel heartbroken. Im seeing my counselor and doctor today just by chance and my only hope is that he could talk to my mother or offer some kind of “proof”? It’s ridiculous that I have to provide evidence that I was suffering. Getting through this addiction was the hardest thing ive ever had to do and I am feeling so overwhelmed right now already.

i was doing H for the last two years, oxy 30s for three before that, and recently over the holidays my plugs both went to jail & i couldn’t find shit except 30s. i spent over $1000 on them in a few days trying to not be in withdrawals, but even 4-5 30s taken at once barely did anything. i already knew that was bad. than i found out my friend can get fent presses for $5-$10 fucking dollars. they are just too easy to get & a lot easier to use since i prefer to sniff shit. and BTH is a bitch to make sniff-able, even though ive used it that way for quite awhile now. 

after going through the beginning of withdrawal over the holidays, & now my tolerance being what it is, i am terrified of how i will feel if i stop doing these presses. honestly never thought in a million years that’s what i would end up doing. but i said that about H too. lol. 

anyways, i’ve been thinking about stocking up on some stuff to help me when i do decide to make the jump. i have 2 suboxone strips, & can possibly find some xanax if i look hard enough. but how do people get their hands on stuff like clonidine, gabapentin, & other prescription meds? i’ve never seen them on the street personally.  my dog takes gabapentin, but i could NEVER steal his meds lol. & unfortunately i don’t have insurance. i once had a super kind woman on here send me some gabapentin & i forget what the other stuff was, but it was so helpful when i was going through withdrawal a few years ago. thank you danielle if youre still around. 


anyway, sorry for the rant. 

basically my question is, how do you go about getting your hands on comfort meds/prescriptions like gabapentin, clonidine, benzos, etc. i don’t have insurance so i already know getting any prescription is going to be hard as fuck, but ive personally never seen these sold on the street so i’m assuming that’s the only way. 

& if i can’t get my hands on those, what other otc meds/supplements would help the most? i  know about kratom which honestly is kind of a bitch to take. and imodium definitely helps but i know that’s also not something you want to take too much of.

In the beginning it was hard of course.  Felt like there was a hole in me.  Absolutely nothing would fill that hole.  I ate a lot.  I gained 40 pounds in 6 months.  I went from being so full of energy on drugs, to practically immobile from the depression and PAWS of no drugs.  Fucking sucked.  


Finally in November I decided to hit the gym.  And holy shit after a workout I felt high.  I felt like I could climb Mt Everest.  I was in the gym every day looking for that high.  I pushed myself and got it.  I was sore everywhere, but it felt amazing.  It's been 3 months in the gym daily.  I lost 20 pounds, but I'm fucking enormous, like a tank.  I feel bulletproof, invincible.  Maybe that's a bad thing but god damn fuck it I'm gonna keep going.


I go to NA meetings twice a week.  I should probably go more.  My brain is still fucked up.  I'm aware of all my emotional issues.  I'm aware of my trust issues.  I'm aware of the fact that I am a real dickhead sometimes but I'm working on it.  NA has given me an insight into how I work.  NA has given me a network of people who get it and who I can vent all this crazy shit to.  NA has given me sober friends who truly care about me being the best me that I can.  And most of all, NA has given me accountability.  I've never had a problem letting myself down, disappointing myself, but I feel like if I use now, I'd be letting down a shit ton of people who want to see me stay clean.  If that's what helps me stay clean, I'll take it.


What a wild ride the past year has been.  I feel like I'm truly free now.  Being alive is a privilege.  As shitty as it may get, it beats the alternative.  I'm going to use the time that I have wisely and make the most out of it.  I want to help others make it through.  This disease takes no prisoners.  We are the 1%ers that make it through.

For the first time in years I am able to say with honesty, that most things in my life are going in a good direction because of changes I've made. Now I have never posted anything on social media concerning my struggles, alone any real personal matters or the emotions attached to them. I have intentionally kept anything relating to these things off of any form of social media, only allowing people I trust to know. I have my reasons, partially because I felt it unnecessary for everyone to know.

With that being said, I feel comfortable enough to share that I have finally reached a point in which I am not just barely getting by. 

Not too long ago, every day felt like a constant struggle that locked me into this depressing, almost survival like cycle consisting only of misery and deceit. After multiple years of being stuck in this cycle, I reached a certain point. A point where living in it for so long robbed me of being able to imagine living life differently. I could see all these people living more fruitfully. They were actually having fun, laughed with friends, steadily became more successful. Yet most importantly, they were able to do what they really wanted to do without being anchored by that cycle. That cycle made all these parts of life feel ""almost"" unattainable. I knew it wasn't impossible, but how things were made it so. I'm sure everyone knows that feeling when you've had enough. Now allowing yourself to see that there must be something better than this. 

A few attempts later, and an immense amount support from the ones willing to help, that fruitful life that once felt impossible to have now feels attainable. It's that feeling that allows me to believe that I can. That belief has allowed me change what needing changing, focus on things that need to be focused on, do things that feel rewarding and be proud of, and most importantly, being able to see a future for myself.

Now, finally being able to see potential in the atributes I possess, skills I've acquired, and ways I can use them to create situations that allow me to thrive. I want to thank everyone who helped me reach this point. The ones who were there through all the good times. But mostly the ones who helped me when things were bad.

God damn it, I was dead wrong. Shit kept me up ALL FUCKING NIGHT. The insomnia is indeed from my adrenal insufficiency. I should’ve known that because I was having insomnia issues while using. 

*sigh*

That’s ok. I’ve been here before and I know I’ll just continue to heal with proper self care. I have a reserve of Xanax which I will probably take advantage of to get some sleep today. Going to get some good indica, as well. I have a medical marijuana card, but being that the laws are so new in my state, dispensaries don’t exist yet. Going to have to make a phone call. Thank god he delivers. 

I started having cravings at 12:30 am and they haven’t let up. I’m in pain and I probably have maybe two functioning brain cells at the moment. I’m telling myself that using is never just a one time deal with opiates. If I pick up again, even just one pill, the floodgates will reopen. Then my fiancé will find out and want some too, thus continuing this destructive cycle. Lying to him isn’t an option, as I’m fucking horrid at it....like bad to the point that it’s comical. My fiancé literally makes fun of me when I try. Don’t worry, it’s all in good fun. It cracks me up, tbh. Plus, lying is wrong, which really goes without saying. Don’t even know why I typed that.

Also, the thought of having to deal with my drug dealer neighbor again makes me crinkle my nose in disgust and anger. I’ve spent thousands of dollars on pills from him that should’ve gone to my medical care. I should be further along in my healing process, but that’s not his fault. I know the anger I feel towards him is completely misplaced, but right now it helps keep a barrier between us, so I’ll keep it as a defense mechanism. My neighbor has no idea I feel this way.

I’m tired of supporting that morons lifestyle.

....Sorry, I need sleep. Anyway....

I need advice on some shit that happened yesterday, so if anyone has any insight, I’m all ears. My fiancé and I used together and are cleaning up together. Yesterday, he popped his head out of the kitchen and said, “I want to get a couple pills.” This was very common behavior for both of us while we were using. “Hey, wanna get some pills?” was a question we would frequently ask one another. Believe it or not, I said no, stuck to my guns and right when I thought I was going to cave, my phone dings and it’s a comment from here encouraging me to abstain. It saved me.

So, the advice part comes in here: anyone on here have any tips for situations with partners like this? Been in a relationship and cleaned up yourself? Have insight or experience? I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

Please understand that my fiancé wasn’t saying that out of malicious intent. He’s a good man. He’s supported and stood by me through all my medical shit, even worked two jobs to pay for it. He’s helped with my father and was the one who resuscitated me when I died in 2017. His heart is huge. He’s just struggling himself and probably was reaching a boiling point. We usually used on the weekends together and he feels about like one would expect to feel on day 7. 

I’m up every morning to watch the sunrise and I must say, it was truly beautiful today. The sky is clear, the birds are chirping and I can feel the cool air on my face. Feels good, man. I know if I use, this feeling will go away and I’m tired of being disengaged from life. For all the ugly bullshit, there sure is a lot of beauty. You just have to take the time to step outside yourself to notice it. 

Fuck this is a tough sentence right now......Today, I stay clean.

In the past, I once was using opiates for 2 years. I couldn't go more than a couple hours without taking more pills or I would feel the withdrawal effects. I finally entered a detox program to help. It was the worst 5 days of my life. It was so bad the drugs they gave me barely even helped, if at all...The first days were the worst, then slowly got better. I have generalized anxiety disorder and after 20 years of having access to benzos when needed, they cut me off so I had to find a naturopath that would help with my MASSIVE anxiety and sleep deprivation from coming off these drugs. So now I'm scared to go back to the people who helped with with the detox because now they won't help me with what I already needed help for. It's so f'd up to me that they would deter people from wanting to get help.

HERE IS MY CURRENT DILEMMA:

I have currently been using for 3 months skipping days here and there along the way. I am 60 hours into my detox and I've used clonidine and xanax to help and slept for the first 48 hours. This is the exact opposite as before so I'm just here super worried that the bomb is going to drop at any second. Am I waiting for the worst to come or do you think it's different because I didn't use as long, took breaks for a day or 2 every other week or so and also had those meds to help with symptoms?

Any advice would be gratefully appreciated. I feel so stupid for getting myself into this again and would have tried to stop sooner but I can't miss work so I kept putting it off until I had a long weekend off of work. Also, like I said, scared to go back and get help because they cut me off from what I need for anxiety and withdrawal makes it even worse.

2020-02-02 13:54:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ext33x/the_best_post_on_tapering_opioids_i_have_ever/,The best post on tapering opioids I have ever seen. Can potentially save people a lot of pain.,"I have been in the game a long time, and have heard all sorts of opinions about tapering off opioids. My best friend, who just got her md last year, told me that they are taught in medical school that you can taper off opioids but you are going to have a painful kick at the end, no matter how you do it. This did not jive with another friend's opinion, who is a nurse practitioner and spends a lot of time weaning infants off of opiates.

Last year I tried tapering off a gram a day of potent heroin and ended up going cold turkey because tapering simply did not seem to work. I now know I was rushing it, way too fast. In any event, below is a post made by a doctor that treats addiction and manages narcotic withdrawals. It is the best I have ever seen and was contributed by u/vbwrg. The original discussion involved the use of 150 10 mg. norcos but it applies across the spectrum.

""So, tapering using short-acting full agonists is possible (at least if the person is taking them orally), but it's not the easiest way to quit and it takes either a lot of discipline or help from someone else.

The idea behind tapering is to bring the dose down gradually enough that frank withdrawal is suppressed. You don't have a ton of Norco to work with, so your taper will be quick by necessity. A quick taper is OK with short-acting opioids (I've tapered people in 7-10 days in the hospital plenty of times) - the risk, especially when there's a history of addiction, is that the person doesn't stick to the taper and/or that they relapse on some other substance. People often think that it's only withdrawal that keeps them in the addictive cycle, but then when they're on a controlled taper or MAT, many find that their psychological dependence goes deeper than their physical dependence - that even when they have no withdrawal symptoms at all, their cravings don't automatically disappear. With a quick taper, there may be *some* withdrawal symptoms, but they will be far milder than with a cold-turkey detox.

This is why it takes either extreme discipline (which can sometimes appear when a person is *done* with opioids and when their desire for abstinence is really high) or help from someone else. If you have anyone else who could hold your Norco and dispense them as required by the taper plan, that will probably increase your chances of success. If you don't have anyone who could do that but you *do* have money, you could check and see if any of the timed medication safes or dispensers can be programmed in a way that a taper could be completed. I haven't dug into that question, but a dispenser that can only dispense pills by the same dosing schedule every day won't help you.

The conversion is a little tough when a person is using oxycodone intranasally. We don't really know what the average bioavailability is for IN oxycodone b/c there are only a few small studies that got different results. There may be inter-individual or inter-product variability, too. Since oxycodone already has high oral BA, and IN BA seems to vary from ""much lower than oral"" to ""slightly higher than oral, unless *you* can say ""it takes X amount of oral hydrocodone for me to get the same effect as 30mg IN oxycodone"" we're all guessing here a bit.

Since you're maxed out at 4g/day of Tylenol anyway (which is about 12 Norco), that's the place to start. It's also only a slight drop from my estimated conversion of your daily MME, which is about where you want to be.

Another option might be to maintain while your family is visiting (you don't say how long they'll be there) then detox when they're gone. But I think having your family there to occupy you might help you through this taper.

When a person is tapering, the goal is to reduce, as much as possible, the spikes and dips in opioid tone in their brain. The easy way to do this is to use something long-acting that maintains even blood levels. The harder way is to dose a short-acting opioid frequently enough that the peaks and troughs are leveled out. Norco usually doesn't last much longer than 4 hours in most people, so unless you get a longer effect, I wouldn't stretch it out much past that. You tell me how long it takes after a Norco for you to start craving, and I might adjust this somewhat. You have enough Norco to do a slower taper if you'd like, and you have the education to do the arithmetic to figure it out, so this is just a sample starting place:

Day 1: 12 Norco = either 1 Norco q2h (smoothest but least convenient), 1.5 Norco q3h or 2 Norco q4h.

Day 2: 9 Norco = either .75 Norco q2h, or 1.5 Norco every q4h

Day 3: 8 Norco = 1 Norco q3h

Day 4: 6 Norco = 1/2 Norco q2h, 0.75 Norco q3h, or 1 Norco q4h

(from here, I'd probably start using volumetric dosing where the fractions require it. Given your education, I'm sure you know all about that!)

Day 5: 5 Norco - 5/6 Norco q4h, or 5/8 Norco q3h, or 5/12 Norco q2h

Day 6: 4 Norco - 1/2 Norco q3h is easiest

Day 7: 3 Norco - 1/4 Norco q2h, 3/8 Norco q3h, or 1/2 Norco q4h

Day 8: 2.4 Norco - 1/5 Norco q2h, 3/10 Norco q3h, or 2/5 Norco q4h

(you can work out the rest from here - just keep reducing by 10-25% per day, depending how you tolerate it, don't spread the dosing intervals too far, and get as low as you can before jumping off).

Give the taper a try, but there's a decent chance you'll need some form of MAT. Your options are a Vivitrol shot (if you can get 7 days opioid-free) or bupe. You'll hear a lot of mixed opinions on bupe on these forums, but my experience has been that people like you (oral/nasal abusers of pharmaceuticals, with a relatively small tolerance, with financial and family support to really get their lives together) often do *really really well on bupe.* If this taper doesn't work out, please look into either detox then Vivitrol or bupe.

If you have *any* plans to try to get back into pharmacy, I'd say a blocking form of MAT is a necessity.

Besides possibly MAT, the main thing you're going to need to get off the addiction track is *something productive to occupy your time.* You're 30, and it's true your 20s are gone - but 30 is still young, and NOT too late to turn things around. It's much easier to get your life re-started at 30 than at 40. If you aren't occupied for a good portion of your day, then the boredom, free time, and crippling guilt will consume you and drive you right back to pills. It sounds like you've used opioids to blot out your shame and disappointment over being kicked out of your pharmd program. When the opioids are gone, those feelings will come back full-force, along with all the shame/guilt/disappointment over wasting your 20s, freeloading off your family, being addicted, etc.

You've already got one good outlet for that: exercise. Exercise is great for anyone coming off opioids. It gets the endorphins flowing and provides an outlet for the sympathetic overactivation you'll experience coming off opioids (clonidine helps with that too, if exercise isn't enough). Just keep an eye out that you aren't getting dehydrated. But you can't spend your entire day exercising.

It's time to decide what would make you happy - whether you'd rather build a career on your background in bio/pharmacy, or whether you'd rather do something fitness related. Sounds like the latter is your true passion, but I don't really know. Your family is doing fine running their business - I think they'd rather you do what makes you happy than work for the family business out of a misplaced sense of guilt. If you actually really *love* bio/pharm, that's a different story - but it sounds like you don't love it the way you love fitness.

Once you decide that, you find whatever job, internship, or degree program you can get. The hard part for someone like you is usually just accepting that you can't jump your way to a position commensurate with your intelligence and potential when you have a 10-year resume gap. You need to take *any* position you can get in your chosen field and *prove* that you're a good employee. Nobody may doubt your talent, but they'll still doubt that you'll have the ability to show up, do what you're told, get along with others, accept direction, etc. You're lucky in that you don't really *need* to support yourself immediately. If you can't get a paying job, get an unpaid internship or even just start volunteering. You won't make money but you'll start building your resume, getting references, and proving your value.

You're really not alone here. I've treated plenty of addicted children from highly educated, upper-middle-class, supportive families. Can't tell you how many times I've heard, ""I wish I came from a bad family so I wouldn't feel so guilty!"" The best way to leave your guilt behind is to move forward with your life and become a man that you and your family can be proud of. I have kids and grandkids - if they're doing well in the present, I don't give a fuck what anxiety or worry or heartache they caused me in the past. All that matters is that they pulled through and they're ok NOW.""",45,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50668675}"

I’m healing from post concussion syndrome (PCS). PCS can be incredibly complicated. In my case it caused organ malfunction and then failure, hormonal imbalances, balance issues and took my life back in 2017. The incident that caused my concussions took place over 14 years ago and I went untreated and misdiagnosed for 12 years until my body just couldn’t do it anymore. Finding help for this was extremely difficult and led me to leave conventional medicine altogether. I’m healing with the help from an amazing functional medicine doctor. I’m well on my way to a full recovery.

When I say misdiagnosed, I mean I was told I was bipolar along with a lot of other incorrect psychiatric disorders. This led to years of being placed on various different psych meds, none of which worked and all of them provided me with extreme negative side effects. Drs we’re constantly switching my meds. It was awful.

I usually cave on day four, but I still feel pretty strong. Part of what kept me sober yesterday is knowing that I wanted to write out day 6. 

Today’s going to be a challenge. It’s the weekend and my fiancé is off of work. We used together and weekends had a certain pattern to them that we’re both trying to break. He also has 6 days. Now is the time to modify our behavior. We just ran to the grocery store to get stuff for breakfast. It was nice to get hyped up about bacon and joke with one another again....you know, sober people shit. All that goes down the tubes when we use. Getting high together isn’t fun for either of us anymore. I’ve questioned whether we can get sober together, as it’s never worked for me in the past with a partner, but we’re stilling trying.

My drug dealer lives in my neighborhood. It’s not an ideal situation, but we plan on moving soon. Moving won’t ultimately fix the problem as the change to get sober comes from within. No matter where we move, they’ll be access to opiates somehow. I can sniff that shit out like a well trained drug dog.

Yesterday was a god damned nightmare. Had to hop back on dads hospice train when I called his nurse to check on his progress with the new meds. Turns out, the head of hospice decided to switch dads nurse and not inform anyone. His now old nurse had to tell me. Consistency with my step mom and dad is so crucial, especially with my step mom. She has senile dementia and several traumatic brain injuries. She’s fired previous home health care companies for less. Then, my dying father is literally left without proper care, gets overwhelmed and violent. Needless to say, I was livid and I made sure to properly ream the hospice dude. There was a very positive relationship between my family and dads old nurse. I’m pretty pissed that it was discarded so easily. 

As you can imagine, my step mom isn’t great with money, but that didn’t stop her from calling and asking my brother and sister for 10k yesterday. She needs it for a down payment on a house that she ultimately can’t afford. She’s blaming my fathers credit for the financial problems they’re experiencing. I should add that she’s been managing the money since they got married and has taken out loans and credit cards in my dads name. My sister and I spoke for a couple hours yesterday. I just listened as she fumed about it. 

Fuck me running. 

This is where I embrace the concept of acceptance. So much of this is out of my control. Meditated on the topic after the dust settled and felt much better.

Basically I have been on H for about a year and a half now after transitioning from Percocet because I was a naive young adult who thought I could control this... WRONG , so my tolerance recently reached up to 20-30 bags a day nasally , and that’s where I realized that .. I messed up and can’t do this anymore this is my breaking point I can’t even afford it at that rate and I want to stop before it’s too late. I have seen so many peoples stories on here and it is so inspiring how strong you guys are it gives me hope ! I know my habit is quite “short”  and “light” compared to some but I’m a 21 year old with no support system no way of getting real medical help and I just feel very very alone and very scared. I have cut back this week I am down to 7-10 bags a day so far and I’m determined to get to even 1 bag a day in 2 days hoping maybe it will make it even a bit easier?? I was able to find some subs but I only have 2 strips , one 13mg and one 8mg and I don’t know what to do ! In a perfect world I would like to not even use them and get through this and not prolong the process but I just need any kind of advice or even your own stories/experiences.. anything at all would bring me such joy knowing there’s other humans on the other side of their screens replying to me ! I researched compulsively for months and I purchased a huge bag of vitamin C powder , and  tomorrow I am planning on buying a huge list of vitamins I saw on a previous post about how it helped that person immensely! I just have never done this before ever , have no one to talk to , live alone with my dog and really just need anything you can tell me ? Can I do this ? I want this soooo bad just am I safe to do this is it a bad idea?? Any kind of medical/rehab/meeting type thing is out of the question for me as I live in the middle of nowhere and can’t afford it and like I said absolutely nobody knows about this and I just want to get through this , learn my hard lesson and put it behind me , I’m just very alone and very scared it even relieves me to type this out as I never even could imagine saying this out loud or to anybody at all , I’m young n dumb and I made the stupidest choice but I can’t go back in time and the only way out is through. Also if anyone could tell me their experiences with subs or if necessary that I should even use them? I was thinking to cut them up to 1mg strips and try to just use them in case of emergency (after 24 hours). What do u guys think or even just a sentence of encouragement idk ... I just need a outlet and this is my only option . Thank you so much if you read this far into this venting post and I thank anyone that responds from the bottom of my heart because ... I really need it right now.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4224433}"
