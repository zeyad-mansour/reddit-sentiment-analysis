I am almost 2 weeks from my last usage. However I used subs to taper symptoms. It’s been over 3 days since I last used subs. And I basically did a rapid taper 4 mg down to .5 mg so I barely used any. 

I used for a year and a half, pills then nasally H. 

Do any of you guys have RLS permanently now? If not, how long it take to regain normal feeling in arms and legs?

I ride bike/cross fit stuff. It helps with my mood swings and to take my mind off cravings and for natural endorphins. I know over exercising can flare up RLS. 

My main concern is that it’s not permanent.",2,0

I had a bottle of wine and I was like I hate booze. I think when I was on methadone that two drinks got me trashed and I didn't like that. So I cracked it and had a glass, boom brain fizzies are gone. Now the wine is gone 3 days later. 

I have seen many opiate addicts turn to maintenance alcoholism. I don't want to, but the brain fizzies, the uncomfortable feeling disappears. Just a sip or two. 

When I had a few mouthfuls I was almost me. It kind of scares the shit out of me. Being addicted to an illegal drug is one thing, but I make my own wine. Booze is everywhere.

I'm hoping my quit won't be that tough (it's not my first rodeo) since I've tapered down to .25 a day and I smoke. As I've kicked many, many times before, I've got a nice prep plan - got some gabapentin, immodium (small dose), and a muscle relaxer. Planning on exercising, staying busy & active, eating healthy, drinking tons of water, vitamins, etc etc.

This time, however, I stumbled upon 6 subs. It's orange M N8 imprint. I've read what feels like every thread in this sub over the years, and have read many stories about PWD and really, I'm planning on not even taking these things - certainly not within 24 hours of my last dose, and probably 48 hours just to be sure since I've heard the horror stories of PWD and don't want none of that. 

But does anyone have any advice for me here?   
Should I just trash these, or might they save my ass if on Day 3 or 4 I'm feeling like relapsing and take one of these instead?   
Does it even work like that (i.e. will it provide quick relief or do I have to build it up in my system?)  
On Day 3 (normally my worst day) if I'm feeling like I'm going to call the dboy, would it be wise to take half of this pill? A whole one? A small piece?   
Should I do a micro dose first to make sure I'm not allergic?  
Any other advice / words of encouragement?

I feel amazing, almost like my pre-drug self. I was on heroin for about 4 years off and on. The last 2 of those years being IV. I got on Suboxone (Zubsilv) and stayed on that for 2 years. I was getting tired of the ups and downs with it. I pretty much had to take a small piece in order to be mildly happy in social situations or pretty much anything where I actually had to engage in something. My Dr. recommended the shot and I agreed after reading the great reviews. 
The shot hurts. It doesn't look like it will but it does, for a bit. I believe its a 12g needle and it injects a goo into your abdomen. Its all good until they start pushing the drug in. 
Anyway, I feel wonderful....i haven't felt a craving to dose more at all. It was a little hard to sleep last night because my mind wouldn't slow down but I'm sure ill sleep great tonight.

My plan with my Doc at the moment is to get 2 more shots, 300/100mg and then see where we are after that. If those 2 shots do it and I never have to get another one or take another Zubsolv again then we will be happy. My Doc STRONGLY recommends Sublovade for anyone that wants to get off and is not against a VERY slow taper.

With almost no support because covid -19 I feel completely lost.  

My wife and son are my entire world and it fucking tears me apart to let them down like this... they deserve better and so do I.

All of my friends and I had to grow up at a young age, 10 for me. I’ve always been told I’m an old soul and that I’m very mature for my age. I was held back a year in school so all of my friends are younger than me. One of my best friends(16F) has an abusive father and a complacent mother. My best friend did heroin for the second time today. Now, we all smoke and drink, every teenager does. I just moved back to my home state in November of 2019, I had been gone for 2 years, visiting only in the summer. My friend was always an outcast but still popular. Very popular with the guys. Her family has a long history of addiction and alcoholism. As well as a myriad of different mental disorders. She most definitely has depression and I believe something more. So when I moved back, we went to a party and she told me how she has started doing cocaine. I was worried for her but I wasn’t phased by it. I was almost ready to do it with her but I didn’t. That was in December 2019. She told me it was only at parties and she wasn’t addicted. She never bought it and did it at home or anything. Then in March she started doing Xanax. I had to take care of her when she did 2 bars and then drink 2 glasses of wine without telling us what she was on. During this, she nodded off with the wine glass in her hand and hit her head on the corner of a dresser and cut her forehead open on the wine glass. Her mom saw what had happened and naturally we covered for her and told her mom that she fell over a bag of clothes on the floor and hit her head. Her mom believed she had a concussion. I wouldn’t doubt it at all. That was a very scary experience for me... I never thought I’d see her like that. In about February she started dating an- at the time- recovering drug addict. He(19M) was in rehab with no intention of recovering or staying clean. They started hanging out, doing coke at each other’s houses, he went to her house with a crack pipe burn on his lip, every time they argue he shoots up heroin and blames it on her. One of our mutual friends (15F) told me tonight that our she had gone to his house and done heroin and smoked crack. Tonight she was snap chatting us after coming home from his house and we knew she was on something, when we asked, it was heroin. For the second time, other than the 2 times she she snorted synthetic heroin. We are all so worried for her, and I told her that. I told her I want to help her but I’m not so sure how. I can’t tell her parents, her father will just beat on her and tell her how she is a horrible daughter and he wishes she was never born. Her mom will be too scared and let it happen. All of her other family lives in a different state. I’d recommend rehab but again, her parents wouldn’t pay. They are a wealthy, well off family too. I’m just so afraid for her. She is going down a horrible path. I love her like a sister. It doesn’t help that she’s generally secretive and doesn’t talk about things until awhile after they have happened. What can I do for her? What should I do? I need some advice on how to help her.",2,0

This is my first intentionally anonymous account.  I think it's time for me to reach out to find help as I am really struggling.  I don't intend this to be a long post, but I just need to know how some of you found ways to replace the addict part of your life.  I'm on day three of a 60-90mg/day pressed oxy habit (pressed with fent).  Back in December I ODd from taking to much after going sober for a few months.  It nearly killed me.  Woke up in the hospital after being rushed there unconscious and blue in the face.  The doctors all told me I was extremely lucky to be alive given that I was basically dead for about 8 hours before my roommate found me.  Apparently I also experienced a small stroke through it all (which confused the doctors as I'm only 26), but I lucked out there with no long term effects.  

That all being said I still relapsed.  I started using again mid-January and have continued until this past weekend.  I sobered up this weekend and am on day three and fortunately my withdrawals were mild in comparison to some here, but I could care less about the dopesickness.  I'm really worried about PAWS.  What I really need to do is find some kind of passion or ANYTHING to grab my interest more than those stupid blue pills.  The problem is nothing interests me.  I used to work on music, but I was never good enough to be great and was too hard on myself so I quit.  I don't have anything to look forward to, nothing interests me, and work is a way to make money, but not something I'm passionate about.  PAWS has screwed me over before and it's going to happen again unless I can figure something out.  Can anyone here help guide me or give me their experience?  I don't really have anyone I can tell or anyone I want to burden/scare with my problem.  Especially since I look like a fucking idiot for returning to the thing that nearly took my life at 26.

My wife and two of my kids revived me with two doses of Narcane and CPR.   Coming back into consciousness and understanding what I had done was the worst nightmare I’ve had.  Sadly I have probably OD’d six times since OxyContin came onto the scene.

Three days after my OD, a friend tells me that he heard I was dead from an overdose.  To my knowledge, not many people were aware that I battled a painkiller addiction (my OxyContin use was not well known).  It turns out my wife suspected the wrong friend of mine for giving me fentanyl and texts him that I was being taken to a morgue and she informed the police she knew that I got the fentanyl from him.  He’s dealt coke for twenty years and only small time and to long term acquaintances.  I consider him a friend.  But just a friend who parties like I do now and then.  I like to share a meal or an occasional baseball game (he provides our family with tickets through his work.

Mom has the kids tipping their spears toward me for any little reason.  I know I messed up.  I hadn’t even smoked a quarter of a fentanyl patch.  But in an instant being clean 3.5 years clean was not an achievement.  I don’t expect a medal or gold watch.  

The COVID pandemic has been minimal stress to me.  I was always there for my kids.  Sometimes I was high.  But they enjoyed vacationing, skiing, biking, horse riding and every damn iPhone and iMac invented.

I am sure the court of public opinion has holds me as selfish right now.  Yes they my family doesn’t deserve to worry about their dad.  The petty bullshit she and my kids are giving me is overwhelming during this quarantine.

My wife is a manipulative and vengeful person but I still love her when she spares us her bring downs.   I know I’ll, make it another 3.5 years clean.   We’ve been married for over twenty years.

So on June 5 2013 I went to rehab for 120 days in TN and had 5.5 years clean from opiates. I still drank and smoked weed but did neither in excess. During that time I opened up a recording studio and started a band called Bishop Gunn. In 2019 we toured the world hitting 15 Countries and opened for Incredible bands like The Rolling Stones, Guns N Roses, etc.. everything was great. However in October 2019 I got prescribed some cough syrup for a nasty cough. It had codiene in it but i thought it was fine, I’d been clean so long and justified it because the cough was terrible. However it’s like it started up my addiction “jet engines” and before I knew it I was entering into a full blown withdrawal. During this time I have found who I think is the love of my life. We have been together for almost 2 years now. Anyway, by January 1st I admitted I had been using to her and checked myself into a 7 day detox program and got on Suboxone. I went until about mid February and she was being very supportive but for some reason I relapsed again, even tho I honestly didn’t want too. This relapse only lasted about week. She was still very supportive and I got back on my subs and made it about another month and relapsed again.. this time for like 3 weeks. And this time was to fentanyl presses roxies. She had no idea. So one day I decided this can’t continue so I waited a while then took my meds and went Into PWD. Obviously I couldn’t hide that as it was TERRIBLE. I was fucked. Literally rolling around In bed, could hardly talk, the whole 9. So her and her friend thought I was dying and called an ambulance. Went to the ER and they just gave me fluids and after a while let me go. 

Anyway, she wants me to get help. Like inpatient.. however all the state facility’s are full and my insurance doesn’t cover addiction stuff. All this happened about three weeks ago, and by the way I’m back on my subs and honestly I feel more stable then any previous attempt recently. It was so scary this last time how quickly it got out of hand and I also almost lost the love of my life even tho I would much rather have her and our family then use. But that little voice is a sneaky powerful little MF’er. Anyway, today she gave me an ultimatum.. get treatment or get out of the house. I’ve been trying to find a way but I just don’t have the recourses right now. Also, I’ve been looking into outpatient as that is a lot more affordable but she thinks I need to go somewhere for a while and not be here (home) until I have some time under my belt. 

I know I’m rambling I am just trying to explain the background. Anyway, what should i do? Anyone been in a similar situation? Also what has helped y’all stay sober? How can I save myself while at the same time save our relationship? I honestly don’t want to use and I want this relationship. She is incredibly special. Any advice will be greatly appreciated!",2,0

Had a really good day yesterday.  The guilt and sadness I felt on day 1, and 2 were not as bad today.  Started my day with a 3.2 km slow jog then walked another 2km.  Took my daughter to my old hometown and showed her all the places I used to play and lived. I'm sure she was bored but she amused me anyway. Also stopped by my best friend's house and had a 10 minute driveway social distanced meeting.  Have not seen him since pandemic started. 

Played catch with my boy after I got home.   At 8pm I was a bit restless so I smoked a bit of thc vape. That relaxed me enough to go to bed at 930.  Slept til 430.  Up and had a coffee. 

I'm feeling great about my decision to quit opiates.   I can allready see what a burden opiates were to my life.  I could never enjoy the moment because I felt guilty all the time.  I knew I was letting down my loved ones but they had no idea. Really enjoyed my day yesterday.   

I have so much energy.   I have to stay busy.  It's crazy that a three year full blown habit of gradually building up to 140mg a day of oxycodone did not cause my more physical withdrawals. I'm very lucky.  Minor chills.  I dont have my full endurance when exercising but I am getting stronger every day.  I know people with half the habit I had that cant get out of bed for a week.   I'm truly lucky. 

Never going back.  Tonight at 11pm will mark 4 complete days of sobriety from opiates. Feels good to wake up without the opiate hangover and anxiety that can only be cured by more opiates. 

My original plan was to start Wellbutrin today but I think I may wait. I know PAWS will hit at some point but if I can get through this without medication ( not counting small amounts of THC)  then so be it.",7,1

So a little about me, I’m 29.  Started doing pain pills back in 07. Eventually after about 5 years I transitioned into heroin. I guess it’s a typical story, lost my kids, lost my home, car, job, self worth, and sold anything I could to get high. I had sex with dealers for dope or whoever had dope. God, I’m so happy my life isn’t there anymore. But I got clean back on March 7 2018. Basically, I was able to get my kids, and I instantly overdosed in front of them. So things got a little more serious. I felt even worse than I already did. So I had a homeless friend in Denver and he said if I could get out there, we could split a hotel room. I’m in Indianapolis. So my dad bought me a bus ticket, my mom gave me 200$ for food to survive on and get me through til I get a job out there. Obviously I spent that money on dope and did it all the night before I hopped on the bus. It was the scariest thing I ever did. I remember being on a layover in Iowa in the middle of nowhere, at a bus station, and I started bawling my eyes out.  I thought, oh my god what have I done? This is a terrible idea!!  Well things worked out. I spent about a year being homeless out there. Then I came back to Indianapolis and I’ve been here for a year now too. My friend that saved my life, he stayed in Denver. Last fall he got hit by a god damn car walking to work, and he died. Fuckin broke my heart. 

Anyway, I just feel like sharing lately. I’m curious how other people finally got clean. My 2 bffs took different routes. One was in prison for about 2 years, the other stayed here and isolated. The latter finally quit because our friend died of endocarditis when delivering her second kid.

I got you. ❤","So, my son (21) is currently in rehab. Again. We fought for him to get out of prison bc of this whole virus. He had been awaiting in patient rehab, but no one was accepting new patients at that time due to the same. So, we brought him home. Gave him naltrexone every day, and crossed our fingers he would stay well. 

Two weeks later, he overdosed. I had to hit him with three doses of narcan to bring him back. This isn't the first time. I don't even want to reflect on how many, it'll make me cry. He's been in the hospital in the ICU before with Rhabdomyolysis. So bad, at 20 years old he was on dialysis, and they were discussing kidney transplants. Miraculously he bounced back. And entered his first, of many, in patient, rehabs. 

So many of his friends who are/were also lost in addiction praise us for always being there for him. Bc most of their parents aren't great. And don't care. So, I try and do what I can to help them as well. My mom was, and is an addict. I've been totally estranged from her for years. I know what kind of awful pain that is to not have the support of a parent.  I'm so lost as to what to do for him. My brain is probably broken from all the stress of seeing him almost die so many times. The way someone looks when they overdose...it's awful. And for that someone to be your baby boy? It's beyond description. I'm only 40 and I feel like I'm 100. That said, I keep just compartmentalizing. I keep moving. I have another son (14) who needs taking care of, and is I'm sure, emotionally damaged from this as well. 

So, I come on here. It gives me hope to see so many success stories. But also, I can try to give you guys an ear, or encouraging words. I can't help my son right now, but if I can be some sort of support for someone else, I would be grateful for it. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. ❤

This is my first post on here. I don’t know who else to ask. For some context, I’ve been addicted to weed and periodically psychologically addicted to acid for the last year or so. Since the beginning of this year I’ve become dependent on morphine twice. I took kratom to get out of wd both times, but it just turned into its own addiction. I also had a few stints with dxm and phenibut, but of course I prefer opioids over all else. A few weeks ago I went back to acid looking for some answers and found that it only heightened the sadness/pain. I’ve been taking tramadol that I stole from my parents for the last two weeks and during that time also relapsed once on morphine. 

During these last two weeks, the time I spend not on drugs has become increasingly unbearable. I cry if I’m not high. I’ve reached out to two plugs looking for more pills or even h, but thank god it hasn’t worked out yet. I know I’m out of control, but I’ve been unhappy for so long (I suspect a combination of undiagnosed ocd/anxiety/depression), and I’m so incredibly alone, so hopeless. I never want to go back to how I felt before I found drugs.

My use has already had all the usual negative consequences: lost nearly all my friends, my relationship with my parents quickly devolved, hooked up with people I might not have “normally” hooked up with and said things I might have never said. I’m sure I’ve embarrassed myself more than a few times being really high when I shouldn’t be. I fell slightly behind in my classes for a little bit (I just finished my first year of undergrad). 

You might think that after all this shit I would realize that now is the time to turn back, but really it’s just taught me what I need to do, how to hide that I’m going through wd, how to get money from people, etc. I know that this is a terrible path to take, and that it will only bring more sadness and pain and death. But I’m already in this, I’m already this far, why not just try h or opium or something stronger than what I have already done. In my head I think I’ll be satisfied after one try, but I realize that‘s not how it’s gonna be. The state of my world and the world at large is just so hopeless, why not become a serious opioid addict? All I can think about is how sad I am and what I’m gonna take next.
 
For the last few weeks I’ve been able to talk to a social worker through my university, and it’s been somewhat helpful just to be able to talk to someone honestly for one hour once a week (no one in my life really knows the full extent of my addiction). But since the semester is over now, we can only meet one more time. I’m supposed to find myself a therapist, which I tried to do before with no luck. In less than a week I will once again be really, seriously alone.

I always see people saying that the addict has to be the one to end the cycle of addiction, that it has to be my decision, but if I have the choice I’ll choose the drug. My thoughts about drugs are intrusive and uncontrollable. How am I ever supposed to help myself? It doesn’t seem possible or worth it, especially when I know how likely it is that I’ll eventually relapse, if not tomorrow then a year from now or a decade. Then what was this all for? Drugs are something I’ll always want.

tldr: Drugs have already caused me a lot of pain, but I’m never gonna not want to be an addict.

If you read it all, thank you. I will take any and all advice. Anything.",3,0

I was tryna make a consistent habit of commenting on at least like 5 posts a day so I'm not just here rambling my ass off in the check in and that's all, but I've had a lot of school work lately and been trying to put my phone in another room all together and stay away from its distraction. I have been pretty productive this last week though which is always a good feeling.  

I broke up with R though you guys!!! I did it I actually did it!!! I couldn't have done it without the help of a certain redditor on here who I started out just bullshitting with but have become really good friends with, he helped me just really see things from an objective perspective and see how bad things really were.  

I'd be lying if I said breaking up with him hasn't been on my mind for honestly the last few months. There's so much stuff I purposely didn't mention on here because I was so embarrassed. Not physical abuse, but just extremely shitty stuff. There was just that last mental bastion of being scared of being alone I had to push though and I somehow did it. It really is my last addiction to kick (weeell we've got nicotine but we'll give that one a few years lol), like being so codependent on people who are fucking awful to and for me. But I feel like if I was able to better my life and myself so much in this last year while I was still dating him and dealing with his bullshit, imagine what I could do without that dragging me down.  

I just have this really excited feeling and absolutely zero desire to get into any future romantic interactions at all (in the near future that is, it's not like im tryna die alone like no ofc one day I'll be open to dating again but its gonna be a few years). I haven't felt like this since 2014 when I broke up with my ex that I rode trains with and actually spent a whole year single and had the best damn year of my life. And even then I was still not fully over needing to be like with someone else, idk. But the last 10 years I've spent like 1.5 years out of that single and not even all at once. I mean I feel like I've had to be on my own emotionally for ages anyway so it's not even like much is changing.  

He is still gonna be staying here for the time being what with the lockdown..  I may be done w dating him but I'm not going to kick him out on the streets in the middle of a global pandemic with literally nowhere to go. We have a second bedroom so yesterday we went to Walmart and went grocery shopping and he got a TV for that room and we agreed we wouldn't like divide up food and would still eat some meals together just out of convenience. And honestly I feel like now the whole pressure to have a relationship and have everything perfect is gone our interactions are substantially better. I even stood at his door last night as he showed me some dumb (in a good way) video and we laughed about it. I never thought I would be the kind of person able to live with her ex but honestly its totally fine and I gotta admit I do still like the security of just knowing there is another person in the house.  

Oh and totally random but I also got into a full headstand with nearly perfect alignment and held it for 20 seconds yesterday which I have never even attempted before so I was fucking stoked!! I don't even know who I am anymore im legit obsessive over yoga and like peacefully cohabiting with my ex? Who tf is this bitch? Idk but I think I like her lol.  

Well lemme wrap this up. Hope everyone else is doing alright! I heard on the radio yesterday Georgia is starting to reopen and as much as emotionally I would love for things to get back to normal, logically and rationally that seems like a reaaally bad idea. Literally everyone I saw out yesterday was wearing a mask so I'm glad at least the large majority of ppl in my state seem to be taking this fairly serious. What are things like in y'all's states? Do you agree with the quick reopening or think a slow and steady approach might be better?  Either way hope y'all are staying safe and hanging in there. Happy Saturday, love y'all! 💜",5,3

The next day you discard 2ml, 3rd day 3ml etc.  If I experience any WD symptoms, they say hold til stabilized, then resume at last dose.  Or I could remove .50ml and discard for a 5% taper.

Does this sound feasible?  I went from 5-325 hydrocodone, to 10-325 hydrocodone, to 10mg oxy over the past at least 6yrs.

I’m not in the best place financially and can’t say I have my life together but I am sober and working on it. I have a little brother whose a year and a half younger than me who I was extremely close with growing up. He stopped talking to me while I was using and has expressed sentiments along the lines of that I’m a fuck up and will always be so, and that he wants nothing to do with me. I thought that if I got clean and changed my life around he would start talking to me again but that has not happened. He still wants nothing to do with me even if I’m clean. He does not speak to me at all or even acknowledge my existence. I’ve tried to reach out apologize and mend things but he’s made it clear he has no interest in doing so and never will. Obviously this is very hurtful and extremely hard for me to understand or deal with. I try to pretend like I don’t care and that it doesn’t bother me but the truth is I love my brother and would give anything to have him back in my life. He’s not a particular empathetic person and is also very stubborn so I realize that probably won’t ever happen at this point but any time I think about it I get so depressed. At times even angry and spiteful. And to be honest with you guys I’m tired of carrying that hurt and anger around all the tine, it’s exhausting mentally and emotionally.

My brother whom I live with has struggled with an opioid addiction since we were teenagers. We’re now in our late 20’s and have been roommates for a few years. I initially invited him to live with me and my girlfriend some time ago to get him out of my parents house while still being able to keep an eye on him, so to speak. 

For the most part he does well from what I can tell in terms of avoiding opioids for the last few years, with a few hick ups here and there that have been addressed and we seemed to be past. He started dating a girl in the last year that he met in drug court after being arrested with heroine, and she seems really good for him and truly has his best interest at heart as someone who understands opioid addiction. 

Tonight she came over unannounced because she suspected something was wrong after not hearing from him for a while. I let her in, she went in his room and started screaming. He had overdosed and was unresponsive. I ran in, we called rescue and I tried desperately to wake him up. After what felt like an eternity, he started to respond slowly. Paramedics checked him out, told me to keep an eye on him and left. To say I’m feeling a lot of things is an understatement. Above all, I’m worried. I always worry about him. But I didn’t know he was back up to this. If not for his girlfriend getting a funny feeling, I don’t think he would have made it out of this one. 

I don’t know what to do. He has been struggling with this for a very long time. I don’t know where to even start to get him help on this. I know he wants to get away from it but it seems to sneak back up on him every year or so. I’m not sure what to do. Any advice for where to start in trying to help him?


TLDR; I live with my brother who’s been an addict for years. I thought he had been clean for some time until he overdosed tonight. He survived but I don’t know what the next step should be or how to go about getting him help. There have been several attempts but nothing seems to stick with him.",1,0

I'm seven months sober. Have only relapsed once in 18 months.

This time around I dug myself out of true homelessness and I was likely near death.
I've recently gotten my daughter back in my life.

This is my first time posting on Reddit. I would love some advice, wisdom, or overall hope in getting off Suboxone. I hate that I was even prescribed it anyway as at the time, I did not know what it was fully. I was over taking pills for about 2 months and then decided to get sober off them so went to see an addiction doc. He immediately put me on it and since I was about to go to work and had a young baby, I jumped at taking it. It worked well! I have never abused it and work a 12 step program. I have been on Suboxone for about 2.5 years now. I take about 3 mg. My doc always drug tests me when I come in but due to the virus, we are doing telemedicine appts. Well, apparently they called me and told me to come in for a drug test and I swear I never got the message. Anyway, because of that my doc did not take my appt today and I’m out of med! I have to wait until at least Monday or Tuesday and I’m scared as I’m out. Also, I’m so over this medication and want to get all the way off. I’m motivated and over being chained to ultimately another opiate. My plan was to taper to 1 mg or less and then make the leap. Should I just try and stop now or get through this the weekend and get to the doc Monday? I’m scared about withdrawal the next few days until I can get my script refilled finally. I would love to just get off now but can’t afford to be sick. I have a 2.5 year old, 7 month old, and full time job working from home with the kids here. If you have read this far and have any advice or suggestions, let me know. :) Im sad today that I’m even in this mess in the first place. I hope everyone is safe, healthy, happy, and well. 🌸",4,1

Kept the addiction in check for a couple of years but once I found a hook up for oxycontin I was in trouble.   At my peak i was taking 160mg per day ..   I'd quit for 2-4 days then start up again.. i finally quit in 2016. Quit for over a year, but started again.  Kept my usage to just 20mg at a time.   Kept it there for about a year hut you know how it goes.   As of yesterday I was back up to 140mg a day. 

I'm lucky that I dont really get bad physical withdrawals.  Some sadness for a couple of days , and some chills but that's it.  I attribute that to intense exercise right away.    

I'm quitting for gd this time.  I broke down and told my wife today .  I cried like a kid. She is really good about it.  I feel so good that I told her.  It has given me some extra strength.    This is too hard to do on my own.  

The guilt and sadness are the hardest thing.  But by telling my wife it has allowed me to forgive myself.

Well anyways someone who I've looked up to for years in NA and AA just died last night from the Corona virus and kinda sucks. He's known people in my family since he was in High School. Helped me get 2 years sober from when I was 21-23 then I went back in and out for 4-5 years and when I came back there he was to help again and now I have about 8 months. He was very kind and understanding but would always tell it as it is never saying what you wanted to hear but the truth on matters. He was honest to a fault. Was always trying to get new comers and myself to take and follow advice. And helped a great many people get and stay sober and enter a life of recovery.

I know he will be greatly missed and impacted a large number of lives for the better. At this point I hope I can go to his funeral since I knew his sons from HS and other activities they and me and my dad did together. Just now I want more than ever to live a life like he did and honor all that service he did voluntarily for other addicts.

I've fucked up and have put myself in the same predicament that we have all been in; my ""one time relapse"" has turned into a ~4 month run. I must admit it's not my longest, but id like to take care of this shit before it gets out of control. 

Quick background (I won't go all the way back as I've been on and off opiates for ~10 years with my longest stretch opifree being 2 years): I spent Christmas of '18 in a rehab facility. During that time my fiance left me and that really fucked me up. I got out and while still upset I pushed through with the hopes I could stay on the right track and she'd give me my 1,000,000th chance (spoiler alert - she didn't).

Fast forward to this past holiday season - I got extremely depressed. I beat myself up over losing my ex and fell into a really, really dark depression. I began pushing the few friends I still had at the time away and really isolated myself. 

Got in touch with a buddy who had some pharmaceuticals and figured why not, it's been so long I got this (I should've know better. We all know how that ends). Managed to do it sporadically up until after Christmas. By then the frequency increased and by sometime in Jan/Feb I was using about 3 times a week. 

The past month and a half or so it's been almost daily. I've tried to keep it as far apart as I can to minimize the withdrawals as much as possible but who knows. 

In the scheme of things this isn't my worst run nor the longest/most consistent but I'm sure it will by no means be comfortable. 

There was few other very difficult/heartbreaking events scattered in there but at this point it's water under the bridge and I have to get passed it. I guess my whole point of this post is to just put it into the universe because I haven't really admitted this out loud. I have some kratom, about 50 marijuana edibles, and go back to work on Monday so im making the attempt. This is the furthest thing from my first time, but any help would be appreciated. As well as any tips/suggestions to help me get over this breakup because quite honestly that's where all of my pain/depression/unhappiness and whatever else issues stems from. 

Any input, kind words, suggestions, or anything would be greatly appreciated because I REALLY don't want to go to rehab with this outbreak nor do I really want to just try to sustain my addiction and hit a facility when this is all over.

What I’m understanding is that everyone’s withdrawals are different. I’ve been taking Tramadol for 7 years almost daily.  100-300mg. But usually 200.  I had a script for 120 50mg/month.  I had macular migraines at first but then I used them to workout more/harder. I’m late 40’s wife and mom who is as normal  as they come. Friends and family would be shocked so I’m hoping to do this privately.  My doc says no more. Referred me to pain management but not sure I’ll go.  Having to see my doc every month (and her judging eye🙄) gave me anxiety was bad enough.  I have about 90 pills left to taper off from and hopefully avoid major lethargic withdrawals.  I believe that mentally, we can do anything we want to. But I’m scared I wont be the physical powerhouse I was.  Ran miles, worked out 2 hours 6 days a week.  Lots of energy. And yeah, I wouldn’t be stopping if she didn’t say no.  I love the feeling that Tramadol gives me.  Yesterday i was hoping to not take any (haven’t skipped a day in years) but my low mood and sluggishness got the better of me so I took 100mg around 1 pm.  (That was actually a partial victory since I usually wake up and immediately take 100-200). I felt good.  Much better than on rare occasions I only took 2.

I’m curious what’s everyone’s opinion are for how long it takes if ever to get to a point where you’re able to use sporadically as needed for acute pain?

So I was on last week about a codeine addiction and I cut down significantly- went to 4 a day for 12 days. Then got the pregabalin script. Took no codeine since Sunday- first time not having codeine for 4 years and the plan was to use the gabo as phase 2 of my detox- I'm in day 3 of that but of course I didn't stick to the dose and was just popping them away...Am I screwed?? I was hoping if I got to Friday the codeine at least would be out of my system and I've done the gabo on a once off loads of time so I know there ll just be a bit of a come down with that. I'm connected to my program (as best I can today) and keep reaching for the codeine but I'm not giving in to that. Have I ruined everything? Feel like crap😥 I've abstained from alcohol and  coke for 7 years with my program what the fuck is wrong with me like. Lonely Irish girl,2,0

Hello everyone, tonight at midnight will be 1 week clean for me after abusing oxycodone for 6 months.

I’m feeling better everyday, but I had a thought last night that has shaken me to my core.

I’m supposed to start work on April 30th (might be pushed back again due to the COVID-19) and I am terrified that I won’t be able to keep up with my jobs requirements (Not too hard, but I walk 12 miles a day). By the time I start, I’ll have been clean for 16 days or longer. 

Can someone please just let me know that I’m going to be okay and I’ll be feeling up to it by the time I have to go back to work? Please, anything for relief of my anxiety. I can’t lose this job, I tell myself I’ll be okay but with low quality sleep and working long hours I’m just so scared. Someone please give me your input I am desperate.",3,1

I have been a fairly long term lurker on this sub for about a year and it’s really helped me through a lot of internal struggle dealing with opiates. 

My background with opiates...started off taking Percocet 10mg about a year ago. Really mild use here and there. Was able to discontinue use weeks at a time with no problems. Eventually it led to around a 60mg/day habit. That lasted about 8 months or so until the connect got cut off. Ended up withdrawing for about 5 days. Was rough, but I made it out. Unfortunately no one knows, so I had to play it off like the flu and damn, keeping to yourself is difficult. Almost makes the anxiety worse. Eventually started Kratom, on day 6. Dumb decision, but didn’t realize at the time, that I was pretty much in the clear. The kratom use was minimal. Couple grams here and there every few hours. This was quality Kratom from an online vendor. My tolerance slowly built, but after a couple months the original pill connect was getting 10mg hydros. I end up taking 70-80mg for a couple days, then jumping to lower quality Kratom for weeks at a time. The quality is def. noticeably weaker than the online kratom I’ve got in the past, but it alleviated all WDs from the hydro, if I was even having any. Stupid, I know.  Ive been repeating that process a handful of times and pretty much brings me to my current situation. Ive used low grade kratom, 10gpd for two weeks, and then 75mg hydros for the last four days. I’m out right now and I am so done with this kind of life. I have a family that I need to focus on that love me dearly. I don’t need to be strung out in the grips of addiction. I know I can do it, but my question is...Should I CT off of the hydros right now, or jump back on kratom and taper down for a couple weeks? I feel I can taper with the kratom, but not sure how hard the hydro/kratom WD is going to hit me if I CT? I’ve been alternating the two for around 4 months. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions and advice. I just want to feel normal again and be happy and sober.",1,0

I was just a social hatchling before the quarantine occurred, seeing as I had relocated to a new town upon my July release from prison in 2018, a transplant away from all the negative influences that surrounded me. 

I progressed physically, emotionally, and financially these last few years but I am still lacking. I haven't invested myself in a loving relationship in the better part of a decade, because I am an emotional toddler when it comes to developing positive relationships. I feel like I should have so much to show for my time on this earth but it seems my past self wanted to squander everything.

All the excess time has allowed me to turn on myself once again. You aren't tall enough, standing at five foot eight, to get a decent looking woman I tell myself. I shield myself from rejection and doom myself to loneliness even longer.

Financially I am out of the red and into the black. Alongside the color change my credit is headed into the green for the first time in at least five years, however there is a caveat; we are about to enter a jobless economy. Houses will be cheap but loans will not be abundant.

It is hard to escape the negative thought pattern as well as anger for why my generation got sold out to the highest bidder. I feel so tame like a housecat. Unwilling to raise my voice of concern all the while knowing that the scream, once pronounced, will fall upon deaf ears.

You don't have to be too old to remember how rural areas collapsed in a slow, un-mowed, business failure decline after this last recession. What is my drive? What is my purpose? Where do I belong? Do I need to continue to yearn for this domesticated life that they continue to try to sell us? It is so ingrained into us that school is the solution and jobs are the solution. We have gradually been bought out by foreign interests all across my state. When quarantine is over there will be a shell of the capitalist nation left.

What will be our drive coming out of this? What is your drive to stay sober and continue on?",5,2

NSAIDs, Tylenol Are used in the UK and caribbean for post op patients. If it’s really bad then maybe morphine. And I’m a doctor. This oxycodone shit has fucked everyone. Those forums that promote that shit I feel so sorry for them. It’s fun now, but when real life starts it’s gonna be miserable. I’m so happy big pharma is getting fucked. 

I have been clean only 3 days now which I obviously  is short. so im still in mild withdrawal. i used for a year and a half and took breaks especially when i left the country for like a month.+ and never had cravings for it. Longest I’ve never used when I’m back here is 7 days. So my goal is to make 8 days :) and then I’ll break that record and it will be 9 days and on and on til 100. But I know I have to take it day by day. 

MY QUITTING STORY: so I had run out of H and I was so bored that I called my dealer up. while waiting for him in the car park, my dad from another country randomly calls me to say how he has been sober 40 years now. He stopped drinking alcohol when he had me.   That just changed everything. He doesn’t know I used. I jump in my dealers car and I tell him keep the money, he wanted to give me the baggies and I said no hold it. I told him I want to stop before this gets really bad. I asked him to delete my number and to block it, and to never take calls or texts from me no matter what. This dude, my dealer, an old Rasta looking individual was on the verge of crying. He said he was so proud I’m kicking this shit and he feels so guilty for ever giving us this stuff. It was a life changing moment . Even after I left he texted me that he’s so proud and he’s super  guilty and he knows that I have the will power to kick this shit. (I guess u can text even tho u block the number, he probably didn’t receive my text). This was 3 days ago. I wish the best for my FIRST  and LAST only h dealer. He is an amazing guy. 


Next story:
COVID. is bout to break  me, i am not a lonely person, I love socializing and going outside. I’m located in Florida so it’s normal to go outside all the time. i sm so depressed everyday. i nave the best family nd social supoort and job yet the last couple days I have been severely depressed Mx 

***anyone ever had LUCK quitting and staying clean without an addiction doctor/specialist and or group therapy/NA or using pharmaceuticals like subuxone***


thanks for reading my post and reaching this far. again, i feel depressed, i cried yesterday about 30 times randomly for no reason.  i sleelp like 1-2 nrs. bexahse i stopped benzos as well. i mostly  muse it for sleep. Either it was an ambjen, opiate,, alcohol for about 10 years. I never used it outside of sleep so it is easy for me to kick it.  But my body doesn’t want to sleep. Any ideas what would help? I’m also feeling so fatigued from withdrawals . I’m fighting it and trying to wake up shower , fix my bed. I even exercised for 30 mins yesterday.

***because of my JOB  i cant admit it to.any doctors. anyone on bere bave any stories of quitting cold turkey and being able to sleep wothout pills?***

THE BIG QUESTION: should i leave the country for a couple months to ensure I stay drug free, then try to find a job in a different state than where I live. 

again GOOD JOB on those that are clean. allways remeber everday is a battle even if it is your 100th day and you have to win it! we have such tough lives. but we’re stronger than the average person and we’ve experienced life. Never regret using, Be angry, be sad but don’t regret, that was just part of your life; had a little too much fun ;) and it’s time to grow up right? i am going to kick it. i forgot to mention my roommate uses too, and i left him recently  and moved somewhere else. im really determined to stop. i cant wait for covid to be over. 

sorry for the long post and typos. im using my phone.  last question does your body and mind (depression) get better? and are the cravings just as bad a year from now?


thank you everyone. im not religious at all, but i decided to koin a church to be around positive happy people. so god bless every single one of you girls and gals. ♥️and ✌🏽 and positive vibes.. stay s💪 with me.

I am making this post because I heard the 1st step to getting over a problem is admitting you have one so, this is it. I am a 24F and I have been taking perc30 for a maybe a year, maybe less and it has created HUGE problems in my life. I started off recreationally just because and I really did enjoy getting high. I found some money around the house my mom had stashed and I thought I was just taking a bit here and there but then I ended up spending all of it on pills. About $20,000. I told her I gave the money to a scammer otp. I still didn't think I had a problem. Then one day after I had bought about 6-10 pills I took 3 and almost died. Straight up. I knew they looked funny but I took them anyway. Usually I take 5-6 but I only took 3 at the time to see how they were then I was gonna take the other 3 later if I liked them. However, after those 3 my mom and I were watching TV and I wouldn't wake up. When I finally did wake up there were paramedics pushing me outside on a stretcher, I was shaking, and without my pants on. They had to use 2 doses of narcan to revive me. I refused to stay in the hospital because I didn't want my mom to find out what I had in my system. I still hadn't learned my lesson. I continued to buy. I bought about 4 more times afterwards, today being the latest and hopefully the last. Typically I buy thru a 3rd party, my ""cousin,"" and I never see or talk to the dealer directly- she does. What I think was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" today was that I found out my ""cousin"" has been overcharging me. I thought me and this girl were friends. Because of the time i bought those bad pills I wanted to see what I was buying today. Initially she didn't want me to come in but I did anyways. I bought those bad pills with her. I never told her I almost died from them but I did tell her to throw hers away because they were fake asf and made me sick. Since then we bought 1 more batch of fakes from the same guy from today but they didn't have any noticeable physical affect on me, THANK GOD. This lead me to actually meeting the dealer inside of her apartment and I told him about the fakes he sold us (even then she was trying to talk over me and tell him we were talking about something else, I told him no and showed him a pic of the ones I was talking about). When we both walked outside he told me to take his number and call him, at 1st I wasn't but I'm glad I did. When I called him he told me they were being shady and he wanted me to see the pills too. He was honest, saying that she told him I liked the fake ones before (never said that) that's why he gave them to me again. Eventually I asked what he was charging per pill, because for a while I had a feeling she was using me to get pills for herself too but I couldn't prove it and I had no other way to get them, and  he told me $35. She had been telling me $50(ik ik ik but I really am not street savy and I thought ik what I was doing)!!!! This really pissed me off because I had been using a ton of money, I thought she was my ""friend"", and she was just using me. Clearly, I don't know wtf I'm doing so I need to stop while I still can. So, I told my mom that I was done doing bad stuff and I am (at least I really want to be) however, I last took $1600 off her card that I'm hoping she doesn't notice because I really want to move on. I want to stop, I don't want to fight with her over it anymore, and I want my life to go back to normal. I used to be a good person, I really genuinely do love my mom, and I hate the person and problems I have now. I have been lying to everybody including myself but now I want to go cold turkey and being completely straight edge. I hope that the latest $1600 isn't noticed (I took about $500, $500, $600) because I prayed and promised God that I am ready to change. I'm just tired of everything and that's why I want to change because I don't want to have to lie and scheme and hurt and be high anymore. I don't want to hide anymore I want to be free.",7,0

Just wanted to share my story.  Hopefully it will resonate with someone and make a difference.

I'm 30 years old.  Didn't have much of an addiction background when I was younger.  The normal highschool drinking and smoking was the extent.  Didn't try cocaine until I was 22.

Throughout my years I've sparsely been prescribed vicodin for things like wisdom teeth, broken bones, ect.  I enjoyed the feeling when I had the meds but was able to let it go once they ran out.  I never actively sought opiates.

Fast forward to a few years ago - my mother lost her battle with cancer.  I didn't know, but at the time I had picked cocaine back up and was using it to dull my emotions.  Working, fully functional, just had never dealt with something like this before - so I was using it to detach myself.

Likewise, anxiety and stress isn't something I had experienced.  A good childhood and living environment kept them at bay, coupled with my passion for powerlifting; I always had a physical and mental outlet but was oblivious to it.  With my mothers death and feeling strongly underdeveloped with my education and career, opiates soon came into the picture.

A year later I had surgery on my foot and was prescribed 5mg vicodin.  I wasn't in pain but popped them anyway and liked the feeling.  That quickly became a 50-100mg habit which also became costly, so I switched to 15mg oxy's.  I was taking 200-300mg per day plus a gram or two of coke at my peak.  My savings account drained.  I even tapped into my 401k.

I had gotten sober twice before going to rehab.  The first time I went to work and toughed it out.  It wasn't terrible, but I definitely felt shitty for 3 days.  Second time a week before my international vacation I went cold turkey and that really sucked.  I enjoyed my vacation and said I was never doing it again.  Unfortunately, it only gave me confidence.

I woke up on 06/10/2019 in pain and decided I couldn't do it anymore.  That day is a blur, but I essentially went to a rehab facility sponsored by my job.  Was there for 70 days.  During my time there, I has gotten fired.  Coming out of rehab with my bank accounts drained, destroyed credit, selling my car I had put endless work and money into, I felt completely defeated.

My family supported me for a short while before I moved out.  I've since gotten a new job, am currently renting and working on getting financially stable.  Things are finally looking up and I am so glad I've moved on from that time in my life.

My current battle is getting off buprenorphine.  For whatever reason, my doctor cranked me up to 36mg while in rehab.  As of today, I'm at 2mg and am hoping to be off within a few months.

The past couple years have been a roller coaster of emotion.  I'm glad in some sense I had experienced this.  It's only made me stronger and served as an eye opener for other things.

113,2020-04-18 21:35:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/g3z89b/day_one_again/,Day one. Again.,"Hello all,

I guess I am just coming here for support because I can’t go anywhere else. 

To make a very long and tedious story short, I was a heroin addict from the time I was 19 until I was 23 and then on and off with relapses until I got pregnant with my son 5 years ago. During the time I was an addict I overdosed 5 times, ended up in the hospital, had my rib cage cracked from cpr on the side of a road, all the usual. 

I have been clean completely for 5 years. And. Like a dunce, started doing an oxy here and an oxy there and suddenly, ta da, I’m addicted to pills. Shocking right? Who would have thought it. 

I will never touch heroin again, but here I am, a single mom, in grad school, with a career, and buying pills like an idiot. I keep trying to stop. So far I’ve tried to cold turkey twice and taper three times. It’s not happening. 

I have to stop. For my son. For my career. And for my life. But for some reason I can’t take even the tiniest bit of withdrawal without being thrown back into the PTSD of the years I lived as an addict.

I feel like I should make an excuse and go stay with my parents for a week or two to get past the withdrawal symptoms, but I can’t, because I’m currently quarantined alone in my apartment with my four year old. 

I know that I can kick this. I have a billion times. I guess I just needed to talk to someone, and I have no one. I put my family through hell with addiction. They are JUST starting to truly trust me again. 

So. Here I am. Reaching out to strangers on the internet for support. I don’t know what I want from you all. Just, I guess, someone to tell me that I’m not the biggest piece of shit on the planet and that I’m going to be able to do this, and that I’m not going to spend the rest of my life relapsing every five years and finding myself back in a position I never saw myself ever being in again.

Thanks for this sub, and the support you all offer each other. Stay healthy. Stay safe.

117,2020-04-18 09:06:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/g3n7tc/stop_giving_antipsyhotic_and_antidepressant/,Stop giving antipsyhotic and antidepressant medication against sleep deprivation,"Wrote a long reply to a thread that I think should be written as a thread by itself, so you can understand that much of the medication given against sleep deprivation is directly destructive to the body. It's a slightly long text, but it's worth reading if you think about your health and have trouble sleeping (insomnia).

Truxal (Chlorprothixene) is one of the mild antipsychotic drugs which also has fatigue as a side effect - you should not treat insomnia with the side effects of medicine.

Seroquel (Quetiapine) is a strong antipsychotic drug that gives the patient somnolence (a condition where you cannot stay awake) - one should not give antipsychotic medication to anything but psychotic people. It is directly destructive to the brain and it puts your body on “standby” - it is as if preparations periodically become popular so that all doctors prescribe the same - again disseminating the pharmacy boards instructions.

When using the side effects of medicine as the primary effect, it is called to offlabel - that is basically giving medicine for diagnoses it is not really intended for.

Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that works faster than ""happiness pills"". ""Happiness pills” which are really simply called antidepressants, or quite correctly SSRIs. This means ""selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"".

Mirtazapine is more powerful and faster as it is a SNRI preparation. That means ""Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.""

Sertraline and Citalopram are also SSRIs. Thus, ""selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors"".

All of these preparations are antidepressant and antipsychotic. Hear the titles. And consider getting it for trouble sleeping.

My experience is that SNRIs, SSRIs, SDRIs etc. are preparations that do more harm than they benefit, and in fact many other diagnoses. It is completely insane that people are treated with these preparations for trouble sleeping. If your serotonin levels are normal and you are given a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, then you may have serotonin syndrome caused by excessive levels of serotonin in your prefrontal cortex of the brain.

I've even tried to have serotonin syndrome which can lead to:

\- Worry

\- Shake

\- Fever

\- Tendency to sweat

\- Cramps

Severe cases require you to be hospitalized and receive intensive treatment, as you may have a fever.

You should not take anti-depressant medication as needed (as you do with difficulty sleeping), and the drug has a lot of nasty side effects that you can read. And taking it off label against insomnia creates far more side effects than if you take it as a solid medication ..

If you use your logic, then you may think that you should not medicate people with side effects on medication.

There are medicines for sleep problems.

Nitrazepam is a benzodiazepine which is of the hypnotic class. It's sleep-wrenching.

Otherwise, there is Zopiclone or Zolpidem. These are actually called sleep pills.

It is important that after eating the medicine, you lie in bed, because if you are awake and active when the effect occurs, you become hyperactive.

This medicine is made for insomnia. Then I do not understand why they have to drug people with side effects from antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs when we have drugs that work quite well against insomnia.

When you talk medicine online there is something called HR. Harm reduction. It is a golden rule to advise people so that they do the least harm to themselves.

Therefore, I would advise everyone not to take antipsychotic drugs or SSRI, SNRI, SDRI, etc.

It does more harm than good.

It makes you a wandering zombie. You look completely dead in the eyes and you end up more and more in a state of anhedonia.

Please stop recommending the medicine when you really do not know what it is you are doing.

If you have experience with psychiatry, you know that you have to study yourself (preferably things from the US).

The medicine board destroy people with medicine.

Use http://scholar.google.com - it's Google's research search engine with reliable sources on everything.

If you want to know, I got Seroquel for insomnia before I started studying medicine, and I turn 30 in 14 days, and I'm partially impotent - chronic. Due to Seroquel I got against sleep problems for two years.

It's something I've experienced on my own body. And while on antipsychotic medication, you lose the desire for everything from sex to social events.

&#x200B;

I know very well what the problem is. The problem is sloppiness. They do not examine people thoroughly enough. Children are diagnosed with ADHD based on a 100-question question paper.

If they have ADHD, the first choice is Ritalin (Methylphenidate). What is it really? It is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. What else do we have that same resume inhibitor?

I mean it kind of is, but I wasn't sure. 

Hey, so I'm quite nervous about this. I'm pretty sensitive to withdrawal.

Currently I'm on ~200mg O-DSMT, and I don't want to go cold turkey.
I still have roughly 8mg of buprenorphine left. It's an 8mg pill that has been nibbled at at some point and a half a 2mg pill.

I'm planning to use the bup as of tomorrow for a quick taper (5 or 6 days).

Does anyone know if this could work. And has anyone got any idea of what dose of bup I should start with? Would 2mg be enough on the first day to cover most if not all of the O-DSMT withdrawal?
I'm aware it won't be painless and the withdrawal is inevitable, I am just hoping that switching to a long acting opioid for a short time period will make it easier.

TL;DR: What's the (roughly) equivalent dose of 200mg O-DSMT to buprenorphine, and can I use 8mg of subutex for a quick 5-6 day taper to get off of 200mg O-DSMT/day?

Any input or advice would greatly be appreciated.",0,0

I just found this site today and man, am I glad I did.

Ive been doin heroin for a year now, I just snort the stuff, ion shoot and donthink I could even tho I got some pipes on me. My daddy was a heroin addict too, n he used to shoot it, and man just some of the heartbreakin shit I seen him do for the stuff would make you sick. I was talkin to one of my peers the other day who mentioned his mama smoke crack, and that hed never be a crackhead, all while hes tootin a line of boy lol. It made me wonder, howinthe fuck did I get into this shit.

I got in this stuff cos in part to feelin my daddy and his neglect i think. Its come a long way for me to realize this shit, but I still hold onto the past in that regard, even tho ion even know where tf his ass is, or if hes even still breathing (last I heard was he was in federal prison), and I hate the mf as much as I miss him. And it was realizin this shit that made me realize to that Im doing the EXACT SAME SHIT to my son. and so yeah, I got a week clean this time and I wanna watch it grow like residuals.

any advice for someone whose just getting clean? ive been to a couple na and aa meetings and shit, but that aint really my typea deal... They talk about god too damn much, and being raised in a home with christianity and growing to resent that god for not doing shit to save me or my mama from all the bs we went thru, then just not believin period like wit santa claus cos you saw santa claus shootin dope on the toilet and passed out when he had the whole world fulla kids to take carea lol oml- but like thats been my experience wit it ands what moulded me to not believe in shit.

I've clucked in the past from Oxycodone, oral morphine, tramadol, a *heavy* kratom habit and too many times from high dose codeine because it's so available where I am.

I can cope with the shits, the nausea, the anxiety, the low mood, the chills, the runny nose, pretty much all of it.

But if there's one thing for me that will push me into the direction of aborting the withdrawal, it's the fucking restless legs syndrome.  It's insane,  I can't sit, stand, or lie still for a second, and it's starting to kick in about now.

I expect having been through so many withdrawals over the years there's a kindling effect which makes even a piss ant codeine habit a ballache to get off but am trying.

If I get enough participants, and you guys request it, I could maybe ,at the end of the research, interpret the results of the tests,and maybe send them to you individually or something.

I had to check my emails today as if I don't they build up to unmanageable levels, only to find emails pointing out a bunch of errors and things that need fixing etc etc.  I'm not a web developer so I've done wonders even getting a site up but every task is like a 10 hour stress and google fest and I can't find help out there, I've asked to hire experts and been told it's 2 hours, 22 hours, or 6 hours for exactly the same job!!! With anything from $90 to $500 to $2500 to fix it! So who in hell do I trust to a) know what they're talking about and b) not try to rip money off me.

I read the emails today and thought about putting a gun to my head (I don't have a gun so that's fine!), seems to be just people on my back demanding things, demanding I act or do x, y or z and not even acknowledging that I might be struggling too.

I'm financially ruined, pretty much, I've lost all my usual face to face contact and live alone, and I'm going through opiate withdrawal, I know I'm going to feel less able to handle stress because of that but FFS will some people just give me a break for a little while. I'm just trying to get through one hour at a time while my neurotransmitter system is imploding from within.

I feel like lying and telling people I have Covid (I don't, I think I've had it already) just to get them to leave me alone for a while and stop hassling me with things that don't really matter. Part of me just wants to take the Covid bullet for someone else and exit stage left out of this misery.

I'll survive but I hate how every time, EVERY time I've ever been trying to get off opiates life has decided at that moment to create a shitstorm of epic proportions!

I grew up in Puerto Rico then moved to the mainland US where I lived when I was 8. Had my first opiate experience at 16 for dental surgery and I was immediately in love. I’m not street smart though so my experimentation was limited to whenever someone lent me a pill or when I had dental issues (of which I had a lot).

Fast forward to 2013, I’m a freelance reporter working in war zones, mostly in LatAm because of my fluency in Spanish (obviously this isn’t my real name), and I get sent to Colombia. One day I’ve got an abscess tooth and I figure I’ll go to the pharmacy and get some Advil. The pharmacist says, man that looks bad, how about buying this - it’s called Dovir, it’s 200mg ibuprofen and 5mg hydrocodone. 

Say what? You don’t need a script? Nope. All downhill from there.

I started by occasionally popping them, then it became one to wind down at the end of the day, then two, then four, then I realized I was taking 1600mg of ibuprofen per day at that might not be good. I went to get a kidney check because I was feeling sluggish and yep, I had stage 1 kidney disease.

Did that stop me? Nope, I’m an addict. I switched to acetaminophen 325mg and 5mg of hydro, brand name Sinalgen. No script for that either. Then I learned about CWE and my habit really took off. By January of 2019 I was doing a box a day (30 pills so 150mg of hydro). 

I considered myself a CWE master. Once a week I’d buy 7 boxes of 30 pills (pharmacists knew I was an addict; didn’t care. Mr Ryan, are you sure you don’t want an extra box?) and I would filter those bad boys and put them into 5 hour energy bottles so I could take them throughout the day. Life was good. Colombia is cheap, a box of 30 5mg hydros cost about $35 at today’s exchange rate.

Later in 2019 they released “Sinalgen Max”, 325mg/10mg! A little more expensive but double the hydro! My habit went even more crazy.

I’ve tried to quit 9 other times. Never made it more than 3 months, and even then only on trips  back to the US. Know why? I don’t need a connect. They sell this poison in every pharmacy, and there are pharmacies everywhere (note: only where I live in Colombia, not throughout- so not Bogotá, for example)

So now I’m on my 10th and last recovery and two weeks clean. How? 

Well last month I saw this shelter-in-place coming so I went into the pharmacy to ask if they could sell me 60 boxes. Absolutely Mr Ryan, want some toothpaste to go with that? We don’t have that many but we’ll get them. However there’s a problem.

Uh what kind of problem?

Colombia just passed a new law. Hydrocodone is a controlled substance now, you need a script. We can sell you these 60 boxes but as of April 1, you need to produce a script. Sorry.

Oh shit.

So that was it. I’ve never been the type to go looking on the street. My 10th try will be my last try. So I bought those 60 boxes and I rationed them, tapering down every day, two weeks ago I made my last clear-as-water CWE. 

It’s been tough. I know if I could still walk into those pharmacies and get the product, I’d have it. But I can’t. So that’s that. I’m still craving heavily and I’m exhausted all the time, but I’m drug free. Hopefully life gets better. 

Sorry for the long message. Please wish me luck in this being a permanent thing.",4,0

I have been an opiate addict for about 20 years with everything under the sun abused before that. I have been taking kratom successfully (I know that is not, strictly speaking, even a possible thing to some) for about 3 years. I say 'successfully' and what I mean is this: I was healthier, happier and able to better maintain relationships than I had been all of my adult life. I was cruising and while things were not ideal, they were MUCH MUCH better then they had been while actively using prescription medications (benzos and opiates and SSRIs) or heroin  or alcohol and coke or any combination used before. I took on a new type of work which was more physical than I was used to and had more aches and pains. I am a 45 yo male and while I do physical work by trade, this was a much more rigorous type. I had heard from a family member who is a doctor about how the laws on bupenorphine have changed a lot and that they dispense it out of emergency rooms now to people who are actively seeking to abstain from heroin and pain meds etc. I knew all about suboxone from my past dealings with it, and knew it was great for aches and pains and thought I could 'handle' it. The conversation was not intended to steer me from kratom TO suboxone but that's exactly what it did.

&#x200B;

What a fucking mistake.

&#x200B;

I almost instantly turned into that same raging beast. I was OCD about obtaining and consuming more and more, more often. For about two weeks I was able to blissfully take a relatively small amount (4mgs) once a day when I got home from work and I told myself things were fine. In all honesty I was getting high as fuck from them and enjoying every second of it BECAUSE I wasn't being honest with myself at the time. I allowed myself to backslide YEARS of work in a matter of days to allow for these very brief moments of bliss. With all the virus craziness, things eventually broke down..work dried up and drugs became harder to get and afford.

&#x200B;

Let the nightmare begin:

&#x200B;

I am about three weeks in to abstinence from about fourmonths of using the suboxone and I am still a mess. I had actually forgotten how bad this is. The kratom is helping greatly as far as diarrhea, restless legs and sleep but...I was in a waking nightmare for every bit of ten days or so. Now I am just in this 'in between' stage where everything smells weird and I feel like I am tripping half the time, the other half I am just shaky and irritable. that is WITH kratom on board.

&#x200B;

This is not meant to be a pro kratom rant. This is meant to be an anti suboxone one. I think if you are a heavy streeet drug, heroin and fentanyl user, then suboxone has a time and place. That window for using it though...keep it as short as possible. This drug I have just BARELY managed to untangle myself from is not a fucking joke. I haad only used subs after I was using HUGE amounts of opiates before and always thought it didn't get you high. I call bullshit on that now. It gets you high as shit when your tolerance is low. It is very very difficult to stop using. I cannot believe they are allowing for easier access and basically life long use of this shit.

&#x200B;

It seems to me that abstinence and active recovery from ALL things (kratom included) is the best bet. After that it is really just degrees of harm reduction, and for some of us that may be as good as it gets for now. I just cannot believe I am back in this head space after all this time.

I was taking 0.5mgs before that. I initially had lots of motivation, and got rid of all the remaining suboxone I had. The first week was pretty shitty but I figured it would be. At the week 2 mark I went and bought Kratom, just enough for the day. A week later I found some almost empty bags of Kratom and drank what I could scrape out of them. All told today I was feeling pretty good. Sweats and chills were almost non existent. Still a lil depressed, and much less energy than I am accustomed to. Today I found about 2mgs of suboxone lying around. Against my better judgement I took about 0.5mgs of what I had found. I really regret it, and feel stupid for having done this after I was already starting to approach a reasonable state of being. Both times I took the Kratom it made me feel super speedy, and the following day I felt pretty lousy, but after that It felt like I was back on course. I have 0 intention of taking Kratom again, it was less enjoyable than I thought it would be and I knew it was detrimental to my long term goals. I really wanted to get off suboxone, and it was something I had been striving towards for quite some time. I was hoping for any words of encouragement, and wondering what I should expect following this relapse. Will this restart any of the withdrawal symptoms I had been previously experiencing? Or just make it take longer to get back to normal? I know there might not be a clear answer to this question, but any words of encouragement or insight is much appreciated. Its funny how just as things start to get easier the cravings sneak up on you. Thanks!",2,0

I had a God awful day yesterday. Missed 2 assignments because of how confusing the online interface is and had an (irrational) panic attack over that because I cannot stand the thought of my gpa going below an A grade... fucking really OD of me I know but what makes it so much worse is that I know I would have no trouble getting anything done and handing in everything on time if things were normal.  

 R heard me crying which I normally try very hard not to do around him, he has this visceral reaction to anyone crying like that prob Cuz his alcoholic mom used to cry to him like that when he was a little kid, so I cut him some slack like he's not just being a total asshole. But I told him what I was upset over and how I knew it was irrational but I needed someone to like comfort me and tell me in a calm way HOW I was being irrational so that I could snap out of it a little. Even while I was telling him this I knew he was the wrong person to ask. He did do what I asked but in a pretty harsh way, which I mean what was I expecting lol, and of course when i shot his comments down (cuz that's what people do when they're in the middle of an irrational freak out) ofc he got really mad and we ended up in a big fight.  

So the rest of the day was absolutely horrible, i was already in a shit mood but that shit backfiring was the icing on the cake. I wanted to kill myself and my mental health was worse than it's been in fucking ages. I did get some school work done thank fuck but I like couldn't even eat for the first 8 hours I was awake. Cried more yesterday than prob any time since I've gotten clean, fucking sucked. The closest thing I can compare that feeling to is that dark hopeless despair of being dopesick.  

I am just so down on myself for not being productive at all waking hours and perfect and normal. It makes me feel like a weak amd useless person. I miss the way things were so much. When things were normal, literally my idea of the worst day ever was spending all day in the house. Idk I've been making slow progress on having a better and more productive routine but yesterday I really felt like I was going insane trapped in this house. I 100% would've done drugs in that moment if they were like already in my house easily available to me. Honestly it helps having R around Cuz I know how angry he would be at me if I used (and vice versa when I'm in a normal mental state) so it helps both of us keep each other accountable.  

Idk. I don't feel as bad today and I need to try my absolute hardest to stay feeling normal. Having good mental health was coming so easily to me in the last 6 months or so. Guess I was spoiled. I mean even in the worst of times I'm much better at handling and rationalizing my emotions than i used to- a year and a half ago it would be unimaginable that I could feel like that and not get fucked up at all. But it's just... a battle I don't want to have to fight. I'm just fucking tired, I just want things to be nice and normal and boring. Like I said when this all started, I've ""flipped the table of my life"" sooo many times voluntarily, like self sabotaging everything and starting over somewhere new, and I was finally done with all that, had the legs of my table bolted the fuck down, and what happens but the world flips the table for me.  

Oh well. As cliche as it is, hard times is what made me who I am today and for the most part I like who I am. On the bright side, all this bullshit and darkness will only make me appreciate everything in life even more when things do return to (the new) normal. This ain't the first time I've had a mental breakdown and I'm sure as shit it won't be the last lol. But I always pick myself up and keep going and maybe doing it without drugs is a little harder but it's a lot more impressive and way better in every aspect in the long run.  

Sorry this was long 😣 if anyone has any little ~quarantine mental health tips~ (ugh kill me lol) let a girl know! Sometimes a little thing that feels obvious to you can be totally surprising to someone else and end up really helping them. I hope all of y'all are having a better day!! How is everyone doing now that we are coming up on a month of quarantine in some places? And of course thank u guys for putting up with my dumb bullshit and my venting.

I’m currently weening off real oxycodone 30mg. I have a basically unlimited, free supply. Never hurt the bank, and I use the money I make selling these to support my weed habit. Luckily I get enough for free on a weekly basis to sell and use. However, I don’t like basically not making money because all of it goes to my weed. But if I sold ALL of them I could be smoking weed, free of my habit, and saving money all at the same time PRETTY SWEET. Lol. 

I’ve been weening for almost two weeks. Got it down to about 35 to 38mg a day from around 80mg a day. What are some tips on fully kicking the habit? I also have unlimited supply of benzos (lorazepam to be exact) so I could use those to quit too if it would help? I love weed so much. It brings out my soul, what I truly want to be like on a day to day basis — not necessarily a pothead, cause I really only take a few dabs a day, but it just makes me truly happy. I feel like oxy takes that all away, makes me forget how happy I can be when I’m just stoned. And I hate that. Oxy makes me feel like I’m taking huge steps in the wrong direction every time I do a line. I wanna just smoke weed and make money and be happy! 

I also am going through a weird breakup right now with my girl of 2 years. She’s been cheating and lying basically the whole relationship, and my use sort of started from her abusing me in these ways. I would jus use to cope. And with me finally trying to really break it off with her, it’s caused more stress but she’s so toxic and I know I need to get rid of her to really help myself. And I would always just say fuck it and use instead of dealing w the fact that she would tell me shes in love with me, then instead of going to work go get drunk with her friends? Shit was fucked up. It’s just been a wild time. 

I know this post is all over the place, and for that I apologize. I’m stoned. Hungry. Feeling weird and desperate for answers and freedom.

Hi this is my 1st post, i hope i’m in the right place-if not i would really be grateful if someone could direct me to where i should post

I’ve been using codeine/dihydrocodeine for about 3 years, mostly just weekends but daily for the last 2 months or so, around 300-400mg a day, a larger dose (200-250) in the morning and then another (100-150) in the evening usually just to stave off early withdrawals

I really want to quit now and have tried CT many times, i just end up relapsing due to withdrawals and boredom, normally on day 4 or 5

I  want to try a taper plan and i think if i can plan this properly with a strict schedule i will stick to it

I realise i will still experience some withdrawals, especially at the start and when i jump off, i accept this, i just want to lessen these enough so i don’t get them so bad that i relapse completely

Also i want to do this in a matter of weeks not months and months (which i’ve seen advised on other threads) ... i tried it once over 7 days and it was way too fast (i.e i felt awful during and awful when i jumped off!) so i get it that it takes a bit of time... i have 3-4 weeks to play with

Any advice would be massively appreciated, i don’t know a soul who uses like me so have nowhere to turn really...

This batch was something I bought from a Dealer on an unnamed market, but if you are familiar you can figure it out. The same batch of his stuff that I was snorting (I've never IV'd anything) killed a man on the east coast. The day after Christmas.

I was 6 months clean of H until I took fentanyl presses starting about 3 weeks ago, and had 3 separate 2 and 3 day binges. I am waiting on a bag of BTH right now and I am going to flush it the instant I get it. I have been in an outpatient rehab for just over a year now-this is my second relapse since starting treatment and meetings. God do I have naltraxone, it makes me violently ill.  I copped to using the fent presses today-spoke with my counselor who wisely said I need to decide if I actually want to be clean. I am not working due to covid and all I do is sit all day every day. Teaching myself IT for Net+ certification but overall feel worthless. I believe somehow doomed to relapse every 6 to 8 months. I am really fuckin scared at this point-I'm almost 40 and I haven't gotten over myself. I only care about getting what I want, when I want it. I DIDN'T take H!

This is such a difficult time for everyone, all we can hope for is that by laying bare all of the severe issues we face not just as a country here in the US but all over the world, our governments can finally quit sweeping everything under the rug-- there is no rug now; that rug is gone-- and finally start to put systems and policies in place that are in the best interest of us people and the issues we're facing.

I am mohammad...22 yrs old from Iran
I wanted to write this post to help you dear friends stop taking opiates and prevent relapse...please do not use it as a tool that you think quitting is easy and you can quit anytime and so continue abusing drugs
I hope it would help you:)
The medications that work best for withdrawal:
L-tyrosine:take it on empty stomach only before every meal...it gives you energy and helps dopamine depletion and helps manage stress
Acetaminophen codeine:may linger withdrawal a little but helps a lot
Ginseng or ashwagandha:for physical and mental strength...ginseng is more stimulating and ash is more sedating
Multivitamines:addiction depletes vitamins and minerals
Calcium and magnesium(citrate form only):helps hugely for relaxation...even normal ppl have depletion in magnesium so you must take it
Gingko biloba:increases dopamine and helps blood circulation
Avoid caffeine,sugar,fapping,smoking,alcohol
Eat healthy and blood forming diet such as:meat(not pork of course!),eggs,shrimp,milk and dates shake,raising,almond or almond milk(highly recommanded!),dried fruits,etc
They are best foods for testosterone in iranian traditional medication and help you become stronger physically and mentally
Keep yourself occupied
Take shower
Take valerian or chamomile or passion flower or lemon balm for sleep
Gaba+melatonin supplements are effective!
Remember each individual reacts differently to these supplements...you should see what suits you best
Hope i could help you recover from these evil drugs:)",10,0

Not covid related but his arm wound has gotten so bad since the surgery he couldn't keep just like hoping it would go away, I mean he's had the wound for over a year now not good. Luckily he went to one of the better hospitals ER dept- he called before going to ask if they were like overwhelmed and apparently they were pretty chill so at like 10pm last night he walked over there. They ran a bunch of tests which is really really good but he got back here at 3am and just got into bed wearing the same fucking clothes he was sitting in the hospital like what the fuck is wrong with him how hard is it to just like take off your virus clothes before you get into bed?!  

Got a lot of homework done yesterday which is good. Also finished Tiger King;  what a trip. I definitely don't miss parts of my life where I was just surrounded by bad people... everyone sucks in that documentary (except maybe reinke and cowie and safferty) which is what makes it so fun to watch but man I do not miss having people like that in my life. (SPOILERS AHEAD)  

Edit: oh yeah, also I can't believe they glossed over the fact that Joe basically coerced two men who had never had any gay relationships into the past to staying with him because he provided them with drugs... my heart really hurt for John and especially Travis, the way they described what happened to him to me at least really painted a picture of a man completely trapped by both his addiction and an emotionally abusive relationship. I know that feeling of staying with someone for the drugs and that breeds waaay deeper self hatred than just addiction alone. I dunno that whole part about the meth n shit was so short but I feel like they should've gone a little more in depth with it because even from the first few episodes I could tell by the casts behavior that addiction was rampant at that zoo.  

How is everyone doing today? It really sucks that lockdown coincides with the weather getting nicer. I'm so jealous of anyone with a private outdoor space 😭 hope everyone is hanging in there, if you're in the first week or two and still feeling like shit you're amazing, you got this, you're making the best decision of your life and I promise you you'll get through this!

But I wont entertain the notion of giving up drink and weed again even though I ""know"" I should. I was so ashamed to be an addict I gave up being clean almost to put it behind me..what a joke.

Hi everyone, I am scared. Had and still do have legit script for Oxy 30s  (severe neck issues from accident many yrs ago).

But since Dec, I have been using caps, scramble, or whatever the fuck fent mixture. I don't know wtf or how I got here, well, bc yes I do--I was running out of my reg script each month and couldn't afford 1.00 per mg for my oxy. So a girl I know introduced me to these caps and been on them about 5 mo.

I REALLY WANT OFF. I have been doing about 8-10 caps a day (was doing 15+day about month ago). I don't know how many grams that is, don't have scale. 😑

Here is my question: IF I HAVE THE WILLPOWER, can I taper down and get off this shit and if I go slow enough will it be ""relatively""painless? I have had WDs many times, and it is bad, just not off THIS shit for that long. 

If I COULD taper, would it be like 10/day and then 9/day for a few days and then 8/day for a few days etc... 

I am desperate and sort of suicidal bc I have let this happen. I did not realize this was worse or harder than H. I have never injected or anything-just snorting. Any advice I would appreciate-like a taper schedule. I am afraid. I have about 50 xan bars-with one refill-I tapered off xanax about 3 yrs ago and that was awful- so don't want that again. 

Also--what if I just knocked myself out for 5 days on bars and ambien. Can I get thru that way? Say if I am down to 4-5 caps a day?

Will I be vomiting? Kicking? Don't have health insurance, so ER out of question. 

Thank you so much. Your advice may save my life. And when I feel well enough, and it is safe to go out, I will go to NA. Very familiar w/the program since family is full of addicts. Please help.

As the title suggests I am day 23 since taking opiates. (Was on codeine last, around 300mg per day) and this was for around 4/5 weeks.. prior to that I have been on almost everything at different stages.

So I will start at the beginning.. I have dabbled on and off with opiates for years, but never experienced opiate withdrawal. I have had other addictions and dependency’s so I was extra careful with opiates. I had always just dosed once or twice and stopped, given a break for 2 months then had another go for 1/2 days. Reading of the withdrawal I always consciously respected opiates and never allowed dependency. I have used black tar, raw opium and every type of pills you can get hold of in the Uk. 

At the start of this year a friend of mine gave me some Kratom and upon researching many people say you cannot get withdrawal so I took it daily for nearly 3 weeks in very high doses. After taking a smaller dose one day I had the most severe reaction, started shaking uncontrollably and had an overwhelming feeling I was about to have a seizure. I did not attribute it to withdrawal at the time. I decided to not take it again and experienced extreme withdrawals for a month, to start with I had no idea what was going on, after a week I realised it was withdrawal, I started to feel better after 2 weeks then got really bad once again (p.a.w.s for sure) then after a month had passed I still felt awful (even felt like I was getting worse) so I went to see a gp and they told me it’s not withdrawal and sent me in to hospital. I trusted the gp and after ct scans and being kept in hospital they couldn’t find anything wrong... gave me a codeine 240mg/day prescription for my pain and sent me on my way....

I started taking the codeine and BAM started feeling somewhat normal! Realising this and doing more research I knew I was having withdrawal the whole month and shouldn’t be taking codeine! 
I then tried multiple times to stop codeine but the withdrawal was so unbearable along with the anxiety that I could have another reaction like the Kratom... I was so scared! The doctor and I then agreed on a taper plan for the next few months, but I started getting really bad stomach problems from the codeine... constant pain and couldn’t keep food down, heartburn and reflux. 
So I decided to quit cold turkey. I had tapered to 120mg before quitting.

The initial 10 day acute phase was bad (but not bad like the kratom at the start of the year) I had high fever, extreme muscle spasms, deep joint aches and pain, shaking, chills you name it. 
Then after day 10 started to feel better, even though some symptoms remained I have greatly improved.

Fast forward the to day 20, I started getting similar feelings to the Kratom withdrawal... dizzy when standing and itchy skin, disassociated and a weird tingle feeling at the back of my head. Little bits of paranoia and anxiety for no reason. 
Then last night night (day 22) I had severe heart palpitations, feeling very uncomfortable and hot, then started shaking and having bad muscle spasms.. I felt like I was right back in the first couple days of withdrawal :(
Today (day 23) I feel better, albeit I still have this weird feeling at the back of my head and really itchy/uncomfortable skin and some dizzy/disassociated feeling. 

My questions are to those with more experience: 
1) Is this normal for me to feel such extreme physical symptoms like shaking and muscle spasms happening at this date? 
2) I still sneeze here and there and have swollen lymph nodes in my neck, is this normal?
3) I assume this is paws (again), and I need to power through.. do you get physical symptoms that come and go in paws ? There isn’t much info on paws online about the physical. 

I would be more than happy to answer any questions about myself and past substances used and addictions.

Side note: my doctor also has booked me an MRI brain scan to have a more detailed look and rule out other issues but with the covid 19 disease it has to be put on hold. I hope/assume I will be healed before the time covid has passed, if this is all just down to opiate withdrawal.

Thank you for your interest in sharing your perspective. Our hope is we can shed light on ways recovery outcomes can improve despite or even because of isolation.*  


Hello, r/OpiatesRecovery,

I’m Paul, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University on a team working with a Pittsburgh-based non-profit to research and improve the domain of addiction, substance use disorder, recovery, and sobriety.

We are conducting a **diary study**, or a study in which we provide you a couple of questions to think about, and twice a day, you report on your answers to those questions. **We’re interested in learning if social distancing and responsible isolation in light of COVID-19 impacts your relationship with recovery.**

A couple quick points about the study:

* This is a **two-week long study**
* It is a research exercise that should **only take 10 minutes per day**: 5 minutes in the morning, and 5 minutes in the evening
* The study requires a smart phone or laptop that can receive SMS messages
* A student researcher will also want to talk to you over the phone or via Zoom two or three times a week for an additional 10-15 minutes to ask questions about the study.
* We are able to compensate you a total of $45 for your participation in three increments.

If you are interested in learning more or in signing up, we would be grateful! Your participation could shed insight on ways to improve the process of recovery and treatment from substance use disorder, even in a crisis. Please send a chat or direct message with your email so we can send you information to determine your eligibility. **I may not be able to get back to you until tomorrow morning (Sunday April 5th, Eastern Daylight Time), but if you reply to this post, I will be sure reach out to you.**

Thank you,

Paul",1,2

Honestly, i never thought i would make it this far. I didnt want to get sober when i was using, the thought never crossed my mind. I got sober because i got really sick with MRSA, had abscesses in both lungs and my knee. I called my father for help and when he broke down crying, so did i. I got clean that day and went to the hospital, where i spent 3 months fighting death. I won. I had to use a walker for 6 months, couldnt breathe on my own, and still struggle but hey, im alive. 

My addiction really took off when i was a victim of  human traffiking in 2018. I was held against my will until april 2019. I was let go because we had gotten evicted from where we were staying, i was dying and they didnt want a dead body on their hands. At first i stayed their a friend of theirs, who forced me to clean his entire house and screamed at me when i couldnt because i literally couldnt walk. I was called lazy, a liar, threatened to get beat up. This situation was actually better for me because at least i wasnt actually getting beat. I told my abuser that my dad was getting me a room, which he was, but instead of having men over, i cried the entire 2 nights i had it and when i wasnt picked up in the morning, i called my dad and went to the ER. 

I always look back and hate myself for not running. But i was terrified. I had stockholm syndrome and thought this person cared about me too. They were very manipulative and i had told them my past, which is how they were able to gain my trust thru a soft spot. I didnt get snatched out of a parking lot or anything dramatic. This person posed as a caring friend, a best friend, and that was something i was lacking after my divorce. They went from the friendly person, feeding me drugs, to extremely abusive, beating on me, and eventually tricking me out against my will. 

Ive been in therapy for a few months now. I fought it for so long because honestly it tears me up to think about it. It took a lot to just type what i did here out, but for me, its easier to type it than say it out loud. I havent actually talked about what happened in therapy yet, i cant get past just sitting there and sobbing. Im terrified of the world, of friendships, even tho i want one so badly. Im so alone. I never leave my room. But at the same time, im also the happiest ive ever been. I get weird looks when i say that, esp from my therapist, but i hope one you know what i mean?

Anyway, after a long battle with addiction, im happy that im kicking its ass. I went through almost anything you can imagine while i was using and it didnt phase me at the time because i was so numb. All the trauma and feelings are hitting me now, and im learning to cope and heal in a healthy way. Ive spent this past year apologizing to other people, but ive realized i need to start apologizing to myself. Instead of ignoring my mental illness and hating myself, i need to love and nuture myself. I was so, so broken and everyone took a piece. Im taking them back now. 

 I used to pray to god that hed just take me and end this, i hoped every bag was my last, constantly tried to OD. And i did die, the person i was died. It sounds dramatic but it truly feels that way, like ive been reborn. Im learning and growing everyday. I hope one day i can help others in my situation. Even if its just one person, itll all be worth it.",110,0

When I was 16 years old I got heavily addicted to heroin, but I am a poly-substance abuser which means I would do just about anything that was put in front of me. I came from a very caring family, maybe a bit strict but after being bullied much throughout middleschool, by the time I got to highschool I was fighting, hanging out with the wrong crowd, and getting myself into legal trouble all the time. 

I knew right away when I tried oxycodone that opiates were my DOC. I skipped almost 3/4 of my senior year in highschool to smoke weed or do drugs. This is just a little background that maybe some people can relate to. The start of my downfall was when I was expelled from school for selling drugs. They found a an ounce of weed in my locker and that was the last straw for them. I lost my amazing scholarship, and had to get my GED. 

Fast forward three years, I'm 19 and completely addicted to heroin IV. I built such a high tolerance that I obviously needed more and more. Not too much longer after, I lost my best friend I knew for 11 years.... OD. I got out of control at that point, kicked out from my parents, disowned by my family that I stole from and lied to.. you guys know the deal. A year later 3 more friends died too. OD, Fentanyl/Heroin combo. 

As if it was a sign of my own future, I OD'd myself February 12th 2013. 

I woke up in the hospital with my mom there looking at me in horror. Apparently I told the cops I wanted to kill myself so they put me in a 72 hour hold next to a rehab. My sobriety date was that day. I never looked back, a big part being the image of my mom's face when I woke up. The people I was with threw me out their car and left me to die on a side road downtown. A cop found me and took me in. 

The point of this story is to remind you that even if it's bad right now, it can, and it will ALWAYS get worse when you're using. Please, take this time of the lockdown to get yourself some help. You deserve so much better in life. If you are curious how I've maintained being sober, feel free to message me and I can run some ideas by you to help. I'm always here.

Governor signed the order yesterday and was closed today, to send the health care workers to ""other departments"". I know there is a serious shortage, but they couldn't let those few patients finish their stay ? At most it would have been 6 days. They said 8 patients were in there at the time. Just really making me think of those souls out there still struggling. I can only imagine what they are going thru. My two month clean anniversary is coming up, and let me tell you. I am so so so happy, I made the decision when I did. But I wouldn't have been able to do it without the help of the detox center. Just wanna say to those still lost out there, I really am thinking and praying for you all. 

In the midst of all that is happening, I still am the happiest I have ever been. My income came to a screeching halt. I am in quarantine, obviously like most of Americans right now. I literally put 3$ in my gas tank lmao. But still, I am genuinely happy. I am healthy, with a healthy pregnancy, and my daughter is happy and healthy, and fed. There are people out there dying alone so who am I to complain? I laugh again. It's really true what they say. That your worse day in recovery is still better than your best day using.

Opiates have fucked my life up BAD.

I don't feel like a part of this society anymore. I'm totally ashamed of myself, my actions, my wasted potential and everything about me.
I often feel like a smelly parasite turd, wasting other people's precious air. 

I meet old friends in the street and see what they've accomplished.
Everyone around here talks, and most know about my addiction. I get along well with most people, but  can always tell by their looks that they all just see another junkie. 

These are all thoughts that kick in instantly when my stash is empty... Is this normal man? I know heroin has a strong effect on me and I always feel depressed when withdrawal sets in, but man, I can't even tell if this is withdrawal or my actual normal condition when sober. 
How the fuck do you guys deal with the mental aspect of withdrawal, and is there any end to it?? 

Looking back I feel like I was a completely naive moron going into this shit man... I'm a strong person, and not actually a sad guy, even though I have struggled with extremely traumatic experiences, I always loved my life.
But man this shit is killing me...",6,0

So where to start I'm 26 a year ago I was in a 5 gear relationship ship had maybe 3 years clean. Long story short relapsed on heroin and held a full time job gf found out then saw o was on needle again tried to quit meny times wds etc eventually she left I quit my job went homeless lived in truck, crashed truck went to jail for a month. Family let me move back. Got on methadone but   am not high enough dose to fully help. Have been also using h 85% time with it.


Taking along time to get to where I need to be one methadone 100mg plus. I don't get sick 8f I don't use dope for a couple days but have insancr cravings for dope even tho I feel like 50 percent of it. Im back living with family who want me to get out of this funk of ex gf etc so I got on methadone. Hard time finding job rn and then this coronaviris has just made me more depressed. I do about 20 a day h with my methadone and I don't have much money so a family member has been helping me buy dope. I'm at 72 mg methadone just up 5mg a week

 so I calling inpatient even tho I'm in outpatient to try and clean up. But Corona is slowing that way down I just feel so bad and am so down I hate narrowing money like this but these cravings are fr. I just feel I'm pushing everything to the limit I'm just like existing.. idk what to do. I'm really trying so hard but am procrastinating.

 I sometime get Ballsey and get some meth and then m up for 2 days and regret it and need black to comedown so have to ask for more money or I sit here heart racing til I can find a way to come down. I had it all,lost it and am now stuck in this funk.

To the point where nothing else gets me off sick. Curious to know if anyone has had the issue of getting new shit. Having it be pretty decent. (Not getting me high but at least allowing me to get through the day. Sleep 5-6 hours at night).  Well usually if the shit stays the same unless it’s really fuckin good it will be coo for a week. Maybe 2 and then it will start to drastically decline. What used to keep me cool for 12 hours is now only around 4 hours. Can’t make it through the night anymore. I understand tolerance so on so forth. But I’m not taking about getting high. It’s not that it was getting me high now it isn’t. It literally was carrying me through the day now it isn’t even getting me past a few hours. I could even understand a few spikes. Say I was used to doing a half G a day and then 2 days in a row I hammered 1.5 or something. But no. Anywhere from .3-.5 a day is all I do. 
So I was just wondering. Has anyone else had these issues and almost lost your fucking mind over it. I laid in bed awake alllllll night last night. Wasn’t sick yet but not comfortable enough to fall asleep. All I could think about was not doing this shit the next day and fitting my other dude that I know always keeps fire. Only problem is he’s one of those ya I’ll be there in 15 mins and it’s 2-3 hours every single time. Well when your sick as fuck and you think your getting cool in the next 15-20. Then a hour goes by. You call. “Ya my bad bro I’m about to pull up” another hour goes by... idk about any of you but that shit has had me ready to lose my fucking shit a few times. So most of the time I just can’t afford to wait like that. Today however I’ve been so irritated and fed up with the last week of this shit. Blowing money everyday not getting right is the worst shit ever. Especially when you depend on getting right to be able to do simple things such as eat. Drink. Sleep. Function. 
Well today I hit my other dude. No answer. Waited an hour. Still nothing. So I’m thinking to myself there’s no way I can wait and hope this dude answers at some point just to wait another few hours for him to pull the fuck up. So I went back and got the same shit that hasn’t worked for me the last week now. 
Has anyone else done this? I mean I feel fucking crazy. The night before when I’m at least not deathly sick but not feeling good still I will sit and say man there’s no way I’m getting this shit again tomorrow it’s not getting me where I need to be blablabla. And then no sooner than 12 hours later you got the same god damn dude coming through because you justify in your mind like well. It at least gets me feeling alright for a little while(just doesn’t have legs at all) so I basically suffice being sick to get right for a few hours. Fully knowing that I won’t make it through the night again. But i guess being “in the moment” of being sick on that shit all you care about is right now. Getting right now. I’m not thinking about sleeping tonight when I’m sick as fuck right now. But idk is that crazy? I mean is it crazy to do that knowing it isn’t doing it for me just because I can’t wait another few hours to get something I know is going to be alright for me? Idk I guess to myself like.... I feel like that’s fucking insane to keep doing to yourself. I mean it’s torture for sure. Because you know like well I’ll be ok for a few hours. But what about after that? The shit is crazy to me the type of suffering you knowingly put yourself through. A lot of times I’ve just thought about shit like man..... even tho withdrawal is the worst shit to go through. At least worse than anything I’ve ever went through I really do feel like with the way this shit has been for me it would be easier to just fucking quit the shit. I can’t stress enough how fucking terrible it feels to start the Hustle at 8 am. Doing whatever you can to get money to get you through the day. As fast as you can before you get sick enough to where you can’t even function enough to hustle. So usually that takes a few hours. Then you gotta make the moves. Then you gotta try and hope your few normal people are around and it isn’t going to be another 2-3-4 hours to wait on them..  so what starts at 8. Finally gets worked out 4-6-8-10 hours later.... just to end up getting something that either doesn’t carry you through or fuck at times I’ve gotten shit that literally wouldn’t even get me off sick. So if you look at it that way I mean... your laying in bed all night trying to sleep. Not feeling well. Getting sicker by the hour. Then you finally make whatever moves or do whatever you have to just to get 40-50-60 dollars to get right. And you end up getting some ducking trash ass shit that doesn’t get you right. Or you fuckin....get something that at least takes your withdrawal away but within 2 hours you already start getting chills and your stomach is already rolling over and shit. I mean motherfucker. Ya know if that just happened once or twice in a week cause bad shit is going around or whatever the reason is it pry wouldn’t be a make or break situation. But when you been trying to quit for literally a solid year and a half now... and your sick 2-3-4 days out of the week. Every week. I mean fuck me. Cause I will go a day or 2. Sometimes even 3 before I fucking break down and use because I can’t handle being that sick for that long. Well when you have done that for a year and a half. I mean the toll that shit has took on my mental status and my body is seriously no joke. It’s given me worst anxiety I’ve ever had in my life. So bad that now when I try to quit I mean I’m lucky if I make it all the way through the first day just because I’m so fucking scared of how horrible shit is going to be for 2 weeks minimum.  Between that and I’ve also secluded myself. When I decided it was time to stop a year and a half ago I started trying and I can’t be around anyone when I’m sick like that. So of course I secluded myself. Well after trying and failing for a month or so I had lost contact with mostly everyone I knew. And the fact that I kept trying I mean before I knew it another 3-4 months had went by of my trying to detox on my own. Being sick half the week and using the other half. That rollercoaster now for the last year and a half has fucked me up so god damn bad I can’t even explain how I feel and shit now. So I was just curious if anyone else has went through the issue of having shit be coo for a week or 2 maybe and then all the sudden not even be able to make it through a night using the same exact shit....idk. I’m always looking for other people’s experiences and shit because sometimes I just feel like god damn. I feel so fucking terrible and I just wonder like man. Has anyone else been in a similar situation to where they have went through something similar and can give me some insight as to what I can do to try and stop the cycle or maybe some context as far as how some of you have felt in a similar situation?

I detoxed are home on 2/24 from a massive opiate addiction that was 10 years in the making. It was the hardest damn thing I’ve ever done. I had to quit my job in order to have the time off and that came with its own struggles. After a few weeks, I started looking for work and then the virus shut everything down, especially in my field. Money was running low, my gym closed, and no jobs were calling me back. The PAWS started getting more and more intense. I forced myself to continue meditation and spent hours every day applying for jobs. I got the call this morning that I have been hired into a good company and will have benefits again in 3 months. I can pass a drug test with my own urine and can’t wait to take that test. I can’t remember the last time I could legitimately pass one. If you’re reading this, just know that it does get better. I promise you that the voice in your head is wrong when you tell yourself that you can’t change. I’m not even close to perfect, but at least now I can work on myself instead of always working on getting high. Much love to you all.",21,1

How are you dealing with finding a job? Did you finish school and did the arrest make your degree moot because it comes up in background checks? Or did you stop thinking about going to school because of the arrest or arrests?

I'm 29 now and the arrests have gotten me super depressed. If you google my full name (since my full name is unique) both my arrests come up with the local news. This has made me not want to go back to school and I've just been jumping around jobs or working for family. The pay is obviously always shit. I had to move back in with my parents after the second arrest to be able to afford my habit. Now I'm getting paid too low to even think about moving out.

Just at a loss of what to do and the depression and anxiety is killing me.

So last night I had a dream about dope for the first time since I stopped using a year ago. Crazy shit, really goes to show that the demon is always lurking. I think I dreamt it because currently I don't have the obligations that were keeping me from wanting to use even one tiny bit, and although I still don't want to on a surface level, subconsciously it doesn't surprise me that my mind is like ""ya know what would be cool right now? Getting high!'  

It was weird though, in the dream I had like found a bag and a half and told R and we were going to split it, but like most dope dreams, people kept like interrupting and we couldn't find a chance to do it. But a big difference from when I was in active use was that in old dope dreams when i was still using, the whole ""have the dope but can't do it"" thing induced like serious panic and anxiety, but in this dream it was more of a minor inconvenience and I even remember thinking in it like ""aw well if I don't get to do it it doesn't really matter, it's not like I'll be sick"". Which I guess is kinda a good thing in and of itself? Idk. Also I typically never really dream, prob from years of smoking weed before bed so that I can fall asleep, but this dream was vivid and memorable which is so damn rare for me.  

Yesterday was actually a good day! My school has started up online again and i had one zoom class and one phone conference call class. I honestly missed my professors and am sad that two of my classes are no longer doing sessions Cuz I really got along with those two profs as well. I didn't realize how much I actually seriously missed school, there was even some classmates of mine I was happy to see/ hear. I woke up early, did my hour of yoga, actually put on makeup and got dressed, did like 5 hours of homework after my classes were done, and then I ordered expensive but delicious BBQ delivery Cuz it was Rs 26th birthday and our third anniversary. Also had really good sex before we went to bed which is always cool. Can't believe this is our fourth year together, shit has been fucked up between us and I still am unsure of if I do want to end this or not, but ofc a part of me does love and care about him a shitton even if I get irritated by him on a day to day basis (quarantine has obv amplified that).  

Anyway. Hope everyone is hanging in there. We got a whole nother month of quarantine now so... we gotta get used to this 😣 I was really not holding my shit together the first two weeks or so but I think school is going to be my saving grace here in giving me some sense of purpose and obligation as well as productivity. What have been some of the main things helping you guys stay sane during quarantine? Anyone started getting into any new hobbies or revisiting old ones? Well, love y'all, stay safe guys, n have a good day 💜",6,3
