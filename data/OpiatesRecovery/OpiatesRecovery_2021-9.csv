[here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/06/18/deep-brain-stimulation-addiction/%3foutputType=amp) is the most recent article about deep brain stimulation surgery where a pacemaker in the chest is attached to electrodes in the brain to help stimulate the reward center as well as the frontal lobe to help with decision making. 

It‚Äôs only been done 3 times. One guy has 2 years clean, the other featured in the nightly news story has like 3 months and is still in sober living. The third relapsed. 

Still super early technology and not much research but seems really cool. The long term paws gets a lot of us and this is designed to mitigate that. 

Right now, I don‚Äôt think I would try it since I‚Äôm on methadone and stable. But if I get off methadone (tapering now) and still feel not great, I might consider it down the line.

 I've been an opiate user for almost 19 years. Started with Oxys, then roxies and chipped for many years with stints of daily use but seemed to pull myself out after a few months, then dive right back in. Then 3-4 years ago the heroin started due to financial issues and how expensive pills were. Then the heroin became straight fent in my area. I was totally consumed, physically and mentally. I just could not detox myself at home no matter what I tried. I couldnt take subs either because of the fentalouges I was using or the other shit mixed in. I even waited 5 full days in a detox and still went into PWD as soon as they gave me a sub on day 5.

In the end it took my wife calling it quits for me to go to rehab, again. I had to cold turkey off of over a 1g of fent a day habit. People said I looked like the walking dead. 48 days later im now back home, got divorce papers the day I got out of rehab. It sucks, bad, but I made the bed I sleep in. I always thought I was just hurting/killing myself but in reality we are doing the same damage to our loved ones. The thought of her choosing drugs and to slowly kill herself over the life we built would have likely made me run long ago. She tried to get me help for years but I thought I could beat my addiction and just put the physical addiction behind me, never looking at the mental aspect or working a program. I guess I needed this type of bottom. 

So yea, life sucks ass right now, but I'm clean and sober so I guess thats cool. I already needed to uproot and change most of my life, why not every single thing while I'm at it. The thought of reengaging socially at 33 has got me fucked up, but now to add on dating/talking to new women sober after being with the same person for 11 years is mind boggling to me. Don't even know where to start. I've had fleeting thoughts of using, not my DOC but like drinking or something just to go out and socialize. When I process those thoughts I realize its not the drugs I want, its these shitty emotions I dont want to feel. Its the loneliness I dont want to feel. But for today, I'm still sober and thats worlds better then being in my active use.

On 21st July I decided to quite taking codeine (co-codamol) after using fairly regularly over a number of years but more recently a few months of pretty consistent use.
I went through the horrendous withdrawals, struggled with the anxiety and depression that comes along with the physical withdrawals. I managed to pull myself out of it and decided I never wanted to go through that again as I literally wanted to die. After a week of physical and mental withdrawals followed by a couple of weeks of anxiety and depression I was doing good.
I had 8 weeks sober under my belt and felt mentally and physically good. 
Unfortunately my stupid fucking brain thought I could dabble without falling back down.
I started buying solpadein max and would take 120mg of codeine each day and thought I was being smart by leaving a day or two in between doses. I thought this would be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and prevent withdrawals. 
This went on for a couple of weeks and then I got a prescription from my doc which had 100 30/500 co-codamol tablets in it. I decided I didn‚Äôt want to risk slipping so decided to stop before it got out of hand (like it hadn‚Äôt already!)
I hadn‚Äôt dose on Thursday and then another on Saturday.
Then withdrawals kicked in on Sunday. Guess I wasn‚Äôt so smart leaving a day or two between doses!
I don‚Äôt want to use again as I‚Äôm back to being in a constant state of panic/anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm supposed to be going on vacation in a few days and I don‚Äôt want to ruin it for my partner by being an anxious depressed mess but I absolutely don‚Äôt want ‚Äúfake happy‚Äù by taking the pills I have.
I honestly don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting but I guess it‚Äôs to try and hold myself accountable for being a fuck up.
Anyone relapsed but not to the extent they used before? Should I expect this anxiety and depression to last for the full 3/4 weeks or will I get off likely and be ok in a few days? I know everyone is different and a lot of people relapse but when I read over my previous posts I genuinely believed at the time I would never use again.

It was terrifying for them to hear and all the sexual trauma that allowed me to rationalize my habit. 
I finally found a clinic and got myself help. I took Suboxone for about a week because that was a requirement in order for me to get a shot of Sublocade in my stomache, which has done wonders for my life and for my relationships. I felt the need to post this because I had never heard of that shot or Vivitrol before and while I probably should have searched this subreddit first, the clinic (Workit) that I visited in 2019 when I first tried to get sober never even mentioned Sublocade or Vivitrol.

I've had zero side effects other than very positive ones like not having to use the bathroom for longer than an hour to get high and the constant agony my parents, family, or friends went through wondering where the f*** I was all the time or why I looked like a zombie. 

When I went in to get my Sublocade shot they asked me several questions and I was told since I had previously woken up with a bloody mouth/my tongue completely chewed up she told me that was indicative of an overdose so I feel lucky to be living. After 3 years of using, I know I have a long road ahead of me filled with clinic appointments and therapy but being free from opiates and the financial burden is completely worth it and I highly recommend anyone who's even thinking about getting off opiates to look into Sublocade. Oh and for what it's worth my withdrawal symptoms were minimal at best and nothing a benzodiazepine can't take care of.

I wanted to get some advice from y‚Äôall. I have been using straight fent for the last 3 years. Anywhere from 1.5-3 grams a day. I make really good money and it‚Äôs just fueled my tolerance getting ridiculous. I remember when I first relapsed an amount a quarter the size of my pinky nail had me od‚Äôd on the bathroom floor. I‚Äôm using the same stuff and now doing quarter to half gram shots of it at a time unphased. 

The biggest thing I‚Äôm afraid of in detoxing is precip withdrawal. I know the standard protocol at most rehabs is bupe and I have tried over 5 different times ranging from 24-60 hours before inducing only to be thrown into precipitated withdrawal every time. I don‚Äôt want to go through that hell ever again. 

My question is, have any of y‚Äôall gone to a rehab or know of one that will do a methadone taper instead of bupe given the circumstance of the fentalogue I‚Äôm using causing precipitated withdrawal even after long abstinence(in full withdrawal; scoring with COWs worksheet)?

So I have been on tramadol 300mg a day for almost a year now. Taken a few breaks and gone through HORRIFIC withdrawal, even on a relatively minor drug and dosage. It has been an absolute bitch. Started taking them due to herniated discs and excruciating pain, while waiting to have cervical disk replacement surgery.
I would take gabapentin to try and help with w/d symptoms which would help somewhat but still brutal.

Just had the surgery finally a week ago. Was prescribed 10mg oxycodone every 4 hours as well as soma 350mg. Haven‚Äôt really been taking the soma but am taking about 50mg of oxy a day for the pain. I timed the tramadol so that I would continue taking it straight up until the night before surgery, so technically I have been detoxing from it while on the oxy. I haven‚Äôt had any opiate w/d symptoms obviously since I‚Äôm taking the oxy but have had the SSRI brain zaps this week. 

I have a long history with opiates for chronic pain, and get dependent quick. So I already a week in after surgery I am getting a little hot when I wake up in the mornings from oxy w/d. I will say, I have come off of oxycodone before and the withdrawal was bad but half the time and intensity of a tramadol withdrawal. 

My question is, I should be on the oxy another week or two. I‚Äôm wondering when I come off of it, will I experience a more intense w/d than a normal oxy w/d because I stopped the tramadol too, or will that have cycled through my system enough by that point to where it will simply be a quick oxy withdrawal? 
I have the soma and gabapentin to help with symptoms, but just wasn‚Äôt sure if I need to expect a super intense withdrawal due to stopping tramadol cold turkey and then immediately taking oxy.

I had a call with a drug treatment worker here in the UK where a lot of these services are charities subsidised by the government and often staffed by ex-users.

He did not seem very keen on the idea of me tapering/detoxing and gave me a pretty hard sell on methadone maintenance. When I said I'd rather quit and was pretty motivated he sort of suggested I'd never do it.

From what I've heard methadone is a disaster - even harder to get off than junk, very sedating and generally makes you feel shit. 

I decided not to use this service and to quit using my own personal resources.

I quit drinking after 30 years of alcohol abuse so I am optimistic I can do the same with opiates. Maybe I'm deluding myself but I'm going to give it a try.

Thing is - why are these services so keen to get you on methadone, etc as maintenance drugs? If I was being cynical I'd say that creating a load of dependent junkies on scripts is a sure fire way of having a job for life. There seems to be no motivation to get people clean.

I was addicted to H for 3 years. I functioned well as it didn't effect finances but I got really depressed out of guilt and started having suicidal thoughts ""my kids will be better without me"", ""eventually I will lose ability to function, people will find out then my kids will be taken off me so better to end it now"". So made a plan to get off and I will be sticking to it no matter what. 

Anyway. I kind of know my stuff with pharms. Kind of. Subs weren't an option because I once went into precipitated withdrawals and I would rather go through childbirth than that again.  Therefore I decided to titrate right down on the H and jump onto dihydrocodeine. I functioned on them for 5 weeks, titrated down to 240ish mg a day. I'm jumped off as I was getting low and I had a week without much on. I'm on day 5. Now day 3 definitely felt pretty hairy, yesterday a bit better, but today I'm worse again. I have taken comfort meds but no opiate based. Is this normal. I'm really worried because I had to take some methadone about 4 days before coming off. Just a tiny amount,.about 5ml, I forgot to take my codeine to work and it was getting a bit obvious. My boyfriend is on a script so had access to some liquid handcuffs in my car. 

I thought I would start getting better by now or do need to be patient. My spine is freezing, similar to day 1/2. I know mdone withdrawals can be loooooong. Which is why I chose codeine. Never took it for longer than 3 days over the last 3 years.

I didn't sober up on purpose- a kink in the supply chain plus an emergency business trip to BFE where all I could find was coke (which I don't enjoy at all) forced a sobriety. I got home yesterday and resisted immediately seeing my dude... but today all I can think about is doing it one last time. I KNOW I can't do that but it's all I can think about today.

Short background- I've been using fentanyl (legit medical 100mcg/h 72 hour patches, smoking) for a year, then stopped for few months, then relapsed two months ago. Last two months was smoking around one patch a day.

I just took my last dose of fent tonight. Im done with it.
I have just acquired 2 lyricas (300mg pregabalin).
Besides this i got like 8 kpins (2mg), 8 clonidines (0.15mg), few imodium pills and 6 brotizolam (0.25mg, a strong benzo usually perscribed for sleep), and magnesium, omega 3 and lots of fruits cuz all I can get into my stomach during withdrawals are smoothies.

Tonight gonna probably sleep well, and gonna wake up straight into withdrawals. Should i wait with the lyrica until things are going south? Never took it so what should i expect?
In general, if anyone has any tips as to when to use what, and just general tips it would be awesome. Thanks a lot to all of you üíì

Important notes: I don't have any money to get anything else, and i have zero access to kratom.

I am a longtime lurker and frequent relapser, but being a few hours away from day 5 I feel better than in the past.

Like many, I started with prescriptions that ended up being bundles of dope. For the first 8-9 years, I was a functioning addict; able to maintain a job, relationship, rent, and everything else. But for the past year, my addiction has only gotten worse. I lost my job, then my fiance and I received enhanced unemployment, so I spent way too much time doing lines and sitting on my couch. 

But here I am, 5 days in, and feeling ok. I went CT, using only edibles, flower, magnesium, and potassium. I have also forced myself to walk everyday and it has helped a lot! Once I get some money (broke at the moment for obvious reasons) I plan on joining a gym and working it into my routine. The withdrawals still suck but as many know the physical aspect is in a way much easier than the following mental challenge. But it is comforting to know that this will also pass.

I‚Äôm just trying to understand what happens after you overdose.

Last night my friend got a new batch of fentanyl, and he told me his friend said it was strong stuff (I was not doing it with him) - and I‚Äôm always super concerned about him OD‚Äôing as he has quite a few times before, but thankfully someone was always around to Narcan him or save him, but I‚Äôve never seen it happen before.

He is an IV drug user, and before he did it I was arguing with him and telling him not to do the whole amount (the whole syringe) all at once. I was telling him that I can‚Äôt save him if he OD‚Äôs, there‚Äôs no narcan, and you don‚Äôt know how strong that is.

I can‚Äôt stop him from doing it, he would of just gone into a public bathroom, so I requested him not to do it privately. Well as he was putting it in he said in an annoyed way ‚Äúmaybe I just shouldn‚Äôt do this in front of you then‚Äù Anyway, unfortunately he ignored me and immediately overdosed.

I violently shook him for several moments and thankfully he woke up, and then immediately went unconscious again and I had to wake him up again. It was horrifying.

But here‚Äôs where my question follows. After he woke up, I was furious and yelling at him, but he didn‚Äôt know what was going on. He didn‚Äôt know where he was, what he was doing, or anything. He was saying things that didn‚Äôt make any sense whatsoever.

I got him to stand up and walk around for 20-30 minutes and eventually he became coherent. I had to explain everything that just happened to him because he couldn‚Äôt remember anything after the overdose.

But here‚Äôs the question, I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs normal when you overdose? You lose your memory and have no clue what‚Äôs going on? Would he have died if I didn‚Äôt wake him up? Or was there still a chance he would of eventually woke up himself?

I almost lost my best friend last night. If I wasn‚Äôt there, I don‚Äôt think he would be alive. I would hope that event would scare him away from the drugs, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it will. That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve cried in many years. He volunteered to go to an AA meeting tonight, and I‚Äôm going to go with him.

Gabapentin 300pmg
Hydroxine pamoate 50mg
Ondansetron 4mg
Tizanadine 4mg
And suboxone 8mg strips but I was told to cut that into 8 smaller pieces 
I also bought magnesium 500mg and vitamin c 1kmg
And have kratom if need be

I want this shit out of me.,"I haven‚Äôt posted for a while because I‚Äôve been in a bit of a mess and haven‚Äôt even been able to put any coherent thoughts together.

Anyway, about 6 or 7 months ago I managed to kick a many years habit of morphine, fentanyl, tramadol etc. I‚Äôd been clean for about a month with a couple of slips, but the PAWS was absolutely killing me. So I had the bright idea of getting some subs from the dark web and just taking 0.5mg a day to make me feel ok.

Obviously I regretted my decision within a week or so because I thought I‚Äôd just be able to take the 0.5 each morning and then forget about it and get on with my life until the next day. Unfortunately that dose was too low to last me more than 8 hours so I was having to split the dose three times daily, which defeated the fucking object.

Then we all know where this is going, I started taking more on some days when I was stressed and so on. My average dose probably crept up to 0.75mg a day.

My final three daily doses were about 1mg with my last dose on Monday morning. I didn‚Äôt start to feel sick until the next day. It‚Äôs now Thursday (day 4) and I feel extremely exhausted and depressed, with zero appetite. However I haven‚Äôt had any of the other usual symptoms.

I know subs take a long time to leave your system, but does this still apply to an average daily dose of 0.75mg (as opposed to the normal dose of 8-16mg).

What I‚Äôm asking is are my symptoms not so bad due to the long half life of the subs or due to the shit loads of clonidine, alprazolam (Xanax) and pregabalin I‚Äôm taking as comfort meds?

I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm going to have these medium intensity symptoms but for a really long time. If that makes sense? I can only take a couple more days off work.

EDIT: there‚Äôs no point in me just staying on the subs because they fucked with my head in a way I can‚Äôt quite describe. I feel like I was just as miserable on them as I was when I was off everything and had bad PAWS.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994632601737976}"

Started on methadone but it was self pay and made me gain weight, so then I went to a medicaid clinic and started the suboxone strips, hated the taste, so my Dr put me on Zubsolv. Zubsolv is tiny and has a mint taste. I was doing so well on it for years. All of a sudden, Medicaid refused to fill my Zubsolv, and told me I had to try a bunch of other bupe meds before they would approve the Zubsolv. I was so upset. Here I am, 6 years sober, perfectly stable on Zubsolv for years, and Medicaid decides they want to mess with my recovery. Well, I've already tried methadone and sub strips so that left Suboxone pills and Subutex. 

Been on Sub pills for less than a week and they are HUGE, take forever to dissolve and taste DISGUSTING. Worst of all, the pill is so big, the liquid is reaching my lower gum area and irritating my gums and between my teeth so badly, it hurts to eat!

Saw my Dr today, and he sympathized with me and said he would try his best to get Subutex to go through. Just before the pharmacy closed, we called and found out that Medicaid did approve it but that it probably wouldn't be ready until tomorrow.

I just had a couple of questions.

1. I am on 4mg of the subs twice a day, but I usually only need one pill in the am to hold me. I notice subutex only comes in 2mg and 8mg. Will I have to take 2 2mg pills?
2. Are the pills any smaller than suboxone pills and do they taste better?
3. Do you get any mood lift without the Naloxone? Is there any differences that you can see not having the Naloxone?

Fent use / withdrawals and about to go on a trip.,"I fucked up and used fent for about 3-4 months. For the past month I've been tapering powdered fent. Smoked. I've been taking a day off here, two days off there, for about a month. Last week I only used two times in the whole week. So it's basically been like a whole month of withdrawals. Well yesterday was the 48 hour mark and I was feeling pretty good and I have a music festival coming up so I figured, fuck it. It would be SO NICE to not have to hide my fucking opiate addiction while I'm stuffed in an RV with friends and family. So today is day three and I think I'm on the pink cloud. When I told my friend this, he said, ""yeah right dude, fent withdrawals don't even START until day 4 you're gunna be FUCKED for your vacation."" It's got me a bit nervous, but I've quit before and I just FEEL like my body is creating feel good chemicals again. I've been taking all sorts of vitamins the past week. Tons of vitamin C and D. Plus a Creatine complex that has 5-HTP L-Theanine, Ashwanganda, etc etc etc. I get the occasional cold sweats / hot flashes, but other than that, I'm feel pretty good. My friend, (who happens to be the one who sells me fent, but he's a good guy I swear), is telling me I should take some with me just in case. But I have one 8mg sub I decided to source instead. My thought is that if I start to feel like shit I can just start chipping away at the sub.

But something's just... different. I'm not yawning. No diarrhea (although it's soft stool), no leaking eyes, no sneezing. I've been praying for a miracle to finally be done with with this and I feel like I've been given a free pass. I have a fast metabolism and I've been exercising. Just the excitement for this trip has got me in such a great mood and I've worked SO hard the past month to stop using daily. I feel like that was my saving grace. Like I trained my brain that it doesn't ALWAYS get fetty so on some days you just gotta make your own chemicals, and now I have NO desire to EVER go back to using. I've had NO cravings the past three days and I don't want to EVER go back so if it's too good to be true, well then it might be? Maybe someone else has had this experience before?

But now I'm second guessing myself and think that maybe he's right.

On the other hand, being around friends and just listening to music and dancing the night away sounds like the perfect way to trick my brain into having feel good chemicals. I admit I will probably be drinking and taking some shrooms, although I've told myself I need to not go hard.

Basically, i've used 100mg-150mg of tramadol for a whole month: its mild opiate effects and it's SNRI action pretty much managed to keep me alive during some really dark times. 

I've tried to taper, but due to tolerance building up and its dual effects, i felt miserable and i was left without energy: i woke up today and i quite literally had to crawl on the floor to the kitchen. 

I had a little bump of speed and things like piloerection, low energy, total letargy, constant aggressive behaviour ecc they all seemed to have faded away for the moment. Im not planning to redose or anything: just three little intranasal lines seem to work for the moment. I had some experience with being overamped and jesus christ i don't want to experience that ever again, so yeah, not planning to abuse it/use it as a replacement or whatever; just using it as it if were a low dose of adderall (another medication we don't have access to in my country). 

I don't feel ""hyper"", i don't feel ""super"" or happy or whatever; just really mildly stimulated, enough to not feel like a complete zombie. I actually feel quite calm. I've tried benzos (for which i have a prescription for) but they just don't work: i ended up feeling worse; depressed, unable to fall asleep, and unable to think properly; GABAergic substances just don't seem to work in a positive way for me anymore. 

So, does anyone have any experience with kicking withdrawals through the use of low doses of stimulants? How did it ended up for you? And how much time do tramadol withdrawals last when used for a month? 

Thank you guys: i know we shouldn't encourage using other drugs in a sub about recovery, so in case this post is against the rules, please feel free to delete it.

so a few months ago i got addicted to fent and was on a bender for about 3 months then i went to and then got out of rehab like 2 months ago. Before that i was just a pothead and psychedelic tripper who did this and that when it came up but i never truly felt addiction till the fent. I was sober all of 2020 and started taking xanax january this year to sleep then stopped then jumped to those dirty 30's.

i got sober in 2020 cause i reconnected with an old best friend (i cut her out of my life like twice i think) and i saw how well she was doing in life and how stagnated i was and on top of that too i wanted to impress her (not gonna lie, ive always likes her). so i got sober left my family's in march moved down to california to connect with my mom and siblings and live with my mom. Mom told me she was doing really well had a cool boyfriend and her own place (shes been a heroin addict since i was 7) she told me she was on subs things were great and told me to come down and bring my dog and we'll figure things out (shes estranged from her entire family and has no contact with her children because shes a fucking junkie) so i did.

The day i get there im holding my dog in my arms (a 10 month pitbull) and the first thing her boyfriend says to me when i open the door to her house is ""oh you cant have your dog here"". I tell him ""okay i just drive 20 hours to get here can we figure this out in the morning?"" so i get inside to what we be my room and my mother is strung out passed out on ""my"" bed. i turn the light on and she freaks out pushes me aside and goes and lies down on the couch. Needless to say the house is fucking trashed btw. i facetimed my mom and talked to her boyfriend prior about the dog and the house wasnt this trashed before and all of this is a fucking headtrip, theres was dildos and other sex toy shit all over my room and the sheets were stained in blood and it was wild. so i grabbed a blanket out of my bag and put it on the bed and passed out.

needless to say she never got on subs never got clean and was using me for money and to cause problems between her boyfriend and her. at one point they tried getting my car stolen to pay off someone they owed money too. My mother wanted me to tell my 18 year old sister that her deceased father ( he overdosed in november 2019) used to beat my mom when they were together (she wanted me to tell her that when i went to see her for ther first time in years) because shes mad her family wont let her see her daughter even though her dad was an addict as well.

My best friend was so fucking happy for me to come down. we had so much planned and obviously i told her if things werent working with my mom id figure something out but tbh i snapped. i cane down to cali to start anew when covid started and to bring a broken family a together. how insane and delusional was i? so after being woken up at 3am to my mom and her boyfriend screaming at eachother over who took whos dope and ""wheres my lotto card"" i kinda snapped. i texted homegirl and said ""things are working with my mom and i think im gonna move back to washington"" and she just told me do whatever makes me happy then. Personally i think shes cold as fuck and i just needed someone to talk to and got turned down and yeah. so i packed my shit up and left with my dog.

made it back to oregon and was so depressed. my family is something else (my uncle accused me of having an affair with his fiance a fee months before i left for cali, dads an addict, grandpa is sketchy potential molestor with possible warrants, grandma is a sweetheart but in a stte of delusion) and i was so depressed i just started compulsively gambling. i was really just trying to push myself to kill myself but i never could do it. 

anyway after a few months i had a major fallout with my uncle again so i left and started to sleep in my car then i stayed at a coworkers then i moved back to cali.

this whole time ive been talking to my best friend but she git more and more distant as i had left cali. and absoluty more distant when i slept in my car. 

stayed with my moms uncle for a week before he locked me out (hes an ex tweeker and i think he thought some shit idk) and slept in ny car from october 2020 to febuary 2021 when i git an apartment. i worked two jobs (im a bartender) one at a county club and one at a casino to get my place. 

after three months of sleeping in my car and having nobody to talk to i tried to shoot myself in my head on january 3rd. posted it on snapchat but couldn't pull through with it. best friend freaked the fuck out called the cops and i had to do a wellness check. she told me we were gonna talk about it but we never did, she just stopped talking to me more and more.

and then i gof addicted to fent because i started kicking it with an old old friend. i let him move in with me because his mom had just kicked him out. i got a new car gave him my old one and there i was. he lost the car because he got fucked up and got arrested driving it. i had to pay the tow fee because it was still in my name and yeah.

so anyway this and that happens and now here i am. i kicked out my roommate, he freaked out tried to kill himself after he tried to OD so i talked with him and his mom and he convinced hinself to go to rehab and then after that hes gonna move in with his mom. hes there now.

ive been three months clean off fent. i have a sponsor i go to AA. i was in ny fourth step then had a mental breakdown and now im restarting them. 

i feel completely insane and like everytging is just delusional thinking. im a very very social guy as a bartender i get along with all types of people, my coworkers love me, my managers are fighting over where to put me and my regulars love me. but as soon as im alone i want to kill myself. i feel alone. no family no friends no reason to live. when i came down here i had purpose i wanted to do something. i wanted family i wanted ti see my bestfriend and do do everytging we had planned and that was all just delusional thinking. insanity. its just me in an alien world that consists of nothing but suffering.

AA makes me feel a little better but the fourth step made me realize im fucked in the head. i dont even want to use, i just want to kill myself, i hate me and i hate this hell ive made for myself. I dont wake uo saying i wont use today i wake up talking myself out of putting a bullet in my head. 

the onky time im not thinking like that is when im at wirk at aa or at the gym. i even quit smoking watching porn jerking off and energy drinks or at least i try my best to abstain.

and yeah i do feel something sexual towards my best friend (if shes even my friend at this point) but ive always felt a mutuak attraction and it definiteky used to be that way idk about now. that i wont lie does totally cloud my judgement.

i text her a huge thing when i was in fent and she flipped out at me and i wont lie im codependent and she called me out and ill never forget all the shit she said. but to be fair she always told me i can talk to her and shes never let me talk to her about whats bothering me or maybe she has and my broken brain is just broken and i dont get things idk.

i just dont want ti suffer just to suffer anymore. thanks for lettibg me share

oh and to add i ran into my mom at the casino when i went in for a job interview and we talked i apologized for being who i am and we went over to her place. this is a long story so ill sum it up. she wanted me to commit capitol fraud by pretending ti be someone else to steal their credit card info, she git fucked up on heroin and xanax and was so high she held me hostage because she coukdnt find her purse which had 20k on it from unemployment money she scammed teh government out of, she handed me her dildo because she thought it was funny it had dog bites on it, and she threatened to send people after me after loading my car with stolen shit.

""Oh I've been through insane benzo withdrawal before"" or ""Yeah I've seen this but at 70mg for a couple days. It'll just be a mild that""


nonononono nottt the case.

Holy were my legs ever cramped up last night. I'd constantly be stretching them so I could get even 5 second of relief. It was truly torturous. I could barely breath, and just felt like major dog shit.

Today though? Better. Last night I ate a handful of ASA, zopiclone, and some extra of my prescribed Seroquel. Found all my shit thrown around the floor, but at least I woke up feeling better.

Today, I'm just trying to get my environment as clean as humanly possible, as there's no chance of that in the coming days I would imagine.

Anyways, fuck this, man. I've been tapering myself for a couple months now, but would've definitely liked to come down to 10 or so before jumping off 100%

I'm not going back though. If this is how it's played out for me to get off of it, this is the way it's gonna be. I've got some kratom coming this week, so that will help me with not being at my wit's end 100% of the time

Goog luck for anyone else out there on a taper!


4:48

I've taken about 45mcg of EiPLA. I have been micro dosing with it all day, too. (5mcg's ish)

I haven't tripped in a long time, and this stuff is smooth. Plus I have a very long history of going on trips while in withdrawal, and it's always felt like a refreshing break.

I'm going to clean my room as much as I can, cuz clean room = clean mind = clean trip environment. It's nice doing it up here, cuz my rents know I'm in a rough ways, so I can have my room as my own little universe for right now. But I must get it cleaned. So,


Day 2, 3 nights:
I'm actually starting to feel a tiny bit better. I stole more zopiclone last night, which I feel horrible about. I don't want to have to take something like that just to have an okay sleep. Honestly it's why I think it's going so well, because I've been able to sleep through the nights. Not just sit there. Fat cold sweat, shivering like crazy, with the worst leg pains. Fuck that. I'm down to get off methadone, but I've gone through enough withdrawal for a few lifetimes. Just get me out, please.

I actually made the effort to try n make plans w/ the girl who's growing for me. That's how good I feel. That I can actually socialize n not just sit there like a fucking zombie.

Honestly thank fucking Christ for dabs/rosin. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't smoke as much as I do. It's certainly made the easier. Especially for my guts/stomach.

I just want it to be done. I have 150g's of kratom coming that will be my finisher. Or honestly, if it doesn't come by Wednesday, I'll just sell it to a friend. Why get addicted to something else when I'm this close, right?

While my legs won't let up, and I even have to have surgery on them, I think I'm pretty good otherwise. Anyone else have visual distortions though? That was something new to experience. Looking at an 8 and being unable to tell the difference between it and a 3

Odd

Fuck I just want to be done already. But I know this shit lasts. Hopefully I can switch the physical dependency to kratom, then CT off that

Unfortunately I stopped taking it and ended back on opiates, due to multiple kidney stones. Around 80mg a day of oxy..for 2 months straight... 20mg each time I'd take it... I only have 2 pills remaining which equates to 20mg. The only potential *comfort meds* I have are as follows. Promethazine, 5-5mg valiums, Ambien, and weed. I did pick up a bit of Kratom again just to lessen the blow.. Do I need to be in full blown *hell* withdrawal to begin taking the Kratom? Also, rather than taking my full 20mg oxy dose would I get any relief from the current withdrawal I'm in by splitting those 2- 10mg oxy up?? Or would I still just be miserable in the long run?

Gonna have a friend to kick with, he's x of a couple of years of drinking.

However, I'm a little concerned. The times when I've actually had a lot of success with detoxing has usually been when I've ffucked up my life significantly. -Getting injured, or robbed, losing friends, putting my partner at risk - shit that I can take accountability for that makes me want to stop doing dope.

This time I've got nothing like that. I've managed to keep my usage at around twenty bucks a day, I came sort of close to irritating a couple of friends but I took their criticism well and now I check my behavior all the time when I'm using and I've actually managed to retain some empathy instead of just being a cold brick.  The only real reason I'm quitting is for my girlfriend who just hates me doing down because she doesn't ""like watching me hurt myself."" 

But even that we've discussed at length and it's not because it's affecting my b behavior or making me a dick, or being uninvested in the relationship, She just has a strong cognitive bias against t street drugs (but she's OK with me using prescription amphetamines, opioids, etc.  

Anyway that's all really, just wondering if anyone's got any tricks up their that might make me absolutely loathe fentanyl? Cuz right now I'm pretty impartial to quitting ... I know I'll get through my detox, but unless I have that ""ugh, fuck  Fetn"" mindset I'm worried I wont last long. sober/

This is because d-phenylalanine is a inhibitor of the enzyme that breaks down enkephalins. 

Enkephalins are basically endorphins, but bind to both the mu and delta opioid receptors with a preference for the latter, while endorphins are more selective towards the mu. Enkephalin administered from outside the body by injection is considerably more potent than morphine, but it breaks down very quickly since it's an amino acid peptide making it unsuitable to be a medication (unfortunately most of our naturally occurring neurotransmitters and hormones suffer this fate, either that and/or don't cross the blood brain barrier). 

L-phenylalanine is biosynthesized into norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and trace amines. An excess of l-phenylalanine will block other amino acids that use the transporter creating an excess of these helpful neurotransmitters. 

L-phenylalanine is also an alpha-2-delta calcium channel blocker like gabapentin and a mild NMDA antagonist. 

It's not as perfect as it may sound but it does give mild relief (imagine getting a baby dose of morphine, ketamine, and amphetamine along with gabapentin ... Wouldn't that be nice ... This isn't it but close and looks like it could be on paper). 

Unfortunately I haven't even tracked my dose I was so sick I just stuck my hand into the bag of pure powder and ate it (amino acids aren't really bitter, and d-phenylalanine is actually slightly sweet). It's not toxic so I was like fuck it a small handful I don't even wanna see how much that is.

I'm currently on 2.4mg of Subutex daily and reducing monthly, I started on 24mg and I feel fine.

I've tried to go cold turkey but due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, I was feeling the withdrawals weeks after my last dose.

My plan is to, when I get to a low enough dose of bupe, switch to another opiate with a short half-life so the withdrawals don't last as long and so I get through them quicker. I plan to do this when I'm on less than 0.4 mg of bupe, although I plan to go even lower than 0.4mg of bupe.

My question is which opiate should I switch to with a short half-life and with the least intense withdrawals. I don't mind what opiate it is as long as it fits the criteria of having a short half-life.

If you could provide multiple options just in case one of them isn't available to me at the time that would be great.

I didn't feel nothing but just all off 

So fast forward June 1 u for into some trauma where I got punched on the head out of the blue and started gushing from my nose but I don't remember if I was hit in the nose or not 

The I went home smoked some weed for about three days and also slept a lot.... thinking I was just traumatized and wanted a break I thought I was fine and just wanted some time .... I also had kinda forgot about oxys and did not wanna use at all cause I don't depend on things really to get me threw stuff and didn't think of them as something that makes your problem disappear and masked ... so I didn't do or think about them just about my situation..
.
June 5 I started felling realy weird and jittery and I couldn't focus at all and felt so much anxiety beyond this world along with diarrhea nausea felling too dizzy everything I stood up heart reacing ,congestion, couldn't breath,twitching ,drained,can't sleep and in agony almost like my mind and body doesn't match , can't even watch TV ,feeling like I'm going to die , some nose bleeds and my boogers had blood always, Neck inflammation , feeling mad tired , bad stomach cramps , every system in my body felt of ,0 apitite  not even for water ...

So then around June 10 it got really bad so I went so stay with a friend who had prescribed oxy she offered me one for relief and I refused bit in the end I took it 10mg and felt relaxed and that feeling of euphoria  I guess so I watched TV.....I also smoke Marijuana so let me mention that from June 1 to that time Marijuana started looking its effect but that day I took the oxy I felt good to smoke again ....so I didn't take another at all for 3 more months  thinking my current state would pass and that it want due to oxys 

During those 3 months I went to docs and stuff to find out what Is wrong with me and got prescribed hydroxyzine and also otc meds 
All in which are starting to loose it effects as time goes on I only look the hydroxide some times and I was OK in the beginning but now it's doesnt work at all really 

So me being fed up and wanting relief and also to see if oxy is realy my problem I got 1 and took it and alL, I felt was calm and nauseous and my breathing was a Lil better I watched TV but couldn't rea.ly go fully threw I got no sense of euphoria  or that everything is gonna be alright feeling , weed is still blahhh , I can't taste or smell properly my bones hurt still considering this is supposed to be a pain killer too , I get these headaches where it feels like I'm getting stabbed in the head and I'm still depressed and anxious 

The docs referd me to a therapist who says it's trauma but I'm honestly not traumatized any more and barley think about it except the fact that I feel like this for no reason it so much pressure in my head and I feel like I'm gonna die , 

Iv heard people who used for 6 months and was able to make it out and enjoy life so I waited those 3 months paitently and just tried my best to do things and go out but  I become really hopeless because there's been 0 improvement and I only used for 3 months with some breaks in between and that was my first experience with anything other than weed so I know I'm not supposed to feel like this after 3- 4 months  without it , and if it was the problem that if I take it again I should feel normal at least and no symtoms of withdraw ..but no I still feel like shit just a calm shit ...and as I said my tolerance was good cause June 10 when I took the10 MG I felt it ...3 months later nothing wtf  I can't even be a functional adict if I wanted to 

I don't know what's happening  to me at this point not even tylenol  works .... was I ever going threw withdraw or is this something bigger due to a punch in the head ?

I feel really good today. Yesterday was the first day of little to no physical withdrawal but was still feeling pretty depressed. Yesterday was also my first day without Kratom (trying not to rely on it because I have become addicted to Kratom in the past). I hung out with two of my really good friends last night who haven‚Äôt touched anything harder than shrooms and my spirits were so high. I felt normal when I was hanging out with them and it really gave me even more strength to kick this habit. I opened up to them about what I got myself into the last month (they had no idea I would ever do something like fentanyl) and it felt really good to open up about it to them and get their feedback. Last night was just really cool i felt happier than I ever did the past month I was using it was genuine happiness because I was sober! That feeling of doing something that makes you feel happy without having to be high is the greatest feeling in the world let me tell you. Think I‚Äôm gonna hit an AA meeting today too. I just wanna say thank you to all the kind people who have been commenting on my posts with words of motivation and messaging me to help me get through it. We can do this!!!

I had asked those of you interested to please watch the videos or at least the first few of them and provide your opinion. I noticed I received a lot of negative feedback about the so-called ""blame"" of opioid use disorder. I will not call it an addiction I refuse however that doesn't mean I don't see in shades of grey where Dr Smith tends to see in shades of black and white in his videos. Yes we are all consenting adults and yes we could have stopped it anytime however when we did try to stop we were faced with symptoms that we now call withdrawals that were more than uncomfortable they were sometimes unbearable. Now when I first started taking opioids no one explained this phenomenon to me. And to prove my point more I was in nursing school at the time that big pharma was pushing pain as the fifth vital sign. In order to be accredited by JCHOA hospitals had to show that they were not only assessing but treating pain aggressively. In fact even the wording that was used in school at the time was nothing more than propaganda from pharmaceutical companies. We now know this all because of the lawsuits that big pharma has had to pay out billions of dollars to help fund the fight of the current opioid crisis that they created. So yes I do put a lot of blame on big pharma and a lot of blame on the greedy doctors but I do put some blame on myself too. That's where I differ from the videos and that's where a lot of you were very upset that in recovery you have to take responsibility for your actions in order to get your life back. And I've done that I've accepted my responsibilities but I'm also very pissed off that I wasn't informed. I was not able to make an informed decision I was not given all the information available. So I'm going to post the opioid monologue videos again however I'm also going to include a couple studies that are currently being done on epigenetics and the change that chronic opioid use has caused in our DNA. I am currently in a study I have provided my own DNA and my DNA has been methylated by long-term opioid used disorder. Changes in our DNA not only affect us but they also affect our offspring we pass these changes onto our children that's what makes it so important in my eyes. So again instead of just posting the videos I also wanted to post some current research that's being done in the field of epigenetics it's very interesting at least to me because I enjoy the science of it. I invite all of you to read the articles post your opinions positive and negative I want to hear it all. And if you would like to be part of this study please let me know and I will be happy to put you in touch with the right people. Thank you!

I wanted to quit them ""cold turkey"".  No tapering, I'm not good for that.  My plan is to take bupropion (for dopamine), venlafaxine (for serotonin and norepinephrine), clonazepam (for insomnia and anxiety), or pregabalin.

Even if you didn‚Äôt read my prior post on me looking for advice on how to successfully detox off this awful pill, I wanted to share in hopes it would help someone. 

It has been now over a week since I had my last dirty 30. I had gotten down to doing four a day. Now I know some of you will not be able to access all the comfort meds that I have, but try to get as much as you can. 

I did the methadone rapid detox. I was still seeing my pain doctor few months ago and my oxy prescription was no longer helping me because the dirty 30s ruined my tolerance. So I told my pain doctor that I wanted to switch to methadone. I ended up saving about 120 mg methadone tablets during that time because I was just using the dirty 30s. So I had a bottle of methadone, a bottle of Oxy, a bottle of gabapentin ( gabapentin is so crucial during withdrawals), and a bag of Kratom.  Having a little benzo or ambien to sleep gave me a good nights rest. The plan was to use the methadone for a week or less, then use OXY to come off the methadone, and then use the Kratom. I‚Äôve used Kratom on and off over the years and honestly I am OK with having to stay on that long term. I just went off these pressed pills.

I started the methadone the day after I took my last pill. I just did a low dose of 40 mg split up during the day. And the next day I believe I did 10 mg more than the first. In the next two days were the hardest so I bumped it up to 60 and 70. The following morning I felt 20 mg was enough and I didn‚Äôt have to read those in the evening. And the last morning I took it, yesterday, I only took one 10 mg pill. I have taken no methadone today. When I woke up this morning I had such a clear head, it felt amazing. As the day went on I got just a little uncomfortable and took one dose off oxy and that‚Äôs it. 
I know I may not be out of the woods yet, but I was able to get up and do light housework today.
I also took vitamins and supplements throughout the week and will continue to do so. Magnesium is very important. 

I stayed in bed most of the week. I just felt weak & dizzy when I would stand up. In the past when I was detoxing off real oxy, I have passed out a few times. One time resulting in an ambulance ride because I busted my head open and was on conscience when my husband found me. So this week I listened to my body and if I feel dizzy I just lay the hell down! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

I couldn‚Äôt find a lot of information when I started to prepare for my detox. I just wanted to give somebody Hope that a rapid detox using Methadone short term is possible. 

oh, one more thing. I never did this before this week, never heard of it before this week. But YouTube has a lot of binaural beats for addiction and repairing dopamine and receptors. You need to use earbuds for them to work the best. And I really think it was a key to my success. You can read all the comments on the YouTube videos and see how many people binaural beats have helped.

Oxy is my DOC for physical and mental relief / ""escape"". Hydro does practically nothing for the pain except take the worst edge off but I have endometriosis and a bone lesion which cause debilitating pain daily so it's necessary to continue at this time if I don't want to go to the ER screaming. In other words, I use as prescribed for real medicinal purposes.

Without oxy I feel so much more mentally clear, motivated, and emotionally stable. I am learning to process actual feelings and long buried grief. I'm not sleeping all day, and when it's time for bed I do get a normal 6-8 hours usually. I take ~3.5 to 4 mg melatonin and it usually knocks me out. 

I have been accomplishing so much in the past 2 weeks, including undertaking a major decluttering of my living space. All in all I feel pretty damn good mentally and emotionally.

Physically, it's hard because the oxy is much stronger for pain relief and so I have to supplement the hydro with Tylenol, and god knows how my liver is gonna suffer. I am unable to take any NSAIDS due to medical contraindications, btw. But I feel like this discomfort is the price I must pay to lead a safer, stabler life.

Of course, it would be nice to get down to zero hydro, but for now, for me, this is a major progression. Going to continue trying alternative pain relief options (also keep in mind, unable to walk due to neuro disease, so, exercise options are limited). I've tried cannabis and I have nothing against it but it doesn't relieve my pain and it just makes me tired and a bit foggy, and HUNGRY, so that doesn't help my situation. 

Since these 15 days have been like a very slow tapered withdrawal, I'm not being too gung-ho about cutting out other stuff cold turkey, but as I go forward I am making healthier diet choices and getting better foods and hydration in me.

Today I had an assessment with a local drug and alcohol addiction service and owing to the fact I take the painkillers as is (and not using cold water extraction), they‚Äôve agreed to put me on Methadone as soon as possible.

I am hoping someone can tell me what to expect when I start taking the Methadone? Are there any side effects?

But I have so much going for me that I am going to excel so fucking hard that this little misstep won‚Äôt even be a small chapter in my life. So this is my short but hopefully relatable story. 

I‚Äôm 22, take a look at my profile - I am so blessed to have everything I need to go far and I am deeply ashamed for slipping. I‚Äôve dabbled in things here and there since I was 17 but the opiate use really picked up during COVID. It went from once a month to once a week for a long while with benzos in between and then opiates everyday. Started getting oxys from my friends and quickly turned to dirty blues. 

‚ÄúI only used for a short time‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hurting nobody‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not affecting any areas of my life‚Äù 

Telling yourself these things are signs that the drugs are doing their jobs: slowly weaseling it‚Äôs way into your daily life until one day you‚Äôre at rock bottom and wondering why. I knew going down the path of daily use was shoving problems I had now for later. After having my work, relationships, own body, and especially family suffer through this addiction, I was eventually forced to stop and detox. My parents knew what was up seeing my face in my bowl every night and little did I know my mom would be staying up watching over me while I slept to make sure I was still breathing. And despite that, I am remarkably lucky to be able to have the support to face everything and quit. I would  never be able to do what I‚Äôm doing without everyone‚Äôs support. I always thought I was alone in the sense that getting help was embarrassing so I would never in a million years have asked those around me to helpI‚Äôve put everything and everyone around me through my own problems and caused them so much stress. My daily habit was only for a month but I did use often throughout the last few years and Withdraws are really killing me. Can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt eat, can‚Äôt drink water. Everything that goes down seeming comes back up in twice as much amounts. Can‚Äôt even lay there after work and chill cause my whole body feels like it‚Äôs aching and vibrating. I thought I‚Äôd been through some shit and it would just be a little uncomfortable since my DAILY habit was only a month but physically I am far gone. But mentally I am there.

To anyone young like me and bored and inquisitive looking to start, don‚Äôt. I thought I would be the one exception to all the horror stories you hear about addicts and this hell of a WD that I am in the midst of has really taken my ego down a notch. If you were that superhuman who could just use it here and there without it ever beginning to look like a problem, you probably wouldn‚Äôt be browsing this sub like I used to and tell myself ‚Äúat least it‚Äôs not THAT bad‚Äù. 

And to those of you who‚Äôve been in this vicious cycle for longer without being so goddamn lucky to have people forcefully snap you back in line: as per usual, I am always available to talk be it about using, arbitrary things in life, or even build a deeper relationship. I want to be for you what those currently in my life are for me - unconditionally loving, resilient, and genuinely with your best interests at heart. 

If you want above average things in life you have to do above average work.

If you guys don't wanna read through or aren't bothered about how I'm feeling on a daily basis then fine, I'm mainly doing this for my own viewing so I can see how much progress I am making and how Im feeling. Im hoping this blog/diary helps at lest 1 person with their addiction and give them the confidence to get onto substitutes like methadone as soon as possible as in my opinion is a better drug than heroin in every way, I will get into the details in this day 1 post...

I have been taking painkillers for 3 years now, first year was tramadol, I loved the shit I could game for 12 hours straight on a strip of 10 Tramadol but that turned into daily use which 30x50mg a day was really fucking my stomach lining so I switched to Morphine... Ahh Morphine. there was something about crushing a 60mg pill and either snorting it or smoking it (I've never once in my life used anything IV/IM I'm far too scared of needles). After it was harder for me to get hold of morpiine as I was getting them all from friends and online they're expensive as fuck, so you know the only contender left that's cheap and powerful... HEROIN. Some people are obviously go weird about the face I only ever snorted it never IV smoked couple times but im finding it hard to chase the dragon and waste half my gear. Anyway my life has been wake up take heroin every 4 hours smoke some weed and fall asleep... Such an unhealthy lifestyle and then Benzos joined in the party. Benzos are my superman drug Ive got extreme social anxiety so can't ever make friends or even my own mother I find hard to speak to it was growing in me like a cancer. The Benzos saved my life I wake up every day pissed off I didn't die in my sleep but Benzos are showing me the light I've been outside every day made over 10 new friends in 2 weeks using them (I take not genuine loose Xanax V2090 2mg Bars, Green (hulk) S903s 3mg and also loose valium DAN5620s all these pills are far stronger than the Pharma grade as the Xanax is made with Flualprazolam not Alprazolam and I'm pretty sure the valium is made with Diclazepam or something they're just very more potent and euphoric analogues of the usual Alpraz and Diazepam so 4 valium and I'm KOd and that's with a ruthless tolerance.)

Gone off track a bit but I'm taking Benzos not for fun but as medication for my mental health and its a life saver if used correctly. Today I had My last massive line of heroin, got myself down to the chemist and has my first dose if Methadone. Im so relieved that I'm finally doing something about my heavy drug problems but there is definitely something deeper going on.

Anyway I'm counting this as my first day clean and on the substitutes, I feel great. Not much craving at all except when using Benzos for anxiety it makes me nod and get reeky drowsy so I've picked up 1.5g of coke to keep me up and productive.

Im not looking for a medal or anything close to that Im just proud of myself taking this first step and I want show as many people as possible what drugs actually do to lives. Im 23 and feel like I'm going to die at any moment, I'm glad I called the clinic and got onto Methadone my first big step :)

Thanks for listening guys sorry for rambling so long ill be doing one of these daily to update myself mainly and whoever cares how I'm feeling and hopefully urge others to book an appointment at a clinic.

I have a good heart, I‚Äôm kind, and I‚Äôd love to be there for family and friends.  My addiction does not care, it laughs at how I feel.  It enjoys my misery.  It smiles when I cry‚Ä¶anything that brings me closer to using.  My eyes get dialled in, my heart rate increases, and if anyone actually saw me..they would say it's similar to a fighter walking in a ring....INTENSE.

Learn your triggers.  Mine are loneliness and with COVID my dating life crashed due to girls not wanting to go out as much and the isolation got me to because I got complacent.  So now...I call one family member a day to make sure I am NOT feeling alone. (aka...know your opponent).

Lastly...if you are reading this and you think ""I am NOT a fighter"", I CANNOT be like this guy.  BULL FUCKING SHIT.  We choose our attitudes every day.  I have many different mindsets and I can be emotional and irrational...I need to focus on having the mindset I CAN vs I CANNOT.

I hope this helps someone.

Someone asked what songs pump me up.  Here's one...Hippie Sabatage - Trust Nobody.  I don't know why, it makes this white suburban guy feel hood and strong. lolol. 

""'Cause we don't trust nobody  
We don't even trust our minds  
Losin' everybody

I was always gettin' high

TL:DR just a vent about relapsing and hoping that getting on meds for my bipolar disorder will make it easier for me to drop this habit for good.


Hi there, I‚Äôm new to this subreddit, and really opening up about this in general. I‚Äôve been stuck with opiates for almost 4 years now, started with oxy and just bounced around different pharm pills, I got down to like 2.5 mg of hydro a day almost a year or so ago now, and I was able to maintain that for months. Really then taking it was more of the mentality of feeing weird not taking anything as opposed to really needing it. Then I fell into PAWS and just slipped with my life circumstances going on at the time too. 

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar II before and have been unmedicated throughout my whole addiction. Lately I‚Äôm on 20-30 mg of hydrocodone a day.

A few weeks ago I used some guanfacine (similar to clonidine) I had lying around to dramatically taper down over the course of 3 or 4 days. I was at about 7.5 mg a day. I was able to go hours after waking up one morning without taking any and feel okay, I even felt that sober me clean feeling break through, but then I just took some anyway and now I‚Äôm back up again.

I feel like shit on them, but I can‚Äôt seem to muster up enough of myself to get back down. 
I don‚Äôt know why I did that I feel so stupid and stuck. I don‚Äôt know if I rushed myself to go too soon before I was ready, but I‚Äôm tired of feeling dead. I‚Äôm scared of withdrawals though. My dose isn‚Äôt very high but I‚Äôve been using daily for so long they always hit me hard. I get really bad RLS every time 

M partner doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm back up again. I don‚Äôt have it in me to tell him, he was so proud I got back down, and every relapse makes him so upset. I really want to be able to get myself back down and continue my taper without starting that upset. He wants me to open up every time I feel like I want to use, but I just hole up every SINGLE time. Does it get easier to talk about the more you do it?

I have an appointment with a psychologist next week and I‚Äôm hoping to get back on some meds to manage bipolar, I know a big part of me using is self medicating.

I‚Äôm sorry this post wound up so long, there‚Äôs been a lot stuck in my head, and I‚Äôm just sick and tired of feeling like shit. Thank you to anyone who read all of my ramblings",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9969940185546875}"

I was addicted to opiates for years...I have gone cold turkey off full agonists several times, but in 2018 decided to try Suboxone treatment.  3 years later, I was a new father and my marriage collapsed, lost several family members during COVID, lost a couple jobs, lost a couple pets...Somewhere down there I realized that the secret to a positive life experience must lie in the way I confront my own problems...There's nothing I can do to stop the onslaught of depressing shit that happens, so maybe if I am more prepared for it, I'll be happier...

&#x200B;

This January, I started tapering off Suboxone.  45 days ago, I finished my taper (jumped at 0.15mg).  I sparingly used the comfort meds they prescribed me to get off of Suboxone at the end of my taper and for the first 10-12 days after I jumped, but since I have been free from all prescription medication.  Jumping was freedom...The end of the taper was the worst part...All of it was less bad then I made it to be.

&#x200B;

If you're struggling to stay sober, congratulations...You want freedom, and you're going to get it if you refuse to give up for another day.  Eventually, it all gets better.  At 45 days, I am still dealing with relatively low energy, but it improves over time so I can feel myself returning to normal.  Most of the mental / PAWS stuff has been very minimal as I tapered to very low doses before I stopped...The key is not focusing on that, and instead focusing on all of the steps one can take to reduce stress and maximize potential in healthy ways...I turned to drugs because I wanted to cope with the situation I put myself in, but I didn't know how...I turned away from drugs when I realized the only way out was through...I am stronger today than I ever have been, and my son can look to his father as an example as he grows up.  Do it for you, but also do it because everyone around you will benefit from your sobriety in ways that you can't even imagine today.

Long story short, I suffer from a number of mental health issues including PTSD, Social Agoraphobia, Depression and Anxiety. Due to a number of factors, I‚Äôve been left to deal with my illness with very little assistance other than medication (which has had little to no effect).

Around 18 months-2 years ago, after suffering dental pain, I was prescribed a pain killer that included codeine. On taking them, I noticed that this helped me to sleep for a length of time the first time. My anxiety was far less severe and I was able to ‚Äòfunction‚Äô relatively normally.  I continued to use pain killers with codeine after my prescription ran out, buying them from local pharmacies. However what started as taking 8-16 a day eventually increased to 80-100 a day, in order for me to get the same effect as when I first stated taking them. My local pharmacies began to notice the frequency I was buying the tablets so refused to sell me them. I turned to buying them online but because many of the online pharmacies have practices to identify addicts again, this soon became unviable also. I am now having to buy them wherever possible, the dark web, other people etc.

Several months ago I approached my GP to enquire as to any assistance they could give me in helping me with my ‚Äòaddiction‚Äô,  but was told that I just have to stop (which I have tried a number of times but became extremely unwell and had to resort to taking them again). I have approached a number of different agencies but any request for assistance have been largely met with indifference or disregard, with it being my belief that as it is not a ‚Äòhard‚Äô drug that it is not taken seriously.

I am now at the point where I am in severe debt because of my addiction. It is also becoming almost impossible to get the medication so I may have no alternative but to move onto something else. I also underwent a blood test recently and was told that my blood was toxic yet still no offer of assistance has been forthcoming.

I want to be able to stop taking painkillers as if I accrue any more debt, I may find myself in an untenable situation. Any advice would be appreciated.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992368221282959}"

Day 365 (1 year later) I was snorting 30 fake M30's/day. This disease is fierce, cunning, progressive, and as addicts we find ways to rationalize the money, the use, the neglect of others in our life.

**WITHDRAWAL:** At 35, this was the first ""REAL"" WD I've ever faced. I tried stopping at 4 months and thought I had COVID. How naive I was...as one Redditor put it ""welcome to the bropriate game fam""! I wanted out immediately when I felt like I was dying (quite literally). But that FEAR...that voice that said ""you cannot"" that voice that said ""why go through that?"" that voice that said ""just a few more weeks""..keep me in addiction another 12 months where I don't think ANY single dose made me ""happy""...it made me feel ""normal"". But I had randomly caught an episode of intervention on TV and thought ""my God..that could be me"". We all have our own ""bottoms""...for me, I could vividly see losing everything I had as I spending about $5,000 a month on drugs for a year.

**BUT I PROMISED ADVICE...well, here it is:**

Number 1) **""It's bad..but not THAT bad""**. I have a beautiful paramedic ex gf who I contacted and told her what was going on. I thought she was going to say ""Oh my God....fent WD is going to be the hardest thing of your life"". She did NOT. I will quote her...""You FUCKING pussy! Yes, it will be a struggle, but you want to see pain? Watch someone on benzos having a seizure as they bite their tongue off...that's pain! Suck it up, stop using, and in 1 week it will be over. Watch some movies you weak bitch!"" She was not entirely wrong. I had bad cramps, I had some very negative thoughts, I had cravings, I could not sleep, I had gut wrenching anxiety...but I DID NOT feel suicidal, have a seizure, was not vomiting on the floor, diarrhea was non existent with the help of Imodium. So basically...it's a really bad flu...you WILL BE OK.

Number 2) **MUSIC** \- it saved me..not once, not twice, not three times, it saved me everyday. PM me for songs if you want, but I made 2 playlists. (1 that was hardcore hip hop to really say ""fuck you"" to fent and one that gave me the feels and reminded me this disease is not my fault, and I deserve happiness. Halsey's ""Gasoline"" for whatever reason...hit me harder than any other song at any other time of my life has hit me....not quite sure why...but just sharing. SO MAKE YOUR MIXTAPE(S) and PLAY THEM DAILY.

Number 3) **Comfort Meds.**  r/opiates has a sidebar with a WD guide...READ IT. It lists every comfort med. I used clonidine for anxiety, gabapentin for RLS, and xanax (not recommended) for sleep.

Number 4) This is a MUST...**BE KIND TO YOURSELF. BE PROUD OF YOURSELF**. You WILL feel guilt and shame...it will pass. Beating yourself up will lead to relapse. FORGIVE YOURSELF for the mistakes you've made. It's in the past. You can't change it, move on. You will want to self loathe...you will want to be mad at yourself...that is your disease telling you that you're not strong enough. I don't care what you did in addiction or the issues you caused, you need to let that shit go NOW AND FIGHT IT.  You can always make amends once your sober in a different place, but if you want to beat WD (the easy way) when your mind starts telling you how low your self esteem should feel...you NEED to think forward about who you can be, not backwards at who you were.  The point of recovery is to open a new chapter of your life and YOU WILL be a different person. One life can be made up of many different story lines and we do change as people, embrace the change.  So let it GO, NOW! WD is HARD, it's a BATTLE against yourself...YOU..CAN...WIN. But not if your general is berating the troops calling them all shitty people and putting them down. Put your arms around your soldiers (yourself in this analogy) and say....I'm sorry I haven't been the general you all needed, I'm sorry I let you down. But not today. TODAY...you get a pissed off general who is going to destroy the opponent. and when we go to war, there will be victory. So get your helmets on and strap up...it's a new day soldiers!!!

Number 5) **FEAR IS ONLY SCARY WHEN YOU REFUSE TO LOOK IT IN THE EYE**.  The basis of our identity during addiction is FEAR.  It convinced me, to my core, as real as something I could touch...that I was not strong enough to to this. I've heard it said ***""the best things in life are on the other side of fear""***.  When I finally decided to get what I needed to detox at home, against all the odds, against countless Redditors telling me ""I wouldn't be strong enough""..HERE..I...AM! This is not some ""home run victory lap"".  There is work to be done in my recovery, but we can ONLY take this one day at a time.  And you need to celebrate your wins and feel good about yourself.  Let me tell you as someone who had long term sobriety.  Time is not a tool to stay sober.  Somebody with 15 years of sobriety is no better or worse than someone with 10 days like myself. (they of course have more experience against this disease)  But the strength of your sobriety is based on the quality of life and happiness in my humble opinion.  But once my detox began...and it sucked, and I was in pain, and I wanted to use....I had moments where I said ""I honestly thought this would be harder.  I can't believe I was so afraid for so long.  This hurts, but I can survive this!""   BUT YOU HAVE TO FACE your addiction...but I promise you this..the SECOND you really do....you are stronger than you think...BELIEVE THAT!!!

Today is ONLY 10 days sober. My 10+ years of previous sobriety are gone (BUT NOT forgotten). I know what it takes to stay sober, and you HAVE to forgive yourself....so feel proud fo your journey...every...SINGLE...minute! For me, I'm emotional just thinking of how glad I am to where I am at Day 10 with pretty much all anxiety and physical WD gone. Some fatigue, but I am PROUD.

I need to know if anyone has ever had a situation similar to mine which in a nutshell goes like this:

I have gone to treatment for my heroin/ meth addiction 24 different times. 24 different locations, 24 different cash transactions adding up to almost 500,000.00. Ive gone to the nicest places, and ive gone to the county run facilities, but most of these places have one thing in common... they believe that it is necessary to suffer through your detox and recovery so that you some how appreciate when your clean and learn from your mistake? I have finished all but two of the programs i have gone through, with a month and a half being the longest ive ever been clean in 7 years. I refuse to spend another dime at a treatment facility. I just wont do it. I dont believe it works at all as i have tested it so many times. One time i quit at home and it was about as successful as the month and a half long rehab, and that was because i was so comfortable with the use of benzos and suboxone. I didnt have to suffer and still understood what was going on. The last time i tried quitting was a couple of years ago. I always felt like my last resort try would be going to hawaii and getting clean while staying at my grandmothers house. The thought being there isnt any heroin on the big island and ill be on an island so wont be able to go anywhere. It didnt go as planned as my crazy aunt decided to throw asway all of my suboxone and xanax in the middle of the night and instead wanted me to have the help of God. It was the worst experience ive ever had. I couldnt sleep for an entire month. I was still kicking my legs around and unable to stop moving the entire month. My grandma was trying to braid my hair one of the last nights i was there and she couldn't even get it done because i was rolling around on the ground the whole time, uncontrollably. When i got home from that, a few weeks later my best friend, and mother suddenly died. My entire world crashed down around me. So i started using again. I didnt want to sit at home though so i decided for the first time in my life to go get a job. I started working as a wardrobe consultant at a retail clothing company, a few months later as an assistant manager. My boyfriend also got a new job working construction with my father. Fast forward to now and he is a foreman at his company, and i am a store manager of my own store, just celebrated my 1st year. We do this by using a specific amount every day, we never go under and never go over. We go to bed at a certain time every night so were not up tweaking all night long. We show up every day and work our butts off to pay our rent and bills on time every month. But both of us know this can come crashing down at any second. Last year during our states lockdowns we found out i was pregnant. Being a mom is the only thing ive ever wanted in life, but i know what happens when girls have kids that are addicted to heroin and i didnt want to do that to another life so i got an abortion. I think about that every single day. I just want to have a family, and live this life ive worked so hard for normally. We have come so far from stealing from stores and returning our families purchases like 4 years ago, or being completely homeless and addicted to crack as i was like 6 years ago. I just need a way to get clean without having to sacrifice all of the accomplishments ive had in the last 2 years. I have an amazing family support system here, an amazing boyfriend, and some money saved up. I feel like right now is a perfect time to tell my work im going to be out for a few weeks since i can tell them i have covid. but im at a loss on how to go about this. if anyone has any ideas, or ways they have a similar story, or any comment at all please let me know. I dont want to die like this. I dont want this anymore, but i havent wanted this for the last 6 years. I am starting to lose hope.

The horrific stories of withdrawals get me through the long nights. I've had maybe 1 hour total sleep in 3 days. Coming off a 3 year heavy kratom addiction, with some binges on harder stuff sprinkled in.

The long and short of this post is what are the real dangers of drinking while in withdrawal. I mean like a 6-12 pack each day. I am also an alcoholic and planned to quit that at the same time as kratom, but I'm so unbelievably bored and uncomfortable I end up drinking every day.

I tapered down from like a 5th of vodka and a case of seltzer a day to maybe 10 or 11 beers. I've been exercising and trying to stay active during acutes, but the incredible boredom leads me to get more beer, at least then I feel better for a little bit.

 Cheers guys, gonna crack a cold one and enjoy some TV before another horrifying night of sleepless despair. Day 3 and going strong. I've quit kratom before, this is gonna be a shitty 2 week process at least.

I have been doing this for a over a quarter century and yet when I go to the r/methadone subreddit not only do I have to read some junior woodchuck tell even newer addicts desperate for an answer, that before they try ANY other available rehabilitation program, they should just jump straight to methadone, but THEN I also have to deal with reddit mods who support this horrible, deleterious advice. No professional would EVER agree with such advice, No one who cares about other addicts would give this advice, yet I cannot even challenge this ridiculous suggestion due to the collusion of the mods. As I still use a methadone clinic to this day, I obviously dont have any problem with it itself, you should just give some other much, much easier in the long-run, options a shot before you try methadone first go at kicking. To me, a mod who supports this, is like allowing lies about Ivermectin to fester or supporting Covid-truthers. Its wrong on the face of it. 

I'm not necessarily interested in printing individual usernames, they are bad, but its the information they spread that's so much worse and should be the focus. With that being said, has anyone else had a problem navigating methadone issues on this particular sub? Has anyone had any problems with the mods who supported dangerous advice by supporting the users who spread it? I only ask this sub r/OpiatesRecovery, for the shared interest and the possibility that many people may have come here after being disgusted by r/methadone. Again, I haven't said any names here and you shouldn't either, we can talk about that in private, but if you have had any problem with this sub, I'd be curious as to what they were? 

Thank-you, Good-luck in your recovery and remember how lucky you are to be going through this now and not 40 years ago when they just sent you to the prison farm at Lexington. Or to the Glass House in downtown Los Angeles where you kicked on a mat on the ground, a bucket, a bowl and doing it all on Front Street through 10ft high ground floor windows in full view of the entire city so as to be an example to anyone else who might try heroin. There are lots of things that can be tried in 2021, just try at least one before you jump straight onto methadone.",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986819624900818}"

So when I see post after post after post about PAWS I think ""oh noooooo, I'm gonna be in a world of psychological pain"" but then I vividly remember having an immediate pink cloud that lasted a LONG time.  (about 12 weeks).  NOW, my situation may be different.  My addiction is not out of trauma or having a bad family.  Quite the opposite, I am very blessed and EXTREMEMLY lucky to have a family who loves me...my use was just selfish in nature but I have no trauma, PTSD, or any other previous mental health...I was ""high on life"" before I got ""higher on fent"".  I will also note...I workout like a FUCKING machine....6 days a week I powerlift until I can't move...flooding my body with endorphins.

All that being said....is it 100% without a doubt...PAWS is mandatory for EVERYONE?  Or is there a chance I could get lucky again?

But this summer I took a long holiday and had paternal leave. So i soberd up and the Withdrawal was alright and managable But then when vacation was over and my job started again. I rapidly decended into addiction again. But everytime I detox and I say the magic words - never again. 

It starts good. But eventually I slip up. And the addiction just jumps into overdrive. And I do it harder than the last time. And this time got me worried(even thou i went through a pretty long buprenorphine addiction and Withdrawal more than once). 

But this addiction period with oxycodone has had me worried. Right now I only use Targiniq(20 mg oxy 10 mg naloxone pill). But the daily dose has the last week been around 140 mg a day. But I kind of don't feel it, there is no high, just a bit of a mood lift. The addiction period has just been around 5 weeks so its pretty short. But I have around 310 mg oxy left in the form of Targiniq pills with the naloxone. 

I have baclofen, gabapentin, memantine and loperamid and a few nitrazepam in my stash. I feel privledged to have this stash but at the same time I'm terrified because I never used this high a dose before.

Just need some comforting and any advice I can take. And yes Im already searching for a new job where I dont have to deal with narcotics as a rx nurse, This job will be my downfall otherwise.

But you know what, I didn't create myself so it's not my fault the universe made me that way, so what are you going to do right?


^^^^^


The facts: 2500 straight days of oxy use, no doctors to blame, I knew what I was getting myself in to. As many stories go, it took over my mind, and slowly turned me in to a fiend. I also use ADHD stimulants at low doses consistently, despite having been diagnosed with ADD years ago I haven't asked my new doctor for them because I already have a friend who gives me his leftovers. Over the last year I started getting really depressed and self conscious about losing weight, looking pale and unmotivated, so started to look for change, and I used Mushrooms and LSD to really drill hope in to my head that there was more out there for me, and it gave me a sneak peak of these emotions I had long forgotten. My only unique factor was (and this is not a boast) that I maintained a low tolerance for the last three years of between 30 and 35mg of oxy a day with no binging or any IV use etc. I ended up switching to 8mg dillies a couple months ago because I heard it was a quicker detox due to quicker half life, and I thought that gave me an opportunity to pull the trigger, due to my lack of mental endurance vs a long taper.

^^^^^

I read any addiction book I could get my hands on, watched every piece of content ranging from depression, to neuroscience, and everything about recovery from many high profile people with various viewpoints. I then read probably 1000 reddit posts, the horror stories, the miracles, the various strategies of getting clean, and then I went to a local clinic where they recommended I stabilize on suboxone despite my resistance, based on my low tolerance, figuring I would be upgrading my dependence rather than downgrading it which seemed to be the consensus on reddit. I also figured my depression may worsen as I had tried suboxone a couple weeks and just didn't feel great on it. 

^^^^^

So I finally made a plan, which was to attempt a 5 day taper using suboxone (bermese method?) where you can apparently still detox a short acting opiate while being shielded by the suboxone as long as you taper it down and don't stay on it long enough to become dependent on it with little to no WDs. I also called my doc and got every comfort med I could, clonodine, gabapentin, clonazepam, and then in my own personal stash I had a bit of everything for every scenario including Kratom. Plus most importantly, family and friends who had my back, and I do not take that for granted.

Here is what happened:

^^^^^

Day 1: I take my last 4mg of hydro and go to sleep the night before, I wake up and take the small half of a 2mg sub pill. Don't feel amazing, but it's mostly all in my head. I get a good sleep that night with minimal assistance from ambien and weed. 

^^^^^

Day 2: I take 0.5mg of sub, the day and night goes about the same, except I do feel a bit more of the cold sweats and goosebumps but kind of underneath the little shield of suboxone if that makes any sense, like feeling the cold seep through your winter jacket.

^^^^^

Day 3: I take 0.25mg of sub, and repeat everything above, feeling pretty lame but still functional. Trying not to use more than 4g kratom a day, but either way it doesn't seem to do much for me. At this point i'm also using Gabapentin, but not noticing any beneficial effects besides my body feeling drunk and loss of balance due to the lower blood pressure I presume

^^^^^

Day 4: I take what was to be my last crumb of sub. At this point I assume the hydromorphone is already out of my system because of the short half life, I laid in the sun and it felt nice, and that night I hang out with my best friend and we are both really stoked that things are going well so far, though I am still nervous and it was harder to get to sleep that night so I used some comfort meds.

^^^^^

Day 5: I wake up feeling pretty refreshed, I have a nice shower and notice an increased awareness, is this the infamous fog lifting a bit? Surely I can't already be past the worst of it! I guess all those reddit posts and videos I watched were actually true, and it makes sense because these are guys getting off IV Fent comfortably so my situation should be a slice of cake by comparison. Phew. I notice I am out of the 3 clonodine I previously had lying around so I called my doctor to see if I could get a few more and he said it was fine.

^^^^^

Day 5.5 : I am not feeling great, as expected, not physically but mentally I suddenly don't have that excitement that i've actually committed to this and following through. I start getting tired so I have an hour long nap in the afternoon and when my alarm goes off I wake up sweaty (I never sweat except in extreme heatwave scenarios) in a kind of a panicked and confused state. It's now dark out and my sense of time is off where I feel like it should still be light out and this somehow starts me on this spiral downward in terms of mood. I sit down and start watching a documentary or something, and take half a clonazepam along with a couple grams of kratom to get me back on track, but within the hour it's as if it's had the opposite effect. So I take gabapentin, eat some fruit and vitamins and try to shake it off, but things are just getting worse by the minute at this point and I text my friend who was due to come over and hang out to cancel. 

^^^^^

Day 5.75 - From about 11pm to 3am is probably the darkest hours of my life, I take more kratom and it does nothing, I am not having much physical discomfort but my brain is simply incapable of processing one positive thought, you could hand me a winning ticket for a billion dollars and I would not be able to smile. It's not a panic attack, I am very familiar with those, but it's just an overwhelming sense of eternal doom and I want the night to end now so I start trying to knock myself out with a xanax, an ambien, ketamine and weed, and more kratom, and even with all of them the only moments of relief are when i'm too confused and forget what i'm doing. I end up pacing around looking for the remote, or chocolate or whatever I was aimlessly doing and I am the most sedated I have ever been literally falling down and knocking shit over, I decide it's time for bet and I skip brushing my teeth because i'd probably end up hurting myself. I finally get in to bed and my best friend is texting me the most supportive messages i've ever gotten from anyone, I have tears streaming down my face, but I still can't feel the love and literally tried to type something out explaining how much I appreciate the support, but it's surreal because I can't feel the support, I can only objectively see the love as data that I can't convert to positive feelings yet. Somehow I pass out, and sleep a full eight hours.

^^^^^

Today: I come to and try to make sense of it all, and pray to god that yesterday was the peak and if I can just get through the day, even if it's almost as bad, I might be out of the black hole. But my friends come by and check on me and once again, even after taking kratom first thing and clonidine plus vitamin C, I look at them and the cake they brought me and I am unable to feel one atom of joy. I feel so terrible watching them chat with my brother and keep an eye on me as I slump in my recliner not even able to fake the appearance of being OK which really sucked for them because I love them so much and want nothing more than to express that. And that was my breaking point, about to burst in to tears in front of everybody I got up, walked to my room and put a crumb of what was probably 0.2mg sub under my tongue and sat back down. Within 20 minutes, I felt like I had just risen from the dead, I was phoning my mom, up walking around, making plans for the evening, and fucking defeated. 

^^^^^

This was such a long time coming, I always told everyone I would not state I was quitting until I knew that I was truly doing it for myself, and that I truly no longer was in love with my drug of choice, I had not directly hurt anyone around me or resorted to stealing etc and felt I was going to hit a point soon where that could happen and wanted to escape before I burned those bridges. I defied the doctors that told me I should be transitioning on to suboxone because everyone on reddit told me the amount I was using was not worth it, and easily kickable cold turkey, plus they want to push someone like me on to a dose that would drastically raise my tolerance overall and I saw that as tightening my handcuffs. 

^^^^^

How did I fuck this up so badly and where do I go from here? If I can't get through two fucking days of that after months of research and preparedness, every comfort med, 24/7 support in a warm comfortable house with people that love me having my back, with enough benzos to become fully addicted to them in a week and start a devastating benzo habit (walking in with one addiction and leaving with two). What am I supposed to do now? It's humiliating and demoralizing reading stories about people overcoming much more dangerous drugs at much higher dosages with no support and I can not fathom how they did it, while I bitched out (unless I can somehow not go back to square one and salvage my progress). Do you guys think I just fucked up my timeline and tapered too quick? Or is my brain so fried from the sheer length of time I was using for that it's incapable of getting through this without serious medical intervention? Is just going on to suboxone or back to pills my only route forward at the moment while I work on and strenghten myself to tackle this again?",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983622431755066}"

Any advice on how to sleep and most importantly‚Ä¶how long until the heart rate went down.  My body is feeling better, but my heart is making me nervous. (80bpm) I normally work out 6 days a week and it‚Äôs about 63bpm.  My blood pressure must be high too but I don‚Äôt have a checker.

Hope yall are doing well. And for those suffering, either in active addiction still, or in the throes of withdrawal, my heart goes out to you. 

So this isn't my first rodeo, but I've been beaten up so much this last time. I can't continue on with this life. Lying to those around me. Breaking my family's heart. Jails and detoxes. Misery. I've decided to take the plunge. For the last time. 

Currently I'm in something of a halfway house, and I've been able to fool them with dumping other people's urine in the piss test cups. So I don't really have the option of coming clean, getting sent back to jail possibly, or detox, and lose my spot in this program. 

Long story short, I just did my last few bags. Tomorrow I take the plunge. I have a couple gabapentins to tide me over until I can take subs, then do a quick taper. I'm just really worried about getting to that point where I CAN actually take a sub without going Into PWD. Especially nowadays, this northeast US dope is all fent now, and ya gotta wait DAYS before you can sub up. 

I'm gonna use my gabs sparingly, as I don't have many. I'm gonna use the COWS scale as an indicator for when sub induction should be OK, cuz God knows solid time frames don't mean shit anymore. They vary from person to person and also vary based on type of fent analogue. 

I'm really fucking scared, but I know I have to do this. I'm only 21, and I know I can accomplish alot in life, if I could just get this monkey off my back. 

I plan to post every single step of my detox here, checking in at least 4x a day, and will also be posting about my Post Acute WDs as well. I know it sounds dumb, but I feel like if I post about it, I have you guys rooting me on. Like I have some accountability with you guys. And I don't wanna let you down, or myself. Whatever it takes. 

It's almost 12 midnight on the east coast of the US now. I just did my last bags. I shouldn't be SICK sick when I wake up, but I'll feel slightly lethargic. By my history, I'm estimating that I'll start feeling shitty by like 5 pm, and sick sick by midnight, or 6 the next morning. 

So again, I will be checking in. Often. Please pray for me! Lend me your energy! I got this!!!!

I've spoken with the moderators about my intentions and they have graciously allowed me to post the following:

My name is Joey and I am the brother of two recovering opiate users. I am working on a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing better services for those recovering from substance use in the modern day.

Consequently, I am about to pitch the organization's services to a panel for funding and need more data. Thus, I've created a short survey as linked below. This survey is anonymous and purely aimed at providing better solutions for those dealing with substance use disorders.

I can offer to pay $5 per survey submission for the first 50 submissions. I will pay out via venmo or paypal per your preference as submitted at the end of survey.

NOTES:

1. Only one submission per person
2. Please take your time and be as honest as possible.
3. This project comes from my heart and is the culmination of years of hardship and desperation. This is not a cash grab. We will use this data to help determine whether or not we deserve the funds of this panel to start the research and development for a product that might very well help save lives.

Thank you so much for hearing me out.

Thank you so much,

Joey

**EDIT:**  The product/service we are testing for is NOT a drug or supplement. Rather it is a subscription based support box or care package if you will. I realize the vague wording in the survey conveyed it as a supplement or pill of some kind. This is NOT the case! It is a combination of both utilitarian and novel items meant to help aid in the recovery process. This can range from something as simple as a field guide to recovery to vitamin packs to literally coffee or a nicely rolled mugwort joint. Regardless, it is not a medication of any literal form. Sorry for miscomunication!

I have adjusted the wording to better reflect this.

Thank you to everyone who already submitted. If you would like to resubmit based on new wording, feel free to do so but keep in mind we can only pay once.

Started 7 years ago, had a couple of cocodamol for a dental abscess and that was the start of it, how could something so small control my life for the next 7 years?

A couple of years ago you could buy dihydrocodeine online so easy. Shit was expensive but who cares when your addicted to that shit? Once that stopped what was I to do? That's when I found neurofen plus. 12.8mg of codeine per tablet. Munch a few of them and it soon adds up. Then that doesn't work and we all know how it spirals from there. I dread to think how much I've spent and how close I've probably come to seriously fucking up my body. I probably have done some damage but we shall see. 

Here I am, fed up of hiding my problems, fed up of lying. My GF found out about my habit, I said I stopped but I didn't. She found out again and I said I had cut down but I hadn't. I'm sick of being a prick, she deserves better.

The crazy thing is I work in social care, I help to get addicts in recovery. I put them in touch with community drug and alcohol services whilst they're an inpatient in hospital yet I can't seem to kick my habit. They tell me about how hard it is and I'm dying to say I know how you feel. But I can't.

Today is day 3, I feel like shit, work has been shit the past few days. I can't sit still, my legs ache however buscopan is helping with some of the GI issues. I went cold turkey because I know I can't do it any other way.

Tomorrow is another day and the day after is the weekend. Finally some time to chill at home where my anxiety can cool down. As much as I want some coffee to wake me up during the day it would just send my anxiety through the roof so I'm keeping away.

I know it's ""only"" codeine but it's still shit. Thanks for attending my Ted talk.

About 4 months ago I noticed the left side of my tongue beginning to get sore way in the back of my throat, as well as a soar and very dry throat. I have been biting my tongue in my sleep for many years (before the Vicodin and Xanax), so I figured that was what the problem was.

A random question I know. I have taken high doses of codeine and dihydrocodeine time after time over the last 3 or 4 years, usually a month or two on, followed by a week or two cold turkey withdrawal, followed by however long I then managed to stay clean. It‚Äôs normally around a month. Then the cycle repeats.

Each time the cold turkey comes around though I forget how it went the last time. I always think I should keep a diary but then don‚Äôt ever intend there being a next time so I simply don‚Äôt.

This list time though I was clean for over 160 days, just short of 6 months and that was a massive thing for me. My first target was always the 100 day mark to begin with but I never thought I‚Äôd hit that.

I relapsed about three or four weeks ago and I‚Äôve been taking 2 DHC doses a day. Normally mid day around 150mg and evening around 250mg.

The original question‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sure if I remember rightly in the past after 24 hours I get the need to use Imodium and then the restless legs start that night. No motivation or appetite. This time though, 48 hours in and other than the heat keeping me awake last night and taking a small dose (50mg) of lyrica, I‚Äôve had only psychological symptoms. I‚Äôve felt sad and upset, like I‚Äôve let myself and my family and girlfriend down. Thinking of the number of days clean I would have been on now. Is it normal four people to experience little to no withdrawal symptoms cold turkey on some occasions? I‚Äôve heard that people can ‚Äúget away with it‚Äù sometimes, but I never have. I do recall in the past, years before it became a big thing I would spend a few days on codeine and not having symptoms or issues stopping, but about 3 or 4 years ago after my first real heavy spell on them I have had bad withdrawals ever since.

Can I expect them to kick in delayed?
Is it because it was nearly a 6 month break and I‚Äôm more like a first time user rather than only having a few weeks clean?

I‚Äôm not knocking it so far, but dreading the nasty surprise a few days later.

I have 160 days sober today. Things have been going very well and I have been progressing through IOP (Intensive Outpatient) Treatment. I started in detox for 2 weeks, did a 60-day residential rehab, and transitioned to the Sober Living/IOP program owned by the same company that did my residential treatment.

My DOC was opiates in pill form for the last 16 years. I have excelled in IOP and have gained a lot of trust with clinical staff who are not on the sober living site. Everything from a clinical standpoint is done through Zoom from their office about 2 miles down the street. I help them often because I live at the site and have been privileged to help a lot of the new residents here get plugged into their IOP program and am also Steering for the location.

I get called often to assist with various things around the facility because of the trust I have built with staff, and the progress I have made in the program with my peers.

So I am very happy with my life right now but today I got a phone call from my therapist who basically runs everything and is also my One on One therapist. She tells me that I tested positive for THC last week but the level is low. She explained that the entire clinical staff was stunned when the results came back and I am the last person they would think would pop on a test. I don't think I have to explain this being that we're all anonymous and there is nothing to be gained from lying to all of you on a website about this, but I don't use drugs anymore and the last time I was around THC in any form was last Christmas about 9 months ago.

So I am floored as to how this could possibly happen. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I share a room with another guy and at times things have been a little awkward between us for various reasons. He has had two random UA's because staff suspected him of using them. I have to report if I suspect anyone using that is in our program or be booted myself if they think I know something and don't report it. So on both occasions, I was asked for my opinion and both times I told them I thought he was using as well.¬†

¬†Based on remarks he has made since then, I'm pretty sure that he knows or thinks I said something too clinical about him. Sorry for such a long post, I just wanted to paint a picture and give y‚Äôall as many details as possible. I guess what I am asking here is, being that this guy lives with me, do you think it‚Äôs possible that he could have spiked my drink with THC or something to cause me to pop on a test, or am I being paranoid??

I got pregnant while on it and couldn't get off of it and now my son is almost 2 and I'm just ready to be done. I was at 75mg the entire time and have been tapering down for the last 9 months. I'm down to 24 mg and will be down to 22 on Friday.  I'm tapering by 2mg now every 2 weeks because that's as often as I go to the clinic. My question is - I'm not sure at what point I just stop going to the clinic. If you've been on methadone you know there ain't much in the bottle once you get down under 20 mgs. I was thinking to get down as far as 10mg but it's going to become pointless to go at a certain point. Has anyone else gone through this? I have a professional job I can't miss work and they don't know I'm on methadone to begin with. Guess we will call that my dirty little secret. I'd like to get off of it as seamless and quietly as possible.  I do have a therapist I just started seeing so I have some support. My husband is on suboxone and not ready to get off of it but he is supportive. I know I could always get a teensy piece of his to get off of it if the pain got bad but that's a slippery slope.

&#x200B;

Rains flood the sewers and city roads and glimmer like sapphires against the street lights that cast a thousand shadows along the passing cars and buses. Tents and blue tarps that house the dispossessed stretch along the walkways further north past the Toy District, where I need to be. Right now, I‚Äôm standing outside the iron gates of The Bin on 5th and Towne waiting for Gina to grab her clothes and bag before we meet Arcade who‚Äôs holding the gear we‚Äôve sourced. Fentanyl‚Äôs flooded the streets and filled the county morgue with nameless bodies. 

A week before Thanksgiving I watched a friend start convulsing on the concrete entrance outside of the Renato. I called 911 and performed CPR, wiping the fresh ribbons of blood that poured from his nose between each breath. Weeks later the toxicology report was released. ‚ÄúCombined toxic effects of alprazolam, hydrocodone, and fentanyl. Manner of Death: Accidental.‚Äù Sourcing the right junk all the time was impossible, but you could lower your chances.

Gina walks out and covers her head with a rain jacket she picked off a John years back. 

*I‚Äôm starting to shake.* She pulls a pack of Marlboro 100 lights and motions for me to cover her with my coat as she lights two, handing me one. I inhale deep and hold the smoke in my lungs then breath out and watch it mix with the steam and exhaust that hangs in the air. 

*I‚Äôm not walking in this.* 

*The fuck you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs ten minutes and we need 2 liters of Sprite, Arc said he has Tuss.* 

I look up.

*Think he‚Äôs in a mood. Like a good one for a fuckin‚Äô change.*

Gina finishes her cigarette and drops it in a pool of rainbow slick waste water that gathers by the storm drain. She moves before the light turns and I follow her, watching her boots leave prints on the road as we head North towards salvation. 

Gina turns tricks for food. She‚Äôs been working the blade for seven years and can run a date before the hour‚Äôs done. I‚Äôve known her two years now, coming on three. The first time we met I had collapsed after my first overdose and face planted on Tito Puente‚Äôs Hollywood Star outside the Dolby Theatre. She was digging through the trash when it happened and called 911. A week later I found her again and she gave me the dope that kept the sickness away. 

At twenty-five, she‚Äôs resilient. Dark hair cut short to her shoulders, down to tan tattooed arms that bore track marks and blade scars. Some self inflicted, others a part of a history I would never know. *These? Love letters from another life*, she‚Äôd say. The topic would change and we‚Äôd talk about anything else. But I‚Äôve heard whispers. Of how when she first arrived a John took her to a motel in Desert Hot Springs and kept her there for three days. When she came back, they said she didn‚Äôt speak for a month. In the sun you could still make out the ligature marks that snaked around her wrists and throat.

*Hold this.*

We‚Äôre here, at the People‚Äôs Market on 5th and San Pedro. Gina slips inside as I hold her bag and wait under the overhang as the torrents that started the day before continue on endlessly with reports that the rest of the week would persist with heavy, unabating showers. I wonder what this city would look like under water. The summer sun barely breaking the surface of the icy whiteheads that crashed on to other shores. A city lost to the depths. Well, I think, I wouldn‚Äôt have Gina.

She taps my shoulder and holds up two bottles of Sprite Tropical. *Arc texted. He has Christmas presents.* I smile and take the bottles and continue on behind her. Nameless nobodies trailing boot marks against the  soaking concrete that fade in seconds, leaving no trace that we were ever even there. 

*Loman said the top floor‚Äôs open. They‚Äôre doing construction or some shit on some of the rooms but only during the day and the penthouse is unlocked.* We squat under the awning of the Primo Wholesale smoking the last of Gina‚Äôs Marlboro‚Äôs as Arcade grips the fading Jansport against his chest with his left arm. *He hooked us up. These key cards get us up. All the way up,* he said. 

Arcade had lost his right arm to infection after a habit of reusing one hitters he shared with his wife who now lay buried somewhere outside the city limits. Years prior, he had lost his home and his daughter to Hurricane Katrina while he was deployed, scouring the scorched plains of Afghanistan for other men who knew the land and hid in its shadows.

*I got all the gear right here but we need to get inside quick. I seen Jump Out Boys hawking the parks.* Gina and I look at each other and just as soon, we‚Äôre gone. Arcade leads the way as we pick up from behind, cold spiking our hands and legs and ribs. Above, thunderheads gather and watch over us like Holy Spirits. We‚Äôre flocking towards the glistening towers of downtown.

From this height the world around us is a drowning pool of colored light and amber glow that bleeds up past the mountain peaks towards the ocean dark center of the sky. It‚Äôs warm here, the sounds of the feral city don‚Äôt make it past the 12th floor and all those ghosts that follow you leave at the door. This, I think, is what money buys. Stillness. 

*Arcade isn‚Äôt bummed is he? I was stupid.* Gina pushes the words out of her mouth like honey. I watch her in the low light of the work lamps that spot this place like cave torches, shooting angled shadows against the tarps and dry wall.

We‚Äôve been slumped now for four hours and the mood has shifted. Arcade blames Gina for bringing in what he calls ‚ÄòThe Fog‚Äô. This insidious, all encompassing fever that we were constantly on the run from, never stopping and never resting. It It had caught Arcade‚Äôs wife, Gina‚Äôs sister. Everyone we‚Äôd see one day and not the next. The Fog wasn‚Äôt sadness or fear or abhorrence. It was nothing. A void in thought and feeling that found its way into your veins in the aftermath of persistent, unwavering isolation. 

What she had said was to invite friends. Getting loaded on the top floor of the Ritz was a group activity, but after searching through our phones for 40 minutes in silence, we realized that no one was left. We were the only friends we had. I try and assure Gina who nods awake, her pupils pin point and giving way to the raw umber that shone like hot glass in the sun.

*If we actually lived here. Shit, can you imagine?* Gina poses on the floor and I laugh. *Imagine all the dope we could buy.* Arcade sounds off. *Or we could pay someone to be our friend.* Gina‚Äôs voice is low as she gets up and stretches her arms above her head and along the backside of her ribs are clear marks I hadn‚Äôt seen before. I‚Äôd ask, but I know better. *Wouldn‚Äôt that be something? Paying someone to be there for you.* *Isn‚Äôt that what you get paid to do?* Arcade walks over.

*Nobody would pay to spend time with me. They pay to screw me the way can‚Äôt with their wives. But a friend? They couldn‚Äôt betray you or steal from you or fuck you over. I mean yeah, you‚Äôd have to pay them, but you‚Äôd have a friend for life. Wouldn‚Äôt that be something*

Gina looks over at me and smiles and I wonder for a moment who she would have been in another life. A smiling woman on some distant planet, enjoying the warmth of other suns. Outside the rains cease and for a moment the world is quiet and still. I think about telling her about the man I met in an airport in Phoenix years ago. I stand next to her as she lays her head against my shoulder. I think better of it and say nothing at all as I feel her heart beat slow like a muffled drum. 

Six months later my cousin brought me to my parents house, staging an intervention and three months after that I got a call from Gina telling me Arcade had left for Detroit.

*I‚Äôm proud of you. You have people who want to see you clean. I want to see you clean. You‚Äôre all I have left.* Gina said, her voice low. 

Two months later I got the call. She‚Äôd been found face down in an apartment. She was alone. Toxicology showed combined effects of fentanyl and diazepam. The manner was accidental. Sometimes I conjure her in my dreams, her voice and dry humor still intact. Except she‚Äôs with people. Surrounded by friends who care about her, who could do more than I ever could. I see her, the room a bit more crowded than that night at the Ritz. Sometimes we talk, other times she barely notices me. But she‚Äôs there, talking to her friends, making connections. And above all.

Was there for 9 + years and near the end (the last 3 years or so) I had build up enough take-homes where I only had to go to the clinic twice a month at most. 

After having to move back home, in a rural area where methadone treatment is looked down upon and not offered **at all** (our local pharmacies don't even stock *subutex* for fucks sake, that's how bad the **NIMBY**ism is here where I live now. 

Does anyone know a way to get on methadone maintenance when the nearest clinic is a 350-mile round trip?

I couldn't go to a clinic every day again to build up take-home doses as I have a job.

I was hoping someone here knew of a different treatment finder than the ones I've been searching that may be able to point me in the right direction. A hidden *diamond in the rough of a clinic* so to speak? One I haven't been able to find through the normal searches (SAMHSA, Etc.)

Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer. Feel free to message me. 

I really appreciate it. 

I can no longer abide buprenorphine treatment for $600/month.

It dulls my senses, steals my personality and makes me feel terrible. 

The only time it feels like it's working anymore (remember I've been *stable* on bupe for 6 + years now) is when I don't take any bupe for a couple days and start to feel shitty.

Then I can put a piece under my tongue and feel just the *slightest* bit of relief and have a half-normal day.

Otherwise, throughout the month, my doses make me feel **terrible** and frustrated. 

It's like the partial agonist activity almost makes my brain incapable of feeling even natural endorphins. 

I don't want to relapse back to street opioids. I can't do that. 

I've taken runs and exercised more, tried anti depressants, you name it. 

**I've come to the conclusion that in order to keep myself on track (hold down my job and stay clean from street drugs) I have to get back on methadone.**

If anyone knows a way to get the treatment I need from a sympathetic doctor - whom I could provide my history of 9 + years in a clinic (at 187 mg/day) followed by 6 + years in bupe treatment, and even provide proof of years of clean urine screens. . . 

Or am I just screwed unless I can move back to the city or get a clinic in my hometown?

2021-09-07 18:07:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/pjx2te/will_i_experience_any_significant_withdrawal/,Will I experience any significant withdrawal symptom stopping suboxone after 1 week of use?,"Hi guys and gals,
I've been on a H run for the past month. Hasn't been daily use up until abut 5-7 days ago (not that every other day or every 2 days is much better). Now I am using daily. I'm so stupid to think a month ago that I could casually use H. It always leads to the position I am in now - ALWAYS. So here I am trying to stop again. 

I have a 7 day subscription for suboxone. I can easily get more from my doctor but I really don't want to become dependent on Suboxone and have to withdrawal from that as well. I hear sub withdrawal is just as bad or worse than opiates.

So to get some distance between me and H, I am considering taking subs for 7 days. Should I experience serious withdrawal symptoms? I am prescribed 2, 2mg tabs per day, however I find taking just one pill works just fine. Is it going to be similar withdrawal symptoms if I were to take subs for 3 months? If I am going to go thru the pain of withdrawal I may as well get some more clean time under my belt. But if I can drastically reduce WD symptoms by taking for just one week, I want to do that.

Now after I come off the Subs am I going to have to answer for the H withdrawal too? I know the mental part lasts a long time but as far as the physical H withdrawal, should that be gone for the most part? Sorry if that doesn't make sense.

**----Rant...you can skip this part----**

I really want to stay off this stuff for good. I walk around a store and envy regular people so much. Life is mundane and boring but that is what I want. I just want to feel good. or at least satisfactory. 

For me, the physical part of the withdrawal is the easy part (although not easy at all). The hardest part is the mental anguish that follows - Depression, lack of energy, lack of motivation. All of that is what leads me back to the drug and I imagine is the reason for most people. I am just so sick of doing this. I have a good life, with people that care about me. That is all going to soon be thrown away if this continues. I need this to stop. I am motivated more than ever. I just need to get some distance between me and the drug. 

I know rehab is probably the best solution, but I am really trying to avoid that. I own a business that can't run without me and I have people that count on me and correspond with me on a daily basis for work. It would be extremely disruptive to leave for 30 days. I could potentially end up losing everything. Not to mention having to come up with an excuse for why I am gone for so long. So I am really trying to avoid that.

**----Rant over----**

I really appreciate everyone on this sub. It is very helpful for people getting off and staying off drugs. Thanks for all you do. I appreciate any help you guys can provide regarding subs. Thank in advance!",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987404942512512}"

I got clean from Methadone exactly 4 months ago after having a few seizures and being hospitalized. The first month was pretty bad, but things got a little better after that. Leg pains are gone, I get better sleep, my skin doesn't itch as much, my memory has come back, and I can think as fast and as clear as before I started doing drugs. I've done lots of research into recovery, and the Acute/Post-Acute symptoms of opiate use so I'm familiar with how my emotions and thoughts might be affected by the sudden change in lifestyle.

I have pretty much everything that would make a regular person fulfilled: a good career, an intimate relationship, a few close friends, hobbies, responsibilities, commitments, etc.

Here's what I don't get though.

I can't shake this constant thought that I'm a husk of who I was months ago. My friends, family, and girlfriend have all mentioned improvements they've seen in my life, and they all seem so satisfied and relieved. I, however, feel like I've got one foot in the grave. I crave the excitement of all the things I used to do, the adrenaline rush of being a """"""criminal"""""", the anticipation and release of getting drugs. I have to actively resist the perspective that the current life I'm living will leave me filled with regret and longing for the highs and lows that I had before.

In the past, I was sober for 18 months (give or take) after quitting cold-turkey. The same feelings and thoughts I'm having now drove me back to drugs then, and I'm concerned that the ultimate conclusion of this twisted turmoil in my head will drive me to drugs again. I understand the inherent bias that memory has, especially with drugs; remembering only the good feelings and not the bad. I understand that I only see the times when I was high and nodding out and snoring in movie theatres. Even when I fill my head with thoughts of withdrawal, pain, and suffering to curb my desire to go back, I still can't convince myself that I what I'm doing, what I'm forcing myself to do, is succumbing to a life that everyone else thinks I should have.

The Question(s):

Am I seeing a true perspective on my desires in life, or is this just a warped idealization of a horrible death-sentence, driven by prolonged drug use? Why shouldn't I go back to Methadone, long-nights, and partying like irresponsible college kids? I was able to work full time, spend quality time with friends, have fun doing my hobbies, etc. My bills were paid and I felt fulfilled with the life I had.

Maybe I'm just romanticizing it all. I am really not trying to glorify drug-use, or trigger anyone to relapse. I apologize for the length of the this. If I had more time, I would have written a shorter post.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9763185381889343}"

64 days ago I walked out of my dead end job that was beyond stressful. Completely defeated. So unhappy with my addictions and where I was at in life. 
I did it for myself this time. That's the big difference this time around. Not to make my family shut up, not to make a half assed attempt to dry out. It was to actually heal and accomplish a sense of balance in life. 
Because of this new found confidence I tried and tried to find a new career path. 
I start a new job next week making almost double what I was making before and am so grateful that this company took a chance on me with my record and the fact I am still on maintenance medication. 
I am going to meetings, I exercise, I shower everyday, I pay my bills on time. It may seem like small things but these small things snowball and gain momentum. 
My family wants me around. People in my life are the biggest difference. No more hiding, no more feeling shame. No more watching over my shoulder for police, getting robbed, overdosing. It is a freedom I never thought I would feel. 
The road to get here has been tough as hell. 
But I finally feel like my life is worth fighting for. 
Which is a change from just hoping to not wake up and drift away from all life and its problems. 
I know it's still wayyyy early in my recovery but I am watching every step I take to make sure my willingness to stay sober keeps burning hot.

I started taking these tablets many years ago, at around 23, and today is my 32nd birthday. I started off taking the recommended dose, then realised how great they felt and soon enough even a pack of 32 didn't touch the sides. 
The last year of my life has been horrific. Through taking so many tablets ( sometimes up to 84 a day ) I ended up losing my albumin levels to the point of near death, and a potassium so low the doctor was surprised I was able to stand. These occurred because I was constantly throwing up, inflamed my stomach and severely damaged my pancreas. 
With my albumin levels so low, it started to seep out into my cells there for causing me to swell. Earlier this year I was 10 stone, and within 2 months I was at 18. It was pure water retention. 
Endoscopy, colonoscopy, CT scans, abdominal drainage followed and my doctor told me if I didn't stop taking Ibruprofen I would die. 

That was four months ago. I'm down to 12 stone now, my sickness has stopped. My swelling has reduced and I feel like I'm really getting my life back. It was so difficult stopping them cold turkey, I didn't think I would get through the horrific pain and crippling depression, but I had no choice. I haven't had any cravings so far, and have even managed to stop smoking. 

I just want people to know, just because it's served over the counter it doesn't make it any less dangerous.

I wake up every single morning with crippling anxiety, terrified of life and how to get through the day, with extremely tight stomach, so much that I'm shivering in the bed with a blanket, although it's still somewhat warm here and have trouble waking up to do things, can't do anything though. Then, taking Xanax and anxiety won't be bearable until I take Kratom. Imagine the anxiety levels not be able to calm down EVEN after taking Xanax. I can't even sleep. I need to add some Remeron too to be able to sleep.

I can't remember when it gets better, it must be I think day 10th or something. It feels like it lasts forever. But that waking up in the morning, it is the worst feeling I've felt in my life. So much anxiety that almost need to puke.

The last time I withdrawn from O-DSMT was definitely easier, Tramadol is evil. I've read stories from people feeling withdrawals just even from 3 days of use in high doses. Wish me luck.

Tramadol is like alcohol, you pay the price immediately even for 1 use the next day. This is what it does for me at least.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976286292076111}"

The last 3 months have been the worst of my 33 years on this earth. 3 weeks ago I was laid off from my job with no money to pay my rent, phone bill, no food in my fridge, no gas in my truck, no cigarettes, no tv, no playstation, no nothing. I was at the end of my rope. I didn't know what to do, so I called my mom.... All she had for advice for me was suck it up buttercup. I told her I've been trying to ""suck it up"" for the past month and a half as I was in an outpatient treatment program that obviously wasn't work as I was still using. Hell as soon as I left the treatment program for the day I'd go straight to my guys house to pick up. I had no hope left and was inches away from suicide.

But then I got a phone call from my dad called me and told me he was on his way. My dad saved my life 3 weeks ago. He got to town sat me down and said to me. ""You got 2 choices, life or death. And I know which one is choose for you, but you have to make that choice"" I was frozen in time, all thoughts coming to me at once and my anxiety was skyrocketing quicker the Jeff bezos. I couldn't think straight I couldn't see straight, I couldn't even talk straight. I told him all of that and he said that's okay, I'm here with you. 

The next day I went to my case manager and said some of the hardest things I've ever had to say about myself in my life. That I need inpatient treatment. He got on the phone right away and set up and appointment with another treatment facility, got my assessment the next day, and by Friday I was in the inpatient treatment facility. That whole week was the scariest week of my life. Fearing the unknown, not knowing what was going to happen, and all I could think of was just one more time, just to say goodbye, to have alittle send off party before I put it to rest for good. Luckily that didn't happen. Within that week I packed up my apartment told landlord I was moving out, and found a cat sitter for the unforseeable future, told my friends, that as much as I love them, I probably won't be around for awhile if ever again.

Well here I am 9 days in inpatient treatment (they let us have our phone on Sundays for a couple hours as visitors aren't allowed due to covid) 19 days clean and the healthiest I've ever been physically and mentally. Gained 10 pounds in a week, started reading and writing , meditating daily basis, but most importantly being completely honest with myself and others. It's a great facility and a I got a great group. I'm on the proper meds to help with anxiety and depression. I'm going to the bathroom regularly now, and each night my sleep gets alittle better. I know I've only just begun on this journey to recovery, but I now have hope that it's possible for me to have a happy healthy life.

If your feeling stuck and see no way out, just know there is a way out. There are people out there that care, people out there who want to help. The trick is you have to ask for it. Go to a meeting, call a treatment center, hell call a trusted friend or family member. Just do the next right thing.

Thank you for reading, and hope this helps at least one person out there

Damn I slept in 1.5 hours and am still early enough to make the check in? How?! Lol. Im off work today but am gonna devote at least an hour to lining up some social media posts/stories for the week. We got a bunch of dope events coming up, and apparently the first event I was in charge of promoting was so well attended we sold out of most of our event specific inventory within the first hour (!!) Despite it being on a weds afternoon, so hopefully I can continue having those kind of results!  

Last night was pretty busy but not to an overwhelming point, which I was happy about cuz I need the $ to continue to save for moving, and it being busy makes time go by so much quicker. Only one of my coworkers who's my good homegirl knows I'm moving, and how I ended up telling her is a long story, but there's a good chance she might be able to move into my apt directly after I move out which would work perfectly! And in a weird way it'll be cool knowing one of my friends lives here now, in the place I've spent the longest time at other than my childhood home, and not some stranger.  

I was thinking about telling my work about me moving sooner rather than later, for a couple of reasons. The first one and least logical one is that I'm awful at keeping my own secrets, and i hate keeping important things from people I care about. It just feels like disingenuous bullshitting w C (my manager and one of my best friends both at and outside of work) as normal while he has no idea I won't be working the following summer. FUCK I'm gonna miss them all, I really am. Work gets annoying but I do love the people I work with and am really grateful for that fact. I doubt I woulda been able to make it this far in recovery without my company, as I first got hired there only like a month after I initially kicked dope and it was def helpful in early recovery having an obligation and structured environment like that.  

Regardless of all that, I'm still super excited to move. Other than working on social media stuff today, I might take my dog for a long walk to the graveyard or river, and get started on cleaning out all the junk from my second bedroom. What are everyone else's plans for this Sunday? Anything fun lined up? If you're just in those first few days and can't do anything but lay in bed and (barely) watch TV, that is an AWESOME fucking plan, i know it feels like slogging through hell right now but this is the best decision you could possibly make, and i promise that despite how difficult it is and unbearable it may seem, life gets 1000x better on the other side.

I stoped when I had a thought one day that this could go on to the future with me and took it as just a moment I had 

I didn‚Äôt really think much of them when I stoped all I had was a runny nose , sneezing a lil depression Some shivers 

I got into some trauma about a week and a half later and that‚Äôs when every thing started 

When the trauma happened I really knew that I wasn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt want any oxys I just wanted to deal with my issue 

I stood home for about 5 days sleeping back to back just thinking I‚Äôm dealing with stuff and taking my time 

But soon after that I felt so much anxiety , racing thoughts , depression , tight chest that felt like I was being stabbed , breathing problems , I was so jittery and inpaicwnt, I couldn‚Äôt focus , shivers and hot flashes   , the worst diarrhea ever ,  i felt like I couldn‚Äôt control any of my emotions 

Soon after I had a panic attack and tbh it was horrible but after it was over I felt great like I was me again and looked in the abulance like why am I here and wanted to go do sum else but that was short lived as it was over in 5 mins and I was exhausted after 

So I went through this and for about a I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so my friend offered a oxy prescribed I hesited because I felt like no I don‚Äôt wanna do drugs when I‚Äôm going through sum and don‚Äôt wanna do oxys at all but she convinced me cause I really couldn‚Äôt take it ...I was scared when I took it .but 30 mins later I felt like my complete self and was eating and watching tv etc 

That‚Äôs when I realized that everything was cause of those pills 

It‚Äôs been about 3 months since and I can‚Äôt take it any more I had I week or two where I felt 80 percent good that when my therapist asked my if I would like to take meds I said no but now I‚Äôm thinking about it

I currently live at home with my parents, and literally every single dollar i make, i spend it all on painkillers. Every day, i keep telling my self i‚Äôm going to save up money so that i can finally go back to school. Every night. i keep telling my self that this will be the last pill i pop, but every morning, the craving is too strong and i cave and end up buying the pill at night.

I understand why she left and don't blame her, but I'm still in love with her. She says she don't hate me, but can't forgive me right now and told me at this point there's no going back. I love her and I know she still has love for me. I know her family and friends look down on dopefiends and probably won't forgive me and are most likely playing a big role in why she won't really talk to me now. 


Like I said I understand and don't blame her for not wanting to forgive me or talk to me, but this really sucks man. All I do is think about her and I'm literally consumed by guilt. I wish I was joking when I say trying to get over this is harder than kicking dope. It's literally weighing me down and the sadness from the whole situation is giving me urges to use. Sorry for ranting but really needed to vent I have no one now!!!

Still, i'd like to know: would it be safe to just quit cold turkey tomorrow or should i take 150mg, then scale down to 100mg, then 50mg and then quit it for good? 

I don't know if i ever experienced withdrawal (i managed to skip one day) because sadly i have other mental health and physical conditions that are really similiar to what an opiate withdrawal would feel like, so i have no idea sadly.

I have an estranged, alcoholic, and destructive father with whom I have no contact. This is very relevant to the below story due to the fact that because of the existing relationship with my father, I swore to myself I could not involve myself with another destructive addict.

Story
Basically, my fianc√© is a drug addict and I'm not sure what to do about it: if I should leave him or stay and try and work through it.

In early June 2021, I caught him crushing up oxycontin to snort. He tried to lie about it but quickly admitted it after I told him I knew something was up. He admitted he started the habit after being cooped up in his office from working hard through covid and being isolated in his office for days on end and becoming a bit depressed because of this. He has had no history of depression in the past that I know of but was forced to go to an outpatient facility in his teens (17) for smoking marijuana (very strict/religious mother). I work nights so our time together has always been a bit finicky. He told me he took the pills orally for 8 to 9 weeks until he decided to snort them for only this last week, so a 10-week habit in total. He has smoked weed almost daily since I met him also and has done so since College (we're 29). He got the pills of the dark web.

We then agreed to then spend some time apart, as he had his parent's house to go to and I had nowhere to go aside from the house we own together. He immediately found a drug counselor whom he saw weekly, and also committed to going to NA meetings. I have met this counselor, whom I like and think is a good fit for him.

We spent about 8 weeks apart. During that time he was with his parents and attended NA meetings daily, working towards their ""90 meetings in 90 days"". His parents kept a close eye on him per both our requests, so he wasn't using during this time period.
About 2 weeks ago we then started to live together again after about 9 weeks from the initial incident.
Things were great, we were happy, we had sex, we did fun things together. He continued to go to meetings and communicate with individuals from those meetings (step work wasn't his thing due to lack of a higher power), he was more active, going to the gym, eating more, etc.
Then yesterday as his workday was ending, I was napping on the couch but got suspicious when he sneakily went upstairs into his old office (he moved his computer stuff downstairs when he moved back in). Lo and behold he was crushing up a pill to snort.

Justifiably I freaked out and asked him wtf.. he told me to drug test him as this was a ""trophy"" he had kept to see if he could beat this while still hanging onto a small amount, mentioning that he thought that if he could keep some and not use it, he had ""beaten it"", those were his words. Obviously that failed. The drug tests came back negative for everything, he also took another test that evening to prove it even further.

I'm at a crossroads here because I had said after the first incident that if I ever found him doing any drugs, weed included, ever again, that I was done. So here we are... what would you do if you were in this situation??

Thanks so much for reading if you've gotten this far.

TL;DR: Caught my fianc√© doing drugs, he swore he wouldn't do them again, he got clean for almost 90 days, then I caught him doing drugs again. What do?

My addiction was different from a lot I hear as I would never take them unless I had a quite space at night like my balcony. My music, my smokes and usually a coffee. I would use them to enhance a form of escapism I already had and would sit on the balcony all night imagining a world with a story were I had certain want and needs met. Somethings I later discovered with my psychologist was just natural wants and needs that I didn‚Äôt realise I never expressed because from a young age I was put down for having them. Simple normal stuff like having a group of friends, romance, respect all basic things. Anyway cut a long story short today I am officially a month clean after many relapses. Not the longest I‚Äôve been clean but the one that feels permanent. I have also quit smoking fully for a month as well. Smoking went hand in hand with this stuff for me and one of the things that has stopped any cravings from taking hold is the understanding that if I wanted to do poppy tea or something I would have to smoke again and I had no desire to reintroduce my body to nicotine addiction not that I‚Äôve finally quit it. It‚Äôs funny but that has been what has put an immediate stop to any cravings taking over. I wated a man today argue with a chemist that he wanted his pain meds early despite what his doctor had written and I realised if I never stopped that that would have been me still as it was me in the past. Caused me to reach out here just to share because to be honest I cannot believe this was who I was and how far I‚Äôve come.

Firstly, I have a daughter who has autism. I am her primary caregiver and she is awesome. She is able to communicate but also has self injurious behavior and can get kind of violent. Obviously it‚Äôs very stressful and sad. This has been going on for a few years but we are in a good rhythm/ pretty able to manage it. What makes it hard though is my husband has a couple close family members that live out of state and he is their primary caregiver. One person is his mother and she is an alcoholic and also has Alzheimer‚Äôs and lives alone‚Äî in a different state. We just got news that her caregiver quit. That she was too hard for him to deal with. She refuses to accept care from strangers. 
Soooo‚Ä¶.. my husband‚Äòs going to have to basically live with her for a while until we figure out what to do. I will be alone taking care of my house and our daughter. I have done this before but this has been going on off on for a few years and I am drained. In the past I would do a tiny bit of drugs just to have the energy/drive to keep up.

I've used several different methods to get clean but this time I am seriously fucking over it. I want to be done and be done for good. Lately I've been using about .2-.3 of white fent (smoked). I was using daily for about 6 months. The past 3 months I've been tapering back. For example, in the last week, I've only smoked three times. About .2 each. I've noticed that my withdrawls don't get bad until day 3. I'm really hoping that because I've been taking breaks (and they were painful and not fun but manageable) I'm hoping this withdrawl will be a lot easier. In fact, last time I went a full three days, and the biggest issue I had was psychological. No diahreeah, RLS, etc. Is it possible because I've been taking breaks that the withdrawals won't be that bad? Has anyone ever tried to quit this way?

I have a few comfort meds, and I've started to do light exercise. I'm determined to make this my last quit. It's been 48 hours and I feel ok. From what I've read, withdawls ""peak"" at 3 days. But I'm dreading that because it's fent, it's stored in my fat cells and maybe the worst doesn't come until 6 days or more.

I'm hoping to get some good news, but I'd also not wanting to be lied to. Any feedback would be appreciated! Would love some good news, but some tough love might be needed as well... Really the worst part is the sweats. With H withdrawl I'd be deathly sick by day 2, day 3 would be awful, and then by day 4 I'm be on the upswing. But is fent different?

Hi,

Me and my SO have been taking Tramadol all summer, slowly increasing our dosage from 100 mg one or twice a week in beginning of June through July and then increasing our dosage and stopped 2 days ago at 400 mg/day. So we have steadily increased our dosage over three months, in the beginning it was 1-2 times a week.

We are on day 4 of our withdrawals, the body aches and pain is almost gone for both of us, but my SO is experiencing immense anxiety and almost apathy. She can't do anything productive that requires brain function and she feels such anxiety that she just lies in bed.

I wish I could turn back time or push a button for this all to go away.
