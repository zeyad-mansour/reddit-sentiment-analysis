I don't know where else to go.,"My brother (32) has been using opiates for about 13 years. We have had some very low points throughout those yesrs. In and out of rehab. More car accidents than I want to remember.  Enough of that. 

One month ago he got out of rehab again. We thought this time it was different.  He talked about it openly. He got a sponsor.  He asked for help. Yesterday the whole family was together (my parents, 2 sisters, my husband, my daughter and me) for Thanksgiving and he was visibly messed up. Dipping out and, and his eyes.. 

We all as a family got together and talked about it. He admitted it. We talked about a lot of how we felt and how he felt. He expressed that he needs something to keep him busy with his active mind (he has really bad ADHD). 

He is a generally active guy so I suggested Jujitsu but what would be some realistic things he can try to help find a healthy activity?

Then wham, the car accident.  I was in pain and housebound and depressed.  For months.  I left the hospital with 12 5mg pills.  Fuck that.  I advocated for myself. I found my medication, what I needed to get through the days and nights.  

Then I recovered somewhat and went back to my job that I despise.  A few more blues binges, and kratom and a few subs here there.  Last week I suffered in silence.  I got some sort of virus and with some xanax I rode out the suffering of withdrawal.  

She couldn't figure out why I was a zombie. I broke down and told her.  Instead of being PROUD of me... I am free of the horrible acutes!!... I quit kratom and oxy hopefully for real this time!!

I haven't had a drink or mind altering drug since the start of 2018. I do work an AA program but I am not super hardline about it. I might drink one day but this is working very well right now. When I got sober I had just cought my second felony arrest and my university told me they didn't much care to have me as a student anymore. Which was fine with me because I was much more concerned with the instant gratification of mainlining fentanyl than my future. After my running buddy od'd for the idk how manyth time In 2017 I decided to get on suboxone. I stayed on it for 3 or 4 months before i decided i was ready to get sober. At the same time i figured i might as well finish up my last few credits at university. I sold my car for dopemoney at some point in 2016. So I would wake up every morning at 4 a.m in the middle of winter, in suboxone w.d, and take the bus across town for school and work. So for those of us our there in the w.d just know that it can be done with the proper support and motivation.
I currently have my degree and I'm working as a public school teacher. I'm not particularly happy with my profession and will be changing soon but for a guy like me with a built in fuck it button, it is a testament to the possibilities of recovery that I have made it this far. I pay my Bill's on time, I see my kid regularly, and I show up when I say I'm going to. And I think that's what the vast majority of people want for themselves.",14,0

Just another reminder about why I never want to live that way ever again.,"https://www.newstartrecovery.com/2018/06/why-do-addicts-end-up-in-hotels/

The article leaves out the most important reason (imo) and that‚Äôs bc we are homeless and have nowhere else to go. Yeah, it‚Äôs costly but much better than being out under a bridge or in a tent somewhere.  

Article reminded me of why I love being clean and I need these little reminders; especially around the holidays and all of the stress that comes w it. At least we‚Äôre awake for the feelings of unrest or uneasy-ness (restless, irritable, and discontent). Feeling feelings sucks sometimes but I‚Äôd much rather feel the bad ones in order to feel the good ones bc when the good ones are good, they‚Äôre really good. 

Holidays are times where many people slip and I just wanted to remind all of you warriors out there that it‚Äôs better to be uncomfortable for a bit than to go back to having a shitstorm for a life. Many clubhouses run meetings back to back to back all through the holidays so taking an hour out of the festivities to get right w your recovery can be super helpful. I know for me it‚Äôs a must. I‚Äôm not willing to go back to jumping from hotel to hotel while dragging all my shit around in a garbage bag w me. F that. 

If you made it through the day without using you‚Äôre a miracle. If an addict can remain clean for an amount of time that‚Äôs a miracle and I love all of you fuckin miracles out there rocking the f out of this recovery shit. You‚Äôre not alone and I love you all. ‚ù§Ô∏è",23,0

It's just as I no longer want to be using illegal drugs I think I will no doubt go into a cold turkey withdrawal before I'm able to be put on methadone.

I was on prescribed opiates for 16 years. After that amount of time, even if you don‚Äôt move to something harder, you‚Äôll have quite the love/hate relationship with opiates. I was being tapered off as my doctor is retiring in a few years, and I was very close to suicide as a result of the pain and my chemical dependency fucking with me. In July I had enough - and I mean ‚Äòmade peace with every last facet of this situation‚Äô enough - and decided to quit without telling anyone, even my prescribing doctor. I jumped off 100mg of oxyIR/day. 

Withdrawal was brutal, PAWS more so (still is, of course, but manageable now). I‚Äôm not on MAT. I have nothing against MAT and think it‚Äôs an awesome resource for those who need it, but I didn‚Äôt want another chain to be elegantly wrapped around my ankle. I‚Äôm 38, and I‚Äôve spent virtually my entire adulthood with my opiate receptors flooded by pharmaceutical grade dope - and that reign had to end. Somehow I knew this was something I needed to go through, and in this way, for better or for worse - and I share this because I feel that we all have our own subjective take on sobriety, with one not being better or worse than the other so long as it works for that individual. 

It feels really good to be clean. There is no more profound feeling in this world, and in this life, than experiencing pleasure, happiness and contentment while clean, especially when juxtaposed against the twin peaks of opiate highs and withdrawals. Also, not waking up in the morning in withdrawal due to the short half-life of oxycodone has to be on the short-list for my top three favorite things I can never share with normal people because they‚Äôll look at me like my head is on fire. 

Anyway, I want to thank you guys for sharing your stories and your struggles. You gave me something that I didn‚Äôt have whatsoever during that dark period of my life: hope, the motivation to kick, and the knowledge with which to do so. I‚Äôm grateful as hell for that.",62,0

I have wanted to get off the patches for the last couple of years. I currently take 75mcg every 48 hours. One of the biggest reasons why I want to quit is because of the withdrawals that I have went through a few times over the past several years for various reasons. I've had issues with new physicians and insurance and been without the patch for 1-3 days at a time. The worst time was the three days (duh) of withdrawals and it felt like three years. My wife and kids were hesitant to even speak to me during this time. I laid in bed all three days and felt I was literally physically and mentally in hell. I HATE being so dependent on this medication, but I'm terrified to go through that again. I would give anything to go back in time and stay off the patches for a few more days.

I am scared that one day my insurance will decide to not pay for my patches and I will be screwed. So the threat of withdrawals is the main reason why I want to quit. My pain management doc has suggested working together and tapering over a long period of time. I'm also concerned that all my pain will come back in full force. The patches were the only thing that worked for me. I have never taken any ""illegal"" drugs (not even pot) , but there were times during those three days I would have taken anything to feel normal. One of my doctors mentioned that he's had a couple patients that managed to get off with the help of marijuana. Unfortunately, it's not legal in my state at the moment.

I've been on suboxone for five years. 16mg daily up until a 30 days ago when i switched to 300mg sublocade subdermal injection. The transition was relatively painless, and other than the psychological ""need"" to dose on two occasions (4mg both times,) its been smooth. 

The medication has been a godsend, and the level of stability i've established in my life is beyond what i could have ever expected. However i believe the medication is now counter-productive, as although i eat fine and exercise regularly, i have no sex drive which has impacted my marriage, and i have a overall general malaize that i can't seem to shake.

Everything i've read on sublocade confirms it has, in essence, its own ""natural"" taper due to the longevity of the drug. I was wondering if anyone had experience with just not returning for another shot and riding it out, and if withdrawal was experienced. 

I would like to stop buprenorphine entirely. I do have 10 8mg films from previous prescriptions as well as other ""comfort"" meds,  but i just want some encouragement i guess that I CAN and WILL accomplish this. I do have a doctor on standby should i find myself in a jam, but idk im just rambling at this point.

I found out about 3-4 months into the relationship, and we‚Äôve been together close to a year now. In the very beginning I noticed him nodding out a couple times and he told me he used percocets because of his injured hand. I was very naive to opiates and what they did to the body/what to look for so i had no idea he was constantly using. Soon after he came clean to me about his using heroin, he went into rehab and relapsed immediately. After a pretty rough summer he got on suboxone. He would still relapse once a week, right after his doctors appointment so he would piss clean for his test the following week. After a bit he had a month clean and I finally thought we were at the light at the end of the tunnel. Right around he had a month clean he relapsed again and he‚Äôs been using a couple times a week since. With maybe a week or two of clean time inbetween.  

He has a really rough past, paired with bipolar disorder. I‚Äôm not justifying his use but i get it. he‚Äôs been using for the better part of 12 years with He‚Äôs pockets of sobriety-ish with the help of suboxone. I know this isn‚Äôt something that is going to happen over night, I know it‚Äôs going to take a lot of hard work from his end, and that he has to fully want this to commit. I know he wants this, he wants a normal life with a career and a family and friends etc but when he gets just the little bit of discouragement that things aren‚Äôt going his way he goes out and gets high. Multiple times during his relapses he would hug me crying asking why he can‚Äôt stop. It honestly breaks my heart.

I loce this man to death. He‚Äôs brilliant, funny, caring, kind, everything i‚Äôve always looked for personality-wise in a partner. He‚Äôs the first person I ever imagined a future with. Getting a house, marriage, babies etc, but not if he‚Äôs going to be in active addiction the rest of our lives. I know i‚Äôm powerless in this, I can help him and be there for him as much as possible, but at the end of the day all the decisions are up to him. 

So the point of this post, 1. was to express my feelings out and maybe organize my thoughts because I want to have a sit down conversation with him about his future/our future and his goals in getting fully clean. 2. to ask for help. What helped you all to get clean? What did you do when you were in this stage of wanting to get clean but still relapsing? What helped you finally get over that last hurdle? 

Sorry for the long post but I can‚Äôt just sit around and let my best friend hurt himself anymore. I need to stop being scared and sweeping this issue under the rug just hoping for it to get better.

Back then the struggle was real, every day pains and regrets slapping me in the face, but in a way I felt more free those first few hundred days than I do even today. I had a clear objective, and I met it when my head hit the pillow clean for another day. 

Today, I still become a captive of other things, from food choices to my own failures of life management. I let them occupy my personal thoughts and let them run portions of my life. 

Let‚Äôs grow together!

I have had a lot of success since day 1, because I‚Äôm doing the right things, but I‚Äôm still working on doing them for the right reasons. 

Because I learned to give up something, for a cause greater than myself, I have credibility as a leader. No, not because everyone knows what I‚Äôve done, or what I had to give up, but because the wisdom I gained through this process is evident in my every day actions. 

That process included what we did here, in /R/OR. I am forever grateful this Thanksgiving, for having this outlet when I needed it most. 

Blessed be the journey!",2,0

However my significant other has started using crack again. It is literally breaking me. I've taken to giving plasma twice a week so we can have money to live on. Again, however, by time I leave the plasma center to the time I get home (20 minutes) I'm broke again. I get paid at 3 a.m. every Thursday and by noon my account is down to maybe a dollar and nothing is bought for the house, i.e., groceries, toilet paper, tooth paste, nothing!

He keeps telling me he doesn't want my money but he sure does take it when I have it. I can barely pay my cell phone bill or my car insurance. The last two weeks my account is overdrawn on Wednesday. His solution is ""well you get paid tomorrow.""

I love him more than I can put into words and he tells me I'm the love of his life. I truly believe him and believe in him. He was clean for about 9 months. Then, of course, some guy approached him asking if he wanted some smoke. His urge was strong and he gave in. Again, I've been broke ever since.

How can I get him to see that we can't afford this. He can't afford this! I struggle with my own demons in this area. I've gotten to the point that I stay in the bedroom most of the time when I'm not at work, and he stays in the living room. It's like, two people in one apartment in separate rooms. He watches t.v. and smokes, while I stay away from him. Doesn't he realize this is tearing me up and tearing us apart. 

I know many are thinking I should just leave, but I can't. One because I have nowhere to go and two because I don't want to walk out on what use to be a really good relationship. I know if he would stop using we could have our old relationship back. This is his favorite time of year so why is he messing it up?

I know most are positive thinkers here and would probably tell me to move out or move on but I can't. Some will tell me that it will get better, and I know it can. Unfortunately, nobody can tell me how long it will take before the ""better"" gets here.

Anyway, I've rattled on long enough. If you've made it this far reading my rantings - thanks for that!",31,0

I have done every drug there is, but it wasn't until my early 20s I realized opiates gave me a feeling I wanted to feel forever. I was more social, less insecure, happier, more energized, and most importantly not only did it kill the physical pain but it was a great emotional pain reliever as well. It seemed the perfect cure for the lonlieness and pain I knew all too well.  Here I am some 10-12 years later wrecking my life once again because heroin is my master. I've lost over a dozen friends to this disease as well as my own brother..and just 2 weeks ago my cousin that was my best friend growing up. I don't feel like explaining my many arrests, incarcerations, a total of 10 rehabs later or the people I've hurt, the things I've lost, the damage to my health, the shame, guilt, despair,worthlessness, misery, and pure exhaustion I feel constantly. All I need to say is no matter how many times it takes every single thing from me and just completely ruins my life, for some reason I always go back. I am a slave to heroin and maybe it will end up killing me too. I'm on day 2 detoxing and each second I am hanging on as tight as I can not to go score. It's taking everything I have got to keep fighting and pushing forward. I'm so tired and I am so fucking terrified I will always be a junkie and I will end up dying a junkie. When will I have had enough misery and loss?  No matter how many times I get clean, I always go back. I don't want to be this way anymore but I am afraid the damage is done and there is no hope for me because unfortunately no matter how hard I try and as strong as I think I am.. heroin calls the shots. Heroin controls my life. Heroin is my master and I'm afraid he's never gonna let me go ...

I found out my bf is addicted to muscle relaxers. I would say he is in recovery. Unfortunately, I found out by seeing him on them. When he met up with me, he was clearly inebriated and high on something. When he was coming down from his high, he explained how his best friend passed away recently, and this triggered him to use that day.

He then opened up about moving away from his hometown two years ago to live a more sober life. We only live 2hours away though, so he has went back to buy pills in the past. 

He went to rehab in the past around 2016, and his use has diminished from daily, to weekly, now to monthly. With that being said, he told me that he uses maybe once or twice a month if he gets his supply from his home town, when he‚Äôs upset. And he said he has used all of his supply, and had no more left. Also, that he took the pills only because he found them when he was cleaning out some old boxes.

He agreed that it still is an issue, and would like to be sober. He doesn‚Äôt want to go to rehab again, and feels he doesn‚Äôt need it. He says if he started using again more often, rehab is something he would try again. But he wants to go back to naranon meetings again, and bring me with him. 

I have never been with someone who has an addiction, but I wanted to ask you all if rehab is something you feel you needed to revisit when recovering? I am interested in helping him continue to recover and work towards a sober life. ofcourse everything is completely this choice, but I just want proper education.

Also, if you guys have any advice on the best ways your loved ones have supported you, please feel free to share. 

Lastly, if you know of any subreddits dedicated to support for loved ones of those in recovery, I would love to find a place of support like that. Thank you.",1,0

I started using it rectally knowing that I could get more out of it 3x the potency (1mg bupe = 3mg rectally) I did 1mg 3x daily rectally equaling about 9mg a day because of the bioavailability of buprenorphine rectally.

If you have muscle relaxers use them, melatonin helps too. Be careful with kratom, it can prolong withdrawal and be addictive itself and you don't want to become a slave to that but I'd much rather be dependent on legal kratom that's easily accessible and has way less of a withdrawal so if you need to go for it. I'm not using anythint at the moment but I've used kratom  three times within the three weeks when I felt my absolute lowest and yes it helps but that's because it's an opiate.

unfortunately I could not get though my H WD sucessfully. I am still on and that sucks. 
But I want/need to switch to methadone now for the next 6 weeks.

It's a fact that metha WD is much harder than heroin. But I could not afford the habit at the current rate that long, therefore the switch.

I need to take 12 mg to get the WD away, but I guess I will be steady at 8mg/d and taper down ~0.5mg each week. And jump off at 4 mg.

I Wd'd often from H, and was getting better at day 5,and comfortable (to function at work at least) after 2 weeks.

I only get 3 weeks off. Will it be enough for M WD?
Or should I even switch to H a week before, so my WD will be shorter (but mentally harder, bc you got that H feeling still in mind and it will be very fresh).

Ive been entirely ungrateful for my life up until this day. Anxiety plays a huge role in my life and I need to be more pro active with that and less self medicating. But just because I'm anxious doesnt mean I'm insane. So why do i repeat the same addictive action expecting something, ANYTHING to change. How can I not realize that's the definition of insanity. Wake up kid. Stop wasting your life . 

Every day I wake up, feeling like I did something wrong. I often let that dictate my actions. ""Do bad things since I feel bad, so now it makes sense"". But a few things need to change to make that behavior more manageable. Realizing that I dont have to be sorry for my own existence is the huge. Realizing I can be anyone or do anything is even better. Quitting drugs is almost the best. But planning for the future and quitting drugs is the bestest.

The unknowns of a family get together are perplexing to say the least. Will my uncle show up fall out drunk? Will there be judging eyes cast upon me for why I am unmarried and in school at 29 years old? How will I deal with the social anxiety of attending an event which I really don't care to join in on? I have no major accolades in comparison to some of the people at this event and I shine like a lump of coal in comparison to the people that will be there. I will be on the fringes of this social gathering as far as merit, money, and even looks are concerned.

I don't mean to sound like a scrooge but I don't know if I want to go. I have delayed the responsibilities of becoming an adult and I'm almost 30. The only time I have lived on my own is in the state penitentiary. I learned a lot of positive skills in there including avoidance, which is sometimes necessary. Avoidance is tricky though, it can be like water building up on a levee which can no longer hold. Before my stay in the big house I had no idea how to deal with emotions, so, being taught coping skills was a positive aspect of my stay. Some negative habits I had included polysubstance abuse, overeating, smoking etc.

I feel like a balloon looks when pressure is applied to specific areas. Observation of this balloon under pressure reveals deformity, it expands into other places looking for relief. I want total equilibrium, but I can't seem to reach it. It's like I have conquered all the major health hazards, and still want to fall back on negative coping mechanisms recently. I soon went to the grocer to purchase items for a thanksgiving dish, which included real maple syrup. I was feeling stressed last night and ate half the container on some basic bread. I woke up this morning hungover from sugar with the realization that I had turned back to old habits, these abhorrent behaviors that I had sworn away.

I figure its nice to share something that can make people chuckle when they are going through withdrawals.

It was one of the last times i bought Heroin, i believe it was October 2018. My friend and i picked up our bags and proceeded to head home about a half hour away.
We decided we needed a snack or drink can‚Äôt remember exactly why we stopped but we pulled into the local 711, grabbed our stuff and hit the road. Pulling out of the lot we noticed a cop pass us, hit the breaks and than make a circle to get on the highway to follow after us. I knew we were fucked, and then realized his inspection was dead. Good, it may just be a minor traffic stop. I told him to take a right on the next gravel backroad to try to make it out of sight but they caught up and took a right, right after us. I told my self Fuck if I‚Äôm gonna go this long with using and get caught now, So i shoved the bagged up gram of Heroin up my ass. First and last time i put Heroin in my ass. They hit the lights, the cop comes to the car, asks for our IDs, runs them and then asks us to get out of the vehicle. Another cop pulls up behind the first officer to accompany him and start to question us, mostly about why is his inspection is dead and why he is driving on a suspended license. After a while of explaining the situation and no probable cause to search us (except maybe the fact my friend looks like a younger Ron Jeremy and apparently i look like a Junkie Aaron Rodgers, still not enough probable cause) MY stupid ass starts to shuffle through my jacket pocket for a lighter right when the cop is shining his flash light on me,  i dropped my lighter on the ground and also a little clear container i forgot i had with 1  10 mg methadone tablet inside. My heart literally stopped and i look at the cop straight in the face as he is shining his light down on the container and lighter. I made no sudden moves except for bending down slowly, Heroin clenched in the asshole and all, and grabbed the container and lighter putting it back into my pocket. He looked at me, turned off his light and said you can leave.... To this day i still don‚Äôt know if that cop was a complete idiot and didn‚Äôt see what i dropped, or if he felt bad knowing we were junkies and decided to let us go. Oh well, glad I don‚Äôt have to to experience these situations anymore and now i can laugh at all the stupid shit i did back when i was using, Shit maybe its a story to tell the kids one day if that ever happens haha.

I played myself and now i‚Äôm back to square one. My addiction has always been pain pills, whatever I could really get my hands on. Oxys mostly for the last year or so. In september I decided to get clean and I got up to a month. Then something happend. One weekend of partying with pills turned into a full blown month of non stop pill munchin. But this weekend I found myself at the bottom. 

I got some hydromorphone from my plug and shit have I ever gotten as fucked up from dope as I have from those pills. Did not feel really good anymore and just looking myself in the mirror high as hell was just the most ugly sight ever. I knew I had to get clean, shit just was not the same anymore.

On sunday I was coming heavy down from the hydromorphone and decided to go see a girl and chill with her while she was coming down off E.  Well we went to smoke some weed that night and I took all the hydro that I had left ( 12mg ) + 30mg of oxy. I was fucked. While we were smoking all of a sudden a cop pulls up and catches us totally off guard. Really could not do anything so we just went with it. Dude found like 3 grams of weed on me and some oxys in bag. They let the girl go but I found myself in the back of a police van. What the fuck man, I just got clean and everything was going good. This made me feel so sick of myself, not even the high I was on could help me feel better. After a moment they were done with me and let me go. I had a long conversation with the cops and they were really nice dudes who really wanted to help, but I told them ill be good. They took my weed but in the end gave my pills back. I was like what. They just gave them back and handed me a ticket for the bud and left. 

This just fucked me up. Even though it was a good thing I got them back and didnt get anything for those, in what kinda society do you get a ticket for nature‚Äôs own medicine and have to deal with the cops for smoking some, but then for pills like opiates they just give them back at you and be like yeah keep on poppin son. 

I don‚Äôt know why but this just messed me up. The next morning I looked at those pills and threw them away. I‚Äôve had enough. Enough of the lies and deception, the bullshit and pain that this lifestyle has brought me. On monday morning I stopped and it‚Äôs a battle to stay away.

Ok so, my boyfriend used to do heroin 10 years ago for 2-3 years the first time, quit with medication (subutex) and one and a half year ago, he got into heroin again, and took way more than 10y ago, like really more. 
Now he stoped with medication (methadone), it's been 1y nearly and he's still taking methadone (200mg or less/day, he said to me that not every one is at this high dose).
 I love him and I want him to be happy and I know that he might have to keep it that way for a long time, but I would love to have some advice on how to make him stop thinking about heroin, and stop methadone one day but for good you know?
I know I'm asking something complicated, he's seeing a psychologist that help him a lot, but at his home there is always trouble so that fuck up the good thing his psycho did.",1,0

Our goal is to fill the gap between the common culture addicts share and the path of lifetime recovery, taking a realistic view of opioid addiction and those affected by it. Our group seeks to be what traditional support groups lack: in tune with today‚Äôs culture, a comforting environment for people of all walks of life and stages of recovery, realistic integration from the life of an addict to regular society, and a purpose to help others recover as well. The DAAO empowers members to take recovery into their own hands, and shares an environment where addicts can be themselves, uninhibited by the strict guidelines found in traditional groups, such as 12 step programs. 

We offer:
-regular scheduled group meetings
-non-religious support methods
-harm reduction clinics
-one on one counseling with recovered addicts
-weekend activities
-work force prep
-much more  

Our group emphasizes comfort and acceptance for all members. We believe a genuine understanding and acceptance from ones peers is the best foundation for a recovering addict to stand on. With our experience and support, anyone has the ability to recover. For more information, visit our website or Facebook page found below.

Well, where to start.. I'm 24, male, engeneer, employee of US corporation. Live and work in Moscow, Russia. Now, the tough part..

Started using opiates about.. Hell, about 3 years ago. Or even 4... 

It doesn't matter, what important is that about 2 years ago I quit heroine and start using methadone.

Important note: we don't have methadone therapy supported by government, so I'm using substance that drastically differs from staff, that guys in r/Methadone are discussing. And that's where come real problems: instead taking pills or something like that, I'm using syringe to make shots. Methadone burns like hell, so I've lost almost all my veins.

I have tried to quit. Tried not to prick myself, but withdrawal syndrome is killing me.. I would definitely go to hospital and ask for special treatment, but there are three issues: firstly, in Russia it is very hard to live, if you have this kind of record. It is like a curse, and not only people will try to avoid you ‚Äî but also many general life consequences, for example, you'd be unable to update your driver lincense (I have one) and etc.
Secondly, I am afraid to reveal such things to my gf and my family.. Just want to save then from painful truth about what kind of abomination I am..
Lastly, there will be serious job consequences, and I can't afford to loose mine, because I am only person in family who's able to make money..

I am asking for your help. Is it possible to quit by yourself? How can I alleviate withdrawal? How long will withdrawal syndrome lasts? I will appreciate any kind of advice or support, because at the moment I feel like I am completely lost and there's no hope for me..",2,0

I want to do a super rapid detox with this patch, just to take away the acute symptoms of wd and definitely not get high from it.

I have a degree in business from a really good university here on the east coast. I come from a wealthy family and for the longest time, my parents would pay for basically everything. My rent, food...even recreation. Welp, that is TOTALLY over now (I‚Äôm 24 now btw) you can scoff at the fact I had that privilege, but I‚Äôm so, so grateful for the life my parents have given me. I think a common misconception with kids who come from a wealthier-ish family is that we are spoiled. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case at all, I really only asked for the bare minimum. I‚Äôve had jobs since I was 14. And now, I‚Äôm finally and totally on my own. It‚Äôs a GREAT feeling and I‚Äôm SO happy to be independent. The only problem is, is this horrible heroin habit I have. It‚Äôs so bad now. I was getting better a few months ago but lately I‚Äôm spending 1k a week on it, maybe a tad bit less. Well, I can‚Äôt afford it anymore. Truth be told here to anyone whose read this much, I don‚Äôt even really WANT to stop. I know that‚Äôs so fucked up, but half of me wants to stop soso soso badly, and the other half wants to keep it going. The realist in me knows I can‚Äôt.

So I‚Äôll try to give my background of events but I am writing this sentence as I‚Äôm realizing what I wrote so far so this will be a very long post. If you don‚Äôt want to read it, I totally get it. I will add a very small TL;DR at the bottom. 

First, I‚Äôm a 29F (will be 30 Dec 1st and I‚Äôm def not ready for that ha). I was on Vicoprofen 7.5mg for my lower back for about a year prescribed by my PCP while I had every test and scan done possible to figure out what was wrong with my lower back. In between the time of being on Vicoprofen, I had gotten dumped by my first love/real relationship and a few months after that, I lost my oldest brother who was Schizophrenic. He used drugs and alcohol to self medicate and the cause of his death was an accidental overdose. I have some slight PTSD from that morning. Between the time my ex dumped me and my brother passed away, I went from 136lbs to 103lbs. I just couldn‚Äôt eat from the depression, anxiety and stress. I was drinking boost shakes daily just to have SOMETHING in me. The day my brother died, I actually ended up in the ER because I hadn‚Äôt had my daily boost drink and we were at the police station (they had to question us since he died at home) when I became very faint. I ended up having very low potassium so I got 1 or 2 bags of that and everything else was fine. I went to my PCP the Monday after my brother had died (which was a Saturday) to get medicine to increase my appetite. I took one dose and my appetite was back and I began eating and gaining weight back. During all of this, I was still on Vicoprofen. There were a few times a week I‚Äôd take extra. I was prescribed 3 pills per day I believe. I would probably take around 6 pills some days during the week. I only have ever taken them (and any pain medication prescribed) orally. I would make sure I always had enough to last me until I could get a refill. The max I took was 9 of them in a 15 hour period. Never all at once and taking that many was VERY rare. That scared me when I even did that. Drugs do scare me. I was not abusing the Vicoprofen the entire year on them but I believe it was probably for 6-7 months that I‚Äôd abuse them 

I saw myself abusing them and got scared because of what happened to my brother. I was thankfully self aware. My PCP said there‚Äôs a medicine called suboxone but she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know that much about it‚Äù. I had been seeing her for over 10 years and trusted her. I went to a psychiatrist not having any idea what suboxone was except that it helps withdrawal (that‚Äôs all I was told or knew) and long story short: I was thrown on 2mg. I did a year and a half long taper off of it. I was on it for 4.5 years total. So yay, I got off suboxone with minimal physical withdrawal! My physical issue still is that am extremely fatigue. 

One day about 2.5 months ago, my back pain came back. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I didn‚Äôt continue to find out what was wrong prior to this because of a few things. First, suboxone took every ounce of energy I had from me. I tell everyone how all I did was exist for 4.5 years. I only went to my psychiatrist and the pharmacy and both were to get my suboxone. I showered every other month or I would go even longer sometimes (yes that‚Äôs gross, I know. I kept myself clean in other ways but that‚Äôs an example of the shape I was in) and that kept me from going out. I wasn‚Äôt agoraphobic before and I wasn‚Äôt agoraphobic then. I just couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt want to leave home. So as I said above, I didn‚Äôt bother to try and figure out what was wrong with my back because I couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt leave the house. And second, I realized 2.5 months after being off suboxone, the pain was numbed the entire by the suboxone since it‚Äôs an opiate so it didn‚Äôt hurt me that bad. 

So back to 2.5 months ago, the pain got very severe one day and my mom is prescribed 5mg of Oxycodone (4x/day) for chronic pain and she gave me one. One did absolutely nothing. The second did and the second also gave me the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù feeling. The feeling of still being very much myself, not confused or dazed. I just had that good feeling. I ended up taking 1 sometimes 2 of them for 2.5 weeks. The most I did take though was 4 one day. Then she ran out. I did some lying to get the extra ones from her but most of the time I actually was in pain.
**Quick side note: My mom is an RN BSN. She also is NOT an addict. She is extremely smart and she is most definitely NOT an enabler nor would she ever be especially after losing my brother. This was her trusting me.**
A majority of the time, she never needs any (not that it matters regardless, still wasn‚Äôt ok on my part) pain medicine so that‚Äôs why I was able to take some. When I took one and it wasn‚Äôt for pain, I would tell my mom either right away or a few hours later. I can‚Äôt hide anything from her or I will be ridden with guilt. She‚Äôs my best friend. I tell her everything and I‚Äôm so thankful I have that open relationship with her where I can be honest. Once she ran out after 2.5 weeks, I stopped. I craved at first but it did go away. Then she got a refill 2 weeks later and was honest with me about having gotten it. I obviously still have this back issue and haven‚Äôt done anything about it so I would ask for one. She held on to them and hid them from me. But she‚Äôd leave some loose and I‚Äôd be sneaky with them. I hate writing this because I‚Äôm so mad at myself. This behavior isn‚Äôt like me. Last Saturday, November 9th, I took the last of the Oxycodone which was 10mg. I never took more then 20mg in 24 hours. 

So the following Sunday I woke up and obviously was craving. I took 0.5mg of Xanax (I am prescribed 0.5mg 3x/day and usually I only take 1mg/day at bed time) and fell asleep after crying. I slept from Sunday night to Friday morning. Friday I finally got up. I hardly ate this last week. I had my period as well and I‚Äôve noticed my depression gets very very bad when I get my period. I cry at least once a day. I‚Äôm doing better now that my periods almost done (sorry for the TMI to the men reading this but hormones and just getting off subs is one hell of a mix lmao plus important for me to add in for the women reading this) and I‚Äôm 7 days off of the Oxycodone. I do plan to see about getting on birth control for my hormones right now. Aside from that, I only get a tiny bit of craving here and there but not much.

Now to my *actual* reason for posting here:
My point of coming here was because of having significant weight loss. I have had almost zero appetite since getting off suboxone. I would actually get more hungry when I‚Äôd take Oxycodone which was random. But I still was at a low weight. As I said above, my lowest was 103. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù. The other day I hit 100lbs, I went up to 102 and then it went down again 3 days later to 99lbs. Today, I saw 98lbs on the scale. I wanted to crumble and cry. I am a naturally thin girl. I‚Äôm more likely to stick between 120-125lbs when healthy. I naturally have thin arms and thin legs. Those don‚Äôt look much different. But my collarbones are obviously showing more and my hip bones pop out more. My stomach is ‚Äúflat‚Äù but not unhealthy looking. It‚Äôs mainly my hips and collarbones. It‚Äôs so easy for people to tell me to eat or to drink a protein shake and I do when I can. But we all know when we aren‚Äôt hungry, we just aren‚Äôt going to be able to force it. And that‚Äôs how I get. When I feel hungry, I instantly eat. I‚Äôm just upset. I personally feel like people almost made a stereotypical physical appearance to what an addict looks like. I guess a few examples might be that they look dirty, have ripped clothes, too thin, acne (which I have always had), pale, lots of tattoos and piercings... you get my point. If you know Demi Lovato, she posted a picture the other day of her and her new boyfriend and people have immediately deemed him a junky because of his outward appearance and because they know her past with addiction. It‚Äôs so sad. If you saw me, while I‚Äôm thin, you‚Äôd never think this would be my position. But I feel as if I have that stereotypical look that I explained. I‚Äôm pale, thin and have acne which I have always had. It‚Äôs just what I think. No one has said this to me nor do I know if anyone has thought it. Just an FYI, I have an amazing support system made of family, friends, the best therapist and a great psychiatrist as well. They all also know most of this. 

It‚Äôs seeing 98lbs on the scale today that hit me hard. This isn‚Äôt on purpose. I want to look healthy again. I want to be happy and healthy again. I know a lot of this aftermath is from suboxone. I know my slip up with the Oxycodone didn‚Äôt help and I am done with that. I‚Äôm not proud of myself and I truly am devastated about my overall physical appearanceü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòï. 

If you read this far, thank you. I don‚Äôt know why I wrote this. Maybe for some feedback or to get some encouragement. Although I haven‚Äôt read everyone‚Äôs recovery on here, I support you all and think you‚Äôre doing an amazing job! Keep pushing through! I also am always here if anyone needs to chat‚ù§Ô∏è!

**TL;DR:** I was on suboxone for 4.5 years. Been off it 18 weeks today. Had a little slip up with Oxycodone. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight and it‚Äôs upsetting me tremendously.",1,0

The first two were horrible even though I was inducted on 8mg suboxone within my first 20 hours. Every day they've dropped me down and by the seventh day (my last day here) I'm supposed to be dropped down to 1mg taken once in the morning.

I'm currently on 2mg and having no symptoms except some soreness and disorientation, but I'm so scared that once they suboxone wears off I'll be hit with severe withdrawals again. I was originally on a mix of opiates that had been laced with fentanyl and benzos unbeknownst to me like an idiot, and the amount was anywhere from 20-40mg for around 3-4 months after dealing with my father's suicide.

&#x200B;

My question is, if I'm on only 2mg of suboxone right now and feeling okay 12 hours later (tomorrows dose would be 1mg in the morning and night, then next day would be 1mg only in the morning, if that makes sense), is that usually a good sign that once I'm weened completely off, my withdrawals will be pretty mild? It just sounds too good to be true that I'd have NO withdrawals whatsoever coming off this stuff.

I‚Äôve always been a lurker and too anxious to post on here, huge panic disorder. But fuck it, I did it. I made it 1 year without putting a single opiate into my body and I‚Äôm proud of myself. 

I‚Äôll make this short but a year ago, on November 1st 2018 I got arrested on my multiple warrants, out of state so I knew I was getting extradited. Laying in my cell, puking all over myself cause I couldn‚Äôt get up to the toilet, having seizures from also kicking 15mg of Xanax a day as well at the same time. I got so bad that the Jail literally ended up taking me to the hospital because my body physically couldn‚Äôt handle detoxing off a ball a day Heroin habit and a huge benzo habit at the same time and the Doctor ended up literally writing for the Jail to require to give me Suboxone 3x daily in Jail, I was shocked. But it saved my life. I had no intention of quitting I just wanted the quickest way out of jail at the time. 

I‚Äôm going to sum this up because it‚Äôs a lengthy story but I ended up getting extradited back to WA state, facing 8 felonies. I luckily took the best deal I could and plead to 3 of them for 6 months ran concurrent to drop the rest, which were 36 months I was facing. I ended up in work release, got a job, and this is about 2 months clean now, still just trying to get through it so I can go back to my thing. 

But something happened. I started getting happy. At the littlest things. Seeing my family (who is also HUGE in recovery, they run our local ALANO club) tell me they were proud of me. Clocking in at a job. Coming back and knowing I was gonna pass my UA everyday I left for work release and came back. I got happy. And I knew I was gonna die if I went back out. 

After 8 OD‚Äôs, 3 month hospital stays from sepsis while having Heroin brought to me at the hospital so I could shoot it into my pick line that went to my heart, I knew I would die. I don‚Äôt know how I even made it to be honest all I know is I‚Äôm grateful beyond measure. 
So I finished my time, started getting into the program, which I‚Äôve been around my entire life because of my parents, got a sponsor who is now the biggest role model in my life today, and my best friend. Fast forward a year, today, I haven‚Äôt used since the moment I was arrested a year ago.

I actively participate in my life with my family, who trusts me again? What? ITS CRAZY! I met the absolute love of my life (who‚Äôs a normie) so that‚Äôs been its own beautiful journey, we live in our own home together that I GET to pay the rest for each month, and We are expecting our first child, our daughter, in February. 

I was terrified to post this but that‚Äôs the whole process of becoming a better me, coming out of my comfort zone, not being afraid or judged for what I write or post. I FUCKING DID IT, And I‚Äôm proud. I‚Äôm blessed, but most of all I‚Äôm grateful. I went from puking on myself in a jail cell having seizures, thinking my life was over and I was ready to die, to waking up every morning, with the person I love most in this world next to me and our daughter in her tummy, not worrying about being sick, actively trying to better myself constantly. And I still have flaws, plenty of them. I think the biggest misconception when I got clean was the whole ‚Äúonce you get clean your life will be better‚Äù and I was confused why that wasn‚Äôt happening, why this magical sober fairy wasn‚Äôt making my life better. And that‚Äôs when I realized, nothing changes if nothing changes. Getting clean is the backbone, the foundation, but learning how to live again is it‚Äôs own completely separate thing. And I live again today. 

November 1st, 2018. The worst day of my life, but the day i will forever carry as the day that my life changed forever. This took me days to get the courage to post but I‚Äôm happy i out my anxiety aside and did it. Stories like these, they can truly help people. I‚Äôve read similar stories that gave me even just the thought of ‚Äúmaybe I should get clean?‚Äù So if this teaches 1,000 people or reaches none, that‚Äôs okay.

My girlfriend and I have been using since July (pressed 30s) after 5 years of sobriety. It‚Äôs been absolutely terrible. Never thought we would be back here but we are. It started with one bowl of weed .... then one beer.... then drinking weekly...... then daily.... then I tried Kratom to quit drinking ..... that led to daily Kratom use.... which ultimately led to me snorting a bump off one of those 30s and we were off to the races. 

We have been trying to figure out a way to get clean for so long now as we have 3 dogs and we both work full time. It was so hard to figure this out. Both of our insurance didnt cover mental health shit so we had to apply for new insurance .... so mine worked and I got State Insurance but my girlfriend makes too much money to get state so she was just completely fucked. 

So we called around all our friends who had treatment connections ... as I said we were sober working the program for 5 years .... and we called like 15 people until finally one of them got her a scholarship!!! To a detox 5 hours away. But we said fuck it and I dropped her off today. So she will be in there for a week while I watch our dogs... then when she gets out thats when I will go in. Crazy I know ... but we are making it work !! I am so determined to get our life back. Its been a crazy ride guys. Im very grateful for this thread I feel like this story needed to be shared in here. 

So about detox .... does anyone have any tips for me ? I am NOT gonna ask for subs I just want to nip this in the butt and come out clean. My friend told me to go the Librium/Gaba/Clonodine route ... as the Librium knocks you out for like 3-4 days and gets you through the worst of it. Has anyone in here had that experience ? Ive heard it works wonders. I have only kicked cold turkey in a rehab before and it was terrrrrible. No comfort meds at all. So this whole benzo/gaba/clonodine cocktail sounds kind of nice. Anywho... wish us luck !! This is a huge step in the right direction for us. And again - any feedback about detox experience would be so helpful. I know sub taper will help some but since Ive been doing Fent I really dont want to fuck around with the Pwd.... do you guys think I am approaching this the right way ? Let me know.

&#x200B;

Recently, my close friend's wife decided to leave him. It caused a huge rift in our social circle, and it doesn't seem like he has a lot of people other than myself that he can turn to. On the surface he seems to be doing well, but I worry that he's just trying to bury his emotions. He's a great guy but doesn't usually show a lot of emotional stability (anxiety, depression) in difficult situations.

&#x200B;

Anyways, my pal used to be an opioid addict for years. A few weeks ago, I remember him recalling how awesome it felt while we were on a road trip, it was a pretty weirdly placed comment at the time. The last few times we were chatting via text his messages appeared sort of drunk, but he has dyslexia and it happens. To make things extra complicated, I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed BPD and will deny any wrongdoing until he is blue in the face (I'm aware of how people with this condition behave and maintain strong boundaries with this dude).

&#x200B;

Anyways, I've had experience with lots of friends who were stim addicts because it was popular in my old city. I've never met anyone with opioid problems though. For you guys I have 2 questions:

\- As former addicts, what would have been the most appropriate way for a friend to reach out to you when you needed help?",3,0

Started off as most conversations I‚Äôve had with others in the same situation, he said he was doing great and was really happy. We start to shoot the shit and catch up a bit and he tells me he had actually used the night before and then asked me if I had insurance (que red flags)

So I tell him I do, wondering why he‚Äôs asking about my insurance and he says he didn‚Äôt really go to get off heroin, he only went because he met someone who would pay him $1600 if he stayed at least two weeks at some rehab in California.

I don‚Äôt know what to do but I‚Äôm very mad that this is being exploited like this.

This is one of the few things I‚Äôve gotten mad over recently, i don‚Äôt get mad if an old plug randomly hits me up because I never told them I quit but now there‚Äôs a company who‚Äôs making money by offering me compensation to relapse?

I'm surprised that I haven't had any cravings but at the same time I knew I'd be fine without them. My partner was addicted to oxy way before we met and then about 1 year into our relationship I picked up the oxy addiction. I've been an addict for about 2 years. My partner left me purely because his mental health and addiction was getting out of hand and he felt like he was drowning under water and basically spontaneously left me, but more so left his life to try and get clean.  It's comforting to know I'm not the reason he left, he left because he knew he couldn't get clean in this house. We would get oxy every Wednesday and they'd only last 2 days.  So the sober days were the hardest for him because he didn't have suboxone like I did to take away the withdrawals, which meant he couldn't even get out of bed to get to work and rent arrears were piling up because of that. I do really want the best for him but it does hurt that he didn't tell me how bad he was struggling because for months now I had been telling him that I don't wanna get oxy on wednesday because I feel fine without it, but when I would see him there suffering and his job being on the line because of it, I felt like I had no choice but to get him some oxy just so he would go to work (it was hard because when he was fiending I would cave in, and vice versa).  We've been separated since the 5th of November. I found out on the night he left that he stole his mums oxy that she had from a surgery she went through last year. I couldn't imagine how hurt his mum was when he did that but it's a good thing because now she will see how bad his addiction is and really help get him through it. She now recieves his paycheck from work so he doesn't have money to go and buy oxy, and his car has also been taken off him to really cancel any way of getting oxy. I think that is all great because I do just want him to be happy and healthy and sober! When the break up happened I did question myself, I was like, ""why the fuck should I be sober right now I don't have anything to prove and I don't give a shit about life right now"". But my best friend has helped me keep my head up high, she has watched me get oxy and sell every single tab just to get money to help with moving and she couldn't be more proud. If I was going to slip up it would have been during all this heartache and trauma and also having oxy at arms length. It feels good to prove to everyone that I am and always have been honest when it comes to my drug use because man, when people accuse me of lying because I'm an addict I actually lose my shit because it's so disheartening to hear. But thankfully I am strong, even at times I feel weak, I am still strong because I have been taking my suboxone every day like I should and don't suffer any withdrawals or cravings and it's honestly the best. I can't wait to prove it to my partner as we are still best friends. I just want to celebrate our clean time together and to see something so good come out of this break up after being together for 3.2 years, I just feel like we spent so much time together let's not forget that, and let's looks at this next step as getting on our feet and getting our individual lives back so we can get back together in the future, if that happens. Which I believe it will because we have the smallest friend circle, which would be impossible to not be atleast friends. But yea, I just wanted to share my story and how long I've been clean for! 11 days!",3,0

Tried methadone, tried suboxone. Methadone wasn‚Äôt too bad but kept getting super tired during the day and my fast metabolism would cause me to feel minor withdrawals from methadone by the time 20 hours passed from previous dose of around 80 MG(had a super high tolerance to opiates/opioids) anyways, my main concern. Getting clean. Now I‚Äôve done ALOT of research and reading articles, etc. I can‚Äôt take Kratom it makes me gag and throw up , tried pills and tea method, suboxone seems to make me feel weird and shitty even after taking 24 hours after last use of H. So when it comes to kicking dope the 2 biggest issues with staying clean is A. The chills/hot flashes & B. RLS, restlessness in general. I can deal with the liquid poop(sorry) achey muscles, runny nose/watery eyes, but the chills are so strong and with the sweaty/clamminess it makes me to just want to bundle up and not move. Making my withdrawals worse because I‚Äôm not even willing to take a shower because that means I have to get out of my clothes which means I‚Äôll be cold. Maybe I‚Äôm just being a big whiny little idiot and need to man the f up and deal with the withdrawals like a man.

I know for me in the past at least, the holidays can be rough. But we have to stay strong and push through it. Possibly seeing family sober for the first time, being lonely throughout the holidays, being broke. We just have to realize these are normal things that even people who aren‚Äôt in recovery have to deal with. We just have to learn to deal with it differently then they do, without drugs!

It‚Äôs been a rough journey to get here. I even stopped talking to my childhood friend because he decided to not get sober when I did, rough decision, but you have to focus on yourself and not let anybody get in the way.

And I can't even fall back on opiates anymore.,"I'm in my late 30's and for probably a good 15 years I initially cruised along with a pretty minor codeine addiction. Then in my early 30's I started needing more and more. Then our nation OTC codeine ban came I to effect. Then the doctor shopping started. And then my ultimate downfall. I'm an RN. I got a job in palliative care. This is basically unlimited access. When a patient dies and the medication is discarded there is no monitoring, no documentation. Up until then the strongest I'd ever doses was 200mg codeine/15mg of oxy at a time. In the past year I've used anything I could get my hands on. Oxy, morph, diluadid, tramadol, fentanyl, bupe. 2 months ago I IV'd for the first time. My tolerance was insane. 10mg IV diluadid at a time. 20mg IV morph. More than twice a day. They called me out on my distant and weird behavior 3 weeks ago. I quit CT that weekend and haven't used since. It was awful. No one knows or knew. I'm married, I have a toddler. Withdrawal was hell but I did it. Quietly with little fuss. I've been fighting to reclaim my sanity and try my absolute hardest but they just called me in and fired me. And rightly so. I've never had a complaint from a patient but I was unengaged and fucked up plenty in other ways. 

I want to use. Badly. And I can't. I honestly think if I knew how to score H I would right now. But this situation is bad enough. I can't lose my family. I don't know why I'm dumping this but you're the first people I've admitted it to. Now I have to go home and tell my husband I lost my job.

It's been a tough year for me. In early 2019, I got clean for 40\~ days from a 200mg+/day oxy habit. This habit has been off and on for over 10 years now.

I've been in this sick cycle of getting clean and then going back to using. I've never switched to needles, only because I've always been in a good financial state to afford pills. At the longest, I had over a year of clean time under my belt and also another 6 month stint of clean time. I've also had multiple 4-6 month stints where I was only using Kratom.

Anyways, after my 40+ days clean this year, I started back on oxy for about a month. I quickly realized that this couldn't go on any longer, and I switched to Kratom for a few months. However, I found tapering off of Kratom to be a lot harder (mentally) than Oxy.

Fast forward to October - I relapsed onto Oxy for another month, and quit about 7 days ago. I've been clean for almost 8 days now, and the recovery process has been much harder than it's ever been. I'm both mentally and physically drained. Every morning when I wake up, my brain feels like it's fragmented. Like I can literally feel the different parts of my brain are jumbled up. I can't pull myself up to do something until lunch time. This, coming from someone who runs his own company and used to do two-a-days at the gym between a 9-10 hour work day.

I've been taking care of myself over the past week, taking all the essential vitamins and going back to my keto diet to minimize GI discomfort. I'm also lucky in that I've been able to be 100% truthful with my fiance, who's been super supportive. However, she still asks 'when will your sleep get back to normal?' and 'when will you feel like having sex again?'. Answers I really don't know how to answer. All I can say is, 'soon'.

In the past, after the 7 day mark, I'm usually feeling pretty good. But this time around, I feel like a shell of myself. The only thing I can think of is that I also got myself addicted to certain ingredients in Kratom that have had a long lasting effect on things mentally. It's particularly agonizing, because I recall getting back to some resemblance of 'normal' after getting clean for 40+ days earlier this year. 

Looking for any possible guidance. Thanks.",1,0

I committed crimes to pay for my addiction and eventually was caught and became incarcerated for 7 years - it was while I was in there I found sobriety as well as my future fiance. I woke up and decided enough was enough - since then I've been clean and it will be 2 years this July. Life is better now though I still have my moments and cravings. I started a blog with my fiance (who is also a recovering addict) who felt that it would be a good outlet to post weekly her journey through recovery.

I realised the only way it was gonna work for me was to do a slow taper. The first parts of the taper were easy, but it got harder and harder. Getting down to 1mg was a struggle. But I finally stabilised on 1mg, to the point where I forgot to take a dose. 

So now it's time to really plan my taper, going down to 0.125mg before I jump. 

Today is my first day on 0.75mg. I created a spreadsheet to plan and track the taper. I have four 8mg films to use for this taper, which I worked out would be plenty, but I can always get more. 

I got a pill organiser to store my daily doses. It's only a 7 day one, but I can store excess slices in another container.

I took one film, cut it into eight 1mg slices, then cut all of those into 0.5mg slices. I put a 0.5mg slice into each slot of the pill organiser, then I cut some 0.5mg slices into 0.25mg slices to add to each slot, to make 0.75mg total.

So now I have 0.75mg doses ready for the next 7 days.

Cutting them up real small, and not losing any, is a challenge, but a great source on this sub taught me that the cutting doesn't need to be precise, so that helps.

If I do 10 days on 0.75mg, 16 days on 0.5mg, 32 days on 0.25mg, then 64 days on 0.125mg, I'll be done by March 2020. 

I can handle 4 months more of this, if it's finally over once it's done.

The taper plan will probably change with trial and error, and I may not need 2 months of 125 micrograms, but at least I have a spreadsheet and some kind of plan.",2,0

He has been clean since 4 days ago since that was the last day he had taken a quarter of his 2 mg dose.

He asked for a scheduled taper via his psychiatrist but is very firm on not wanting to substitute one drug for another. I feel like this entire process would be easier on him if he didn‚Äôt have restless leg syndrome. For the past 2 nights his arms and legs have been involuntarily kicking/jerking which has made him (and unfortunately me) mentally exhausted. Sitting in a warm bath this morning has helped alleviate his muscles but I can‚Äôt expect him to sit in the bath all night just to sleep. I‚Äôm incredibly thankful that the symptoms are minor (no vomiting, no problems eating, or using the bathroom).

Is there anyone who can suggest natural home remedies other than sitting in the bath/exercising (which he has been doing) or anything that would help his restless leg syndrome slow down so he is able to get more sleep?

Was taking little tiny bumps as my dose after tapering, but when they gave me suboxone after a day of waiting, I went into the worst WD I've ever had. They kept giving me suboxone (4mg 3 times a day) and it kept me in WD for 2 straight days with nothing getting better. I'm talking like 10/10 WD and the worst pain of my life for such a long time 

3rd day got better. They changed me to Subutex. Not sure if it was because the precipitated WD were mostly over or if it was the subutex and lack of naloxone. Every time I've ever taken suboxone, it has put me into WD. Tried to look into it and could not fin ANY useful info aside from the fact that naloxone hypersensitivity exists... Also another person told me they had the same issue with h/ fent and suboxone and after waiting 3 days and being in horrible WD the suboxone still made things worse.

Can ANYONE please tell me what's going on here. I want to use subutex to detox, but I'm afraid of whether the same thing will happen or not and if it is simply naloxone sensitivity and subutex will work well instead of suboxone. 

Also could it just be the way fentanyl reacts with any kind of sub? I heard it has a very strange way of lingering in some peoples' systems for a long tim, but I'm not sure. Please help me out with this. I really really want to be done with all this for good once I fix my back",2,0

Thats not what I'm saying at all. I clarified in my comment below.

Hey guys-- hope all is well with everyone. I'm about 35 days ""clean"". I say that with quotes cause I've been on methadone for 1 year, but I just recently quit using fentanyl on top of my dose.

Overall, I feel like I've been making ok progress in turning my life around. I'm budgeting, saving and investing to try to get my finances back in control. I'm working out. Other than that idk if I'm doing much to change my habits. 

My question/concern is this: I've been smoking weed every night for the past 2 weeks or so. Part of me thinks ""it's just weed. Who cares?"" But part of me also thinks this might be an issue cause it seems like it's kinda turning into an addictive behavior. For example, I feel like I should take a break and not do it EVERY night, but I haven't managed to take that break yet  I wanted to ask you guys what your thoughts on this are. Has anyone had a similar experience? Am I fooling myself thinking that I'm getting ""clean"" and establishing better habits but smoking weed nightly at the same time? Does anyone feel that pot would get in the way of working on yourself? Idk... it doesnt have the same numbing effect as dope does. Matter of fact, it makes me think more about my problems and emotions sometimes. 

I know this might sound dumb to people reading, but I just need someone else's opinion on this. Should I just be easy on myself since I'm still really early into recovery?

Before and after my last dose 2 dramatic life events happened which caused insane anger towards my life and as a person. I used that anger to my ''advantage'' and stopped Suboxone.


I've been doing codeine everyday since then. It's sort of a replacement therapy for me which keeps the Suboxone WDs away. I've been also using Klonopin and some dissociatives from time to time.


I don't know if this could be considered a big victory but everything's been much better without Suboxone. I know other drug use like benzos is dangerous and cause another habit but it has helped so much. I'm trying to be careful with this kind of use.

So, I have done a fucking shitty thing, I live in Brazil, and here we just dont have opiates on the streets, we dont have heroin, I have used H one time after days and days searching te right guy, and i bought just to feel the rush, logically that sit was cut with some nasty things, but it was unique, just the rush. Just to you know the context, the street dealears have brick weed, coke and crack.

So the doctors, the clinics, the psychiatrists, the psychologists simply doesnt know how to deal with opiate addiction.

My history its based on always make a way to get high with any substance, but opiates simply steal my soul forever, I am a borderline pacient, my family has history of menthal diseases, and addiction, my father is a drunk addicted, and coke and ketamine addicted, this is what I know, I started my addiction (I already smoke weed everyday, this on my 16', and I used a bunch of psychedelics and RC's, ketamine, coke, crack, mdma, etc etc) when I found various boxes of codeine on my fathers rooms, he and my mom were always fighting, and they spend 5 yrs without talking to each other, they slept on different rooms, so I found it, with tramadol, klonopins, valiums. In my mind I would took that boxes and took opiates with benzos to commit suicide (various reasons), in that time I just couldnnt hang it anymore, but first I tried codeine, and 1 hour later I was on heaven, so I discovered the world of pharms, Brazil is very limited in pharms too, we dont have the best opiate, and the best benzo, and the best amph, shitty country, but we have little pharms, not the big brand names pharms, and some of them, if you know the owner, sell any product, ANY, without recipe, for a bigger price, but its ok. This is how I got my shit when I though ""well my tolerance is going to get high, he is gonna suspect"", in that phase I was on oxy, orally, I think I had 18', and taking 80mg with any potentiator I found, and fuck if it worked or not. I was selling in university and getting money to buy my stuff, but I realized that I couldnt pay oxy anymore, so I changed to morphine pillls, I was in love more than before, I was using osy, because everybody says ""morphine orally is shit"", but for me morph>oxy (oral), and it was way more cheaper, started using morph orally, yes orally, but someday I couldnt pay for it anymore, so I had 2 options plug or IV pills (we dont have miccron filters to buy in here, fuck, we dont even have narcan), so started to plug, in the begging it was a mess, but I got how to do it right, and again the history repeats, in my 20' I know a guy in here, he lives in Brazil too, in the same state, but different cities, but he cames a lot to sp (where I live), and he was a pro in Iving morph, he could catch any vein, it was beautiful hahahahaha so I saw he injecting, tried in myself, see the dark red blood in the syringe and bang it, ops, with ig quality coke, o shit man, pins and needles all over my body,we cant really explain what we fell on the rush, I was a god, I felt like life is beautiful, I can handle life.

And then my life turned over, I always chasing the dragon, before I always dosed 1 time a day, I started to do it 3, 4 times a day, 120mg, 150mg, 180mg, nothing was more important than morphine, when my contact couldnt get it, I bough methadone, and used to stay fine, I was abusing benzos as well, I liked rophynol with my highs, and coke, I was a speedball addicted, my life was getting high, my notes on university got down, reproved many things, I didnt care, I was not studying, in class I was nodding and going to te bathroom, u know why. And one day in home with my mother and my aunt I OD, took soo much soma, with rophynol, xanax, midazolam IV, 800mg of morph a day was my tolerance, I yhink I got higher, I didnt had to take the motherfucking soma, it gave me a wrong vibe, and I pass out. Wake up in a hospital bed, under OBSERVATION, they didnt used narcan, I though it has to exist at least in hospitals, right? or fucking naltrexone, anything. If I was gonna die, I would die, my mom saw all my drug stashes, and it was complete, I had replaced that day, morphine, oxys, rophynol, kloopins, prometh, weed, tobacco, cocaine, crack, soma, xanax, methadone, syringes, spoons, needles, everything, I was so crazy when I got home that I forget to hide it inside the PC.

So, I had the worst experience someone could hsve in this ospital, they really didnt know what they are doing, they said it was te first case of opioid abuse, it was hell for 30 days, and then I got to a clinic, who too didnt know what they are doing, I got off te hospital wit 60mg of done, didnt help, I speak to the doctor, I imagine I know more than who, and the I got up to 100mg of dones. Nobody wants to up my dose more, I went on 15 doctors, and I give up, now I go on a doctor who pass what I want basically, the doctor kept my meds, and he is giving me a manutention, which the others wanted to took of my dones. I should take 100mg of dones, 600mg of pregabalin, 5mg of kpins, 200mg of sertraline and 100mg of topiramate. But a hour has come, my cravings were so strong, that I started to abuse my meds, I started to take 180mg-200mg of dones between 36-48 hours, if I felt sick, I take 0,1mg of clonidine, up my dose of kpins to 12mg or more it do the work, just to feel the relief and the good high when I take it, together with 2g of pregabalin, I dose kpins every now and then, but I start with 4mg, and sometimes dramamine, cyclobenzaprine, and obviously cocaine, still using everyday, I need that to get out of bed, and during the high. I still smokes cigarettes and weed, but less than before, I reallly dont know what to do,

I dont know what to do if they started to down my dose, and I dont wanna to stop because my life continues the same shit, and its the moment I feel good, Can I taper that? can I just got back taking 100mg every 24hr? Cold turkey is out of the question, I need some help.",3,0

My story.","For the last 3 years I've been in, what I thought was a great relationship. I absolutely loved him, we lived together have 2 cats and a dog. I thought we were doing really well. My partner has been addicted to Oxycodone before we met and unfortunately I developed an addiction to oxy aswell and we've been struggling with our addiction ever since. At first I thought his problem was that he was paying all the bills and buying the oxy and then having to share them with me because he would go on about how it sucks he has to share his drugs and then is left with none for days purely because we have no money left. So basically I hustled my ass off and ended up making deals to the point we weren't even paying for our drug of choice anymore so I thought everything was fine and that there shouldn't be a problem anymore.  My partner is also a heavy weed smoker and has depression and anxiety along with me, except I don't smoke weed anymore. My partners addiction got to the point where he wouldn't go to work without his drugs, and when he had drugs he was happy as. He works Monday to Friday but every Monday he would stay home from work because he was in severe withdrawals so basically the only reason I kept getting the oxy was because I didn't want him to get fired from his job all because of drugs. I just wanted the best for him and at the time I thought that was the best thing I could do because I didn't know any better and he never tried to talk to me about his addiction or if he wanted to get clean. Because man, if I knew he wanted to get clean I would not have supplied him drugs every week. I know you're probably thinking, ""yeah right you're an addict you can't have that control"" but it's true because I'm currently on the suboxone program which takes away withdrawals and cravings and until this post it's the first time I've thought about the drug. I have even gotten the drugs, but to sell all of them because I'm desperate for the money so I don't lose my home from missing rent payments.  So I'm proud of myself for having the willpower to not do the drugs but instead sell them to actually help me. God this must be hard to read.  I'm sorry my heads all over the show. Basically last Tuesday my partner left me out of the blue with no explanation and I'm so confused. He said that we aren't good for each other and if that's a reference to drugs then I'm even more annoyed because he never gave me a chance to have a convo about it. Like right now I'm doing so well and I just wanna prove that to him. Atm he's staying at his parents and that's going to be extremely hard for him, because he doesn't have a car atm and he will be in withdrawals and his mum will really be watching his every move. I do wanna tell his mum that sending my partner to his best friends house who is also an addict is the wrong thing for him but I don't want him to hate me for meddling. Basically I just need some advice. I really want to get back together because us together means more than drugs and I just want that chance to prove it to him. I also don't wanna do something that might make him angry and not wanna get back together. I know he's having a hard time right now but why did he have to do it this way, why couldn't he talk to me? We have been together for 3 years and man we are best friends we love doing everything together we were inseparable. This is the longest we've gone without speaking to one another and I'm scared that the more time we spend apart the more he will realise he doesn't wanna be with me, but at the same time I'm too scared to talk about it now with him in case it's still to early and doesn't work in my favour. Has anyone else been in a long term relationship where drugs were involved? Please share your stories or maybe share some insight to help me.",1,0

In the beginning, was going to take myself out, told no one. Reached out to r/opiates for help \[not knowing it was an active drug forum\] only to be greeted with an extended arm and a smile, to accompany words of encouragement. I felt so void of originality, conversation, emotion, destitute to remain socially-unequipped. I just wanted to die, faked being happy to be polite, and still do \[not so much, the death part, anymore\] Now, I actually feel purpose coming back to me, as if to say it's physically tangible. I still feel like I'm dying, just slightly less intensely. I remind myself I stand where I stand today, as a result of my choices. WD from opiates will give you a pungent sense of impending doom, physical sensations that reflect the abuse of a certain narcotic currently plaguing a large percentage of the U.S. population, and if I go back, I'm just feeding that statistic. I'm actually glad I'm going through this though. I actually feel what I'm typing, as I type it, and it makes my throat tight with emotion, whereas before, was just a vessel, a medium for consciousness to exist no thought/feelings/expressions. The more distance between me and that last Oxy, the more concrete, my desire to stay clean becomes. I'm still freeze-sweating, just not as profusely, nor as hopelessly. I thought I had permanently changed myself for the worse, but that's just how it feels in the moment that it happens to you. The moment you begin to feel the progress, I promise it will be worth the time. Complacency kills, on that note, I shall remain vigilant in my recovery, using the resources myself and my family have so generously provided me, without question. I can say that I love myself today, though I may have made some terrible, irreparable mistakes. Thank God for another day alive, thank you Reddit, for the reception and the encouragement.

183,2019-11-09 02:56:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/dtt2tz/detoxing_at_home/,Detoxing At Home,"So, my brother who is 25, has been addicted to Heroin for a couple years now and from when he started using to now, he's been to rehab 3 or 4 different times. The longest he's been off of heroin was probably 2 or 3 months, but I think he was still taking pills for social anxiety and I think he also got a vivitrol shot too. I don't count that as being completely clean, although i know it's better than him being on heroin. 

Anyways, he still lives with me and my parents. My parents have been pretty lenient with dealing with his addiction and have not really  been as serious as they should have been with him getting clean. They've yelled at him and sent him to rehabs, but he would always end up signing himself out after a week or 2 which i know isn't enough time. When I first found out he was on heroin a couple yrs ago, It was hard to believe and very emotional and all of that, but i don't want to get into all of that. I'm sure you guys already know how it is. 

The point is, he's gotten to a point now where he no longer has insurance and my parents can't afford to pay for a rehab. But, we did end up finding a state funded detox center that he could stay in for 7-10 days just to get through the withdrawals and when he comes home, we'll take the necessary steps to help him to recover mentally and physically instead of just letting him isolate himself in his room and just assume that he was gonna make up his mind and decide to be clean forever. So, he went to that detox center yesterday and today he called my mom complaining about them not giving him medication/pills for the withdrawals. I don't know if that's true or not but it's possible that they didn't give him any medication because it is a FREE detox center. But regardless, I figured that he just wants to come home to figure out a way to get heroin. 

On the phone, he said he was going to get clean this time and all of that typical shit. Not sure if he's really serious or not. My mom asked him how is coming home gonna be any different and he said he has xanax and buprenorphine to help with the withdrawals. So, I know how bad Xanax is in general and i know buprenorphine helps with withdrawals but he can also get addicted to that and also go through precipated withdrawals which are a lot worse and will make him want heroin even more. I read online that he can use xanax to detox , but once he detoxes, he'll have to taper off of it so he doesn't get addicted to that. I have his pills so i can control how much he takes. I know this should be done under medical supervision, but we won't be able to get to a doctor until Monday so, should I give him the xanax whenever he needs it? Or should i give him the buprenorphine? I know that he's gonna shake sometimes too and he has a pill for that too. But i feel like if he's on one pill for anxiety/insomnia (xanax) and another pill for cravings (buprenorphine) and another one for tremors/seizures, aren't all these pills interacting gonna be bad for him or not? That's why I wanna know if I can just give him only the Xanax while he detoxes which might take a week or so and then have him taper off of that and then focus on recovery. Also, is heroin withdrawal deadly without medication?",1,0

I was then like, ""holy fuck, YES PLEASE.""  The thought that this REALLY CAN BE THE **LAST** TIME was extremely motivating and encouraging.

Things were still tough.  I still had a long row of Suboxone therapy to hoe, but that moment was it.  It was when I finally had enough and decided, never again.

It was pretty miraculous as I was craving strongly earlier in the day and had a runny nose, intense sneezing, shakes, weird neck cramps(which have been the strangest thing about this time), and pretty severe depression. Now I had some good kratom and crappy headshop kratom, honestly my initial impression of the headshop kratom was sooo bad that I didn‚Äôt even touch it again after an initial dose of 7 grams, so the bottle sat up there for awhile. The confusion is about how the symptoms just lifted, I‚Äôm use to withdrawal lasting at least 5 days, but after taking what I considered the crappy headshop kratom I felt better, than taking the good kratom that I ran out of. The good kratom would only mask the withdrawal, but I could tell it was there if that makes sense.

Hit the sauna (if you have access)
Have an abundance of clean clothes
Drink plenty of water, tea, etc (coffee will make you dehydrated but if it makes you feel better why not it is better than pills)
Take as many showers as you need to
Have clean sheets to lay down in
Take a walk if you can even if it is for 5 minutes
Have Netflix or any streaming service ready (I am a Seinfeld and curb fanatic and it will make me laugh even after watching it 100 times)

This has all been a pyramid I had would have to climb when I realized how many fucking levels of trickery my want built above me.

The first and top stone was me convincing myself I needed them to get through work. 6 years later, knowing it was all killing me, I could still justify using, building many other levels on that pyramid. The fucking tower I have to climb to face each one of those mental levels of fuckery I put myself through, it seems pretty fucking intimidating.

Three and a half months compared to six years? Yeah, when the first month passed and I had that day when I woke up and felt 'normal' and thought, welp - that was easy.

Not even fucking close to finished with this war. I'm still on that first level, and I can go back to building more levels I'll have to climb later, or I can face whatever is at the top when I finally finish climbing and try to take my life back.

I try to keep it uplifting in these posts but today I'd be faking it. PAWS is a fucking bitch. I wish I didn't shrug off PAWS, thinking I had won the war, when it was only just a battle. I'm guessing I have another 3 months of this bullshit. Le sigh.

My advice today - PAWS is just as hard to get through as the first weeks. Don't let it break you.",19,0

I had a roughly 2 year opiate habit, starting on 30-50 mg Norco per day and gradually increasing to dosing up to 100mg multiple times per day, with the occasional oxycodone sprinkled into the mix when I could find it. After realizing the error of my ways and the future that this habit held, and also realizing that if 100mg of hydro at once wasn't even doing the trick anymore, I ""quit"" by method of the ""wondrous and not harmful at all"" plant, kratom. 2 years of excessive kratom use later, I was forced off the stuff by way of a 6 month backpacking trip to South America. My two-week supply of kratom that I brought with me ran out in about one week (surprise!). After that I toughed out the uncomfortable withdrawals with a bit more ease than I thought. Although throughout the ensuing 4 months my life as a backpacker grew more and more debauched... My previous habit of heavy drinking returned, leading me to suspect that kratom played a huge role in curbing cravings to drink. Also, with the cheap and plentiful plethora of drugs available to me in South America, I began a phase of the heaviest cocaine use I've experienced in my life so far. Almost every night, one drink led to five, which led to a bag of coke or sometimes MDMA, which led to heroic levels of alcohol use. My cigarette habit, cold turkey for almost one year, back with a vengeance. So, well and good, off the opiates, finally off kratom... Traded for just about all the other shitty party habits one could imagine. Much more self destructive than kratom, and I've had many thoughts of just getting back on the K when I return home, to re-stabilize my behavior and cut the insane death wish - style partying out. It's worked in the past. Well, 4 months after the cessation of kratom, I encountered a pharmacy in Colombia. Tramadol, cheap as could be. What the hell, right? Couple days of that stupid half assed high and I'm back at the pharmacy inquiring about hydrocodone. Yes, they have that. Cool. Day or two of that, and it's ""oxycodone""? Sure thing, come by tomorrow. After this I spent two weeks in an opiated haze, consuming about 100-120 mg of oxy every morning and throwing in a couple Norco for the hell of it. Then nighttime would arrive and it would be back on the party drugs, and benzos in the wee hours to force a chemical induced sleep. Every new drug I ingested I wondered if this would be the combo that killed me. It was fucked. I escaped the city I was in as soon as I realized how deep I was in. I'm now at an isolated spot in the jungle, purposely having brought no opiates with me,  having realized I slipped right back into my old tolerance, my old dependence, after just 2 weeks. Apart from kicking the shit out of myself for having been stupid enough to consider purchasing that demonic substance again, now I am 3 days off of all that and, being far from any major civilization, a bit bored. But the point of this story is that now I'm experiencing, just as intense as ever, the craving. The fantasizing. ""wouldn't this be so much better if you were a couple oxy 40's in?"" I fucking hate these thoughts and couldn't have imagined how quickly they would creep back into my mind after years of not using true opiates. The slope was more slippery than I ever could have imagined. So, for lack of a better question, what the FUCK do I do now? -an open question to the world of Reddit.",48,0

They randomized opioid dependent people to either extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) or suboxone (BP-NLX). A high quality study with some interesting findings. 

They looked at measures of insomnia, anxiety and depression during a 12 week clinical trial and then an open 36 week follow up. Only the insomnia scores were statistically worse for the XR-NTX group in the early 12 week period and insomnia scores seemed to normalize in the 36 week follow up period. They did not detect differences in depression and anxiety. 

I was on Suboxone for 2 years and recently quit about 60 days ago. Suboxone did save my life and stabilize me. However, I felt like I was in withdrawal before my dose every day, my love of music had stopped, I didn‚Äôt really feel pleasure anymore. I felt like 80% of a person - which isn‚Äôt a bad trade off if the option is overdose and death.  This study makes me wonder if I didn‚Äôt give Naltrexone a fair chance? It looks like it could be tougher than Suboxone for the first 3-6 months, but then the differences may not be as great?

I would be interested to hear feedback from people that have been on Naltrexone, Vivitrol or Suboxone.

It was a case of either upping the dose, or getting off the ride, because they weren't helping the pain anymore (making it worse) and I realized I was simply taking them because of dependency.  So I stopped. 

The first week was the usual nasty.  The following 2 months were worse, in my opinion.  I waited to feel better.  But I don't.  I'm terribly anxious all the time.  I have no interest in anything.  I can't motivate myself at work.  I procrastinate.  I avoid people.  I'm sad.  I used to write, read, play games, watch tv shows and movies... I don't have the attention span to sit through an entire tv show now, and I haven't touched books or games since I quit.

Now I'm on the verge of losing my job, because I do just enough to avoid getting in trouble, but spend most of my time staring at the computer screen waiting to go home - while work piles up.  My wife suffers anxiety and depression.  My job is high-stress, and unstable.  My son has special medical needs that prevent my wife from working.  We're financially drowning.  I feel crushed under the weight of my responsibilities.

I tried Concerta, it helped me focus a bit at work, but ultimately just made me more anxious.  Tried anti-depressants before, but they just made me numb and less motivated.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like I'm just losing at everything.

I know the opiates just helped me avoid facing everything.  But at least I could.  Now I can't.  I've lost all courage and confidence.  And in 2+ months, I only slid further backwards.",3,0

Most recently it was poppy seed tea, and it got so bad I went on to subs and a rapid taper followed by a week of valium to kick it.

I've also been using phenibut daily for the last 2-3 months to deal with stress at university. For those unfamiliar with it, it's sorta similar to gabapentin and the WD is full of nightmare fuel anxiety. 

Today is day 7 since my last sub dose. And day 10 since I've had phenibut. My plan was to study all day, then go to my first shift back at work since I got treatment for my addiction.

All day the anxiety, restlessness and depression were building. I focused on my study, but the whole time I had these thoughts. Why don't you just go score? To take the edge off. Make the first shift back a little easier. 

I even started googling to see if it was too soon to relapse and restart WD.

Instead I focused myself on my study. I enjoy it, so I pushed through the thoughts until it was time to head to work and I would have no time to pick up anything.

The anxiety was there, like I knew it would be. But getting back into my old routine seemed to ease it. And before I knew it I felt good. For the first time in a long time, I felt normal and happy without drugs.

Now, Ive had 10 month clean, and after 5 or 6 month I was feeling FREE. No need to think to abstain from going to pharmacy for OTC stuff, no need to avoid dealer, no need to think always about that.

I relapsed due to some really bad condition (exceptionnally chipped on sub then had a hearth problem -unrelated to sub- so I continued sub bc I could not had any WD while having the hearth problem. Ive gone to a cardiologist, got examination, the problem is solved, but I was now hooked to subs. I managed to take 2mg each sub half life -32 to 36 hours-), I stopped and surprisingly Ive almost no WD, to the point Im able to resume normal life. Probably multi factorial explanation : used to be in WD, hooked only 2 weeks, took each 36h and only 2mg instead each 24h, I didn't go back to the ""I need opiate to feel normal"" thinking.

But more importantly : I still don't give a fuck to opiate. I can go outside without saying any ""yes"" to dealers, without wanting to take OTC shit. Im still feeling free.

I think obsession to craving, fear for future consequence and guilt for past trainwreck play a big role in the post detox craving phase : now I understand when people say ""you don't need that"" when they speak to try to help an addict.

Typing has been keeping me distracted and I'd like to share this story publicly.

 I'll try to jump right into it - I've been on various opiates daily for the last 4 months (after a small month long codeine issue when I was 18). At first it started out with tramadol, some vicodin and an occasional percocet, then I moved somewhere with MUCH easier access to opiates and expanded into a bunch of others up til the last 2 months, but found a cheap unlimited source of oxycodone and have stuck with only that since then. I went from 10mg doses to 20mg to 40mg and finally 40-50mg 2-3 times per day where I've been at for at least a couple weeks now. My initial justification was that I need to kill time out here where I am while I wait for a court settlement back home, but now I'd like to keep a clear and sober mind to deal with some other issues that have come up as well.

Yesterday I woke up and decided it was enough, and spent the next 24 hours 100% free of oxy. I did not feel nearly as bad as I expected I would. The physical stuff was mostly limited to some restlessness and chills/sweats which was at worst uncomfortable. There was this strange sensation of agitation that one could almost mistake for euphoria, and overall I was in a pretty good mood up until night time. At night, the clarity started coming back and I got hit by a major depressive wave. All the strange decisions I've made and situations I've been in over the last few months suddenly hit me and I broke down into tears for longer than I would like to admit. I got some clonidine (OTC here!) and took 1mg at a time which helped me sleep quite nicely. I woke up moderately distraught this morning. I had something in between nausea and stomach cramping which made it hard to pace around, which my restlessness was compelling me to do. I broke a 40mg pill into 8 pieces and took one along with 1.5mg clonidine, half a pill of diphenhydramine, 500 mg tylenol and 125mg naproxen. Felt pretty well until about 2 hours ago when a headache really started kicking in. I took another 5mg of the oxy and ordered some coffee, and it turned out that it was just a caffeine headache (I'm addicted to that too) since the restaurant I order my usual breakfast smoothie from forgot to add the espresso this morning.  

All in all, I feel pretty good. Not quite good enough to go to the gym (social anxiety is higher than normal and I'm still a bit bothered by lots of loud noises and bright lights) but I'm not nauseous, not sweating all over the place, and only mildly brain fogged. I believe 100mg+ of oxy per day is a somewhat large amount, so I'm wondering why this is so much easier than I thought it would be. Everything has been pretty easily manageable except for the depressive waves, and coming up to 48 hours I'm already starting to feel like my old sober self again. I've heard countless nightmare stories of dope sickness and I'm just not experiencing much of it. Is it a personal genetic thing, a dosage thing, a timeframe thing or what?

I'm fuckimg sick of being a slave to it now, and have now begun the stupidest cold turkey withdrawal ever.

I had loads of cocaine last night and this morning woke up with a completely stuffed nose (always happens - will NEVER do again). Feels awful. But in a weird way its helped me in that I can focus on that whilst the w/d symptoms fester underneath.

About 30 hours since my last dose, and pregabalin is probably helping a lot, but I feel pretty good all things considered. Nose completely blocked but the only w/d symptoms i've noticed so far is mild stomach cramps.

I've wondered about the house alone and just cried all day, determined to kick this habit for my amazing wife and son. Was close to telling my mum but she wouldn't understand and would worry too much. She lives 3 hours away.

I was born in 1990 and one commonality I have seen throughout my life, and have even been convinced of at times, is there is something wrong with me that needs fixing. Coming of age in the 90s meant that you had a high probability of being A.D.D. and needing medication. Why is it that there needs to be so many disorders that need fixing and multitudes of drugs that supposedly fix these issues? The answer is greed.

Just as though we are told not to be content with our clothes, cars, food, friends, education, and status they now tell us that there is something wrong with our minds or bodies that they only have the solution to. I know medicine serves a purpose antibiotics are fantastic and work wonders. It is, however, abnormal to feel sedate, happy, or pain free all the time. The body knows not day without night nor fulfillment without hunger. Out of greed our medical field has monetized mass diagnosis and drug sales.

I am so grateful everyday I wake up and can feel! I know that taking on new debt won't make me happy, drugs will not make me happy, and people won't make me happy. I am content with where I am today, but not complacent.

For the most part my life is pretty great, but I have days where I feel like I just got off of pills without the insane physical symptoms.  Days where I can't find any motivation, desire or positivity and spend the whole day on the couch- just like the first month. 

Luckily, these down days don't come that often but I wonder if they are related to my former opiate addiction.  

The good news is I know that getting high will not make me feel better and the down day will pass. I am far  and enough out that even when the first thought of pills comes, I love my new life to much to trade it for that fleeting and false sense of well being. If you are earlier in recovery, please don't let this scare you. Even a bad day clean and sober is 1000 times better than a day owned by opiates. r/women_in_recovery",8,0

I just took 1mg Suboxone so the physical symptoms aren't too bad but the extreme depression, cravings, anxiety, etc., always drive me to the braking point.  I want nothing more than to go pickup and get high.  Nothing seems enjoyable to me without dope anymore, it's so sad...  All anyone wants is to feel comfortable so that's what we strive for.  Each withdrawal seems to only get more difficult to go through and after 10+ years of using it's no walk in the park.

What do you all do to get through the first few days?  Do you force yourself to try and walk, just sit and kick on the couch, take numerous showers, smoke, bing Netflix?  I want to know your strategies!

It slowly chips away at you and you get tired of not feeling normal. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm getting real tired of the lingering issues (I‚Äôm at 42 days no oxys, 19 days no subs). I wake up every morning at 5am no matter when I went to bed. I sleep, but it‚Äôs no longer than 4-6 hours. Which then just feeds in to the lethargy and feeling of hopelessness because I‚Äôm not getting enough rest. I am exhausted, but just awake enough to get no solace. It‚Äôs like a cruel game. Anyway, I‚Äôm just venting. I‚Äôm still not going to use and I don‚Äôt want to use any Xanax to temporarily remedy the issue. I‚Äôll start to want the xanz just to feel high if I start taking it a lot, I know myself. It hasn‚Äôt even been a month off everything, so I guess I can‚Äôt complain too much. I was on opiates for 6-7 years (subs on and off), so I guess I can‚Äôt be mad at my body for taking this long to rewire. I did this to myself. Anyway, I‚Äôll keep truckin‚Äô for now. I‚Äôll try some of the normal people sleep aids again (Benadryl, melatonin, etc). Maybe I‚Äôll be more susceptible to them as I stay clean, hasn‚Äôt worked for me thus far though.

I associate Halloween with drug use and I just wanted to feel well and party, it was a conscious choice that I made. No excuses, I wanted it, I didn‚Äôt care about the consequences and was an absolute idiot, but I did learn. I had to work in the morning and it turns out work is a HUGE trigger for me. Having to manage people and deal with the public is terrible for my personality type, as I‚Äôm a bit of an introvert and people can be draining to be around. I feel kind of crazy people when I‚Äôm off H, H kind of makes me even keeled. It‚Äôs funny you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be more crazy on it, but off it I feel out of control sometimes. Being off H I get really hyper sometimes and don‚Äôt really Pay attention to what I‚Äôm saying, so I kick my own ass in a work setting when I say stupid things. I‚Äôm aware of where my biggest trigger is now, mainly having to behave in a professional manner around clients and coworkers or forced social interactions, which I‚Äôve never had the self control to do in my life. Anyways on the way to score dope, I saw a man who completely fell out at a bus stop, he looked like Gumby.  I‚Äôm disgusted with myself as my first thought wasn‚Äôt I should help... it was ‚Äúlooks like there‚Äôs good shit close by‚Äù yep.... I am a fucking piece of shit now. I had no narcan on me and I also feel god awful for not having any, I fucked up... i told the bus driver to call an ambulance and left. I should have stayed and tried to help the guy, but I wanted my shit and didn‚Äôt want to wait for police to show. It‚Äôs not just Dopes fault, but being in a city makes people develop a look the other way attitude and I didn‚Äôt even think twice I was on a mission to score. My morality has been corrupted by my addiction and city life. I see people nodded out every week, but this man was different and I knew it, and I did next to nothing. Just like all the normal and cold people that were getting on and off the bus. This was like an omen and my reaction is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. I found my d boy surrounded by junkies and homeless peeps for protection if the cops ran up, like some kind of chaotic king of shit. Also like an omen. So I‚Äôm going to take a dose before work tommorrow and then flush the rest of what I bought, get thru work and start back at it. My identity is so wrapped up in my drug use that I have a hard time letting go of it. It‚Äôs not even about opiates, it‚Äôs about the habits and identity of self I built from my usage. Who am I without opiates? I don‚Äôt know anymore, but I want my soul back.",3,0

BUT it‚Äôs a good story! Nothing bad happened....phew 

If this would have happened 19 days ago I could have and most likely would have been arrested right in front of my boss, which in turn would have lost me everything. 18 days ago I quit heroin. Today when I got pulled over my heart instantly dropped. My head went to the first place it would have gone if I was still using, ‚Äúshit what do I have on me or in my backpack?!‚Äù Then I realized I didn‚Äôt have anything to worry about. Wow it was amazing and a great interaction with the law.

A little back story and I promise I‚Äôll keep it long, so skip ahead if you don‚Äôt care lol. My last real ticket was in June/July of 2013. I took my ex wife to Disney land! We were driving down the main stretch of I-5 and it had been 70mph for as long as I could remember. All of a sudden I get pulled over and the cop tells me about a mile back it changed to 65 so I was going 74 in a 65. Basically it was my 2nd ticket and my first was about 3-4 years prior. He wrote me a ticket even though I was unaware of the change, new state, and it was dark out. But whatever. Now let‚Äôs fast forward to 2017. I just got divorced from said Ex and I had 2 vehicles and she has 0. So I was a nice guy and let her have a car until she was able to get one which took 9 months. She didn‚Äôt do anything to my Jeep including the tabs which were expired 8 months ago when I got it back. LITERALLY the day she gave it back to me on my way home I got pulled over and I wasn‚Äôt even aware at that point that my tabs were expired. It was a state patrol not a city unit so there were 2 cops that now came to my car. They didn‚Äôt believe my story for one second, but luckily they got a more important call, told me to get my shit taken care of because they could have legally impounded my vehicle I guess, at least that‚Äôs what they told me, and then let me go. 

Ok now we are at today, so I haven‚Äôt legally been ticketed for almost 7 years now. I was going 71 mph in a 60 on my way home from dropping my boss off. I‚Äôm a personal driver for him as he is legally blind. So anyways I see the cop outside his car with the radar gun, I look down I‚Äôm going 71 and said god damnit. I saw him get back in his car and instantly got behind me with the lights on. That‚Äôs when my head played tricks on me until i realized I had nothing to worry about. So I tell me boss we are getting pulled over, and instantly he says‚Äù oh shit it‚Äôs probably because the tabs are expired‚Äù HAHAHAHA I started laughing so much in my head and almost couldn‚Äôt control it. I was like what are the chances? Well he came up to our car, asked me for ID and registration. And asked me if I knew how fast I was going and why. I told him
The truth, I said I looked down and realized I was going 70-71 mph and was just not paying attention. He said ok I‚Äôll be right back. So me and my boss start talking and I tell him I‚Äôm sorry and don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll cover the speeding fee, and he said yea no problem I‚Äôll cover the expired tabs fee and we both kinda laughed. Then unexpectedly, the cop comes back, says ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the tabs and just says thank you for being honest have a great day. No ticket no nothing, my mouth dropped and all I could say was thank you so much. And that was it! All of that stressing for nothing. 

Anyways sorry for the long post, it‚Äôs just an amazing thing being clean for almost 3 weeks and having things like this happen to you, which a few weeks ago I would have expected the worse, and today I got to laugh about it and appreciate law enforcement, which come on pigs are the last thing we wanted to see in our past... thanks for reading guys!",27,0

I'm 3 weeks clean. Before I got clean I always was running around looking to get money for my next shot. I get an unemployement benefit from the government but that is not enough to sustain a normal life plus a heroin addiction. So I took all kinds of odd jobs, anything that paid really.

A lot of time was put into looking for those jobs online, and doing those jobs in the real world.


Now I don't know what to do with my spare time. I mostly just sit behind my pc playing games and watching movies. 

I'm bored, depressed and I don't know what the fuck I gotta do with my spare time.

The depression stops me from picking a hobby that is not pc related, I think  something like 'oh, archery sounds cool to pick it up again' or any other activity,  but then I can't get myself to actually do it. So I just sit at home doing nothing.

Any advice?",9,0

So I recently started suboxone treatment for an oxycodone addiction (200-300mg a day). Hasn't been all sunshine obviously. I am on my fourth day now, at 12mg. The treatment in it self is fine, and since I am in Europe where treatment is free, money isn't a problem either. However, the problem is that it will take 12 months+ to kick this. That works for many people, but I don't think it will for me. I'll give it a week or two and have my first conversation with my ""treater"" (just the person supervising the treatment) on tuesday, and we will see how it goes from there.

Anyways, that was a bit of backstory, now to the main point.

The end goal of suboxone treatment and cold turkey is the same - being clean. The difference is, how much it is gonna hurt, and the duration of it. Each day I have to meet up between 8:30-11:30am to get my meds, while some dude sits and watches it dissolve under my tongue. I am 20 years of age, started pushing oxys and slipped. Now I am sitting here with people whos destinies went down the really wrong path. It is a motivation not to end up like ""them"" (sorry for the term, I am as much of an addict as everybody else. Don't get me wrong.) I have to do urine tests. All of this is fair, and a great way of treatment, however.

I talked to my mother, showed her kratom, talked to her about imodium and gabapentin and the things that can help WD's. She has a farm in the middle of no where, and she was open about the idea of me going out there. 7 days in WD, getting this toxic poison out of my body, and hopefully rise and shine on the 8th day.

I will stay in treatment for a few weeks more, but what are y'all inputs on this? Basically, riding it out at mothers farm with helpful tools (imodium, maybe kratom, maybe a little bit of sub, gabapentin, vitamin C and probably some benzos also) with her supervising me - giving me what I need when I need it, so I don't just eat 30 gabs and chug a bottle of benzos to feel better.

So yeah, inputs? Ideas? Thanks. Stay safe.",1,0
