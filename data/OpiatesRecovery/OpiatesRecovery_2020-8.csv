Currently she is on methadone and has been for a while, living with me. She's been doing very well, but would love more than anything to ditch the dose and trade that nasty syrup for a suboxon pill. That would entail very painful detox.  Can this be done here at home with me or is that not recommended because of the possibilities of seizures? I've dealt with some heavy heady stuff because of her addiction but this may be too much.  Thoughts?",2
2020-08-30 14:57:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/iji7ue/continuous_uncontrollable_puking/,"Continuous, uncontrollable puking","Trying to kick a years long oxy habit that turned into a crazy heroin habit about 4 months ago.  I have been snorting 10 to 15 bags a day. 

At about 9 hours after the last dose, I start throwing up. After about 12 hours, i literally can't keep water down. If i swallow it, it somehow increases in volume and turns to straight acid before i throw it up.  Like i said- just plain water will not stay in my stomach 5 minutes before I  puke til i am dry heaving  for a minute or two.  After that, i crave water,  rinse my mouth out, drink some then repeat.  By the 24 hour mark I honestly feel like I am dying.  And I cave. Yesterday, i snorted a bag at about 7a.m. I got ahold of a good amount of 10mg Methadone pills and took 40mg at about noon with zero relief, then 20 more mg a couple of hours later. Again, ZERO relief.  Then the puking started at about 8 that evening and continued until I woke up my plug at 7:45 and got some dope. Today, i am weak and exhausted.  Still no sleep, even after 5 bags spaced out over the last 7 hours. I am guessing that the methadone is blocking at least some of the dope. I was able to eat a small meal and can drink without puking now, but definitely not back to where i was on Friday.  So the methadone was not a good fit for me. I really thought that it would have at least helped but, if anything, seemed to make the puking worse. I had a lot of hope in the methadone. Tried a Suboxone clinic before that, and it didn't work for me, either.  

What now? Go to the ER when i get sick? I honestly do not know what to do. I am to the point that if I am not spending 400 to 600 a day on dope, I literally feel like I will die. And i really don't want to do that just yet. Any suggestions on comfort meds, good detox/rehab programs.......anything?  I am close to losing hope.",2

2020-08-30 08:25:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ijbvtu/dopamine_and_recovery/,Dopamine and Recovery,"Dopamine and addiction

Dopamine plays a large part in the addiction processes of the brain. Drugs such as cocaine can cause a quick spike of dopamine in the brain which satisfies the natural reward system in a big way. However, repeated drug use also raises the threshold for this kind of pleasure. This means you need to take more to get the same high (it creates tolerance).  Drugs also make your body less able to produce dopamine naturally, this leads to emotional lows when an individual is first getting sober.

Cocaine ingesting and seeking behaviors are strongly regulated by D1-like  and D2-like receptors. Pretreatment with either D1 or D2 receptor agonists reduces cocaine self-administration in rats, and pretreatment with either D1 or D2 receptor antagonists increases intake in rats. 

Heroin addiction is related to a passed down genetic mutation of the D2 gene. 

Ways to naturally increase dopamine include changing your diet, exercise, get enough sleep, get sunshine and meditate...all pretty tried and true mental health advice. If dopamine levels are low enough chances are it will be hard to create the motivation for any of that and sometimes medication is needed. As they say, if you can’t make your own neurotransmitters store bought is fine! 

Both of my parents were heroin addicts, and I very likely ended up with that same busted gene. That with a healthy dose  of trauma and other factors meant I went on to the same patterns of addiction. Despite my multiple attempts at getting clean it didn’t stick until I took a medication containing dopamine, I know this was not the only factor in my sobriety but it really really helped! Addiction is not just a willpower problem and we’ve had the science to back this up for many years now.

Only did it for 4 nights and this is the worst I've felt ever, off any drug","Won't get into too much detail, but I picked up some tar the other day that is 100% cut with fent - being that the half life was very shorts, didn't really have legs, more itchy, less euphoric, etc.

Now, even after just 4 days of lightly using at night, this evening absolutely sucked -- I never felt WD this bad or this soon after using. Usually with tar,  my legs are just restless and I have the chills the day AFTER I last use. I wouldn't say I'm a chronic opiate user at all, rather once in a while, but was having a shit week and went to go pick up  -

Now I'm really regretting it because I still have  a good amount felt but know I should not use it like I was using it. I start class on Monday and really want to avoid feeling like this when school starts, and don't want to use during the day/evening like I had to today, ugh.

This evening I had to just do a little bit of it to help with the horrible feelings I was having  - horrible restless legs, some diarrhea  and just overall achiness and chills, with very bad dry mouth - I don't want it to get worse than that!   I did just enough to help with the achiness, but other than that I still feel somewhat uncomfortable, but nothing that is too bad. No where near the amount I did the last few days. I am going to smoke some weed also now to  help with it - but I just thought I'd come here looking for insight.

Will tapering help with WDs? I use a little less each night in order to avoid this feeling as much as I can.  Like I said, I still feel shitty now, but not as bad as before.

Will tapering help? What about kratom? I have some  phenibut  also which I read will help?  Any insight or advice is appreciate, thank you!",3

2020-08-28 20:03:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/iiijvy/question_for_users_in_the_southwest/,Question for users in the Southwest,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting here. I just discovered this subreddit from the comments section of a front page post so I thought I would post something that's been on my mind recently.  It's long, but bear with me. 

I'm a 35 year old male who sort of went through a mid life crisis recently.  I've always exercised multiple times a week, ate healthy, and generally took care of myself. A couple years ago I got married and made career change to a position in a new industry with great growth potential. The pay was awesome but the hours were not. I was routinely putting in 14-15 hours a day and occasionally would work 40-50 days straight without a day off. I had never struggled with depression but that amount of work very quickly began having a negative effect on my mental and marital well being. 

In comes a buddy from childhood who has struggled with opioid addiction his whole life but is high functioning and also has a great job so we maintained a friendship over the years. He knows that occasionally I smoke weed and had  experimented with ecstasy/shrooms while in college so one day he offered me a way to mitigate the oppressive level of stress I had been feeling. I agreed and picked up a couple little blue pills that looked like percocet M stamps. Before I took any he warned me that they are not real percocet, but instead some new cartel concoction that contains fentanyl. I've heard the horror stories of people dying after only taking one pill but trusted him when he said to only take a quarter at first, then wait an hour, then take another quarter if I need to. I did as instructed, godamn was it pure fucking bliss. I absolutely loved the high and strangely enough it was basically a depression cure.  As long as I didn't take enough to get the nods, I could work all day and not have a problem with it.  Amazing. 

Unfortunately, as you all can imagine, the hook set in pretty deep. After 8 straight months of every day use I was up to 10-15 a day depending on the strength.  My buddy was at around 50-75 a day at his worst. We got them from a runner for the cartel in Phoenix and even though the ""batches"" would always look slightly different (some light blue some dark some soft some hard) they were always pretty strong. I could tell that if I wasn't careful I knew that one day my wife would wake up next to a corpse. I forgot to mention that I chewed them, I don't fuck with needles.  I had read an article that the bioavailability of most oral medications is at their highest when they absorbed through the salivary glands in the mouth. Apparently its the second best way to feel the ""rush"" behind slamming it.  Plus it was more discreet than racking a line and snorting. One day, some guy that my buddy knows from the east coast (who is also a heavy user) is visiting friends in AZ when he decides to try the fake percs out here. He takes two over the course of like 4 hours, which was normal for me, and the next day we get the call that he never woke up. My Buddy had heard from other users in the area that the blues in Phoenix, and Southwetern US, are the strongest fake percs that money can buy. 

Has anyone else in the region heard or experienced this? I'm 2 months clean now, but my withdrawal was exceptionally bad according to the ER Dr when my wife drove me in. I don't remember much of it other than feeling so bad I begged for death. My wife said for 2 days straight I just rolled around on the ground pissing myself and throwing up with my eyes in the bag of my head. Luckily I consulted with an addiction specialist before hand who prescribed me subutex and told my wife to administer them when I hit a certain score on the COWS test. But this Dr also agreed that my withdrawal was one of the worst he's seen in his 25 years as an addiction specialist.  I stumbled down the internet research rabbit hole and found a DEA report online a couple weeks ago that broke down the strength of pills confiscated in drug busts. If I remember correctly the southwest states pills tested at the highest purity.  Scary.  My buddy is going to be in a world of hurt whenever he decides to detox. He thinks he might need to be put into a medically induced coma so his body/brain doesn't go into shock, but I don't think that's an option.",3

I've been taking 0.5mg for the last week or so. Tired of feeling like a robot. Tired of going through the motions of life with no real satisfaction.

For anyone curious about the withdrawals, I'll keep y'all posted on how it goes. I'm nervous, but also excited to start feeling again, whether it be good or bad feelings. I'd rather feel sadness than not feel anything at all

I abused oxy for about 2.5 years. Started off doing 10 or 15mg per day at first then gradually increased to 300+mg per day after two years. Been on subs since late May, tapered from 8mg down to 0.3 since then though I did relapse a couple times (but stuck to my taper). Initially subs weren't bad at all, though I think a part of that was just being able to be active again. But since after going below 1mg I've noticed I'm tired all the time and generally depressed. Fuck that. 

Wish me luck. My awesome GF and family are supporting me through this. Took next week off work and going on a road trip for up to 3 weeks (working remotely after next week). Doctor gave me some hydroxyzine for the restless legs and for sleep, I also have some xans and supplements like vitamin c, magnesium, Imodium, and Epsom salts.


So fucking ready to be done with this shit y'all. It's been eating me up from the inside for years. Let's fucking gooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have suboxone, but I dont feel like it's working.
They've upped my dose multiple times and im currently taken a 12 in the a.m and 8 in the pm.
And I was told to take halves of an 8 when I felt overwhelmed.  The problem is I feel overwhelmed all the time these days.
I cant talk to my husband, he's just not the person I thought he was and has turned into a very selfish price.
He can never watch our kids alone unless that includes screaming at them or spanking them for dumb shit& i won't have that. Id rather loose a week of sleep than leave him alone with my damn kids. But its fucking hard.  I had a dentist appointment yesterday to get this tooth pulled that cuts my tongue when I talk and I haven't eaten any real food in about 2 weeks now..
He was screaming at the kids so loud the dentist tech asked me to go calm the kids down and or ask my husband to wait his turn outside, so I went to talk to my kids and him & he snapped about how his space got taken cus i was taken too long.(I have severely damaged and broken teeth, more broken than good so of course it was gunna be a bit but he couldn't handle the 2 young ones at the same time..) 
And then he ordered me to switch with him and to stop my appointment mid way thru and to get my ""damn kids"" so I did what any normal mother would do and I ended my appointment and asked him to help me get them into the car...
He walked me out after yelling and telling me I could do it by my effing self & he literally put my son in the front seat. Slammed the door in our faces and walked away. . It was pouring and I couldn't help but be so fucking mad and grabbed one of my subs and took it.. 
The irony of this fucking matter is heavy on me, the more suboxone I take the worst my teeth aget,and the less suboxone I take the more my cravings to get high and stop my teeth pain grows.
I dont know how to make it another 3 weeks to get into my doctor and the damn dentist again..
I dont know how I will make it thru the weekend with how badly I've been feining for heroin.
I hate being an addict. But my love for heroin is still so strong, its like an ex toxic lover that I just want to get my damn hands all over. 
But I also know the facts after seeing so many die from a relapse or losing my friends to the drug its conflicting. 
Suboxone is doing more damage to my body than helping it at this point and I don't qualify for the viviatrol shot from my past sucicidal tendencies.
Calling my Dr is not an option they're closed today. 
Sorry for the long post I guess I just needed to vent to know I'm not alone in this fucked up battle between life and death.
I just feel the call of death is so loud and strong right now, id almost sell my soul for a line or a shot..god do I miss the warmth and even the nose tingle of the snort.",31

As the title states I’m almost 2 months clean from a several year relationship with pain pills. I’m happy and grateful and proud while simultaneously depressed, anxious, and full of self hatred. The ratio of those feelings vary wildly from day to day. I was doing quite well in general but the last couple days have been an avalanche of cravings. I don’t know how, or probably more accurately won’t, move forward. I’m worried about relapse. I’m worried about being miserable and in pain everyday. I feel stuck. 
I have slowly made friends and a support system that has been instrumental. I really appreciate these people and recognize they’re why I’ve remained clean thus far. I have grown in my ability to be vulnerable and have greatly diminished how deep I dig myself into isolation. 
But I still feel depressed and broken and literally destructive. I am the problem. I have this urge to lay in bed alllll day tomorrow and do nothing but sleep, cry, maybe read NA shit, and probably dip back into self isolation. It feels so much... idk safer... less risk. I don’t think I’m ready to actually trust people yet. I’ve been burned too many times.
Sorry to ramble on without a true point but wanted it out of my head. Thanks to all you lovely souls.

Wanted to share a research article showing a case study that discusses the use of Ibogaine HCL by a single Methadone patient. Apparently they were able to completely eliminate withdrawals and get off Methadone completely within a month, while taking increasing doses of Ibogaine on several occasions, but never enough to cause heart issues.

I've currently stabilized on 1mg of Suboxone after a heroin relapse lasting seven months (was addicted for four years and sober for eight months before the relapse occurred). I'll be using a similar protocol to this one in order to quit the Suboxone. Will report back to you all within two months with the results.

It's up for grabs as to if they make me feel a bit better.

I have insurance now and I can go to the Dr by myself and I really want to so I can protect myself from these things happening but it will screw my buddy up from going. Let's be honest I get the shit end of the stick on the split anyway. 

But at the same time I'm sick of being on subs altogether, but I'm afraid if I use Kratom or whatever to get off of them I'll just end up using again and I'm so stressed right now I'm hoping this handful of trams makes me feel at least some better.

Need suggestions.,"I've been doing H for the past 5 years now on and off. During those 5 years I have had a year clean - went back to it then had another 8 months clean. Then Various weeks and months of clean time.I have now been sniffing (Never IV) for the past 5 months and need to quit for good! Seriously never going back to it after this time. Even though I am depressed and generally unhappy (which is what led me to the drug in the first place), my life has such potential to be great. I know I can be happy and enjoy life without it.

So during this last 5 months I just cant seem to quit. During previous runs, when I committed to quitting, I just did it. Now I cant seem to get past day one! I think it has to do with the reliability of my dealer. It's just so easy to get. When I get around the 24 hour mark and start feeling pretty shitty I just justify getting more  because it's not like I have any clean time, I might as well just do it one more time. Lately everyday I tell myself this is the last time. It's easy to say when you're on it. But then the next day I know how easy it is to meet up with my dealer and feel good again.

I know if I can get 7 days clean, i'm good and wont go back to it. At that point it would just be incredibly stupid to go back and I know that in my head. I'm past the worst and only better times to come.

**Suboxone** \- I made a virtual appointment on [Quick.MD](https://Quick.MD) to talk to a doctor about a suboxone prescription. I really don't want to substitute one drug for another, but I just need a little bit of help getting to day 7. I do not want to become dependent on suboxone and I certainly don't want to have to withdrawl from suboxone. Does anyone have any tips on how to properly use Suboxone as just a way to get past the initial week. Should I keep using after the initial withdrawl? Does suboxone just delay withdrawl and when I get off it I still need to withdrawl? Basically I just need to curb my cravings. The physical stuff I can deal with. I just need to know that picking up is not an option. I know these are questions for the doctor but I wanted to get some other opinions on this.

I need and want to live completely sober. I have a great family,  great job. I have not hit rock bottom in terms of losing loved ones, getting in trouble, or just destroying my life. I do it because I am so much more productive. My work productivity increases 100x. Which is another reason why I justify it. But doing H is just not me. I need to get off.

He's still sober!!! He's not deterred from his path and is super happy with this new place. 

Turns out, the previous one in his mind was borderline a cult mentality, almost abusive in the way they handled the guys living there, and he just didn't jive with them.

I wake up and the first thing I think about is the blank slate of the day and it terrifies me.  It usually takes about an hour or two to come down from the anxiety and panic of wondering how I’m going to fill the day.  In that time, I think about trying to contact my plug, I try to plan my day so that I’m constantly busy in order to prevent myself from doing just that, and I try to force myself to get going with my day after my coffee works its shit-producing magic.  If I can do all these things, I’m usually okay.  Some mornings are worse than others - like today.

And the truth is there are only two things I miss: the euphoria that hits 20 minutes after swallowing the pill and how I didn’t have to look at the memories and thoughts the pills hid from me.  Everything else I don’t miss at all.  The lethargy, the stomach problems, the constipation, knowing I was killing my liver cuz I was taking at least 15 10/325 Norcos a day, the vacant interactions with my SO, the short-temper when they would start to wear off, trying to come up with an excuse to tell my SO why I was so tired at 2pm, and trying to run from the near-constant WDs.  I don’t miss any of that.  

But right now, at something like 35 days - I’m not counting because it was increasing the anxiety and felt more like a test than an accomplishment - what I DO miss still outweighs what I don’t.  I’m scared to go to an NA meeting (online or in-person), but this sub has really helped me when its darkest.  I know people say it gets better, I can even feel some of it now, but mornings are still terrifying.

I’m about 2 months off of pressed 30s. Recently, I’ve noticed something that people say to those of us in recovery that bothers me a lot - that they just want the old so-and-so back. When my parents have said this to me, I get immensely sad and confused. Too much has happened in my life the past few years - before I started using - to somehow revert back to the young adult I was. What’s with the romanticization of our pre-using self? In my mind, that version of me /clearly/ wasn’t working, as I started taking drugs to avoid reality. My recovery isn’t about reverting to who I used to be - rather, it’s about building a better me.

He says he does, but I just don’t see it. And the constant telling me this is the last time just makes me feel manipulated and stupid. 

I feel as if I’m being super selfish because after all he is the one struggling with addiction. But it makes me feel like I am not enough. I was already in a long term relationship with an alcoholic and I felt the same way. Like that I can’t make someone happy and make them feel fulfilled, which led me to be in a depressive state so bad that I couldn’t get out of bed most mornings.",10

After 2 yrs of perc use (worst was 200mg/day) i desperately want to get clean. Never made it past day 4 any time I've tried. Ready to be done with this. Have 2 subs (i take an 8th of a strip when i do them) really really need advice/support/encouragement. 


So.. I really want to get clean. I've tried and failed and I'm just at my limit and really want to be done..

Two years ago I started doing percs on occasion. Maybe once a month. Its funny because before that i would never touch them because both my parents were addicted. I would sell any script I got. 
My boss at my job where it all started was an addict. I had a day my back hurt (i have severe back issues) and he gave me 5mg perc. Then i would occasionally do them for the next few months (no more than 20mg in a day) I told myself that I can do it responsibly unlike my parents (i know, stupid) but then I found myself buying them everyday with my tip money and buying more and more every day. At the worst i was doing 200 or more mg a day. I was snorting them now. 

I ended up getting my first sub when it got to the point i would have to snort 4 at once to feel anything at all. 
I broke the sub into 8th and took it for 3 days and then found myself going and buying percs day four. 

So for the last 2 years I've managed to take occasional 2-4 day breaks with the help of a sub. It's crazy how bad the withdrawals are so quickly if I have nothing in my system. 

I've been spending so much money. I blew through a nice inheritance and sold a brand new car to get money for percs. 

I am at that point I so desperately want to quit. I want to break this cycle Im in. I have two sub strips ready to go. I've never made it past four days. I always end up thinking about getting ps and I end up giving in. I have a problem where I am laying around all day and get bored and get them. Or Im dealing with a depressive episode and get them (i have ptsd, panic disorder, severe anxiety, and borderline personality disorder so my depressive episodes get really bad. ) I just always give in after 3-4 days and I dont want that anymore

I take an 8th of a strip when I take a sub. I did ps today but tomorrow I'm going to start on subs again. I really want this to be the end. 

Please i desperately need advice on getting through this... Or any encouragement and support. 

Thank you for reading.",2

My second question is about relapse. I'm strong enough to say that im weak against opiates, this means i know i could relapse at any moment which makes me scared. I was using around 45-60 mg Oxy on a daily basis the first time i quit, im scared to OD, so my question is, in case i used on day 10 how much should i take?

Wed it arrived. I put it in capsules. 

About 150mg in capsules. Hours go by, nothing. Huh.. 

Thursday morning I double it in a capsule 300mg. 2 hours later I understood why this stuff is pretty evil. Yeah I felt it.

Thursday night 300mg again.

Friday, today, 300mg. Around 8am.


That's it. That's all I've done. And I swear I've got chills. My anxiety rocketed so I just took 1mg clonazepam.

we know it was stupid and regretted it right away which is why we only did like less than a quarter of our normal doses. after that disappointment we have no desire to buy that much more because we haven’t made it this long clean in about 6 months and refuse to go backwards. any advice is greatly appreciated. 
we just want to get better so badly, more than anything. i hate that we slipped up. but holy fuck CT is HARD mentally and we have a big decision and move to make by the end of the month. maybe if we bought only one this time and split it today or tomorrow would it help the withdrawals a little more? it still seems like a dramatic taper to me considering we needed so many every day for about 2 months then went the longest we ever have in those months clean and did such a tiny small dose. 
also after buying one  more to split tonight or tomorrow there would be no choice or money to buy more.
i’m my opinion this might stretch withdrawl out by a day or more but also be way more bearable? he woke up feeling a lot worse than i did today. i mostly just have the restless legs. we’re 22 and 23 and have only been using the 30s heavily for about 3 months before we took this break. typically we always cave by day 2 so i’m still really proud. just worried about not being able to function again. any advice or experiences would really help us out. thank you!!",3

Every night this week when I lay in bed the muscles in my legs tighten up like crazy. Muscle spasticity? I don't know. But it's so ungodly uncomfortable. And on top of that I have rls shaking my feet as well. I am getting about 2 hours of sleep a night. I have to knock myself out with 2lbs of epsom salt bath and 2-3mg of Xanax.

Now this is what I mean I can't figure out the cause... My legs were only doing rls during withdrawal from opiates... Not this muscle bs too. 

2 weeks ago I chose to stop my opiate addiction. I wasn't even enjoying them anymore. That's my sober line lately, what's the point of being high if it's not fun? Anyways my use was off and on since my relapse in March when covid isolation forced my hand. I used suboxone for 3 days. And I was pretty much in the clear except for mental and cravings. And of course rls. But no muscle leg pain like I'm having now.

During my first few days of opiate withdrawal I was taking boat loads of gabapentin since I have a tolerance as I take it everyday anyways. Boat load I mean like 3g compared to my prescribed 900mg daily. This was only for 3 days or so then I stopped and went back down.

Next we have phenibut. I have this in 250mg caps. I usually only take it at night at about 1g. Sometimes + or - 1 or 2. I only took a good dose of phenibut the first day of withdrawal as my Rls worsened with it. Like crazy worse. So I'm still at 1g give or take at night.

Since the mental part is kicking my ass I got a small supply of...ummm.. Probably wannabe Adderall... Mm a dark net user and these presses probably have Adderall in them and possibly meth. I only take 1 in the morning to get me able to work (from home). The lack of sleep is not helping either. Could this be causing it? Just seems odd since I take it in the morning. But I do have all the usual bs from stim come down. Anxiety and depression. Or that's opiate withdrawal... Lol. But I don't plan to use these stims for too long. I hate stims. I have enough anxiety in life as is.

I am also taking Xanax for anxiety. Trying like hell to limit it. It's been 1 week since I started using it so now I need to dial back. I do have clonazepam 0.5mg, that's prescribed so the Xanax.. Yeah lol. 

Getting my Ambien refilled tomorrow too. 

I think that's it...

I've really been wondering at night if people who had their legs amputated get phantom restless leg.... Because I won't lie ill find out for us if I can't get to bed each night until 4am to wake up at 655 to work at 7. Yes I give myself 5 minutes to log onto my computer. I am trying to get EVERY minute of sleep I can. Lol",3

I really need to get a few things off my chest, and maybe a little advice. 
I fell in love with opiates 25 yrs ago. It's been a fucked up love affair ever since. I'm also a daily cannabis smoker.  
After a while you figure out where you want to be. Opiates and good smoke is my sweet spot. 
I haven't did any IV heroin in 2 yrs but I recently got strung out on Roxi 30. Mainly due to the fact that dope around here is garbage lately. Anyways, I tried kicking the entire month of July and finally stopped on Aug. 1st. 
Partly my choice, mostly because I was broke. 
Anyways, I feel like in in a war. The kicking part wasn't bad. No sleep, sweats, etc.  The few weeks after my emotions are all over the place and I feel guilty about everything. I've been smoking and taking Xanax, the whole time I'm guilty as hell but love the benefits of weed. I know abstinence is the only answer but I just really struggle with that. 

It's definitely a war in my head right now.

Once I'd found a newsagent willing to count and exchange these coppers it was about  £40. Barely enough to keep me well let alone say a proper goodbye.

So during the first few months off gear I was obsessed by this machine. I kept thinking: I can't stay clean because of that machine. It denied me the goodbye I needed.

But the problem wasn't that machine. The problem was this one. Humans are insatiable craving machines, because our brains are built more for wanting than liking...

I might be getting at job at Targét soon, and even if I don’t, I’m still looking for work. I’ve discovered that I’m not a very good worker strung out.

I have 16 4 mg sub strips, and might grab some more, but I think I can set up a nice little taper. I also have some kratom. I’ve found from past attempts I need to take things slow, or I’ll relapse and then get bummed out. Which leads to more use.

I’ll post again in a few days. Wish me luck, this is gonna be rough. My head is what messes me up, but I’ve found weed has helped with cravings. So that’s something.",1

Would getting the prescription for either the Vivitrol shot or the oral pill go on my permanent medical record? I would like to avoid getting labeled as an addict for the rest of my life. 

My possible roadblock is that I do not have a PCP at the moment. Would I need one to get the prescription? If not, what would be the best way of going about getting said prescription? Is there anywhere I can look up places locally that would see me without having a PCP? 

In a perfect world I would like to find a place that prescribes, go in, take a drug test (I assume they would test as you need to be like two weeks clean to get it I believe?) and get the shot there or a prescription for the oral pills and then go to a pharmacy to fill them. Is this possible? Maybe the shot would be better since I then wouldn’t have to fill a prescription which may end up on my record? Is that how it works? Is there such places that just administer the shot to you with basically one appointment?

It started subtly, dental surgery pain prescription. 


Subtly like alot of abuse starts just little things to begin with, taking a few extra, extending the script once the pain stopped. 


Then the abuse ramps up a bit, it starts to effect your health, you stop feeling the fuzzy high and take just to feel ok.


At this point you know you should stop, you know it's not good for you,  and maybe no one's even noticed you have a problem yet, and like an abusive relationship, they probably know.


But you can't just leave! It's not that bad....so you think your kidneys might be failing,  so what if your liver hurts, can't pee? Can't shit? Can't remember how it feels to actually feel?
What's all that to having a fail safe happiness pill. 



But eventually, possibly even years later like me you wake up and think to yourself,  am I happy?
But your terrified to leave because it will HURT 



The pills wont let you leave without a fight, and the pain won't go quickly it lingers and lingers and its so tempting to go back because you know with just a few pills all the pain will go away. 


And that's how it kills you,  it's killing you all the while making you feel warm fuzzy and loved.
This shit will slowly rot your body while making you feel amazing.


But in those times between doses, you feel it.
You know your bodys fucked up,  but for some of us, maybe many maybe most,  it takes knocking on deaths door before we pause and take a step back .


Last time I managed 9 months before relapse, but that time I was not nearly as damaged as I am this time.
It sucks you back in like a toxic ex, you know it's always there and its never far from your mind.



My life isn't endless rounds of trips to the pharmacy, I'm awake in the morning, the pain is gone,  my insides are healing.


And I feel empty,  i fucking miss it.


I miss it so much, but I want to live and I want to be awake.

So I need to make it past day 10 this time. This fentadope bs around philly is going to kill me. I already lost custody of my first baby who is 7 now. My husband, who is on his way to becoming my first ex-husband.. is threatening to take my second little boy from me because of the relapse and hiding it from him. We don’t have a good relationship where I’d feel I can tell him things like that for various shitty reasons. I’m struggling in every way possible. I have a job I work everyday as well. I need the kratom to help as much as possible.

I took it by day 4 last time so the worst of the withdrawal already was almost over kind of.

Was probably asked a thoused times already but I'm too nervous or stupid to find the answers, so I am asking again. Please forgive me! 

Been using opiates for almost a decade and finally got addicted ~2years ago. Went through wds after 3 months, then it was an on/off thing where I'd use for a few days, go through small wd, stay away a little, repeat. 9, almost 10 months ago I finally got stuck for good and have been using non-stop since then. My toerance went up rather quickly and has stayed on a very high level since February. (like really high doses, I use just as much as the people I met on the street that have been using since 10+ years, some up to 30 years) 

Now I really need to stop. I've blown through all the money I had and it is no loner sustainable in any way or shape. I've got two weeks off work, starting 29. August that I plan to use for the detox. 

My questions: 
     
     1.) what do I have to expect? What symptoms in what time-frame and how bad will it probably get? 

      2.) what can I do to prepare/make it easier? I was able to obtain some diazepam (7x10mg) and immodium, electrolyte powder and I will cook a couple of easy digestible meals on the last day of using. 

       3.) I live with a roommate who is an ex-user but not aware of my addiction and I want to keep it that way. How do I best hide the symptoms and exlain those that can't be hidden? (ideally without provoking a covid quarantine). 


I'd be extremely grateful for any infomation, tipps, ideas, help, anything. I'm terrified of the wd and also of what comes after and I hope that knowing what to expect will help. 

Longest I went without was 12h and I already felt anxiety, light sensitivity, small stomach issues, sweating but feeling cold and had huge pupils. I'terrified of what's to come and even more afraid that I won't go through with it all the way or relapse soon. (I tried staying away before but always went back)

Thank you so much for taking the time to read and possibly help!

My withdrawals have never been this bad before, so I was wondering what I should expect?, how I should dose the suboxone?, how your supposed to ingest it?, and whether or not I will develop PAWS? Also wondering how long it’ll take for me to fee 100% again, in terms of the mental aspect as well, no depression etc?

Now, my question is this. I know there are no miracle cures here, but is there anything I can get with him to help with his symptoms? I do know that he struggles more with the body symptoms like RLS and aches and pains more than stomach distress. 

FTR he's currently on 220 per day of methadone, and does between 6 and 9 caps a day of fentanyl injected.

My friend and I are both 28 (f), I haven’t physically seen her since We were 19, but we went to high school in A different country together and have been close since. We call every few weeks and text when we can. 
She has been to prison twice for drug charges, lost both her kids, etc. I thought she was doing better since her last time in prison but after she got her kids taken she relapsed. 
I called her a few days ago and she burst into tears and said she has been homeless for months, she was even high on heroin as we were talking. I had no idea she was living like that, I bought her a plane ticket for 4 hours from then, ubered her to the airport, and put her in my guest room. 
I can’t say I completely understand everything she’s gone though, but she’s tired of having no life. She says she just wants to be a person again, see if there are hobbies she actually likes, do people things.
You guys, I can’t express how strong and amazing she is. She is on her third day of withdrawals right now, I can hear her groans all throughout the house, but she isn't breaking. She's being strong and brave and she's not caving, it's amazing. She can even manage to laugh and giggle when I remind her to hit the weed pen. 
I fill her night table with chocolate, snacks, ice cream, water, Gatorade, and tons and tons and tons of weed. I am making her drink liquids, and the weed is helping the appetite. 
I do have some entry level medical liscenses (CNA and LPN) so, while I can’t treat her, I can monitor her and vitals. 
I carried her to the bath last night and had her soak her muscles in CBD menthol bubble bath. 
I don’t know what else I can do. This is a whole other universe for me. I've read so much about it, I know this is just the beginning and I can't ""cure""
I am the only person she knows in this Washington, she is from Michigan. It helps that she doesn't have any connects whatsoever here. 
From the perspective of people who have actually gone through this, can anyone please tell me how I can better help or ease this? 
I just feel so anxious and over my head about this. I am not letting her know at all how completely unconfident I feel.

Mixing opiates with sleepers and cough syrup with codeine so I could be numb to fucking my life up and made these weird bets with myself like, if I can get through a shift with six pills then I could justify ‘treating myself’ to an extra helping that night to get buzzed. I’ve went though the withdrawals before so I knew what to expect. Planning it for a year maybe more but always found a reason to put it off, ‘oh well I can’t do it now because I have to be sharp for work/I can’t really go and meet my friends when I’m cold turkey in case they ask questions.’
I got my shit together over the weekend and opened up to someone about everything. 
trying to fill the void of being buzzed by pushing myself to my limits with exercise and I wrecked my ankle but managed to ignore the addiction screaming that we needed pain relief. 
I’m not one to share anything so personal with anybody I know, let alone a community of internet strangers but I’m just looking for some tips and tricks on how to keep the right mindset as it’s always just one more pill that will throw me back down the road of fucking my life up.",3

Mind you back then it was codeine(lean) and the occasional norco or perc 5. I graduated back in 2015 and shortly after went through a slight Xanax addiction, followed by a severe fentanyl addiction lol. It was easy for me to stop taking xans because I wasn’t trying to get off drugs forever, I just swapped out Xanax for opiates. It started off with me getting back into promethazine with codeine but after seeing how much prices had went up, I got into norco and Percocet 10s. After using them occasionally( just randomly when I could get them before going out somewhere fun) I started using them literally whenever I could get my hands on them and I would go searching through all of my contacts till I could find them. I started seeing how expensive this too could be and I was working a low paying job and got introduced to what I thought were roxy 30mg blues.... I’m sure maybe a couple I got a first might have been real but I started thinking... “why pay 60$ for 6 percs to get high, when I could buy one blue for 20$ and be just as faded for the whole night..” I’m sure it crossed my mind a few times that they had to be fake for the price, but I didn’t wanna believe it because it seemed too good to pass up... so now it’s been over a year since I would sometime use those blues and now I am taking literally as many as I can get my hands on a day(4-8) despite having no job and being in debt to everyone I know and even my bank account shutting down on me because of late payments. I know damn well they are pressed with fentanyl because I’ve tried to stop many fucking times but can’t make it past day 3 not only because of the withdrawals, but because of the idea of how easy it is to take that away. I finally have manned up and told my family and my girlfriend I will be going to a detox center and after trying to get in today, it looks like the soonest assessment they could do will be tomorrow at 5pm due to having to have a recently negative Covid test results. I am not even allowed to have nicotine there let alone weed and I’ve been smoking both since 9th grade as well. None of my friends know I use so I didn’t really have anyone to tell and I know this post is all over the place it is my first time posting despite religiously lurking through all the opiate/ fentanyl sub Reddit’s for the past year as well.

You can be late once in a blue moon and they will look past it. Now with covid, we only go in mondays and thursdays. I was late maybe 2 months ago because my phone updated in my sleep. They said if youre late again we cant let you dose, ""we let you this time because its several days in between"". Well today i was obviously late by an hour. I work nights and had to work extra late and even texted my therapist saying to call me if i dont text her by 845. Well my phone apparently wasnt plugged in all the way and died. My therapist even messaged them explaining i was scared id miss my dose. All the lady she messaged said was ""she knows the dosing hours"". Like no shit. I know them and respect them so much i have nightmares about this. I even said something because i was so scared. And i would most likely have woke up if it wasnt for my stupid fucking phone. 

Anyways. Its absolutly heartless i am having to wait until thursday. Normally, i would understand (to an extent) and be able to get by until the next day. That rule makes sense. If you miss a daily dose, its poasible to wait a day and not miss your next day dose and youd be okay. Im stunned they actually turned me away. My concern is not even fully about the physical sickness. I feel mentally shitty too. This has put me in such a negative headspace. Im depressed and feel like a fucking idiot and a failure. I feel like nobody gives a shit. I am trying so hard. I really am. Ive been doing so fucking good. I start school tomorrow and i cant be sick, ive also got to watch 5 kids. Mine and a friends kids. 

My counselor talked to her supervisor as well and they said ""we just wont budge on this kind of stuff anymore"". I guess some people ruined it for me by taking advantage of a lateness policy.

I dont feel like this should be super strict rule as long as we are only going 2 days a week. Once covid is over and we go back to daily dosing, i feel as though it is more appropriate and professional to start this policy again, but only then. Its not like im ever late. This is my second time being late. Im very responsible and take this seriously. Its my life. This has saved me. I would get it if i was late all the time or even once a week, because that just shows you dont care. But im not and i care. It doesnt make sense. Its hurting me not helping me. Im afraid i wont be able to pull myself out. There has GOT to be a way around this. I feel so embarassed and devestated. They make me feel like some dumb irresponsible addict. Like im being punished.

I’m a 22 y/o male and have been addicted to mostly oxy and hydrocodone for about a year and a half, but have also done dope probably around 20 times. My friend, who I had been best friends with since first grade, was also into drugs but loved them alittle more than I did. I had told him I wasn’t cool with H the last couple of months because I wasnt trying to get addicted to that, I already loved oxy and hydros so much I knew if I got heavily addicted to dope it would be the end of me. This lead to him doing it by himself and even though me and him talked literally every day and grew even closer this last year than ever before in our 16 year long friendship, he became pretty heavily addicted to dope without me knowing the full extent. About 4 days ago I went to his place and chilled with him for a bit and could tell he was on something, so I asked and he told me he was on dope. I wasn’t mad and chilled with him for a bit longer, but left soon after because he was offering me some and the urge was getting strong to do it. The next morning I woke up to his cousin calling me saying he walked in and found him dead. I’ve been so heartbroken over this and not sure how to process this, I don’t blame myself but I wonder how different it could have been if I stayed and hungout with him...he told me he had narcan and would be safe (he always was) but this shit just sucks. In honor of him I will be quitting all opiates, which will be a big change in my life as it’s dictated basically the last year and a half of my life, but I’ve been wanting to for awhile now and this is the push I needed. I won’t let his death be for nothing. Anyways I’m sorry for the long post, I just needed a place to vent and tell my story. R.I.P buddy, I love you. Any support or advice you have would be great, I’ve never experienced anything like this before and I have never fully tried to quit since I’ve started so any help would be appreciated.",8

My husband and I have had a pretty toxic relationship since the first month of us being together. I also fell pregnant the first month we were sleeping together(very dumb I KNOW I wasn’t taking my birth control pills correctly) but anyways... I started being abused emotionally and physically the first month into my pregnancy AND relationship. We both struggled with substance abuse issues, and at the time we both were recently clean and I surprisingly did not relapse at all going through the fucked up shit I was going through at the time... I somehow found strength inside myself I never knew I had, probably due to the baby and the fight or flight mentality..

Anyways flash forward to  6 months into my pregnancy .. I was 24, vulnerable af, my soon to be fiancé proposed to me and I took the bait. I was so afraid of being a single mom of two(I had another child at the time who’s father I was no longer with) and I wanted to do anything I could to show my children some form of stability.. little did I know there would never BE STABILITY as I was about to father a child with the most immature man I’ve ever met. (Self centered, egotistical, narcissistic psychopath)

With every time I was abused, I made excuses for him and believed he would get better because he was good at saying sorry and making up after fights(honey-moon phase ) and the sad part about jt was he was so paranoid and I had no idea what I was doing that could ever make any man, yet alone the man who’s baby I’m carrying, ever put his hands on me like that. I never went through something so horrific in my life in a relationship EVER! My husband played me and made it seem like he was this great guy mr. Perfect !! Went to an Ivy League school, was extremely smart, had $$ ... I was fresh in recovery and so was he, but he didn’t seem like he was anything close as bad as an addict that I was and seemed to have his shit together..

I ignored all of the red flags and married him a year after we had our son

None
Of
It
Stopped.
:(

Oh yeah he quit his job a month after we got married and never got another one. He has a gambling addiction, doesn’t help with the bills. He has done a number on me and my family. Anytime an argument arises.. I do everything I can to avoid him and feeding into the arguments because I don’t want him to fly off the handle. He has stolen from multiple family members of mine, four to be exact.. and I’ve tried to cover for him everytime bc I never wanted my family to think badly of him, ... but my family isn’t stupid and knew it wasn’t me doing these things.. anyways flash forward...

We got married in fall of 2018.. we’ve been together since the end of 2016 and I think I’m finally ready to part ways..

So I was clean for five years and relapsed during the COVID shut down. So did he. He went back on subs and I didn’t. I am trying my best to make something good out of the relapse and never take another sub in my life. $20,000 spent in less than three months. 

I tried getting clean about a month ago and relapsed after 10 days. I took subs for the first three days, and took kratom for 4, then gabapentin 800mg x4 daily there after until I hit ten days and the withdrawals were still SO bad I couldn’t hold out any longer. 

I gave in.

I HAVE to get clean  because in order for me to leave with my son I cannot be using.

Basically, I have been a high functioning oxy/ fentadope addict. I’m a mom, a manager at my job, and I have a lot of responsibilities I HAVE to uphold. 6 years ago I lost custody of my first baby boy due to my addiction and sadly I didn’t get it together for him in time and had to hand over custody to his grandparents. I’m still fighting to get it back. The main reason I have not, is because when my husband quit his job, about six months later we had to move out of our apartment, and back in with his parents. I was paying every single one of our fucking bills for 6 months on my own. Now we have been living with his parents for a year at this point and there hasn’t been any improvement. I’m here for my baby. I can’t afford to live on my own, so when I leave, I have to go back to my parents. 

Idk why I am still here, and why I got married, and why I have let him see me so vulnerable. Why the fuck did I stay? Why did I ever feel so comfortable around him in the first place? He tricked me and made it seem like I needed him.. at the time I definitely felt alone and felt I needed somebody. I had met him going to NA meetings in my town and I was fresh out of a 6 month jail in the county... the only good thing about living at his parents, is the abuse has slowed down  a lot, but not end completely. I feel it has definitely been safer than us living on our own, bc now his parents being around he would never want them to see how ugly his temper can really be(although they have seen it get bad, they just haven’t seen him lay his hands on me .. that only happens when they aren’t home and definitely not anywhere near as often because we literally avoid each other as much as possible. We don’t do anything together anymore. He goes nowhere with me. The most fun we’ve had in the past 2 years was the three month long relapse(which wasn’t even fucking fun okay, it’s never really “fun”) buttttttt——

Okay so after I relapsed at my ten day mark... he didn’t know I relapsed. I kept it a secret. I hid it, well bc since we moved back into his parents... he feels he has this authority over me and our son and basically anytime I try to leave when we’re fighting and I don’t feel safe, he tells me I can’t take our son for one reason or another... before the relapse.. the excuse was, “he lives here this is where all of his stuff is now. You can’t take him, but you can go” another thing was, “I’m home during the day, you have to work, if you take him I’m not watching him for you, good luck!”

Now you can already guess what he tells me now.. “you can’t leave with him because you relapsed and i won’t know if your using or not and I don’t feel he’s safe” 😔😔😔 it’s sad like I tried to keep my slip up to myself. I haven’t fallen short in any of my duties and responsibilities as a parent. I don’t use to get fucked up. I use to avoid the sickness primarily. I do 1-2 bags if that. And I know I sound like every typical addict that sounds so naive, but this same Person was also recently just using and didn’t have any problem until I did it with a friend, and hid it from him, for good reason!! It’s exactly what is was, a relapse, I won’t tip toe around it, but it was a short relapse. I got one bundle, fifteen 30mg oxys... and out of that I have 3 oxys left, and 6 bags, and I have my kratom for when I run out I am doing the kratom detox again. Anyways.. I think this time around I am going to be able to make it though. 

I’ve had time to recognize how unhappy I really fucking am and have had time to distinguish WHY I used again after 5 years.. oh I also didn’t mention it was his brilliant idea for us to stop taking our subs and try to cold turkey at 12mg a day and 3200mg gabapentin a day, by relapsing for a couple months on short acting opiates like oxy.. I know bad idea.. I guess were still impulsive addicts after all right? 

I just really don’t think I can get clean and not relapse being with him anymore. He thinks I want to leave him and continue getting high. I want to leave him and put this part of my life behind me. I want to be on good terms with him, but I’m wasting my life here unhappy. I’ve begged him to work on himself and he won’t. He’s completely let himself go like I don’t feel anything but disgust towards him!!! His parents and family in general are great caring people. I don’t want a war, but I know he is going to make this as hard as possible for me.

He must have realized he can’t control me anymore. I feel like it 100% has always been about control. I am a 27 yr old Sagittarius female. I am not one to be controlled. I clearly had no idea what I was getting myself into. I want to believe he is not really that bad of a person, but he only cares about me when I am telling him I want to leave. Before the fights and the relapse... I’ve asked him to do more eith me, just little things here and there even like go for a walk ! He pays me no mind .. like when I’m not working... I’m the one doing everything eith our son. 

I am wondering if anyone on here can relate in anyway and give me some advice or just simply give me some insight🖤

My BIGGEST concern is him being a spiteful pos telling me I cannot take my son with me if I leave!! If I leave I would be going back to my parents house and stay with them
For a little bit until I can get back on my feet. So if his concern is me relapsing.. I’m still like technically in a “supervised “ setting right?? As I said  before.. I only have 6 bags left... technically I have a bundle and a half all together as far as the D goes, but I’m flushing the other whole bun bc I know in my heart I will be happier once I’m back on my own❕❕❕

I hate myself for staying with this man (more like a boy) for the kids. I was looking for stability, and I got exactly the opposite. He wants the respect that comes with being the man of the house, without actually being the man of the house and handling his shit like a
Man would. Like who puts their wife through hell, then questions why she relapsed behind your back and didn’t want to tell you?!?",6

I was born in California, and me and my family moved to NY when I was barely a year old. My family being my grandparents, their 3 children (my mom and 2 uncles) and myself. My dad was killed before we moved...he was only 16. I wish he was here til this very day, and maybe my life wouldnt be as fucked up as it is. But I cant blame anyone but myself for my actions.

Anyway, I was basically raised by my grandparents up until my younger teens and my grandmother played a very important role in my life. So did my grandfather. Not saying my mother or uncles didnt but my grandparents raised me basically.

I grew up in a small decent town. Always was told I was smart and hung out with the older crowd. Was a quiet kid. I dropped out in 11th grade and got my GED. Why? Dont ask me...a couple of my good friends had dropped out at the time and I think I wanted to follow them. Probably one of the first big mistakes of my life. I dont know why I dropped out, I never failed a grade or anything at that point in life, and actually was blessed to be very smart and could of basically successfully taken any route in life I put my mind to. But instead I dropped out and started running the streets thinking it was cool at the time. Drinking, throwing parties, going to the studio (writing and making music has always been a passion) and just doing reckless teenager shit.

Out of all the friends I had, I was very close to 6 of them. 6 of those friends whom I considered brothers who always had my back as I did theirs. I started smoking weed when I was 16 and drank here and there but at the time weed was my drug of choice...

Right before my 17th birthday I tried some coke, and it became a party drug for me. I would smoke weed everyday, and drink on the weekends doing coke with friends. I was always able to keep some type of income coming in, and moved out when I was about 22 after i met the love of my life who I'm with til this very day. We had got a place in town, and not long after got a car. Life was good.

At this point in time, I started to make decisions I didnt know was going to effect me til this day, 11 years later.
Shortly after, me and her got our own place. I started selling coke to keep some money flowing when I wasnt working. She didnt necessarily approve of it, but the money I was bringing in was good. She also didnt know I was using coke, I always kept it from her because shes a mirror of me. I didnt want to see such a beautiful woman doing that type of shit. Especially the one I loved.

We were living in that place for about 2 years.

One night at the new place me and one of the 6 friends I basically considered a brother were playing dice in my kitchen with my other 5 friends. We'll call him T. Me and T were rolling dice, betting, having a good time......until the stakes got high, and tensions rose. We ended up having some words over a bet, and almost faught. We almost faught because I had him up so high, and he had still owed me $300 I let him borrow the previous week to give his son a good birthday and I just felt he was trying to get over on me. The air got thick, and I brought it up how I felt like he was trying to play me and we ended up arguing resulting in me throwing him out in front of our 5 other good friends. 10 minutes later I started to feel bad (idk why but I have a good heart even when ppl fuck me over) I called him because I was going to apologize and go pick him back up but he didnt answer. Oh well.

2 nights later....

I pulled up to the gas station to grab some gas, at about 1am. As I pulled up to the pump I noticed my mom also pulling in, parking into a parking space further from my car. As she got out and didnt notice I was at the pump I ran over to her as she was about to walk into the store.

""Hey what's up mom, what you doing out this late?""
""Oh hey, I'm just grabbing some cigarettes for tmrw, im almost out""
""Can I use your lighter"" I asked...i wanted to light my blunt i had in the car. 
""Yeah"" she says as she reaches in her pocket, looking towards her car.
""Here just buy one, I think I left mine home, I have to get going""
She handed me a 20 dollar bill and ran to her car and pulled off.
As she was pulling away I'm thinking, what the hell? That was odd.
At that point I knew something was up. But didnt know what. I shook it off.

I got gas, I left the gas station and went home.
I smoked my blunt when I got home and my phone went off...it was one of my licks (someone who was a frequent buyer). She asked if i would trade her a ball for her script of Oxy 10s. At the time I knew those sold just as good, if not better, than the coke. And the script was a 90 count. I sold balls for 150 and I knew I could sell that script for 450 if not more. That wasnt even a question for me. Told her to  bring em, I hooked her up and she she went on her way.

That following weekend I remember coming home, opening my drawer, going into my stash and doing one more line, after a long night of partying. I sat in the kitchen and finished a drink I poured as I tried to come down. I went to bed and tossed and turned, and after a night of coke and ciroc, the room kept spinning and I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went in my cupboard to get some tylenol PM when I seen the oxy bottle. I thought, you know what. I'm gunna pop one of these bad boys, I bet that will get me some sleep. Opened the bottle, slid one out, grabbed some water and swallowed one. I sat in my living room and turned on my ps3, and played COD until I felt the effects.

About 45 minutes into playing, I noticed not only did my comedown come WAY down, I felt good. Really good. Next thing you know its 9am and my girls waking me up on the couch. I had fell asleep with the controller in my hands.

At this point I started using the oxys to come down everytime I sniffed coke. And that was probably 3 times a week.

I got a phone call at about 3am later that week from one of the 6 friends I considered a brother. We're going to call him J.
J called me and was frantic. I could hear in his voice he was scared, very scared. I asked what the hell is wrong man? What's going on???? He says, ""listen me and my girl just got into a big fight. She kicked me out and now I'm walking the streets. I have no where to go and have warrants man please pick me up and let me stay over just for tonight."" I told him without a doubt, went and picked him up and let him stay in my studio.
(I had put about 7,000 towards a home studio which I had a room dedicated to which also had a twin bed off to the corner.)

Me and him went into the studio, talked about his problems, I tried to ease him, we smoked and I went to bed.

The next day I got up, went in the studio, and he was gone. I picked up the phone dialed his number, and he answered.

 ""Where did you go??"" I asked.

""I had one of these guys I know picked me up to get a couple things from my house but I'm on my way back right now, he wants to know if he can buy a ball"" he says.

""I dont know him bro, you know how we get down, I mean if you trust him, you can give it to him and just pay me but I dont know him"" I said.

""Ok I'm on the way"" he replied.
10 minutes later he shows up, I look out the window and theres like 3 ppl in the car. He got out by himself, came upstairs, I give him the ball, he gives me the money and he goes straight into the bathroom. 5 minutes go by, I knock on the bathroom door, ask if hes alright, ""yeah coming out now "" he replied. He dapped me up coming out of the bathroom, said hed be back, and left....
I didnt hear from him all day.

That night I picked my girl up from work at 11pm.
I pulled into my driveway, we both came upstairs.
""SHIT"" my girl says.
""I still have the keys for the med box on me, I need to go back and drop them off for the next shift, I'm not supposed to bring them home""
I gave her the car keys and she bolted out the door in a rush
""Be right back babe"" she says.
Not even 30 seconds after she walked out the door, there was a knock....

Not even thinking to check out the window to see who it was, I figured it was her to run back in and grab her cellphone she had forgotten, so I unlocked the dead bolt and opened the door.
Boy was I wrong....

As I opened the door, all I could remember was staring into a set of eyes behind a ski mask as he quickly began to choke me. He choked me until I literally couldnt breathe and threw me backwards, into my glass coffee table. As I laid there in broken glass, I tried to get up as quick as I can as he went for the door to shut and lock it back up when he turned around and grabbed me. We wrestled around for a couple seconds in glass and he gained a full mount on top of me, choking me again. He was saying ""dont try anything stupid or you're dead, pulled out a machete and put it to my throat. As I sat there bleeding from the glass, sweating, breathing as hard as I ever did, I stared in his as and nodded my head yes. At this point I knew I was going to die if I kept trying to fight back. So I started to comply. Remind you, I'm in sweats, my gun is under my couch cushion, and all I'm thinking is ""just work with him, get him calm, and go for the gun"". As I shook my head to imply I'm surrendering, he says, ""I just want the coke. Give me the coke and I wont kill you"" ""where is it"" he says, as hes looking towards the kitchen as if he knew it was somewhere in there. He put the machete back to my throat and says ""sit Indian style with your hands behind your back"" at this point I knew he was going to kill me, and the way he looked in the kitchen where the coke was, I thought this was someone that already knew where it was. I didnt recognize his voice, so I'm thinking someone tipped him off and this was a set up.

As soon as he ordered me to sit Indian style with my hands behind my back, I got up as quick as I could and went for my gun.

We started wrestling again.

He was much stronger than I was, and after a couple blows as he gained control, he was back in the dominant position. He told me to get on my stomach as he took his machete and put it to the back of my head as he started flipping my couch cushion. He found the gun, grabbed it, and started laughing. He cocks it back, made sure one was in the chamber, and goes ""if you try some silly shit like that again I'll blow your head off. Now stay still""

As I laid there on my stomach, he started opening closets. The second one he opened was in the hallway where I kept my towels and other miscellaneous crap. He grabbed a towel, and some clear masking tape I had in there, used his machete to cut the towel in half vertically, tied my hands behind my back, along with with my feet, all together, in a hog tie sort of style and dragged me to the kitchen. At this point I thought I was done. In my head I'm saying my prayers and started to tear up. This was my last night of my life I'm thinking.
 He found the coke, did a giant line in front of me, and put the rest in his pocket. About $800 worth I had left that he took. He then proceeded to drag me into my bedroom and started going through the closet and all my drawers. I just sat there, tied up in silence. He found a few more hundred dollars I had in the drawer along with mine and my girls ID. He knelt down and shoved my girls ID in my face. 

""Do you wanna see her ever again?"" He yells.

I yelled, ""please, just go man, you got what you came here for""

He replies, ""if she shows up right now, you know I have no choice but to kill the both of you right?""

""Just go man, please"" I uttered. Knowing her job was only 5 minutes away, and about 15 minutes had passed, I knew she was bound to show up at any second.

""PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU TO JUST LEAVE DUDE"" I implied, still hogtied, bloody, and shaking.

""I want you to count to 60, and do not get up until you count to 60. I wanna hear you count out loud. If you try any funny shit you're dead.""

""Ok, ok"" I replied.

He ran out the room as I started to count. As I got to 20, I started to get up and tried to untied myself as I was still counting when he ran back into the room suddenly and boom.....

I woke up to my girlfriend on top of me sobbing, screaming, ""WAKE UP PLEASE!!!!"" Slapping me.

I'm disoriented. Everything's a blur.
As I started to come to, my girlfriend was balling her eyes out. She started hugging me, asking me frantically what had happened. I noticed my left eye was swollen shut. My glasses were gone. And I had a lump on my temple the size of a golf ball.

He hit me, I thought to myself.

He must have hit me with something other than his fist with the damage I had to the side of my face.

""Thank you"" I kept repeating to my girlfriend. ""Thank you baby"".
She looked at me confused as hell and says, ""for what?!? What the hell happened ?!?""

""Thank you for not coming home when that happened. I just got set up and if you would of walked in that door, we both would of had a bullet with our name on it with my own gun."" I said.

I explained to her what had happened and we both decided to leave that night. Not knowing who, how or what necessarily just happened I was confused. I needed to get away and think straight.

Who did this to me? Who set me up? Why would this happen, I try to show everyone extra love with all my power who the hell would do this to me?

I had a couple things in mind, a couple people on my radar as you might have had as well reading this, but I didnt know for certain. I had to do some digging.

That night we packed and left to stay with my uncle until we could find another place.

I got a phone call not long after this had happened and it wasnt good. My grandmother....she was sick. My mom had called me and told me we were all going to her drs appointment the next day because shes getting tested and stuff for cancer.

Oh my god.
Cancer.
I immediately started praying in tears.

The next day the family went to the hospital with her.
Impatiently waiting in that room beside her bed with my mother and grandfather, as the doctor came back in. The look on his face told it all. I let out a yell from deep inside of me.

""NO, PLEASE TELL ME NO"" I yelled. 

""I'm sorry"" the doctor says. ""The mass in your lungs, is cancer'

My grandfather let out a scream I've never heard before.
""Jesus christ, please tell me different "" he says
My mother started crying her eyes out.
I couldnt believe it.
I look over at my grandmother and she was staring at the ceiling. Calm. Her eyes started to water as she looked over at us, and says ""it's okay, please stop crying, its ok""
Growing up, my grandmother has always been the strongest person I knew. And she was the calmest one in the room at that very moment.

As time went on, I moved into my grandparents and vouched to take care of her, as her health deteriorated over time, and eventually got put on hospice.

I will never forget the day she went. She was very sick that day. Kept going in and out of it, and wasnt acting normal at all. I called my mother and told her. My mother rushed over along with my uncles and sisters, and as soon as everyone sat in the living room with my grandmother in her recliner, she put her head down and passed. It's as if she was waiting for everyone to get there to go. As she put her head down the room filled with this unexplainable air. Everyone started crying, as I walked over to her, kissed her on the forehead and told her I loved her and grabbed her hand and couldnt let go as my eyes are pouring tears.

I will always remember the night before she passed. I kept a baby monitor in my room and one in hers, everytime I heard her at night struggling or anything out of the ordinary I would rush to her room and make sure she was ok. The night before she passed, I'm laying in bed and I heard her over the monitor trying her all to say something. I rushed into her room and asked if everything was okay. She looked at me and struggled to get enough air in her lungs to say, ""i.....love....you...very....much.....thank....you....baby"" I grabbed her hand and tried not to cry and told her, ""dont thank me grandma, that's what I'm here for. To make sure you're okay"" she smiled and gripped my hand tight. I kissed her on the forehead and told her I loved her. Not knowing she was going to pass that next day.

This is starting to get very hard for me to write so I'm going to wrap it up.

Basically the night I seen my mom at the gas station and she was acting weird...well I found out she was with T. Yeah, the T I called my brother growing up. I think he felt some type of way the night we fought in front of our friends, or maybe he felt embarrassed. Embarrassed to the point where he wanted revenge. They got together and are still together til this day. I beat myself up time and time again, always remembering that night we were rolling dice betting, and always say to myself, damn it, why cant you ever be more humble with people. Especially your friends, it didnt have to go down like that and you didnt have to kick him out and embarrass him in front of everyone. It's something I beat myself up about everyday. The way I get with people when I feel betrayed.

Today I have major trust issues and always have my guard up. I tend to not let anyone in anymore.

Oh....and The guy who ran up in my house....I got set up by J. My other boy I called ""brother"". I guess the day I called him after he left when he said he had a lick, that's who it was for. It was for the guy that took my pride and robbed me in my own house. The guy that ran up in my house and tied me up.

Remember when I said J went into the bathroom after i gave him the coke that day? Well he went in there to cut it. He cut the ball so bad, it was basically all fake when he went and served the guy up, and the guy pressed J about it, and J told him everything; Where my coke was, what my girls work schedule was like, etc., so this guy can plot on me and come at the right time when I was alone. He was outside the whole time waiting for me to get back home that night and when my girl left, that was his opportunity. 

I'm trying to go into as much detail as I can but this is not only a struggle to write about, but is getting long and I want this to be read. I need help.

I basically turned to what i knew at the time made me feel best, and those were the oxys. I really started abusing them until it came to the point where I either couldn't find them anymore or they were too expensive and at this point I'm withdrawaling. At which point I started sniffing heroin, and now i have a powder fentanyl habit that's high as the sky. Each and every time I get high, thinking and grieving. Wishing I could turn back time.

I can say a few things tho. Thank god I'm terrified, literally terrified of needles or i probably would have shot up a long time ago. And I thank god I'm still alive. Out of the past few years of me sniffing fentanyl, I overdosed 1 time, and if it wasnt for my girl hearing me fall on the kitchen floor at midnight waking her, I would of died on that floor that night. They had to bring me back to life that night.

I've pushed the little family I have away over this bullshit, and my life is in shambles. I've considered suicide a few times in my life throughout this hell journey but never had the balls to do it and always remind myself I'm better than this.






Today I'm currently laying down in my room in rehab. I'm 20 days clean, for the first time since I started popping oxys 5years ago. But it's hard. Very hard. I dont know what to do when I get out and I'm scared. Any words of motivation or advice would be appreciated. I know this was a long one and it was very hard to write and this probably wont get read because its so long, and probably isn't even 35% of what I've gone through in my life, but I just want to open up about this. Something I've never done as a quiet humble person. I'd need to write a book if I wrote about everything. Things that movies are made from. I'm still alive and I know it's for a reason.

If you got this far, thank you for taking the time to at least read about some of my journey and any words of advice, courage, or wisdom will be much appreciated. I lost everyone, and the only one helping me til this day is my girl and my mom. Everyone else that truly cared I pushed away during this time.

I'm lost and just want my life back. I know I'm better than this but I'm losing hope by the day.",7

From what I understand loperamide only attaches to intestinal opiate receptors.  I was taking 50 pills a day at first, but I'm down to just 16 pills once a day.  

Also, is jumping off from 16 a day the same as maybe jumping off from 6 a day?  I mean, I'll probably have a day or 2 at least of puking and shitting myself, but it can't be as bad as jumping off 1g/day of strong fent mix.  But is there a low amount of imodium to jump off where I'll just be nauseous and not puke?  I know everyone is different.  I actually got my opiate script originally for undiagnosable stomach pain, so my intestinal withdrawal is fucking awful.  Jumping off fent I puke 7 days straight at least, which is why I could never make it through. 

I'm about a month off fent.  I know I'm still on an opiate, but I feel like I went through the mental w/d already - crying all the time, ect.  I still have zero energy even on 16 imodium pills a day.  I got 1 month left to get clean entirely.",1

I used to post here about 7 years ago desperately trying to get clean with a different account that is no longer valid.... well heres an update

So i got hooked on pills at about 22 years old. Everyone i loved was dyingnand i didnt know how to cope so i hust crushed a pill... then i was smoking them... eventually a so called friend showed me i could stay well longer by doing heroin instead. I went off the rails, dropped out of school, gave up on my music and started selling and doing drugs full time with numerous arrests and jail stints. At about 28 i got the big arrest. They found my full stash and the cash and the scales. I was looking at a 15 year prison term for trafficking. Thats when i started posting here. I wanted so bad to get clean not just for me but in hopes of a kighter sentence... i knew i lucked out to make bail so something inside me hoped getting clean would help them go light on me. For two years i fought my case, delaying it by technicality or siging up for treatment the day before court and just bot going to treatment. The one putpatient i actually went to i mastered the amount to do so he would think i was finally getting clean. 2 months before my 30th birthday the judge had had enough and told me i wasnt leaving court without settling the case. I had a moment of clarity and begged for a leaner sentence promising i would use the time to better myself and stay clean when i got out. He agreed to 3 years at halftime so i would do a year and a half with good time and even gave me 2 months to get my affairs together. I immediately went home and tried to kill myself by taking everything i had at once. I vividly remember the dream i had that night. Theres was a little demon who was giving me a tour and showing me my ""new home"" the dream was abnormally long and i even realized i wasnt awake but it felt more real then a dream should. I asked him to show me a mountain that i could see in the distance and he got really angry with me like almost attacking me. I decided to go on my own and he followed me snarling and screaming at me that we had better things to see.  I started to notice the backdrop was fake and this seemingly nice place was all a facade and realized he was distracting me so i started running towards the mountain. I immediately felt a tug from behind and noticed the whole time i had been chained up to something i couldnt see so i kept struggling  to break free as he got more and more angry. One by one i felt threads breaking behind me until eventually the last one did and i woke up. I felt like i hadnt been breathing and immediately checked the mirror to see my face had turned blue.

4/20/2016 was the day i turned myself in. I finished 4 treatment programs while locked up andwas released on 9/2/2017. Ive stayed clean since that day. Ive started a career where i make almost 25 an hour, i have 2 cars and my own place i share with my cat ive had for ten years. In 2 and a half weeks i discharge from parole and can finally put this all behind me.

To anyone here that is struggling. Its hard but not impossible and youre worth it and you deserve a good life. I send all my love to anyone who needs and wants to get or stay clean.",14
2020-08-15 03:59:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ia3j40/my_experience_with_sublocade_back_on_the_shot/,My experience with Sublocade - back on the shot,"I made the tough decision to get myself back on Suboxone (actually, the Sublocade shot, to be specific). I didn't relapse or anything, but I started having some other unrelated medical issues and I've been very anxious/uncertain about finding a job in my field due to COVID. I found that battling the cravings and dealing with the other stuff was making it so I couldn't take care of my day-to-day responsibilities like I should be.

Honestly, I don't think I was too close to relapsing, but I was closer than I felt comfortable with. And the cravings I started having scared me. Even though I believe I could have stayed clean, my life is so much better now that I didn't dare risk losing everything. I have 3 years clean (including my time on Suboxone, Sublocade, and nothing)  and I know that by the time you get in the car to score, you've likely already been ignoring the internal warnings for weeks. I had what may or may not have been an internal warning. 

I admit, I had mixed feelings about going back on it, but I think I made the safe and smart decision. 

Anyway, I've noticed that a ton of people on this sub and some of our sister subs have been asking about the Sublocade shot, I thought I would just post some of my observations and opinions on this particular medication.

Please note, I'm not a doctor and this is not medical advice in any way. I'm a recovering addict, that's all.

**The Good**

Overall, I think Sublocade is incredible and it's probably the closest thing to a ""cure"" that we have right now. It's much smoother than the Suboxone strips. I feel the same all day rather than having that end-of-day/next morning slump. I don't feel sick or high or strange. I just feel sober and normal from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed.

Another good thing is not worrying about having my script lost/stolen/delayed every month. My insurance likes to play a game where they randomly make me jump through hoops to get the same exact medication I've already been taking for months. Now they can take their sweet time because the shot lasts far longer than a month. 

I find that my mood and emotions are far more stable on the shot - almost to a fault, which I will explain below. I'm able to maintain a fairly calm demeanor, whereas normally I experience slightly more intense emotions and am perhaps more excitable than the average person due to ADHD.

Also,
zero cravings. This is a big one. On the strips I had very few cravings/dreams of getting high. Almost none. On the shot I have none.

**The Bad**

Constipation. I have to take fiber or use a laxative. This part is worse than the strips.

Pain. Those 10 seconds when they are actually injecting you with the shot are torture. But hey, it's only 10 seconds. Worth it.

Mid-day drowsiness. I find that getting my full 8 hours gets rid of this. Seriously, I can't even push it for a single night and get 7 hours or I find myself tired for a bit in the early afternoon. Still, coffee fixes this and it's not major. 

Emotional range is slightly stunted for sure. This is good and bad. While I can only get 75% sad or upset (which is good for me), I can also only get 75% happy or excited. Oh, and I am unable to cry. Seriously, *Marley and Me* followed by *Titanic* couldn't make me cry right now.

**Other**

I see people asking about the process of getting on the shot. Talk to your doctor/rehab. In my case, they had me take strips up to the morning of the shot, no gap or delay between switching from the strips to the shot either.

And yes, just like the strips, this shot will cause precipitated withdrawal if you take it shortly after using. 

I think that about sums up the major points. The other thing I wanted to mention is that the vast majority of people I see online are saying that there is little to no withdrawal after quitting the shot cold turkey. When I had stopped taking it previously, I also did not experience withdrawal as far as I can tell, although I did have some joint pain in my hands and feet and I still don't quite know if that is related or if it's something else entirely.

Tl;Dr my personal experience has been that the shot is 100x better than the strips in nearly every way (except constipation level). No regrets. Would use as safety net again with no second thought.",19

Is there any long term recovering opiate addicts out there that have maintained long term sobriety for many years and just started having cravings. Is this normal?  

 Now I know that COVID and having to be home with my 4 children 24/7, one being my adorable 10mo old :) and not working anymore does have a lot to do with it.  Up until a year ago I worked full time and have since i was a kid but now my fiance is only one working bc hes essential during covid. Tell u all the truth I am bored out of my mind and completely stressed out, overwhelmed. Normally I find the joy in life. I'm happy, easygoing, positive, and rarely have cravings. For months now I'm tired, depressed, I want to isolate and I just feel irritable and the list goes on. To be blunt the addict that seemed to be long gone has reared its ugly head. Im craving pain killers. And yes... i also kno this shows I need to get back into groups like celebrate recovery which is like a Christian aa or na  and i need to be more involved in community. It sucks rn bc of social distancing and not much is open rn. I know wat I need to do lol but it would be nice to talk to this community here. Anyone who understands.  I'm wondering if this is one of those milestone cravings that I hear about Has anyone else experienced this please let me know open a discussion.

Thankuuu",8

No shit, but still, it made me think. Don’t get me wrong there’s folks living with cancer and degenerative bone diseases and kids born with cerebral palsy or low functioning autism who will never know so many of life’s most basic pleasures, yet somehow having that crossed wire that makes us addicts seems a special kind of cruel. Maybe it’s the lack of empathy we get, after all it’s our own fault right? Maybe it’s because none of those other ailments leave the same kind of stain on your soul that no amount of meditation apps or na meetings could ever really scrub clean. One day your leaving the dentist with a script for a dozen Vicodin, next thing you know it’s ten years later and you’re in a jail cell or psych unit with a dripping abscess, and ruined credit, hoping Walmarts loss prevention doesn’t show up to the court date while punching yourself in the legs and praying you didn’t catch hepatitis, or something worse. Meanwhile the next guy the dentist saw all those years ago took the same pill, got an itchy nose and went on with their life never giving it a second thought. Sometimes I wonder how society progressed this far in a world where heroin exists. How are we not all lying in a field somewhere in the Middle East with a nice nod having never progressed beyond grass huts? It certainly stunted my progression in its tracks.

He can get dope all day everyday. I’m at a fork in the road.","The obvious best option would be to block him from being able to contact me. I know I need to do this, but damn! It seems so hard to throw away this connect. Last time I went out (October 2019) I couldn’t find opiates to save my life. I tried and tried, but my higher power must have been looking out. I did end up doing a bunch of blow, meth, adderall, xans, drinking. I decided to quit digging and go to treatment and have been clean for my longest streak ever. My life is beautiful. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. I’m blessed in so many ways, and this is only the beginning if I stay clean. 

The terrible, stupid option would be to keep the channel for communication open. Im 25 and a woman, he’s 32 and has been attracted to me since we first met years ago. So he does want to hang out and he even offered to take me shopping. Old me wouldn’t even question it. I have a tendency to use men. He stated that he would never pressure me to do drugs or have them out in front of me. Doesn’t matter, i know he would give them to me if I decided I want to use, in which case I’d be fucked. I’ve always had this Bonnie and Clyde fantasy that ties into my addiction, wherein we (me and hot junkie) do dumb shit and destroy ourselves together. It’s the dark side that lies dormant within me that’s drawn to piece of shit dudes, and being a piece of shit. 

This is a test. My first real test, honestly. It’s so fucking hard to just block him. I know his motives aren’t good. He’s definitely not doing me any favors. Will I really even consider throwing away all my hard work for an artificial dose of pleasure? To go back to chasing the dragon? To go back to wanting to die?

I was on vivitrol years ago and I know you had to be 72 hours clean or it would send you into reciprocating withdrawals. Which I though was because of the naloxone.

I've been in and out of this shit for too long at this point, but anyways i'm ready to get off this shit again, but I've never used subs in a short term detox. i was just wondering how long is too long to take it? i don't wanna use the subs to get off the dope and end up just dependent on the subs. I've been through those WDs and never again. So far my plan is

Day 1: 4 mg

Day 2: 2 mg

Day 3: 1 mg

Day 4: .5 mg

Day 5 : .25 mg

still debating if i should even go down to .25 on day 5 or just say fuck it and not take it and just stop after day 4, I don't know, as i said I've never done this at home. I've always either been to treatment or detox and the few times I've gotten off at home i just used a bunch of kratom and weed and that really didn't last too long. hahaha I just wanted to know what ya'll thought and what's yalls experience with this! anything will be greatly appreciated, thank you

&#x200B;

Edit: sorry for the word vomit title. It's late and i'm not all here rn lol

Edit 2: after talking to some irl friends and others I think I'm gonna go 

Day 1: 4 mg

Day 2: 4 mg

Day 3: 2 mg

Day 4: 2 mg

Day 5 : 1 mg

Day 6: .50 mg 

Day 7: .25 Mg

and if needed i'll take another .25 the 8th day, but i'm really hoping and trying to not take it any longer than 7 days. I was trying to go less days due to just my history with it and how much i hate subs, but I also just wanna get through this so fuck it!",3

I seeked professional help on July 21st. and Ive been on Suboxone ever since. But 10 days ago I tested positive for COVID. The first symptom I showed was joint pain, and at first i thought i was having withdrawals symptoms so im like WTF how! Then i got a huge fever so Im like nah this isnt withdrawals this is something else! Then my mom (she doesnt know about any of this) shes like woah you might have the virus. Im like oh crap, I got tested the next day and bam positive. So I was severely sick for 9 days, but the worst part was me having to quarantine, I didn't think being alone at home wouldve made me relapse! So 2-3 days ago I just got so bored and went to my dealer but he didnt have, so I went 2 blocks down and got a 10mg percocet from someone ive never bought from before. So I take it then i saw on google that I wasnt going to feel the high, so I was relieved because i Honestly dont want to rememeber that euphoria that ruined my life. But then all of a sudden i start tripping! I start hearing my own voice, I felt so confused, i felt like i was under water, my breathing was slower, my finger tips were cold and tingly. So i took a nap and woke up completely normal! Thank GOD! Does any one know what I might have intaken? It was definitely a fake oxy. But im wondering what it actually was. Never again man. Its like God punished me for messing up. But that was the only time I messed up. I feel so guilty for relapsing.

Also this isnt important but just wanted to let this out. Im in a relationship of 13 years, we met at 15 y.o. He's a police officer and my biggest fear throughout my addiction was him finding out. He did about 3 months ago, IDK how but he did. but I am trying to fix things. Now every time I go out and take more than 30 min. outside, when I come back home he grills me, gives me an attitude, or ignores me. I figured out is that he thinks I am still using. He doesnt know i got professional help and that i am on Suboxone, he thinks im just seeing a therapist for depression. Idk why but i cant bring myself to tell him im on suboxone. I feel like he'll again compare me to people he deals with at work daily. BTW he was not supportive whatsoever when he found out about my percocet addiction, he judged me and made me feel like shit. And now being clean I feel like I have to constantly prove to him were I am at by sending him pics or FT'ming him. He doesnt ask at all for me to do this. But i feel like I have to just so I wont get an attitude from him, so I do all of that. But I think he knows Im not using (he doesnt ask). Anyways just felt like I wanted to vent a little. How did you fix your relationship with your loved ones? But being sober has just made me realize so much and just wish I can take it all back.",2

I am a manager at my job and relapsed a couple months ago when I was laid off due to COVID. Fml. I was on subs for 5 years and just stopped taking them. What are you supposed to do when you can detox on your own, but can’t get past the detox meds of choice? (Did kratom and subs each one for four days; all together a total of 8 days) and I made it two or three days no detox meds besides a high dose of gabapentin and it barely touched the withdrawal I was still having. No energy, chills, cold, hot... only thing I DIDNT have was restless legs by day 8 let’s put it that way. I’ve been to detox/ rehab so many times. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY in my life would understand how I went and relapsed again. They don’t understand how the addict mind works. Subs gave me a false sense of security in which I really thought I could make it out of this unscathed. I planned to relapse, but no more than 2 months. I was only going to stick to thirties, but wound up doing dope the past months bc thirties in philly are going anywhere from $50-70 a piece it’s insane. I can’t do this anymore. I just want to not get stuck on one thing. I am searching for anyone, any doctor, any psych, any program that helps ppl like me that can’t go to inpatient. I need help, but I can’t leave my family and my job. I just need a doctor to know what’s going on with me if nobody else. The shit they have in Kensington is killing ppl left and right. It’s actually scary to be stuck on something like the fentadope that’s going around these days. Also with an ungodly amount of tranq. At least five years ago there was still heroin in dope... nowadays it’s just not there. 

Seriously looking for anyone that can help point me in the right direction to somewhere , preferably east coast wise, that could help me get a doctor to help me without doing inpatient. I am open to intensive outpatient, but I believe they only take you if you have gone through detox already.

Edit: NO im not looking for a doctor for any maintenance. Ive been on suboxone for the past 5 years and never want it again. Im talking about a doctor of some sort, possibly outpTient, that can help me get clean without inpAtient rehab where i have to leave All of ny responsibilities.",3

It very much did help. Gave me that short term sub energy boost which tells me I was in heavier withdrawal.

I just took 2mg more at my 72 hour mark. Hoping tomorrow I can go 1mg then next day 1mg. And be done. I have 6mg left total so some extra.

My main issue in life is my anxiety. I tend to always have access to benzos and I've NEVER found them addictive. I've had them my whole life and never liked them. But my anxiety nuked during covid so I fell to opiates all over again. My doc won't increase or adjust quantity of my clonazepam without messing with my antidepressant which has enough side effects already. 

With that said in a few days I can get my clonazepam refilled. 30 x 0.5mg (rapid dissolve, tasty). I am also trying to get Xanax as clonazepam is more active in the back of my mind. At 0.5 or 1mg it acts more of a background drug that shortens my anxiety. Don't really notice it or feel high. 

The Xanax idea is to help more rapid acting because my anxiety is very high so my fear is that I'll get more panic attacks over next few days of mental withdrawal. 

Ideas? I need something to quiet my nerves during day working. 

I work at home due to covid. I try to have a distraction on like Netflix. Almost constantly something playing. Quietness gets to me real fast. I can't really walk away from my computer for more than 7 minutes. My job is more reactive. When I had anxiety at work I would go outside and walk the giant parking lot for 5 minutes. Didn't really help tho. 

Yes aware of benzo addiction. However I have had Ativan, Xanax, clonazepam throughout my life and never got addicted. I've even tried to find out why they are addictive. Never had a problem. Literally don't get why people are addicted to them.",1

My work buddy and I are like brothers. We have been friends for over a year and our recovery dates were very close, so we were constantly cheering each other on. We had a very strong emotional bond and a sense of protection for one another. 
I am a recovering alcoholic, he is a recovering heroin addict. While in some ways our addictions are similar, at that same time they are vastly different. 
He relapsed mid March. He shut down and stopped communicating with most people, including his girlfriend. I would reach out from time to time, sometimes he would answer, sometimes he wouldn’t. I wanted to give him space and not overwhelm him. At this point though, I’m doing check-ins more frequently with him to see how he’s feeling or just to say hey, even if I don’t get a response. 

Yesterday was our first work shift back together since the lockdown. He lost a lot of weight and muscle. He was very pale and his pupils were very small. He just wasn’t really THERE. 
At the end of our shift I walked him to his car to chat. I asked him how he was really feeling, and he said it was bad. He said he didn’t know what to do or how to stop; that if he doesn’t use he gets so nauseous. He doesn’t have insurance. He said he is trying to look for Suboxone but doesn’t know where to get it. If his mom finds out, she’s kicking him out and he’ll be homeless.
I listened to everything he had to say. I told him I love him, that I support him whether he’s clean or not. That he has so many people that care about him; and to reach out and use those resources, even if that means just saying “I’m having a really hard time.” We cried together. 

I’m in that state of helplessness, and “savior mode.” My own brother passed of a heroin overdose 1.5 years ago. Our relationship was rocky and I had pulled away for years because I was scared. When he died our relationship was non existent, and I still carry that guilt with me. I want to do things right this time. I’ve been doing so much research on heroin addiction and everything that goes with it. 

What are more ways I can support him? I feel like getting him out of the house (at least continuing to encourage him to go out with me) would be a good first step? He was very into exercise after he got clean, and I’ve read that’s really beneficial for the mind. I want to do more research on ways to get treatment when you do not have insurance. I don’t want to say the wrong thing; I think I’ve been doing a good job with that, and I want to keep it that way. 

How would you best want someone to support you??

My moods are over the place and most days end with crying myself to sleep. I'm glad I can cry again though, and compared to previous attempts this has been relatively easy with minimal cravings. 

One thing, though: I'm still constipated and feel feverish without real fever when my anxiety is through the roof. All my aches and back pain are amplified too. Is this common 3+ weeks in after coming off a low dose albeit one I used for years daily? The pain isn't intolerable but prevents me from sleeping enough and exercising, and pretty much doing anything that involves long walks or the usual rest type activity. Had to cancel band rehearsals today too as I can't sit on a drummer's throne at the moment.  

I haven't been completely sober, I have some prescription Valium and zopiclone for the nights and a little bit of weed too, but opiate and alcohol free. Tried pregabalin and found it to be a bit too effective anxiety and pain-wise & made me feel like I was drunk without drinking anything. Gave me a strange hangover-like state the day after. Yuck.

I am also recovering from a serious burnout and have been depressed for years, so I know some of this comes from those.

I just want to get opiates to end this. But I know it is just a restart. I don't have local connections. I use dark net so it would take a few days to get here so no matter what I won't get anything anytime soon.",2

The first few days felt like hell, but I’m almost thru day five and I’m feeling great.  I’m very fortunate that this hospital has set me up with a methadone clinic for when I get out of here. Unfortunately I have to stay an extra night so the hospital can dose me in the morning because I can’t get in the clinic until Wednesday. But still feeling very grateful and coming to terms with my sobriety. 

Unfortunately in April my father passed away but in a weird way it feels like he guided me here. Idk if that sounds crazy but i really think he did. I just kept thinking how happy he must be to be seeing me get help and into recovery and it’s gotten me this far.

Without music, no idea where I would be. It has been so instrumental in my recovery, pun intended. 

I pop on the AirPods/headphones and venture over to SoundCloud or Prime Music. I pick a new genre every morning and just let it play for hours. 

Music allows time to move faster, feelings to build, nostalgia to run through the brain, and sends rockets of happiness to my brain when a great song comes on.

Luckily Covid has me working at home, no way I could manage the drive to the office. I have previously come off Amitriptilyne and the lack of sleep was similar but not the body pain codeine WD is causing. I have done cold turkey from codeine before for similar reasons but dont remember it being this bad.  Guess at 56 I dont bounce back so well now

Anyway , I am reassured by the posts saying day 4 is the worst for most people. Anyone in the same position has a big bag of empathy from me.

2020-08-10 08:17:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/i73qr2/one_year_today/,One year today,"Today is my clean date.            
          
I used for about a decade, pretty much nonstop. This time, the only thing I did different, I actually went to rehab. I had gone to detox twice before, but only stayed the 6 or 7 days to get through w/d. This time i went to ""residential"" after detox. I planned on staying for the month long program, but I ended up staying for 98 days or something crazy.               
             
I transitioned from rehab to a sober house, and I'm still here. I love it here. My sober house is very laid back. It's not staffed. It's basically an apartment with extra rules. I get urine screened at random, there is a zero tolerance policy here. Curfew is at 11 during the week, midnite on weekends. Unless I'm at work, I can come home whenever. I can ""sleep out"" if I want, just give prior notice. I have my own room. My PS4 and guitar is here. My truck's parked outside. And I go work when it's available. They used to require 4 meetings a week, but now, with COVID putting the kibosh on a lot of meetings, we host our own, mon/wed/fri.             
            
Churches are starting to open up, so they're talking about going back to outside meetings again. At first, I didnt mind. I was actually kind of relieved. But now that it's been a while, i kind of miss going to meetings. I know they're not for everybody, and I still cannot do the ""god,"" part. But NA is much less saturated with it. And for me, it's not about the literature. It's more about connecting with people, having some accountability, and hearing a message of hope. And who knows, maybe I can help a newcomer. Even if i just give them a ride home.            
             
I really love it here. The rent is cheap. And even though I'm working way less, I have more money than I have *ever* had in my life. It is a good feeling. I still dont take anything for granted. I'm grateful for the roof over my head, the food in my fridge, my truck outside and the gas I can put in it. I'm grateful I can pay the insurance, and not have to worry about driving with stolen fucking license plates, or an expired DL. Grateful for the people I live with and my mending relationships with family.               
            
I don't take any of it for granted. Because I'm not special. I know I'm one bad decision away from being back in detox, or prison, or homeless again. I don't miss any of it.             
           
For those of you that this matters to, no I'm not on MATs. No methadone or suboxone or anything. I have nothing against MATs. If it keeps you off the streets and away from hard use, then please, just dont abuse it. I've tried suboxone maintenance in the past, and it wasn't for me. I still drank like a fish, and ended up using in between doctor visits. It ended up being my ""emergency back-up drug.""                 
        
              
I guess I don't have some profound message for everybody.  I was pretty hopeless. I was homeless and suicidal, I didn't think there was a way out.

The subutex taper was much easier than suboxone taper I don’t know why that is but it definitely is. I think the most helpful part of getting through this is keeping busy.

My story...,"A couple years ago while I was traveling in Europe (for several weeks), I realized hadn’t packed enough “meds” to get me through my entire trip. I panicked as I came close to my last dose! Can you imagine?? At one point I left my party and went searching for pharmacies in hopes that I could find some type of legalized opiate in Europe (unaware of the European regulations), I found nothing! I was out of luck and I knew that I just had to fucking deal with it. 

The next few days the strangest thing happened....I believe that due to the fact I was on a trip, and we were doing so many outings, somehow the chemical dopamine must’ve been replaced by naturally increased endorphins and dopamine(?). Because I DID NOT go through acute withdrawal. I had mild chills, sweats, etc., but nothing that I couldn’t manage. I finished my trip about 6 days or so totally sober. I do recall being a bit uncomfortable on the 13 hour flight back to the States. But there you have it! as soon as the distractions were gone so was my mindset. 

I returned home and stared again. Which is so unfortunate bc I shockingly made it though with very little discomfort. Mind you, It wasn’t a total cake walk. I was sweating, a bit achy, sneezing, and fatigued, but nothing I couldn’t “hide”
from my group. Those are physical symptoms. 

What I was able to sustain during this trip was my mindset! Which, in my opinion is the worst part WD. The mind can pull us through or the mind can completely consume us with overwhelming fear, anxiety, negative thoughts, pain, etc. 

The reason I am sharing this story is that perhaps distracting the mind can be a form of recovery? Getting out and doing exciting things with other humans. Distract the mind while the body heals. The mind is so powerful and I’m interested to learn more about it. 

I was in utter shock that I didn’t have intense and dreadful acute withdrawal symptoms. 10+ year user, btw. I by no means mean to offend anyone either. I don’t take this lightly. I know how terrible and impossible it seems and I wouldn’t believe it if it were not my personal experience. 

I WISH I could go back in time and utilize that  opportunity I had to stay completely sober. But I can’t, and I’m back to square one feeling like I need help. 

Has anyone had an experiences similar to mine?

Can anyone explain how these type of distractions (psychologically or even spiritually) alter your mind even in the worst anticipated illnesses??",3

I have a really good friend who has been sober from roxys and heroin for the last year (as far as I know). He comes down to visit from Arkansas and stays with me a few days every now and then to catch up with some hometown friends and bullshit around. Well lately I think he’s been using again, and the worst part is I think it’s even in my house. But I can’t confirm 100% and I don’t want to accuse anyone of something they didn’t do, especially a close friend. I notice the itching and the mispronunciation of words every now and then but that’s all. The part that made me very suspicious is when he went to the bathroom for 25-30 minutes. No big deal right? Probably taking a shit. He finally walks out and there’s a piece of rope on the floor next to the toilet that he forgot there (I’m guessing to tie off). I didn’t say anything I just took the piece of rope and put it away in a hidden place. Next day he goes to the bathroom again for 25+minutes..and the bathroom mini trash can is moved from the corner wall to front and center in front of the toilet like someone was doing something over it. Finally he’s getting his bag to leave and I see Another small piece of rope in his bag that was sticking out. Am I tripping or is my friend shooting heroin in my house? I don’t notice any nodding off or sleepiness, If anything he’s very jittery after those bathroom visits (only for a short time).

Now I take 500mg a day to feel normal.

Ive been trying to fast taper down but I think Im moving too quickly; I was doing a 50% dose reduction every dose and consistently failing (but always trying again!). Ive been reading that medical fast tapers include 20-50% reduction every 1-2 weeks.

Which do you think is better for my situation? Jumping off completely or tapering down 33% of my dose every week until I can jump off completely? Ive been wanting to do cold turkey but havent successfully achieved that thus. I am also in progress of quitting nicotine at the same time (since ppl that quit opiates and nicotine are less likely to relapse as per redditors on here have said) and have successfully tapered myself from 50mg nic salts to 5mg nic salts over 1 month and have been staying at that level for now.

The biggest issue I have is that I run a kombucha nanobrewery and my kombucha brewery is established inside of a kratom and vape shop (the kratom shop owner was the one to help jumpstart my kombucha business and I got off of polydrug usage by using only kratom and eventually reached the point where I no longer had to spend any money on kratom to sustain my dependence).

He was in full blown heroin addiction for 12 more months. Complacency thinking he didn’t need a recovery support network and being around the wrong people.

He finally had enough and he has been 83 days off of it. However, due to the nature of his job he was around A LOT of coworkers who used pain pills. He hadn’t been taking subs when he returned to work after getting clean ( was all set and ready to start naltrexone ).. well you know how it goes.

So now he’s back to his original addition that started this all 12 years ago, oxy.. even when he was scrapping at penury to get his pills, he would rather be sick then go back to heroin. 

He’s been taking pills regularly for about 2 months now ( snorting). 

Took him away to detox this weekend and get back on track with suboxone management. 

I know what to expect with heroin withdrawal, I know how suboxone effects him with that withdrawal. But oxys are a different story. 

Does suboxone help with oxy as they do with heroin? Not as effective? More effective? Same 24 hour window?",3

Couldn't really tell you why other than I had easy access to oxy and felt like doing it. I have no impulse control. 

Tired of telling my partner I used again and hearing the disappointment and frustration. Tired of doing this cycle over and over. 

But also constantly feel an urge or need to use. Like I can't imagine myself not using for the rest of my life. Relapse feels inevitable, which I guess is why I don't feel that bad doing it. 

But I can't keep hurting the person I love like this. And I can't keep hurting myself like this. I feel like a piece of shit. I hate it. I hate that I ever started this back in December but truth be told it was inevitable. 

Sometimes I think about overdosing. But not in a way that I die. I've never OD'd and I guess I feel like if I did and survived then maybe that would be the kick in the ass I need to stay clean. I won't actually do it though. It's just a thought I have.

I'm just really upset with myself today. I'm lost and confused. In the past when I've relapsed my partner and I will talk for over an hour about it, sometimes arguing. Today it was just kind of silence. We've both said everything we can possibly say. But I'm still making the same mistakes. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I was driving home from work today, thinking about how I would tell them. I cried most of the drive. I hate who I've become and the shit I put myself and others through and yet I still wanna get fucking high. I don't know what to do",1

I have to face the fact that yes I do really have an addiction that could ruin my life. That is going to be the hardest part for me honestly.. accepting that I have a problem and openly talking about it.

I ll say now that this post may trigger anyone in recovery already so please be warned before reading.

Before I start asking questions I guess its best to give you all my background. Ive been addicted to Fentanyl for around a year now. Im 21 years old and live in the southwest of the USA. I live with my girlfriend and don't really have any family around me. My method of use has been consistent throughout my entire addiction. I use fentanyl intranasally by crushing fake percocet 30s i buy off the street. I use probably 6-8 of these pills a day, throughout the day.  I am in no way proud or happy with my addiction as im sure nobody is. I hate myself for it, and i want so badly to stop with every bone in my body. Ive tried to detox once before and it worked but soon relapsed a week or two after getting clean. I want to detox again but my use now has progressed far more than the last time. So i figured it would help to reach out to people that are going or have gone through the same thing to gain some much needed knowledge and tools to fight this once again, hopefully for the last time. My girlfriend and I are trying to prepare everything we can for me to fight this starting next week...

This is why im reaching out to you guys. I hope im posting in the right place and if not, please just let me know and i will take this down. My intention is not to encroach on anyone's safe space and id hate to be doing that.

All that being said I'm hoping to gather some information and tools, and hopefully form some positive connections with people that understand what im going through. I'm trying to write my survival guide and hopefully, one day, this will all be a part of someone else's. 

so my questions for all of you are, what can i do to lessen the physical symptoms of this detox? Ive gone through this once before and it was nothing less than sheer hell, i know thats what im facing. Is there anything i can do to just help myself through that? I have access to a small amount of gabapentin and xanax, Ive heard that those may help to an extent? I've bought a good amount of water and Gatorade to stay hydrated. Are there any vitamins i should buy that may help? I have a good amount of cannabis to help with the nausea hopefully as i have a medical card. I may be able to find a small amount of suboxone but should i even bother with another opioid? would that just prolong the inevitable? What are any detox survival tips yall could provide for me? Are there any fent tapering tactics i should be using in the upcoming time? Anything at all that would help to know?

I would appreciate any response more than i could type. Im scared out of my mind already knowing what im gonna be facing in the coming week. So any information yall can provide me would mean the world to me. Ive done a good amount of research already but would beat myself up if I didnt make this post. Like i said the specific opiate im going to be detoxing from is fent, so any specific information on that would be ideal but i will be thankful to yall for anything you could tell me.

Thank you more than I could say in advance,

2020-08-07 16:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/i5le9z/unbroken_brain_by_maia_szalavitz/,Unbroken brain by maia szalavitz,"I am currently reading this and I have to say it is a fantastic book. I am on chapter 17 so just a little bit over halfway through the book and a lot of the information in it is novel and refreshing. I picked it up because I have become super interested in the neurological aspects of addiction, and the general impact of the brain on learning and everyday life. From that standpoint, there is a lot of great information in the book and I really appreciate a lot of the context provided and the different perspective she shares. There is so much great information in the book about a wide variety of topics, of particular interest to me: addiction as a learning disorder, the recovery community in general and necessary reform, mental health, punishment as a deterrent, etc. I can really go on for a while....the content in general is amazing.

  
However, I am curious if anyone else that has read/ is reading this book finds the author insufferable? I know the book is funded by a Soros Justice Fellowship, and doing a bit of a dive into the book kind of leads one to question some of the statistics and studies that are presented as fact. She kind of blends some of her own politics (and his) politics in to the book as well which is fine because I expected that and that alone isn't suffocating its more just a slight annoyance. Her recommendation of Zoloft (i'm on it) is a bit dubious in that Soros has been commercially involved with Pfizer for a while. I don't really care that much about that part of it, but she is also very much playing the victim in numerous instances, and this also reads as somewhat of an autobiography that extends far too deeply into her experiences when the context doesn't really call for it. Not to mention her own mental illnesses and self admitted inability to perceive situations, people, or reality accurately. 

&#x200B;

It is kind of a duality in that I love a lot of the information in there, but I really dislike a lot of her anecdotes, personal opinions, and just general identity. I know it is a renowned book in the recovery community so I am just curious if I am the only one that feels this way while reading it. Maybe there are books that are similar in content that don't cram the author's opinions and experiences down your throat as much?",3

I’ve been off methadone and benzos after 13 years for 39 days and Kratom for 9 of those days. 

I can tell you firstly that if you want to quit any type of opiates, give Kratom a chance. 

Secondly, I must say that once the worst is over, the second wave of insomnia and lack of energy for me was honestly more menacing into letting me relapse vs the physical withdrawals. I never thought insomnia would make me want to relapse(along the RLS, feelings of 🐜 under your skin) but it did the most. I was begging for sleep and rest but I would punish myself into not taking benzos and definitely not opiates. 

However I wasn’t taking Kratom either and that made me inch closer towards the subs in my drawer or the benzos a phone call away. 

The insomnia funnily came in around day 35 and just lingered. I finally allowed myself to take Kratom at night and I don’t feel guilty. 

I could have taken the benzos or the subs. I didn’t. My wife has 10 percs in her drawer. I stayed away. I don’t want to get high. 

I just want to sleep. And function during the day. 

I never and don’t plan to take it during the day. It’s ok to fall back on Kratom to sleep. I think.

Last time I was clean this long was in jail and it didn't take. This time I choose to be clean, I checked into a 5 day detox with suboxone taper, they asked me if i wanted to go to their residential program, and I said yes. Turns out to be the best decision I have ever made. I know it is not always the same for everyone but The 90 days I spent in rehab were the most productive days I have ever spent fixing the problems of my life. My therapist was the most amazing person, and helped me progress more then I could ever have wanted. Since Feb 5th I've started making music full time, I've mended relationships, fixed wrongs, and became a generally overall better person, husband, and dad. If you are ever on the fence about going to a program, just go for it. Everyone there is in the same place as you mentally, the staff at my facility was mostly recovering addicts themselves from the technicians to the licensed therapists. What helped me the most to decide to stay was that I didn't have much to loose and everything to gain, and in the back of my head I always thought that even if I hate it, Drugs aren't going to disappear so whats 90 days. Well turns out 90 days was the start of a beautiful thing. Im proud of every single day, and I would not trade them for the world. So you the person on the fence unsure of the future, DO IT, take a chance, give it a shot, worst case you spent 90 days learning lessons for the time you are sure you want to stop.

That's what I would say out loud to others when they asked for an explanation but I was also saying it to myself for justification. 
I said it to my friends, my father and mother and siblings, and anybody else who realized I was going 100mph or slow as molasses and was curious. 

For a while, I believed myself. This was a ""finer"" state of mind to be in. Being stuck in my head with my thoughts was and is hell, anybody with OCD or another debilitating disorder can relate. I was looking for any way to quiet my awful and disgusting thoughts. I would be speeding all night with strangers and passing around a guitar, and I'd speed all throughout the day to get my work done. So that I could haul boxes faster and quicker, I could be nice to customers, my work was efficient. That's how it felt but that's not how it was. It was sloppy and I made a slew of mistakes day in and day out. Important mistakes in bookkeeping and counting, completely botching time clock entries and screwing up employees paychecks. Fast forward a couple years. Finally off and free from my new form of hell and debilitation, drug abuse. I find a new job in an office doing medical claims for a Medicare company. The pay and benefits are phenomenal, the work was interactive and challenging, it was enjoyable. Then it became mundane. Until I had a conversation about my bad habit in the break room. A coworker I'd never talked to turned to me and said ""you'd be surprised at how functional some people can be."" This lady, was my new dealer and I was her loyal customer. I started showing up late, filing things under the wrong programs, entering data assbackwards, promising doctors offices I would call back promptly but never did. It happened again. 
Fast forward to today. I haven't had a job in months because of this habit. I have decided it's time to do better. Withdrawal. It's day two. My stomach hurts so bad. I woke up and ran to the bathroom. There are beads of sweat hanging from my head. I tossed and turned and tossed and turned all night long. I hate being in my body. I made a call to my doctor, I let her office know I have a problem with substance abuse. The secretary told me she was sorry, she had never had someone call about this before and asked me to hold while she looked up protocol. I'm embarrassed.

My state border has been locked down for months so supply dried up and prices went up 350 a fucking q for anything decent. I couldn’t quit and blew 10k in 20 days overriding the implant. Couldn’t take it anymore. 
Drove myself 5 hours out of my city and took weed, mushrooms and a shit load of script drugs. 
Plan was either finally get over this fucking cunt or top myself. Second day I took the mushrooms. 
Took heaps as I was on benzos and they hell dull the effect. Took too much and scared the shit out of myself. Cried so much and dealt with so much. 
The mushrooms really helped with the withdrawals probably mainly cause I was so out of it to think about them but in the past lsd has helped withdrawals too. The mushrooms saved my life. 
The days after haven’t been easy but withdrawals are getting minimal. Restless legs still aren’t letting me sleep for long but the reset in my brain makes me feel so strong about being over this fucking drug. This sub is great and helps so much I just wanted to add mine in case it could help in any way.

How would you describe it? Is it a different smell depending on what opioid you're withdrawing from?

I find this really interesting and have always wondered about other people's experiences. 

To me (with fentanyl), it's a very dull, kinda sweet-ish smell. Hard to describe but I know, once I start noticing it, that the ""real"" withdrawal has begun. It comes way after the sweating and chills set in.

A little tangent:
It's funny a friend of mine (whom I've been trying to detox off fentanyl at home with) once said ""eww, go away, you smell like withdrawal!"" I think it's interesting why he thought it intensified once I got near him. (We were both in full blown wd.)  Could one in fact have a different body odor noticeable to others during detox? Maybe just like a person starving might at some point smell like acetone sometimes due to ketoacidosis?

I was just thinking about this and find it really interesting. How and why does this happen? I'm sure any of you who use drugs IV notice a very distinctive smell/taste with each drug they shoot. At least I do, and it's different with every single one (heroin, fentanyl and cocaine). 
I wonder why that is, just as much as I wonder how the hell yawning is connected to opioid-withdraw.

Also, if anyone has any scientific stuff about any of this, that'd be very interesting!",38

Tapered slowly over like 2 years on methadone, made the decision last Wednesday that i was done so i stopped taking my take homes (I was at 1mg). I was terrified, but overall, i feel weird but not sick; I just have this overwhelming feeling as if i should be constantly doing something, working on something.. its a odd feeling. Thought maybe this would be of interest to someone one.

Cheers

i was at 60mg when i finally started to take it seriously, i stayed at 60 for prob 4-5 months before i started to taper, and than from there i went down 2mg every 2 weeks, sometimes longer than 2 weeks, depending on how i felt.

I didn't start feeling rough till i got to about 20mg, at which point i went down 1mg every 2 weeks (sometimes longer)I would usually wait until i didn't feel sick in the morning before i went down again. Than i found at around the 5mg mark it really became a mind game, not knowing how i would feel once i finally got off terrified me and really made me think about just staying on because it was such a low dose but i just kept going, made it through the 5mg all the way to 1mg.

I woke up one day and decided, lets try this while i still have doses, and let me tell you, it has made a world of difference, knowing i could take a drink if i needed it...but it turns out, if you can keep busy with work, maybe smoke a little grass, you'll be alright. The withdrawl on a super slower taper seems to have been key, aside from feeling empty and anxious, and a little bit of restless limbs...im okay.

Hope that covers some of it, feel free to ask any more questions you might have.

PS. i was an iv heroin user for over 5 years, and a pill user for 5 years before that. I was on and off methadone the whole 10 years, only in the last 2 have i really taken it seriously with no dabbling or fuck ups. IT CAN BE DONE!",1

The truth is, I'm an addict, well my mom knows, everyone knows , I had a brief stint at a rehab facility when I was 25, I stayed clean according to the NA doctrine for about 18 months, after my 18 month celebration I thought I deserved a pill of tramadol as that is (or was) my DOC, anyway, I feel off the wagon, got clean again, I lost my girlfriend, I ruined our relationship, and that hurt her and unleashed her toxic personality, jump ahead to now, someone introduced me to Tianeptine as an alternative to tramadol, my first time trying it, I immediately touched the dragon, but it was only the first time, a few months passed, I buy tianeptine everyday, it's relatively cheap, it's legal and sold at all pharmacies and no one knows it gets you high, I still like tramadol but the dealers keep raising the prices, everytime you buy you're not sure if it's good shit or not and yes it's stronger but tianeptine gives me almost the same effect but different, so even if i have enough money for tramadol, I still get stablon (tianeptine).   
I lost alot of weight to the point that it's now really apparent and everyone is commenting, my overweight fuckbuddy kept making fun that her arm is thicker than my thigh, and I'm unable to work or produce any value to society, I mainly take money from my mom, do some tasks on the internet, I'm kinda known here on reddit as an amateur writer so I get a steady number of clients each months, but I'm unable to work, extremely unreliable and I trained my only friend to work with me, I do nothing he does all the work but we split the profit, well he works off templates I made, the clients come to my name and he even signs the emails with my name, so it's kinda fair, I guess. Anyway, I'm struggling to quit tianeptine, been trying to kick it off for months now, every day I tell myself another lie, until today, I ran out of lies, I had no strong withdrawal symptoms, I never get it hard, still, my brain kept asking me to get some, I didn't have enough money on me, so I took little money from my mom and got my first dose of the day, I don't know why I can't kick the habit, or stop the thoughts, with tramadol,I was always able to control it when I wanted to, but with stablon the fact that it exists at pharmacies, it's cheap...I dunno, all I know is that I'm lost, I want to have a better life, I wanna be a better person, I wanna achieve my potential and stop breaking my parents' hearts, but I'm powerless, I'm lost and I don't know what to do, and please don't tell me to go to a facility, first my parents can't afford it and second those guys here in my country are vultures and stupid as well, forgot to say that NA ppl tried to convert me back to islam when they knew I'm agnostic (for them I was just an infidel, yes I live in the middle east), I'm thinking of maybe making my best friend imprison me in his apartment for 3 days, I know that If I passed those 3 days I'll be able to control my habit, a lot is hanging in the balance and I'm not suicidal but something in my brains tells me, maybe we should check out the next body we'll have.

I’ve been struggling since I was 19, I’m 27 now. In and out of jail, rehabs, putting my family through so much hurt and just when I thought it couldn’t get worse anymore than it did... (felony CI sale from a fellow addict who was considered a “friend” , losing custody of my child bc of dirties, 6 months imprisonment, 4 years turned into 6 years probation) ... I didn’t think I could go back to this. 

I got on MAT, suboxone specifically back in 2016. Well that worked great for 5 YEARS, fiiivvee yearssss I had a false sense of normalcy. I thought I could stop this madness once and for all. I started having my teeth break from the suboxone.. so me being the impulsive addict I am, talked myself into quitting suboxone cold turkey, no weaning, at 12mg... and I rationalized utilizing short acting opiates, like oxy and fent, for two months to avoid the suboxone withdrawal. So after two months I then used suboxone for the first 3 days of detox, then used kratom for another 4 days, also gabapentin 800mg 4 x a day since I started my detox about 3 weeks ago now. This has been NO walk in the park and I also went back to work during my detox. I figured once I stopped the detox meds, other than gabapentin, I’d be able to tough it out with just the gabapentin right?? WRONG. I thought coming off the short acting opiates would be only a week- 2 weeks feeling crappy right? Well I got to 8 days nothing more than gabapentin and on that 8th day when I woke up it felt like day 1 and I’ve relapsed for the past 3 days :( 

I feel very powerless. I had to work last week and I have NO idea how I made it through work I was sweaty, mainly freezing, yawning, sneezing, watery eyes, upset stomach ... all of this dayssssss after my last day of kratom from an 8 DAY detox! Anytime I have ever done a detox I’ve never felt more tired, lightheaded, depressed after a detox, ever in my life. Would one think it is still from the suboxone withdrawal making it feel impossible to feel better 8 days AFTER last detox dose of kratom? I have been doing EVERYTHING I can to not go back to a facility. I cut off ALL ties with my suboxone doctor. It is NOT an option for me at this point to go back on it. I relapsed the past three days on H and some morphine. I have been reaching out to different Telehealth recovery programs near me. I wanted to try possibly trying something like Lofexidine... does anybody have any experience with this? Do you think it could potentially help? I have enough gabapentin left still and finally found the right kind of kratom that works for me. For the life of me I could not get the kratom to work it wasn’t touching the withdrawal, but there’s a specific kind for everybody I guess. I have a job and a family that NEEDS ME and the low energy, light- headedness is something I cannot deal with. I have to find a way to get through this somehow someway. It’s a scary place knowing you have so much weight on you like this. Where your work demands physical and mental clarity, which I don’t have either it seems as of recently. I’d give ANYTHING to get rid of these physical symptoms WITHOUT using any opiates to do. I wish I could do it without the gabapentin, but it doesn’t seem feasible at all at this time. I got some B-12 vitamins I’ve noticed they make my heart race like caffeine during withdrawal... also D3 vitamins seem to be very very helpful for at night especially. If you guys have any insight on how I could help my body for a good 2 weeks recover let me know... bc I think this detox is going to take a solid 2 weeks, but I don’t want to take one thing for that long. 

Sincerely,
Losing Hope",2

It felt fantastic. But now being on dope, I can't feel the kratom at all. I realise this is probably due to subs being only a partial agonist versus dope being full agonist. So my question is how long do I have to wait to actually feel the kratom and be able to notice it affecting me because so far, I've tried waiting 8 hours or so since my last dose of dope and will try taking kratom but I won't feel a thing. I've tried dosing pretty high too. Any advice is helpful.",1

I lost my mom 11 years ago. Prior you that I was being treated for back pain and that was when they were basically passing out scripts for pain meds like it was candy no questions asked!  So I was getting the basic 30 pills a month...I would break them in half and make them last a long time! I wasn't addicted at the time I don't believe! (Surely lying to myself but ya know) 

I lost my mom in 2009 to a rare form of thyroid cancer...I have ptsd from seeing her pass... It sucks. She was my best friend! That's when I realized I had a problem. I was trying to numb the pain and anxiety I had from losing my mom. I started running out of my medication rather than always having some left and I was taking the whole pill instead of half. I moved and started going to a different doctor and they upped me to 120 pills a month my first visit. Pain clinics weren't a thing yet! So you can see where this is going!

I eventually had to go to a pain clinic to start getting my meds because of the opiate crisis. I peed dirty because I smoked some weed. So that ended that! 
In 2015 I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy (with reconstruction) to remove the cancer. So I was getting loads of pain medication for that. I thankfully didn't have to go through chemo or radiation. But that didn't last! 

I have been buying from my person for over 5 years now. I only buy from them... No where else because I know they are their scripts and shits scary out there! I can't even begin to calculate the amount of money I've spent.....ridiculous! 
No one knows that I have this addiction(or maybe they do and just don't say anything)...I feel so alone! I just think if my mom was here I wouldn't be doing this. Not blaming my mom because it's my fault I couldn't handle losing here. She's was only 63.

I am a 50 year old mom to a beautiful daughter that is starting high school this year and I feel like the biggest piece of shit! She deserves the best! I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood. I pay my bills and have a job that I've been at for over 10 years!

I'm on day 3 of wd from an 80mg a day oxy habit. I'm only taking Kratom and I'm uncomfortable and my brain hates me! I know I need to pay the piper since this was my choice but ugh!!  If you have any suggestions on how to make wd more manageable please share! I'm scared.

I'm not sure why I posted this...I guess I just wanted to put it out there so I felt like I finally... After 11 years... Told someone! If you got this far... Thank you for reading!",47

Im literally choking up cause of how bored i am right now. I absolutely refuse to go drink to cure the boredom, which i will say the same for opiates.
Im literally just bored, walking for fun gets old fast, i do not enjoy reading, and im tired of sittin at home playing video games for hours. I really feel like im becoming depressed. And i dont know what to do. 

I guess im just being a small fry. I have 600 bucks left and i need it to spend on a room, as my lease is up in 14 days.

I'm  almost done with my  home suboxone taper, I started at 8mg around May  and i'm down to 1.5mg right now, dropping to 1mg in a few days and then I  will be stopping it completely soon when I decide a good place. Right  now i'm just pretty uncomfy,  restless, insomnia, abdominal discomfort,   just general discomfort and headaches. At the end of the day when  trying to sleep I yawn constantly, and have really runny eyes and i'm  not able to sleep for very long. This may be because my mouth literally  fills completely with spit when I have a dose in, probably greatly  inhibiting absorption. Has anyone tried putting their dose in between  your gums above your teeth or have any tips to absorb the dose better? I  saw a few places that can help if you're down to such a small dose and  your spit washes it from under your tongue.

If  anyone has any advice or tips as to what mg I should drop off or just  keep going lower and lower and powering through the taper?

Also,  if anyone has any remedies or things that can help with and alleviate  symptoms and help to get to sleep every night when I drop off  completely, that would be greatly appreciated.",2

I have one more shot cooked and ready for scheduled use at 6pm. I have a ton of suboxone to help with withdrawal but, ill have to wait at least 24 hours until i can take the subs. Ive done this plenty of times before and it never gets any easier and i was wondering if anyone had advice on just making it through the first 24 hours. For some context, ive been on a month long relapse after 8 months of sobriety, im using anywhere from a half gram to 1.5 grams a day, and ive been using it i.v for the last 2 weeks or so. idk if that information helps at all but im thinking maybe if you know how much, and the way ive been using will give you an idea on how bad the withdrawals will be. Its all been black tar and no fentanyl to the best of my knowledge, however thats not always easy to tell. Thanks in advance to anyone who can give me advice, if i dont stop now my parents will find out eventually and ill be homeless again :/",2

That’s one of the biggest things that made me want to quit. 

I think this applies to all opiates. With MDMA, marijuana, LSD, even amphetamines to an extent, you may have moved on from those days but when I look back at the experiences I’ve had with those it’s nostalgia. Good memories. There are more drugs than just what listed but you get the point. 

When looking back at opiate use, and tianeptine use. Nothing productive came out of it. Nothing good. Just dark times. Chemically induced, short lived happiness. It makes you feel good and like everything is fine, until it wears off.

Wanted to add, a lot of the point of this thread is to help people realize that they don’t miss the high. They miss the life that comes with being a addict. 

How do you guys feel about it? If you disagree, please explain why, I’m interested to hear from you guys. 

**Much love to everyone going through some dark times right now, everything will be over and work out. I mean this sincerely, not just empty words**

They’ve had clean periods throughout those years but ultimately keep going back. The longest sobriety period was this last one, being around 15 months. However, 12 of those were spent incarcerated. 
 
Once released, they continued on the methadone program since it was offered in prison. They earned the trust of the doctor which ultimately led to 6 bottles being brought home a week and only being urine tested once a month. 

Well, they are back using every day. They’ve tried detoxing at home 3 times and once feeling better for a day or two, they go back to using again! 

I’m torn here and very fortunate to of never had an addiction however this makes its extremely hard to understand and relate to them. 

Please tell me what I should do, what I should offer as support or what it is you wish you had from a family member/close friend during these times in your life.",5
