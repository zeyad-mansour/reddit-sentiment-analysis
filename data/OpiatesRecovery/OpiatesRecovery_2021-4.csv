2021-04-29 19:53:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/n1holq/all_alone_on_fantasy_island/,All Alone on Fantasy Island...,"Bare with me folks, this might be a long one but I just want to rant... or I just need to document this for my future self...

The disease of addiction was working on me today y'all... I have this thing where I see cars coming down the road, and if they don't belong around here, I make note of it. For whatever reason, I also suspect some of these cars are drug dealers dropping off or buyers copping. Weird right? There is something wired very strange in my brain. ¬†But the thing is, when I see a car just randomly pull over on the side of the road and wait, my mind goes back to my using days and I'm sitting there in the middle of a very dangerous neighborhood in the¬†middle of a hella dangerous city. And I'm of course waiting on my drug dealer. Most of the time I have no idea where I am. And I have to rely on GPS to get me outta the places. I'm at the mercy of that fucking drug.   


Today, I would seriously never venture into such places. But I can tell you I've put myself in so much danger over the years. Just trying to get high, and then the actual using of the drug too. But these times when I've had a gun in my face, or see it sitting in the seat next to a person, yet I don't care I just get in the car anyway. Or I give out my phone number. I mean that is not me. That is not who I used to be. I was cautious and honestly, way too much of a chicken shit to ever have done this shit before. Nothing takes over your¬†thinking like addiction.

Now when I see a car exhibiting the same behavior I once did, all I can think about is drugs. And just a few minutes ago I literally fantasized a scenario where I could get high. And for what reason? I do not know. I just stared into space and dreamed up this fantasy world where I bought the drug, used the drug, got high, felt great, and nobody knew... what the actual fuck?

So I watched a vehicle pull up across the street from me, and park on the curb behind a my neighbor's vehicle. The windows were tinted and I could see that the guy was on the phone. A girl was with him and watching him intently. I can't help it but it reminded me of the many many times I was out in the city waiting, and I would see couples sitting together in the front seat, waiting just like me for the dealer to show up, and one would be on the phone usually while the other watched intently demanding an answer to the ever obsessive question all addicts want to know... when will my next fix get here.¬†

So, of course this addict's¬†brain takes me to those days. Even the times when I had a using friend with me, and one of us would be on the phone with the dealer, and the other would be watching carefully for the answer to that question. So I thought to myself, very sadly, what if they're waiting¬†on their dealer. What if I was walking around over there, and came up on them, and seen them counting a butt load of 20s or laying out some powder in a line and they looked up and seen that I caught them. What if, they then offered to give me some or sell me some to keep me quiet? Probably would never happen, most of us would rather die than give up our drugs, but what if? Ok, so I went even further with this fantasy because that's how sick I am...

I imagined myself walking back to my house and grabbing a 20 ever so discreetly, walked back over to their vehicle, and¬†was handed 5 pills. I seen myself and could almost feel myself put them in my bra. I watched myself walk back up on my porch, sit down and then I felt myself contemplate if I would take one. And I told myself, I wouldn't want to but I would want to. I even looked down at¬†my daughter's bottle of water and told myself, I would take one now, chew it up real quick and use that bottle of water to wash it down. Just the one. The rest I'd save for my upcoming dental surgery of course. And it would be fine. Just this one time, right?  


I even heard myself realizing that this would mean the end of my clean time. My clean date would change, I'd lose my clean time. I'd feel horrible about myself. I'd get on my meeting in the morning and definitely share on that burning desire. I'd have to tell them that I took the pill. And I knew I was relapsing when I did, but I didn't care. I knew that would mean the end of my service commitments. I could no longer be a trusted servant. Yet I still took that damn pill. I even went through how I would have to tell everyone in the morning that I was sorry. I knew I disappointed them. I heard myself thinking about how some people would defniately be shocked. Some people look up to me, and might think if I relapsed, then how the hell would it not happen to them?¬†

I ultimately got up out my seat in that moement and grabbed my laptop. The people in that vehicle that¬†didn't belong in my neighborhood actually were looking at the house across the street that is either for sale or rent. So, I realized I was thinking crazy and not only would I most likely never just randomly walk up to a car and score, but I also would most likely run away at the actual situation in front me. I have before. I was faced with drugs right in front of my face, and I walked away,¬†very quickly,¬†and didn't look back. I spoke about that incident in my meeting the day after it happened. As I told the story I realized that for the first time ever, and I MEAN EVER, I was offered drugs and didn't take them. I was given the chance to get high and walked away from it. I was given the chance to have some relief from the hell my mind sometimes is trapped, but I ran away. I said no to drugs. I said no to my ADDICTION. And while I was sharing this experience, I realized I'm a hell of a lot stronger than I give myself credit for.

So just now, I'm realizing that just because I made up this little crazy insane fantasy doesn't mean I'm crazy. It was my disease talking to me. That is for certain. And I used my coping skills to shut it the fuck down. There was no actual threat to my sobriety, that was in my head. But that disease could have manifested in another form today, and yet, here I am once again telling it to go fuck off. I'm doing pretty good in that department. But I still don't truly feel like I've been really tested. I haven't had some crazy traumatic incident happen yet, or some crisis that I just couldn't handle. Maybe I won't, but I feel like I must keep prepping for disaster. Not insanely. Not obsessively. But in a healthy way, I have to continue the fight. I have to stand up to the disease of addiction because I can not afford to lose my recovery. My recovery is¬†the only thing that keeps me clean and alive. Seriously, if I lost that, I'd die. And I truly don't want to die. I love my husband too much to hurt him like that. I love my kids way too much to leave them without a mother. I love my family too much to devastate and traumatize them in that way. And I love MYSELF enough to know that¬†I deserve better and that I deserve the¬†life that I've always wanted.¬†

Vivitrol isn‚Äôt helping as much anymore. When will this end?","I‚Äôve been getting the monthly vivitrol shot off and on during my recovery since late 2019. It SAVED me during the first 6 months or so of my recovery. Then I didn‚Äôt keep up on it as much. In October 2020 the circumstances aligned and I relapsed on heroin, straight back to IV of course. I went back on vivitrol after that weekend bender and have been good. I learned my mistake. 

Well, this past month, my vivitrol did NOT help. About 2 weeks after my shot at the end of March, I was having such bad cravings, using dreams again, etc. I fought the cravings for a bit but then I tried using kratom (I keep it around but hardly use any) one night because I was craving heroin so bad. 

I realized that my receptors must not be blocked because I could actually feel the kratom and was high. I decided I would try and find heroin to use once or twice since my vivitrol wasn‚Äôt appearing to work anymore. Sure enough the heroin worked, only 2-3 weeks after my last vivitrol shot. I used to feel safe because I knew that I couldn‚Äôt get high even if I wanted to. Now, I know that‚Äôs not true. Even vivitrol won‚Äôt protect me anymore. 

I used a lot this last week, knowing I was due for my next shot, today at 9am. My appointment was cancelled because my dose never got delivered to the clinic. I think this is actually good because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get PWDS. that would suck. 

So today I‚Äôm just gonna take care of myself through these mild withdrawals I‚Äôve gotten myself into. It‚Äôs a shame that tolerance builds so fast, even years after you were physically addicted. I don‚Äôt want to make this worse on myself, I‚Äôm gonna have to stop eventually, and I don‚Äôt want to make things worse and get PWDs if I got the vivitrol shot after using for over a week straight. 

All I know is I don‚Äôt want this for myself. But without the vivitrol working, I feel like there‚Äôs not much stopping me except my own weak willpower anymore. 

I lived out of state for over a year of my recovery and just moved back to my hometown which is making things harder too. More support, but more temptation. Maybe I need to start going to meetings again or something, but I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the program and step work and all that. Maybe that will be my downfall, if I‚Äôm not willing to get extra support from AA... but I did good without it for so long, that I feel I can do it again.

I Went about 2 days in there eating talking sleeping and feeling generally happy. Then the withdrawals came, it was terrible. I only lasted about 24 hours after withdrawals came and then I packed my things and left. It was the Fist time really experiencing withdrawals on that level probably because of the methadone usually keeping me stable if I ran out of fent. So i relapsed and all the money i spent on detox down the drain.

I came up with a plan, i wasn't going to use benzos or methadone and limit my fentanyl use to 1-2 bags a day. Ive been doing this for over a week and on the 1st i start detox again but without methadone and xanax in my system. Im hoping that this will reduce my withdrawls a little bit, but also i feel more equipped. 

It was weird that I didn't start withdrawling for 48 hours, im guessing that on straight fentanyl that i will feel shitty a lot sooner.

How long after last dose do withdrawals typically start? And how many days after will it last. They give me subs on the 72nd hour so..

I went on a little binge last time before the first detox to build my courage so i could go in high.

I really don't want to go back as the clinic in my town as kept me on it for over SEVEN YEARS for a minor pill addiction. I had my dose raised all the way to 140mg at one point, because I would get kicky and not feel good at night. I kept asking for a peak and trough, but I had a shit counselor who said I had to be on 100mg to get it. I then later found out after I was already over 120 that I didnt have to, and tapered 1mg/3days to get to 74. I ended up getting pregnant because my ex purposely broke a condom when my lowest estrogen birth control needed a MONTH not 2 weeks like normal b/c (I have severe migraines and ocular/aura migraines) the doctor tested me multiple times at the clinic (fucking whack job) and said I was negative (I was over 3months and yes, I saw the fucking ultrasound.) I ended up telling the director in fear of other girls getting hurt, she got in trouble, would continously up my dose 10mg at a time saying I ""looked like I was withdrawling, took my bottles away even though I was high risk and made me come to every other day to dose to ""monitor the baby"" (BS, she saw me ONCE during my pregnancy for questions and dopler.) The only time they are supposed to up your dose is if you are feeling sick, or you test negative for methadone in your system. Welp I ended up going all the way to 140 because of that cunt. After that I was passed around multiple times and even sexually harassed by the clinic, I finally got to taper after losing my bottles while having the flu I missed one bottle and they took my bottles, took 1 year to get them back, at that point when I did my final drug test (this was maaaaaybe 4 to 5 months before March 2020) I tested CLEAN for methadone. Of course the ONE TIME I couldn't be watched for my test as there was no females to watch, and I already had issues in the past with being accused of having fake pee because my creatinine levels were too low, but methadone was present (wtaf right?) and had to do saliva tests and blood tests to prove it. I ended up begging and pleading to let me retest and filed a complaint it was their fault for making me test and not having a female watcher present. They let me, but I was sure it was because I was detoxing to quickly that I had tested clean and jumped back up to 50mg just to make sure as my counselor said it might be I was detoxing to quick and it made me clean (later found out from my current counselor I infact didn't have methadone BUT HAD METHADONE METABILITE. Fucking retarded newb director. This was right at covid and I lost the best cousloer I ever had. Never missed a beat to taper me how I wanted and when I wanted. Also during that time our clinic got cyber hacked and ransomed so it was a fucked time. Wait times at opening were sometimes 2 hours before we could dose. It was hell. Anyways, got 3 new counselors since then and tried to taper continuously. And it never happened. I had got bounced around many times after my amazing counselor got promoted, all shit workers that now dont work there, also getting in trouble when THEY missed my telecoinseling even though I called and tried, or they would my my apps and it was the end of the month and no one was available. This was one of the MAAAAANY motivators to leave. Plus I'm sick of this shit. 

My point to this post is to ask, whats better, suboxone, or methadone. Which one doesn't fuck your teeth up as much, weight gain etc etc. Please share your experiences. I started my CT detox on the 17th, but because of my place selling, being unemployed as I used the pandemic to detox cold turkey but due to many people failing me, I finally got the chance to don't was was served a 2 month notice 3 days after I started. That as the possibly running out of time to move, I did dose the follow Wednesday (50mg) to make sure I'd keep my 13 bottles. That would take over 2 years to get back if I missed. My biggest problem with the clinic is I have been trying to taper since FEBRUARY of LAST YEAR and not one went through do to counselor change, someone made a error, or ""oops I forgot"". I have a chance through my local low income medical doctor office to do only over the phone counseling with subs, but idk if thats any harder to kick. 

The whole time I've been on methadone, I've been clean and have no desire to use. I still don't, thats why I knew I'd be a good candidate for cold turkey. I just wanna know your guys experiences with methadone and suboxone detox, side effects and which you think is better. Sorry for the long story, just wanted to explain why I'm so over methadone. Because these simple fucks I missed seeing my grandpa before he died, ans his funeral due to them lagging on getting me extra bottles to travel. I dont wanna be tied down to that shit clinic any more. Not to mention the opening dose when you start is 45mg! Not like 15 to 29 to stabilize. You take 30/35mg and then an hour later 10/15mg. 

Im so tired of this part of my life...I wanna quit. Being a single mom of 3 beautiful kids, you dont get a lot of chances to be sick in bed for weeks, but I'm hoping I can continue but at this point, I wanna stabilize on whatever is better, or would it be better to buy norco/dailudid and just kick that if I can move in with friends family. I'm so fucking over this shit. I should have been gone years ago but instead I was thrown around and treated like trash. 

Please help....I dont want this to be my life. I read up that after being on methadone for 10 years they usually won't even let you get off it because its intense and hard for the body to get off of at that point. 

Please sure your stories. Times lines. Experiences. PAWS and how long did the insomnia/stage three of withdrawl last? Anything. Im feeling so depressed that I made it almost two weeks and have to quit...im just. Utterly...destroyed.",2,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8893675}"

Please drop some info, tips, motivation, stories, and how long it took for you to start feeling normal/ when you stopped taking subs (if you did use them)","Since the start of COVID is when I really got into doing more downers since lockdown happen and nothing else to do. From the beginning of 2020 I got more into oxy m30 but not as consistently. About 3-4 maybe 5 times a month if I had the extra cash to get it. And I was new into the script world so I didn‚Äôt have any WD whatsoever from the Oxys. Until spring time is when I told myself NO MORE. But that did not work out as I just moved onto H since it‚Äôs cheaper to get a G of H than my usual 5-10 Oxy habit. 

I turned my habit into an addiction. And that shit came at me like a damn wrecking ball. (que the miley cyrus song haha) 


Being on H and Tweak consistently for about almost a year,  like 6-7 months now since the spring of last year. And now it‚Äôs time for me to bid a good riddance to this shit. I dont even get high anymore, I just got into the habit of doing it and I‚Äôm so selfish and a big baby that first, I don‚Äôt want to kick I hate kicking off H and second  I don‚Äôt want to go thru the WD and just sobering up in general because I know it‚Äôs going to be a bitch. I‚Äôve done my fair share of other drugs like cocaine, X, psychedelics but never got addicted and the come down was bearable.  But H, is the worst and I‚Äôve relapsed a good 10 times before now it‚Äôs now or never. I‚Äôm tired of this shit, I hate having to think about H and going thru my day smoking. After doing one thing, go smoke. Bored? Go smoke. About to go to bed what should I do? Go smoke. I hate having to spend money on this when this money can go to other shit that isn‚Äôt this drug. All my motivation and push gone, can‚Äôt go on with my day or even go about my day without hitting the pookie pipe. There‚Äôs so much more but I think y‚Äôall get me. And this sucks because I got my bf into this stuff also so we‚Äôre both addicts. I feel like shit getting him into this. I always tell him that but he reassures me that it was his choice but still If it wasn‚Äôt for me he wouldn‚Äôt be on this. Me and him would smoke .5 each to maybe about 1 g each depending on the day / if it‚Äôs the weekend and if our dealer didn‚Äôt skimp us of our sack so the next day we gotta get a little more. Went from 3 times a week to every day me and him smoke H and Tweak. 


Thank you for reading my rant/ confession, truly means a lot that strangers on reddit is supportive and helping more than people or friends I know IRL. No one knows about me and my bf situation except like 2 people and they‚Äôre on it also but don‚Äôt plan on quitting but they understand if me and him have to go MIA on them for a while to get sober. I‚Äôm truly honestly frightened for what comes next since this was a big part of our lives for a good 6-7 months. How are we gonna fill the gaps in between when we hang out since it was filled with picking up and smoking. Are we even gonna feel the same with each other after? I‚Äôm scared if we relapse if we can‚Äôt take the WD. I know I am overthinking this but I can‚Äôt help it but I need to stop. The more I think about it it‚Äôs going to psych me out of quitting and moving forward with it. I know me and my bf can get thru this and we loved each other even before the drugs got into the picture and we‚Äôre gonna love each other during and after, hell, probably way more we‚Äôre gonna be in love with each other after going thru this journey, but we‚Äôre so ready to quit. It‚Äôs kinda just me in my head about it but I will stop. 

So yeah here is my little back story, Again thanks for reading if your got this far and thank you for the support and love. 

A little more info: we have subutex and suboxone for the WD. We‚Äôre gonna taper off them, go to the gym to sweat it off, try and eat normally, Taking 5- HTP and maybe L- Tyrosine for our brains, multivitamins, lots of water of course, and love and support from one another <3 if anyone has any pointers, tips, do or donts, comments, concerns, advice please leave them down below they will be greatly appreciated.

A new dealer pointed a gun in my face over a miscommunication last Tuesday, so I had a bit of a come-to-God moment and decided to come home from Detroit to my parents‚Äô place near Toledo.

The first three days of withdrawal were agony. But then I inducted on to Suboxone using .5mg microdoses and am stable at day five on 1mg/day. Less really is more with this medicine.

On evening five, I went out on a walk with my parents, whom I haven‚Äôt seen in any meaningful way for almost a year. 

Most of the physical withdrawal had subsided and I was sleeping at night again by this point, but I still felt a little lethargic and depressed from having thrown away nearly a year of sobriety on a 15-month run.

But quite suddenly, while walking, everything clicked again. 

I feel the wind on my face.

I smell the charcoal burning in my neighbor‚Äôs grill. 

I see the vivid, marvelous spring colors in the yards, green grass and weeds, brilliant wildflowers.

I hear the distant lawnmowers and sprinklers.

I taste the crisp air.

You don't even have to get out of bed to do it! Just get really comfortable in bed, relax yourself and just follow along to what he says. when I first started doing this (3-4 days ago, I was barely able to hit the 1 minute mark, and now im JUST under 3 minutes of holding my breath everytime and it's helped me with my stamina when I take my dog for a run! yesterday I was able to jog DOUBLE the distance before I felt like I was running out of fuel) 

I do this 3x a day, and I start everyday off with this breathing technique and honestly it almost gives you a euphoric feeling, helps keep your mind off your thoughts and it just genuinely feels amazing. If that helps you, you could also try taking a cold shower every morning! start off with warm water, clean yourself off and when you're done, slowly but surely ease into cold water and just stand under the water for 10-x seconds/ minutes however long you can take it for! I started this 3-4 days ago, and im seeing HUGE progress in all aspects of my life. I don't take hot showers anymore because it honestly reminds me SO much of that feeling of when you get high off opiates.

It's not going to be easy at first, but you can ease into it and everyday it will become easier and easier and you'll see your breathing and everything else get better with time.

I guess I've been going on and off of oxy for over a decade. But a few months ago, I was introduced to pressed pills that are supposedly oxy 10 mg. I cannot tell how strong they are but it's definitely stronger than a 10 oxy. This person readily had these available far too often. So I've been taking these for the past 3 months to avoid withdrawals. I've got it down to 1 pressed pill per day plus 20 MG of oxy. Tomorrow I'm running out of everything. I have a lot of kratom though. I'm afraid of how bad the withdrawals will be. I've lost all motivation in my life, I can't even remember what my dreams are. What's worse is I've gotten so despondent lately, that I don't care. I can easily see myself going back and getting more of these pressed pills. I want my libido back. I want to feel something, anything. But I don't want withdrawal. And I don't want to put in the time it takes. I've gone through it so many times.

Its gotten to the point where im not even getting that high, just maintaining and feeling slightly above baseline. At this point I dont even know where my baseline is because im high 95% of the time im awake.

I was on suboxone for about 3 months from november through January, but I hate it because it makes me feel more ‚Äúzombified‚Äù than other harder opiates. Im currently taking a low dose of kratom each day, however I‚Äôm still a bit sick. I plan to stop taking kratom at the two week mark and then go from there.

It feels like in the last 3 years ive lost all my interest in most things, and the things that brought me joy and excitement no longer bring me anything. I barely listen to music any more even though I listened to it all day in the past.

Helen Redmond went to six countries to create ""Liquid Handcuffs: A Documentary to Free Methadone"". She created this film to address the struggles many people face when trying to get the medication they need; Methadone. Methadone is, to put it simply, a medication used to treat patients battling addiction by reducing the pleasure experienced from taking opioids, heroin, or other addictive drugs. This severely reduces the urge to take whatever the addictive drug is. With less of an urge to take addictive drugs, it's no wonder why the number of people overdosing and addiction rates fall by nearly half in locations it's accessible. Yet, there are so many obstacles for patients to jump through in order to get their treatment. In this episode, we discussed everything related to Methadone, from what it is, to its impact, to how we can improve its accessibility.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5305998}"

2021-04-26 03:25:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mys2y1/it_works/,It Works,"My name is Robert, and I am an alcoholic. Furthermore, I am a person who is recovered from countless addictions and behavioral challenges. I was like so many individuals who were lost and afraid that nothing would ever change. I remember feeling so isolated and alone as a child. I was so confused and scared that I would get lost in my tears. I remember lying in bed at night when I was five and six years old and wondering why it hurts so much being me.

As I grew older, the pain deepened. When your pain goes to the degree that my pain did, it sets up an interesting dynamic. We learn at an early age that we are just not comfortable in our skin. From the earliest of memories, I remember I wanted to be somebody else, doing something else, be somewhere else. I did not feel comfortable in my skin. I was never satisfied.

My family dynamic was that of an alcoholic father, a codependent mom, and I was the middle child of seven children. We grew up in a home that was always upside down, and trying to find my balance was impossible. I became the chameleon. I never knew what someone else wanted or how I could become what I had to become for others to accept me.

Maybe you can relate to these feelings that I had. By the time I was a teenager things became much worse. As a child, little is expected of you. As we grow, so do the expectations that others have for us. This was not only true in my family, my social circles, and even academically. Because I did not feel that I had value I did not believe I could produce anything of value. The hole gets deeper and deeper and deeper.

We end up in what I have heard termed ‚Äúthe hole of no hope.‚Äù When I was 14 years old, I took my first drink because I could get away with it. I remember how it made me feel once the alcohol hit my system. I went from being nothing to almost. When you come from nothing, are convinced you are always going to be nothing, being an almost is the top of the world. Every subsequent drink I took was an attempt to recapture that feeling of being an almost.

When one is convinced they will never amount to anything, being an almost is everything. In the beginning, it seems harmless enough and the frequency was based on the amount of emotional pain that I was feeling. I found as I got older, and my social circle grew, and my family and educational expectations grew, my anxiety of not measuring up grew as well. As I was constantly being reminded, the feeling that I was nothing grew, and so my need to be an almost grew proportionately.

Since I could not become almost on my own, I had to find the opportunity and the alcohol to be fulfilled. This is where the cycle became dangerous. My reliance was not on me feeling good about who I was. It was based on a substance that I found myself increasingly needing in frequency and amount.

When I turned 16 years old, I realized my drinking was getting out of control and had become obvious to others. It became necessary for me to experiment with other substances that would enhance my sensation that alcohol alone could no longer produce. In the beginning, a joint here and a joint there was sufficient, but that would make me tired and lethargic, and I was not left with a very adequate means to concentrate in school.

Someone introduced me to methamphetamines, and this helped keep me up and active during the day. Now instead of just drinking, I was smoking marijuana and eating amphetamines. The challenge with that was not eating, and I found it increasingly more difficult to sleep. That is when I began to introduce barbiturates into the rotation. Barbiturates were a very curious drug; that they did what alcohol was doing, but did it without the hangover. This went on and on until I got to my senior year in high school and on my 18th birthday, I decided to drop out of school.

It was January 3rd, and I would graduate that May. Nevertheless, my drinking and using career was needing my attention. I found it more important and more necessary to drink and use than what I thought a high school education could bring me. As the years passed and my struggles became greater, there was not a relationship or an opportunity that I was not willing to set aside to drink and use.

By the time I was 27 years old, I had become chronic in my addiction. I had added compulsive gambling, overeating, pornography, and I started throwing up three to five times per day. I was at the end of my rope and I knew that if something did not change, I was going to die. I knew there were no more chances for me.

On February 9th of 1986, I entered treatment and admitted I was an alcoholic. I was introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other 12 step groups. I began my pursuit of recovery. I began going to meetings and meeting new people. I was enjoying what I was finding in the rooms of recovery. Nevertheless, I found it so difficult in being honest with others.

I was sincerely afraid that you would find out that I was nothing. I knew that if I spoke too much or became too honest, you would figure that out and I would be the first person in the history of a 12-step program that you would ask not to come back. I know that sounds laughable to some, but it was a real fear for me.

Once again, I knew that something had to change, or I was going to die. I knew honesty was the best path for me, yet being honest was almost as fearful as the death that was waiting for me. Sadly, that led to my relapse after 71 days of being sober.

Fortunately for me, I only found it necessary to drink for five days. I was trying to recapture that feeling of being an almost. At the end of those five days, I realized that the only place for me was back in the rooms of recovery. On April 25th of 1986, I walked back into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have never left.

That means that as of April 25th of 2021, I am celebrating 35 years of personal recovery. Even more astounding than 35 years is that it translates into 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to my addiction. The journey has been remarkable.

There have been some challenges along the way, but then again, life is filled with challenges. I will never forget what it was like being a newcomer. It was the most frightening thing that I had ever experienced and yet I could not leave because I knew that I would die.

I realized that the only way for me to stay clean and sober and to become happy, joyous, and free was to apply the plan of recovery to the best of my ability. I made it my passion to go to meetings, get and work with my sponsor and become acclimated to a power greater than myself. As I did those things and began incorporating the 12 steps into my personal life things began to change in ways that I could have only dreamed of.

I went from being a nothing and an occasional almost to somebody who had more hope than anyone I had ever met. I began to resemble the people that I had met in the rooms of recovery. I began living and sharing some of the stories that I had heard them share with me.

When I would hear them share those stories my heart began to dance and sing, and I wished that those things would happen to me. They have happened to me and so many more. I cannot imagine a life that does not include one day at a time (ODAAT) and living a plan of recovery. I can honestly tell you for nearly all my 35 years of personal recovery, I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and peace in anticipation because of what I have been so freely given.

I meet many people who are struggling the way I had struggled. I speak with many individuals who are trying to find the magic that would take them from dying a lonely death to a life of personal fulfillment and that surpasses all understanding. This is what I have found in my recovery journey. I was so fortunate that I met so many amazing people along the way.

Every person of significance to me, (outside of one who died during a relapse) is either clean and sober today or has passed away in sobriety. When I mentioned these individuals, I am talking about people who are sober 37, 39, 41, and 44 years. My sponsor Jack passed away two years ago with 44 years of personal recovery. Individuals like Texas Mike, Pete the Greek, Russian Ted, and Doc Irv all passed away as recovered members of the 12 Step Program.

One of the most exciting things about the plan of recovery that I followed is that it is a complete blueprint. When followed, the likelihood of having all the things it promises is all but guaranteed. I don't mean to say that everyone who starts the program of Alcoholics Anonymous finishes or lives a sober life.

What I am saying is I have never known anyone to relapse when they followed the path. After my relapse back in 1986, I was face to face with how dangerous I was to myself. The prospect of another relapse scared me more than I had ever been scared. I asked my sponsor what I needed to do to never relapse again. The answer was simple. The answer is service.

When I decided to incorporate the plan of recovery into my life for the express purpose of becoming more equipped to help others it completely revolutionized my thinking. I was no longer about me. It was about ‚Äúwe.‚Äù Developing this way of thinking was transformational for me.

A section in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous talks about selfishness and self-centeredness being foundational to every problem I had ever had. Setting aside my ego is the best thing I could ever do.

Growing in sobriety has been the greatest journey one will ever take. That is exactly what recovery is. Recovery is a journey; it is not a destination. I am so glad that there is a finish line other than death.

My goal is to accomplish what my sponsor Jack Fisher accomplished. Jack sadly succumbed to cancer a little more than two years ago. At the time of his death, Jack had 44 years of continuous sobriety. As I chatted with him in his hospital room and knowing it would be the last time I was to see him alive, I asked him ‚ÄúJack, what do I tell them? What is your message you want me to share with others?‚Äù Jack looked at me with his cancer sunken eyes and said ‚ÄúBob, tell them it works.‚Äù

That simple phrase has resonated with me in different ways. The most important way it resonated with me is that it underscored the simplicity of what we're doing. There is no magic. There is no wondering if or how or when. The program of recovery works when you work it.

My message to you - and I want you to hear this loud and clear - is it works. I see so often people in social media bashing one recovery program or another.

Here's the deal, they all work. When you look at some of the programs within the monotheistic religions of the world and other secular programs, they work. There are far too many people who have been successful to suggest that they don't work. The common denominator of anything less than success is not the program, it is the person applying the program.

The opening paragraph in Chapter 5 of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous reads ‚Äúrarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program.‚Äù End of the story. I am fully convinced that when we apply the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and the plan as laid out in the first 164 pages of recovery, our result will be permanent sobriety.

I also believe this to be true with the Muslim Faith, Judaism, LDS Recovery, Celebrate Recovery, the Buddhist Network, and the list goes on and on. If you are involved in any of these programs or find a program where it has been demonstrated that it has worked for countless others, then guess what, if it doesn't work it is you. Why not humble ourselves?

Why not be as honest as only a dying person can be honest? I love the simplicity of the program as it states all we need to be is honest, open-minded, and willing. If we are these three things daily, there is never any reason for us to go back out again. So many people go out and never come back.

I count myself so fortunate to be a person who relapsed, found the doors of recovery still open, and gave it another go. As I wrap up this message to you today, I want you to know how grateful I am to have been given the gift of recovery. When I consider myself to have been clean and sober for 3 1/2 decades I am beyond grateful. What is even more astounding is that today is day 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to death.

The areas in my life that I have been given are beyond, but I believe I deserve it. I have a marriage of 32 years. My children that I abandoned at the height of my addiction have forgiven me and we have a loving and working relationship that is in a continual process of heightened healing.

I don't regret who I am. Matter of fact, I celebrate who I am. I am no longer a person who came from nothing and would remain a nothing. My goal is no longer to be almost. Today I am somebody filled with hope, potential, and a satisfying heart of helping others achieve what I have been able to achieve.

I hope you are one that I can pass this mantle onto as you are beginning or continuing your journey of recovery. I have been blessed, fortunate, and honored to go from broken to whole. I desire to teach and guide others to find their way.

There will come a time that I am as Jack was. I will be laying in a hospital bed getting close to my last breath and someone that I love and who loves me will ask me what my message is that they can pass on. My message to them will simply be ‚Äúit works.‚Äù

History: Addicted to heavy painkillers for years everything from percs to IV fentanyl. 

How i got clean: Suboxone taper to 1mg a day, 7 day morphine 50mg a day short acting dosing after last suboxone. Ibogaine Total alkaloid TA 1.5g at home 12 hours after last dose of morphine. 1 week after ibogaine dosing one more booster of 500mg of ibogaine TA.

Staying clean: How to deal with the lack of drugs/depression in your life. The key is lsd or magic mushroom microdosing. This curbed all cravings and made me the happiest person alive without opiates. Doses are 10mcg of lsd or 0.2g of magic mushroom a  week.

How long have I been clean: 4 years now and going strong never once had a craving or want to do opiates and I was at parties that had it going around.

I got my best gf and we spent alot of time together but she found a new boyfriend who lives a few hours away and now they are 2 weekends in a row at his house and the other 2 at her house. When they are here we spent time together either on the weekends or under the week. I am now the third week at home again since detox, in my country you have to go to the detox facility to get on subs or polamidon and you are 3 weeks at the facility. Anyways I met there 3 people who I really liked and I thought we could be good friends, it turned out to be that one, the guy who was with me in a room, is a full junkie who don't really want to quit. So that one is gone. The other one is cool but I don't think that we will have a lot in common except the addiction. One guy is also really cool, he don't want to keep using, maybe once a month like me, he just recently called me to ask how I am doing and he really cares about me, he is nearly 15 years older but that don't matters cause I had to go through so much shit that my personality is like a 30 year old guy, not like the other 20-25 years old people. So I definitely will keep in touch with him.

But IDK how I can find new people to make friends with. I know it's hard to find someone with Corona but even after that IDK how to do that. How did you guys found new people?

Also I am still super sad about how it ended with my old friends, for sure I burned alot of bridges but I still want to get back in touch with them. I loved my old best friend so much, he was there for me the whole time when my dad died and he even forgave me that I lied so many years about my addiction, you know he wasn't disappointed from me that I am an addict, he was disappointed that I didn't told him and that I didn't asked for help. Back then I was clean for a few month and relapsed, I still kept in touch and lied again, then I was so ashamed that I slowly stopped the contact. What would you guys do? Would you hit them up again or would you say that it's not worth it? I think even when I hear from them that we can't be friends anymore cause there happened to much, it would be OK but there would be an ending then and now it's like that I don't know anything about our friendship, maybe they would give me a chance again.

I've bought myself a timed tuperware thing, where I can put my opiates in there, and set a timer so I can dose properly and not get enticed into taking more than needed to get rid of WDs.

Obviously tapering is about taking less opiates, but i've heard mixed opinions. Some have said the goal is to lengthen to time between doses. Other posts say to keep the amount in your blood stream consistent throughout the day, but to lower total consumption per day. Which is true? 

My current plan is to wait until WDs start getting bad, take just enough to lower WDs, but not get high, the put my opiates in the timed safe for 12 hours. Do that for a day or two, then lengthen the time to 16 hrs, couple days later 20 hrs, couple days later 24 hrs. Once I get to 36+ hours, I'll try to jump off completely.

Well a combinaton of heavy drinking and refusing to smoking on an oxygen machine. She even set her self on fire one night. Towards the end she was taking higher and higher amounts of morphine. By this time she was in hospess at home. My addiction started watching my mother slowly want to self suicide herself. I couldnt undertsand why she sped up her death. She wasnt strong enough. And those years seeing her like that everyday. Got me tempted to give up on life as well. I tried her morphine. Wasn't for me. Was until i was introduced to herion or more likely fent. By a bad group of friends. Never new what withdrawals were thought it was a joke untill last summer after going hard for about 2 years. I reaches rock bottom going thru precipitated withdrawals.( i took a suboxon to sooon) let me tell you precipitate withdrawals are the worst fucking feelings you could imagine. That day i came out my dad about being addicted. He helped me get thru the precip withdrawls and sober for about 80 days. I did everything right ate healthy worked out. I also smoke weed and take kratom. I reccomend the kratom for anyone like me unable or unwilling to use suboxon or methadone.. Then one night i drink jack Daniels fucked up and relapsed before Christmas. For about a month till i fucked up and did the same mistake again took a sub too early sent me into precip withdrawls. So dejavu i tell my dad and aunt this time so most of my family knows im a fucking junkie. And that weighs heavily on my mind. So i get sober for a month then boom relapsed 3 weeks ago. So here we are must be my 5th or 6th time trying to quit this nightmare. I just wanna feel normal again. I got some ativan and valium from a friend to get thru the 3 day detox of hell. And today is number 2. These 3 days suck. And i never post to reddit. To anyone going thru the same shit. We are all in the same hell fighting different devils.

In addition to taking an internal magnesium supplement, and hot Epsom salt baths, I found the topical spray to be really helpful. Magnesium is readily absorbed by the skin. Here is how I used it:

-Take a hot shower or hot Epsom salt bath

-After you get out and dry off a bit, spray the magnesium onto your body, especially on areas that are very restless/achy. I generally use around 8 sprays total. 

-Some people may experience a little itchiness or slight stinging from topical magnesium (supposedly more so if you are deficient).  If that is the case, try rubbing some virgin coconut oil onto the skin as well, or good quality lotion if you don‚Äôt have the coconut oil. 

-Repeat hot baths and magnesium spray as needed. I do personally apply coconut oil to my skin frequently to keep it from drying out from all the hot baths.

It feels nice don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs like when I first used to take codeine for my migraines in my mid/late teens and I‚Äôd get in bed and could just feel the pain leaving my head and this warm rush come over my brain, only this is about 5x stronger lol. I don‚Äôt know if it is my body starting it‚Äôs natural dopamine production and maybe having a surplus at the time? If anyone else has a name for this or has experience of it then please let me know",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5120502}"

I was talking anywhere from 150-250mg a day. Hot and heavy habit! Over the last 10 days I tapered myself down to about 80mg a day, give or take a few more certain days. I‚Äôve been using high amounts of the Oxy since the first week of Jan. 2021 (New Year) So using Oxy heavily for about 4 months.

Prior to starting on the Oxy in Jan, I had quit Suboxone at the end of Aug 2020. That was BRUTAL! I‚Äôve been off subs for 8 months now, but for my kick tomorrow I‚Äôd like to use subs to get off. Very small amounts tapered over 5 days. Then cut subs off completely. The subs would be just to help me get over the physical acute withdrawals. 
I‚Äôve got a few other comfort meds to get me by just in case. I DO NOT want to take subs long-term again. 


Some questions: 
Has this process worked well for anyone? Tapering subs to lessen acute withdrawals? How did you do it? Did withdrawals ever just come right back when you ended your sub taper? 

Also if anyone has experience or info to share on quitting Oxy I would VERY much appreciate hearing all about it! I‚Äôm SOOO ready for freedom. Ready to crush this and get clean! üí™üèº",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4396797}"
2021-04-24 03:06:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mxep76/stress_from_the_regular_life_and_relapses/,"Stress from the ""regular"" life and relapses.","So, I've been working this new job since last October and everything was going really well up until a month ago. I switched from one department to another at my manager's request (nobody was willing to fill the spot - and looking back now I should have taken that as a hint,) but this new position is stressing me out to no end. 

Not only does the stress make me want to drink heavily to the point of drinking at work, but when I get off I have such an urge to find relief from the stress of the day that I've relapsed 3 times while working this new position that I've only been doing for a month now.

I'm just at a loss of what to do. I truly want to be sober. I feel generally happier and healthier being sober, but I just can't handle this stress.

I'm at a bit of an impasse as well. I just started this new position, and though I can change departments, it may take some time until something opens up. Open positions are applied for internally and go based on seniority by how long you've been employed there, and considering I've only been working there for 5 months, it could take some time before I can transfer out into a new position.

Nevertheless, I just don't know if all of this stress is worth it. I'm making decent money ($16.50/HR with $1 raises every 6 months until capping out at $28) and I have full (GREAT) benefits, but that doesn't really matter if I'm spending that money on alcohol and drugs to cope the only way I know how. I've been getting more and more depressed and discouraged by the day - some from everyday life, but a large part of it is this position.

I just don't know what to do. I really want to just quit this job and focus on my mental health, hopefully find a different job that isn't as stressful and that I might actually enjoy, even if I make less money, but this IS a great job. I'm not too worried financially because I do gig work (food delivery) on the side and I make enough doing that to pay my bills, but I DO need a day job if not just for the consistency, but to appease my probation officer (see below) as well.

I'm a convicted felon and on felony probation for ""attempted transportation of marijuana for sale,"" also known as interstate trafficking, so I'm worried that if i do quit that I may never find a job like this again, or that, at the very least, it may be hard to find something this good again. I mean, never mind the fact that I'm relapsing and using here and there while on probation - that's obviously what should concern me most, but I'm finding it hard to not find this job and ""everyday life"" shit that much more stressful than the probation itself. My probation terms require holding down a day job, but as far as probation goes, I think it's more important to manage my stress as to avoid relapsing and violating by pissing dirty than by potentially violating for quitting my day job without having another one lined up.

Idk. What do y'all think? I'm really struggling here and could use some advice and insight. 

TLDR: New job position at work is stressing me out to the point of using while on probation, and I'm considering quitting because of it, but this is likely one of the best jobs I can find being a felon. I just feel stuck between a rock and a hard place and could use some advice.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4720211}"

2021-04-23 21:10:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mx9kui/lost_everything_everything/,Lost everything .. everything.,"[24M]
I just lost absolutely everything. 
The stupid thing is- I saw it coming too and decided to keep on using knowing full well how it was going to end. 
Last September had a seizure from too much kratom. Parents made me sober up and stop selling drugs to keep living there. So I did just that. Little did they know I had over 30K saved up so I started taking Oxy and Dilaudid because I knew kratom gave me my seizure while Oxy and Dilaudid were okay to take without running that same risk. 
After blowing through 10K up my ass from boofing the stuff I realized I needed to move out in order to keep selling drugs to afford my addiction so fast forward to december I did just that. 
Told myself I would only sell and not use. 
Boy was that ever a lie to myself. 
The day I moved out was the first time in my life I‚Äôve ever moved out. That milestone is supposed to be a happy one for positive purposes, like for normal people they move out after getting a job or something positive like that, but me i moved out to keep selling drugs and keep using drugs. 
From December to February I spent another 15K on pills, basically falling in love with my ‚Äúboof stick‚Äù and romanticizing the process of crushing the little fuckers into dust, mixing them with a bit of water in a container that‚Äôs supposed to hold my blood glucose test strips (I‚Äôm type 1 diabetic), drawing it up into the boof stick plunger, and then proceeding to shoot that foggy juice up my ass only to shortly thereafter nod off with whatever object is in my hand at the time slowly slipping out of grasp as I fade in and out of consciousness sending half-written up texts of jibberish nonsense to whichever unsuspecting loved one I‚Äôd be trying to contact for whatever reason at the time.  

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs okay because I have over 10K left so I‚Äôm all good‚Äù

Now at this point my girlfriend is ready for me to move in with her for March and I‚Äôm thinking to myself at the time ‚Äúthis is my chance to get sober and stop using. Once we move in together I absolutely can not continue to use I have to change‚Äù
So I finish my supply February 27th, move in while withdrawing from a 240mg Oxy / 32mg Dilaudid per day habit and feel like all Satan‚Äôs minions are gnawing at my limbs and mind. 
After successfully moving in, I lasted 3 days before driving her to a night shift. On my way home I stopped through the trap and got myself some more dilaudid to celebrate. Idk what I was celebrating. I already had nothing left to celebrate like the party has been fucking over since highschool but opiates feel better than love in and of itself. 
First month‚Äôs rent in the new place came when I realized I only have 5K left. #Whoops. Paid rent, paid bills, bought groceries, gas for the car, gas for the lungs, gas for my ass.... couple thousand later it‚Äôs April and the process repeats. Now I only have 2K left. What do I tell my girlfriend? The truth. I tell her the truth. 
She‚Äôs as sober as a judge. Never touched drugs in her life. Hardly ever drinks either. Straight edge as straight edge can get. 
With that being said, she knew all along. 
Spent the entire month trying to repair a damaged relationship which the resulting stress kept allowing me to make an excuse to relapse over and over until now. 
Just two days ago I got caught by her again. My boof stick disappeared and I knew I didn‚Äôt throw it out. She confronts me and tells me how much she loves me. But at this point I love her too much to drag her down the hole I‚Äôm in so I allowed her to breakup with me before it gets too serious. 
As a result of my drug use my relationship is gone, next month‚Äôs rent is due soon and I don‚Äôt have the money for it even tho I signed a 1 year lease, and all my life savings are gone now too. 

I need to count my blessings because I am lucky enough that I am able to move back in with my parents under the one condition that I drop the drug selling empire I‚Äôve built for myself. 
I can‚Äôt lie because I will miss it; the days coming home with upwards of $2K in my pocket now dwindled down to $30 total in my bank account. I owe money in taxes too and have student loans so I‚Äôm royally fucked into debt I can‚Äôt climb out of. 
But all I know is that even tho I lost my life savings and a relationship to drugs, I was able to move back with my parents and have a roof over my head. I‚Äôm going to get a job now. A real one. With health & dental benefits. I‚Äôm going to wake up early before 9am and exercise. I‚Äôm going to set goals. I‚Äôm going to spend the next 5 years funnelling paychecks into SPY, BCE, GS, ENB, O, TD, PLBY, GOOGL, JD, and a handful more and keep buying until the day my parents need me to move out again. 
Im going to stay single while I work on my physique and redevelop my sex drive. I‚Äôm going to retrieve my lost passion for playing music and might record guitar videos again (checkout my YouTube channel Popsicle589 for my guitar videos, I used to be really talented before this), and maybe just maybe I can develop a network of sober friends in my area that will uplift me in my career and life goals while holding me back from temptation. 
I haven‚Äôt started any of this yet as I‚Äôm only two days into being moved back with my parents, but I survived a fucking opiate addiction so I get to choose what direction my life goes in next, and with respect to myself and everyone I love I choose betterment. For those of you that know these next words I‚Äôm about to say I tip my hat, because I‚Äôm going to do something we all want to do but a lot yet haven‚Äôt;

2021-04-23 20:34:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mx8za6/life_story/,Life story,"I wrote this post as a comment to a young person struggling with addiction on another post but I like to think we can all gain something from sharing our stories plus it had too many characters to fit as a comment. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the long comment but I couldn‚Äôt help it. You remind me so much of myself, in a lot of ways I wrote this comment thinking about my 20 year old self. I wish I could just give you a hug and tell you everything is going to be okay and that you can do hard things. 

Damn take that comment about seeing myself in you and amplify it by a thousand. I live in Utah and grew up in an LDS (Mormon) household. I didn‚Äôt touch any substances until I was 17, but looking back I was an addict through and through. As a kid my vices were binge eating and video games. I lied constantly to my parents about my grades,homework,chores, anything to put off anything but the fun stuff. 

When I started smoking pot and drinking at 17 it was like I had found the fucking holy grail. I fucking loved pot! I was obsessed, I would hop on Reddit and read for hours about all kinds of drugs. I felt like my eyes had been opened to this whole different reality where drugs weren‚Äôt this evil terrifying thing, they could be enlightening tools! 

From 18-21 I tried anything I could get my hands on, opiates,amphetamines,dissociatives, cocaine, psychs, anything! Plus of course large amounts of alcohol and weed! I also didn‚Äôt practice control of any sort and would indulge myself with large amounts of whatever substance I had gotten my hands on. While my behavior was already showing a very clear pattern, I was in complete denial that I could possibly be doing myself much long term harm or building habits that would hurt me in the long run. 

I remember my freshman year of college my ex girlfriend got her wisdom teeth out. And even better than that, she hated how they made her feel! I told her I would throw them away for her and of course kept them and had myself a nice month. Unfortunately she lived with her grandparents, I took all the pain meds I could find in their cabinets (they weren‚Äôt being used currently but that doesn‚Äôt give me a right to take them)I had probably been using opiates at about the rate you are at right now. Well eventually the stash dried up and it was time to pay the piper. I suffered but I stuck with it and I made it through it. I remember telling myself I couldn‚Äôt touch opiates again because I had no control over them and was just thankful to be feeling more normal. 

I continued all my other drug use and made a habit of drinking far too much everyday. Well at 19 I was placed on probation for 6 months and had supervised drug tests. So I stopped everything but drinking, and very quickly became what anybody would consider an alcoholic. I would buy the half gallon bottle of Seagrams 7 crown (bottom shelf whiskey) and would have it finished in 2-3 days at my worst. I only made it three months of probation before I bought a fake sick and started smoking pot again. 

All the warning signs are flashing at this point, but not using drugs wasn‚Äôt an option to me. It was still this passion/hobby for me that made me feel smart and helped me make friends. At 20 I started buying pressed 30s from the only opiate connect I knew. One day his pill guy got arrested but he told me he knew where we could get black.  Now, I‚Äôm not physically addicted at this point, hell I wasn‚Äôt even unhappy with my life at that point. I still immediately told him I wanted the black. I told myself I had to try it once! Then it became something I did once a week. Then I‚Äôd say fuck it and dose a second and third time that week. I just kept on crossing lines that I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt cross. 

A few months later I was using everyday and was physically dependent. After a year of being a full blown addict I told myself I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this and got clean. The withdrawal was difficult but it was manageable. I was clean for a couple months and met someone who had Dilaudid. It was a rare opiate that I had always wanted. I had to try it and it is most effective intravenously. Even though I‚Äôd never used a needle I was strongly considering it at this point. I didn‚Äôt know how to get my hands on one so I chalked it up to a loss. 
Thanksgiving that year at dinner my diabetic grandfather administers his insulin, hands me the rig and asks me to throw it away. ‚ÄúHOLY FUCKING SHIT, ITS A SIGN FROM JUNKIE JESUS.‚Äù I pocketed it immediately and hit up the Dilaudid plug as fast as I could. I still remember the first time I ever used a needle. I remember the rush of fear and excitement I felt as I saw the red rush of blood in the syringe. I pushed the plunger down and the rest is history. I continued to use Dilaudid this way and a couple months in I started to shoot black too.  

This was the beginning of the darkest three years of my life. I always had a full time job yet I couldn‚Äôt support my habit. It got so bad I would taken Kratom,Imodium, Suboxone, honestly anything I could get my hands on (most days nothing) and go to work as a prep cook. I would suffer for 6-8 hours every day in withdrawal working my ass off so I could get off work pick up a dub to a gram and get well/high for the night. I never had to set an alarm for work at 7 am because I had a natural alarm clock called withdrawal. Every morning I would be woken up by either the chills, restless legs, or cramping in my stomach. If not all three of them. I lived with my mom at the time and she worked in the morning as well. I remember the look on her face every day as she watched the walking dead get up and go into the bathroom to convulse around on the toilet with restless legs and painful spicy shits. I did that shit every day for a year, slowly killing my spirit more each day. I have never wanted suicide more than I did that year. I got really reckless and would shoot up half grams at once because I considered it a win win. On one hand I might get really high, on the other hand I may never have to wake up to this sad existence again. To my disappointment, I  somehow kept opening my eyes each morning. 

Finally I had had enough and came out to my parents and I went to treatment for the first time after that year, only completing a detox program and going back to my old life.  I thought I knew better than anyone who said this wouldn‚Äôt work because I wanted it more. I wasn‚Äôt like all those other addicts in my mind.  The only things I changed was jobs, now I would receive produce delivery orders and put all the produce away in our cooler(lots of lifting heavy boxes in a damn ice box). Well after about a month I relapsed and fell into the same old cycle. I quickly became miserable and six months in I quit my job and went to an inpatient rehab. 

This is where I started to lay the ground work for my recovery. I worked my ass off in that inpatient program. I was always willing to share and was getting some amazing feedback, but I also became very invested in the friends I made there, always asking questions and trying to help them see where they could grow too. I felt so much hope for the first time that I might not die an addict. For the first time in years I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  I still remember the first genuine belly laugh I had in treatment. It seems like such a small thing but it gave me immense hope that I could enjoy life sober. I got out of treatment and came home.

 When I first got home I went to meetings once or twice each day, was spending time with friends and family and feeling good about things. Unfortunately my SO had relapsed while I was gone and I found a needle with black in it. The second I found it I knew I was fucked. I went back out and to support mine and my SOs habit I began selling black. Over the course of the next year I overdosed multiple times, was robbed multiple times, had someone hold a gun to my head, was arrested. And had a friend overdose on my car. I had to pull him out of the car and hold him/his head safe while my so found my narcan. I tried everything to get him to come to, slapped the fuck out of his face, dumped water on him, rubbed his sternum but he just kept getting more blue. My SO found narcan but couldn‚Äôt find a needle to administer it, so I yelled out to her to call 911 then and we will try to figure the needle out after they are on their way. A minute or two passed by even though it felt like an hour watching our friend turn blue. I started to hear the sirens getting closer and prayed it hadn‚Äôt been too long. They gave him narcan and 30 seconds later he popped up, THANK GOD! I had never had someone overdose on me, I immediately felt immense guilt for everything I had put my SO through. My SO found and saved me every single time I overdosed. I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep putting my loved ones through this pain.And that leads me to where I am now.
 I knew I couldn‚Äôt continue fucking around at this point, I don‚Äôt have too many more second chances before something catches up to me.  So I did a fairly quick Suboxone taper at home. I spent the first couple weeks miserable and hopeless.  Finally I used this despair to fuel my hope, I woke up at 7 am and immediately got up and started working in the yard and getting shit done even though it hurt and I felt sick. I haven‚Äôt had a more productive day than that one in years, and I hadn‚Äôt felt pride like I that in years. I finally was waking up to the idea that I can handle this. Since that day I have been working harder than ever to change my thinking and actions and have stayed clean. Showing myself bit by bit that I can do hard things built more faith and confidence in me than I have felt since I started using. I felt this fire inside me that I thought was gone, this hope has given me immense strength to continue this journey and find the happiness I deserve. 

I‚Äôm happy to finally be here but I wish more than anything I could go back to when I was twenty and shake myself violently and yell at myself for going back, I could have stayed clean after that first withdrawal scare in college but I thought I knew better or I would be more diligent about moderation. It‚Äôs just not true heroin doesn‚Äôt discriminate and you can‚Äôt outsmart addiction. You can retrain your brain though, I believe our mindset has a lot to do with how we handle withdrawal symptoms. You have to believe in yourself bro, I believe in you. The fact that your here asking for helping is huge, keep that momentum going! I think that you will be able to handle the symptoms and get through the bad part, and once you start to feel the withdrawal easing up you need to pounce on that motherfucker. As soon as you feel like you have any energy to put towards positive productive work in your life, do it. You will be surprised how happy it can make you and the wonderful things you will learn.

I feel like a real asshole for relapsing super down on myself. Like suicidal ideation craze mode thinking of all the bad shit I‚Äôve done since birth and reliving it in detail.

Like many of y‚Äôall I experienced severe trauma as a child. Dad sexually abused me for years then tried to kill me and my sisters and mom. I‚Äôll spare the details but just reading that anyone would understand I‚Äôm a little fucked in the head.

I‚Äôve done sick amounts of therapy and al that but some scars are just too deep IMO. My next thing is Ayahuasca but that‚Äôs after I get rid of this fucking shit from my body.

So I do like an amount people would probably laugh at. I have a little vial and take tiny tiny bumps from it like the little vial bump thing is maybe 3 needle eyes large and I don‚Äôt fill it up on purpose to try and not do much. I‚Äôm compared to others probably what could be considered micro dosing. Either way I need to stop I know this there‚Äôs no end where I end up being able to use for the rest of my life even though my junkie brain tells me I could.

I‚Äôve been relapsed for like 2 months and in that time have done about 4 grams total still have about one left  ya know in case of junkie brain I wanna flush it and the other sealed back up 5 grams I had on tap, I like to stockpile you‚Äôll pick up on this in a sec.

Anywho WD my first time I was on a fent analog and that shit was fucking hell like I‚Äôve never known so hoping this is slightly easier.

So my stash of shit to get me through -

75 1 mg Xanax
80 10 mg Valium 
50 10 mg baclofen
Like a gallon of GHB for impossible sleep nights

A bag of that absorbic acid vitamin c shit

A onedestron for the hen nausea is unbearable,

 And Dramamine with pepto as well.

With this amount of use and dirty time I‚Äôm really really hoping it‚Äôs not like last time also last time I did it cold turkey so thinking with all the comfort meds I should at least be somewhat better and the vitamin c shit giving it a go.

Also have like 20000 MGS thc pills with has oil and flower to smoke.

Please wish me luck tomorrow at 1 pm begins day 1 for me or a full 24 with no H. Hoping to be at least not a slug by Monday but may call in sick if so. 

I know it‚Äôll be worse if I just do the rest of my shit I‚Äôm prolonging the inevitable. But fuck it‚Äôs tempting. I should just flush this 6 grams right? Like I can‚Äôt be trusted that‚Äôs fucking clear to make wise choices. I think I know the answer here I‚Äôm just seeing the future where I‚Äôm fucking dying Sunday and Monday and beating myself up more for flushing it vs like selling it. I could easily get like 500 for this in less than an hour cause all that‚Äôs here local is fent shit people are dying for real H and paying top dollar. I think that‚Äôs the junkie trying to make this ‚Äúeasier ‚Äú or something I should just fucking flush it but goddamn that seems scary.

So am I over preparing? Under preparing? Should I just stop being a pussy and take my licks cold turkey or use the comfort meds? Maybe just the vitamin c fuck IDK what to do RN.

The first time I took 2 Tramadol, about 7 years ago, I had the most wonderful feeling of happiness. I felt energetic, friendly, and motivated to get things done.

At first, I didn‚Äôt take it every day (mostly because I couldn‚Äôt get it every day) but eventually, I was able, and that was when I first learned there was such a thing as withdrawal. It came as a cruel surprise to me, and I honestly had no idea what was happening, but a little research filled me in, and I realized that since I‚Äôd been using Tramadol daily, stopping would be very uncomfortable.

In an effort to stop the pain and discomfort of withdrawal, if I couldn‚Äôt find Tramadol, I‚Äôd take what I could get.  Over the last seven years, I have taken oxycontin, hydrocodone, morphine sulfate, poppy seed tea, tianeptine, tapentadol, kratom, and loperamide. Whatever I could get to keep me out of withdrawal I‚Äôd take, and I am ashamed to admit that I even raided the medicine cabinets of family and friends, unbeknownst to them.

The worst of it was the poppy seed tea--really good quality seeds--which I was using heavily for about a year (about 2 lbs per day at my worst). But honestly, I think PST was the catalyst needed to get me to quit. Withdrawals from the tea were the worst of them all for me, and included days of vomiting and severe diarrhea, as well as extreme restless body syndrome that kept me awake for days on end.

Toward the end, I got on kratom, which was much less potent, but kept me from feeling total misery. The withdrawals were much less severe at this point, but still, I kept relapsing whenever I would try to quit, and would often resort to 48 to 96 mg doses of loperamide if I happened to run out of kratom.

Finally, on April 5, I took my last dose of kratom, and have had nothing since. I relied heavily on Delta 8 edibles, and was also able to get some actual weed to smoke occasionally (high doses of vitamin C, mineral drops, NAC, valerian root, kava kava, and occasional Robotabs also helped to keep me sane and provide some relief). Interestingly, I used to smoke weed heavily in my early 20s, and enjoyed it immensely. I don‚Äôt know what has changed over the years, but I really do not like it much anymore, but can‚Äôt deny that it helped with my withdrawals symptoms a lot, particularly with sleeping.

Now on day 16, I am getting at least 6 hours of sleep at night, and don‚Äôt have too many acute symptoms anymore. I will occasionally get that RLS feeling (but I never get it in my legs, mainly my arms/hands and abdomen), sometimes I still have chills and feel cold a lot (I hate that tingly cold feeling that rushes over my body at random), digestion is improving, though appetite is still lacking.

My main issue is mood and energy at this point. Anxiety has become a problem for me lately, and gets worse if I smoke weed, so I‚Äôve been avoiding it for several days now. Propranolol helps some, but I also find myself getting dizzy when I stand up, so I have been taking very little of that. My energy levels are bottomed out. Exercise helps a little, but not as much as I‚Äôd hoped. I used to love to craft, paint, create anything, and often had several projects going at a time. Right now, that is unthinkable, and it makes me really sad.  I only have the energy to get essentials done, which means most of my energy is going toward being a mom, working, and caring for our animals (we raise chickens, turkeys, and cattle).

Anyway, this has been my experience, and I just wanted to share on the off chance that it is helpful to anyone. I am also open to advice as far as getting my energy back and improving my mood. I have somehow managed to keep this a secret from my husband, family, and friends, so I am going at this totally alone. Except for you guys of course.

I did my first opiate painkiller when I was 17. Was buying OxyContins 80MG pills by age 19. Could do 5 a day if I really wanted to. And then I moved to a different state for an unrelated reason and just sort of stopped. I tried finding opiates but couldn't hook it up. Eventually I just gave up on it and lived life. I suffer from colitis though and every now and then would get a script of painkillers or IV morphine at the hospital. I never went so far as to try and buy more outside of a doctor though. So from age 20-24, I didn't really do opiates so much.

Then at age 24 everything changed. I eventually stumbled my way onto people who used opiates. What I didn't know was that times changed from 2010 to 2017. Now, you couldn't get Oxys on the streets willy nilly. Now, everyone was doing the hard shit. They were doing heroin. And that just sounded too scary to me. So instead, I'd buy Opanas. It made me feel better and like it wasn't as bad since it wasn't heroin. Little did I know, they're very similar and in a lot of cases, opanas are stronger and higher quality which is why they're so expensive. One night, I was in the process of getting an Opana and the guy with them wasn't home. The middleman who was helping me get it had heroin on him. He let me try it. He also said ""If you want, we can get some of this right now""   


So that's what we did.

I quickly became addicted. But being the logical person I am, I knew it was an issue QUICK. Within a month, I got on Suboxone. And for the next few months, I was good. I was good until one day I was offered some heroin, and did it regardless of the suboxone blocker. Surprisingly, despite it not being that much heroin, I got high despite having taken suboxone that morning. Before I knew it, I was doing it everyday and this time, there was no middlemen. I had a plug this time. That meant I could get big quantities for under the market value. That meant I could use way more than the other addicts around me. I quickly started flaunting the fact that I had large amounts. I become somewhat popular and well known in my town among addicts. I proceeded to make a lot of Fairweather friends. I was so lonely though and in so much pain, that I found comfort in the friends, even though I knew they were only there for my material possessions and resourceful nature.

My family knew that I was spiraling out of control. Within a 30 day period, I was charged with a felony and with possession. I was looking at a few years in prison if I didn't preform a miracle. My family sent me to a rehab in Florida. I wish this was the end of the story but it wasn't.

After I got out of the rehab in Florida, my family set me up with a nice place complete with furniture, and everything I needed for success. 

But I missed the drugs. I missed feeling ""on top of the world"" I missed the Fairweather friends that gave me a sense of importance. So I left the place behind to go back to where I was. Horrible decision. It didn't take long for me to relapse. This time I spent six months using. I ended up in the hospital with an abscess. I wasn't far from death.

Soon after the hospital, I found myself in rehab again. I was determined to be clean. I never wanted to use again. I lost too much. I sincerely meant it too. I had every intention in the world to remain sober. And I would have too, if I didn't run into some of the biggest life stressors a human could go through.

After checking out of rehab, I checked right into a sober living. I wanted to do everything right, with no stone unturned. I NEEDED sobriety. Well, unbeknownst to me, sober living homes are not good places. Oftentimes, the people who run the sober homes are bitterly sober individuals who are miserable. These miserable people have ultimate control over everyone in the house. I was ultimately kicked out of the halfway house for no reason at all other than ""not being a good fit""

If someone who wants sobriety more than anything and will do anything to get there isn't a ""good fit"" then I don't know who is. It became apparent to me that sober living homes are popularity contests. After being kicked out of the halfway house, I suffered a lot. I lived in my car. I worked at a McDonalds and made $200 per week. I made it as long as a month in that misery without using. But after a certain amount of time passed with no progress, I lost hope. I used as soon as I was able to.

That situation showed me that things like homelessness and financial stress are absolutely sobriety threatening issues. No one would help me. I was all on my own. If I was able to access a small amount of capital to help me jumpstart my life, I would have stayed sober. I just needed a place to live, shower, cook, and sleep, and I would have been equipped to build from that.

Finally I got into another halfway house. This time, I did everything I could to not be kicked out. With a little bit of luck, I didn't get kicked out of the next one. That's where I stayed for four months. Eventually, I got my own apartment, where I live now.

I don't like to recognize ""sobriety dates"" or anything like that, but here's how I look at it: As soon as I had my second stay at rehab, that's when my life changed. I've been a different person since then. As far as using, I used when I was homeless and I had four isolated relapses since. At this present time, I'm doing amazing. I love my apartment. I love my two dogs. I'm getting married in September. I take methadone to help me with cravings, and I'm happy. I think it's inevitable that I will use heroin or some kind of opiates again, but it's my hope that I will never ever go back to rock bottom.

I found this ( https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/546030/ ) medical study and thought well fuck it. I'll try it out. I felt better within an hour and slept like a baby for 6. I ate. The weird sweatiness with its horrid smell went away. The body pain reduced substantially, im not sweating or cold, it even helped the headpain ive had for days... I think this is the most balanced my tempature regulation has been in forever. 

There are side effects, feeling light. Foggy in the head. Can't get up too quick cause you can faint. I definitely can tell its inhancing the DXM (I used to drink robo as a teen with friends for fun) but....I almost feel bad for how ""normal"" I feel. Like...not a suffering sweaty mess that can't sleep or eat, like how normal detox is. 

Idk but I literally can't understand why this wouldn't be a go to for detox more often then not then ficking benzos and Tylenol. I know clonidine is used but not as much as it should be. 

I hope this can help someone make it through if they are thinking about going back because the pain and just drawn out strain is too much, or the lack of adequate sleep....

I am kind of new here but I love that theres a community and you guys seem to be really supportive of one another.

Anyway, I'll have a year off meth and heroin in June, and have 8 months sober also off alcohol.. and lately I've been feeling really blah and like I miss drugs. I miss H mostly. I know my life was total trash before (it got VERY bad for me before I stopped..after being an addict for 10 years I finally got clean when I became homeless/living in motels/was completely unlovable and burned all my relationships to the ground). I don't miss that obviously. But I have been super suffering from insomnia, weight gain, and just general lack of energy lately which obviously doesnt help. I am not trying to complain, and I am really happy with a lot of aspects of my life currently. However, I feel kind of like I miss using and I can't shake how guilty I feel for thinking and feeling that way. It wasn't like this before, I was super stoked on my recovery and being clean, but lately I have just been feeling very blah. Has this happened to anyone else? How did you get over it and get stoked again? Any advice is appreciated. Sorry this post is so stupid.

Did fentanyl for 6 months, this was back in 2018 though haven‚Äôt touched it since. I‚Äôve took Kratom for 3 years. The longest period of sobriety I had from Kratom (completely sober) was 7 months ago for 45 days.

So since I‚Äôve had no Kratom for the past 2 days I‚Äôve bought dilaudid. I really hate these fucking pills. I hate taking them. The only reason I‚Äôm taking them is to prevent the Kratom withdrawals. I don‚Äôt like where this is going. Kratom for me is ultimately harm reduction. You can‚Äôt OD on it, isn‚Äôt as harmful as full agonists, I find withdrawals are still rough but half as bad as the harder opioids. Quitting anything for me has always been mostly a mental game. My anxiety just gets so bad, the physical stuff I can handle. Being unemployed even though I apply for countless jobs everyday, im under a lot of financial stress lately. Just scraping by, barely any money to my name. Driving me insane. Depression, anxiety and PTSD have afflicted me for a long time. It‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm always looking for an escape from my demons.

I‚Äôm taking it daily since October 2020. I have tried all usual SSRIs, SNRIs and one MAOI (moclobemide) as well as 2 depth psychological therapies and one behavioral one (I am doing at the moment). Everything without any success...!

That‚Äòs why I started Kratom daily. I‚Äôm also on Amitriptyline since 3 months and it doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything for me even it‚Äôs the gold standard for depression... :( At the same moment I can‚Äòt tell if it really doesn‚Äòt work or if my Kratom use dominates the possible effects of Ami, also if Kratom has really subtle effects for me.

Soon I want to get on a new antidepressant to try. I want to get off Kratom for that one for sure but I‚Äôm worrying that my kratom withdrawals will also make me not notice any effects of the antidepressant at all. 

But I finally want an antidepressant to work for me so I dont have to abuse other substances and drift into this addiction behavior anymore.

So my questions:

1. Is there any antidepressant that is helping with depression and at the same time helping with Kratom/opioid withdrawals? I read that Amitriptyline is, so maybe this one helps me to get off Kratom itself. I don‚Äôt know.

2. If i cold turkey or taper off Kratom for let‚Äôs say am 2 weeks completely off Kratom and sober, Is this enough to be back to baseline normal then and not withdrawing anymore? So I can finally 100% feel and notice the effects of the antidepressant (as I‚Äôm not on Kratom anymore then) if it should work?",0,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5095612}"

So, then i go through all the mental and emotional anguish of WD which kinda is there no matter what. I also was always in treatment going to my IOP 5x per week. Then I had to start working again and couldn‚Äôt manage both. Thought I could drink at work (industry job) since I never liked alcohol. clearly one thing led to another. 

now, im just worried about actually being able to ever make it to or past 45 days. That felt like a lifetime and I was so proud. I want to work in addictions counseling as well so now at some point my mom will have to know as well because she knew I was past a month and was saying only x amount more months until you can start in that field. Well back to square one. And have to tell my best friend that I did not make it to 60 days because he was going to send me something mmj related if I lasted. I hate myself for putting myself in these positions, I just hope I can get through this without my iop... and I know i should probably be doing AA or something but my social anxiety really gets the best of me.

*If I'm ever having cravings or thoughts about throwing my recovery away just so I can get a good nod, I look to this little story I wrote about my days of chasing dope and going on never ending drug runs. If anyone is thinking about throwing their sobriety away, maybe give this a read.*

It‚Äôs 11AM and I'm dopesick. I'm picking up homegirl who‚Äôs about a 15 minute drive from my place. I call her and let her know I'm outside. It takes her 20 minutes to come outside and get in the car.

I've already got 35 minutes invested into this dope run and it‚Äôs barely just started. I strap in and prepare for a long ride.

I ask her where we‚Äôre going so I can enter it into my GPS. She tells me to hold on, gets out her phone, and makes a call.

Being na√Øve about what she‚Äôs doing or who she‚Äôs calling, I assume she‚Äôs calling her connect so see where the meetup spot is. No worries. It‚Äôs always good to plan this stuff, right?

But that‚Äôs not what she‚Äôs doing...

She‚Äôs actually calling around to see *where* we can get something. She doesn‚Äôt even *know* where we‚Äôre getting it from. I thought she had this lined up.

Her plugs don‚Äôt answer. So we sit there while she makes calls and texts people. Decades of addiction have resulted in the decline of her mental faculties; It takes her 90 minutes to complete what would take anyone else 20...

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sweating it out over here, dopesick out of my mind.

‚ÄúMy homeboy knows where to get it‚Äù, she suddenly says. I put the address in my GPS.

‚Ä¶.35 minutes away....

2 hours and 15 minutes invested so far‚Ä¶.

We drive the 35 minutes to homeboy's house. She calls him and tells him we're outside. He tells her he'll be right out. So we wait.

And wait.

And wait.

And keep on waiting.

After twenty minutes, he comes out and gets in the backseat of my car.

Best way to describe him: The embodiment of how the system routinely fails addicts...He‚Äôs tatted up, institutionalized, and hardened. Look at him wrong, and an all out prison-esque brawl is likely to ensue.

Homeboy tells you to drive up the street. You‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôve already been at it nearly three hours. Clearly we‚Äôre driving right to the dopeman and this nightmare is almost over‚Äù

Spoiler alert: It's not close to over.

I get where he told me to go. Luckily, this was just up the street. It‚Äôs a liquor store. He walks in and comes out with a bottle of vodka, gets back in your car, and tells me to drive.

Yup. Unbeknownst to me, I've suddenly become chauffeur to this random ex con. That's funny, I don‚Äôt remember putting an ad in the paper‚Ä¶.

At this point, I'm over two hours in, so I say ‚ÄúHey guys? Where are going to get this and how long is it gonna take?‚Äù

Homegirl says ‚ÄúDude, you asking too many questions. That‚Äôs some cop stuff man""

Homeboy agrees ‚ÄúYo dude don't be sketching me out with all these questions--you sound like a cop. You look like one too, so chill.""

Because apparently saying ‚ÄúWhere are we going and how long is it gonna take to finally get what I came here for?‚Äù Is what cops do.

All I came to do was get dope. So far I've picked up Frick and Frack, drove to and from four different places, and took Frack to the liquor store...and now they're here dumbfounded that I have some questions.

Finally, homeboy tells me to drive to a strip mall. It‚Äôs in the city. That‚Äôs gonna be 45 minutes away.

I knew this wasn't gonna be easy...

I finally get there. I began this dope run in the late hours of the morning and I'm starting to think that by the time it's done, the sun will be setting.

Once I park, homeboy says ‚ÄúAiight, gimme the money.‚Äù I give it to him. He gets out of the car, supposedly to go get the dope.

The insanity of handing money to someone I don‚Äôt know who also has a criminal record is trumped by my body‚Äôs desperate need to ingest opiates. It‚Äôs a risk I'll take for the ultimate reward.

Homeboy hasn‚Äôt come back for about 40 minutes...It‚Äôs starting to sink in that maybe he probably took my money and walked off. Finally he shows back up. I get giddy. I have butterflies in my stomach. I've been dope sick all day, driving aimlessly at the direction of these guys for hours. I deserve this. I earned this.

He gets in the car and I can barely maintain my excitement but I'm able to keep my cool.

‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôd it go? Where‚Äôs the dope?‚Äù

He says ‚ÄúDude wasn‚Äôt home. It‚Äôs a bust.‚Äù

I had cancer in my 20‚Äôs and ended up with chemotherapy-induced toxicity, which caused widespread bone-like pain all over my body.  My oncologist had me on 30g of Methadone (I was on several other opioids previously during my treatment) before handing me off to pain management for the last several years.  I always just assumed I‚Äôd be on Methadone for the rest of my life, but 11 days ago, I was pulled off because my PM doctor was retiring.  I wasn‚Äôt given support meds until day six because the main Nurse Practitioner was on vacation.  I was told by the substitute NP that if it got too bad just to go to the ER, which felt like a giant fuck you.  Untilmately, I just suffered through every single symptom on every list I read. By day six, my NP was back and I ended up finally receiving some Clonidine, five days of Ambien, a refill of Zanaflex, and a suggestion to use Melatonin before trying Ambien.  She will be calling me in two days from now to see where I‚Äôm at and where we will go next, but because I‚Äôve come so far, didn‚Äôt want to just put me back on the Methadone.

I don‚Äôt think I need to tell anyone here the hell I went through.  Now on day 11, I‚Äôm able to take Tylenol/Advil every 8-hours and at night I take a Clonidine, Zanaflex, and 6mg of Melatonin and I can sleep a bit now.  

All in, I think I‚Äôve been on opiates for 12 years, or something close to that. 

I guess I have some specific questions I‚Äôm hoping someone could answer:

1.	From what I understand of all of this is that the biggest issue is dopamine withdrawal.  I ordered a supplement  that‚Äôs a dopamine booster (Uridine Monophosphate, Mucuna Pruriens, L-Theanine, Tyrosine). Is this safe to take?  The anxiety is bad, but so is the empty, wet dishrag feeling. 
2.	I‚Äôve been exercising but I feel so weak.  Is this normal?
3.	I feel more physically numb and weird in my muscles than I did when I was on Methadone. 
4.	Is the pain I feel now real or withdrawal?
5.	Does PAWS happen to everyone?

Honestly, Methadone was a huge lifesaver for me. It gave me the mobility back that I lost during my cancer treatments.  It made me ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  But, I really hated that someone was able to turn my entire world upside-down like that.  I had to take off work while hiring for help. (I‚Äôm ten years in at my company, so I‚Äôm lucky to have had that freedom, but they didn‚Äôt know that and didn‚Äôt really seem to care).  I don‚Äôt know that I could just go back to that. 

I‚Äôm also going back to work tomorrow and I‚Äôm finding myself not giving a shit if the company fell apart tomorrow. üòî

This last time getting clean was HELL. Doing mostly what I guess was fentanyl. 3 trips to detox before I could get past withdrawal. Subutex and suboxone were giving me precipitated wds up to 7 days after getting high. After I detoxed that last time I did 60 days of inpatient. So glad I did as I finally got to a place physically where I could work on my recovery. I got on suboxone AFTER detox. 2mg/day. I had to. Otherwise I would be in serious discomfort for the entire time. I chose the easier softer way and it actually worked. Kinda. 
I wrote a 4th step while in treatment Talked to a sponsor everyday. Started taking prozac and by the time I was discharged I felt great and was ready,  as my sponsor would say, "" to do AA "". I never told my sponsor about being on suboxone. Justified it by telling myself it's a medical issue.
I get home and throw myself into AA like never before. Taking my suboxone every other day 2mg. Going to meetings and making amends. I even got a job lol. A menial job that according to my sponsor was primarily "" to keep me busy and becoming self supporting through my own contributions. "" aaaaaaaand that's when the trouble started. 
I get off the prozac and start cutting down on seroquil ( forgot to mention I take that for sleep ). I start making less meetings. The new job is taking more out of me than Id ever imagined. No relief, making meetings was harder, not seeing my son and gf as much, making mistakes on the job...etc.
I start realizing I feel better on days when I took my subs. I switch up meds more. And then one day I just go crazy. I wake up and email my manager that I won't be returning to work. I did it in a cowardly fashion. I didn't return her phone calls etc 
That was 12 days ago. Since then Ive felt awful. Avoiding people, not letting people know what happened,  going to different meetings. Copping resentments left and right. Can't go 45 minutes without doing something stupid. 
I start taking more suboxone. I want to get high so badly but I know where that road leads. I've stopped praying. I'm no longer talking to my sponsor because I'm so embarrassed what I did with quitting that job. I can get a new sponsor and a new job but I don't know if I'll survive a relapse. Maybe I have 'relapsed' already by abusing the subs. Either way Ive made a lot of progress. To throw it all away by using dope would be death or worse  No idea what I should do.

I‚Äôve been using opiates mostly heroin since I was 15 I‚Äôm now 32. I was born with a host of medical issues so my first hit really came at 2 and maybe that has something to do with my chemical dependency. 

Last Sunday I took my last hit of heroin after relapsing in August. I spent about about 12 thousand USD or there abouts since then which isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôve been taking sub since Wednesday. I‚Äôve worked my way through an 8mg strip and started a second I took maybe 2mg yesterday and 1mg today and all I can think right now is taking the next 7 in one hit. 

I live with my wife and we happened to be going out of town this weekend. Part of the reason I wanted to kick was to leave town without the monkey on my back.

She knows I‚Äôve struggled with it but she doesn‚Äôt know about this relapse, I‚Äôm a pro at hiding my using and meth keeps me from nodding out.

I‚Äôm sitting here drinking with her family and I feel like her grandfather can see another junkie has infiltrated the family and all I can think about is taking a sub to feel better, feel something, anything except this god awful anxiety. I should flush but I‚Äôm too damn weak.

Are you less, are you less, are you sick, chemically obsessed? Obviously yes, a total mess, given up there‚Äôs nothing left. Still see in rainbows but it‚Äôs a faded hue, and sunsets, songbird‚Äôs lullabies- nothing‚Äôs the same to you. Youll never reach it, you‚Äôll never see it, you‚Äôll only just begin to toe the tip tip tip of the iceburg sinking,sinking, sinking far lower than the one that murdered the titanic. Deny that you‚Äôre manic, deny that you‚Äôre empty, deny every part of what they‚Äôre expecting. Do the best you can to fool that you do what they‚Äôre expecting, but never, never think about forgetting where you belong, and with whom. Darkness raised, clothed, and bathed you, you owe more than you‚Äôve got, and soon enough your payment‚Äôs due. Should you regret any of it, telling anyone is the last thing that you should do. Just keep hiding, keep driving, further and further from where you started. Leaving a note is irrelevant, and maybe that‚Äôs heartless but at least you‚Äôre being honest. The dawn is upon us, and you never went to sleep. The cricket‚Äôs song looped something endless and you conciously dreamed. There are things that you see that you‚Äôre not sure if you should believe, but they seem so fucking real, as in really really. Lost in your own head, what were you looking for in the first place? You lost yourself in the first place.

    Reflection, reflected, the infection infected every cell underneath and then on top of your skin. Breathe in, but it‚Äôs hollow, soft like a marshmallow and it will only get softer and softer ‚Äòtill it‚Äôs just goop tomorrow. A bet on the fact you would never even notice- well that would be quite a good wager indeed. They could sell tickets, they could sell first row seats to the woe of your tragic, self inflicted defeat. You could be the star of some morbid reality TV, then again who would ever wanna see you slumped over 22 hours of the day, head filled with nightmares in your fitful sleep. You can‚Äôt even escape in your dreams. You know deep down you might really just hate this, but you don‚Äôt want to stop and you don‚Äôt know what that means.

    Your mother stays up praying that you keep yourself well, that you make better choices and stay far from the sirens calling you back down to hell. You don‚Äôt believe in God or his son, or whatever the holy ghost is supposed to be, and your mother insists that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre always lonely. The thought does persist (occasionally) that you only still exist because someone who loved you believed. Loved you dearly, and spent her energy making sure you were protected. In some ways, religion doesn‚Äôt have much to do with it. Ask and receive, law of attraction- perspective‚Äôs a thing, so what you don‚Äôt agree that the guy in the sky‚Äôs got an army on wings. There is some force, somewhere protecting you from snapping your strings as you play marionette to the foulest of things. Most don‚Äôt condoe lies, but they should in this case. You‚Äôre always high, but she can‚Äôt tell from  your face.

There is no real reality, there is only the reality each of us knows to be. What is known to you? The wreckage, calamity, the ruins of who you used to be? Who you might‚Äôve been? No use in nostalgia for what never happened, stay warm and content in the sin that you‚Äôre wrapped in. Chase the bliss that you‚Äôre convinced you didn‚Äôt imagine, dance to the melodious hiss as you follow the dragon. Up where the clouds are, and so far you‚Äôve been right- there is no God, no angels, no heaven in sight. Not even a gas station or general store when you stop at cloud nine. Just cold, puffy white, fog so thick it takes 5 tries to get your cigarette lit. For a moment you think, fuck it. You jump from the fluff where you sit.

Funny thing is the falling, it really just feels the same as you‚Äôve felt every day. What‚Äôs funny too, is that the rain hits hits your face in a horizontal way, and that‚Äôs something new.

anyways 

i apologize if i sound dramatic i‚Äôm just rly goin thru it right now and need to vent. i should also preface this with that i have only been in super super toxic, abusive relationships basically my entire fucking life. TLDR at the bottom. 

so i finally met someone who i really connected with, and fell for him super quickly. i met him almost a year ago at a rehab i was in (üö©), and he grabbed my attention almost instantly. but he had a girlfriend at the time (üö©) and i was sort of seeing someone as well, so we respectfully kept our distance. unfortunately, he had been there longer than me, so he had to leave on my 5th day there. but, we spent those 5 days really getting to know eachother. and if you‚Äôve been to rehab, you know that 5 days is a lot to get to know someone lol. 

we connected on sooooo many things. we both had studied criminal justice, had a passion for writing, loved tattoos, and so much more.. we had very similar goals in life... like, it felt like all the stars were aligned when we talked. he also had his shit together, had his own fucking business and career and it was so attractive to see someone so put together. obviously he struggled with addiction(üö©) but it seemed like he had a minor slip up in his life and he was really trying to get back on track. i also knew he had a girlfriend and i was technically in a relationship as well, so i tried really hard to just keep in friendly. 

on his last night there , he gave me a journal that said ‚Äúfor your coin out‚Äù. a coin out journal is something some people have to pass around on your last day in rehab to sign to say goodbye/ leave your number type of stuff. he had wrote pages and pages confessing how he felt, how in 5 days i had made him felt more than in the relationship he had been in for more than 7 years. after he gave it to me and i read it, i sat and talked with him until 4am and told him that i really liked him as well. although nothing happened that night, we promised we‚Äôd see eachother outside of rehab. 

unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt talk for a couple months after he left. he was in a relationship still, and i was still in and out of treatments and really struggling. he also lived in another state. we talked on and off after he left, but nothing like the nights we had in rehab.
up until about 5 months ago, he was out of his relationship and i was out of mine. we started calling eachother and talking every single day. although i was still in rehab, he seemed like he got his shit together again and was doing great. 

we had made plans for him to fly out and visit me, but a couple days before that happened, he had a slip and relapsed. he told me if he were to relapse, that he would distance himself completely so i wouldn‚Äôt see him during his use. we have the same doc, and he didn‚Äôt want to trigger me in anyway, which i respected. it really hurt me that he relapsed, but i understand that it happens and he needed his space.
he ghosted me for about a month, then started talking to me again and said he was clean now and apologized for leaving. 
 
since then, we talked every single day. he was taking a trip to hawaii and was going to fly me out with him for a little vacation. before that though, he was planning on flying down this weekend to where i live and meeting my family. he had his plan ticket booked, i rented us a car and got us an airbnb to stay at. 

now 3 days before he was going to fly down here, he calls me and says he has to cancel everything. he said he had to get ‚Äúemergency surgery on his heart‚Äù. and has completely ghosted me again. honestly, although i feel terrible saying this, i‚Äôm having a really hard time believing that. this is now the second time he canceled a trip that‚Äôs been thoroughly planned. but this time, he didn‚Äôt say he relapsed, like he did last time. and now i can‚Äôt get ahold of him... 

is it wrong of me that i‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs lying about his surgery...? it just doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me.
idk. i feel like if he did relapse he would have told me.
sorry for the long ass rant

TLDR: guy i‚Äôm pretty much in love with has now ghosted me twice, days before a thoroughly planned trip together. this was the first relationship that has been remotely close to ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. i know there‚Äôs a lot of red flags in this shit. i‚Äôm used to being abused both verbally and physically and no none really giving a fuck about me. i really liked this guy. i‚Äôm hurt.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46994215}"

I would get a strip and take tiny little pieces just to get that high feeling, then stop for a few days and then do it all over again in attempts to avoid getting addicted. One strip would last me over a month.
Well my family and I moved across the country so I decided to get 15 strips from my connect before we moved and just hoped for the best (full addict mode thinking I could control it) 
Now here I am, 3 strips left and a year and a half later.... I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs normal to be taking such a small amount over a year and a half time line...I take one tiny piece of the strip every night or every other night, it fluctuates...it helps me sleep and get through the night without restless legs.
But I will be completely out soon, and I‚Äôm panicked that the withdrawals are going to be so terrible and miserable that I will go looking on the street for drugs...and other than this Suboxone bullshit that I‚Äôve been suffering with in silence for the last year and a half I haven‚Äôt relapsed with any other substances. I never want to go back to that, I was an IV heroin user for 8years, 
Now my life is completely different...night and day, I‚Äôve actually got my shit together outside of this secret Suboxone baloney.
So I‚Äôm preparing- I‚Äôm trying to get educated and prepare for this withdrawal and try to do it at home without my family noticing ( maybe I‚Äôll say I have COVID?!) 
I ended up finding an old script for gabapentin 600mg, there‚Äôs 15.. I‚Äôm hoping that will help.... stocked up on random vitamins that probably won‚Äôt do shit....thinking maybe I will make a trip to the doctor to try to get muscle relaxers to help with the muscle pain when the dresses day arrives.... 
but I need to know if there are any helpful tips...and if anyone else has ever maintained on such a small does like I have, and if they have- what we‚Äôre withdrawals like???

Currently tapering from a 300 mg ODSMT a day habit (100mg 3x a day) and CLAM BENZO FOR SLEEP PANICK AND ANXIETY (TAPERING THAT TOO. 

ITS April 15th and the vacation is june 12th through the 19th. I hope to be tapered or off the opioids by then but not banking on it. Going down 5-10 mgs on each of the 3 doses a day. 

My family is starting to question why i dont get cheap tix and fly instead of driving. I have 2 kids and just bought a si spacious in good condition suburu forester to fit them for the trip, might get a u haul or top carriage for luggage. 

My question is 2 parted. Since im assumng il still be dependent on these rc opis and benzos what the best course of action is.

Could i go to a doctor and be honest and say im dependent on these controlled substances and want to beon pharma safe drigs as a replacement and taper under doctor supervison? Could i say i have this vacation and need to switch to tramadol and a prescription benzo so that i could legally frly with perscriptions? 

Or sinces its not an international should i risk somehow smuggling odsmt and clonazolam (enough for the vacations length) onto the plane somehow? Or should i say fuck it and drive with my two kids and wife and use the excuses like ""i like roadtrips, want to see the country, dont want crying kids on the plane etc""

This is giving me horrible anxietu and june is fast approaching. Any advice is much appreciated PLEASE HELP!!

TL;DR 
Dependent and tapering off odsmt opioid and benzo colonzolam and want to know my options. Way i see them are as follows

1: be honest with a doctor and attempt to get legal prescriptions for tramadol (odsmt replacement) and ativan or xanax (CLAM REPLACEMENT) So i can fly with legal prescriptions

2: smuggle my illegal RCS on a plane from Indiana to colorado (is this safe or will i definately be busted? Any tips on getting these drigs through the flights cross country? 

Or fuck it and drive my family losing time for actuall vacation back and forth.

About 14 years ago my boyfriend and me started using 10mg of whatever pain pills we could get. After about 4 years of that we started doing 30mg of Rs regulars not pressed. Fast forward through 5 years of a million calls to dealers and tons of money spent that we honestly didn't have. 

We had our child in about the 2nd year of this. I tapered down to quit when I got pregnant but stupid me started back as soon she was born literally doing lines in the bathroom of the hospital. She is around 3 years old when we get arrested for stealing because we didn't have money. My boyfriend went to a clinic and started getting subutex and we split his prescription. 

Now it's been almost 6 years and we were still doing them. His doctor never tried to taper him down or cut his dose. Well 3 weeks ago his doctor up and disappears the clinic shuts down. We were terrified knowing now how bad subs are to withdrawal from so we find suboxone to keep us going. I think something snapped in my boyfriend and he decided we were going to stop. So he bought 70 10mg hydro and we did those for 5 days. Now we are on day 5 of nothing and I feel almost normal again. He doesn't but he has a bad back from  a car accident years ago so he is a ton of pain.

Am I asking too much of myself? Didnt tell my doc I was cold turkey. Told her I wanted to go off asap. MD suggested going back to 16mg/day and titrating 2mg  every 2 weeks. But that's just seems ridiculously slow.

2021-04-14 08:12:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mqp8tg/fent_taperdetox_advice/,Fent taper/detox advice,"So, my girl and I been using since beginning/mid December. East coast USA. All the dope is fent. I‚Äôm up to about 1-1.5 bundles a day. She‚Äôs up to about 1.5-2. Both of us just sniffing it.

Long story short, we started getting it as it was cheaper than pills, and she needed it for pain relief. I just started testing it before giving her any since it‚Äôs all so strong, and I‚Äôd rather something happen to me than her. Kept on using tho cause I have an addictive personality. 

We‚Äôre both trying to get off it now, as we‚Äôre barely scraping by with bills and such.

The guy we buy from, he doesn‚Äôt put it in separate bags. It‚Äôs just 250mg per ‚Äúbundle‚Äù, so I‚Äôm up to say about 300mg/day and she‚Äôs up to about 440mg.

I know eventually we‚Äôre gonna have to be sick. She‚Äôs especially anxious about it, and I‚Äôm trying to be reassuring that we can taper down some. I‚Äôve read through so many posts here on how to deal with withdrawals and on tapering and methadone and subs. Just don‚Äôt know where to start.

Initially I was thinking we could decrease our ‚Äúdoses‚Äù like 10% a week. If we started on a strict dosing schedule or something. Like for me, every 2 hours use 25mg (total 300mg/day) for a week, then the next week 22.5, then 20, etc. Is that even feasible or is that just gonna cause withdrawals right off the bat anyway? I‚Äôm more concerned for her than myself.

We‚Äôve got some methadone bottles from a friend that wasn‚Äôt taking it, as well as some subs from a friend that wasn‚Äôt taking them. Thinking of picking up some kratom as well. Unfortunately clonidine isn‚Äôt an option, as it‚Äôs prescription only in the US.

I‚Äôve been trying to talk her into going into a detox but she‚Äôs afraid they‚Äôll contact DCF as we have a kid. We‚Äôre not bad parents. We‚Äôre really careful to make sure nothing is left around, and we clean everything up after using. Neither of us even get to the point of nodding except me a few times when testing it and it was stronger than expected. She‚Äôs legit using it for pain, and I‚Äôm careful enough to avoid using too much to where I can‚Äôt function as well. The friend that gave me the subs insists that it‚Äôs treated as a medical thing, not a drug thing.. that if you‚Äôre actively seeking help, they just want to help you and won‚Äôt contact DCF, but that she could just leave out the fact that she has a kid if she was worried, but she still doesn‚Äôt wanna go. I unfortunately don‚Äôt have the option of going as I don‚Äôt have insurance atm.

Been too scared and embarrassed to ask for help, but I‚Äôm finally 10,000% ready to commit to getting clean because I want to start a family.

I feel my backstory is important in understand the obstacles I‚Äôm facing so here goes. 

I‚Äôm an opiate user and have been for 10+ years now. It all started when I had a back injury in high school and was prescribed pain killers. Then realized how fun the good ole OC 80s were in college and it was all downhill from there. I was recreationally using blues for years. Then it became an every day habit. I‚Äôm talking 6+ years of every day use. Then the pandemic hit and you couldn‚Äôt find anything. The city, hell the north half of the state, went dry. So seeing as how I was a daily user, the withdrawals came quick and hard. In a desperate search to kick the hanks, my plug told me H was all he had, but it‚Äôs basically the same. Right? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever believed and/or done in my life. But here I am now, a daily heroin user. My god, that‚Äôs hard to admit and put out there, but if anyone will understand I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs you guys. 

Here‚Äôs where things get messy. I‚Äôm in the healthcare field. I‚Äôve been a nurse for almost 8 years now. When I first started nursing I was able to quit long enough to pass my drug screen and get a job, but then my use became daily and now I can‚Äôt go more than 6-8 hours without. At this point, I‚Äôm using to keep myself afloat. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúweaning myself‚Äù and I‚Äôm down to doing about 2-3 points a day. Now I only use when I‚Äôm feeling the withdrawals come on or when I‚Äôm bored. When I do use it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm tootin a big line to get to feeling good like I used to. Matter of fact, I don‚Äôt even remember the last time I nodded or even felt high at all. It‚Äôs literally just to keep from sweating to death or getting stomach cramps at work. 

There‚Äôs only a handful of people who know about me using. I have no idea how I‚Äôve made it so long as a ‚Äúfunctioning addict‚Äù and kept everyone from catching on or catching a charge. My husband is aware and willing to do anything and everything under the sun to help with the process. He‚Äôd rope the moon for me if he could. God bless him, he‚Äôs a saint. But now we are ready to start a family. Can‚Äôt have a baby when I‚Äôm on any type of drugs so I have to be 100% clean from anything and everything.

As far as the planning goes, I am able to take 10 straight days off work without taking any vacation or 17 straight days off using only 2 vacation days. Pretty legit schedule, I know haha I‚Äôm hoping this will be enough time to get straight enough to function again and get back with my coworkers being none the wiser. The issue I‚Äôm having is that I can‚Äôt enter any program or see any doctor for meds like suboxone because of my field of work. I‚Äôm terrified that they will somehow find out and I‚Äôd lose everything. This is my dream career and I CAN NOT lose my job or have anyone else find out. I also have the ability to obtain 8mg suboxone strips, probably 20 or so at the beginning of each month, and currently have 10 or 11 of them in my possession. 

So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with. I want to hear all of your advice on what to do. Should I just go cold turkey and embrace the suck? (I‚Äôve tried this before, twice actually, and failed miserably. After 24-36 hours I cave and I‚Äôm willing to do ANYTHING to feel better and make the pain go away.) I‚Äôm not really interested in trading one addiction for another so I‚Äôd rather not commit to being on subs long term. I‚Äôm willing to use them to help in the beginning, but that‚Äôs about it. So should I try to wean myself down more and then take part of a sub to help with the symptoms? I guess I just don‚Äôt know how to take the leap and actually start quitting haha If you‚Äôve made it this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to hear the details and any advice/thoughts are welcome!

TL;DR I finally want to kick a daily H habit. What‚Äôs the best way for me to get clean? I have roughly 10-14 days to accomplish as much as possible without missing work. Cold turkey? Aided by subs? Subs for a short period, like a month or so? Help! What worked for you? Any advice?",2,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.575786}"

This is kind of a rant kind of a cry for advice. Any suggestions help.

Some backstory, I am an 18 y/o female who‚Äôs been in active addiction for two years. About a week and a half ago I intentionally overdosed on fentanyl and a heroic dose of alprazolam. Had a stroke and hit my head really bad. I‚Äôm a straight A (not accounting this last week) university student who just needs advice or general suggestions. 

Really this past week has been hell. I am currently withdrawaling from my two year long opiate and benzo addiction. So far 2 days clean from fent and a week and a half clean from benzos. Right now I‚Äôm trying to manage my symptoms (hot flashes, insomnia and nightmares, restless legs, vomiting, HELLISH anxiety) while trying to figure out how to pick back up on school work. 

I have no idea where to start. I haven‚Äôt done any assignments for school in about two weeks and I am afraid to even open my computer. Dropping classes is not an option, for I am up to my neck in 8 classes this semester. My family doesn‚Äôt know what happened although they do know I have been struggling with depression. I am out of money, out of resources, really just in a bad spot. 

Every day feels like hell and it only gets worse as the days pass by and I have no work to show. I haven‚Äôt been eating (currently at 98 pounds..) and my anxiety is off the rails. I have really good medical insurance through my dad though, so seeing a medical professional is in the question. 

What do I do? How do I get my shit together? I‚Äôm just scared and the lack of sleep and cold sweats aren‚Äôt helping. I was going to go to the hospital for the stroke but I was disoriented and kept putting it off. The days starting running together and now its been nearly 2 weeks without getting an MRI or CT scan. I have noticed a lot of mental dissonance along with holes in my short term memory.

All I have to take the edge off the withdrawal is melatonin and tylenol. I have gone cold turkey from heroin in the past so I am familiar with the timeline. I am merely scared this time around due to the recent stroke and the combined CT from alprazolam. Everything just hurts. I have no drive to begin attending my classes again. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to get better? 

P.S., I apologize if this post is a bit jumbled or unclear. I don‚Äôt mean to ramble on too much.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8822205}"

I have a question, has anyone used Espranor to come off opiates. It‚Äôs a wafer like tablet that dissolves on the tongue. I‚Äôm using it. It‚Äôs been mainly a good experience so far. I‚Äôve not gone back to my DOC (codeine and morphine). I stabilised on 14mg of Espranor. I take it once in the morning and it lasts for 24 hours. I started this on 28th December and I did my first reduction two weeks ago and am now on 12mg. I intend to reduce down another 2mg in the next couple of weeks. 
I just wanted to hear other people‚Äôs experiences with it as I‚Äôd not heard it mentioned on here. I‚Äôm in the Uk and under a drug rehab clinic. I‚Äôm having weekly therapy phone calls.

I couldn‚Äôt quit cold turkey due to pre existing health conditions but I‚Äôm proud that I‚Äôve got this far and with how good I feel (so clear headed, less anxiety as I don‚Äôt run out of opiates anymore).

After an overdose and another fuck up I decided I needed to get real help and went back to the ER and went to medical detox for 7 days. To be honest, I can‚Äôt even count those 7 days as clean time due to the crazy amounts of phenobarbital they put me on (that‚Äôs a long story in itself I will save for later). I‚Äôm happy to report that i completed detox, I‚Äôm back on Vivitrol, have 3 days clean, and started intensive out patient treatment yesterday. This past month has been the scariest relapse ride of my life and I am ready to get off that ride and start doing some living again.

I‚Äôve been told ‚Äúforget the mistake but remember the lesson‚Äù but I really don‚Äôt ever want to forget any of this pain I‚Äôve endured. This disease of addiction is so god damn progressive, insidious, cunning, and baffling and its really fucked me up. I don‚Äôt know why or how I survived my overdose but I‚Äôd like to spend some time living and maybe I will figure out why I am still here with my heart beating. 

If any of you are thinking about relapsing or already relapsed and haven‚Äôt lost everything, I‚Äôm here to tell you that you don‚Äôt have to lose it all to get help. Call someone and get the help you need. Unfortunately I‚Äôm a stubborn addict and it took an overdose, hurting my loved ones again and again, and little bit more to get the help I needed. I hope you can learn from my own mistake so you don‚Äôt have to repeat it. 

I‚Äôm so grateful to be alive today and given another (I must be on my 10th life by now) chance at this. I know I have a lot of issues to work on but right now I am just focused on not using.

I was on suboxone maintenance for 8 years prior to my relapse so even doing 20 bags a day barely gets me buzzed yet my life revolves around it and I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôm unable to quit on my own without professional help.

Anyway after a few failed at home detox attempts I decided to just bite the bullet and go for inpatient. I currently work in a small understaffed cafe where even one sick day results in chaos, I‚Äôm dreading telling my boss. I really like the job and hope to come back to it after if possible so I‚Äôm wondering- *what‚Äôs a good cover story to explain a months absence?*

Chances are I‚Äôll lose my job but it‚Äôd be nice to leave on good terms and have a shot of working there again in future. (I‚Äôve basically fucked over every other cafe/restaurant in my city over the past 15 years so it will be tricky finding new employment. Plus I love my coworkers, get great hours, and tips average $120-$150 a week.)

I‚Äôm thinking of saying something along the lines of I‚Äôm on a medication for _____ and need to be hospitalized to safely go off of it.

 Im only 6 days clean off a 600+mg a day codeine habit (weak opioid, but opioid nonetheless) that I've developed over the past few years that started off recreational and I eventually graduated to morphine.

Just wanted to share to help any others who are just beginning recovery, if you are having cravings or feel like you want to use, what really helped for me is trusting that the future will be brighter without the pills. The addict in your brain will come up with any excuse  ""it's ur day off, u deserve to just chill, have some pills and be comfy in bed"" , ""it'll only be one dose it won't set you that far back"", ""this WILL be the last time you'll order any"".

It's really scarrey, and it's almost like you've tripped off a cliff edge and are hanging off the side of this huge mountain.  You know you need to let go and fall off into the unknown so that you can get back to those that love you, but the addict inside comes up with  all kinds of lies and promises to get you to keep clinging on and stay at the top. You get scarred, not sure if what awaits you down below - water, the bush, rocks - is survivable or even worth it. 

I felt like I was at the cliff edge when the pack of morphine showed up, and with the support of my amazing  boyfriend and reading some of your experiences in this forum , something in me told me to let go and fall down into the unknown, but trusting that whatever is waiting on the other side will be worth it and and will be better.

I figured I would share with those who can relate. Currently 4 months clean on April 8th.," I've been using writing to help with sobriety and been writing about different life experiences I've had.  This one was hard to write and I still haven't reread it.

&#x200B;

It was a cloudy day one Sunday in the first half of April, and there was still plenty of snow on the ground from our insane winter that year.  over 100 inches of snow over a couple months.  My dealer pulled up to my house and I jumped in his car to do the tour of the neighborhood while we made the exchange of money for dope.

‚ÄúHey, we gotta scoop.‚Äù He said.

Fuck.  I hated this, I just wanted my shit and I wanted to go home.  This meant we had to go into the city and play the waiting game.  These guys would make us wait for so long sometimes, several hours even.

As we pulled into the city he made the call.

‚ÄúHey Papi, where we going?‚Äù

He gave us a location in a dirty part of the city next to one of the Tech schools.  He didn‚Äôt make us wait that long, he was ready for us.  As we rounded a corner we saw his runner and pulled up.

‚Äú How many?‚Äù  These guys usually didn‚Äôt exchange pleasantries.  They wanted to get the fuck out just like we did.  I‚Äôd hear stories of them getting robbed, and not all of them carried guns or weapons so it wasn‚Äôt hard to do.  The problem is that once you rob them then you have them after you - that‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt want.  We all knew they carried everything in their cheeks in case they had to swallow it really quick, so if you mace them they‚Äôll naturally spit it all out.  At least that was the best way to rob them.

‚ÄúFive.‚Äù

He spit out five bags for us that he would keep tucked in his cheek like a squirrel.  ‚ÄúHere.  Put it in your mouth.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt.

We kept driving for a bit following his directions on where to drop him off.  Passing these huge mounds of snow from our crazy winter he‚Äôd finally tell us to pull over at a corner and drop him off.

Finally.  Now we could get high.

My dealer breaks open a bag and cuts up a line on his plastic tray he had for keeping his checkbook.  I‚Äôve never seen these trays before, and who the fuck even writes checks anymore?  I guess he was putting it to good use regardless, he knew how to drive and snort a line pretty well.

It took a little bit more time for me because I was shooting it.  I had to fiddle with the bag a bit before I could get past the knot.

‚ÄúOh what the fuck dude.  This bag is tiny!‚Äù

It looked like it was about half what it should have been, and it looked a little more pale than usual.  But it still smelled like that painfully vinegary shit I‚Äôd always get.

I mixed about half of that bag into my water bottle cap with about 30units of water.  Standard procedure.  I had an extremely high tolerance so normally I would do a full bag or close to it.  One bag would get me at a good level for a while, and I‚Äôd always save one for the night and following morning.

I pulled a piece of cotton from a cigarette but so I could suck the dope up through it as a simple filter.  Usually I‚Äôd have a cotton swab on me or something but this would do well enough.  Once I had everything ready I was prepared for the sweet relief.

When you‚Äôre sick from heroin withdrawals it feels like you have the worst flu you‚Äôve ever experienced mixed with panic attacks and a stomach bug.  It‚Äôs hell.  As soon as that drug enters your bloodstream its instant relief.  Imagine having horrible body aches, feeling restless with no energy, and vomiting uncontrollably, but as soon as you take this one substance you feel perfectly normal within about 5 seconds.  Debilitating illness to a day at the beach.

I had no problems hitting a vein.  I didn‚Äôt need to tie off and the car didn‚Äôt need to be stopped, I was very efficient.  As soon as I injected it, it felt a little different.

I didn‚Äôt feel the usual high, but it also wasn‚Äôt unfamiliar.  I didn‚Äôt feel my body totally relax, but instead I just felt pins and needles running through my entire body as the drugs would spread through my blood.

‚ÄúThis shit is weak.‚Äù I said.  I prepared the rest of that bag while we were driving.

30 units, cigarette cotton, find a vein, pull for the red flag, then inject.  Now I felt those pins and needles even more from that tiny bag and I started to feel relaxed finally.

It was peaceful, but only for a moment.

‚ÄúThere he is!‚Äù I heard a voice say as my eyes popped open.

I was on the ground in a parking lot.  I looked out and couldn‚Äôt see much, my vision was extremely cloudy, but I saw a bunch of faces and they all looked concerned.  I got up as quickly as I could so I could analyze the situation.  As soon as I popped up I heard that same voice again with a pair of hands on me.

‚ÄúEasy buddy!‚Äù

I was next to the car and saw all my stuff on the roof of it.  I started grabbing it to put back into my pockets without thinking.  I looked around and saw all the faces.  About a dozen pedestrians, EMTs, my dealer, and Cop.  All of which were staring at me in silence while the EMTs were putting shit away.

I overdosed.

My dealer called 911 as he was speeding me to the hospital and dispatch told him to pull over and pull me out of the car to lay me on my back.  He used every bit of strength he had to pull me out of his car and lay me out for the EMTs to arrive.  I don‚Äôt know what he did, I‚Äôm not sure if he gave me sternum rubs, slapped me, or any of that shit.  I‚Äôm not sure how much time went by, but it wasn‚Äôt scary for me.

It was peaceful, and I felt comfortable.  I didn‚Äôt experience anything profound, just absolute relaxation.  I didn‚Äôt see anything, and I didn‚Äôt hear anything.  It was just nothingness.  I didn‚Äôt feel stuck, I just felt calm.  For once in my life I felt calm.  Being afraid of what I experienced is like being scared of a nap when you‚Äôre really tired.

The only reason why I assume I remember any of this is because it was when blood was rushing back to my brain.  I didn‚Äôt hear people talking, I didn‚Äôt hear any sirens, I didn‚Äôt feel anyone touching me, it was just like the deepest most peaceful rest I could have experienced.  As far as I was concerned, that was death.  Did my heart stop?  I don‚Äôt know, but if it didn‚Äôt then it wasn‚Äôt far from it.  It made me not fear the question of what happens after death anymore - it made me accept what comes after life.  Which is nothing.  And I was okay with that.

Your consciousness just ceases to exist.  It‚Äôs not death itself that bothers me, I accepted a long time ago that I was prepared for death, and I didn‚Äôt expect to be alive much longer anyways.  What threw me off was waking up.

‚ÄúAlright Nate, we gotta take you to the hospital.‚Äù the EMT said.

‚ÄúFuck that, dude.  I can‚Äôt afford an ambulance ride!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe revived you.  We have to take you in to get checked out.‚Äù

I relented.  I climbed into the ambulance with all the onlookers and as they were closing the door I could see my dealer white as a ghost with a Cop standing next to him looking pissed.  As the doors shut we began to leave.

‚ÄúSo how did this all start?‚Äù He questioned me sincerely.

I felt empty inside.  I didn‚Äôt care anymore, I would have told him anything at that point.  ‚ÄúI got injured at a job when I was about 20 and got Vicodin.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh yeah.  I‚Äôve heard that a lot.‚Äù

He‚Äôs had to do this before, he‚Äôs seen people in my position before.  Usually when you speak to an EMT there is a level of apathy because they can‚Äôt bring the work home with them.  They can‚Äôt think about the shit they‚Äôve seen or had to do during their daily routine.  But this man had empathy in his voice.  You could tell he‚Äôs dealt with a lot of overdoses, and you could tell he hated to watch people fall down that rabbit hole.  He didn‚Äôt have a mournful tone, but a positive one.  He didn‚Äôt want to give off any feeling of pity, but encouragement and positivity.  A ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs going to be okay‚Äô feeling.

It was a short ride to the hospital, and the whole time I felt awful.  I had a horrible headache which is what I assume is the blood rushing back to my brain, and my vision was extremely foggy.  Like the early stages of a migraine.  I had post nasal drip that was horrid and bitter, but not enough to make me gag.  That was the Narcan.  Something I never wanted to have to experience, but there I was sitting in an ambulance with half my vision, a terrible headache, and an awful taste in the back of my throat.

Getting to the hospital I was in a total daze and could hardly form sentences as if I was drunk and slurring my speech.  It took effort to enunciate words.  The EMTs rolled me to the front desk where I offered my information, and then they rolled me into the hallway.

‚ÄúJust hang out here, man.  Someone will check on you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt really realize what was happening, I figured they were going to do tests on me or a psych evaluation.  A very attractive young doctor came up to me and finally spoke with me.

‚ÄúHey Nate.  I heard you‚Äôve just overdosed.  We‚Äôre going to observe you here for a little bit to make sure you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I thought.  I didn‚Äôt want to be there, I wanted to sink into the earth.  I wanted the moon to fall on me.  I just wanted this all to go away.  But I didn‚Äôt care, and I was still in a daze.  I complied.

As I sat in the hallways of this hospital I just stared at the ceiling tiles, front desk, and yellowing linoleum floor.  I checked my pockets as I don‚Äôt even remember what I grabbed.  I had my wallet, my keys, my phone, cigarettes, and no syringe.  The EMTs disposed of it while I was out which I appreciated.  I dug a little deeper in the pocket of my University of Illinois hoodie.  I felt a bag.

Fuck.  I still had some.  I knew I wanted to throw it out, but I desperately didn‚Äôt want to go through withdrawals.  This shit is the whole reason why I was sitting in the hospital, and I still couldn‚Äôt bring myself to flush it.  I should be dead.  I was supposed to be dead.

After a couple hours that nice doctor came up to me.

‚ÄúHey Nate.  How are you feeling.‚Äù

‚ÄúIm fine.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt have it in me to give anything but short answers.  What difference would it make anyways?  What would I have told her?  That I‚Äôm falling into a pit of existential dread wallowing in my own demise?  She doesn‚Äôt need to hear that shit, she doesn't need to worry about me.  She needs to focus on the people in rooms that are suffering, not some asshole that can‚Äôt make good life decisions.

‚ÄúAre you experiencing any withdrawals or anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, okay.  Good.‚Äù  She seemed surprised, and I didn‚Äôt really understand why considering I just got high a couple hours ago.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to come back and check on you in a bit.‚Äù.

She was sweet, and seemed genuine.  The hospital and patience either hadn‚Äôt broken her yet, or she genuinely cared about the wellbeing of people.

Another hour passed and she showed up again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably pissed and just want to get the hell out, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm pretty fuckin‚Äô done.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter and Overdose we need to keep people for four hours, that way we can make sure they don‚Äôt overdose again as the Narcan wears off.‚Äù

I was upset she was telling me that towards the end of my time there, as no one was telling me what the fuck they were observing.  But if I‚Äôm being honest, if she didn‚Äôt leave me in the dark from the beginning I probably would have said ‚Äòfuck that‚Äô and left.  She understood that I didn‚Äôt want to be there, and she understood I was pissed for sitting in a hallway on a bed for several hours.  She walked away soon after telling me she‚Äôd come back soon though.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt focus on me, spend more time on your patients.‚Äù

She smiled and walked away.  She wasn‚Äôt going to listen to me, she‚Äôd be back soon enough.  It‚Äôs nice to see a non judgemental soul when you‚Äôre in such a vulnerable position.  It offers comfort and a certain calmness to all the chaos.

‚ÄúHey Nate!‚Äù It was that same EMT dropping off another patient.  ‚ÄúYou doing okay, man?  I know this shit sucks, but just stick it out a little bit longer.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for everything, dude.  I have a lot of respect for your work.‚Äù I said with a soft voice.  I didn‚Äôt feel strong, and I didn‚Äôt feel confident.

It meant a lot that he came and gave me a quick two second visit when he saw me.  A total stranger gave a shit about me, but I felt like a lost cause.  It reminded me that there are some people in this world that only want to see their fellow man do better, even if we do live in such a self centered society.

I was about a half hour from being allowed to leave so I needed to figure out a way to get home.  I didn‚Äôt know who the fuck I could contact so that wouldn‚Äôt make me feel like even more of a piece of shit already.  I texted someone I‚Äôd regularly get high with.

‚ÄúHey man.  Can you pick me up at the hospital in the city?  I OD‚Äôd, and I got no one else to call.‚Äù

‚ÄúYah ill be there in 30‚Äù

The doctor came up to me again and handed me a bunch of pamphlets on being safe, proper needle disposal, rehab facilities, etc.  Was I going to read any of that?  Fuck no.  I felt like a lost cause and those just reminded me of how shitty of a person I was.

‚ÄúAlright Nate, it‚Äôs been four hours.  You seem like you‚Äôll be fine so you can leave.  Give these a read, and don‚Äôt be afraid to make some phone calls.‚Äù

I wanted to thank her, but I didn‚Äôt know how.  I was too mad at myself, and I felt too emotionally numb.  I got up and walked out the front entrance of the E.R.

As I lit a cigarette my phone rang.

‚ÄúYo dude.  I‚Äôll be there in 8 minutes.‚Äù

Ah yes, classic.  Give me an oddly specific number to make me think you‚Äôve already been on your way when you‚Äôre actually just leaving now.  I‚Äôm not fucking stupid, but I just don‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúCool man.  Thanks dude.‚Äù

I sat outside chain smoking what left I had of cigarettes just waiting in the chilly april evening.  It was dark out, around 8pm, and all I had on were my work pants and hoodie just staring at the parking garage that I was unfortunately familiar with from visiting people I cared about.

He pulled up and I got in.  I lit another cigarette and he decided to break the silence.

‚ÄúCongratulations.  You‚Äôre officially a junkie.‚Äù He laughed after saying it.

‚ÄúFuck you, man.‚Äù I said softly.  ‚ÄúI feel like shit about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah man, I know.  I felt like hell the first time I OD‚Äôd.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt feel sick, I felt lost.

He drove me back to my place and dropped me off, and at that point I had to act like nothing happened.  I walked upstairs past my roommates and went on the back deck to smoke another cigarette.

‚ÄúHey man, I‚Äôll be there in a few‚Äù

Fuck.  I totally forgot.  Joe was supposed to come over and hang out.  We‚Äôd been friends since we were 13 and I‚Äôm even his daughter‚Äôs godfather.  Normally i‚Äôd feel anxious about him showing up, but this time I just didn‚Äôt care.  When he did show up I poured myself a whiskey and ginger ale and we went to smoke a cigarette outside.

I don‚Äôt remember anything else after that.  I was shell shocked, and I tried my hardest not to show it.  I had essentially expected to be dead by 27, and less than two months before my 27th birthday I overdosed.  I should have died, I expected to die, hell I pretty much planned that it‚Äôd happen from my reckless behavior.  And when it didn‚Äôt I had no clue what to do.  You‚Äôd think this would have made me snap out of it and get help, but I felt more lost.  While before I was certain that my death would happen by that time, it gave me a sense of direction.  A very dark purpose.  However now that I had survived, everything I had planned to happen to me was gone - I had no direction.  I came out from that and felt nothing anymore, just anger towards myself.

All this time I didn‚Äôt care about myself because I was sure I‚Äôd be dead.  I felt nothing anymore.  I had always been a bit hollow, but not like this.  This was new.  I knew I‚Äôd be happy about something, but I didn‚Äôt feel my soul glow.  I knew people loved me, but I couldn‚Äôt feel my heart swell.  I knew I was sad, but I didn‚Äôt feel it in my stomach.  I would express anger towards people so they‚Äôd leave me alone, I wasn‚Äôt worth their time.  But I couldn‚Äôt be so transparent about this because I didn‚Äôt want to catch anyone's attention about my misery even though it was woefully obvious to everyone in my house.

Joe went home, and I poured myself another drink.  I needed to sleep because I had work in the morning.  Rest was imminent, and the only way I was going to sleep was by an extra drink that night.  I was hollow, I was alone, and I had no one.  I was a husk of a person, and I didn‚Äôt care.  I sat on the edge of my bed staring at my rug as I slowly drank just falling into a deep trench of self loathing.  Everything had to appear copasetic.

Was smoking fent for almost 6 months daily(some CT attempts in between). At the end of it I went from a point a day to a nearly a gram a day. I know sleep issues are a major thing coming off opiates and I just really gotta know- if anyone has had a similar short term relationship with fent, when did you finally sleep naturally(or with the help of a heavy indica)??
My doctor prescribed me 7 pills of 7.5mg zopiclone 2 days ago. I split that between myself and my partner who is in the very same boat as me, so now I have none. Zop only keeps me down for a couple hours at best. I think in the last 7 days I‚Äôve slept 8 hours and I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. 
The whole no sleep thing has put me on the thought path where I think ‚Äúwell if I only do a little to sleep..‚Äù.
I know how ‚Äújust one more time‚Äù goes for almost everybody so I don‚Äôt actually WANT to do that and start the process over again. But it does have me wondering what WOULD happen if I did? Would it put me back to day 1 where I‚Äôm shitting and puking and can‚Äôt move?

From one blue 30 a weekend, to 10 blues per day when I jumped. 

I just wanted to provide you guys with an update and some positive reassurance on this beautiful Tuesday. I know what it‚Äôs like to be scared to quit, simply because you don‚Äôt want to go through the withdrawal process, or because you want to time it up with a holiday or an extended amount of time you can have off of work. 

I just want you guys to know you should put your health over any job every time. Your job will replace you the second you fuck something up, your health is much more important. I‚Äôm glad I took the steps I did and took a couple weeks off of work to put myself first. At day 15 I am gradually sleeping more and more EVERY.SINGLE.NIGHT (6 hours last night). My energy is starting to restore as I continue to push my body beyond its current comfort limits. I started working out again, and my first day back to work was more productive than I‚Äôve been in the last couple of years being on those devil pills.

I‚Äôm not overthinking about PAWS coming up in the future or any of that shit. Your mental approach to getting through this has so much to do with your success. We‚Äôre not supposed to feel great everyday as humans, we have good and bad days. So if you have a bad day don‚Äôt jump and contribute that to PAWS, it‚Äôs just a bad day. It‚Äôs actually good because it means you‚Äôre healing. 

I‚Äôm telling you guys if you want to quit, just do it and don‚Äôt wait for the perfect time. I went cold turkey from a 10/day fentanyl blue 30 habit without any subs, kratom, xans, or anything. JUST STRAIGHT OFF THE MUSCLE. End of the day you just have to want this shit. Use the pain as motivation to push hard so you never have to feel this way again.

Physical acutes lasted almost a month. The mental was so bad that I could hardly function. I couldn‚Äôt even drive! Five miserable months clean go by and then I happened upon a bottle of oxy left out in my home. I completely caved after such a hard fight. Justified using and found my way into my moms safe. I now had access to copious amounts of Oxy and still do. My mom doesn‚Äôt use whatsoever and has actually been in recovery for 15 years. She is just into survivalist stuff so she stock piles all kinds of things. Especially medicine. I feel so extremely guilty. The shame has been eating me alive. I want to tell her. I want to tell everyone, but I feel like so afraid. 

So for the last 2 months or so I have been snorting and taking opiates (oxy) like never before. I‚Äôve kept track of my daily use and it‚Äôs around 150mg-200mg a day. Give or take a few. I‚Äôve always flushed them on occasion out of guilt and feeling ready to stop the habit dead in it‚Äôs tracks. I want to get clean! Lord help me. I‚Äôm hurting my family & myself. I can‚Äôt keep disappointing them. I hate myself for this. I want to be free. I feel like a prisoner but, I‚Äôm so traumatized from my sub withdrawal and have been avoiding the inevitable. So in total I have been using some form of opiate for like a year, maybe a little more. With 5 months clean prior to this 2ish month Oxy relapse. A couple of questions. Would you all consider my use heavy? Will withdrawal be bad after 2 months use?
I have a couple of 8mg subs. Has anyone had success tapering small amounts of subs to get off opiates? If so how? Should I avoid subs and tough it out? ALSO can tapering the Oxy help?
I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone with experience! Or just life saving advice in general! I need help. I start my detox tomorrow as I can no longer continue taking the Oxy. There is hardly any left. I know I will soon have to admit the truth. I just want to be clean when I do it.

You always have those people in the world of substance abuse who enjoy the chaos and have no desire to fit into society. On the other hand, you have people who are so desperate to do just that, fit into society and leave the underworld behind. I‚Äôm one of those people. When I was running around on dope, the worst part of it was having to deal with fellow users, dealers, and everyone in the underworld of the illicit drug trade.  
 

I hated it. I hated the lack of structure and lack of reliability. I hated the fact that if I ordered sheets on Amazon, they would arrive at my house from 3000 miles away EXACTLY when they were supposed to--but when I ordered the drug that I NEEDED to feel better, my dealer would say to me ""I'm three or four minutes away"" and then one hour later still wouldn't be there. They would stop answering their phone while I would wait desperately for a call back. After two hours of waiting for ""three or four minutes"" to come, I would get a call from them.... ""Hey, I‚Äôll be there in ten minutes"" 45 minutes later, they'd finally show up.  
 

I absolutely DETESTED this nonsense. Another enraging aspect of the underworld was that my dealers would frequently use the expression ""I'm pulling up"" The meaning is supposed to be that they are seconds away. That is literally what ""pulling up"" means. But unfortunately, somewhere down the line, the meaning changed, and I didn't get the memo. Because in the underworld of users and dealers, ""pulling up"" means anything from ""20 minutes away"" to ""I'm going to leave my house sometime today and then START to drive to you but will likely be distracted by something along the way because I have the attention span of a goldfish. In fact, it is highly likely that as soon as I hang up from this call, I will forget about everything we just discussed""  
 

I hated it so much that it enrages me to even talk about it, even though all this time has passed. 

I remember I was in a new area and I had a neighbor who helped me find a something. He told me he could get it, but not until he got back home. He said that he would be home by noon. He did not get there until 11PM. He was vague as ever, even though I wanted details. TRUE details. Details like ""When will you be here?"" ""Do you have it does someone else have it?"" ""What's the quality of the stuff?"" ""If we're getting it elsewhere, have you confirmed that this person even has it or is this someone you THINK has it?""  
 

But nope. He simply said, ""I'll be there and then we'll take care of it""  
 

So after being 11 hours late I said, ‚ÄúDo you have it?"" To which he replied, ""No, but I know someone who does."" 

‚Ä¶  
 

I had my head in my hands at this point.

I asked him, begrudgingly, ""Have you called him?"" He answers ""Nah, but I will when I pull up‚Äù  
 ....  
 ....  
 ‚Ä¶.

  
 He had ALL DAY to call him. By the way, this was not a small purchase. I gave this person a large financial incentive to make this happen for me, and he still behaved like this. 

After a while of running around on dope, I learned that there is no amount of money you can pay these dealers to be efficient. It is like a foreign language to them. They literally do not know how.

Anyway, after being 11 hours late, he picks me up and we drive 30 minutes away, wait 20 minutes for his contact to pull up and guess what?

 He shorted the bag. And not just by a little bit. I got less than half of what I was supposed to get. And what I did get was mixed with sugar.

Another undependable aspect of using street opioids is that one could buy a bag of stuff that is so weak that they are barely getting anything.  
 

But the next day, that same person can buy a bag that‚Äôs a little more potent and proceeds to kill them.  
 

When I was messing around on dope, I noticed that for some reason, within the community, people didn‚Äôt mind taking huge risks, didn‚Äôt do ANY due diligence at all, didn‚Äôt plan anything, and then when things went horribly wrong, they would scratch their head and wonder why. 

I have always been a planner who makes sure all details are straight. And being that kind of person has earned me accusations of being a cop within the drug using community. To me, that is insane: That If I am not a disorganized braindead mess, they think it is characteristic of a cop.

So, you know what? I gave that all up, got on Methadone, and I never looked back. My clinic is always reliable. They have never failed me once. They are always there, like clockwork, from 5:30AM to 10AM. I do not ever show up to the clinic to try the door to find out that it is locked. I do not ever have to text the nurse saying, ‚ÄúHey, where you at?‚Äù and then receive a reply from them saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pulling up‚Äù And then wait hours for them while they still have not shown up. Never has that happened one time. And that is why I chose them. I chose peace of mind over chaos. I don‚Äôt get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù anymore, but it does what it‚Äôs supposed to, and I don‚Äôt get any cravings. And best of all, I have my life back. Unlike before, I can think logically and objectively, and when I am making my decisions based on logic, there is no way that I‚Äôm ever going to rely on drug dealers ever again.

(Question from a recurrent addict who should know anyways)," I relapsed last May after a break-up and then after two weeks was like ""fuck this I can't do this shit again"" and I switched to kratom. Which is a lifesaver and I'd never have quit H the first time without it (and subs) but idk, I actually find it pretty damn addictive now, very hard to quit, partially *because* it isn't super hardcore. I've been averaging like 40g a week since.

Anyways, around Christmas I was alone and I used it as an excuse to get H. I bought some, used it all, then decided to stop and suck it up and live through withdrawal. I did, and then I stayed without dope or kratom for like three weeks.

Then, because I suck, work got in the way and I started using kratom again. And I got a gram of H last week which I'm about to finish soon. Haven't used any kratom since I started this gram. (I only plug/snort, never have IV'd).

This is going to sound like the most junkie rationalizing shit ever but, I'm considering taking advantage of my H relapse as an excuse to jump off kratom. Hey, for some fucking reason, it worked in December until I decided to be a dumbass. And I'm extremely curious why that is. Obviously, the withdrawal is worse but maybe something about it being so in your face makes it less terrifying to take on? Is it that it's shorter? I'd really like to understand a little bit better. If it's shorter, that could be a good reason to force myself off this shit now. If it's not, still will try to take advantage, and it'd be insightful to know so I can better understand my addiction. (I find weed very psychologically addicting even though it's obviously no dope. Perhaps I find kratom to be similarly psychologically addictive).

Tried going to a doctor to try to get clonidine since the research shows it could speed up the process, and he won't support it (supports me getting off, but not cold turkey UGH). Ive been clean the whole time, get 13 take homes etc etc. I have no desire to take opiates, (was a pill user) but they are saying they won't support it because the risk of me relapsing (not gunna happen, shits too expensive now. When I was doing my oxy and norco, it was $6-$12 per oxy and like $1-$2 for norco.), or apparently me choking on my vomit? (Ive never EVER got the runs or vomiting while withdrawling...lol knock on wood now I guess)  I dont understand why they won't support my detox. They just made me an app for their in house sub clinic and im like wtaf you know I'm on methadone. Im still going to have to withdraw to get on subs anyways and this doesn't change anything! 

I'm still going to kick against his orders, but if I fail im def not going back to that shit clinic. Fuck. That. 

Just feel really defeated rn. Fucking sucks. I really thought this doctor who always was super supportive of me quitting would get it. We had an over the phone app and he was 100% on board so I went for an in-person app to talk into it more and got handed an appointment card for the sub clinic and its just ugggggh. I was super excited for the idea that maybe. JUST MAYBE I could take something to make my detox go faster so my kids can come back from their dads and I can get on with my life. Iv detoxed at way higher lvls before. It sucked, but I had to quit the detox at the tail end because of a physically abusive relationship.

2021-04-05 11:32:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mkneqi/odd_ct_withdrawals_for_me/,Odd CT Withdrawals (for me),"Hey guys, hope you are doing well today. I figured I'd stop in here because it's been a rough 11 days, and you guys might have some insight on what I'm going through.

I struggled with opiates in the past, starting on oxycontin (100mg or so a day) and CTd that back in 2009. Got back on hydros (30-40mg a day) in 2015 and stayed on them and CTd in 2019 (june). 

in November 2019 I relapsed once again on hydros (30-40mg a day), and that continued until 1.5 months ago when i got a script of little orange oxycodone 10s (of which I did 30-40mg a day). 

I tried to transition to suboxone in early March because I really was not liking the high I was getting from the oxycodone and I decided I wanted to quit, so I used zubsolv (maybe a mg worth of bup a day) for a week and my last dose was on March 23rd.

Around March 25th/26th I noticed I was in full on wtf mode and I was hit by a suddent strong depression and anxiety that didn't show any signs of stopping until the 2nd of april. I think I got what they call the ""Pink Cloud"" because I've dipped back into a low as of Saturday night, and Sunday was worse, but nothing near as bad as March 25th/26th area.

In all my withdrawals before, I've never had the sheer nightmare of psychological symptoms that I've had recently. At first I convinced myself that it was something else and not withdrawal, or maybe withdrawal exacerbated it, but god that made me feel so much worse. 

I have had 0, actually below 0 cravings for any opiates this whole time... which is super damn odd. It makes me sick to think about doing them actually, which I know is a good thing, but just... yeah, odd.

Lastly, the only real lasting physical symptoms I've had besides a slight bout with diarrhea, is elevated blood pressure. Mostly my systolic number but sometimes my diastolic shoots up too. I can correlate my anxiety (or worsening of it) to the blood pressure. I've been trying to eat better, and clonidine definitely helps but I gotta take a real small amt of it or my BP drops too low.

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant guys - if this makes sense to you guys, or you think my trending uphill climb will continue, please feel free to reinforce my positive thinking <3",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66130275}"

I embarrassed him by accident PWs in front of my family but they only want us to be the best we can be. I'm done

This is my 3rd go around. Except this time I accidentally brought the love of my life with me. He had never messed with H before, only narcos and oxy, and me being the seasoned vet should have never suggested switching but I did about 2 years ago and I brought him down with me. I'm very lucky he doesn't see it that way and wants to get off of it together. As much as I say that I would leave him if he didn't want to get better (which I will do), I am forever grateful I have someone to do this with and I really don't know what I would do if I were on my own.

This weekend I swore to him that we would be able to take Suboxone so we could go visit my family. Read some where you could take them 12 hours after fentanyl but I accidentally put us into PWs pretty fucking intensely. So bad my Mom was feeding us her narcos so we could be even just normal for the rest of the day. And that barely scratched the surface. It was literally the most embarrassing thing.

I just decided to be honest with my family. Like I said this ain't my first rodeo but no one has seen me this low. Told them I had regained substance abuse problems and we were withdrawing.. I have never felt more supported in my life. My husband hasn't had a support system (other than myself) for a long time and the way my family wants to prop us both up for success is just.... Amazing and overwhelming. I am beyond grateful and fully recognize that I am more than lucky to have them because some people just don't.

So we agreed that we're done with it. I have absolutely zero desire to touch that shit again. I have more important things to spend my money on and think about. I read the detoxing mega thread but if anyone else has anything to add please feel free.

This is my first time not going to a rehab center to detox so fingers crossed. We're about to hit 24 full hours. I feel like shit but I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel (:

It was yet another prolonged moment of silence staring at the concrete wall. Her house was reduced to simply a set of walls that encapsulated her dying emotions and incredible numbness. Each hour that went by was signified by the bonging of the grandfather clock; this was a family heirloom that only now reminded her of an hour of dulling life evaporating. This hour was particularly painful. It was the fifty second hour of her detox. At around the 24-48 hour mark, the withdrawals become the most severe and Beata surely was feeling them. There were lots of conversations going on in her head, however all were really that different from each other and none of which she was an active participant. Her mind seemed to be occupied by thoughts that weren‚Äôt hers. She was consumed by desires she felt she needed, but knew that she did not want to act on them. The next 24 hours would prove to be the hardest couple dozen of her life and there was nothing to motivate her to continue other than the pain itself. 

When she would ask herself if she wanted to break her cycle of addiction and continue to endure this pain, it felt obvious to her the answer but the wrong answer felt the most right. She knew that if she took the powder and put it into her pipe she would be instantly relieved of all that ails her and that she would be ready to try again next week. Of course next week would never come as this was her last attempt at life. 

This was the first two days that she had been sober in years. She was inspired by her boyfriend to get clean, as he had just taken his own life through an overdose just days prior. Devastated, that same night of his death she tried to take too much but not before her room mate caught her passed out on the kitchen floor without any new breaths being taken. Beata was embarrassed, but more-so heartbroken that she woke up again and this time in the hospital. If she used again, she knew that she would rather take too much than to wake up the next day, and surely she would be successful at it. This was her last fighting chance, and if she were to give up on her sobriety she would be giving up on her life.

She was drenched by sweat, clouded with depression, and teased by the thought of happiness one day. All she knew was that there was a a blank white wall in front of her that kept her goals present in her mind. Despite it not being a mirror, looking at nothing always caused her to reflect on her life and helped her mind stay vacant, rather than to overflow with hatred.

My question is, people who have quit and aren‚Äôt on any replacement therapy, in your opinion do you have to be 100% DONE and not even a tiny part of you wants to use anymore? Or did you quit with some doubts and part of you still missing using, and you managed to get clean and stay clean?

What did you find important for your recovery? 

I live in Germany and plan on doing my aftercare here because through our free insurance I can get a maximum of 6 months rehab.. The thing is that they are pretty conventional and rather than helping your healing, they focus on making you a functioning worker. Now I'm already functioning and working but addicted..
Maybe you have keywords for what to look for in a rehab facility? I found great private places also in Mexico that use psychedelics, art, yoga, meditation, gardening, psychotherapy, healthy food, classes.. but they cost like 12k dollars for six weeks.

I know that is affecting me but nevertheless I am frustrated.

I am officially 10 months clean this month. I have been doing better and I even stopped drinking and only smoke a small amount of cannabis that is followed by my doctor. After all this time I am happier I suppose but I am finding that lately I am wanting.to sleep all the time and I basically just watch Netflix all day in between taking naps.

I might be sober but I am not happy the way I wanted and often wonder why I don't just start drinking again for example. But I have reached a point where alcohol literally does not interest me at all.

I don't know how to get better at this point. I take all my prescribed meds. I do virtual NA 3 times a week. I attend a mental health support group in my town virtually every Monday. So I have support and I also have an addiction counselor and we talk every 2 weeks. I just hating feeling tired all the time, no energy or interest in anything, and feel as though anything but laying around watching tv is too much work.

Is this just a normal part if recovering? To slip back into sadness/depression from time to time? Or is it just being burnt out from this pandemic shit keeping me even more isolated? I feel like I know that this will pass and I will feel better but it's so difficult feeling thinway. Doing well for months and then falling back into a depression period.

I'm also thinking of talking to my doctor about sleep apnea which I think I have. I snore like crazy throughout the night and clearly don't get quality sleep.

I'm a 34 year old male who kicked oxys three years ago. At that time I was doing 60-80mg a day. I was sick of the anxiety I was getting from having to find dope to make sure I wouldn't feel like shit and ended up getting myself into a Suboxone program. The program worked in the sense that it allowed me to break free of the oxys but to my detriment it shut down my ability to produce testosterone. It caused some unwanted side effects with the worst of it being that I became very emotional and messed with my sex life as I was unable to sustain erections. I ended up getting on testosterone replacement therapy which helped a bit but ended up making my blood too thick and was a burden on my cardiovascular system so had to stop taking it. This helped me make the decision to get off the subs as quickly as my doctor recommended which was pretty much 1 year from when I started taking subs. It wasn't easy but I broke free from all opiates in February 2019 and was doing well for 2 years. Of course I missed the feeling but I was able to tell myself it wasn't worth it that is untill about a month ago. You see I've been dealing with abdominal pain in the liver and spleen area since last summer. The pain isn't debilitating but its constantly there alternating between a gnawing and burning. It has made me very irritable and anxious as the docs can't figure out what it is. Anyhow as you can imagine I used the pain to justify a reason to get some pills just to see if it's help with the pain. Well it did help and I also got reacquainted with that high feeling. It was great. I started taking 10-20 mg a day. Here we are a month later and I'm up to 40-50mg a day. I'm so pissed off at myself for allowing this to happen again. I don't know if others have experienced a blunting of your cognitive functions but it definitely has for me. Most noticeably Im constantly blanking on words. On top of that I'm super irritable and there are times where I feel like I've taken too much and am scared for my life. I've even written a couple notes to my loved ones in case I don't wake back up explaining how I love them and am sorry for getting myself back into this situation. I guess I'm looking for some words of encouragement/wisdom from the community. I really don't want to go back on subs but will if I have to. Does anyone think with it only being a month of me using again that I could kick it easier than when I had used for almost two years? Tbh I haven't even tried. I wake up in the morning and it's the first thing I do as my body is already feeling some of the withdrawal. Maybe I should just start with that? Try and see how long I can make it without using. I'm sorry I'm probably rambling but I have no one to talk to about this. I'm super ashamed of myself and just needed to get some of this out.,2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.612479}"

Like I could somehow just stop when I wanted too. I didn't need help or talk about it. Id just stop. And I'd suddenly be happy and able to. Even though I got in this mess for a reason. Well that day came. The day I just had to 'stop'. My family and partner were behind me. And 2 months later I relapsed straight back into lying to get high. Granted it was only one day a week - the rest of it i was on subs as im on MAT as well. Both my mum and partner are addicts so it wasn't so much the relapse that hurt them. It was the lying. I got caught out this weekend and im sure everyone here will know the utter disappointment yet a huge wash of strange relief felt when you're caught out. When the jig is up. The lies exposed. When you've got no choice but to face the demon staring back at you daily. 

My biggest issue is rationalising everything. I can rationalise anything away. And then separate myself from the lies because of x or y reason. But not this time. I am going to stay alert. I am going to stay focused. I am going to realise I've stayed on this earth for some reason and because I made that choice I cannot and will not keep hurting the ones I love. 

I have a big life change coming up. I'm going to be responsible for another human and I will never ever inflict my suffering on him. I've already failed him and I have to own that. I have to hear those words instead of rationalising away why I may not have.

I've been through it over the last 8-10 years or so, on and off constantly. Only ""lighter"" opioids such as codeine and tramadol, but in huge doses, coupled with valium. 

I recently started abusing Pregablin (Lyrica) too, and did a 600mg dose with some liquor and had a seizure in front of my wife, and was taken to hospital where I had a second seizure. 

It's obviously been pretty troubling, I bit off half my tounge (It's healed now).

In the past I've made it to almost 300 days clean and remember feeling fantastic. Currently I'm on day 16 clean (Since the seizure) from opioids, and day 5 from benzos (I was previously a few weeks clean, then got a box of 5mg diazepam post-seizure to help cope with sleep and opioid WD, which I'm now 5 days clean from - it really helped) and I'm just feeling **so god damn depressed.** The initial physical WD seems to be over, but this feeling of emptiness and depression is just so much to deal with. I'm also studying social work which isn't exactly steering me away from depressive topics!

I just wanted to get that off my chest and hear how long it took you to feel a little more human again. Obviously my brain chemistry is running a muck and I don't expect to feel good for a bit, but would love to hear some words of encouragement or personal stories. 

Thanks guys, and good luck to you all.

Everyday I have random memories from my past just flow through my head and I tell myself and then actually have what I call a post acute withdrawal anxiety syndrome BUT DARN- it never ends-I can't stop it-everyday it gets the best of me-I can't focus-even just sitting here thinking about the past 90 days- I was totaled and hopeless and truly felt polarized and isolated down into my bones and soul when I got out of detox 91 days ago and it drove me back to meetings but I know in my heart and soul I am not going to meetings to stay clean, I'm going to be around people BUT JEEZ!!! I was feeling,almost consumed with more PAWS anxiety and discomfort in the meetings 2days ago-I'm taking a break, maybe a week, and do my 2hr workout and saunas-which I haven't been doing in over a week--Yes, Yes! It's all in my head! No, No! It's in all of me! I'm always gonna be and feel alone and crazy polarized in my soul. I can't work until I get my mental bipolar disability check which is gonna be months and everyday I'm sure I'm gonna have a mental breakdown before the check comes because it seems I'm certain everyday will be the same crazy-I live my whole fucking life over everyday. Time ticks by. I feed into nonstop angst type thinking. I think I'm alone. I am alone. I think I will always be alone. I was on godawful long heroin binges on the street because heroin made me feel anything but alone( powerful, content) Then I would have serious PAWS again and again and then go back out. Over 20yrs of Heroin use. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! I'm still trapped in hell now and I can still see summers or winters of years past and they start lighting on fire in my mind's eye-running, crazy, up and down the street, going to The Bluff, practically living in The Hole in The Bluff, people laughing, people dying, hardcore junkies, Whatever! I swear to ZOD! I don't give a f@#k about all that now but get a load of this! When will my NOW get better? I am going to go the gym in a minute but JEEZ now I can start remembering like having these crystal clear memories of almost having a dementia because I was having nonstop crazy narratives in my head and I would feel strange and uncomfortable and I would be looking at someone I didn't know too long and they would look back---I know it's gonna take Time. I definitely was on Heroin and booze for too long. I almost think or feel that I am psychologically screwed up permanently most everyday. I actually think I have a weird social anxiety but I actually know how to fight through it----ANYHOW----I know I am free from Heroin---It certainly takes a while to get your mind right after doing that godawful stuff.

But we all know how that story goes. Once a weekend turns to using for a whole weekend, turns to add a day during the week, before you know it it‚Äôs every day. 

Let‚Äôs be real, real 30s cost twice what the pressies do and once you take a pressie you ain‚Äôt even trying to talk about anything you gone get from a pharmacy. Anyway, that once a weekend habit turned into 10 pressies a day. Granted I worked my way up there with time, but I was at that high of a dose for a couple months before jumping. 

You guys know how much that shit costs, do the math on that shit. I‚Äôm fortunate enough that in this process I didn‚Äôt lose everything (it got close), my house, my car, my wife/5 year old son, etc. How may you ask??? Well fortunately I have a good job, but also because I didn‚Äôt keep my problems to myself. I recognized there was an issue and told my wife, and my parents to get some help. PLEASE DO NOT BE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT THIS, we‚Äôre in an opioid epidemic right now. You will be shocked to learn how many others may have been in your shoes and you never knew. Anyway....

So it was what it was, I just quit. Cold turkey. Ain‚Äôt have no gaba, xans, kratom, weed, none of that shit. JUST STRAIGHT OFF THE MUSCLE! Day 6 I went ahead and bought 3 xan bars from a friend (who has a script, because in the streets those have fetty too now), just for the sleep. Got my sleep back and that‚Äôs all she wrote. Won‚Äôt take any more xans now, but I do now smoke weed everyday. I‚Äôve smoked weed since I was like 13, I just didn‚Äôt want any crutch during those first grueling 1-5 days. I wanted to feel all that pain and remember how fucking dumb I was for putting myself in that position. This withdrawal shit has so much to do with your mental approach to it. It sucks for sure. But you cannot allow yourself to be scared of it, that will only push you further away from actually making the jump. For any of you wanting to quit, do it TODAY! Not tomorrow, not next week, TODAY! 

I share this to tell you that it is possible. Fuck that fetty and fuck the people around you that think that using that shit is normal. It‚Äôs not. None of us as kids grew up and said hey I want to be a fucking junky when I grow up, so just check yourself. Mind over matter, man the fuck up and I PROMISE YOU you will get through this. Just straight off the muscle, you gotta tell yourself you‚Äôre built different, and you will not allow yourself to be a statistic. 

Trust me I get it, I know the battle isn‚Äôt over. There‚Äôs PAWS and all that other shit you guys worry about and get your brains wrapped around. But for me, it‚Äôs over at 10 days. I ain‚Äôt thinking about no PAWS. I‚Äôm just not OVERTHINKING the situation. Literally cut off anyone who had to do with that shit. I‚Äôm now spending time with my family, playing with my son, working harder and becoming better EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

I pray for y‚Äôall on here seriously. I know the shit is scary when you think of quitting, but I promise you you‚Äôll get through the shit. Come day 6, it feels like you‚Äôre reborn. Music helps too! Literally just 5-6 days of feeling like shit to get your life back!!

Wanted to get back into something recovery related, feel as though this is a good time, as I am unemployed due to a car accident, haven't relapsed but I am back on subs for the pain.

One thing I'm starting to realize is that after heavy use of any opiate, it's almost pointless to go back to complete sobriety, as wonderful as it feels to prove to yourself and everyone around you, some of the damage (not an expert, don't quote me on this, only from experience) is almost irreversible, that being said, I have done alternative methods (ayuashca, peyote, kratom, Ibogaine, all and any non narcotic detox meds you can get from your family doc), the fact still remains the same.  We are in the age of Toxicity. Meaning, when your off your desired choice of opiate, not only is your body withstanding and fighting chemical pollution on the daily, your also dealing with the stress of not having something that at one point, created, that aha moment, or at least a moment of contentment.

&#x200B;

I'm planing on creating a public or private forum, for those specifically struggling with opiate use, as that is my only expertise (a little background with benzos, close to zero to no experience with alcohol, ect ect)

&#x200B;

Anyways this is going to have to work for now, if I can sense a following, of eager likeminded, intellectuals, with a strong will, and perhaps a desire to look at life differently, I may consider sharing the thousands of dollars spent, through insurance, and off insurance, of information, that you could never find in a million years.  Unless you were as fortunate as I to half spent more of a decade of your life in institutions, ect.

Anonymity here is key, but the first thing I want to say before getting carried away, is if you've made it as for as switching from full agonist, to partial (suboxone being partial), I want to explain to you why it might be a good idea to just stay on it, and not get off it.

Unless you are planning on moving to a secluded island, with all amenities provided, bedding food, clothes shelter everything else, maids, cars, everything provided, you are gonna have some trudging to do , while recovering from being blasted on the moon, and that feeling I promise you of always wanting to be high with dissipate, as long as you take what I say at least with a grain of salt at a time, if not more, I promise you, I will be able to at least alleviate a lot of if not almost all of your questions about short term sobriety, long term sobriety ( this pertaining to be people stuck in their jobs, unable to leave for treatment, and people with a lack of income to do basically anything, this goes primarily for you, as far as people with an unlimited supply of money, which some addicts fortunately or unfortunately have a connection too, well you can read this and take what you want from it , but those type of people are unfortunately the most difficult to recover because having a plug to money to that isn't earned by yourself, well that's a whole other issue in of it self ANYONE IS WELCOMED TO READING THIS OF COURSE, SKIN COLOR RACE OPINIONS ON RELIGION AND POLITICS, DOESN'T MATTER, JUST MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, AND IF YOU WANT TO RANT, RANT, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS QUESTION, IF YOUR A HERMIT RECLUSE LIKE MYSELF AND YOU READ 99 PERCENT OF THE THINGS ON REDDIT AND DON'T POST ANYTHING YOUR WELCOME TO READING THIS TOO).

&#x200B;

ANYWAYS MY FIRST POINT BEING STAY ON SUBOXONE IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THAT FAR, IF YOUR ON SUBUTEX, YOUR BASICALLY STILL ON OPIATES. SORRY.  IT'S A STEP UP FROM LIVING A SHADY LIFESTYLE, BUT CHEMICALLY YOUR NOT DOING YOUR BRAIN A FAVOR, IF YOU WANT TO STEP OUT OF THE NODDING OUT CLUB. (most addicts already knowing this, but if you didn't know now you know) there's something special about suboxone and that subutex does not do.  But in order to keep y'all interested I'm not going to give everything out at this moment,  slow and steady wins the race.

So if anyone is curious as to why I'm basically stating complete sobriety, is sort of a waste of time, ask away, and if you have differing opinions, please state them, I cannot say I will be that interested in your response but maybe I might have a change in mind.  The point of this post, is not about complete abstinence, I fortunately avoided the whole fentanyl scene, and I know from hearing about it, I wouldn't be here today if I had gotten my hands on a good amount of it.  So if your reading this, or are alive and breathing today, it is a miracle, I know how horrifying this addiction can become, especially doing it alone, and not feeling like there is the remotest chance of making it in this lifetime, I assure you, fentanyl attacks the brain the same way all the other opiates do, I've cold turkied off a high dose methadone maintenance, so although fent might be a little different, I can't imagine my withdrawals not qualifying me to not understand the level of pain, and torture, opiates become once when you realized you've kind of becomed trapped.

&#x200B;

My goal is to show you maybe in a more fun exciting digestable way, how I went from heavy  narcotic use, to basically close to nothing, with no temptations, no thinking about it, little to zero anxiety, on a 24.7 basis. What foods are started to digest, what tv shows i started to watch, what life style choices I made,  what parts of A.A helped me what parts of A.A and N.A. did not help, certain treatment centers I can probably reccomend, certain detox centers i can reccomend, if you have decent insurance, and the list goes on and on.

But here is my first step, in giving back to the community, long long time ago in a galaxy far far away (not really) more like a computer far far away, I logged in made an account, desperately shared and dumped my story into this subreddit, and although it didn't happen immediately, but close to it, somebody gave me the answer I had been looking for.  At least a step in the right direction, that I would have never been inclined to follow doing (some advice from a fellow recovering addict) and because I decided to take a leap in faith, I'd like to think in some way shape or form, reddit, and some of it's users which still remain unknown to me by complete identity, saved me from razors edge.
