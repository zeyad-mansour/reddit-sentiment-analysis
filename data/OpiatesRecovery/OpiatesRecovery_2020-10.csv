Need encouragement,"I’m on day 8 of sobriety Cold Turkey after 2 years of abusing oxy daily. I went through hell for 4 days,the withdrawals were so terrible and when the withdrawals stopped it was a feeling of euphoria that even drugs couldn’t give but the pink cloud has passed when I was going through the withdrawals I kinda hated when people said the “physical part isn’t the hardest part” because what can be worth than being dopesick but they’re right once the sickness fades off it’s almost like my my body wants to forget the agony that I we just went through and I can grab a couple 30s to celebrate. I am pushing myself and trying to get more hobbies to make myself busy (currently unemployed).Through it all I will force myself to stay clean by reminding myself the agony I went through!

I was prescribed Oxys until I could have surgery (8 days). I’ve used opiates several times in the past but only felt physically dependent on them twice (once for  previous surgery and once from recreational abuse). The morning of the surgery I did not take any opiates (I typically didn’t take any oxys in the morning to keep a clear head). However that morning I got sick with vomiting and hot/cold flashes and was familiar with the symptoms, during the surgery I was given a few doses of fentanyl. After the surgery I was given zofran for nausea and tramadol for pain. I decided to do a quick taper with kratom. I started to experience nausea every morning with vomiting that eventually lead to me vomiting blood. I went to the ER and the doctor believed it was a side effect from combination withdrawal (alcohol/nicotine/etc) and switched me to promethazine which helps marginally better. How can I not wake up every morning hugging my porcelain amigo
TL;DR what helps with nausea and hot flashes from opiate withdrawal/ how long does this last? It’s been a week and I’m still sick as shit",2

I've been chipping for a few years now, more like 15 really. Doing sporadically at first, then once a week, then this year because of lockdown doing it twice a week (two days in a row at weekends), then very recently finding reasons to do it midweek. This has me worried so I'm taking action now. My tolerance has gone way up during this time too, it now takes about 300mg codeine / 150mg DHC to get a buzz. 

My main reason for taking them is boredom. I can't go out at weekends, plus I'm not massively keen on alcohol unless I team it with Pregabalin. With this boredom factor in mind, I was thinking of replacing opiates with LSD (half a trip on a Saturday day, say) and ketamine for those itchy uncomfy nights during the week. I've not done LSD in a while but I do take ketamine every couple of weeks or so when I'm feeling low and it usually sorts things out, in a weird wonky way. 

What other drugs would be useful to slot into this routine? Nothing with addiction risks or neurotoxicity though. I find ketamine pretty safe and I never get the urge to redose, same with LSD. I'd love to include weed but it makes me really paranoid, annoyingly. 

Any thoughts or ideas?",2

I'm thinking I still need to raise or stabilize my T dose, as I sort of feel worse than I did when I just started T, as in I haven't plateaued and instead feel worse much of the time, low energy, etc. 

I'm wondering if I should wait to begin a methadone taper until I have stabilized my T dose, or if I should start to taper sooner and the reduced quantity of opiates in my system should help my low-t symptoms and maybe help me bounce back so to say. My goal is to be off methadone for a couple years and then assess my hormone levels and see if my endogenous T comes back.

I can say now that it's coming up to 5am, I've been working at pretty good efficiency for most of the shift, better than when I was high or sick. I've had two doses of around 2g Kratom to help me through and that is it. Pretty chuffed :).",17

I’ll get these lil 5 day stents where I quit then ether stress or something causes me to start using again.

My mom has been helping me financially a lot this year cause of covid but really was just paying for my habit when work was closed an or work has one of those bad weeks where I don’t make any money. I talked to her today an she kinda gave me the I need to get my shit together speech. She’s already 61 so only had less then 10 years before she retires. I need to quit this destructive habit an move on in life. This is the thing that is holding me back from living the life I want the life I need. I don’t even really have any issues for why I’m using I just wanted to get fucked up and now lately I can’t even get a nod unless I snort like a whole gram line. One thing I will say I’m proud about is that I don’t use neeedles never have never will. I use almost a gram a day. I just need some one to talk to I hold in this whole part of my life kno one knows that I use or have been using. I just want to quit I have about 575mg of methadone I think I just need like 10 days off from work an need to apply myself to quitting cause I feel like I need to do it now. Or wait till the new year after work slows down. Anyone have an recipes for me that I could follow. I just need a way out maybe I’ll tell my job I have covid to get a 10 day window an just detox delete my peoples numbers from my phone an move on. I’ve also been taking CBD a lot it helps a lot but still think I need some kratom or something I don’t kno I’m just tired of all this.

Today at 48 hours of complete misery I bought a bag so I could make the 2 hour drive to pick up some subs. I did all of it at once to get well enough to make the 4+ hour round trip so I would not draw it out. I know I was only sober for 48 hours but is that pretty much back to day 1? I was in such bad shape there was no way for me to make a drive like that without throwing up and shitting on myself(sorry but those who know, know). Last time I waited 96 hours to dose sub  to prevent precipitation wd. 

Also, this is from a stupid relapse. I was clean and completely sober as of July 10 and relapsed end of August so this run has been about two months. Just wanting opinions. I'm not sick right now but I don't feel great. Was the one line I snorted to go get the subs a complete setback to day 1? Just checking any opinions. Thanks in advance for any feedback. Hope everyone's doing well. And I'm really really trying hard. No comfort meds at all is very difficult. All I have is kratom which my habit won't touch for at least a week. Subs are the median and now I have a few. Last time I went from fent to subs in 4 days and then painless switch to kratom in another 4. I always have had success taking much less sub than most. Start with 4 then straight to 2 then 1 then .5. in my experience I've always been able to go straight to kratom while on a low sub dose without a single symptom.  thanks!",1
2020-10-28 14:54:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/jjtw32/starting_norco_taper_today/,Starting Norco taper today,"Hi all. I am brand new here and to Reddit as a whole. Bear with me for the long first post. I am seeking encouragement, guidance and feedback please. 
I have been addicted to prescription pain pills for a long time. I have been prescribed 7 tabs of 10mg of norco daily for the past few years. Before that, I’ve had smaller regular prescriptions, as well as I used to buy them from a friend. I would say I’ve had an addiction for probably 15 years, though it was manageable the first several years where I could go days or weeks without. I have wanted to stop for a while but could never work up to weaning down. Well, my pain management doc told me last month that he is going part time to do procedures only and has to refer all of his chronic pain / daily med patients out to other docs. He said he would prescribe me 3 months worth of meds to get me through until I find a new MD. I’m not going to do that. I have decided to taper down and quit. That was a month ago I last saw my doc. I picked up my 2nd to last rx yesterday. I get 210 10mg norco a month. Since I’ll have one more month’s rx next month, I’ll have a 410 tabs, plus 60 I have put away as a safety net. So I will have a total of 460 tabs to taper down with. 
Starting today, I’m cutting to 6 tabs a day. 
I plan to taper as follows: 

6 tabs daily x 2 weeks
5.5 tabs daily x 1 week
5 tabs daily x 2 weeks
4.5 tabs daily x 1 week
4 tabs daily x 2 weeks
3.5 tabs daily x 1 week
3 tabs daily x 2 weeks
2.5 tabs daily x 2 weeks
2 tabs daily x 2 weeks
1.5 tabs daily x 2 weeks
1 tabs daily x 2 weeks + 4 days
.5 tabs daily x 3 weeks or until they are gone.

The taper process should take me about 22 weeks. Very slow taper to hopefully keep withdrawal symptoms to a minimum. 

I have to do this. I’m tired of being chained to pills. NO ONE in my life knows I take pills. Not even my husband. He knows I see a doc monthly, but he doesn’t know I get pain meds I take daily. So, I’ll be doing this 100% on my own and that’s why I’m here. I know I’ll need the advice and encouragement to help me get through this. I have lived such a double life with my addiction, I will be recovering in silence as well. 
I am open to advice and tips and personal experience feedback on slow tapers. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my novel.

6 fuckin years. I don't even really recognize how I got here, or why I was lucky and figured it out. It's definitely a process to get out of it, I know that much.

You have to give yourself a real chance, and it takes time. Getting sober for 3 months and expecting your world to be peachy after x amount of years of getting high. Keep at it knowing you will be happy again, and one day you'll look back wondering as well... how you got there.

We learn right from wrong at a early age. We all know our addiction was full of bad decisions, it's never too late to start making good ones. Keep your head up fellas, wishing you all the best.

Clean from 2015-2017ish... relapsed recreationally sep 17- a few times before I met a beautiful girl Jan 2018 and we hit it off and started dating after a few months. Strongest I’ve ever felt about anyone, and I’ve been in plenty relationships. 

Due to unforeseen circumstances and me being a prick, staying out late, having a few drinks, I got in an accident at work and lost a good career I’ve worked for... this mixed with my s/o was out of the country really set me on the path of relapse.   

Fast forward to full blown fentanyl addiction before holidays 2018 I tell her, I have an addiction issue (out of left field) and she doesn’t know how to deal, kinda is unsupportive due to not being from a drug using type of world or knowing really anyone involved with anything like that.  She honestly walked out ending things than a few min later came back in after realizing that was kinda fucked up. 

Fast forward til now, I’ve never sought professional help, I told her I’d handle it, really extending my own problem, I cut usage to once a wwwk once every two weeks maybe and figured I was content with getting fucked up, feeling out of it for a few days and then abstaining til a certain date, it really took a toll on us and our social life, things obviously got stale. I didn’t wanna do anything literally sex didn’t bring me joy lol. 

Fast forward to Jan 2020 and I strung together a month, New Years was pretty normal, Valentine’s Day went well, things were looking up than COVID lockdown hit.  This slowed socially rebuilding things down, I honestly started using a bit more because us sitting home tg all the time ( we don’t live together ) kinda made it boring; we’d hang less frequently, one day I lost it emotionally and kinda blew up at her explaining in the wrong way how I’ve been struggling and she had no idea because “she didn’t care” because I was still relapsing and she had no idea. She ended things there and then. *to keep it short* may 2020 we broke up got back tg June 2020 and ended before aug 2020. 

August 2020 til now I’ve met a girl, Who absolutely adores me and supports me in a lot of ways my ex didn’t when it comes to recovery and understands it more, and truthfully I’ve relapsed a few times since August and I’ve been honest with her and she’s supported me and I’m a lot more open to talk to her, she’s talked me out of shit so there’s that.  

I kinda need some advice if anyone’s been here before.... i relapsed the last few weeks about once per week, everytime I relapse the days following i get a bit emotional, hit my ex up we’ve met up it’s been confusing, last time we met we hooked up and it really felt great but she has her guard up and will always revert back to how we can’t speak and confuse each other....
Is this my mind all scrambled from constant relapse? Like basically going thru a roller coaster of getting high than not really and once I relapse I’m reverted back to previous emotions that I’ve worked sober to get over to an extent and when I relapse emotions come rushing back......

I’m def ready to remain clean I know that’s the golden rule here but 
1.  Should I let go of the thought of being with my ex in the future because it basically took place during active addiction? And it’s mostly my mind fabricating memories to make it seem better than it was? 

2.  Does anyone have experience with anything similar to this? 

3. The girl I’m with is fucking excellent. I notice the longer stretches of me being clean which is only a few weeks but once the clouds start to clear to do enjoy the time with her and care for her.  Due to relapses ramping up I see myself longing for my ex when I was constantly relapsing with her also, miserable doing everything with them both..

2020-10-28 02:18:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/jjin5i/need_some_support/,Need some support,"Hi all,

I want to preface this with an apology, not sure if you thinking I’m overreacting or not!

I started taking codeine and DHC about 16 months ago, as many of you UK guys know, you could get them from online pharmacies easily, at one point I was taking around 10-12 30mg DHC and 6-10 30mg phosphate every day.

When the ban came on online pharmacies I quickly dropped my usage to 8 Nurofen+ per day. I was doing this for a while until my OCD started up again and I started taking more.

My usage during lockdown was around 8 paramol and 16 Nurofen+ per day. This continued until a few weeks ago when I thought I can’t go on anymore, the pharmacy visits, it was all getting fucking ridiculous.

I started a taper schedule, with a fast taper to start.  I’m now on 4 paramol a day and 8 Nurofen+ per day, which is barely anything compared to last year but I wanna quit so much. I do 2 paramol and 6 Nurofen twice per day.

I’m planning on dropping two tablets per week, is this feasible? Part of me wants to just CT but I’m petrified of WD and I’m starting to get anxiety from the taper.  I’m on meds for anxiety and OCD, I’ve had therapy too but to no avail, hence why I started taking codeine.

What would you guys do? Am I being pathetic? If I go CT I wont have any comfort meds aside from Imodium and Paracetamol, I don’t want diazepam, I’ve had it before used my script straight away.  I have my fiancée as a support system but going to my GP is out of the question. It’s too much of a risk in case they tell me I need to inform the DVLA, I can’t afford to lose my license even though I never drive after taking tablets. 

Sorry for the rambling, I just need some specific help for my situation from people who have been there.

Thanks everyone.",3

For the most part google just scared the shit out of me so that was probably a mistake. I was using H and Meth for maybe 2.5 years and (long story short) was forced to quit both CT almost 3 years ago. I went on suboxone right away at that point and after maybe 1.5 years I started getting super bad depression and anxiety/panic attacks, even if I took another couple MG it didht really help. Doctors couldn’t tell me shit so I decided maybe my body was trying to tell me something and/or I’m just an unlucky one, who knows. Thank god for Kratom because I was able to get out from under the pure hell of sub WDs . Accept then I ended up on Kratom for another 6 mos. I finally made the jump CT 9 weeks ago and I’m still so fuking depressed and don’t want to move my body. I can’t even stand myself anymore and really see why people go back to using. I keep thinking that I have F’d up my brain and this is my life now and then I’ll read a post somewhere saying just hang on this feeling is normal and it will get better. I’ve read it takes 30 days, 60,90,6 mos,12 &14 months! Wtf? Do doctors know even what causes it? With all the research I’ve done I know for fact that I’m not getting the dopamine that I need to just feel normal and have a happy thot once in a while. There’s probably other stuff I’m low on too but I think based on what I’ve read about low dopamine that’s got me written all over it (and probably anyone quitting) I wasn’t trying to write this much stuff down and I apologize for it, I’ll just say what I could use advice on if anyone knows, 
1) will this PAWS depression really go away and 
2) my dr put me on Wellbutrin because it’s the only AD that works on dopamine, he also added abilify to it but I’ve been trying to get info on it because I’m afraid it’s the same thing as suboxone in that it’s a partial opioid agonist and a antagonist (supposedly it takes away dopamine from spots where there’s to much D and it adds dopamine where not enough). If it is a bandaid like subs then I would just be continuing the exact thing I’m trying so hard to get away from. Does anyone know if it’s to heal the brain or is it just opioid therapy in a more round about way then say subs are? Feel like shit asking people to read all that but I’m not deleting it now lol.

I'd been opiate-free for several months since the whole lockdown thing started in March, mainly because I couldn't get enough access to pharmacies and a big source of my anxiety was being alleviated due to being able to work from home. But when the lockdown restrictions eased a bit and ongoing relationship problems raised themselves again, I started going on little shopping trips ""to get myself out of the house a bit"". I started ducking into a pharmacy during these trips every couple weeks and picking up a box of Paramol to do a CWE on (for those not in the UK, this is DHC and APAP you can buy over the counter). Considering my tolerance levels in the past, it didn't take long for it to rise back to what it used to be. I also began ordering codeine lintcus online and drinking the nasty shit over the course of about 2 days. I've now gotten into a routine of pharmacy hopping every week for Paramol (DHC), as codeine does almost nothing unless I can get it in big quantities at once. This shit is worse than the online pharmacy hopping I used to do back when those were still an option, not least because you get so little from each CWE. Thankfully, I still remain too chicken-shit to explore the dark web markets and suspect I will always remain that way because I truly don't know enough to keep myself safe there.

I'm just so tired of it. I fucking hate these pharmacy runs, having to force myself to go out to multiple pharmacies on the outskirts of town just for a few day's supply.  Some pharmacists have started giving me suspicious looks, though I must say the face masks have been a blessing in disguise there.

I know I have drifted over a certain threshold because I've started feeling withdrawals again whenever I go a day or two without. As always, I thought I had it under 'control' to once or twice a week use but honestly for the past month or so I've gone barely a day without at least something in my system. So I suppose the return of withdrawals was inevitable. 

Unfortunately, I'm not even ready to stop. As much as I hate having to drag myself outside when I'm feeling withdrawal begin, I hate the feeling of not being high more. Its absolutely pathetic but my life is nothing without those moments of respite when I get to feel something other than crushing sadness.

I just had to get this off my chest. Doing all of this in secret has built up inside me.",4

Started with my buddy handing me half of a pressed 30 this February (2020), i spent the next day puking my guts out driving to and from LAX. I said never again, but that first high was like smoking weed for the first time. Pure euphoria. So it was more like once every 2 weeks, then every week, and soon enough, around May,  I was doing them everyday, COVID taking my job away didn’t help and the unemployment checks definitely gave me enough to do what I wanted. So I did. It went on like that for way too long, my mental health which mind you was already very rocky, only worsened severely. Not to mention I lost all of my body structure and my face sucked in like a skull. I used to be so athletic I could’ve ran a mile in less than 5 minutes.  I ruined my body. 

So why, after knowing how hard of a negative impact percs have left on my life, why the FUCK am I still in love with them?

I seriously Kant get a grip on myself. I’m disgusted with how I’m literally thinking of busting down pills 24 fucking 7. I have visions of using. I feel like I’m having the hardest mental battle of my life to stay Klean. I have insanely strong urges to sniff something, I’ve even got in Kontact with my dealers just to fucking tease myself I Kant take this I don’t know what helps I’m not optimistic at all.

All I hear is that things get easier and I’m seriously sick of that because things have only been getting worse since I was like 16. I don’t know what I’m gonna do I know relapsing is inevitable but it’s just this Konstant inside war with myself I know I’ll lose eventually. I’m hopeless.

the MASKED pain once the pills wear off are horrible..but are they withdrawal pains or actually there? Between my nose burning, face swelling & neck pain, I can't bare it.

I’m hoping this is the best place for some advice about relationships with persons in recovery, and some independent pointers..
I recently started a relationship with someone who is 4yrs into recovery and I’m slowly getting to know them, and as a result now know that:
- they are 4yrs in, but that relapse can be a possibility for some
- they took Heroin and Ecstasy, Heroin being the one they couldn’t control most
- they were sent to rehab and it was only when a major event happened they got the shock to start recovery themselves 
- that they know their triggers and as part of that have put work into not exposing themselves to them as part of recovery and done a good job at it 
- they have a sponsor and continually put effort into recovery 

However last weekend I had a conversation with them about their recovery and their whole face lit up with excitement over describing Heroin, and it *totally shook me* as it was the first time I saw my boyfriend in that light. 

It made me realise that this isn’t a trivial or light subject, and i need to fully understand recovery if I want to be sure this is something I can handle, and support him in. I don’t take drugs and have never been remotely interested so I really have no idea.

So I’m looking for ideas and insight into this subject. Things to read, watch, questions to ask.

When he was younger, he went to rehab because he had a serious pill problem and told me that it’s nothing like it was before. He takes 10 mg daily and claims that such a small dose will be easy to get off of. 

I don’t think he has ever been clean for too long, but this is a dealbreaker and he promised to get clean. He’s starting an outpatient detox program this month. My question is, what does being on pain pills for so long do to you longterm? How can I support him without enabling him? Am I setting myself up for disaster?  

Things I have noticed:

* He bites pills, not only pain ones.
* Restless legs in the morning and has a hard time staying asleep. Sometimes, he takes sleeping pills or Xanax to help him sleep.
* Night sweats.
* Low sex drive. We have sex like once a week. 
* I’m pretty sure he takes laxatives every day. I read that pain meds can constipate you, so wondering if that’s why?
* Late night binges.

He’s amazing and I love him so much, but I am afraid that this is going to be a very long battle and am not sure how to proceed and feel like this may break our relationship.",12

I just wanted to let the blahness out early this morning so I can try to salvage the rest of the day :) Thanks for reading.

I started using drugs in my teens as an escape. I just wanted peace and quiet. That led me to find more and more escapes and spend a lot of time alone.

Fast forward and I'm 30 and not currently using, but I'm still so lonely and I don't have the drugs to keep me company.

I'm waking up sober in this life I built throughout 10 years of mostly active addiction. I moved away from family and I live alone out here on the west coast. I was working remotely before the pandemic--I pursued a career path with extremely high pay and autonomy. I studied and got masters degrees from prestigious universities all to be able to afford drugs and be left alone.

I've certainly hurt my family, but we've tried so many times to fix things and we just don't  get anywhere. It's about way more than just things I've done as an addict. Even therapists advise me to let go of them. I guess I always had some fantasy about getting my relationship with my parents back, but now I'm just realizing we never really had one and that was a factor leading me to addiction.

So here's to another Sunday alone. I don't have much work next week. This quarantine is really getting to me. This is the part of my sobriety where I should be getting out there and meeting new people. Maybe take a job that forces me into an office for accountability in sobriety. But I'm left here alone with my thoughts and sometimes I can get fresh air with a mask on.",28

How's everyone else? I believe in you, whatever stage of addiction, recovery or sobriety you're at!",1

I started working as I have been unemployed for 4 months so that's giving me a little self esteem. I have noticed when I'm out and about or at work I have to force myself sometimes to get up and go but once I'm active I have a little more energy...once I'm home I seem to get tired and just want to lay in bed. The obvious response would be to continue getting out but I also can't just be away 24/7 because I love spending time with my family...I have been taking1-2 hour naps almost daily lately...at first I dealt bad about it but then I remind myself well I would rather be napping then snorting heroin 24/7...I've started drinking energy drinks and smoking cigarettes but I don't know if they're helping any...I also have been keeping this entire addiction a secret from everyone aside from the users on reddit and obviously my plugs the past 8 years and would like to kinda vent to someone or find ways of just pressing on. I have heard some people say ""man things just seem brighter,more clear and crisp after a few weeks and in some cases I feel I've noticed but others I have self doubt.

I still think about you and Rosie every day and I will every single day I’m alive, but now, before I do see you again, I want to live this life I still am blessed to have to the fullest. I want to do the things you didn’t get to do and go back to all the places you loved so much. I want to accomplish the things we talked about and learn about the things you had such a passion for. I don’t think I will ever be “okay” but for now this will do. I see your face now and i am filled with love and nostalgia instead of anger and confusion. Of course I’m still angry and confused, but that’s not what I want to dwell on. Thank you my angel for picking me to spend the last 5 years with and for loving me so fiercely and so unconditionally.

What an emotionel mess I was just days ago, loneliness, dispair and pain was all I could feel, but turning to actively write on this sub (NA meetings as well) really makes a difference. It's so true that pain losens it's grib on you when shared with others.

Translating my f***ed up emotions into words, and just spilling them out, openly for others to hear/read about, and getting responses from people that knows exactly what I'm going through, is such a relieve.

So to anyone going through the pain of withdrawal (at least the emotional part), please share. It will not make it go away, but it really makes a difference knowing you are not alone going through this. 

And to everyone on this sub, thank you for beeing here, helping others, including myself, going through hard and lonely times. You people really makes a difference.

I have had cancer 3 times, and I’m in a right old state, health-wise. I’m in the Uk and at present I am prescribed 224 20mg Oxycodone IR, monthly.  I have been prescribed Pregabalin up until mid-2018, but it wasn’t effective after 2-3 months and being addicted to opiates is bad enough, without adding benzodiazepenes into the mix. I do not and have not procured drugs illicitly. I am a University lecturer and I held my job until 4 years ago when I suffered my third cancer and work finally became untenable. However, I am so far gone atm both pain and addiction-wise, that if I was offered illicit opiates now, I would struggle to say no.

This year, pretty much for the entirety, my chronic pain has been through the roof, and also further exacerbated by suffering from Covid for over 4 months, which was a terrible ordeal. This has resulted in me taking more Oxycodone than I have been prescribed. Quite a lot more, and I am wracked - completely wracked - with guilt and shame. Furthermore, I haven’t a clue about what to do next. I’m usually very ‘well-behaved’ when it comes to my medications.

I’m fearful of going to my Doctor and telling her how many tablets I have been taking - it’s WAY too many and she’ll go crackers!  I’ve also never been to drug services in my life, and I’m uncertain what they will do, as I have genuine, extremely complex health needs - yet I feel that this is the right thing to do. Up until I contracted Covid, I was prescribed 80mg of Oxycodone daily (4 x 1 20mg per day). I can handle this amount - it doesn’t make me crave much and it gives a little relief, pain-wise, but not much. But whenever I have been on more than this, the Oxycodone gets it’s claws into me and I really struggle to maintain an acceptable dosage routine. 

So ideally, I need to just ignore pain, and get down to 4 x 20mg tablets daily - but unfortunately my pain is through the roof at present and I am finding reducing incredibly difficult. Furthermore, I am also considering ditching opiates altogether for a while and see how I can manage — maybe it’ll be easier than I think? In which case,  I could maybe go down the ‘Buprenorphine’ route? I was prescribed these for a year or so around the turn of the millennium purely for pain relief and they were indeed quite effective. Whether they still would be, I’m not sure - a lot of time has passed.

So I run out of Oxycodone roughly two weeks before my prescription is actually due (in about a week’s time) and I’ve no solid plans about what to do? Apologies for the huge essay - but If any of you wise folk on Reddit could offer any advice regarding my next steps on this craziness, I will be so, so grateful.

Kind Regards,

Mark.",5

Until I got ahold of some fake hydrocodone a few years ago and was blacked out for 3 days. It was one of the worst times of my life. At that time I was switching between pills and suboxone when I couldnt find the pills. After that scare my husband helped me wean down off suboxone (always bought on the street) and i was clean for almost 5 years. 
    Then about 8 or 9 months ago I ran into an old dealer. He was only selling suboxone and like a dumbass I started buying some from him. Hidden from my family again. Well as the months went on I was taking more and more.... 3 days ago I decided fuck this. Dont even get me high anymore I was back to only staying well. So I fought myself for 3 days until this morning I decided if I'm getting off this shit again I had to tell my husband wtf been going on. So I broke down woke him up and told him. And this man is so supportive I dont deserve it. Hes a recovering alcoholic and had other issues with drugs mostly cocaine years ago. We do smoke weed illegally unfortunately cause were in texas but that's it. Been married 19 years and I couldnt do this without him.
      I have no withdrawal symptoms yet but I know they're coming. I took 2mg tuesday morning and that's my last dose. I can get thru the sickness now that I told him and dont have to hide it anymore. It's a burden off my shoulders that if I was still hiding it the guilt and anxiety would have drove me to use again. I know it would have. Anyways just thought I'd post and share my story. Day 2 no suboxone and I'm not looking back. I read all the threads here and alot of them give me hope for the future, clean me.... the better me. Thank you guys so much for reading. Good luck to  all of us with this shit disease.

He suddenly disappeared after he made that post and reappear again around 3 years ago with an update of the different lifestyle he had been living in sobriety from the last 6 years. 

There’s been almost 4 years since that ultimate post he did on his account so nobody knows what has it been for him ever since that year (2016 I think). 

I wonder if he is still sober and having a good life with probably his family and he being a father at this point. Probably taking care of his family became his top one priority and he just doesn’t spend any time on social media platforms anymore.

Either that or he may have had a relapse or something at some point of these three years from his last update, and the reason he hasn’t made any update anymore is because he doesn’t have any good reason to probably do it...",4

Bit of a blur","Basically, my supplier was meant to get 3.5g of H to me last Saturday (ok so Saturday morning was last use). I expected it to get to my on Monday, Tuesday latest etc. Became clear it wasn't coming. I didn't have the money to replace it, phoned all potential plugs, best I got was tramadol which I have been using to help taper. I basically decided on Tues (at the very very peak of wd) that there is nothing I can do and I'm just going to use this opportunity to get clean (well, be a minor tramadol addict and not a major heroin addict).

My worry is that in early paws, I get my 3.5gs, and that I have the strength to flush it. I'll try to do it without thinking. I feel a lot better already and I'm not back to work until next Wednesday.

Ofc detox was absolute hell, I get the vomiting so bad and I'm a zombie during it. My girlfriend however is an absolute Saint and she shows me so much affection and does everything I need to... Stay alive and mentally sound even when the best I can muster in return is slurred humming ""I love you too', but it's more 'eh uhv oooh ooh', can't turn my head etc and ofc I'm tossing and turning all night, she doesn't mind, it's great, and gives me incentive to not do this to her again.

Sorry this thread has gone on a bit long so I'll wrap things up. a perfect storm of me having time off work and my supply running out forced me off H. Are there any cases here where long term sobriety was achieved in these conditions?",5

My first love was on opiates.,"Hey guys. Im 2 months sober now. I feel free and normal life became normal again. Im in my mid 20's and never had a girlfriend before. I met my first GF this year. At the beginning of this year, I was most likely on oxy. Not the nodding type of high, but more like euphoric and energetic type of high. 

I met her out ouf nowhere, fell totally in love. I kinda discovered what opiates replaced in my life. Love and secureness. That was all she gave me. 

Well the problem is, I was still totally high while dating her. Every date was warm and awesome, because I was high all the time. I can remember our first beach vacation, just laying on the sand with her, her hand going through my hair, me totally high on oxy and ""love-endorphines"". It felt like paradise. Never felt this great and blessed before. Discovering love and beeing slighty high on oxy, I feel like it made my love to her even more intense. 

Unfortunately she already left me. I loved her much more than oxys. So I made the desicion to get sober. If I can live without her, than It should be possible to live sober. And did it.

Im scared now, that my dates in the future will be trash compared to those. Not only because she was my first love, but because I was on oxy all the time. So I was endorphine loaded pretty much nonstop. Im scared that I will throw away good girls in the future or will always think about my ex, because those pills made those memeories very special. 

Can you tell me something more about this? Can you relate? Were you able to love again after recovering?",9
2020-10-22 03:22:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/jfv2gn/struggling_getting_sober_please_read/,"Struggling getting sober, please read","I'll try to keep this short. When I was a kid I was diagnosed with a medical condition that required over 10 surgeries and I'll have chronic pain forever. They started me on #3 codeine and it was okay I only took two 30MG a day. Then I got a pain management doctor and they gave me oxy and I loved it. I just kept increasing my dose until my mom passed away and i got really depressed. My dad convinced my doctor to stop giving me opioids when I turned 18 because they said I needed rehab. I didn't want to go through withdrawal cold turkey so I went but really only got the detox. I was able to convince the people there that I wasn't addict and that I was just there because I had been on high doses of oxy from just my tolerance building from being on them so long from being in the hospital. I was out 10 days after detox and did outpatient rehab for a bit but didn't really participate. Fast forward I was sober for three months and then I had a bad fare up of my medical issue and had to go to the hospital. I'm allergic to morphine so they gave me fentanyl which I've gotten before only while in the hospital though and it didn't help so they gave me dilaudid and that's when everything spiraled out of control. I had started to suppress my emotions about my mom passing with pills. And if I was in the hospital I would say I was in more pain than I actually was to get more or higher doses of dilaudid. I hate I did that since people who really need it deserve it not me. Anyways, I was taking 12 Oxy 10MG at a time every 6-8 hours or so for weeks. Paid for them with some money I had unexpectedly come into. A lot of money + addiction don't work well. I ended up lowering my pill dose to like 20-30MG doses but would just go to the ER like every few days just so I wouldnt get sick. If I couldnt get pills on the street is go to the hospital. My dad then kicked me out along with my brother and sent me to california to live with my aunt but my dad and her always talked so awfuk towerds me and treated me like a piece of shit. If I wanted a tylenol for a headache they'd just say I just want to pop a pill. If I said I had anxious they'd say I have nothing to be anxious about. I was told if I went to the hospital I would not be allowed back. I ended up having to go to the hospital for a few reasons, I was feeling sick from withdrawal, my medical stuff was flaring, and I had a weird skin issue going on. So I left and was homeless but made my way to LA. I never spent a night on the street since I'd just go to the ER at night to avoid sleeping on the street since I'm a small female and was scared to get raped or something. I ended up getting into a woman's shelter and I hadn't really had anything IV in about a month but been talking pills daily but only 20MG every 4-6 hours but then I ended up having to get another surgery which just made shit worse again. They were giving me dilaudid 2 MG every 2 hours. And then sent me home with a bunch of oxy. And when I'd run out I'd just go back to the hospital and get a new script or get admitted to get more dilaudid. I then went from the shelter to a temporary hotel for people at risk of getting covid and once again I'd go to the hospital every three days or so to get my fix so I wouldn't be sick. Just like I did in my hometown. Finally I got into my own apartment but they require I either work or go to school full time but I can't do either of those if I'm in and out of the hospital. I just got out of the hospital again today after being there for 1 1/2 weeks. I had been so desperate to get admitted to a hospital that I would go hospital to hospital by bus all night till one would give me pain meds and admit me. They also sent me home with 15MG oxy this time and I just don't know what to do. I'm so tired or trying. I want to get sober so I can live a normal life. When I'm off pills and I'm in active withdrawal I can't do anything like not even go grocery shopping. All I think about is getting high. And planning what I'll have to do when I run out of these pills. I'm just worried that when I get clean how I can deal with this pain from my medical issue without going overboard. Like I wish I had the self control to only take it when I really needed it. I've tried to detox myself but I just am having a hard time since I'm really depressed and just don't want to live and some points. But at the same time I want to get clean and be happy. Sorry this was long. I hope at least one person read it and can give me advice",2

Induction/PWDs/Bernese (x-post r/suboxone).,"Ok, so I'm trying to get onto subs (without a dr./rehab). I have acquired some 8mg strips. I was able to get about 20hrs off H (usually about 1-2g/day snorted), but wasn't quite enough into WDs (8 COWS) to be confident enough that I wouldn't go into PWDs, so I relapsed. I want to give it a try again, but I want some more information so I'm a bit more confident about what I'm doing.

- My current plan is to stop H at 8pm, then the following day at around 8pm, and when I'm at a 10-12 COWS, start taking 0.5-1mg of subs until my WDs go away. Whatever amount I took, I'll take daily (experimenting with taking a bit less). My goal is to only be on subs for 7-10 days to cushion my WDs to get off H.

- I've read stories of people being in PWDs for 1-3 days. What I don't understand, is if 16-24 hours is the recommended time for enough full agonist/H to leave the receptors in order to take the first dose of Subs, without getting PWDs, why would taking it a few hours early, cause days of PWDs, rather than just hours (i.e. the difference between when you took it(let's say 16hrs), and when you should have taken it(lets say 24 hrs), this would make sense to me that you're in PWDs for 8hrs, but I don't understand why it could be days)?

- If someone goes into PWDs, what is the best way to minimize it? Taking more subs, or taking more full agonist/H?

- Is there any way to do a Bernese method with 8mg strips? I saw the first dose was like 0.1mg, which is impossible to dose with a 8mg strip and a pair of scissors.

- Is PWDs based on the dose of subs? Meaning if I'm at an 8-10 COWS, and I take 0.5 mg of a sub, will that throw me less into PWDs than 1mg would? Is 0.5mg-1mg too much to start with, should I just cut off a minuscule amount of the 8mg strip and try that?

Would love some answers to these questions, and any other advice. I've read up quite a bit, but obviously there's a lot of mixed info out there. I'm aware that it's better for me to do this with Dr/Rehab's help, but that's just not an option for me right now, so please don't give me a hard time about that.",1

I wanted to die every day and used H instead of suicide. 

I don't know, something clicked,
maybe its because so many have died, but I doubt it. going to AA helped me significantly by just learning from more seasoned addicts how its a 1 way trip to death. Maybe seeing alcholics in the end from my family and just how brutal and nasty it is.

But if you just start a little every day. I know it feels impossible the first day. But I had weight lifted before my addiction so it made it easier to get back into. 
Most important:get Sun every single day for vitamin D and energy/dopamine
Just lift weights, situps pushups cardio running walking.  as long as you do something you feel better about yourself and its easier to do again the next day. 2 months later after forcing myself I couldn't even skip it because I want to work out. It feels good for your body to feel healthy after being unhealthy for so long. healthy diet plus a regiment of thorough excercise can change your entire mindset of what is possible and impossible.

I liked to use drugs to last longer during sex. Since stopping I haven't had much success in finding an alternative to this. I've read many ways to help, but I haven't experienced the same results and I think it is due to my history with opiates, so I wanted to ask other addicts what they have done. Below are some methods I've tried without much success.

&#x200B;

Sertraline/Zoloft 50mg  
Suboxone 2-4mg  
Kratom 6-8g

I also want to try Gabapentin/Neurontin \~1500mg but have not tried it yet.

&#x200B;

I've read a lot about Sertraline helping and even being prescribed commonly for PE. I imagine it's not helping me because those people didn't have a history with opiates.

Suboxone didn't help at all, but maybe because it is a low dose? I have quite a bit of clean time ATM, which is why I'm surprised Suboxone didn't work.

Kratom seemed to have given me the best results (I would actually highly recommend it to anyone with the same issue), but I'm posting to see if maybe there is a better method out there.

Are there other methods? Has anyone tried Gabapentin?

My intake rose to about 300mg (or 180mg DHC) once a week in the evening, which was manageable. 

However, since lockdown in March I've found myself doing it more often. Rising to twice a week (two days consecutively), but these past few weeks I've been doing it even more often, 3 or 4 nights a week. I know the main reason is boredom, I hate the idea of a sober evening (I do Pregabalin twice a week but I'm ok with that), rather than trying to escape from things. 

But it's become more of a habit and I can sense my mind trying to trick me into taking more ""It'll be ok just this once, just don't do it for a week"" etc. It's a really insidious, seductive drug, and removes the need for human contact, which ties into the whole isolating thing of lockdown. 

I'm thinking of getting a time lock safe and only allowing myself to have it once a week. But I really want to know some words of advice on it all. I don't want to quit entirely, just go back to the weekly schedule I held for nearly a decade. I don't like having the reduced sex drive, plus I'm always really grumpy and unpleasant to be around the day after a session, plus I've found myself avoiding doing work (I'm a freelance writer), which is bad for my career obviously. I have no doubt that I wouldn't be in this position if it was a normal year and I had weekend nights with friends out to look forward to, but I need to sort things out before things hopefully get back to normal with a vaccine next year. 

Can you guys with similar habits and experiences share your experiences on what worked for you?

I have been clean from heroin for 5 years but have been on methadone ever since. I've tried coming off it twice but I just couldn't do it. Anyway, I fell into a depression right after quitting heroin. It was so bad that I couldn't keep a job and just really didn't care about anything. I know that depression right after you quit using is a thing but it has never gone away. I have a job now that is decent and I plan on staying put, but only because I have to.
I have my first grandchild coming into the world in a few months so you'd think I'd be super happy but I'm just not. I mean, I can take it when I need to but I rarely even do that anymore. I used to be someone that couldn't sit still long enough to watch a movie and now anytime I'm not working I'm sitting on the couch doing nothing. For 5 years!

Also I can't find a definitive answer on what the co nversion is from oral methadone to sublingual subutex

Thanks in advance",1

Constantly rationalizing my use and going from Lilly pad to Lilly pad to maintain a level of dope to avoid withdrawing. Even when I went to get help I was negotiating with my mind that I’d go in for two days tops to clean up, then when my refill was ready get out and pick up and start again. I just got home from work, and just from working barely two months I’m offered a promotion.

What the fuck is wrong with me. I hung in so good until the shit just started getting worse and worse and worse until I had no other choice. Wondering if I just used like .2 today If I can try and go cold again for another like 48 hours and then try and take a small amount of sub without it throwing me into a precip. Withdrawal? Because normally my use was always so heavy that even if I waited 72 to take the shit it still fucked me. So I’m wondering now since I dried out for 4 days. Only used .2 and then wait another 48 after that if I could introduce sub into my system without it fucking me. I just want this to end so bad I don’t even know what else to do,2
2020-10-20 10:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/jeq81l/over_15_years_in_recovery_i_have_strength_but/,"over 1.5 years in recovery. I have strength, but feel no more appreciated than before. I'm scared I am going to break.","March of 2019, I finally decided to really try and stay away from heroin, and stick to suboxone for maintenance instead of money breaks between bags. I have had three week long relapses since then, with months in between, currently I am about 4 months from the last. But I still hate my life. I still feel like I'm destined to be perpetually miserable and lost in my future.

Basically, I feel like no one really cares about me. I have to reach out to EVERYONE and make EVERYTHING happen. Which means I have to always have good days if I want things to get done. If I have a bad day and feel down and depressed, no one will call me or ask me to do anything. I am certain I could simply exist in my room for days and days and cease to exist among the outside world. I have had some amazing days since being sober, but it is all so temporary. My whole life has consisted of single events, with zero follow up. I'll feel like I belong for one night, and then slowly realize with the cancellations that it would never happen again. 

I'm so jealous of the people who seem like they are always in demand. Who seem like they don't have to constantly struggle to find purpose because opportunities and connections are just handed to them, their schedule made. I have so much talent, but I MUST be missing the ""sparks"" to catalyze the relationships, the connection, so it feels like everything i do is pointless and futile as nothing in my environment changes. 

The preceding paragraphs is the summary of my dilemma. If you are in a whiny mood and want company for your misery, Read on if you wish to hear the details:

I fucking hate my setting, with my narcissistic asshole of a father who will never be proud of me no matter what I do. I am moving out after graduation, but I have no job lined up. Yep, here I am with an engineering degree who will probably be stuck with a minimum wage job yet again, like collage means nothing. So shitty job --- check. Exactly the same as before I got sober.

I still am stuck with an ugly girlfriend who I have zero physical attraction, I have tried to find other girls but can't seem to get past the one night stand. I had a great one just literally disappear on me after a wonderful night, probably because I accidentally sounded creepy and desperate over texting and didn't realize it until too late. This girlfriend still has stuck around even with me telling her my issues and telling her that I'm seeing other girls, hmmmm..... I do think if she lost a lot of weight I might change my mind, but its been 4 years and no change.... So shitty girlfriend --- check. Exactly the same as before I got sober.

I have a band with wonderful music, but the band leader is my 64 year old uncle, who is just like my dad, and proceeds to treat me like a little child in front of everyone because of our family ties. The music is the only thing that keeps me to this project, it's amazing. But I just cannot see myself touring with my uncle because I hate being around him. Plus, he has like zero drive on the music, he literally can't initiate any practice or recording session. And if he gets mad at me he threatens to end the band right then and there, like it means nothing to him and all my work is gone. So shitty band  --- check. I have lost bands from my drug use in the past so I guess still having this project after a few months is a win for me, I guess.

I hope that moving out and getting my own place will solve many of these problems, and at least feel like I have something to show for my sobriety. The best thing about being sober is that I AM READY for a challenge, but nothing comes my way. It's like my environment just encourages apathy and bullshit. All I want is to be part of a happening, to feel like I fit in, to use the talents I worked so hard to develop. I especially wish for real purpose, it is so hard to work on anything when it looks like your accomplishments do nothing to further you in life.  It still feels like I am no more respected and loved than I was when I was shooting heroin. I don't want to use anymore, I know I have strengths, but I just can't seem to find any momentum.

Thank you for reading this far, its a lot to process.",1

2020-10-18 16:33:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/jdnq6t/2_months_sober_what_if/,2 months sober. What if...?,"Hey guys. Im 2 months sober soon. New year is coming, I cant drink alcohol because my body reacts very hard and weird to it ( kinda like allergic reaction ). There are a few thoughts in my mind which I want to ""play through"" if it could work. (Dont worry, even tho what I will write down sounds like a relapse, it isnt. I promise. Those are just ""what if"" ideas, which has not the power now to make me do it )

Well, first of all, I feel very good. My cravings are much less than I expected. I learned that I can live without taking opiates daily and its such a blessing waking up, feeling good and dont have to think about the first dose after getting up. Im missing anything in my life right now, except my ex girlfriend. So my psyce is on a strong position. I kinda believe, that I could use opiates not as a daily helper anymore, but as a ""special-day"" buffer. So like MAX 1x every 2, or better 3 weeks. Even though I feel strong myself, I know I could get weak no matter who I am, because in fact, I was addicted and this will never change. Thats the reason why I talked with my non addicted best friend about it. I need to drive 5 hours(!!!) to get my opiates and the guy who sells me it, dosnt have always some. Thats a good thing, because driving 5h is a pain in the a** so it makes very difficult for me to get some pills. Trust me, the pain driving 5 hours is heavier than the love to getting high for me 😂. I have no other connections and im not in search for it. So my idea was to give all of my pills to my best friend and I tell him, if I make him the slightest feel that I want to consume more than 1x every 2 or 3 weeks and try to get more than that from him, than he have to flush it and slap me to wake me up. 

Do you guys think something like that can work? Would my body show WD symptoms by only taking it 1x with very huge breaks between? Im not a fan of nodding, so Im talking about a dose which makes you just feel active and euphoric. Never did a huge break like this since 4 years so I really dont know how by body would react. I really dont want my body to make me feel uncomfortable just by using it a single time after almost 2 months. I cannot predict my addictive brain. 

Are there people out there for whom that worked well? Taking it with a time plan after a few years of addiction?. The thing is, I quit opiates because taking it daily just let me feel horrible. The past year I just took it, not for getting high, but for my body to stop shaking. It didnt destroyed anything big in my life yet, maybe changed my personality. But it will if I start daily again. I never started to take opiates because I wanted to escape reality. My reality is good. Nice job, much money... kinda miss a girlfriend tho since that chick left me. But the biggest lesson I learned in my life is, daily consume = makes me only feel sick, will make me a terrible and addicted dad someday and Ill have to carry my pills around to just ""function"". My anxiety to get back there for what I fighted 2 months for are just too high so I dont want to make any silly desicions. Being sober on bdays and new year etc sucks tho. 

To make it short

What happens after 2 months of soberty and you take one hit, will your body instantly show WD reactions? (If you want to know the dose : 16-32mg hydro, or 40-80mg Oxy would to the trick I guess)

Did ""timed consuming"" worked for you? Will it work in my case with the help of my friend? If not, why do you think so? Is it a 100% relapsing idea to get back to daily consuming? Why is it so? 
 
And again, just a few thoughts in my mind. Nothing to worry about :) I have tramadol just 2 feets next to me, sitting here. Didnt touched it yet, not even hold it for 2 months now. So im in a really good sober state right now. That what gives me the idea, that maybe my psyce is really strong enough to just make those special days more special and live the the rest of the days just sober and free from the chains.",2

Does this mean I can lower my tolerance by taking gabapentin for a few days with a week-long break or does it have some kind of effect I don't know about that doesn't help lower the amount needed on days where I don't take gabapentin or if it doesn't help lower tolerance in general?

I hope the way I worded that makes sense. I really want to take less of my opioid meds, but tapering is hard with the high amount of pain I deal with. I'm not trying to become dependent on gaba, so I don't plan on taking it for more than 3-4 days in a row without a 7 day break or so",1

I won't go too much into detail about the trip itself in this post as that's already been very well covered, I'll try to make this more about the journey afterwards.

I want to start off by saying I have been doing very well, not a smidgen of cravings so far. I myself still have a hard time believing how effective ibogaine is, I mean I was expecting it to help me, but this, this is something else. Like I said in my original post it feels like I cheated my way out of addiction, compared to suboxone or methadone this is on another level completely, even while on suboxone or methadone the cravings never truly go away but right now it feels like I was never even addicted. I remember the first few days after the ibogaine I was really hesitant to say how well it worked because I couldn't believe it, it felt like someone was playing a joke on me and the cravings would pop up laughing and saying ""did you really think it would be that easy"" but thankfully that hasn't happened.

When I truly saw how effective ibogaine is was about 5 days after my experience, I was walking down the street and saw someone shooting up, and instead of getting the jealous feeling in my chest, wishing that was me(Im sure you all know what I'm talking about) I just felt sorry for the dude. I know some people don't share my experience and the cravings do come back, but what I really think helped me was all the preparation I did going in to the experience. I was on about 2g of fentanyl a day and I managed to taper down to 5g of kratom a day. Some people might say well why did you need the ibogaine you were almost home free, but the point of ibogaine is not for the physical withdrawal, although it did completely eliminate that aswell, but the point is what it dose for the cravings and just as importantly how it completely changes your perspective on opioids and even on life. 

For the first time in years I'm actually excited for the next day, for what life has to offer, I can look into what the future has to bring and plan my life, much like an psychedelic trip it's something that is truly ineffable. I can do my best to try and describe the feeling but I couldn't hope to even get a fraction of what I feel through to you guys. 

For anyone considering Ibogaine I cannot endorse it enough and if anyone has any questions or just needs to talk please feel free to pm and find my old post if you're interested.",13

I’ve been with my GF for 6 and 1/2 years and she’s been sober from heroin for the last 5 of them. I have always been a big advocate for her recovery and unfortunately I’m one of the only people in her life that she’s close to. Her family isn’t great, and most of her old friends are still using or dead.

When we first initially started hanging out I never really expected it to go anywhere because of her addiction. I always cared for her and pushed for rehab but the endless lies and using itself made me view it more as a friends with benefits type arrangement.

Anyways, things just sort of progressed after rehab and we’ve been so busy in our lives together that her addiction wasn’t on either of our minds. 

Recently I found out that during her addiction she cheated on me early on when we had a fight and later on for drugs. Even though I’m nearly positive they weren’t long drawn out affairs it’s obviously still upsetting, especially because she hid all this from me even after rehab. 

Probably more importantly, it’s brought to the forefront the fact that she could relapse at any point in the future. Now that I’m older and considering my future more I’m wondering if I should stay with her. I know I’d never feel comfortable having children with her. 

The issue is, I’m literally her only support, closest friend and lover. She does love me, and it turns out I love her too. She has done a lot for me, and while I’ve never cheated on her, I’ve done very shitty things to her too. Now I’m so worried that leaving her will lead to a relapse, and while I know it wouldn’t be “my fault”, it’d still feel like it. 

How can I create a support system for her so if I decide to end things she doesn’t fall apart? Are there any “happily ever after” stories of addicts being in long term relationships and staying clean? Starting families? I love her so much but I don’t think I can get over the past or live with the stress of the future.",3

I'm angry 
I'm sad
literally every fucking emotion under the sun I'm so sick of losing people to this ""gang"" bullshit it's bullshit.

every year I lose a couple people to gun violence in my city we really killing was told to suck that pain up at a young age because that's the way it is. so many young opiate addicts because of the pain the streets bring and a lot of them don't really know about the trouble of opiates till it's to late. whether you get cought lacking cuz your so high you can barely keep your eyes open to the shitty side of withdrawals.

I prey all my brothers that were fun down had a peaceful and fast painless transition into the other side. 

I want to go cop pressed 30's and have a sesh but I know nun of them would want that. I'd be letting my girlfriend down that's supported me into switching to kratom (which has been god send) I don't wanna ruin the progress I've made. 

if I could I'd go and kill someone to let off some steam. some of you will probably say it's incredibly wrong but that's how I am and I was raised little no emotions but when I do feel emotions it hits hard. please no judgement as I do not feel like defending myself just wanted to rant. no one else to talk to.

sometimes I look up in the sky and wonder if anyone is looking down from my dead friends to even aliens. feel so alone if it wasn't for my gf I don't know what id do. it feels like God takes my closest friends away from me.

Or go with kratom and other comfort meds to reduce withdrawals?,"So I have done research and looked at numerous Reddit threads and I just cannot decide which route to take. I was looking into a suboxone clinic that could script me subs and get me on a plan for my oxy withdrawals but I've seen mix responses. The big thing I hope with this clinic is they can script me comfort meds like clonidine and others that would ease withdrawals and I cant get those on the streets. Im wondering whether or not it would be a good idea for me (23 YO) who has been on oxy for 7 months (about 100-140 mg a day, snorting) to do a quick suboxone taper to hop off or if I should go the Kratom route instead. If anyone has experience or opinions I would love to hear it. Reddit has been beyond helpful for me in these last few weeks as I try to break out of the opioid chains and the fact that there is such a forgiving community where addicts can go for info is truly amazing. I can't wait until im unstuck from being held back from those treacherous little blue pills and I can start to give back to organizations that help young naive people just like me. I originally used the Oxy to help me sleep but as you know it sneaky got out of hand and when I realized I couldn't stop without having noticeable withdrawals I knew I was screwed. 

On the kratom note, I have about 60 grams of Red Bali and am going to buy a white strain as well as I heard that is better to take during the day. Does anyone have experience with Kratom extract? is that a good thing to have for the first few days of WD? Any info helps! Love you guys <3",1

I'm not saying that you wanna live this way forever, but at the end of the day sometimes life gets hard. We all fall down no one is perfect and its okay to make mistakes, but the important thing is that we learn from them. However at the same time don't let our failures dictate how we feel about ourselves. This life is a struggle and its a crazy world we live in so please if you are struggling, know you aren't alone and people out there do care. Even if it may not seem like that in the moment and if you are lost don't think that means you have no purpose, because chances are you just havent found your calling. My video explains more and the direction I want to go with helping people, if you want to know my story and what really shaped me into being passionate about this, and trying to send good vibes to broken people. Is the fact I'm currently broken and if you watch my raw emotion video that's my main video. The one you see on my page that explains my situation and this video is about remembering that its okay to be lost as long as we dont choose to stay there forever. [https://youtu.be/XTA3xxDUvaA](https://youtu.be/XTA3xxDUvaA) I'm trying to create a small community where we can all come together, and I've so far helped a handful of people and if that's all I ever achieve then I'd say its well worth it.

I have a great job but I dont have a fucking penny to spare because of my H habit. My dealer could front me but i hate being in debt.

So my only reason seems to be money....my concern w quitting is that if im not ready-i set myself up for failure.

I cant afford to take any time off work to withdrawal so im thinking this might be a good time since i dont return to work till Monday.
I have kratom, i have benzos. I just need more reasons...yes objectively, i know using is bad.

But give me your REASONS, as I'm searching for mine.
It would be great if someone could give me health issues of opiate abuse [just even the act of snorting]

He snorted heroin for the first time maybe 3 weeks ago but now he's shooting up multiple times a day and starting to get physically addicted. In his second week of using heroin he overdosed for the first time and ended up in hospital.

To make matters worse, he's suffering from BPD and severe depression which prompted him to try heroin in the first place.  He is aware of the fact that he has to quit but not quite at the point of admitting that it's a serious problem yet. 

I'm trying my best to support him and check up on him regularly but I don't really know if I'm really helping him. On one hand I don't want to enable his addiction but on the other hand I also don't to alienate him. In the end he can only really help himself and I know that it's not my responsibility to save him.

Still, I care about him **a lot** and I'm scared of losing him so I want to be the best influence I can be. 

Any advice on what I can do to help him moving forward would be greatly appreciated.",1

I used to use a lot of methadone daily and have tried every opiate in the last decade. This is my second attempt. I’m moving back to my folks to save money for a new house next year, hate my job and the depression/cravings got unbearable 

For 2 days straight I was gonna hit someone up that I just found out had dillies. I was so close. I just couldn’t shake it for the last two days and was really afraid of doing something stupid. 

I looked at the Kratom and just downed 3grams. I feel much better. No cravings at all. One side of me is thankful but the other side of me makes me feel like I’ve cheated. I’ve suffered enough like anyone in recovery has. 

Is downing Kratom during crucial times cheating. I understand that suffering is necessary but you know those times you feel no emotion except the feeling of an extremely dark cloud following you everywhere and unable to shake terrible thoughts and just having non stop flashbacks of using. 

I really want a good therapist in the MN area.  I’m done with this. 

I’m not high at all. But I have zero cravings and don’t feel like offing myself anymore. 

I was so close. The depression was as if I had another person inside of me that I didn’t even know. 

It’s hard to find joy in constant loneliness during this lockdown.

Then my plan is to stop using for 24-36hrs until the WDs get bad, and then start taking a low dose of subs (initially I'll take 2mgs wait an hour or two, check my symptoms, take more if needed, etc). Then my plan is to take what I need to keep WDs at bay until my subs run out or i've been on them for about 7 days (I'm aiming for 10 max).  My main goal is to not stay on subs, as I've heard they are worse, and harder to quit than H (I won't have a script for them, I'll just pick some up). 

&#x200B;

My questions. Is this a viable plan? From the research i've done, this seems to be something that others have done/recommended. How much WD symptoms should I expect while on subs? 10%/50%/etc.? of CT WDs? Once I stop the subs, will I experience an additional round of WDs? Any other advice?",3

I’ve tried cold turkey and I just don’t have the willpower to do it. Rehab is also out of the question. 
Anyway, I got my hands on 3 strips of 8mg Suboxone. I’ve never tried using suboxone so I’m wondering if I could use these to get through the physical symptoms of withdrawal? and then when i run out hopefully The physical part will already have passed. Is this possible to do, or when i run out of subs would i go back to being sick? Also if i can do this how long do i wait to take any, how much should i take and how long should i wait between each dose? Please if anybody could give me answers i would really appreciate it.",2

So this should be interesting. 

Decriminalization or FULL legalization like alcohol?

I used to be very pro legalization while using. We all know the main reasons but for some reason after quitting, I got very upset about the BC Canada law into legalizing everything including heroin. That’s because I know I’d go to a doc and get oxys. But then again I’d call a dealer and find a way and I think I was being unjustly emotional. Even ex users like Russel Brand and many others are for decriminalization but not legalization in fear of passing encouragement. 

Is a better argument decriminalization or FULL legalization (available like alcohol) 

I thought about it a bit and to be honest, there’s a pretty good reason for legalization. We all know the arguments but here’s a summary:

1. Prohibition: Beer was the most popular drink in America. Due to limits in transportation, higher alcohol percentage drinks gained popularity. Also, alcohol consumption rates went through the roof. 

2. Crime: We don’t have a Chinese alcohol poisoning issue or rhetoric for Mexicans running across the border with alcohol. Mexico has lost tens if not hundreds of thousands of people due to the drug war, not to mention other countries. Children get involved. Women get killed. Police become useless. Criminals own countries. It affects us. For all those who say it doesn’t, look no father than the number of people accidentally overdosing DAILY. 

3. Age: America now has teenage heroin IV users. This was unheard of in 2002, when heroin was responded to with complete “fuck no” by most people and in disgust. This has changed wildly. A drug dealer doesn’t I’d. Liquor stores do. It’s way harder for a minor to get heroin than alcohol. 

4. Death: Most batches are cut and no one knows the dose. Most people that did oxy knew the dose when there wasn’t any fake going around.  

5. Counterproductive: Marijuana use was about 1% in the first half of the 20th century and hit 50% (used at least once) after scheduling. 

6. Fear and law are terrible deterrents: every addict has hit a new low only to use again. It’s complex. It’s a medical and societal issue. 

7. Tax : so we can wage more wars (sarcasm)

I can keep going on but Id love to hear others who have been through the depths of this hell and come out, especially the religious crowd. I believe in God myself pretty strongly but I think legalization might not be the worst idea. 

What do you think and why?",2

Ok so, as the title says, I'm going into rehab soon. This has been a long and painful journey but one that needs to end.
My addiction is currently to lope.
For those who don't know, lope is short for loperamide, which is an anti-diarrheal medication. Its often referred to as the ""poor mans methadone"".
I have currently been on it for for nearly 7 years now and am currently up to 184 2mg tablets every 2 days.
This has caused several health problems that I now have to deal with. Including me having to get a pacemaker/defibrillator implanted into my chest. I'm 31.

I have always wanted to get help for my addiction but several things prevented me from doing so. The main issue (the main concern I still have) is that no one will take my withdrawls seriously.

Now for a little backstory...
I recently lost my husband. He passed away very unexpectedly on july 24th of this year. He was only 34. His death was the worst of the many awful things we've endured this year (fuck 2020 amiright?).
He was also an addict(kinda) he was definitely addicted to opiates but he had a legitimate need for them and was prescribed them. He however, would also take the lope when he ran out of his pain meds.
His death was not addiction related (from what they could tell).
Right after he passed I become homeless. We were staying with his father at the time until we could save up the money to fix up a cabin on his father's property.

I feel I need to add that I suffer from many chronic illnesses. Because of this, I have never had my license. I also worked my very first job earlier this year. I'm 31.
I always had my husband to depend on for so much. I took care if our two kids and he took care of everything else. That's how he wanted it.

So, as soon as the doctors informed me that he would not make it, I knew I would have no where to live. His father is a terrible person. Without giving o out too many details, I'll just say that my husband was the only reason I didn't turn is father in for sexual harrassment.
So, with my husband gone, I am now broke, no license, no job and, no where to live. I have no family that cares about me apart from an aunt but she has no where for me to stay and only helps me because she knows its what my mom would have wanted.
I also recently found out, that the funeral home that held my husbands memorial is going to petition to become executor of my husbands estate (he had no will) because I haven't been able to pay the entirety of my bill. The purpose of them becoming executor is so they can liquidate any of my husbands assets to pay off the rest of the bill. The worst part is, the only asset my husband had was his truck, which is currently my home. I had made a go-fund-me to help with funeral costs but after they held the memorial, people assumed the bill was paid and stopped donating. I was pretty damned close too.
Not long after I learned my husband wasn't going to make it, I called SAMHSA. I was not sure what help I could get, all I knew was that I needed help. At the time, I told them my main addiction was to opiates. Which wasn't far from the truth. I've never been addicted to meth or things like that although I have had it.
The reason I told them opiates is also the reason for my post today.
I have always been given the strong impression that these types of places do not take loperamide addiction seriously. This is also something my husband used to tell me. He was once one of these people back before he began taking them himself who would say ""you tell them your on shit pills and they're going laugh at you"".

Back in early 2019 I was going to a suboxone clinic. This started after my husband and I attempted to self detox cold turkey for about 7 days. I'll elaborate more on that later. 
Anyways, when I told them I had been taking loperamide, the nurse first asked me why I thought that was an addiction that needed something like suboxone to ""cure"". She then repeatedly tried to tell the doctor ""she's only taking loperamide!"". They constantly downplayed it as something minimal and that I was ""crazy"" for putting my body at risk for something that ""doesn't do much if anything"" for opiate withdrawals. They also accused me of lying about taking so many saying ""that amount would have killed me"". 
Spoiler: it once almost did, And definitely will if I don't stop now.
Anyways, I was able to get them to give me the suboxone after I told them I was only taking loperamide when I didn't have pain pills.
The suboxone didn't help though. I absolutely hated it. It made my legs hurt so bad and I constantly felt like shit. 
I had finally gotten to where I only had to visit then clinic once every three weeks, when I discovered a lump on my cervix.
I was diagnosed with cervical and lymphatic cancers shortly after and had to quit suboxone once I found out I needed surgery.
I am happy to say though that after a total hysterectomy and a shit ton of radiation treatments, I am now cancer free. Atleast, I will be 100% sure after I get my final PET scan.

Anyways, back to why I'm here. I have been putting off going to treatment until I could get mine and my husbands affairs in order. I had to find a place to store our stuff and find a place for my for my cat to stay. I also had to wait on his death certificate so I could be put on as executor of his estate and get the truck put in my name. However, after weeks of dodging my questions I learned that the funeral home had been deliberately keeping his death certificate from me until I paid the bill. It didn't matter to them that I made a constant effort to pay them and that I have it all almost paid off. It has gotten to the point however where i can't keep putting off treatment. The anti-diarrhea meds are getting extremely hard to find in stores and I have no money to waste buying them online.
So, I have decided I am going this week. Either Wednesday or Thursday. I just wanted to spend some time with my daughters first.
I am getting increasingly afraid though, that they won't take me seriously.
I have gone through a few different types of withdrawls in the past but lope withdrawls are on a whole new level. When my husband and I went through them the week before I decided to go on suboxone. 
Its definitely not like other drugs. Most drug withdrawals can get better over time. Lope however just kept getting worse and worse. I felt worse than I had ever felt in my life. It plunged me into a deep depression and for the first time in many many years, I wanted to kill myself. It gave me extreme suicidal thoughts and i was having vivid dreams of my death. The only thing that helped me through it was my husband. Now he's not with me and I am afraid of what I might do If that happens again. Back when my husband was in the hospital I had to come home for two days. This was after they told me they pretty much knew he wouldn't make it. I had been so focused with staying by his side that I had been out of lope for about 3 days. Withdrawls had begun to kick in full force and all I could think about was ending my life. I was so ready to do it that I wrote my suicide letter, gathered up some important papers with my personal info on them for whoever would find my body. I made a plan to take take all of my husbands psychiatric medications and all of my meds and lay down and hopefully never wake up. I was ready to take them and then the phone rang. It was my youngest daughter (9) and she was worried about me. I talked to her for nearly two hours and decided not to do it just yet. 
The next day my husbands best friend dropped me off some lope. He said he knew I wouldn't be able to get to the store so he had ordered some for me. I took some and decided to hold off on ending my life.

Now I'm terrified that they won't take me seriously and won't help me. 
They've told me that I have to go to detox for 7-10 days before I can go into a residential treatment facility but everyone I have talked to at SAMHSA all say that they won't take me in if I've been clean for more than 3 days and I'm worried about them drug testing me because lope doesn't show up on standard drug tests. It has to be specifically tested for.
So, I am currently, nervously, counting down the days until I leave. I wanted to make this post to get others opinions and advice. I've never been to any type of inpatient treatment before. I'm also wondering if anyone has any opinions on whether or not they'll take me seriously. Its definitely got me nervous. I really need to go into an inpatient treatment center so I can get my life back on track and, so I can have a place to stay.
I have had many resource organizations trying to help me find a place to stay and they can't even find a shelter that will take me. The winter months are coming and I live in West Virginia, so living in a truck in the middle of winter is not a good idea. I was literally told by someone in my local homeless coalition that ""if you were a drug addict you'd get all kinds of help!"". Well surprise, surprise! I guess I'll be putting that to the test.
If anyone has any advice or opinions, I would love to hear them. Also, if any of you have been to an inpatient treatment facility I'd like to know what to expect. I know each place is different but I'd like to get a general idea of what I'm walking into. Any help right now will be greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Going into residential treatment soon for a loperamide addiction. I'm worried they won't take me seriously. Don't want to take suboxone or methadone.
I'm currently homeless with no money and can't drive. Just looking for advice or people's opinions. Would love to hear your treatment center stories and experiences so maybe I can get a feel for what to expect.",5

What would a supportive partner do in this situation? Why should I pretend that this isn't a thing that affects both of us? I know, I KNOW it is hard resisting temptation, especially when leftover pills just fall in your lap. I know it's regrettable and I know he is probably hurting deeply already. But it is terrifying from my point of view too. I love this man to absolute death and I cannot imagine losing any part of our relationship to opiates. I don't know what to do, or what to say, how to react in the best way. I'm just feeling such a confusing array of emotions and I fear I'm reacting poorly.",2

Started Norco about 11 years ago and about three years in went to what I thought was the magic cure - suboxone -   did not know it was a pill mill doctor and she put me on 32mg suboxone for a  10/325 10 pill a day Norco habit.   Yea my doctors are shocked as well bc wtf? 

Fast forward and I hit my own personal style of I can't do this anymore.  Was switching back and forth between Norco and suboxone throughout the years bc I could never get through the suboxone withdrawal no matter how low of a dose I got myself to they just wouldn't ever end. 

About two months ago I started a 1mg suboxone then three days Norco then 1 mg subxoke three day Norco then .5mg subxone three day Norco just to get that suboxone lowered in my system enough that it'd be shorter then eventually switched to Norco daily maybe about 10 a day bc I'm an addict and have no self control. 

15 days ago was my last Norco and I am in outpatient so I am in a program bc i wasnt craving the Norco just using it to stay out if withdrawal 

I am on Cymbalta, naltrexone, straterra, and gabapentin now.  

The physical stuff has mostly subsided minus the random flare up of chills that is like ""oh you though u was good? ha yea right here I am"" but then they to away so they come and go in waves.  

The insomnia is brutal making mentally each day harder so I am using trazadone which doesn't do anything but make my brain do like flips and then feel garbage in the morning.   

Side note-  I was taking benzos for a couple weeks due to a traumatic experience and am also thinking I have a small case if the benzo withdrawals so I am using etizolam tk taper as I cannot drop dirty fir benzos with my program and they will not prescribe any ti me to help with the crippling burning anxiety I feel in my chest.


I just took all my meds prescribed and am feeling OK right now.

My recovering homies and people who are here or been through this ---- why the heck can't I get myself out of bed.  

I hide out in my room basically all day.  Yea I get myself to go for a walk during the day but the thought of leaving my house for anything puts me into immediate terror.   No motivation to do anything.  Is this PAWS or is this an anxiety disorder? 

Please I am looking for advice from anyone whose felt this way of being scared to go back into the outside world.  All I want to do is be able to clean something or live a normal day.   I am on leave from work to deal with this so I don't have that structure of going to work that I am so used to and have NOOO idea what to do all day besides get a work out in, make my bed, and shower.   

This girl is calling all addicts

Still able to eat thanks to the meds and a very helpful SO who has made sure I have fluids and food. Starting to get a little energy but get light headed when I stand up to walk.

I posted here a few days ago about breaking up because I couldn't deal with the lies anymore... Since then I've stuck to my guns and stopped letting him act like we were getting back together any day.
He got so heartbroken. First day he was suicidal and I didn't get any sleep.
Second day a fake ass friend of mine took him drinking and when I called because I had a bad intuition, he was on his way to the dealer...

He told me horrible things and basically called me manipulative and an abuser (by text)... I know he didn't mean any of it but it was horrible. He said he was gonna mutilate his face or his fingers (he studies music so that would ruin his future for good). I asked one of his friends for help to manage this crisis and he just got angrier...

Since I couldn't sleep after that, I decided to write him an email asking him to distance himself from me. I explained again why I had to break up and how it was a long time coming as I gave him many chances and had told him several times in August that I was unhappy with our relationship. He said he understands. However I'm struggling just as much with the boundaries I set myself... 

But today was his birthday and so I came by his room to at least wish him a happy birthday and he was high. (It's weird how he never stopped me once from seeing him while high? He would lie to my face but not really hide?). Like really fucked up. It seems he has spiraled out of control since I re-established that we were broken up because he wasn't using everyday before that... He said it was the last time on his birthday... But he still doesn't seem to be able to cope with the sadness... I'm so scared that he just won't be able to make it and will go back to how he was 4 years ago, aka on the streets and without a goal in life... What could possibly help right now???? He at least gave me the 2 pills he had (some new thing I don't remember the name)... 

Seeing him like that is the worst. It destroys the good memories. It makes me wanna bump my head on the wall until I forget his existence. I thought only my parents could ever make me feel this bad but this is close to how I felt when I wanted my life to end.
I know that I can't be responsible for his actions but I can't stand watching him lose faith in life itself because I'm no longer around...",4

I've quit heroin (only used Imodium), after doing a half-assed ""taper"" (taking half the dose everyday, of what was my last bag).

I didn't do it completely right, because I felt sick during the first two days, but I feel it did something because by day 3 my nose is no longer runny and I've gone a few hours without any chills. I've also been able to sleep with the help of 2mg of Ativan.

For reference last time I w/d cold turkey it took me until day 3 at night to sleep properly and this time it happened at day 2, also used Ativan on both cases

I still take Imodium , but today might be the last day I do if my stomach is a bit better tomorrow.

However emotionally speaking today's been a trainwreck, started off good, then for no real reason I got very upset, guilty, and depressed. I haven't told anyone in my house I use, I live with my parents, just told them I was feeling sick yesterday (who hasn't).

I acknowledge I should tell them but I feel that the worst phase is over and once I feel completely o.k. physically speaking will I be able to deal with my emotions in a decent way.

I was advised to try Kratom but even if I buy some it won't be here before Tuesday, so I'll have to withdraw either way. I might try it after being clean though Im not sure how I feel about it, has anyone ever relapsed on heroin due to kratom?

Thanks everyone for providing an outlet for me to vent, thanks to my girlfriend who cannot see this but has been supporting me since day one, and everyone who's been bearing with these rants.

Hopefully they will stop once my brain can learn not to cry at the drop of a hat 😅",3

2020-10-08 19:07:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/j7nori/suboxone_detox_questions/,Suboxone Detox questions,Hi. I’ve been taking very small doses of subs for a couple months after doing a week long inpatient detox. The detox facility sent me home to quick and when I got home was still having a lot of discomfort. I already had a rx for subs. I was breaking them in tiny pieces and prob took about .5-1.5mg a day. I was running low and decided to taper even lower over a 4 day period. I’d take probably close to .25 or less once or 2x a day. The last 2 days was maybe even less. I’m now on day 3 of absolutely nothing. I’ve felt some uncomfortable body shivers and everything got super bright. I could also smell things more strongly. Today my stomach started hurting and I’ve been in the bathroom a lot after being constipated for a while. I’m hoping the wds don’t get to bad as I’ve read posts saying with suboxone you don’t start having bad withdrawal until day 3 or after. Is it possible because I tapered so low and never took more than 1.5 mg for only a couple months That I won’t have a bad withdrawal?  I’m praying this is this case because if it is I’m excited to be completely clean after almost 12 years of pain medications to treat 8 spinal cord surgeries. I don’t want to get really sick with wds and go to the hospital and start the cycle all over again. Thanks to anyone for your answers and comments.,11

I have had nothing but negative side effects with minimal improvement up until TODAY. I have only two strips left. I have been taking the drug every other day. One eight milligram strip every other day. Today I have taken mine maybe an hour ago. I was going to take another on Sunday (in two days) and my last one on Thursday (three days after that).

As far as sides related to Suboxone withdrawal shortly after detox... I left a detox center after three days months ago and felt the full effect of opiate withdrawal. Before that I had a crippling life threatening habit of a gram an a half a day snorting and I even started injecting for about a month. Going from dosing twice a day to one a day to every other day I felt mental changes but no noticeable physical symptoms.

What should I expect and what might I do with these two strips left? I have to go to jail for an extended period of a month or more and won't have the medicine... I will have to turn myself in soon (a week or two). I CAN get a refill but would rather not. Please give me some input as to what I might expect and how long it takes for severe symptoms to set it... if they ever do with this drug and how that might compare to heroin withdrawal.

Thanks,

Jonathan

I just received packs of Clonidine and Gabapentin through AllDayChemist and am going to give it everything I've got tomorrow since I have secured a week off of work. 

I have several questions:

1) What doses should I take regarding the Clonidine and Gabapentin?
2) Do these medications interact with eachother in any way?
3) Are there any other medications I should seek out? I do have Immodium, Klonopin and some Kratom (I'd rather not have to take the Kratom if possible)
4) Is there any estimate how long I will have to be on these medications? I have enough to last for about 2-3 weeks.
5) Any other advice you guys can offer me before going in?

Thank you all so much for your help. I am excited to get this shit kicked. These fent pills are insidious little things, I see how lives can be absolutely ruined because of them and the intense addiction that comes with them.

I was an addict for over 6 years...I’ve lied and stolen from people I love. I feel guilt all the time for it. My love with oxy began when I got all four of my wisdom teeth pulled. I had heard that drugs were bad before but no one ever really mentioned the sickness. So I took home my script of oxys being a young dumb 17 year old. I was a senior in high school, the worst I had ever done is smoke a little weed. 

So I took 30 oxycodone 5s  home and I popped one. Holy fuck!! When I tell you the euphoria I felt it was amazing. To my depressed teenage brain the feeling they gave me was like sex...but better. Warm, fuzzy and numb all over like nothing in the world could hurt me. So I thought hmm one was okay let me try two at once. Even better I thought while I popped two more. I abused my script and so the seed was planted.

I wasn’t initially addicted to oxy until I started working an overnight shift at a local coffee shop. I was on a weird sleep schedule so my decision making way off. My buddy....who I thought was a buddy was having someone drop off oxy for him.  I was so depressed and I just remembered how good it felt last time. I needed to feel something...or maybe nothing. Or both fuck. 

It was an oxy 30...and my oh my did I fall
in love. The energy and confidence it gave me was through the roof. I was the best me I could be. I felt like no one could mess with me. So the cycle began and I started buying oxy 10s ...then 15s...20s.... then once the opioid crisis began the only thing typically around are 30s. So I did those for years. 

At one point when I had a good job I was spending over 700 dollars a week on them just to not get sick. It’s a rough life for an addict.

Fast forward to now. I decided to get help after trying to quit so many times on my own. I swallow my disgusting addict false sense of pride and checked myself into detox. 

I pissed dirty for heroin even though I only did oxycodone. Fake pills are everywhere and they’ll look so good they’ll have you convinced theyre real. So seriously don’t be in denial. You’re probably doing heroin and you don’t know it. And if you are doing heroin I really hope you get the help you need. 

It’s day four and I have a long way to go but this is just the beginning. I pray for anyone going through the cycle and I hope you make it out before it’s too late...because eventually it’s gonna kill you.",2

So, I get a take home every other day . It isn't much **but**, it is big for me. 

Anyways, Friday I come in for my dose, get my take home for Saturday, and go home. 

Flash forward to Sunday...I get to the clinic to dose for the day and get me dose for Monday. I was generally dysphoric and sweaty. My monthly visitor was coming any day now and the weather has been up and down, so i blew both of those symptoms off.

I get to my clinic, get called for my dose and my bottle swap. The usual happens. I walk in. Tell them my ""numbers"" and show them my empty bottle before tossing it in the recycle bin. (we have to bring back bottles in order to get our next take home) Except as i'm pulling out my bottle from my lock box, I see that it is still full of methadone, seal still intact. I'm immediately confused thinking that I came a day early when I didn't need to. I immediately see the take date on the bottle and it is a day later than says on the bottle. I look at my nurse and tell her I must have forgotten to take my dose the day before. It immediately clicked why I wasn't feeling the best this morning.  I have a lot going on right now at home so I get distracted very easily . So, taking my methadone **COMPLETELY** slipped my mind. I have no idea how I forgot and vividly remembered my husband taking his, and forgot we had not dosed together. We usually dose together.

My nurse is very new and was very understanding, but had no idea what protocol was for something like this. The head nurse was not there but the next best thing was, my favorite nurse. She told the new nurse to give me my dose for today and my take home. They would ask the head nurse on Monday and let me know the outcome on Tuesday when I came back to dose.

The past two days I've been filled with anxiety wondering if I was gonna lose my take homes or not. I finally talked myself down. I logic with myself. 

""*Why would they take my take homes away? It's not like I didn't bring my bottle back. I brought my bottle back AND then some.""*

Now it's Tuesday and I have got to go to the clinic. I'm not nervous on the drive until I get in the shopping center where the clinic is located. I start thinking the worst is gonna happen. I get inside and give the receptionist my patient ID and wait to be called. I get called to the same new nurse that I got on Sunday. I do my usual. Give her my numbers and show her my empty bottle and toss it in the recycle bin. She starts dosing me as normal and I tell her how I now have an alarm set to take my methadone so I don't forget anymore. She then proceeds to tell me that that was wise. She informed me that since they went ahead and gave me a take home after i returned a dose that they can't take my take homes from me. She had warned me that if it happened again that I would lose my take home. I told her I understood and headed home.

but Honestly, I don't understand. I'm grateful but annoyed that I could have potentially lost my take home if the head nurse was there. I know I should learn my lesson and move on, but damn I feel like that is just so strict. I could have realized before going in the clinic and sold it, but it was turned in instead. I feel like they will find any excuse to take away a take home. I just feel like they like to punish you for the smallest thing but turn around and tell you to celebrate the smallest accomplishments. Why can't the understand the smallest of set backs?

Just really needed to vent because I do not have many people to talk about this with. Thanks for taking the time to read.

Ketamine helped a LOT","Feeling pretty fucking good. Last night I got out of my sauna and felt the most euphoric I've felt off drugs in YEARS. Was dancing around to music naked fuckin giggling and laughing my wife was like the fuck you're doing. Have been using somewhere between 120-240mg hydromorph a day or 800-1400mg morphine a day for about a year, before that was couple hundred mg oxy a day or like 5-600mg morph. Today not great had a 12 hour day at work and my RLS is really bad and driving me out my minds. Missed taking my gabaoentin as I got home when id already be staggering my doses for 3 hours. First 5 days were fucking nuts. Thank god for clonidine, 4g gabapentin in the evenings and immodium and xanax I even caught a bunch of sleep day to day shockingly. A couple nights of 3h sleep but even then, that's good compared to other kicks. Day 9 and I haven't craved any opiates since like the 48 hour mark. HOW IS THIS?!?!? 

WELL, I had a g of pharmaceutical ketamine ive stored away for a while. One morning after calling in sick to work on the morning of day 3 (missed 48 hours of work in the last week, oops there goes my sick time targets this year) I k holed myself with 300mg of IM ket and it was fucking eye opening. Once my ego returned my mind just went so deep and intro about my drug use and kids and my wife and job and how I need to turn my life around. That day my cravings were 100% gone. No interest in opi. PS NEVER K HOLE YOURSELF WITHOUT BEING LOADED ON IMMODIUM I literally almost shit 4 gallons of rrhea into my bed. As soon as I could move my body and got sensation I realized it was about to happen and sprinted face first into the fucking wall cause I was still so fucked up then made it to the toilet as it was coming out and just saved it. As well, the couple nights when sleep wasn't so great I went downstairs before my family woke up and bumped k and watched Midsommar (great movie) while hitting my vape and just hovered above k holing where you're all introspective and shit and further thought about my life and I gotta tell you, I am stunned at how amazing it worked at eliminating any desire for opiates again. It also seemed to super help my mood this whole time. I highly recommend trying ketamine to help with WD gloom as long as you got some other comfort meds around to make the physical portion a bit better so you don't shit yourself and wake up from the hole literally soaked in sweat and fluids.

I mean I was still SUPER fucking cold the whole time and lots of snot and sneezes and sore legs and nausea when the clons and gabs weren't active at those times but for real I think despite the ridiculous habit this was my most enjoyable kick yet lol. I want to keep it going........ too bad I already ordered 350 more dilly 8s on day 2 when I wanted to blow my brains out with cravings and they'll be here Wednesday fuck. I'm really gonna try to pawn them off somewhere as I can't afford to toss 2k cost down the toilet cause cravings hasn't been bad at all but now the ket is gone and cravings are really bad today. 

Anyways. Stopped taking xanax cause I once had a benzo problem, stopped my gabapentin took some trazodone to sleep but if I can't get to sleep ill an imovane and Ativan and hope that I can catch sleep cause I'm on nights tomorrow and I can't not sleep and be awaken48 hours",7

But to be honest, I’m still struggling during nights. I used opiates for over 10 years and masked pretty much any type of personal problem and now it’s just too overwhelming. 

I don’t want to complain much. I’m about to contact the Hazeldon Betty Ford clinic to start with help(shouldn’t I be looking for counseling instead). I guess I don’t know how to start and who to look up besides this. 

I’m in the Uppar Mid West and I really can’t handle another relapse. I made it 60 days before and it came out of nowhere. I was doing amazing but a tremendous amount was missing in my life. I had no structure. I had nothing meaningful going on. 

I want to use help this time. I hate night time. I do ok when people are around but when I’m alone with myself is when I struggle. I’m sure I’m not alone in this. 

I’ve never had this issue. But then again I’ve been on opiates/benzos(albeit maintenance/prescription) I was still on them. I ended up always occasionally abusing them and my dependence for depression moved into addiction like it always does. 

What herbs can I use to sleep just so I can keep my head tight. I’ve tried CBD, L-Theanine and even Gabapentin but to very little successs. I did quit benzos as well so the gastrointestinal side effects have been pretty bad at night and I just wanna get good deep sleep.",2

Idk if anyone will read this but idk who to talk to anymore... 

About a year and a half ago, I started dating this man who was kind of sober and kind of not. Basically was taking subs but would relapse often. He would always try to lie about it but always ended up telling the truth. I almost broke up with him many times during the first months because it felt like too much to handle. First time it happened he said he would go back to take more drugs and commit suicide. We were on a break for a while but still got back together... And for a while it seemed like all of that was in the past.

I do not have any addictions. I have anxiety issues but I've worked on my mental health a lot and am now in a way better place than a few years ago. But it clearly isn't the case for him.

He doesn't know how to deal with stress, doesn't know how to cry, has ADHD and has tremendous issues due to him being raped as a child and losing his mom at an early age.

He's not a bad person but of course, addiction makes him do stupid stuff. He lies about his relapses. On the other hand he's the only person I've ever truly loved and can be the most adorable person ever. All my friends and family love him so much as well... 

Two weeks ago it all came to a boiling point : he had been acting weird for a while and had told me he took more painkillers than necessary when he was in pain last month (at first didn't admit to that but he said that was the final truth (!,!,!) ), and then told me he messed up again after trying to tell another lie, and I was like okay I'm done I can't be with you if you lie all the time and I can't save you, you have to do the work and stop thinking I can be your reason to live. I also had realized at that point that I was codependent. 

That's when he admitted to taking heroin numerous times unbeknownst to me. So he had been lying about it for months at this point. And had made up the painkillers thing.
It broke me. I was so sure he was almost a year sober from heroin.
We live in the same building (kitchen and bathroom in common) and go to the same school. He moved in like a month ago....

So for a few days he was still on heroin but during the past 2 weeks he was nothing but nice to me. And was taking his suboxon treatment seriously. However he refuses to accept that it's over between us and acts like we will get back together any second now. It's that or death according to him. And it's SO TEMPTING to just give in because I still love him so much, you know? 

Except today he got drunk bcs he couldn't say no to someone and when I called him he was on his way to the dealer, for cocaïne he said. I've told him numerous times that he abuses any drug when given the opportunity and can't afford to drink or smoke anything at the moment but 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

I'm like positive he might commit suicide or at least ruin everything he has built for himself for the past 2 years if I really cut him off. But I know I can't be with him. And I don't think he will get it until I really disappear from his life.
I still love him so so much. I wanna believe that everything can be fixed and I always end up thinking that I should give him another chance.

I guess I'm posting here because I want some advice or at least to feel less alone...

I used to feel like I didn’t have enough time in a day, now I feel like there is TOO MUCH time. I don’t know if it’s the pandemic but Like the day drags on FOREVER. My use wasn’t/ isnt crazy I know I’m not dependent anymore because I don’t get withdrawals and if I do maybe some chills but that’s it. I can sleep and eat and go to work and even be happy in some times of the day. I know I’m an addict though because even though I’m not hurting, it’s all I want and all I think about. Even though after the fact of using I feel so ashamed. Anyways I guess I’m just rambling but fuck days just feel too long most of the time.

Mental health problems screw you up for life, guys. Go to your doctor. Get diagnosed. Get meds if you need them. Get therapy if you need them.

A lot of people I was in rehab with have relapsed and returned to rehab or haven't. I refuse to be a negative percentage on the success rate of my program. This month was a good month. I'm building a house by myself which has become my beacon of hope, I'm literally and figuratively rebuilding my life everyday.  8 FUCKING MONTHS that is the longest stretch I've been clean in the past 5 years, including 6 months in jail lol.

Right now I’m laying here in bed so proud of my 4 hours of solid sleep. Fell asleep around midnight and didn’t even wake up once till 4:30am. I consider that a win compared to the last couple nights. Way less chills tonight, but still sweating profusely 😂 

I read another poster on here saying someone told them to “accept” the withdrawal, as your body is slowly going back to normal. That’s my mindset right now and I think it’s really helping. The other day I sat down and really thought about all the negative things my addiction has caused. Broke down crying after 30 minutes sitting there, the regrets washing over me. You all know those thoughts... “what have I done to myself?” and “I could have been in a lot better situation now if I hadn’t started”. And my emotions are returning in waves - completely washing over me. But hey - that’s a step in the positive direction right? :)

I’ve also been seeking an outlet to let out some of this built of energy/emotions. It comes in bursts, so I’m thinking next time maybe take advantage of it and go for a run or something. But I digress...

Whats really helped me personally, is just EVERY SINGLE TIME even the thought of dosing creeps up, I immediately stop. I stop and remember. All the opportunities that I’ve missed, the relationships I’ve destroyed. And all for what? A few hours of high. 

So my advice for the day: just remember. Remember who you were before you entered this dark phase. This drug doesn’t define us. We are more than this addiction, this deadly habit. We are whole people with interests and hobbies. It’s just that we’ve lost sight of it. So I just want you to remember who you were before this. And I want you to BELIEVE that you still are that person. We’re all here for each other. Each post, each comment on here is helping SOMEONE inch closer and closer to being free.

I've never felt suicidal. I wouldn't say I feel that way now. It gives me hope to hear that people say you do eventually feel ""normal"" again. That your brain chemistry can even itself out again and I really do believe that the recovery community is always there and will welcome you back no matter how many times you leave and come back. It's just that every time I kick even after acute symptoms I just don't feel normal. They say that you lose interest in old hobbies and shit like that when you're an addict but I feel the opposite. That when I'm sober I don't want to do the things I like. Sober I feel messed up but using I hesitate to even say I get high it's more like I feel normal again. Even after i get past WDs then go back and pick up it feels more normal.

Sorry for ranting. Pretty much I am jealous that some of my best friends are gone and I think how I'm jealous that they don't struggle with the cycle anymore. I don't want to die but being sober doesn't feel great either. 

I've read a lot of recovery posts and like I said, they give me hope that you do feel better again but sometimes I just feel like the only reason I haven't just done as much dope as I can and drift away is cause I know my parents would be sad.

The rest is miserable. 

I have always loved thrills which got me into using but fuck that life. 

What do you all do for the rest of your lives?

Sitting in a room and pouring my guts may be my thing once in a blue moon but that’s just not me long term. 

I’ve heard of a group that even ex president G W Bush is even part of that does extreme exercise to overcome addiction(please no political comments). 

I need something. I need a lifelong thing. I will relapse otherwise. 

I would love to hear success stories of what you guys can do. The guilt thing of focusing on your wife and kid just doesn’t cut it. This demon is powerful. 

I literally feel like I’m over taken by another spirit when I rationalize. Minutes later I’m thinking “Wtf was that. You would have used. Now you’re back to hating it.”  

I don’t understand this. 

I dream about it. 

I relapsed after 60 days and now I’m 16 days clean but I feel the mental part approaching. 

All I can think of is, will this be for the rest of my life? 

How on earth will I overcome this?

“Maybe I should just go back on methadone for life! I found my wife while on it. I made six figures/year while on it. Bought my first house and climbed the corporate ladder on it. Family and friends were all around me on it.  I had a German car while on it. I was physically and mentally my best on it. Everyone loved me when I was on it. Maybe that’s the answer” all true as well. Is occasionally abuse the methadone but I almost always took it as prescribed. I only switched to subs because I had to travel and they wouldn’t give me take outs because they didn’t believe me when my car got broken into and my takeouts got stolen(true story). I was on subs for 3 years but went back on methadone. It was better for the depression during winters. I always tend to relapse in Minnesota winters. I hate it. I wasn’t born here. The people are cold. 

Then 15 minutes later, I’m like wtf!! What were you thinking! You couldn’t have a kid and 6 months later after quitting methadone, your wife got pregnant. You were overweight. Always tired. Complacent. Why would you want that. 

People can’t even hold a food diet their whole life and they judge us when our brains have been rewired chemically and takes years apparently to heal. 

One hour I’m championing others into recovery and the next I remember how great my life was on methadone(unfortunately I did climb my career, find my wife, first house all while on maintenance)

I just can’t handle the withdrawals coming off methadone again. Then I rationalize by saying. “Be on it for life!  But what if there’s a war. What if there’s a calamity. But dude that’s never gonna happen. What if? Nah dude. But what about if you have an accident? Or on your deathbed. How will you handle it then

Start loathing whatever drug made you feel this. 

Focus all your anger, pain, disappointment and loathing on that substance. 

Make it your enemy. 

Embrace the pain and fight it. 

You are stronger. You are alive. You will make it. 

Throw all the drugs away. It does miracles and actually makes the withdrawal much easier. 

Embrace it. Don’t be ashamed. Don’t blame yourself. Don’t have spiraling negative thoughts. This isn’t the time for that!

It’s time for that inner fighter to say “F*** you I will best you and I will have a wonderful life and never visit you again, EVER’

But today I really feel like I’m past the worst stuff cuz I feel much better! I still have no energy or appetite at all but that’s nothing compared to the chills and RLS of the past few days. 

Whomever is reading this that needs to kick opiates but is scared, I’m here to tell you that you can do it. Yes it will suck balls but you can do it. I found it easier when I made myself get mad at and hate the dope. Screw that shit, never again! I had my wife here with me kicking at the same time, so I would recommend not being alone if that’s possible. I imagine if I would’ve been alone it would’ve been worse mentally.

I tried to take the initiative to do the right thing, and transferred myself into an all-encompassing ""transitional living"" (Free housing) program, with psych, therapy, and IOP. Turns out the place was just full of washed out hookers, active users, and schizophrenic or otherwise mentally unstable people. Also there was a giant COVID outbreak there and I saw the cops, paramedics, firefighters, lab coats, and drug use all by 9:00 in the morning.  On quarantine, couldn't go to meetings, stuck with a bunch of street urchins more or less, and maybe a few decent people that might succeed at recovery if given a chance. Needless to say, this suburban mama's boy decided it wasn't the place for him.

My concern is this....

I've been through the ringer with rehabs and detoxes.  I'm far more privileged than most, coming from the suburbs, with both of my separated parents making a decent living, although I don't benefit from their money really, other than living in their basement on and off for years, and having good healthcare up until I turned 26.  

I'm worried I just can't stop this charade... lying to myself and others... deceiving my own mind - perhaps I found that place intolerable and left in order to be able to use heroin again.  I recall the feeling after graduating 30 day programs full of uncontrollable anxiety, nausea, and excitement, knowing I'm hours, days, or weeks from getting high again.  No matter how successful I portray myself to be in recovery, I am almost always planning a relapse in the back of my mind. I guess they call that a reservation... however, mine is more like a guarantee. I know as addicts, we have done much crazier things than just plan on a relapse.

Even as I sit here, 7 days off dope, and 3 days off Subutex (they gave me a 3 day taper in detox, which I felt was not nearly enough), I am trying to get my dealer to deliver a gram across town, and the anxiety, stomach ache, and withdrawal (PAWS?) symptoms are becoming unbearable.

Since I've gotten out of that awful housing spot, it's like the withdrawals amplified tenfold, because my body and mind KNOW I can cop dope, if I decide to... fuck it.  At least I'll have another night of bliss if he shows up, and I can deal with life again tomorrow.

It's almost as if I am incapable of living without this shit.

&#x200B;

Can anyone relate? Advice? I'm just looking for someone to lend an ear really. Thanks fam...

I had almost 4 years with no opiates inside of me whatsoever. I got to a point where I wasn't taking care of my emotional and spiritual needs. I just felt like that part of my life was ""over"". Needed surgery, accepted painkillers, you know..

I used heroin pretty briefly afterwards. Maybe 2 months max, moderate to light usage. Then I made the mother of all mistakes and I got on suboxone instead of just going to detox, treatment, and actually re-approaching recovery. What I know works for me. I wasn't ready to accept the reality of the situation yet.

Suboxone has taken me for a ride this year. At 5 or 6 months I tried quitting after tapering down to .5mg which I went a good 8 days into detoxing and was pretty much thru any serious acute symptoms, with lingering discomfort of course. However, once again I was still failing to see the truth of the situation. I thought subs were my problem, but of course anyone with some good recovery will tell you they were my solution. A realization I've had far too many times smacks me in the face again. I need recovery. I need the community, the love, the vulnerability, the acceptance, and all of those wonderful things that come along with a recovery community. Anyways, I fell back on subs after 8 days. 

Went to treatment for a month a few months back, tapered to .5mg again at treatment. I was scared as all hell to jump there, but was going to, until I had to leave because of covid stuff. 

Leave treatment, end up back on a high dose. 4 - 6mg for a few weeks then quick tapered to ~.5mg.
Roughly ten months of bouncing up and down in doses trying to get off because it was harming me, not helping me.

I can't do it with the subs. I used to be able to ride out the misery of the H detox, then stay sober for months and months on sheer will before I 'started my spiritual journey'. This is impossible now because of suboxone. I have constant access making it difficult to leave alone. I just couldn't get the fuck away from it for some reason.

So I did something that may sound absolutely crazy, and it is crazy. I have to believe it will pay off though.  

I got myself to a low dose, stopped taking them, 
waited for the withdrawals to set in around 35 hours, and began using heroin. I used BTH over the course of 2 weeks. Days 4-12 of the switch I could feel the bupe WD breaking thru my scheduled shots ranging from 120 mg - 60mg. Then it seemed to subside for the last couple days and my shots were keeping me right long enough to do the last one at 6 pm and not wake up in WD.

Small amount of tapering with the H, boom. 

I'm now on day 4 since my last dose. Unfortunately I caved at 27 hrs and took .5mg of sub and at like 45 hours I took .25mg of sub. I don't know how much they affected me. Didn't seem to help much.

I know how reckless and crazy it sounds, but I KNOW i can detox from heroin. I can not fucking do it with suboxone. I have no desire to use more heroin. It sucks, it's street dope, which means fent, which means it's not the drug I fell in love with anymore. Might look and smell the same, but something is different. I guess I'm different too. I digress.

I want recovery. I want to stop isolating myself. I want to feel that flow of life again. I want to do the next right thing again. 

In the past, in recovery, when I really gave it all up to Source, I could see the magic happening right in front of my eyes. 

I try to remind myself I am just around the corner from waking up and feeling better. I am only 26 years old. I have so much time to live. Just gotta do what I gotta do right now and be OKAY with where I am. 

I'm trying to keep my eyes open to the truth. That part of me that wants to keep me down, the part that thrives on comfort and desire, while simultaneously barraging me with negative self talk. That part that wants to fucking kill me.. that is not the truth. It isn't real. Love and connection will save me.

I'm rambling now. My mind is getting clearer, my feelings feel like feelings, the light outside seems brighter, BUT it is only day 4 of this (hopefully full agonist detox, not some half sub half fentadope detox) shit. I know I can't expect to be working out for 2 hours, or doing full yoga routine, or eating 3 full healthy meals.. etc but I have to belive I'm getting better. It seems like night one (28 hr in) was the worst with the rls and anxiety, and the next 2 nights got slightly easier each night. I'm considering going and buying a stupidly expensive Theragun to use for the next couple of weeks then returning it. Seems like a game changer. I don't know. I just want to get through this.

I have been staggering 300 mg gabapentin throughout the day, trying to keep them to a minimum or at least less each day. I've been taking like 50+ grams of vit-C as sodium ascorbate. Last night I was given .75 mg alprazolam. I have been smoking too much good flower (I'm an admitted thc addict too, but I have to deal with that later). Multivitamin, Bacopa, Microalgae pills for omegas, massive fruit smoothies, as much water as I can get in me. Avoiding coffee (outside of a slapsh with each gaba to assist bioavailability). 

You all know. It's up and down. 

I have snapchat memories popping up from these days 1 year ago. At the hospital. I'm wrapping this up exactly 1 year after it started. I fucking GOT this. I have to. I miss the person I know I am, but am so disconnected from. 

I'm tired of living as a manifestation of my trauma and my pain. I am more than that. 

I don't even really know what my purpose is for posting this anymore. If you have any advice, words of encouragement, if my situation sounds like yours and you have any words of wisdom I love to learn. 

I guess the post just became my journal. I should go get my journal and do that..

TL;DR : 10 months stuck on subs, used H to come off. Currently in it. Yea, I know.",1

This weekend I’m supposed to go to a haunted house thing with my wife and friends and apparently it’s expensive and she already bought the tickets so I can’t quit now. Work has been extremely busy so I can’t just do nothing at work while I withdraw. 

I wish I could just stop everything for just 1 week while I get over the worst of it. I’ve put my wife through my WDs too many times now and I just always go back. I don’t know how much more she can take. Ugh I hate myself 

I’ve been taking 200mg tramadol for 10 years now for a chronic pain condition. I run out weeks early every month. I really want to stop but it’s so fucking hard.",2
