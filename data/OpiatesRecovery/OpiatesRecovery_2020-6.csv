Please remember that people are coming here looking for help. Think about all the times when you were using and you were desperate. But you had no idea where to start or what to do. 

I know what you're thinking: ""Well, if someone had just warned me how stupid that was and I quit while I was only taking 6 Norcos a day my life would be so much better."" 

Come on. We all know no one could have told you anything. And certainly not a stranger on the internet. **Don't sit on a high horse like you would have ever listened to the advice you're giving when you were using.** 

I'm not saying not to say it at all. But be cognizant of the fact that someone that is struggling with an opiate addiction is reaching out, and by making a blanket statement that amounts to basically insulting them, you're only making it that much worse. And you're acting like you're better than them, whether you like it or not, when really you started in the same place. So fuck off with that. 

The end result, whether you want to admit it or not, is that less people seek help. If someone asks how to taper their hydrocodone habit or if they can cold water extract it, don't jump in and tell them they need to stop right now and that's nothing and they're stupid. Again, picture yourself in their shoes. They're going to reject your ""help"". 

I know what you're thinking again: ""But they will get help when they're ready and only when they're ready. Then we'll be there to support that. I'm not an enabler.""

**People that are rejected when looking for advice about how to be safe might die. People that want help, but find it offputting, might die trying to find something that does work, because no one is giving them that information.**

I'm not willing to be part of that. If you don't have something constructive to offer, don't fucking comment. I'm not saying not to challenge OP or to share your own experience. 

Someone posting in a recovery forum clearly knows they have a problem. Maybe they're not ready to quit, but they need to know they'll be supported when they do. **Rejecting people because they're using only leads to them using more to forget you did that shit to them. This is an online forum, you don't need boundaries like you need in real life. Just don't fucking participate then.**

I am asking because I see *myself* in so many of the users I've seen rejected here. I reached out multiple times and got a bunch of very similar bullshit answers. It took me years to figure out that I would have to take the bull by the horns and figure out a program that worked for me outside of a traditional program. 

The truth is that traditional programs (especially 12-step) don't work for most people. It's just overrepresented because there isn't much else out there unless you have access to excellent private medical insurance and/or large amounts of cash. 

That's a political conversation for another time, but I feel like a lot of times addicts are so off-put by the prolific 12-step stuff that they're afraid to ask for help. I know because that's how I felt. I gave it a chance, and I AMA. 

There are plenty of posts I don't comment on because I don't have anything useful to offer. I would never, ever jump on someone celebrating a year with no substances and brag that I don't use opiates anymore but smoke weed a few nights a week. So please respect that and don't jump down someone's throat on another post asking about smoking weed. It's fine to say you don't use it and explain why, so long as you stay respectful. 

TL;DR: Respect each other.

EDIT: I am 1 day + 17.5 hours sober and I am staying motivated. i slept well last night, thanks to a piece of promethazine & .25 mg of klonopin. woke up around 8 am with my bed soaking wet and cut up a tiny sliver of suboxone (maybe .5 mg) and that seemed to help tremendously. it’s now 10:15 am and i’m drinking coffee and about to get in the shower for the day. night and day difference in how i felt yesterday without the sub - my eyes were runny, nose runny, shivering but sweating and my entire body hurt. this detox was different than my former ones though bc i slept pretty much ALL day and ALL night when before i couldn’t sleep for days. weird but i’m not mad.. lol. going to continue to take these subs in very small amount for the next few days until my symptoms of w/d are gone (the physical ones atleast- i know i’m in for the long run on the mental aspect). today i have zero symptoms other than my body feels like it got hit by a train and all my muscles are aching, but that’s manageable. also started my period yesterday, so that’s not helping. such a bitch. anyways- one day at a time and i’m staying sober today bc i choose to.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40646166}"

It would take a lot of time and words to fully express how much this means to me, so for now ill keep it short. 9 months ago i was living in complete and utter misery. i was suffering, all day every day. i was in agony, both physically and emotionally. and above all i was so, so scared.

One where I don’t have to run to use drugs whenever I feel emotion because I’m desperate to be numb. One where I can exist in the present moment and enjoy things for what they are instead of having my mind fervently obsess over when my next fix will be. In my new reality, I am no longer haunted by the monster of cravings looming over me 24/7 and trying to drag me back down into despair. Thoughts of using still come, yes, but they are rare and fleeting. They don’t hold the power over me they once did, because I know now that I am stronger than them.

I started with percocets once or twice a month in the summer of 2018. I had college off and I was dicking around. Once school started I never touched them, so that’s 8 months sober. 

2019 summer, in the beginning Mayish I was doing percocets but I’d say 6 times totally that month (guessing). The following months I started doing 40MG of Oxy and as the months went by my habit picked up to everyday. I had sober weeks here and there throughout summer but I’d say I used 50-75% of the remaining days throughout summer. School once again started and I was going through some mild withdrawals. I’d visit home every 3 weeks or so and do it FRI, SAT, SUN. And head back to school. Managed to make it through the school year and get through withdrawals as well as break down my habit. 

Now, 2020 school got cancelled cuz of covid and I was back home. I started the habit again in March around the same dose 40MG I’ve had a week or two sober in between this habit but pretty much everyday. Some days I’ve done 80MG but rarely I’d say. I’ve also had days sober here and there. I’m trying to quit permanently as I’m fortunate enough to be in school, doing well in life and have time. I don’t want to be stuck in this cycle and ruin my life. 

I was simply wondering how you guys think I should go about quitting and how bad my withdrawals should be. I’m really worried and just never want to do this drug again.

EDIT: 
I’m also scared of the effect it’s had on my mental cognition. I am a math student so I need to be as sharp as possible to handle the school work. Really don’t want to be permanently slower or impaired. On top of that, I’m worried about the depressive state withdrawals gets you into and whether I’ll ever be naturally happy again.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54252124}"
2020-06-29 00:47:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hhtiz2/two_months_clean_from_fentanyl/,Two months clean from Fentanyl,"I thought I'd share my story for anyone else that's struggling with Fentanyl/drug addiction, so here it goes:

Around November of last year, I started taking Fentanyl because it helped me feel motivated and more interested in my work.  It definitely helped and I kicked ass at my job for the ten months I was using.  I decided it was time to try and quit when I was snorting 3-4 pills per day and terrified to fall asleep at night because it felt like I wouldn't wake up.  A last shipment of $1000 worth of pills came in and I flushed all of it down the toilet.

Life was pretty good.  I lived in Arizona, had a great relationship that was going on 4+ years, had an awesome job, house...everything.  I now have none of that because of Fentanyl.

The first couple of weeks of withdrawals sucked of course, and I dealt with it by taking Suboxone and a ton of Xanax which causes permanent memory loss for me, so I really don't remember a lot.  But honestly, life didn't start to suck until after I got sober.

When I started to get sober I felt bad about neglecting all my friends and family for the past year or so and made a post on Facebook telling everyone what was going on and apologizing to everyone, which resulted in a ton of supporting comments and people reaching out.

Except for my girlfriend's family...they started treating me like a criminal.  This is when shit got hard.

At around week three of withdrawals, my girlfriend asked me to temporarily leave the house and I'm not one for fighting or causing conflict, so I booked an Airbnb for a couple of weeks, packed a bag, and left.

I was so fucking stressed out that I got insomnia and didn't sleep for eight days.  During this eight days I Uber'd back and forth to hospitals and lost grip of reality.  I could no longer tell the difference between my dreams (that I somehow had while awake) and what was real.  This eventually resulted in me going into a state of psychosis and waking up in a hospital.

I do remember some of what happened in my ""psychosis"" episode though...I woke up in my bed and had two voices in my head telling me what to do.  I have a lot of social anxiety so there's no way in hell I'd do any of this normally, but they had me running around in public asking people for a ride to the airport, walking over cactus, jumping over walls and eventually into a pool filled with people, scaring the shit out of everyone.  That's when the ambulance picked me up and I became unconscious.

I woke up a couple of days later to nurses telling me I'm going to be discharged and I'm to jump on a plane back home, across the country.  Apparently, while unconscious my girlfriend packed all of my shit and booked a ticket for me to fly home the next day.

I ended up getting discharged early, so she picked me up and brought me home.  All of my things were in boxes, suitcases packed...the works.  I was still confused as fuck from waking up in the hospital so I didn't really fuss about it, plus at this point, I was a month sober so I didn't really understand why I had to leave.

We slept together that night and the next morning I said I don't want to get on a plane, and she flipped her shit.  I canceled my flight, she screamed at me and punched a door, then packed a bag of clothes and left with her mom.  We shared a bank account that she drained so I just stayed at the house for the next 48 hours wondering what the hell I did that was so wrong.

After two days of staying in my house that I paid for with all of my shit in it, a couple of cops knocked on my door and presented me with a restraining order and told me I have 10 minutes to pack my things and leave.

The only way I could legally get kicked out was by filing a false police report, which is exactly what happened.  The court order states that I pushed her into a wall and slammed a door in her face which is total bullshit, but whatever.  She took all my money so I couldn't afford to rent a U-HAUL to get my things, so all I could do at this point was drive across the country and live with my parents again.

If I never made that Facebook post, I think none of that would have ever happened.  Though at the same time I'm sort of glad it did because I could never just abandon someone I love and completely take their life away like that, and I don't want to be with someone who can.  I still don't know what the fuck I did to deserve any of it, but I'm looking up.  My car got repoed two days ago and all I can do is laugh about it.

Going through withdrawals, insomnia, hospitals, and losing everything in such a short amount of time is by far the hardest thing I have ever gone through and I'm a stronger person because of it.  I'm not really scared of anything anymore.

I started chipping and we all know how that goes. It didn’t take me very long to start using daily again. I had a pretty big binge for about a week before I had an OD scare (I ended up being fine, but the experience still rattled me). 

I realized that I can’t be a functioning human and on fent at the same time. The windows I didn’t have any pills left I was practically a bedridden husk of myself. I missed being healthy and energized. So I’m trying again. 

Since I didn’t use too long, my withdrawals were manageable. I used kratom for the first 3 days then stopped. Just taking vitamins and enjoying the sunshine. I’m going through a breakup as well which has been really brutal on me...but I realize drugs don’t really take the emotional pain away.

I stumbled upon this thread recently and I just wanted to thank everyone because it’s really helped us to read your stories and know that other people can relate, have overcome this, and are living better lives. We hadn’t admitted to ourselves that we were dependent on opana until our supply ran dry and withdrawal hit so hard. But I’m thankful it happened. The physical symptoms are pretty much behind us, except the low energy and brain cloudiness. I’m hopeful to steer my life back in the right direction. 

A question for other couples that have gotten hooked. I’m the one who knew the guy and started getting them, when she hadn’t ever tried them before. I feel so guilty about getting us into this, do you? I do feel like it might give me more strength to say no when cravings come up, because I want more than anything to get us out of this.

Long story short I'm more of a benzo and kratom addict. I wasn't thinking rationally while quitting and I got some oxy, and of course I overdosed. I slept a whole day and can't remember shit, but I was having seizures, up until June 5th when I had a grand mal seizure for 12 minutes. I seized so hard my arm dislocated. It was terrible but anyway, that's not exactly why I'm posting.

The hospital prescribed 15-20mg of oxycodone since June 5th after getting a liver biopsy and a closed reduction surgery. They also gave me fent which led to a psychosis. It was severe and I had Ativan because of this (,only once and I understand the dangers of mixing opiates and benzos but really I couldn't move and I was in tubes). I stopped cold turkey a couple days ago. I'm having severe headaches today and my head never hurts. I also have crazy sweats which is reminiscent of kratom Withdrawal.

I just took a rescue dose of 2.5mg and feel somewhat better physically but I only have a few pills left and that gives me anxiety. I feel really gross though, almost overdosed. I might have a weed hangover too but it helps my seizures. I also take 2 grams of Keppra daily since June 5. I'm new to the meds but it feels like a really high dose.

Anyway, is it safe to take a couple grams of kratom with small oxy doses like 2.5mg? If so, can you help me with what to say to my parents so they let me take kratom? Maybe a movie? I'm in a sling so my mom literally feeds me oxy as prescribed, and I guess she's tapering me. They say I act different on kratom, but really it's the benzos. I was in rehab last year for benzos, and I ""relapsed"" on kratom but it wasn't tested for and I was fine. Even the respected but strict af doctor said my eyes were finally glowing after a month or so. Also, the oxy makes me act weird either way. I don't really know myself at all though. 

I'm trying to suck up the pain but I can only sit up for a little while so that's why I even mention kratom.

I've been high for 5 years and I've lost everything and almost died.

I might have a shot at getting sober soon.

Folks, half rant half looking for advice. Does anyone have any tips for coping with insomnia? I’m day 15 of cold turkey after a year of trying to taper off codeine. I took codeine everyday for about 2 years. Not huge amounts but enough to get nicely buzzed. First week wasn’t too bad physically. Upset stomach etc. Second week, insomnia is killing me. RLS doesn’t help but they seem to be improving, marginally, each day. 

My biggest problem is I just cant fall asleep. I have 2 kids to look after and a full time job and the lack of sleep is almost unbearable. Without sleep I’ve constantly got a headache, v low mood, absolutely no motivation to do anything and a deep sense of apathy. The insomnia also sometimes triggers my PTSD which leaves me in a highly stressed and aggravated state that takes me hours, sometimes days to break. I can’t open the door on Benzo’s as frankly I don’t have the self control to take them as needed. I take passionflower, hops, valerian, HTP and also mirtazipine but tbh they do fuck all. I’m also a recovering alcoholic so a nip before bed is out of the question. 

My GP won’t write me a script for any more hypnotics (had 7 sleeping tabs a week ago to get me over the hump) as they don’t want me getting addicted to them. I understand their stance but I don’t think they’re fully considering the balance between relapse and new addiction. I dunno, maybe they are but my experience of the GP’s is that they know very little about addiction other than a detox graph they can pull up on their PC. I don’t meet the cut off for MAT. 

In a way, I’m looking for that silver bullet which deep down I think is simply time and sobriety. However, I’m desperate and would be interested to hear and learn from your experiences. Thanks and good luck to everyone on their journey.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8028749}"
2020-06-27 02:52:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hgorii/that_feeling_when_repost_from_ropiates/,That feeling when... (Repost from r/opiates),"You've been sick for days. Dry heaving when you brush your teeth in the morning. Muscles ache, bones throb, nerves on fire, limbs kicking; the pain and restlessness seem unreal. If lucky, you're sleeping for 15 minutes at a time in a drenched bed sheet that isn't going to get washed anytime soon.  You wake up from your 3rd wet dream of the week, only to be bombarded with instant anxiety and the realization that your in hell on earth. Time moves so slow. Nothing is interesting. Even watching YouTube feels like a chore. Conversations feel so awkward, and all you want to be is alone, yet you crave attachment. Most likely you haven't had a gf/bf for an embarrassing amount of time. Nothing matters. Life seems dull and grey. And the only remedy is what got you here in the first place.  

You somehow power through the days. Physically you feel a little better, but mentally still falling in an abyss. When will you reach the ocean floor? Your missed calls/texts are adding up, yet still no desire to enter back in reality. You tell loved ones you have the flu... The 4th time this year. They know whats up. But you don't have the energy to come clean and validate their disappointment.  But you keep pushing through. You lay in bed, catching yourself praying to a God that you don't even believe in. You are so close to relapse because there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. Life seems so dark. Will you ever feel normal again? 

You wake up to the birds chirping, glance at your phone, and surprised it's 7am. You finally take a dump that has an actual shape. Somehow you're able to eat a bowl of cereal. You hop in the shower and stand the entire time, instead of periodically sitting like a school kid as the water temporary cleanses your soul like a baptism.  As you're drying off, the shivering shakes aren't as prevalent. You find the energy to go to the store. When you approach the cashier, you make friendly eye contact and surprisingly it doesn't feel like she stared through your soul. The small talk doesn't seem as forced and your brain reacts a little faster. Possibly even make a corny joke that gets a smile. As you walk back to your car, you notice you're walking a little faster. Muscles aren't aching as bad. Lower back not tied in a knot. The sky looks bluer and the trees a little greener. The gentle breeze dries the sweat off your back, and for once you're content with your body temperature. 

THAT FEELING WHEN the sun shines down on your pale face.. You look up and smile for the first time in a week+. You begin to float up from the ocean floor; equilibrium is in motion, and that radiant light at the end of the tunnel is now visible. The hard part is over, yet deep down you know it has just begun. But for the time being you have hope. That smile on your face is worth more than money can buy and perhaps your bank account has seen the last of overdraft days. As you drive down the road, with windows down, a nostalgic song comes on the radio, and it's like you've heard music for the first time..

That feeling when you are finally recovering from opiate withdrawal..

I'm a former oxy and pressed pill daily user. Got up to 20 pressed pills per day at my worst. Finally jumped on suboxone in September 2018 and jumped off that in June of last year.

These days, I can't say I'm feeling great, but no longer having to depend on opiates has been the most freeing experience I've ever had. No more sickness. No more worrying about running out or getting my supply. No having to hide anything from friends and coworkers. The constant anxiety is gone. I'm off the roller coaster. Life is just normal again.

The downside is my depression and fatigue haven't lifted yet. I routinely sleep 10+ hours per day and caffeine is the only thing that makes me functional. I'm also having trouble finding the energy to exercise at all. I've gained a considerable amount of weight in the past few months. Frankly, I've never felt this depressed, weak, tired, or unmotivated before in my life. The pandemic probably hasn't helped either.

I finally went to the doctor for the first time in months last week and my blood test showed elevated liver enzyme (though not alarmingly high). That could be a factor in how I'm feeling as well. I'm getting more tests done. Who knows? Maybe I damaged my liver a bit while I used.

I took off from working for several months last year to give myself time to fully recover. It was the right call, but finding a new job after that was really tough. Many employers passed on me because of the gap in my work history. It took hundreds of applications and months of interviewing, but I finally got something good back in January. It's a demanding role, which may also be contributing to my not-so-great mental state, but the company is in a solid place despite covid-19 and my job is secure. I'm one of the fortunate ones right now, and I don't take that for granted.

Overall, it's been a mixed year. Some days are good, most are ok, and a few are really bad. However, I haven't used in a year. I can't believe I've come this far.

Been waiting on this sub since like, tuesday or wednesday I think. 

Thats when I expected it to come so the day before that I stupidly took my last little piece of bupe, and have been in withdrawal since then. Took 3 Loperamide tabs yesterday which killed like half of the WD symptoms, which leaves me with the question, should I even take the sub on monday? Been trying to kick that last fraction of a mg since 3 months and not succeeded, could this be the forced start of my time in sobreity I keep thinking. 

Anyways, could it be easier to just continue with like 3 Loperamide tabs tomorrow too (thats all I got anyway) and then rip the bandaid off sort of thing since this last step in the taper has taken so long. 

Been faking having thinking I caught COVID to everyone to stay isolated since the WDs came and am feeling kind of weirded out psychologically. Went and bought papers just now anyway so atleast I have weed tonight. Slept only about an hour each night, spent all my time awake in bed thinking about the kind of shit you shouldnt during WD.

 I hate this feeling and I am kind of scared I will still take the bupe if it comes on monday. How should I refocus my mind? It may seem like a really small dose, but its on the end of a looong history of severely abusing opiods every day, dont know if thats whats making it harder but anyway.",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8366453}"

I try to ask him how he came to that conclusion and he tells me I don’t get to question him as he grabs my arm and forces it behind my back. I’m not resisting in any way, yet he felt the need to yank my right arm hard enough to leave a hand print shaped bruise. Then he put the cuffs on nice and tight as to leave marks. So we get to the holding cell and they do a breathalyzer test and I blow a ZERO. I sit there for about an hour when his partner said “we should probably take her to the hospital now to be checked over” so we go to the hospital they cuff me to a chair, they draw blood samples which come back with only methadone. When that comes back the cops look at it, write some bogus ticket that doesn’t make sense, take the cuff off and let me go! Like the ticket doesn’t even have drugs on it!

Long story short I used h via injection. Woke up on a stretcher with police, my girlfriend screaming wtf and EMTs around me. My girl found me face down in the garage. I guess I fell and hit my head too. She said I had already turned blue and gray and barely had a pulse, she called 911 and 15 minutes later they showed up and gave me narcan. The cop told her I didn't have a pulse and was pretty much dead when he arrived ( I don't remember any of this so I'm going off what she said) but I came too thinking I had been at the neighbors house which I wasn't and I couldn't remember a thing besides putting the hotdogs on the grill and going to the garage. I didn't remember using, I didn't remember buying the stuff, nothing they didn't find any of the paraphernalia around me or anything. I didn't go into withdrawal or anything just puked a bunch later that night. I refused to let them take me to the hospital not having insurance which probably wasn't too smart either, but here I am.

I wanted to make this post to share my story. At the time of writing this I am 13 hours since my last use. 

I've been on opiates for 2.5 years. I've tried to quit many times with little to no help from the doctors.
For context I live in Australia. (Today for the first time ever, I was linked to a doctor who offered to enter me a Suboxone Program) 

I decided there is no point jumping to Suboxone as it will only replace one thing to another. I've researched Suboxone and came to the personal choice of not touching as I've heard it can be hell to come off.

I started using opiates initially for back pain, but then relied on them for happiness as I was going through undiagnosed depression at the time. They made me feel amazing. This was the fun stage.

I continued with my use holding down a full time job, and providing for my family for 2 years. Throughout that time I made my way up to 30 x 30mg Codeine per day, which is unbelievably high (to me) and I've been working up the courage to quit. As of 6 months ago I've been to every doctor in my area and surrounding suburbs with no luck of a medically assisted supervised withdrawal.

I'm now at the point where I am NO LONGER a functioning addict and realised that I have dug myself into a hole and although I can't blame anyone but myself, the medical community has all but abandoned people like me. (Other than getting a call today saying I've been accepted for Suboxone program).

If you are currently using or have just started please let this story motivate you to discontinue your use and change your life for the better.
I am prepared for the hell the awaits me for the next few days but I've realised that if I don't go through this and kick this, my life will be ruined. I have counselling appointments coming up and I will work on myself to identify the underlying issue of why I turned to opiates.

I will update this post with my progress over the coming days and sincerely hope to be able to conclude this post with a happy ending. For everyone  struggling right now, please know there is hope. Hope is not on the assistive medication, hope is not in using to escape the thoughts of withdrawal. If you plan to do this, known the pain is temporary and it will subside.

I know that I'm not in the best place to give out inspiration but you have to hold on to whatever hope you have, muster all the self power you have and do this for you and for those that love you. I promise, it's only a week of misery and a new life waiting for you on the other side. 

If anyone needs to talk, I'm here, and I probably need the talk more then you do so don't hesitate to DM me. 

God speed my friends.

UPDATES:

UPDATE #1: 16 hours in and I am getting sweats, I'm soaked, hot and cold at the same time and have pain all over my body. It will pass and I'm occupied with binge watching Prison Break. Right now, I'm focusing on the hours. I will have a hot shower soon. It's 4:41am but no sign of sleepiness, but very tired (if that makes sense).

UPDATE #2: 20.5 hours in now and the WD are real. The aches are real. I assume it will be a little worse for a few days from here and it will start to be okay. To the beautiful comments that I have received from the community, thank you. Thank you so much. I read all your comments and Directs regarding WDs and sharing your view for Suboxone. At this point, the decision not to use Suboxone is a personal one, as I am fully ready to be done 100%. 20 hours in and I can still say that ..

If you have left me a comment, believe me I have read it, and if you have sent me a direct, I've also read  it and appreciate you all, I'm just trying to muster enough strength to write this update and crawl back into the the fetal position.

UPDATE #3: I've now made 24 hours and I feel fine. I'm sweating like a pig but I'm also cold at the same time. I purchased magnesium and vitamin c supplements. I also went for a walk for about 20 minutes. I feel good but the aches, sweats are the worst!

UPDATE #4: Hardest update to type, I'm 48 hours in now. Not giving up. I keep telling myself it's not an option. See you on the other side friends.

UPDATE #5: 2 days and 3 hours in. This is just a rant. I've entered into an AA program that starts on Monday and also have a counselling appointment on Friday. I've been working on setting up myself for success because last time I did this I underestimated acute WDs (psychological part of the journey that comes after physical WDs). I don't think this step can be underestimated. I need help, from those who go through the same struggles, and a professional and I intend to access all those resources to make sure I don't relapse.

UPDATE #6: 2 days 5 hours in, I thought I'd talk to you guys about how I feel and what I've been taking to help.
I feel great right now, it won't last long but I just feel great, I pushed through the sweats and I went for a 20 minute run. Oh my God. Do NOT underestimate exercise guys. I did it out of desperation and it definitely works. I know it will be short term and I'll go back to feeling shit but for now I feel great.
So, what am I taking? Here is the list
- Magnesium
- Vitamin C
- Immodium (Anti-diarrhoea) 
- Lavender oil to feel calm
- Propranolol 80mg per day
- Diazepam 4x 5mg per day (I only have 3 days supply as I don't want another addiction) 
- Milk Thristle for liver detox

Even with all these supplements I am going through hell. But I know if I endure I will get my life back. It's a small price to pay. 

Also, showers, 2-3 per day. For some reasons while I'm in that shower, the WDs just go and I escape. I don't know why but they just do.

UPDATE #7: 3 Days clean in 2 hours. I am grateful for each and every one of you.
I don't know how to bring this up but I no longer have physical WDs.. I just woke up and it was all gone. Is my mind playing tricks on me?
I have signs of oncoming acute withdrawals because now my mind is starting to wonder (I will never take action in the thoughts though). Is it possible that the physical withdrawal can be gone? I'll be 3 days clean in about 2 hours. I'm confused but I also feel like I've been freed.

UPDATE #8: 4 days clean now. 95% of the physical withdrawals are now gone. The depression is real and it's crippling. I do get bursts of happiness because how proud I am to be clean and I made it, but I'm primarily depressed right now.

UPDATE #9: Day 5!!!! My physical withdrawals are now fully over. My depression is very real and cravings are there, however I will NOT give in otherwise my whole work will be fully wasted. 

I have the blessing of some of you who are constantly checking in with me. I have also had a few people reach out for advise. If ANYONE needs help, reach out to me, I'm here.",23,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43606117}"

I know I need to stop as soon as tomorrow if don’t want to experience PWD’s (at least 24-48hrs before treatment)....","I’m seeking MAT help to get put on Suboxone but keep getting told they won’t allow me to if I’m on the benzos... it’s the only thing that helps me with the anxiety and insomnia when I first start getting WD symptoms. 
I was told by a lady at the facility that bc I take benzos it would disqualify me from being a candidate for Subs, and they’d recommend I start on Methadone until I can become a more “stabilized patient”... unfortunately my medical doesn’t cover the methadone, only Suboxone, so Idk what to do to get around this.

Should I cold turkey everything until Thursday? Will the benzos show up in my UA?  

Can I continue using Adderall while on Suboxone if it’s not prescribed to me? I honestly feel like I’ve self diagnosed myself with ADHD which is why I buy those meds off the street bc I could never get myself to talk to a doctor since I didn’t think they’d take me seriously. 

I’m ready to get off the Oxys, which I feel is my main problem.

The benzos, like I said, they just help get thru hard times and I don’t think I’ll have a problem stopping those... but I just don’t know what to expect from my 1st MAT appointment. 

Any suggestions on what I should/shouldn’t do to prepare?
I’m going to try suuuper hard tomorrow not to take any oxys or at least the most minimal amount of possible once I start to feel symptoms of discomfort. Two days until my appointment and I feel like it’s going to be the longest two days everrrr",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6690322}"

I've been using it as a crutch due to me not knowing how to handle my house burning down, and I've just suppressed all of those feelings behind mostly Dilaudid, but also any other opiates I can get my hands on. (Percs, roxies, hydros, and morphine are my other go to's) it's been well over a year of Dilaudid steady though. Before the Dilaudid, I was taking about 40mg of oxy a day for about 2 years. But I would cycle. 5 month on, one month off, 3 months on, 2weeks off, etc. Im 22 now, but when I was somewhere around 16 or 17 I fell deeply in love with Heroin. I managed to kick the Heroin by moving away from my home town, and it really wasn't too hard. But I just have no clue how to say no to opiates. I've been fucking with them on and off since I was 12.

Anyway, now my girlfriend of 4 years and I are about to move in to our first apartment far away from where we have grown up. I decided to go cold turkey roughly two and a half days ago, and this is the first time I've had to deal with any of the bullshit that happened and it's fucking me up. I've taken 0.5mg of Xanax to try to stop the anxiety that is tag teaming the depression I have, and I don't know what to do. I have a prescription for xans, but I don't want to trade a opiate problem for a benzo problem. I'm just, venting I guess. 

I have no one to go to about this shit. So I keep it completely in the dark. My brother, who is also my Best and only friend, is on xans hard and yesterday after telling him I'm trying to quit all this shit, he kept insisting that we go out and buy a few more and celebrate. So he's no help. I can't talk to my girlfriend because as much as I love her, we have been thru this before. And she told me if I lie about taking pills and shit again, it's done. And what do I do? Lie about taking pills, while high as fuck on them. All this while all of my plugs are constantly hitting my line telling me about the shit they have for sale, So all I have is me. 

I'm moving in 1 month and am doing this so that I can support my girl and maybe be a person who is worth a fuck and can provide something. I just see no end to this shit in sight. I want a future, but all of the suicidal thoughts I've had before this, are back in full effect, which make me not give a flying fuck if I even have a future or a tomorrow. I already dealt with manic depression and anxiety disorder before this, and this has just completely fucked it.  If you've read this far, thank you.

Sleep is still a very iffy thing. I have RLS, but for my whole body. I keep my partner up and I have woken up with my fist in her face. The meds they gave me for RLS keep me awake. Exercise doesn't matter, same with the nausea. I put it to the test. Also maybe 5-6 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky.

I was prescribed suboxone to get off the pills along with clonopin and xanex which looking back, seems incredibly irresponsible of my dr. Needless to say I was way more high off that combo then I ever was off the oxy’s. This was around 2009 and following my drs advice and not knowing any better I stayed on the subs for five years. I would occasionally try to use while on subs but i really remember is how terribly depressed I was during those years. I would constantly lose jobs simply because I was too depressed to get out of bed. My girlfriend who had been with me since before drugs came into the picture eventually left me and I ended up living in my step mothers basement. I repeatedly tried and failed to kick the subs, I would sometimes make it a month or more but eventually come to a point where I couldn’t take the discomfort anymore. As crazy as it sounds I eventually turned to heroin to get off the subs thinking I would just use for a short period to get through the first week or so. I guess it sort of worked but I ended up with a severe intravenous heroin/coke habit that lasted for a few years. I finally hit my bottom and got myself into rehab in March 2016. I was ready and I desperately wanted to get clean. The first few weeks are a blur, I refused suboxone while in detox and basically just sweat it out. I got out April 2016 and began the process of picking up the pieces of my life. I was 31 years old and was basically starting over my life from scratch. The first two years things were great. I honestly loved being sober and living and enjoying life. I began a career working with special needs kids and eventually got certified as a behavior therapist (ironically). Right around my two year clean anniversary I suffered a bad back injury and was recommended kratom. I really knew nothing about kratom, I tried it years before while trying to kick subs but didn’t find it helpful and never gave it much thought after that. At this point being two years clean it definitely worked and it gave me that old opiate feeling in my stomach that I loved so much, next thing I knew it was months later and I’d been taking it every day. I couldn’t seem to stop and even though the WD’s are far milder then heroin it was still very uncomfortable and I would find myself justifying using it, like what’s the big deal, they sell it at gas stations, it’s so mild anyway, ect ect but the truth is it reopened that addict part of my brain and things gradually got worse from there. I found myself dabbling with pain pills again over the next year and eventually this past Christmas I ended up relapsing on heroin. I’m so disappointed in myself. Those first two years of sobriety were honestly the happiest I’d ever been in my adult life and now here I am right back where I started. Now just to be clear I haven’t reverted to using needles, only sniffing and I’ve tried to do it at most every other day but as time passes I’m less and less in control and I hate myself so much for what I’m doing. I came clean to my girlfriend a few days ago who knew something was going on the last few months and the palpable disappointment on her face hurt my so deeply it was almost unbearable, compounded with the disappointment I already felt for myself it was heartbreaking. Anyway it’s time to get right, this is only gonna get worse if I don’t get my shit together and I’d come so far and have so much more to lose that I’d gained back over the last four years but I’m struggling. I’m on day four currently, The physical WD’s aren’t too bad but the loneliness and depression is absolutely crushing. I don’t know, I just needed to share where I’m at and maybe get some feedback.

I have been addicted to heroin for about 5 years, maybe longer and have decided to quit for real so I can go home and help with my family’s business. My dad built a wedding venue by his house because I’m a wedding planner and my parents have been scheming to get me to come home since I left 12 years ago. I currently live in Chicago and my parents live 5 hours away in the country and with Covid my business has died and I’m really struggling. There is no way I could keep up with finding opiates out there, the closest methadone clinic is over an hour drive, so a few weeks ago, I quit going to my methadone clinic, picked up a jab of heroin to ween myself off. I’ve made it through the first phase of withdrawal, the vomiting, not being able to eat or drink, diarrhea, etc. lasted about a week. After that I felt great, really proud of myself for not picking up, trying really hard because I’m almost 30 and I want the option of trying to have a child with my fiancé of 10 years, who is also an addict. Also I just want to have a normal life and be able to travel, etc. I still love doing drugs and I don’t want to be sober forever I just don’t want to be addicted to heroin anymore...anyway after that first week and maybe 3 days of feeling great I started experiencing insomnia. I haven’t had a full night of sleep in at least a month and I haven’t been able to fall asleep at all for three days now. I get really nervous and anxious and start getting restless, twitchy, random pain everywhere. To be completely honest I had some pills kicking around, Tylenol 3 and tramodol, that I used to kind of ween myself off and get some sleep after the worst part of withdrawal was over but I’m out now and don’t want to buy anymore opiates. 

Has anyone else out there quit in this way? Stopped taking methadone and weened yourself off heroin? Did this work for you? How long did your post acute withdrawal last? What were your symptoms? Did you find any supplements or medications or natural remedies that helped you sleep? I’ve taken valarium and kava in the past without much luck but haven’t tried it recently. I don’t want to take sleep medication because I don’t want to start a new addiction. Binaural beats give me crazy anxiety and weird nightmares... I also want to know I’m not alone. I’m attempting to get sober without rehab, MAT, or anything really. Super lonely. Strong will power and respect for my partner got me this far, he had a really bad round of seizures a few weeks ago he’s still recovering from, most likely caused by drug use. He’s still on methadone, possibly switching to Suboxone so it’s hard for me because I’ve decided to stop MAT.

Not sure who to turn to anymore or what to do next so I thought I might get some advice here. 
I have Crohn’s disease and am 30 y/o and was prescribed Tramadol for pain but now I’ve been abusing it for at least 6 months and I can’t seem to stop. I’ve been taking over 600mg daily and decided 3 days ago that enough was enough so tried to wean myself off and I’m in so much pain. Fever, diarrhea, vomiting, insomnia.. I’m going crazy. I don’t understand because I haven’t always been taking 600 mg a day (that’s pretty recent because I built up tolerance) and tried to go to 400mg daily and I feel like my body is shutting me down... 
I’ve never snorted, bought illegally or injected the meds I’ve just abused the dosages orally - I’m otherwise healthy with a great partner and family and I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m sick because of something else? Or maybe the meds have caused my liver to shut down? My brain is so foggy and all I can do is cry.. 
Should I go to the ER (I’m in Montreal Canada) will they help me? Do I go to rehab ? That seems intense .. I don’t know I just want to stop and I can’t seem to without being in so much pain .. 
what do you suggest? See a doc with a taper plan? I don’t really want to substitute for suboxone and all that stuff as I just want it to be over and I’ve heard a lot of ppl get addicted to that stuff. 
I feel a bit hopeless and very confused. Never thought I’d be in this position and I’m so scared people at the hospital will judge me - I’m so sensitive right now only my partner and best friend know about the issue.

I’m the front end manager of a successful local business, and don’t get sick days/vacation as if I worked for a large corporation. Currently have no insurance, because I’m waiting on open enrollment at my job. Ideally, I should be able to take a little over a week off in late august, and use it to detox. Until then, I can’t detriment my job, because it’s gotten me back on my feet.  

The physical part of my detox is the only part I’m scared of. Previously, I was a hardcore alcoholic. I’ve been through severe alcohol withdrawal more times than any 24 y/o girl should. I’ve kicked my opiate habit once, and the mental part is a cake walk compared to hell that is alcohol delirium. However, the psychical is hell on earth. 

I feel absolutely trapped. My current habit is smoking pressed 30s. When I started, I genuinely thought they were oxy, because a friend told me they were. I actually started on them because I was going through alcohol WD at home after about a two week bender. I was trying to taper off the booze, but couldn’t keep liquids down without vomiting. My roommate at the time was smoking these daily, and offered my some. I dabbled with opiates I’m highschool when access to them was easier, and I liked them, but not enough to form a habit. This time was different. That being said, now I’m physically addicted. 

My habit isn’t as bad as some. I buy 10 pills at a time, weekly, and it always lasts. So about a pill and a half a day habit? 

I decided this week I would just kick, thinking it couldn’t be too bad, but I can’t get past the 24hr mark simply due to the physical pain and restless legs. I have thursdays and Sundays off at work, so today was my test to see what my withdrawals were gonna be, and by 1pm I was drenched in sweat, tossing and turning, and felt like my bones were throbbing. There’s no way I could get through my usual 830-7 shift at work. I picked up, and I’m sitting here feeling defeated. 

I have a good life, and this addiction crept up on me. I wish I had someone to talk to who, so I decided to rant here,

This person in question was caught last summer with 22 grams of fentanyl and a scale in his car with his child and girlfriend after they both vehemently denied rumors they were selling.

He is on methadone and his girlfriend (also a former addict) are insisting they are both clean. She claims she has 2 years clean despite the drugs in the car with the child incident. I am trying to, like I said, begin building trust with these people. Strictly for the sake of the child.

The issue is, they still hang around with a group of friends who all struggled with addiction issues (IV fentanyl) in the very recent past, arrests less than a year ago, some of them. One in the group was found a year ago passed out in her car nearly overdosed, then during the fall she was arrested for fraudulent credit card use. So we aren’t talking years gone by of clean time. 

I can’t choose who they hang out with, but everything I read online tells me that if a person is serious about their recovery they have to remove themselves from people they used with. I browse this forum to get a feel for the struggles of those in recovery and to find a better understanding. 

My question for anyone kind enough to help me understand - is this true? I mean what are the odds a group of about 6 people who used together are all clean and will stay clean and can continue to associate? If they only associate occasionally is that somehow safer than regularly? Does an addict in recovery truly need to cut everyone off?

And I dont feel like I want to die anymore. Thats a feeling that I thought would never go away, but now I have to think hard about when the last time I was truly suicidal. I still have some pretty crazy anxiety a lot but at least I can face that now and get help instead of covering everything up with drugs.

&#x200B;

Next week my partner will finally be allowed to come visit me in my country. We normally lived in a third-bridge country between mine and his country, were supposed to see each other in early March but corona impeded it. He spiralled a lot alone, with depression, social isolation and constant exposure to fentanyl. He relapsed after months of being clean during this global lockdown. He is coming to visit me in rural, sunny Europe next week and I just want to know from you guys what is the best way for me to help with his pain once he is here. 

Was there anything that made you feel better in terms of (legal available) medications, vitamins, outdoor activities, avoiding certain foods (I know he sometimes get really nauseated) that I can equip myself with before he comes? 

In general, any great advice for the withdrawals specifically from fentanyl addiction? He uses gel... sticker patches sort of thing.

But I was a pretty active poster on r/o for a few years. Back when it was much smaller community. I make it a point to avoid all opiate subs these days on my main account and have essentially stopped logging into this account. Its just too much of a trigger. But I wanted to pop in just for today to offer some words of encouragement. If I can help just 1 person it'll be worth it. Like the title says I'm 2 years clean from Heroin as of today. Its been an interesting journey. The way my addiction started is so common its almost cliche at this point. First pills from an injury in HS. Graduated to Heroin a couple years later. And I eventually nodded my way through almost an entire decade. At my lowest point I was blowing through at least a gram a day. More if I could afford it. You know how it goes. 

Addiction is a monster. And recovery is a never ending process. But recovery is vastly superior to the alternatives. No one ever wins ""the game"" as people like to call it. You either end up in handcuffs or a box or both. I have had multiple friends pass from ODs, friends who have been murdered, friends serving very long sentences for crimes they committed purely out of the necessity to get their next fix. No one wins. If you've been lucky so far. That's all its been. Dumb luck. At the height of my addiction I lied, I stole, I burned bridges, I took advantage of people who cared about me. Looking back now I'm disgusted with myself and the lengths I was willing to go to so I could feed my habit. I thought I was too smart to get caught. But a life of lies is like a house of cards. It will crash down eventually. Its inevitable. I went nearly 10 years without a run in with law enforcement. Until I didn't. I ended up in handcuffs 2 times in less than a year. Lost 2 good jobs. And it probably saved my life. 

No matter how far down the rabbit hole you've fallen I promise you can get yourself out. But its nearly impossible to do it alone. I think I had about 50 ""last one ever"" attempts before I actually sought real help. If you're over all the bullshit. Reach out to a family member, a friend, your SO, a therapist, a clinic. Someone. People will help you. People want to help you. But you have to take that terrifying first step yourself. You have to accept that you need help. And you have to put in the effort. They might not trust you at first. They might not trust you for years. But trust is earned. And you have to earn it. So if you feel lost, if you're tired of it all, if you just can't keep doing what you're doing. Reach out to someone. Its never too late. 

I didn't go the 12 step route. Instead I opted for MAT and it has saved my life. I started at 16mg of Suboxone a day for the first year and have been reducing my dose very very slowly this past year. Im currently down to 1mg a day and I will continue to taper as far as I can. I know some people don't consider MAT as truly ""clean"" but honestly I don't give a fuck what those people think. I will actually have a couple beers if I'm camping. Or a glass of wine with a nice dinner. Alcohol was never my vice. I can drink in moderation so that doesn't worry me. Recovery is different for every single person. No 2 people will ever have an identical experience. If you know you need to be 100% sober that's ok. If you know you can smoke a bowl or have a couple beers without wanting to call the dope man that's ok too. Find what works for you. It ok to fail as long as you keep trying. No matter how far gone you think you are. No matter what you may have done. Its never too late to come back. Its never too late to recover. Choose life.

I have been on this roller coaster and merry-go-round for almost 10 years now. Like most, I started taking .5 tabs, once or twice daily, and before I knew it I was taking five to six 10 tabs, multiple times a day. Eventually, I stopped and remained clean for a few years. Then, about 4 years ago I was introduced to oxycontin. Like before, I  started out with one 15 a day, and very quickly I was taking three to four 30's at a time, multiple times a day. 

About 2 years ago I got into a MAT program and was prescribed 2 suboxone, daily - I would take one about every 12 hours. Honestly, I did pretty well with that. But, I wasn't in any type of counseling. So, the first time I faced a major event, I wasn't capable of handling it. After about 6 months I was back on the pills. 

About nine months ago I was introduced to heroin. I never thought I would get to that point. But, when there's a lack of money, a lack of product, and you're faced with withdrawals... well, you do what you gotta do. Currently, I use about  3-4 points a day, (snorting, I've never injected or smoked H.)

When 2020 got here, I knew I had to give this all up, and I really wanted to. Then... 

In January my 15-year-old son started self-harming,

In February my boyfriend/fiance of 6 years was killed in a car accident, 

In March I lost my home and my business was shut down due to the pandemic. 

Mid May I finally got to go back to work. But, since I am self-employed, I've really had very limited income, almost none. I am hoping to get an SBA loan, and maybe, unemployment will come through. 

I am ready to get clean and deal with all of these issues that have happened, head-on. I have tried to taper down on my own, but I am not having luck. The thought of withdrawals scares the s\*\*t outta me, literally. And, nobody knows that I have started using again. 

I know that getting into a MAT program is probably my best bet until I can get some counseling and therapy on how to handle my emotions and deal with issues as they come up. 

So, here's my question(s):

What are the pros and cons of getting a shot vs. using Sub strips? I am worried that until I get emotionally stable and deal with some things, I may go back to using. Even though you can't feel anything for 2-3 days, that didn't stop me last time. My hope is that with the shot I may have more incentive not to use since it lasts for 30 days. That would hopefully give me time to deal with things since it lasts longer. (I hope that makes some sense.) 

And, right now I am currently without insurance. I make to much for Medicaid and not enough for Obamacare/ACA. (I live in Alabama) Is anyone aware of any programs that help with the costs of either treatment and/or medication? 

I am sorry for the long post. 

Thank you, in advance, for taking the time to read this, and any advice or info that you can give me. 

I have been lurking around in this community for a long time, and I love the vibe and how helpful everyone is. 

I truly am exhausted with this life. And, I am so tired of being broke, being tired, and chasing something that is never going to happen.

All of this makes me angry and sad, and I just hate myself for getting myself in this position.

Other drugs including Vicodin and Percocet at 13 and was completely addicted to heroin at 16. I’m 25 now. I’ve been on suboxone since 21. The longest period of time I have clean is 6 months when I was 17-18 and institutionalized (wilderness and therapeutic boarding school) there’s a couple of other periods here or there where I managed to scrape a couple months without a physical addiction but still using occasionally before it all went back. The last time I fully kicked was right before 21 in rehab, before walking out early and going straight back. Hence the subs. Even on the subs I’ve found it impossible to completely stop using though my life has stabilized and most people think I’m doing fine. The first two years I had a several month long relapse each year. The last several it’s been more like I have a binge for a couple days or a week every 3-4 months. I’d like to get off the subs but that’s another thing. I was homeless from 17-23. My real question is has anyone made it? I don’t feel like I’ve ever met anyone or at least not that I remember who has such a long history of use going back so young who’ve managed to truly get their shit together. The only other people I know who got started so young and continued so long and are in their 30-40s or older are all still addicted with a lot of failed attempts. This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I just feel like the only thing I know how to do well is be a junkie. Not to mention the wiring of my brain that comes from having spent all my teenage years doing drugs and the problems with therapy that I have because of bullshit wilderness. Though I do have a therapist now, I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore I think you all get the idea.

Long story short I went on about a month long binge, with him. He ended up getting put into a detox center, and I went through withdrawal for the first time. I had no clue what I was in for. I went CT, and was in hell for about a week straight. 

Now, this was the first time. This was about two months ago. Since then, my friend got out of detox, and I relapsed.. 

My first time I was doing about 3-5 pills a day and was going for about a month. I’m currently at about 3 pills a day, and a little over two weeks into my relapse.

For my first detox my amazing boyfriend held my hand through it and took care of me. I took a week off work and basically cried in his bed the whole time while he took care of me. I swore I’d never touch drugs again and I really meant it. 

I wish I could take this relapse back. I hate myself for even touching these pills again. I can’t keep this up or I’m gonna lose everything. 

Being that I can’t take off work, I can’t CT this detox and need advice. 

Currently I have gabapentin, 12mg Ativan, and plan on buying some Kratom. Idk where to start, and I’m honestly just scared.

I’m 2.5 months clean from opiates, and 55 days clean from everything including alcohol. I was even in a mental hospital at one point because I tried to kill myself.

Then on to oxy, and once I realised that's a pretty expensive habit at 1€/mg, I settled on snorting bupe every day. Subutex is used recreationally around here because real opiates aren't as easily available and/or they're expensive.

I was snorting about 3 or 4 mg's per day on average. Quit cold turkey a couple weeks ago. Most of the physical withdrawal symptoms (RLS, diarrhea) are gone now but I don't expect to get a solid 8 hours of sleep until a few months from now at the earliest. I work part time, had to call in sick and miss two days.

The main point I want to get out there is honesty to yourself. I've quit before and taken breaks, but it was never honestly for real. There was always that thought in the back of my head that I'll get back on to using before long.

This time it's been so much easier to quit, because I have no more interest in this bs. Maybe it's just a part of getting older and the maturity that comes with it, but when you'll truly, honestly, want to quit, you'll notice it, you'll know it because it's a different state of mind.

Some other thoughts

Summertime like right now is the absolute best time to quit because it's hot outside. Helps with the chills.

I'd recommend caffeine for the lethargy and lack of energy. I wasn't a regular coffee drinker while using, but forcing yourself to brew up a couple cups helps get you up from the couch.

Food actually feels good! It's pretty amazing to feel hungry again for the first time in who knows how many years and stuff your face full of take out. I've gained several kg's in two weeks.

It's seriously just a couple weeks of feeling uncomfortable. The worst feelings are right as you wake up from your 45 minute naps drenched in sweat and hyperventilating, but that passes. 

Yeah it sucks, but what is that compared to getting clean? Not worrying about money (at least as much) any more. Feeling emotions again. Enjoying listening to music like you can't even remember. Not having to keep secrets from family members. Being able to travel without worrying about smuggling those pills you ""need"". 

Nevermind everything that comes with being addicted to illegal shit, like having to associate with criminals, risking getting busted by the cops, everything. No thanks. I'm done with all that. I'm on day 17 out of ten thousand, and I feel confident and great about it. I'd just like to make the point again to anyone reading this that you might not be totally realistic with yourself about quitting - and that's all right. It took me ten years to be finally done. Just be honest with yourself.

The current arrangment is that I live with my boyfriend and he picks up the medication and looks after it. I ask him when I want some and he'll decide whether he wants to give me some then. He's decided on 2 pills in the morning, 3 at midday and 3 before dinner. He used to be pretty lenient and we would work together, but as time has passed, he's become far stricter with this. 

Anyway, I made a plan to buy some and keep it hidden for myself in case I needed a pickup or was in pain and have run out of my daily pills or my bf doesn't believe me. I was up all morning waiting by the door for 6 hours, and just as I got the package. He demanded for me to hand it over because ""You don't order anything I can't see, I know it's drugs"". I managed to quickly hide some and he still doesn't know where it is.

Then we spoke. He obviously wanted me to hand it over so I didn't ""throw away my progress"" and so he wouldn't be worried about me possibly ODing. I know he's going to be grumpy and follow my every step until I hand it over. I completely get why he wants to hold it for me as I'm cery impulsive and untrustworthy, but I just can't do it. In this conversation the phrase ""if you take those drugs, I [he] can't do this [helping me quit] anymore"" came up. I replied ""I don't think I'm ready to quit"". 

He told me that it doesn't matter and I have no choice; I have to quit, and I have to do it for September. He also emphasized that everything I do affects him and he's stressed from me wasting our money. This is the big issue. Everyone around me doesn't seem to care how I feel, how I want to quit and if I'm ready. I'm expected to completely quit by September otherwise I'll be given up on and be a failure. I don't know what to do. I've considered the idea of breaking up until I sort myself out, but I'm entirely financially dependent on him, and every time I've threatened to break up with him, he just said no.

I don't think I can take the pressure, and somehow it's making me want to quit even less. The only way out I can think of is suicide, but even then, I'd just cause people I love financial difficulty. I feel trapped. What should I do? What can I do? Please help.

[NOTE: I'm fed up of specialists and people I ask for advice calling him abusive; he's not. He's just doing what he thinks is best for me - a very mentally damaged, impulsive, irresponsible person. I just need advice on coping with feeling pressured]

How much could people even be charging anymore? I used to pay $100+ minimum for a G. How much would that cost now? $200? $300?

Inevitably, I would find myself “self-isolating”...but instead of binge-watching shows, going on walks, and trying to stave off boredom by learning to bake; I would spend every day puking, shivering, restless, and hurting. Instead of sleeping in, I would be painfully restless and unable to sleep. I would desperately be searching for ways to make money, and for someone to turn that money into a few short hours of relief for me.  
Maybe it would be what I needed to realize it was time to be done for good. Likely, I would call it a “tolerance break”. Who knows, maybe when I finally did use again after that tolerance break, it would be my last time (a fate I’m sure will happen to more than a few poor souls out there who will be overly eager to return to using).

I’ll like to share some info about myself and some back story on how I started using opiates.

I’m currently 22 years old turning 23 in a few months time and I’ve been using opiates few months before i turned 20. With that said I’ve been using for about 3 years now. 

How I started using is kinda complicated. I grew up in a really bad neighbourhood in a really strict country in South East Asia but some how dealers still managed to get away with selling all sort of narcotics. The neighbourhood that I live in had dozens of dealer and on almost on every block you’ll find a runner because of how accessible drug were I started smoking weed when u was 14 years old I’ll do it occasionally and for recreational purposes however when I was 18 years old I was brought back by narcotics officers during a drug operation in my hood and I was tested positive for marijuana.(this is gonna piss some people off but in my country marijuana is considered a schedule 1 drug and anyone tested positive for it faces up to 10 year imprisonment) but as a first timer I got away light with just 1 year in prison. When I go out I started seeking other alternatives to get high because I didn’t want to go back to weed as 2nd offence is 2 years and above. That why I started drinking codeine based cough syrups which is just a schedule 3 drug and u practically won’t get in trouble for it . At first i was only doing it 2-3 times a month but i gradually started doing it more and more often till now where I’m using on a daily basis and on a very high dosage.its been like that for over a year now and I’m so dependent that if i skipped a day I’ll get nasty withdrawal especially insomnia , anxiety , body aches and Diarrhoea the very next day. 

I’ve been thinking of quitting for the last two month but with not many friends and family to support it’s really though. So I’m seeking help from anyone in this community to help get off this nonsense. I’ve already set some goals and I think it’s finally time to get my life straight.

I have no idea where to start should I do a tapper ??? Or cold turkey ??? I’m feeling really helpless right now and I’m reaching out to any kind souls out there to guide me on how to quit/ recover

These are the substances I use 

1) Dhasedyl Syrup Per 5ML
 (Codeine phosphate  9mg,  ephedrine HCl 6mg,  promethazine HCl3.6 mg)

2) Codeine tablets 

3) Dihydrocodeine

4) Tramadol

Idk man I feel like when u take enough good acid the intense emotion up and downs and feeling of amazment/appreciation etc kinda resets your emotional equilibrium from that mundane dark ass shit u get so used to when ur using. 
In short I fucken love life now man
I'm getting chubby already and don't even care fuckit
I rediscovered how much I love life and appreciate things I really took for granted 
I rediscovered my passion for music and good ass food
I feel like my mind works differently as if my ability to think critically and concentrate on complicated shit really kinda just came back.
Idk I feel like I understand the reasons why I was getting high as well too
As u can tell I had some great trips lol
Life is beautiful yaal those four weeks were worth it
I haven't even counted the days I don't even Kno the last time I used I just know IDGAF and that shit sounds nasty man 
I understand im an addict
I get restless and unhappy and dark 
But I found out I can take a hit or five of acid and completely get myself out of that mentality for a long period after
Instead of using something else like heroin and trapping myself in that dark place I know is gonna pop up
I'm cool with this

I have my issues with this place but overall I think it is an incredibly useful resource and I am very grateful to be here.

My biggest problem with the sub is that I feel like I can't be honest with people. It isn't coming from some place of trying to shame someone, or make them feel bad about themselves. The truth hurts, point blank. But running away from the truth will not help you better yourself or become a better person. I've watched some of the same people relapse over and over again for years because they can't handle constructive criticism. I understand it isn't my battle but to know I just sat there and wasn't honest with a person isn't okay with me. 

For example: recently I suggested someone go to a psych ward because they were actively planning to kill themselves. I got flamed on here for saying I was being insensitive and judgmental. I got at least 3 messages from different users saying they backed me up and agreed with what I had to say. Why couldn't they post in that thread? I think its because the culture around here is just trying to make people feel comfortable and to not actually deal with any of the root issues of the main problems.  

At the end of the day this is life and death shit... I'm not going to sacrifice someone's well being so they can feel their temporary comfort from being lied to. You have 2 weeks clean but you use weed/alcohol/mushrooms/molly .... and I'm supposed to just sit here and not at least try and help? I think everyone here should be welcome and people shouldn't be put down for what they do, but I also think people should be able to openly and constructively have a dialogue without fear of being ostracized for being honest.

This is what i learned about opiate addiction by reading, Journaling,  and observing others.
 

First of all, opiate addiction, or any addiction for that matter, is a serious mental condition. It's more than ""I'll just detox myself and stop doing that"". It's complicated. And requires a whole new perspective on life.


It's a fact that a lion strikes down his prey with his paw, in which his strength resides, and not with his tail like the crocodile. In a similar way our habitual reactions are normally characterized by the application of our most trustworthy and efficient function. It's an expression of our strength. 


In the struggle for existence and adaptation everyone instinctively uses his most developed function, which thus becomes the criterion for his habitual reaction. 


My most developed function had become escapism and my habitual reaction to situations was to get high. This is analogous to the lion trying to take down a gazelle with its tail. It was starving me. Mentally, physically, and spiritually. 


To truly put my addiction in the past will require me to change my habitual way of reacting. Any behavior that can be called intelligent should work towards a purpose. Smoothly, quickly, and effectively. Now think about that. Is there an intelligent purpose for putting a needle in my arm? I can't think of one.


I hope you all can grasp this concept. This goes way beyond ""I'll just stop but still smoke weed or drink"". We, me included, are broken people. Beating an addiction to the greatest feeling on earth requires a reworking of the fundamental characteristics of who we are as human beings. It means starting over from the ground up. Constructing a whole new persona. New attitude, new goals, and a new outlook that requires a sense of purpose. A whole new drug free you. 


Addiction is cunning, baffling, and powerful. It's also progressive. Don't fool yourself and don't play games. It's hard work to stay clean. It's a minefield of existential crises that must be navigated properly.
I need honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness. Then the will and discipline to make new habits permanent. I'm building a new me and everyday the first step is to simply not take that drug for the next 24 hours. We can do this guys. The real work starts after detox and i needed to be institutionalized to realize that.

Please consult medical professionals to taper down before jumping. It will be much better.

The facts:

* 8 years Suboxone  8/2 strips (24 mg per day)
* 2 years on Buprenorphine tablets 8mg. X 3 (24 mg per day)- cheaper.

Started like a lot of us. Was prescribed 0piate pain medication for a back injury. Took more and more pills trying to have the same relief and effect.

After 2-3 years of taking the opiate pain medicines, a way was provided for me to receive the much needed back surgery. Of course after the surgery the pain became less and less of a factor but the opiates were still being prescribed and taken.

I was referred by a friend to a doctor who prescribed Suboxone. I made the appointment and was prescribed 24 mg per day. ( 3- 8/2 mg strips)

In hind sight, this was way too much but we live and learn.

After around 10 total years, I decided I was done.

**So-**

43 days ago I jumped from 24 mg per day to 0, cold turkey.

**I want to reiterate ""Please do not take this route"" it is not smart or heroic and should not be attempted.**

I had tried to taper a few times along the way but that did not work for me.

**Below is a summary of what I experienced. I did not want to post too long of a story. Most of us know the story anyway. I would be happy to respond to any comments in case I missed anything.**

**Day 1-3:** because of the subs long half life, the first 2-3 days were not terrible. Mostly just cravings out of the habit of daily doses.

**Days 4-20:** ever increasing anxiety, RLS, insomnia, general malaise, NO ENERGY, sweats, stomach issues etc.

**I do not want to gloss over the anxiety part of this. Maybe it was because of the high dose jump off or the length of time i took it but the anxiety was ""FOR REAL"" and difficult to go through, to say the least.**

**Day 21-22:** had semi decent days, more mental clarity. Stil had severe RLS and impossible insomnia. The worst of the anxiety was disapating around this same time. (Thank God)

**Days 23-30:** RLS continued through day 30. It got a little better each day during this period. The insomnia did not improve. Sleeping at night was impossible for me. During the day I could sometimes catch an hour or two, mostly broken up in to 30 minute increments. I took 2 weeks vacation after the first 3 days of the withdrawal and worked from home for a few days after that so I was not working again until around day 19 or 20.

**Days 31 to 43 (Today):** A lot of the more severe symtoms are gone or much less. The insomnia is sporadic but have been able to sleep a little during the night sometimes. I still have very, very low energy and drive. I have to make myself, push myself into action. Also a pretty severe depression has creeped its way into my world. I expected this however, so no suprise.

&#x200B;

Again, I wanted to keep this as short as possible. Further information or detail can be explored through the comments and response section.

I would not generally even post about this except for after experiencing this myself, my compassion goes out to anyone who might be going through this themselves.

This post is meant to inspire hope, not fear. I hope it reaches someone who needs to hear it.

I need help/a plan,"So a little background: 2 years ago I was clean for 9 months. I got on the monthly vivitrol shot and it pretty much saved my life. The first couple weeks of trying to stay clean until the shot and then the first couple weeks after the shot were absolute hell. Then my GF left me, I relapsed and have been trying to get clean ever since. In January, I was clean for 13 days. My doctor gave me some benzos, sleeping meds and some Clonidine to detox at home. After around 7 days I was supposed to take the pill version of Vivitrol to ensure that I wouldn't have any horrible reactions to the shot. Before this attempt I had taken the Vivitrol pill early 2 times and have lived through the absolute hell of precipitated withdrawal. Anyway, after 13 days of being clean (6 more than the doc suggested. I waited because I wanted to be absolutely SURE that I would not have to go through precipitated withdrawal again) I took the pill and and a half hour later was in the fetal position on the floor puking nonstop. I threw up every sip of water I drank for the next 10 days. The only reason I stopped throwing up was because I started using again. I literally just couldn't handle it. I ended up at the urgent care during one of those ten days (my 30th bday to be exact...not so great for morale) for an IV of fluids because I was so dehydrated. I thought I was going to die it was so bad. Usually they say that precipitated withdrawal should be over in a day or two. This lasted for ten days and only stopped because I used again.

During those ten days of absolute hell, the doctor gave me some nausea medication (can't remember the name of it but when I looked it up I believe it's prescribed to people going through cancer treatments). When he found out that I used again to stop puking, he said he wouldn't help me again with the at home detox cocktail. 

Here I am now. I don't know what to do. Ever since I started using to stop puking, I have been back to my miserable existence of using every day, wanting to die, no hope for the future, etc.

I don't want to lose my job so I don't know what to do. I obviously need like 3-4 weeks off, with no pay, and I guess my only option now is to check into a detox because my doctor won't help me do it again at home. 

I don't know if I'm allergic to Vivitrol or if the pill version is known to cause such a situation after 13 days of being clean. I want to try to get clean again and not take the pill/get the shot so that I won't puke for another 2 weeks and out of desperation start using again. 

What do I do? I realize this sounds like the frantic typing of a madman spewing nonsense and for that I apologize. It's been a few years of failed attempts and I just wanted to get most of the important details out there. 

So I guess what I'm asking is: has anyone else experienced such negative effects from the Vivitrol pill? How do I keep my job and also take time off to detox? Do I really have to go to a hospital to detox? I can't see myself going cold turkey at home with no benzos/sleep meds to get me through the first week.

I don't know. I'm at the end of my rope and am panicking over my available options. Sorry for rambling. Thanks for any help/suggestions you can provide.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7725529}"

Just because someone is on subs or methadone doesn’t mean they don’t have the right to celebrate their recovery and milestones and, yes, even call themselves clean. 

Each and every one of our recovery journeys is unique, and ultimately it’s up to the individual to define what recovery/clean means to them. For me, the most important part of recovery is being able to live happily and healthily. For the next guy, the most important thing may be complete abstinence from everything. Neither one of us has the right to dictate how the other chooses to think of their own progress. 

But more importantly....it is so completely and utterly inappropriate to say to someone in early recovery that their clean time doesn’t “count” because they’ve sought professional medical help. Hearing something like that when I was first dealing with the painful and terrifying transition from active addiction to living without abusing opiates? That would have hurt and discouraged me SO deeply. I needed love and support more than anything during that time. I didn’t need to be used as a prop for a debate so some selfish asshole could flex their superiority complex. 

I am just...begging you guys to think critically about the repercussions of tearing people down who are already at rock bottom. Do you really want to be the reason that someone gave up trying to recover? Because it was more important to you to make a point than to consider the bigger picture?

Wrong.

Every time I tried to get clean, it got harder. I got more tired. No, not just tired, I was EXHAUSTED. All my energy and motivation and drive had been eaten up by countless sleepless nights and nonstop pain and the pure internal agony that comes with being a fentanyl addict. Every time I fell I seemed to fall harder, and getting back up became tougher and tougher. 

I came to a point this final time where I knew...I knew I didn’t have another relapse in me. I knew I didn’t have the strength and willpower to fight through acute withdrawal again. I knew that if I used again, the chances of me getting clean again were practically nonexistent. I was just too exhausted to keep fighting.

I fell in love with my boyfriend earlier this year. When we met he had just hit 1 year clean. He was in a sober living at the time, I had 9 months (I now have over a year). We hit it off immediately and got really attached to each other very quickly. Being addicts we just dove right in. May not have been the right thing to do, but it felt right at the time. I've never felt this way before about someone. I love him so much, it's an indescribable feeling. Like we have known each other before, he feels like home, we understand each other. Felt like he was my person, I honestly don't think about anyone else. I love being around him and talking to him for hours. We have everything in common and he made me happier than I ever have been. But a lot happened...

A month into the relationship, seemingly going very well, he moved in with me (out of sober living) when the quarantine started. We thought at the time this would be way shorter than what it has come to. I was thinking in my head, I'm falling in love with this guy and want to spend 1-2 weeks with him. But, *he relapsed the day he moved into my place*, back into active addiction again for 2 months. I can't help but feeling like that was a betrayal after letting him into my home. And put my sobriety in jeopardy. Obviously a lot changed in our relationship and I saw the completely different side of him. He's such an incredible person when he's sober. The sober him, I want in my life. So badly. But the amount of lies, torment, and bad treatment I went through with his addiction really fucked me up. My mind won't let me believe anything he says anymore. I'm in constant paranoia. I want to so badly but I just can't right now. He moved back home across the country and has now has 2 weeks sober. That genuine laugh is back, that person I fell in love with is slowly returning. He isn't in outpatient or anything and only going to a few zoom meetings a week. I just keep worrying about his sobriety and if he'll be okay.

It was so hard feeling like I lost him for several months, and now that he is getting better and so far away, I'm heartbroken. He's obviously in the very early stages of sobriety and extremely fragile. He feels so horrible and keeps apologizing for everything. He wants me to give him once last chance. And I forgive him, but so torn. I don't know if he's coming back here. I don't know what the future holds. His ride with opiates has been 10 years+ , in and out of sober livings. I don't know if I could go through another relapse. I broke up with him last night and I feel so fucking sad. I don't want to do this. But something in my gut is telling me to. It's such a head over heart decision and my mind won't stop fucking with it. I want to be there for him, I have so much faith in him, but it drained the life out of me when he was here. He wants to marry me and have kids with me and all I can think about is this happening again in the future with higher circumstances like that. Especially so early on in getting to know him. I want him to get better on his own, and not feel like he needs me to be able to do this. I even told him my heart will always be open to him down the line once he gets his life back on track. He said the reason he is staying sober is for me, but he has to do it for himself. 

I feel so horrible for breaking up with him but I'm trying to put myself first. Which feels shitty for some reason. I have to realize I can't be his savior. I feel like we never got a fair chance. It's like I can't let go of wanting things to be different and not facing reality. Staying with him, I'm scared of what might happen. I would do anything for him, and that I think that's what scaring me. I lost myself only caring about him. Leaving him, I'm scared that I'm giving up on him, what if I can help him finally get through this once and for all. I do love him so much and feel that confident in our connection. this decision is killing me. God this fucking sucks.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5484945}"

All you need is some suboxone, the amount may vary depending on your tolerance and severity of addiction. I was doing what I presumed to be fentanyl pressed as oxy 30mg pills (were infinitely stronger than a real oxy 30) and here’s what I did:

Acquired 2 8mg suboxone sublingual strips, and started with a 1/3 of the strip. Depending on tolerance you might need more or less. If you’re unfamiliar with suboxone start small.

BE SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OPIATES IN YOUR SYSTEM. If you do have other opiates in your system when you take the suboxone, it will send you straight into precipitated withdrawals which in my experience are worse than regular withdrawals.

I waited until the day after my last use, you may have to wait longer depending on ROA you use (I was mainly smoking, and a small amount snorted).

Now over the next 5 days you want to slowly take less until you hit day 5. You may still feel withdrawals and feel free to take more if needed, but try not to exceed 5 days of use. i actually ended up taking all that I had left on the last day (1/3 a strip or 2.3mg). On day 6 you should feel a bit shitty but nothing close to acute withdrawals. Day 7 will be the worse day but my only issue was anxiety and heat flashes. I’m currently on day 13 and I feel so much better, only w/d symptoms I have is occasional hot flashes and some lingering anxiety. I completely skipped the week of shitting my brains out, not being able to sleep at all, and excessive sweating.

Me and 2 friends all used this method and achieved the same results. I’m hyper sensitive to withdrawals and this helped me be clean for longer than I have been in almost 3 years. This works because (I assume) although suboxone is technically an opiate and shares tolerance with other opiates, it’s physical dependence operates separately from other opiates. 

I seriously encourage anyone having trouble quitting to try this method if you can get your hands on some suboxone strips. Since January I have been trying to quit and haven’t been able to make it more than 5 days, I must have relapsed over 20 times because I can’t handle withdrawals but this method worked wonders for me.

 I have took a little tablespoon of kratom the past three days just to get thru the day my job is very physically demanding so it's hard to have motivation. I hope this isn't gonna regress me in anyway or throw me back into withdrawal. I don't feel it will, but idk. I don't plan to use the kratom on the weekends and I definitely don't plan on using it long term. The stuff is just too nasty tasting. 

Guess I'm just typing this to say there is life on the other side of the hell that is opiate addiction and if I can do it anyone can. My main driving motivation to stay clean is to not withdrawal again I absolutely hate the way it felt and can't stand not having energy. Seriously fuck opiates they will steal your soul.

I started snorting (never took oxy 30 orally, only ever snorted) 3 months ago... I realized I needed to stop when I did a laced pill and nearly overdosed... that was two weeks ago. I’ve been going through withdrawals by myself. I have no real urge to use again simply because this is the worst pain I’ve ever felt in all my 20 years of life...

I know that physical symptoms can last for 7 days, but it’s been exactly 13 days since I last used, and my stomach is super sensitive because it’s difficult for me to eat, but what REALLY bothers me is the terrible terrible back pain I have. I don’t have pain anywhere else but my spine, and I’ve never had back pain before... 

I’ve been taking a bunch of Aleve, I tried Kratom at around day 4 but it made me pretty much projectile vomit... I took suboxone twice. Once at day 5 when the pain was at its worst, and again 3 days after that. When I say I took suboxone, I took the tiniest sliver of a strip, the size of the tip of my fingernail. It helped immensely, but what I didn’t realize until the second time I took suboxone is that apparently it only postpones withdrawal symptoms, and it has a long half life which I’m assuming is why I took one tiny strip and I was ok for 3 days. 

I’m doing my best to not be dependent on anything... but this terrible debilitating back pain has not subsided. It’s been two weeks I thought by now I’d physically be over the withdrawal symptoms... 

My question is, how much longer (in your opinion) do you think this will last? I almost want to just go to the hospital it’s so bad... and other than taking more suboxone, is there anything you could recommend for back pain? The rest of my body is completely fine.. I don’t have leg spasms or a runny nose, I’m not even fatigued... it’s just this back pain that is painful enough to wake me up in the middle of the night after taking sleeping medication.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.697962}"

I feel like an empty shell of my former self before opiates and I cant fill it back up because of the hole left by opiates.

I also have a habit of self sabotage. Every time i started to get clean I would go back to school and do great for the first half of the semester.

I have it pretty good, I'm already on methadone so I probably won't get super sick. And if I do I can up my dose a bit. But 70 mgs seems to hold me fine, if I don't cop right after I'm out I'm not sick.

I know I'm obsessed with the ritual of fixing. And the dope is so cheap and easy to get. I can SEE the damn dope spot from the methadone clinic, practically!

I'm gonna do this. Just cane here to vent, and whine, and admit that I am really truly in the grip of this thing. I'm gonna ""fake it till I make it"" just put the needle down, walk away, and pray for the strength to stay away. (No, I don't think praying will motivate some all powerful being to miraculously cure me, but maybe it will help me focus my energy and manifest the strength I need, I know it is in me, I had significant clean time before.)

Struggling right now. I was 15 day’s clean from 5 year oxycodone habit from legitimate pain prescriptions. I was originally up to 150mg per day and worked really hard and found an amazing new pain doc to help me in six months to drop to 40mg and even 30 mg/day for a two month period.  then I dropped Completely after struggling to make my prescription last a month (my pain significantly increased through COVID as I wasn’t able to get the procedures and services (PT/massage/ epidurals/ lidocaine treatments etc)  that normally help my pain) this causing my prescriptions to run out a little early each month which in turn made me realize I probably have a problem and am abusing them if I cannot take as prescribed 4x per day- legit needed them more but was too proud to tell my doctor cause I’ve worked too hard to get where I am but my pain spiked (I know I’m justifying here-don’t attack me please). This past month I also suffered from medical issues outside my normal chronic pain issues (spine issues is my norm- emergency neck fusion after waking up paralyzed on my right side five years ago resulting in long term nerve damage to my neck and extremities and new issues with my back coming from this and a disease that’s eating away at my disks- currently have 7 herniated and 2 bulging in LB and thoracic and one at C 6-7). 

Overall I was pretty disappointed in myself the past three months running out a few days early. Prior I was proud of myself for dropping significantly, making changes in my doctor (as my first pain specialist who got me up to 150mg/day I told her I felt over medicated and didn’t need that Much and ended up turning in upwards of 30-40pills a month- I was told that I was “breaking my pain contract” as I was instructed to take 150mg and by not doing so I wasn’t following protocol!! WHAT THE F?!?!) Insane, so I needed to find someone willing to help me and support my goals in getting off these and Atleast to lower significantly as I was over medicated. Anyways enough of the background.....

So I ended up stopping 15 days ago and supplemented with Kratom to help with initial
Withdrawals (slightly helped I had a fear of getting sick on it) my withdrawals weren’t significant I was lucky (as I always took as prescribed or less than up to three months ago and always took tolerance breaks every couple months take 1 week off best I could (again until three months ago) and took the Kratom in hopes it would help with pain which is took a slight edge off but not much. Probably didn’t dose as high as I should have or use the right kind (ordered the good stuff online) but overall mostly didn’t like the feeling that it gave me - there were a few
Positive experiences with mood lift and energy. 

Anyways, ended up in emergency abdominal and pelvic surgery today for which they heavily medicated me with OxyContin and oxycodone (pre and post op) in hospital as well as all the medications during the surgery - overall I am disappointed in myself because I was making positive progress. I was prescribed pain meds for post op and I need them. I have tried all day to suffer through the pain but in tears and cannot handle the pain the incisions are huge and painful and they had to remove an ovary and that is so bad I am in so much pain I just feel like I’m failing at my recovery right now. 

Also these past 15 day’s I’ve had serious moments and flair ups which were completely uncontrolled leaving me in tears in a ball on the floor. I am thinking that I might actually be a patient who needs the medication but just for flair ups and obviously surgeries. I think what I’ve learned is over the past 15 day’s that I don’t need to be a daily user it just was my norm and worried about coming off of that crutch. Obviously I admit to taking too much and running out a few days early during these awful painful times. Truly horrific pain more than I’ve had in five years the past three months- pain that Kratom and natural remedies aren’t touching. But I feel Guilty for saying that. I feel Guilty for needing to use them. I want to get off of them but the reality is until I am “fixed” I’m not sure I am able to. That being said I also don’t think I need to use daily anymore and rather when that pain hits a 9/10 crying in a ball On the floor pain is when they’d be helpful and useful. I think/know I can do that at this point. I’m just scared after my use
Of them for post op I might fall back into my daily norm- although I’m more motivated than ever to not- I am currently prescribed 50mg/day (5 10s percs right now)... and I’ve only taken 1 when I could no longer handle anymore... progress?!

Anyways I’m not really hear for much more than to vent my feelings and disappointment and reality. I think I’m disappointed that during this time I actually need the medication. I also realize that I might have to be someone that actually needs these medications though not on a daily basis until I can hopefully get my two more back surgeries, recovery from pelvic surgery and find natural solutions to my pain. 

I’m here to vent and I know this was long, annoying and possibly confusing and I apologize. I appreciate anyone who actually read it or skimmed it- ha!  Thanks for listening and allowing me to speak here. I am a long time viewer of all the posts here as I have been serious from The start of my decreasing to now. I have enjoyed seeing everyone’s successes and support to one another and it’s an incredible community. Thank you again!

TL;DR (did I do that right?): venting session - was 15 day’s off my prescription meds and had emergency surgery today- realize I need them
During this time and possibly the future but in a different capacity. I have really struggled with pain in the past 3 months",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67585415}"
