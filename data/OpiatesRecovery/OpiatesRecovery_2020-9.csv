He however did admit to popping zans and perc 15s occasionally. This past week he started acting really weird twds me, not wanting to come back home ( we have 2 children together) and just really irritated with me. He just wanted to be left alone, so Friday he tells me his stomach felt weird and he’s tired , Saturday comes around and he’s tells me he’s been throwing up all night and he hadn’t been to sleep in 2 days, hes super anxious, cold and has the chills. So right off the bat I don’t know what’s going on, I assume he has covid lol, i bought him one of my fast acting panic attack meds(benzo), some water, and vegetable pho and he literally took one bite and threw everything up, and curled back up in bed. He begged me to stay and lay down with him and still thinking he’s sick, I told him I have to find someone to take the kids because I don’t want them to get sick (I didn’t want to get sick either) but he insisted he wasn’t sick but from the outside looking in, not knowing what’s going on, i couldn’t tell the difference. I brought him zofran and promethazine(pill form) for his nausea and vomiting, i have leftovers from my pregnancy. Then I came back home and thought ... hmmm it seems like he’s going through withdrawal, so the next day rolls around and he asks me to come over with the kids(3 and 6 months) and he sounded way better, but my guard was still up and we kept our distance, and he tells me .. “I think i’m having weed withdrawals, it’s been a few days since I’ve smoked” and in my head i’m like “BULLSHIT” but I was like ... “I know you said you take some pills occasionally, did you stop taking them? Do you think thats why you’re feeling this way”? I said it as nice as possible because I didn’t want to trigger him, or make him feel bad abt his dealings. He said, “Yes, low key i think that could be it.” I asked him how many he would take in a day and he said he doesn’t even know, but said he wants to come off and is now only taking 1-2 a day. Since we’ve talked on Sunday, he has been so transparent and honest abt what’s going on, I told him I feel like he should go back up to taking at least 5 and slowly ween himself off because he doesn’t know how many he was taking and I don’t want his body going into shock. I don’t want folks thinking I’m enabling him by telling him to take more and ween, I just don’t want him to hurt himself, and he’s been getting hit by depression pretty hard. I said all of that to say, Is there any advice on coming off this by yourself, without rehab and with the help of loved ones successfully?? are there any people out here that have recovered and had/or didn’t have a support system, what would you tell someone like me? Sorry for the novel, I just want the best for him. And even though he’s still taking them, I still feel he’s back to normal (long road i know), I see hear and can feel the difference already, he hasn’t been nodding off and he’s been helpful around the house. I know it’s only been a few days but he wants to get clean, and I believe in him.",21

I really don't know much about opiates in general besides they are super addictive. For months they told me it was because of weed...and I truly believed that because I don't smoke weed. I guess you could say I am oblivious when it comes to drugs. My family members addiction started about 6 months ago. They attended rehab for a little under 2 months and relapsed immediately for about 3 weeks and is now back in rehab for another 2 weeks. I am worried that the depression/consequences/possible undiagnosed mental illness might just be too much when they get out in 2 weeks. Their parents stated that they have to live in a sober living house once they get out. I am looking into a longer term rehab program for them. How long is a good amount of time to really push them in the right direction? I am trying to be supportive as I can be since they feel like I am the only thing left in their lives. Thank you",1

Released because of the virus.

Got out, went back to treatment and finished up with that. Life’s great. I still have struggles. I’m still fighting 3 felony cases with multiple felonies on each one. I’m also fight 3 other misdemeanor cases with multiple charges. The judge wants to give me 3 years.

Hopefully that changes, but I don’t know. I go back to court Oct. 9th. I still struggle. I still have difficulties but if you would have told me a year ago that I’d go through everything I did and stayed clean, I would have called you crazy.

Life has its ups and downs but they can be dealt with. I’m finally happy. I finally enjoy daily living and I finally enjoy being able to struggle and triumph over it.

If anyone ever needs help or anyone to talk to, I’m always here. No judgments. No criticism. Just understand.

it honestly blows my mind that ive made it this far. everything in my life is so different now than it was when i was using

in active addiction, i lost 4 jobs back to back. now, im working as a technical support specialist and loving it

in active addiction, i failed my college classes for two years straight. now I’ve graduated and i have my bachelors degree in software development

in active addiction, i spent most of my time alone in my room smoking dope and nodding out. now im rediscovering my interests and hobbies that were buried beneath addiction for so long

in active addiction, i couldn’t ever be in the moment because i was obsessively thinking about when I could use next. now I can truly enjoy and engage with things

in active addiction, i was cheating drug tests and using dope in the bathroom at my rehab clinic. now ive completed 2 mental health IOPs and im in consistent weekly therapy

in active addiction, i was in constant physical and emotional pain. in active addiction, i cried every morning because the thought of facing another 24 hours filled me with dread.

now, I am......happy

i thought the cravings would last forever. I thought I would always be haunted by the overwhelming, obsessive desire to use. but it gets better. It gets so much better.

i used to think about fentanyl all day every day. now I think about it AT MOST once a month, and it’s so fleeting and easy to dismiss.

the cravings are almost nonexistent now. on September 27 2019, I decided that I was done being a slave to fentanyl

today on September 27 2020, I have stuck to that decision.

everything in my life is better now, and there is no greater misery than the hell i had to overcome to get here. i have never known such pain, such agony and desperation and hopelessness until I found that white powder. addiction is such a powerful and terrifying thing. it consumed every facet of my life, heart, mind and soul. it destroyed me, and putting back together the pieces of myself that it shattered has been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to face.

my worst days in sobriety are heaven compared to my best days in active addiction.

my life is mine again. and despite everything, i move forward.

2020-09-27 15:20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/j0x20b/boyfriend_off_methadone_for_10_days_depression/,"Boyfriend off methadone for 10 days, depression back in full swing","TL;DR my boyfriend is in a depressive spiral now after some good progress was made. I dont know what to do or how long it will last. What are your experiences detoxing from methadone?


Hi everyone. I guess I won't go into too much detail about everything that lead up to this, but basically, my boyfriend had a severe IV fentanyl addiction in 2019, and it was traumatic. But we pulled through and managed to get him enough money for a beater car so he could start driving 40 minutes, 6 days a week to the nearest methadone clinic. He was on 150mg of methadone for a year. By the end he only had to go once a week to take home his doses. 

About a month ago he quit his job that he absolutely despised, after he sold one of his leather jackets that was more than enough to cover rent. Only thing is that the $77 a week for methadone would be falling on me if he couldn't scrape it together. He didn't like that. This happened for about 3 weeks before he suddenly told me one day that he didn't go get his doses for the week, and he's not planning on going back.

This initially freaked me the fuck out. When he went through fentanyl withdrawals last year, he was so inconsolable and in so much pain, and insisted *so* emphatically that he's going to jump in front of a train that I was afraid either I or a neighbor would end up calling 911.

But days after quitting methadone, that never came. He was mildly sick, but it was a breeze and made us feel like he should have quit sooner. I think he was feeling empowered and optomistic about making that change in his life, and not worrying about the $308/month for methadone is a relief. 

But its been 10 days now, and he's absolutely fucking morose. I know that thats to be expected, since there's no methadone to balance out his brain chemicals.

 Today he won't stop talking about how he has nothing to do, ever [he shoots every suggestion down], he has no friends, nobody would hire him because he's a class 1 felon and any jobs he's able to get are degrading like foodservice, he doesn't want to do shit he hates doing, going nowhere and living a boring, depressing life just to pay rent to a shithole. 

This kind of talk reminds me alot of when he was withdrawing on fentanyl [Though not to discount the role that poverty plays in his unhappiness].

I guess what I'm trying to say is... is this going to get better? Is he still basically in the detox process, and the depressive spiral will slightly let up soon? Or should I expect he'll be  debilitated by depression and suicidal indefinitely?

I've been with him for so long and helped him every step of the way because I don't want to lose him to suicide. Im not sure what to do other than keep trying to make sure he eats and gets out of bed every day until hopefully he comes out of it. Hes pretty resistant to the idea of professional help right now.

If you've gotten clean off of methadone after a dope addiction, what was it like?",1

And when does my heart stop pounding so much after doing the smallest thing. When i was detoxing I couldn’t even get out of my bathtub I was so out of breath. It was insane I was like wtf. But I’m just gonna push through it.",3

""I encountered five snakes on this trail.  Five.  Each slithered by my feet unexpectedly and startled me, but never scared me.  Of my fears, non-venomous snakes have never been one of them.  In fact they captivate me.  I like the way they move, and that they're kind of an underdog.  Mostly I like what they symbolize:  how they \*shed their skin in order to grow.\* What better time for this reminder than fall?

Autumn is not just the time for change, but the time for detachment:  for leaves to fall, for letting go of things that no longer serve a purpose.  Even if they once did.  We all have one - something we're holding onto that is holding us back.  It may be an irrational fear, a negative pattern of thinking, a toxic relationship, bad habit, resentment, worry, or some aspect of our identity that no longer really feels like us.

Letting go is hard.

Sometimes we feel so attached to these things they start to feel like part of us, and the idea of losing them can be frightening.   Consider that thing that's holding \*YOU\* back.  Consider if it were to be released like the dead leaves of Autumn, or rather shed like a too-tight layer of skin.  Just think of how much bigger you might be when you emerge.""",12

I'm trying to help a friend switch to subs after having a terrible experience from methadone. 

She's been on 100mg daily for about 6 months. She has NO energy and is so depressed. She has to go EVERY DAY to dose and if she misses the time window she's just SOL for the day. This mimics the routine of buying dope and is not sustainable for long term recovery. 

I, on the other hand, am on subs going on 4 months, 8mg daily. I have weekly take homes and my clinic is awesome and I love the people who work there, they don't ""hate addicts"" as she said her clinic - the workers all talk shit about each other and the patients openly.

Anyways, just trying to get her to make the switch. It seems like I've been able to go back to life as I knew it and she's having a hard time maintaining for reasons due to complications from her  mmt. 

Any experience you're willing to share? Anything from the peanut gallery?

I love you guys, you have all helped me so much. Now it's time for me to help other ppl 🤍",3

I hate relying on tobacco now that I'm slowly getting clean. Just don't want to jump to another addiction. Thinking back, I've been addicted to tobacco since I was 13. It was not till 5 years later since I started Heroin but I think that was the gateway for My Chemical Romance. Pardon the bad pun.

A sickening dependency where you convince yourself absolutely sure that you can't function without *Something*. Yeah, I know. As all of you do too.

Now as I try to distance myself from these 7 years I can't help but feel nihilistic in my attempts. Can't seem to shake off that self-induced delusion of everything being Alright. A by product of Drug addiction.

I tapered off of my usually daily dose over the course of 2 weeks, just halfing my dosage every day or two and pushing myself to go as long as I could between using. The 3rd week I forced myself to only use one time every 24 hours and would take as little as I possibly could to allow myself to sleep. The last 5 days without using at all have been difficult, but manageable, and much less intense than any of my previous attempts at getting clean. Ive been using liposomal vitamin c along with gabapentin, and a very small dose of kratom (like 1 or 2g a day) in the evening if I'm unable to sleep. Ive been mentally ready to stop taking this poison for at least 6 months, but feared the insomnia and overall shitty WD symptoms, now that I am slowly starting to feel better I only wish I had done it sooner. This sub has been a Godsend, I honestly believe it has saved my life... Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for that. I'm going to be traveling back home to California in the next week or two to visit my father whom I haven't seen in almost 2 years due to my addiction and depression issues, Im so excited to see him again and that I will be clean when I do. No matter what stage of your recovery you are in right now, just keep fighting and if you slip up, own that shit and get right back in the fight. Its not easy to stay clean, but it is so worth it.

2020-09-26 04:35:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/j02hao/naltrexone_rapid_detox/,Naltrexone Rapid Detox.,"I’m an alcoholic/opiate addict. I occasionally useprescribed benzos  for anxiety. I’ve been to inpatient rehab once about a year ago. Made it 10 months clean and then relapsed hard and was using more than I was before I went to inpatient. I’ve never IV’d just smoke black (gram a day)and drink probably a 30 pack or more a dayI’m at a point where I was offered a good job and knew I had to get clean. Anyway, there’s my background/setup. 

Yesterday I got the grand idea that I could rapidly detox off both alcohol and black in a day or so rather than a few weeks of symptoms. I smoked about a half gram black and had been drinking all day. At about 3AM once I was sobering up, barely, I popped a 50mg naltrexone. 

Holy fuck was that a mistake. Within 15 minutes my body was on fire. Instantly I started vomiting nothing but beer and stomach acid. When it first hit I literally vomited so hard I shit my pants. Bound to the toilet holding a garbage can lasted for about an hour. Then my skin was crawling, vision blurred, heart racing. I took a 2mg Xanax to help with my heart racing. I went to my dark room which is just a bed with blacked out windows and a weighted blanket. After an hour I fell asleep. Woke up on and off every 30 min. Took 50mg of hydroxyzine and Librium and passed the fuck out. Woke up 12 hours later feeling 75% normal. 

Honestly I still have cravings for black but not alcohol. The main plan was to continually keep taking naltrexone daily, but after that I’m scared to take another because I don’t know if all the alcohol/black is out of my system.  I’m approaching the 24 hour mark and feel pretty okay really. But I’d rather be waterboarded or tortured than deal with that feeling of 3 weeks of withdrawal compressed into half a day.",2

I drove 2.5 hrs away to hold up in a hotel (my dealer lives near me). I have comfort meds, suboxone, and can work from my computer while the office is closed for coronavirus. I made it 36 hrs and gave in to cravings.

Drove back at midnight and was so tired coming back to the hotel I just slept for 3 hours at a rest stop. Now I have to start over again. Should be able to get through work today without being sick, and tomorrow is less important for work schedule wise. I’m booked here until Saturday. Only $40 left after this until payday on the 1st. 

I was afraid to take the subs because of potential precipitated withdrawals from fentadope. All I could put down yesterday was 2 slices of bread and a banana even though I was so hungry.

I feel like such an idiot. I don’t have another chance at this. I need to make it and have done it in the past in worse circumstances but it’s so fucking hard this time idk why. For the past 7 months every week I’d tell myself I’m going to quit. Many half assed attempts to quit and wasting money not buying bulk in direct at wholesale. It’s not like I just said “fuck it, I’m going to run with this for awhile.” I’ve been miserable this whole time. 

I hate myself for falling back into this in the first place and all the problems and pain it’s caused me to suffer again. I’ve had multiple year long periods of sobriety in the past. The worst is after 2 weeks on this run I was clean for 5 days and then used because I didn’t want to go into work sick. I think this job and my ex gf are the reasons I relapsed. I don’t talk to her anymore and I’m very close to landing a less stressful job.

I just want it to be over with so I can live my life again. I’m going to have to live like a spartan if I want any chance of rebuilding my finances which are completely gone at this point.

So I’ve been using east cost powder for over a year now. 4 days ago was my last dose and I’ve been taking kratom to deal with withdrawal symptoms. (Which was working very well.) Well, until last night. Instead of my nightly capsules I took about 2mg of suboxone. Everyone online said kratom would never cause precipitated withdrawal, but dear god did I go through hell last night. It go so bad that I took a huge dose of kratom to help but that obviously did nothing. Was it just the fent still in my fat or what?  -  and starting today I have work so I’m not sure if I’m in the clear to take subs today or if I should stick to kratom. Thanks guys.",0

2020-09-24 00:14:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/iyq70l/3_months_clean_after_relapse/,3 months clean after relapse,"Long story short - pills to freebasing H to trying to ‘chip’ by cycling sobriety, kratom and shitty relapses. My body/mind got to the point where even with months clean, I’d go into mild withdrawals with less than 72 hours of using if I stopped for longer than 12-18 hours. 

Anyways. I had a shitty on and off use period that ended 3 months ago. The stress surrounding this year broke a 2 year streak of no opiate use. It was a bummer, but I walked away and haven’t really felt the urge at all and have been active in my social life + exercise. 

It’s truly weird what they say about how using opiates dulls you. Sex, friendship, work, hobbies - you don’t need to seek things that make your life whole if all you brain craves is opiates. For those brief moments of euphoria, I wasn’t a ‘better version of myself’ - I was just fucked up and didn’t care. The better version always comes out when I’m sober and putting in the work.

Anyways, thanks for being a resource here for people to look for while on the path out of opiate addiction. Thank you and hope anyone struggling reads this. Being able to feel and make progress instead of numb and staying ‘comfortable’ is worth the agony of getting sober ImO",48

2020-09-22 18:26:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ixxsbq/milestone/,Milestone,"I’ve been wanting to write a sort of testimony here for a while, in a weeks time I’ll be 7 months clean from heroin, meth and all other drugs. I’ve just come out of 6 months of rehab and I’m about to go to a sober living house. 

I’ve been struggling with addiction for the better part of 10 years. My father was a morbid alcoholic, as was his father, but found recovery 13 years ago and has been sober ever since. 

I live in South Africa, it’s a beautiful country but it struggles in many ways. I live on the East Coast, where the heroin comes from Mozambique which gets it straight from the Middle East. Heroin costs R20 (less than 1USD) for a bag (0.1g). It’s a true problem here. 

I started smoking weed when I was like 12, and when I was 15 I started smoking mandrax(methaqualone). Mandrax, by the street name buttons, are very common here. I loved them, and still used them throughout my addiction. By the time I was 17 I was smoking heroin and at 19 after my first rehab I was injecting it, over the next few years I also started smoking crack before I found meth which I also started shooting. 

The classic thing followed, I became estranged from my loving family, got arrested, spent time on and off the streets and went to many rehabs. I never lasted long. 

Anyway, about 2 years ago I needed a change, I moved to the opposite side of the country, from Durban to Cape Town. I got a job and was living in a half way house. Things were going well, but then I started fooling around with a woman I met there and we ended up using together and got kicked out. 

She was very wealthy, she was from Lebanon and had an inheritance of US dollars. We lived the high life for months, staying in an expensive place and using a lot of heroin and crystal. She was a coke addict but I got her onto heroin and crystal. She was such a beautiful, sensitive girl and I took advantage of her. She fell pregnant and went home, I went to stay with a mate for a while but he got sick of my shenanigans and kicked me out. I was living in my car in a city I didn’t know. I got Rachelle to send me money through western union telling her that I was setting up a place for us and the baby, she had gotten clean, scared straight from her few months on hard drugs. 

Living on the streets in Africa as a white heroin addict is intense. You look very sus and you’re a target. I managed for a while, deluding myself that I’d sort things out. I was robbed, beaten and held at gunpoint. I started performing sexual favors for money, when I was flush I’d pay to sleep in an underground parking lot where I’d be safe. My cars windows were broken from a hijacking attempt. I weighed 57kg at 6’1”. I was reusing the same bent, blunt rig for days at a time. Not sleeping or washing etc.. somewhere in this haze my dad came to try find me, he thought that I was still living and working from the sober house and when he heard id left months ago he came to try find me. 

He did, he used a connection of his to use traffic cameras to trace my license plate, got my general vicinity and found me. Which was still like a needle in a haystack because I didn’t stay in one place for too long. When he found me he was full of tears, at the shock of seeing the state I was in and of gratitude that I was alive. I didn’t appreciate this, I manipulated him for money saying that I wanted to get a place to sleep for a while and then disappeared and didn’t think twice of it. 

Another month passed and I got arrested for theft and possession. I had priors and knew that I was gonna have to face time in the notorious Poulsmore prison. A real third world jail. My call was to my dad who somehow organized a lawyer who got me off if I went to rehab. 

I went to this upmarket place in Cape Town for 2 months, a beautiful place on the beach that was very expensive. This was my 6th time in rehab. I went there straight from jail and arrived broken. I stayed 2 months where I got my health back, got on methadone etc.. I also met an amazing girl there and I was feeling like myself again. 

I arranged to go see my family when I got out in Durban. Before I left the staff on duty gave me the balance of my medical fund in cash (about R1500). My parents thought that after the rock bottom I hit I would be a changed man. 

As I arrived at my parents house I knew what was gonna happen, I asked to borrow the car to buy smokes, they reluctantly agreed, and I went and copped h and some points and a button. I couldn’t even wait to get home and got high in the car. My parents were distraught and told me to leave. My car was in impound in Cape Town after the arrest so I left on foot. I lived roughly for a week then I got abbey to pay for a plane to Cape Town. 

I went to stay with her for a bit, but she was serious about staying clean so it didn’t last. I did manage to get my car back though, so it was back in my car in Cape Town. Insanely i was right back where I was. 

Another month like this, I had no ID, no clothes and was serving a suspended sentence so if a got arrested I was fucked. The same shit that happened on the streets happened. The clincher was when I tried to steal this guys bag while he was at the ATM, I was tweaking and delusional. I tried to grab his bag while he was drawing money but as I grabbed it he hit me with his motorcycle helmet, I went down and he beat me badly. All I could think about was him phoning the police. He didn’t though, he was cool once he calmed down. I still see it as a higher power in my life that he was a recovering addict. He let me use his phone. 

This was it, I’ve left out a lot of details as to how I was feeling because it’s so hard to explain. But at this moment I needed to be safe, I wanted nothing more than a safe bed, food and a clear head. My parents said that they would pay for treatment, but it’d have to be long term and nothing fancy. 

I went to a place in Mpumalanga, near the Kruger national park. It was like a farm. It was here with the help of the community and my counselor that I found myself. Confronted my trauma, worked the steps properly and accepted defeat. 

I went there at 55kg, I’m 95kg now and I’m strong. I’m hygienic, I’m no longer consumed by the need to escape. 

It’s still a struggle, I’ve got to go through the daunting process of picking up such a broken life. I’m on 2mg of suboxone and that’s it. No other drugs. 

I’m over 6 months clean for the first time since I was 15. 

There’s so much more I wanted to say, this was just last few years leading up to where I am now. As you all know, similar chaos made up all the other years leading up to it. 

One day at a time. I’m so fucking grateful to be clean. 

Thanks for whoever made it this far.",25
2020-09-22 18:11:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ixxivb/relapsed/,Relapsed,"I went to rehab and did medically monitored detox and left early (I only stayed a week) against medical advice and the advice of my family thinking I was okay and good to go. I kept thinking I could do it just one time when I got home and I’d be fine. I should have thrown out everything before I went. I still had a little bit and had my nectar collector (I only smoke it) and other drug paraphernalia. Now it’s a little over a month later and here I am back where I was before I went. As I was on the second day of doing it, I came up with a plan I’d quit before I’d feel any type of sickness. On day 3 that was supposed to be the day, but then it went to day 5. As I’m on day 5 and for the first time sober enough, I realize it was day 6 and I knew I would feel at least somewhat sick no matter what. I don’t know if it matters the amount of days you use, I assume it does but I could be wrong. I don’t know if I’d have felt just as sick as I would now but I can’t stand to feel it at all. That’s what has stopped me from quitting is that horrible sickness. It was different in rehab because I had meds preventing me from feeling it. I tried to stop that day I got to 7 hours before my anxiety was through the roof I couldn’t sit still, I was feeling sick already, I couldn’t sleep, I just felt shitty. I decided to take a small hit to feel a little bit better. 3 hours later, I am already taking another hit to feel a little more better. By the afternoon I said fuck it and stopped trying all together. The difference between now and pre rehab, is I can’t afford the drug anymore. I was able to fund my $260 every couple of days habit for months because I got lucky raiding my grandma’s house looking for things to sell by finding gold I took to the cash for gold place and getting a couple thousand. And that happened at least 4 times - I’d just keep getting lucky finding gold jewelry or I even sold my grandfather’s medal (I don’t know if it was from the war or something else but it was gold) until the last time I went to her house and there was no more gold, I found that she had silverware that was actual silver and took that and made $600. With the last of that money I got a sack that I decided would be my last. My mom even put me on an expensive insurance just for rehab even though she can’t really afford it. Now I’m struggling to get money together so bad. I’ve been selling everything I possibly can. I already didn’t have much left that I didn’t already sell besides things I didn’t want to part with that I have had to now. I don’t know why I’m so stupid. Yeah it was only a week in rehab but that was still one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. And I threw it all away. And everyone and I mean EVERYONE told me I was going to relapse and I just proved them right. My tolerance is so high I smoke about 2 grams per day. I have come close to slamming it before but knew the day I did that would be the point of no return and that soon enough I’d finally push my body to the point where I OD. And I’m thankful I never went through with that because I don’t think I’d be here writing this. I’ve been doing it since May 2019 so over a year and it’s to the point where smoking it no longer gives me the high I want and it takes so much to feel anything from it at all. I’m finally having a relationship with my mom again and she keeps saying how she’s so proud and happy to have her daughter back as I’m lying straight to her face. She’s going to be so disappointed. I was planning on going back to rehab after I got my wisdom teeth out and healed which would have been last week but I live in California and had a friend I met in rehab that texted me saying they got out early because of the fires going on (the rehab is up in the mountains) and so I don’t know if I can even go back now. I hate this drug I don’t even know why I wanted to do it again even just one time. My mom is going to be so disappointed, my whole family is. I have to go through all of the detoxing again now. I looked on the rehab’s Facebook that I went to and it didn’t say anything anywhere about being shut down. I have been meaning to text the lady that helped me get in to see but I just don’t want to have to go through it again or admit to myself that I failed. Sorry this is long if anyone even reads all of it haha.",1

Nope, no ending that’s right

When you’re hit with something, you have been hit 

When you’re waiting for the enemy, you have been missed

But that in between feeling of when the bullet is piercing through you. 

Ripping through your flesh your bones, your skin, your mind, your cells and everything in between. 

Pause that feeling. 

Now feel it again and again.

Except...

Know that it won’t end. 

At least the devil knows. He is laughing because he “gotcha”

And others laugh too. 

There’s the devil in me too that laughs at myself. 

Why me. 

Cos it had to be. Now fucking deal with it. 

Except. Remember that it may never end. 

It sure feels like it won’t. 

And you have been here before. Made it out alive? 

I didn’t think so. 

Don’t look around you. They don’t have the answer. You don’t either. 

Scream all you want

Cry all you want 

It is here to stay. Feel that bullet. 

Feel it again. 

Now make it home. Because that’s where you are going to stay for a while. 

Get used to laughing. Because you won’t find anything funny about anything for a while. 

Take every sickness you have had and multiply it by infinity. 

Infinity of pain and suffering that is

Welcome to hell. You’re here alone. 

No one can hear you.

Two months ago I jumped off a 10 year opiate habit and a 14 year benzo habit all at once. It was methadone and 1mg klonopin a day but I was done binging the methadone to get fucked up. 

If I can get high, I will do it. I don’t want to be near it

I made it 60 days clean. It was fucking hard. But I was still in pain. I had days I couldn’t walk straight and everything hurt physically. Not daily but it didn’t “end” at day 30. It got significantly better but to me it was just not an accomplishment to suffer while clean as well. 

So I relapsed hard. Self medicated for 3 weeks on an overdose of opiates and almost got arrested/killed. 

Now the kick is too hard because I was just there. And I don’t want another 60 days just to be in pain after that TOO. 

So I’m on 1 MG suboxone a day with 1 MG of Xanax a day at night so my jaw won’t shake and I can sleep. My jaw will chatter me nuts otherwise. 

A friend said. Do it slow. Take it easy. And then wean off. The problem is I never got to 60 day’s clean this way. However I realize I have chronic pain. I’m a father. A husband. A hard worker in corporate America. I am selling and buying a home. I’m one of those addicts. So I’m fucking responsible when I need to be and I can’t let my family down or worse be humiliated by not providing them. 

What do you guys say. Have you guys gotten off the slow way. The methadone clinic in Minneapolis has a 3 month wait and I’m afraid of methadone. Suboxone just keeps me able to work. The Benzos allow me to keep a paycheck. 

I have no desire to abuse either. I love methadone. Since I hate suboxone it’s not an issue of abuse. 

It’s an issue of have most of you succeeded cold turkey or wean off. 

I have a split personality. One side is a badass who jumps in front of a machine gun in war. 

The other side bunkers down and waits. 

I haven’t tried the latter. It’s too slow. I’m too impatient. 

But I have to produce for my family. My wife needs my help. My son needs me. 

People need me 

I can fuck my life.  My mind. My body. But I cannot bear abusing others I love. 

I have a self loving issue. That’s for another day. 

Yes I believe in God but we are logical and scientific people as well. 

True experiences are greatly welcomed. 

Greatly. 

Thanks again 🙏",1

Sorry this is so long and confusing and all over the place

So my boyfriend and I have been clean off heroin and meth (heroin was our main DOC) for almost 3 months. I’ve been on methadone for about two years(unfortunately) also pls don’t give me hate, I know people believe I am not completely sober while on methadone but it is the one thing helping my cravings. And I am currently tApering off.anyways, so methadone is how I got clean and he went to treatment in Florida and we live in wa state.  He was doing really well in treatment and was happy. And was still happy and doing well for a couple weeks after being back home. Then eventually he started having trouble sleeping, or maybe right when he got home from treatment I don’t remember. So the trouble sleeping started to give him cravings. He started to be depressed again as he got back into his routine of work, eat, sleep, exercise. He has not been happy since. He does have good days but mostly bad. He just told me today that he has been using for the past week. Mind you we just got our first apartment together after living with my grandparents for the past two and a half years. He thinks that he will never be happy since he has tried so many things to be clean and nothing has worked. He says he is only happy when he’s getting high. I try to remind him of how it was right before he went to treatment, and though you may be happy now, a month from now you’re going to fucking hate your life again. He doesn’t want to do anything. He just seems hopeless. He says he loves me and wants to make it work but he doesn’t. He wants to get high more and he said that. My heart is crushed. I know he needs to be happy before we can try again. I asked him to please, PLEASE find a sponsor (but he hates NA meetings and nothing is in person at the moment), and try to at least do one NA meeting on zoom to hear people’s success stories and to give him hope. I asked him to also please get a therapist and try to get an opinion and to also possibly get on depression meds. And I asked him to get on vivitrol. He was on methadone in the past but it didn’t help at all. He does not want to be on anything like subs or methadone because he wants to be sober off everything if he is clean. I am not asking him to do these things for us, I want him to do it for him. Even if we don’t work out, I want him to be happy more than anything. I love him more than life, he is my person, my dude, my best fucking friend. This will be the biggest loss I’ve ever had. I have never been in this long of a relationship and have never gotten along with somebody so incredibly well before and have never felt so comfortable. But our relationship sucks. And he is so unhappy. I am unhappy most days. Idk. Sorry this post is everywhere, I need help. I don’t know what to do. Please help. Advice please, please don’t hate on me, I’m very fragile and heartbroken and honestly am completely numb and feel like I’m dreaming because of this happening. Thanks",6

I began with alcohol then ocassional weed then a 3 month period where i used dxm 1-2x a week then i became a daily stoner in 2017(i was born 2000 so i was 17 yo). I had my first opioid when i was 16/17 idk and it was tramadol. From 2016 to 2018(16-18 yo) i used tramadol 1-3x a month and didnt have many problems. Also i should mention that i have been suffering from depression for the last 10 years, i have four psychiatric diagnoses - depression anxiety ocd adhd. only the depression and adhd cause major problems for me. In march 2018 i started using the tram more often(use for a week quit for a week etc) and during summer 2018 i had my first oxy. I immediately fell in love mich more than with trams. Not even 3 months went by and i was using daily modestly physically and majorly psychologically addicted. Also suffering with hardcore depression/anhedonia(but i had that long before i first began with drugs). During late 2018 and the whole 2019 i used oxy daily using 100-500mg daily (80mg per day was enough to not be sick but if i could i would take 300+ mg, even doing 160mg in one dose). From december 2019 ive been trying to limit my use and handle my depression more. It was a long hard proces to get from 200-400mg oxy daily to 10-20g of kratomdaily. This year i took oxy like once a month and the other 29 days just kratom. Now im in a rehab/psychward and im trying to work on my issues therapeutically and stabilise my eating, sleeping, sport and also stabilise my use of lratom on 10g per day(its a really free rehab they understand i cant quit everything now) and im also trying to work out the best combo of meds to handle my depression and ideally help me taper the lratom(completely or just lowering my maintance dose). Its hard and i miss getting fucked up but compared to being totally clean from opiates i can actually live. Without the kratom(ive been clean for a month like 3 times last half year) my depression/anhedonia was just too much and life was constant pain without any pleasure but now i have the energy to try to work on myself and focus on other things than getting money and drugs. I have energy to go on walks, write lyrics play games eat semi-healthy work on my issues etc. I can actually live and not survive. Yeah i miss using harder opiates and other drugs but now its just my meds kratom nicotine and caffeine for me. I dont get majorly high but i dont have that unbearable amount of pain and suffering as i had before drugs and when i was clean. I dont rly know what i wanted to say i guess im just ranting. Also sorry for my english its not my first language im from czech republic(central europe). I just wanna say if u have psych problems and addictions and suffer all the time that life can be better. Even if i wont be able to quit completely(which i hope ill be able to do) this life is a helluva lot better and its not just day to day surviving.",5

Hi,

Apologies in advance for the long post here. I've been addicted to codeine for quite a few years now. In Ireland where I live you can get it over the counter and I have been abusing this for quite a while and it's escalated since covid. I had also taken stronger dosage ones that my Mam had been prescribed. I wasnt always on huge doses every day but I was taking it quite regularly for a long time. To cut a long story short it I realised the dosage I had been taking had stopped working to address any physical symptoms or pain so in order to get the same feeling from it I would have to increase the dose. I made the decision to quit cold turkey and naively I underestimated how difficult this would be. I guess I figured cause it was an over the counter drug and not a street one then there wouldnt be major withdrawal. The physical symptoms were actually manageable but it's been 3 weeks since I've had codeine and my anxiety is through the roof and I feel so low. My moods are fluctuating and I have this impending sense of dread. I feel quite restless like my mind cant relax and this is making me upset when I'm around my young son as I feel I cant enjoy being around him and then that makes me feel worse. My question after all this verbal diahorrea is, is what I am experiencing here part of the withdrawal and will it go away? It's like an alien feeling like I'm perceiving the world in a nightmarish way and it's frightening me. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks all.",12

It wasn’t easy but I got through it. During this period my body started to fucking hate me obviously, and I developed a chronic pain disorder called “interstitial cystitis”.  (if you aren’t familia, it basically feels like you have a UTI or STI all the time for weeks / months on end, constant pain isn’t eh bladder and urethra, rarely giving you any relief)

Unfortunately because if the chronic pain, I used kratom and an “rc opioid” called ap 238 that no one should ever use. the kratom is fine, I could quit that with some kicking and screaming but it wouldn’t be so bad, I’ve gone a few days without it here and there. but man that ap 238... I didn’t really give it much thought. I just wanted to be pain free. 

I didn’t think it was a problem until I decided it’s not good for me and it’s stopped taking it. even with regular kratom dosing I’m going though a hellish withdrawal... vomiting, nausea, crazy anxiety, killer heartburn and cramping... yeah I’m just fucking stupid. Now I’m in pain and feel like I’m dying. 

Sorry to ramble here, this is my first time ever having an opiate withdrawal. I know i’ll get through it but if anyone has any advice I’m open for anything.

I'd love to hear comments and feedback on my positions and moral stances. Since this sub concerns recovery, you can skip to the end to learn about a highly intuitive new approach to rehabililtation.

\- - - - - - - -Cognitive liberty, including the right for one to freely ingest quantitites of drugs and psychoactive substances, is a freedom which has been long neglected and riddled with inexorable taboos and stigma in the Western world. There is no doubt that certain drugs are deleterious and can have a negative influence on individual health and financial outcomes, and that the most addictive/habit-forming classes of drugs (namely, amphetamines and opiates and their analogues), when they are abused, are capable of wreaking utter havoc and tragic devastation upon familial and professional relationships, and may even lead to overdose and death. Paradoxically, they possess the capacity to both alleviate and cause suffering.

Yet it is past time for us to acknowledge that the human history of drug use, going back thousands of years, occurs in harmony with our tendency to exploit nature and explore the vistas of consciousness. Though now drugs can be synthesized at mass industrial scale within laboratories, those substances that were first derived from plants (such as cannabis or cocaine) were originally criminalized under an explicitly and transparently racist, anti-immigrant policy.

This includes most notably the Harrison Narcotic Act (1914), the Eighteen Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (1917, otherwise known as prohibition), the Marijuana Tax Act (1937), Controlled Substances Act (1971 — which had the awful effect of effectively ending government and university-sanctioned research on psychadelics, which had already shown fantastic results in psychological therapy, for over 30 years, in a massive setback for science and medicine), and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 — which favored punishment over rehabilitation and established mandatory minimum sentences for offenses).

That policy is still carried out in America, with increasing intensity since the mid-1980s which is only recently dissipating, by armed gangs of thugs who are empowered, by unjust laws surrounding the forfeiture of property, to seize the assets of dealers―and they are termed police. They would just love to get a piece of a highly lucrative black-market economy. Yet even under the conservative, quaint and antiquated Abrahamic notions in which God gave the whole of the Earth to humanity to enjoy, the criminalization of drugs would appear to be sinful and against the will of the creator. Surprisingly, there are absolutely no express prohibitions covering these widespread behaviors outlined in the collective text called “the Bible”.

The legacy of the temperance movement and teetotalism inhibits one’s personal freedom to alter the state of their own mind. It’s especially sad for me to consider how many children were indoctrinated in the era of Nancy Reagon’s “Just Say No” slogan; wherein a whole generation growing up in the 90s was fed misleading and inaccurate scare stories alongside debunked claims and urban myths about drugs — and were thus dissuaded from exploring the possibilities and the ways in which drugs can enrich and lead to greater enjoyment and quality of life. I’d like to imagine that perhaps some were made even more curious by the D.A.R.E. campaigns and went on to become pharmacologists. In any event, numerous professionals and successful or notable individuals throughout history have attested and provided anecdotal evidence of the positive, enhancing effects of drugs, in contrast to the negative effects which are emphasized by public health campaigns.

While the police benefit from the War on Drugs and people are killed or displaced by violence between rival cartels, the pharmaceutical industry also profits handsomely, driven by the voracious appetite of Americans, whose drug consumption patterns exceed those of any other civilized country. What were once niche tastes, via the spread of information and the rise of the global economy, have reached epidemic levels. Answering the question of why people take drugs is deceptively simple: because they are pleasurable. Other factors exist of course; peer pressure is real, as is pressure exerted by literary and musical precedent, e.g. the history of writers, jazz & rock musicians, scientists, inventors and cultural luminaries who have partaken of various drugs and were in many cases inspired by their experiences under the influence.

Childhood trauma might as well be a determining factor.

A path towards further decriminalization along with a recognition or acknowledgement of the human rights of drug users — which have long been ignored and infringed upon — along with better education and rehabilitation options — for the millions of educated, responsible users, is sorely needed within this century. Moreover, I would hope to witness research and medical discoveries within my lifetime rooted in eradicting the withdrawal syndrome.

I would suggest that it’s irresponsible and corrupt for such people as legislators, physicians, and the police to influence national drug policy without having tried taking the substance(s) at hand. The idea that what we put into our bodies is our liberty as human beings is a classical libertarian dogma that exerts far more power and elegance than even the mildest prohibition.

In modern America, or at least during the period when I attended K-12 school, becoming initiated and familiar in the usage of certain illicit drugs, e.g. an underground clique and society which begins to exist identifiably between the ages of 16 and 21, is a common ritual feature of the adolescent entering adulthood. Strikingly, the fact that the drugs are legally prohibited forms a large part of their appeal to young and rebellious minds that are skeptical of authority by nature. It’s been documented by several studies that in tandem with decriminalization, recreational and problematic usage actually decreases.

The current “rehab” industry is a sham and a racket, exploiting the vulnerable class of habitual drug users. They are commonly not evidence or science-based, and are filled with all sorts of quackery. Widely-followed methods such as AA or 12-step have not been shown to be effective at all. The notion that someone might need rehabilitation from their drug habit, to me, is usually based on a flawed notion that there is anything fundamentally “wrong” with their consumption in the first place. Users are frequently pressured into these circumstances against their will, in so-called interventions. The choice to live a drug-free and sober life might be seen as noble, but I would challenge any proposition that the alternative choice of being a “psychonaut” or becoming an addict, alcoholic or junkie―a process which some people, especially those with a background in the arts and sciences, evidently take up with enthusiasm based upon a rich cultural tradition―is ignoble or a mark of defective character as such.

In fact, it can be argued that an individual’s drug history and experiences can be an asset. The role of drug-related interactions and experiences as a mediator of ill repute, or a criteria of poor performance, leading to shunning by society, *must* treated skeptically. After all, as with adherents to religion, it’s abusers who give moderate users a bad name. History shows that many drug addicts have been conceivably possessed of incredible talent, intelligence or genius, and are otherwise capable of leading normal, fulfilling lives.

For anyone considering a stay in rehablitation, or even out-patient treatment for their substance abuse, I would recommend a book and methodology called [The Freedom Model](https://www.thefreedommodel.org/) which makes the anti-rehab argument quite persuasively. The drug issue is at its heart a question of liberty, and our absolute freedom in this regard is something we must not compromise.",5

Just a little motivation.,"That's my clean time right now. 1 year and 9 months ago I overdosed in front of my infant son. It was the worst thing that has ever happened to my life. After years of denying rehab because I couldn't face the shame, I realized there is nothing to be ashamed of. Anything I can do to better my life is worth it and who the fuck cares who judges that? They're the assholes.

I did have vivitrol. Without it, I would never have stayed clean through my mom's alcoholism, her crippling health issues and finally her death. I never would've got out of my homeless status. I wouldn't be in school right now. I wouldn't be at peace with myself.

I stopped vivitrol a few months ago and I am still okay. I have no interest in using. But, this is my story and my success. Yours is what you make of it.

You will never get sober if you feel shitty sober. The success to sobriety isn't in what you can replace it with. It is being able to stop during the days you're down or up and being able to say ""I like this, this is better than being high"". It's also being able to understand triggers, both with drugs and also just in your fucking life. It's being able not to have to lie every single day in your life and recognizing who you are.

DO NOT be ashamed. Do not feel like a dick because you're on MAT. There's no shame in Suboxone, Methadone or Vivitrol because it is getting you through the day without potentially dying or hurting yourself or others. Doing anything sober that betters yourself is worth it. Thanks for listening to my TED talk.",38

What I'm wondering is has anyone ever heard of shit cut with lorazepam? And can I have a false negative test result? I'm thinking someone may have gotten my UA or something mixed up?

I'm going to get another opinion on the hep c but I can't find out about the cut unless I pick up and test it. And I can't/won't do that lol.

I have considered jumping off at 210 but i think this will be tough, i jumped off my old (300-700) dose a few months ago, CT, and it was hell on earth, i relapsed at day 8

So i’m thinking to drop again, to 120mg, have more mild wds, and jump of that after around 2 weeks when stabilised.. i don’t mind some withdrawals (have comfort meds).. just not horrific ones as before! Will this mean the wds will be ‘equivalent’ to that dose? 

Also currently i am taking 120mg in the morning and 90mg in the afternoon, when i drop to 120 should i split the dose again or just lose the afternoon dose, i know this will bring on pretty horrific evening withdrawals to begin with but it might be a better strategy for the eventual jump, and daytimes will be normal for me too.

I read a lot of posts but couldn’t find a specific answer because most of the recommendations are about active withdrawal and mood issues
But I don’t have a big problem with my mood.. 

So it really is insomnia through restlessness every 1.5-2 hours and maybe a low motivation!

As far as I read Blackseed oil and melatonin could be helpful?
Can you recommend other stuff?

I also have 5htp and sam-e and take multi vitamins, magnesium and Kalium!
Is is very important which kind of magnesium I’m taking?

The craving for opiates has never been so intense.  It seems like after the month and a week of feeling like I was literally dying... ending.... has made my craving for opiates increase 10x.  I've been through fucking hell for this past month and a week, and now I'm hit with feeling way better but craaaaving.  Feels manic.

I don't know what to fucking do.",3

Honestly, I was so sure that I would spend the rest of my days living the hell that is opiate addiction. Sometimes I think maybe I nodded off and I’m just having a really pleasant dream for once. And the thought of waking up from this brings me crippling anxiety. 

In my eyes, this is my biggest accomplishment in life thus far. Every single day is a struggle. But every day is no longer a struggle to get well. No more waking up every day and having a good 30 min to hour long cry because I didn’t die in my sleep... but woke up, yet again, in my hellish nightmare of a life. No more excuses/lies to bosses and coworkers about the “stomach bug” I came down with again, but “I’m feeling much better than I look!” because dope sick was not something I considered a worthy reason for me calling out sick. No more struggling to hide the fact that I was 115lbs at 5’11 by layering 2 pairs of leggings under my jeans and at least 3 shirts and a hoodie under my coat. I wasn’t fooling anyone but the shock and pain in people’s eyes when they saw me without all the layers... somehow always caught me off guard. 

“One. Day. At. A. Time.” My mom drilled this into my head all day, every day for that first year. I still repeat it to myself daily. That’s all I can do, get through this day and I’ll have one more day of freedom to look forward to.  

I’m far from perfect and have other issues/addictions to work through... but I’ve never regretted quitting heroin. Everything SUCKS right now and we’re lonely, anxious, bored... those thoughts creep back in so unexpectedly. About a year ago someone on reddit told me to read the book “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction” by Gabor Maté. I finally ordered a copy for myself and one for someone who needs it. I’ll admit, that was actually in April but I knew I would know when someone needed it. So if you’re struggling to hang on, in recovery or active addiction, the loved one of an addict... and this book might help you or someone you love in any way let me know. I’ll get it on it’s way to you 🖤",64

This is my problem and I’m hoping some of you can give me good advice on my particular situation since even my doctor doesn’t know wtf to tell me. I’ve been on opiates for 6 years, first started smoking percs and now smoke H. I’m prescribed 8mg Suboxone but like most people I’ve used that as a backup plan. Well... now they don’t work for me. I used to be able to take them 12 hours after my last use and I’d be good. The last time I tried to take it I waited 48 hours and it made me feel 10x worse. My goal in this is to get back on my subs bc I don’t feel comfortable in sobriety just yet but want it more than anything but my family doesn’t know about my addiction so I feel subs is the best for me rn. Once I’m back on them successfully I want to start going to therapy and doing the work to be sober. With all that said please leave me your tips and tricks to help make withdrawal even 10% better.

Please hang in there whatever your battle is.,"If I can do this so can you, the first 4 days were by far the worst days of my life. I’m such a weak and impulsive person, day 3 I messaged my plug to bring some but his car genuinely broke down midway and he said he’d do it in a few hours. I took this as a sign and blocked him.

Day 6 now I’m gonna see if I can sleep better, after getting no sleep for the first 4 days I managed 4 hours last night so we’ll see if I get some more today.

Went for a few walks, and to a restaurant with my friends today and got a natural euphoria I haven’t experienced in ages, I can’t describe that feeling today. Music has been sounding better. First time in so long I feel excited to go to work, interact with people. I know there’s gonna be bad days when I feel like shit but that’s life, opioids give us the illusion that you can always feel good but that’s now how life goes, without them though the good days feel a million times better. 

Usually end of the day I smoke weed, completely stopped for 6 months just because how hooked my body was on pills. But I missed this little flower so much, should’ve never dropped it for percs. Just gives me nice clarity on life, and makes it easier to relax without stressing about other symptoms. I recommend a nice Indica after 9 PM, hits great.


I’m still not at my best, the sleep schedule and my energy still isn’t quite there but I can feel both getting better everyday. 

Only medication or other drugs I used were Weed, Sleep Pills and Ibuprofen 

Hang in there guys, no matter how shitty it feels on those first few days please stay strong or you’re back to square one. If I can do this anyone can.",10

Woke up the following morning ( today ) and the cough and cold was still there, so I took 2 50mg tramadol, 2 30mg dehydracodiene and 2 30mg/500mg cocodamol.
Then took another 4 tramadol throughout today.

I feel like ive let myself down. I didnt NEED them, I told myself it was okay to do so because I was ill.

And then as soon as I've done the withdrawal the voice in the back of my head comes back. Does anyone have any advice on dealing with these thoughts?

I would probably use. I'm dreading having money but longing for some basics too. Oh! Baths and showers help a lot. They stop the thrashing about for a little while. Changed my bed covers.

I've not had any of the negative side effects from it, and have only realized the benefits it does for me.   I will say this, you have to be ready, willing, and WANTING to be done for it to have it's most beneficial effects transpire in your life.

I have noticed a influx of people using especially with everything going on right now. I have been down a very long and dark road and lost everything to drugs. My home, baby pictures, everything to the clothes on my back. I am now doing better for myself getting my GED and everything. I wan't to let you who need to hear it know, it DOES get better. Cravings for me lasted a good year before subsiding. The first year is the hardest especially if you used all day everyday. You need to get over that year and it will get better. Also if you need to I would suggest Suboxone for the cravings I actually had such bad cravings that I had to take Suboxone in order to not relapse or drink my self to death on the really hard days. Some people judge the people on the Sub/methadone but its whatever works for you. Its worth it to do that than to continue the cycle. I am currently still on Suboxone but only 4 MG daily and it helped me ALOT. I started using opiates when I was 13 daily until 21. Started with pills and then you know the rest, next thing you know IV H use.  I am now 24 so all my brain knew was drugs it didn't know anything else so I felt it was the right choice for me.

Humbled, proud, elated, and nervous. All at once.","That's it. I have a month clean. I'm like, really proud and in disbelief. I'm planning on using vivitrol for a year, maybe two, because honestly, as long as heroin exists on this planet I really can't place any confidence in my ability to abstain on my own, and I've learned that it's going to find you one way or another, some day, every. fucking. time. I've been stringing together days all year just to fall off before I'm halfway done detoxing, I think I made it through being dopesick twice but relapsed on day 2 or 3 of feeling somewhat normal. I never felt so powerless before. I've been addicted to hard drugs with varying degrees of severity/dependence since 17, but heroin really became the ONE about three years ago. This year shit got extremely real. I legitimately could not function without it. I almost lost my job, which has never even come close to happening before. So these last 30 days are extremely special to me. I wasn't sure I'd live through some days and I was genuinely okay with that as long as I was high as fuck. Does getting high sound good? At first. Then I play the tape through, fast forward in my mind to the empty bag, and then it's really not all that appealing anymore. I deserve better. I am finally realizing that, not just in my mind but in my body, the idea that I'm worth fighting for is not just a concept anymore but something I am genuinely coming to believe to be true and aligning my behaviors and actions with this principle is still something I actively have to manage with myself day to day, but it's getting easier and I know if I can keep it up then it wont be long before self-respect and care are my new normal. 

If you read this, thank you for hearing me. I appreciate you.

 I just needed to say something to people who get what this is like. I'm on the west coast and outdoors in general is not where you want to be right now so a meeting is out of the question. Right now though, for today, I'm not worried about anything but getting through the next 24 hours. One minute at a time if necessary.

Here's hoping this time it sticks and stays stuck. If you're struggling right now, if you're dopesick right now, my heart goes out to you, and I know you can do this. If I can, you can. We are all worthy of happiness and inner peace.",73

Instead of admitting I was right, he called me “nagging” and just slept all day and then every time I tried to talk to him he told me to leave him alone. I told him it hurts my feelings because he is mad at me for caring about him and wanting the best for him. He then told me I’m a hypocrite because I smoke weed, but I literally smoked my last bowl today and told my dealer I was quitting earlier this week because I want to set the best example (even though I don’t think there is any comparison between weed and H but, oh well). I hate when people are mad at me and he knows this. He told me I just need to leave him alone. It’s a really bad position he’s put me in that basically I have to allow him to do drugs or he will be mad at me and not speak to me all day.

I believe I sent myself into PWD by taking LDN on the night of day 3 of a relapse, after 7 days clean off 40mg/day for two months. Felt awful an hour after ingestion, with the emergence of chills and a headache, which lasted for about 12 hours, and then groggy the rest of the day yesterday. My chronic pain came flaring back too so I know the LDN kicked the opiates out of my system. 

But today I woke up feeling fine, even good — about where I was feeling back on Day 6/7. 

So just curious in general if going through PWD then makes the rest of the acute phase “easier.”

You have been lied to that your only options are suffer, or big pharm. Thats bullshit. As long as you stay on top of it-dosing 3-4000mgs every 2 hours during day, you will be good to go. Google the protocol. Start 2 to 3 days before you kick. Idc what any negs have to say. If you havent tried it, or done it by protocol, Im not here to listen to your rhetoric. Im here to help ppl in a tight spot, who want to get the monkey of your back. This information has been suppressed bc its cheap, unpatentable, and extremely effective.

I recently kicked 2~ months of around 40-50mgs of oxycodone a day after my condition flared up. I spent a full 7 days sober. By day 5 I had no physical symptoms like chills or RLS, just mental fatigue, mild cravings, and a headache. By day 7 I felt decent. 

Unfortunately I had an accident and my pain flared up the morning of day 8 — go figure. 

For the last four days, I have done all I could to no need to dose anything, but have taken around 25mg each day. 

I realize I’m putting myself back into a bad pattern and went and gave the rest of my meds to a trusted friend. 

My question — how fucked am I for withdrawal symptoms now? I know I likely set myself back, just wondering if I’ll be going through acutes again.

Lately I've had this horrid pain in my face, jaw and through my ear. Its a very sharp very bad pain (8/10) it's really bad in my sinuses and only on one side. 
I also have some yellow/brown pus looking stuff come out of that side when I blow my nose. Took a full course of antibiotics and steroids and no relief. It hurts so bad I can't sleep. 
Has anyone else experienced something similar? What helped? I feel like this has to be from snorting because I've never experienced anything like this at all before this.",3

I’m trying to quit opioids right now and have gotten down to using just a few times a week, I used subs minimally to get me there. Today was day 1 again and honestly, I felt great. Minor, minor anxiety and sweats. I was fine physically but weak mentally. 

I had it the fucking bag, man. All I had to do was power through a few more hours, but what did I do?? Downloaded a free texting app to get a hold of my dealer because I had her block me on her phone. How fucking pathetic. I didn’t even need it, I wasn’t sick!!! 

I ended up wasting money, lying to my partner, putting my freedom in jeopardy and hanging out in a disgusting motel room with 4 random guys BY MYSELF (I’m a female) just to score. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?!?!?!

I should have called someone, went to a meeting, went to my parents, ANYTHING but what I ended up doing. I have so so much going for me right now and I keep putting it all at risk. Why do I do this to myself?? I need to make some serious changes. I know that. I wanna jump back into a 12 step program, start therapy again and get back into fitness and nutrition. I can’t keep doing this to myself and my little family. 

Anyway, I just needed to get all this out. I want tomorrow to be different. I’m the only one that can make that happen. I want my life, not substances god dammit.",7

2020-09-11 22:31:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ir4hx9/do_you_fear_winter_as_much_as_i_do/,Do you fear winter as much as I do?,"I guess many of us have this same constant temperature sensitivity, even when stable on opioids, but most horribly during withdrawal. (While almost being numb to temperature for the few minutes/hours you're high, if you even get high anymore.)

TL,DR: My questions to you guys are:
- *What do you guys feel is the best time for detoxing?*
- *Do you dread winter as much as I do because of opiates (or the lack thereof)?*

I had carefully planned out my home detox for all this year, but kept postponing it. Now summers almost over, I haven't even realized until a few days ago - it went so fast, and it sucks and I fear the winter. Already now it's bad sometimes even though it's still around 20°C (68°F) during the day.

In winter, during withdrawal, I have to pile on clothes and blankets and as soon as I'm slightly comfortable, the next second all these layers are drenched in sweat and I'm of course lacking the strength to keep putting all this shit on and off. This is especially torturing when I have to (and while I am still able to) leave the house and enter the infinitely amplified coldness and THEN enter, for example, the train, bus or a supermarket.. ugh.

I think the real hot summer days are the best for detox, as even then I'm mostly cold, mybe also due to the minimal food intake. Sure youre sweating, but you need fewer clothes/layers of stuff overall as the creeping constant cold is not as bad or as omnipresent so it's much more easy to handle.

That is my opinion at least. My friend has the exact opposite opinion. His reasoning being that in winter he doesn't really leave the house anyway and it's more a time to just stay in bed and he despises hot weather either way.

But I found that our withdrawals are very different too, which is interesting because we take the same substance (fentanyl) in roughly the same amount and frequency. His withdrawal emphasizes more on back/bone pain, diarrhea/bowel-issues, whilst temperature-sensitivy, chills and the flashes aren't as bad by his account. I am the opposite, for me the worst are the flashes, like lighting strikes every few seconds, and the sweating & coldness. 
(RLS is not as big an issue for both of us while vomiting, sneezing, yawning, insomnia are roughly equally horrible.)

Sorry if this is really long, but i personally find it very interesting to know and maybe some of you do too.",1

I fell into opiates shortly after that, solely roxy 30s then, but discovered heroin after that and would bounce back and forth for a couple years, ending up shooting both h and the pills, before finally quitting and moving to a new city to start my career with my degree. I was good for awhile there and had that excitement of my first professional job and a girl I met down there I fell in love with, but sure enough I found a connect and would abuse oxy 80s up until I ended up moving far away to a new city for a better job offer, push my career further and finally cut all the shit. Welp, on arrival there I first of all didn’t like it compared to where I had been before, and two I instantly found a sub on here where people sold drugs lol. So completely isolated and really depressed, I was using again within a couple months. My career is really taking off and I’m not using opis daily, but I’ve got a bit deep with benzos. There’s a ton more to it, but really I’m just desperate and looking for someone to talk to that maybe has been in a similar situation before, or has had to balance a strong professional life while losing it outside of work. I’m really afraid it’s now or never for me, once winter hits I’ll only get worse if I don’t stop now. I loathe winter and it makes me depressed as is, I know if I don’t do something soon, something bad will happen.",3

I'm finally starting to feel better emotionally and physically and I know I will never go back! My question is... I withdrawaled from opiates, gabapentin, and soma! acute was HARD PAWS was HARDER. My husband's bday is coming up and I wanted to plan something special for him and that includes a bit of wine, meditation, massages, etc. I NEVER had an issue with alcohol, I would drink maybe twice a month (if that). I wonder if I drink some wine would that set me backwards? Would I experience any withdrawals? I know alcohol acts on gaba receptors, and I was withdrawaling from gabapentin and soma which also acted on those receptors, i believe.. so I'm afraid I will be thrown back into acute or something. Anybody ever had this experience?! Thank you!!

UPDATE: I had a small glass of wine yesterday, it was okay i forgot how alcohol makes you hot and it kind of brought me back to when I was hot and cold during the acutes so I had to calm myself down. But other then that it was okay, I relaxed and cooked and danced a bit. However, I need some more time for my brain to repair itself before putting any mind altering substances in my body including alcohol.

edit: thank you everyone for your responses, I’m not going to use regardless, I have many other reasons to be clean.

I’m not even sure what changed but I have the commitment now that I haven’t had since 2018. It feels great, honestly. I haven’t been clean for very long but it’s the longest stretch of time since the start of my relapse, I don’t expect my family or anyone to trust me at this point since I know it takes a very long time to gain it back, it would just be easier/make me smile if they threw out a “proud of your progress” or a high five or something but like I said, I’m okay without it. 

It just sucks that me finally doing it and them giving up happened at exactly the same time, but it is what it is and maybe it’ll change in time. I’m still a lot happier than I was when I was using. Hope you guys are all doing well :)",34

It might be trauma of some kind. We shouldn’t feel bad, ashamed, embarrassed, or guilty to have taken a substance that made us not hurt anymore. What good is shame? We’re not all masochists, anyway. If there’s a pill that takes our pain away, and we’ve felt it, and we chose *not* to take it - I think that makes us incredibly strong. We’ve felt the escapism and euphoria that drugs provide and we’re choosing to live differently. There’s something you’re enduring this pain for today. We’re choosing recovery every day because we’re choosing love. Don’t you remember feeling loved? Dancing alone with yourself in the living room when no one’s watching? You deserve to love and to feel loved, even if that means just loving yourself today. We’re here for a moment. We have eternity not to feel. Today we’re human. Today will be okay.

Initially, I wanted to post here some information on it, but this you can do on your own.

Then I wanted to show some study results from MAPS Canada. However, the statistics behind were not all that good.

So I'm afraid we're going to have to rely on anecdotal report. So anyone who ever had an ibogaine treatment to get rid of opiate addiction, would you like to share:

Where you did it?

What was the actual treatment like?

Did it help you in the long term (1 month, 6 months, 5 years) to stay off? Or did you at least manage to reduce your use significantly?

It might help fellow humans that have the same struggle as you have or had.

Bot bags. Grams. Now, pills won't even get me out of withdrawals.  I can snort 3  30mg back to back and still be puking my guts out. So here i am burning through at least 600 dollars a day and those dollars are almost gone. I got the courage to call a couple rehab places fairly close only to be told that they didn't think that they could meet my needs. 2 different people told me to go to any ER and they would assess me and refer me somewhere.  No shit. I don't have insurance and don't want to spend a grand on an ER visit, if i can help it. One of the nicer ones said that it sounded like i did need to detox in a hospital setting and that some hospitals have in house programs.  The two hospitals she suggested, i called only to find that they suspended their program indefinitely, because of covid. 

I live in East Tennessee, but am willing to travel. Does anyone know of a hospital based detox that helped them get over the hump? Somewhere in Asheville, maybe? Hell. I would drive 10 hours. 12 hours. Longer, if it meant going to a good program that would keep me reasonably comfortable through the process. I know that pain will be involved,  but a couple trazadone and imodium isn't going to work for me.

So my parents are out of town for a week and I've been watching their house. I live there anyway so I'm making it sound overly important but anyway my sister is one person I'm watching to protect it from. Nobody except my gf believes me that she has been getting high for a very long time. I am almost 7 years heroin free, but she is a very obvious drug addict to someone who has been around the block and has no choice but to be around her.

I came home this am from my girlfriends house and the door was unlocked. I hated that. I texted my sister to complain that basically that was very stupid and she needs to be more careful. After this, I notice some brown chunks and powder on the desk in the laundry room, with a card someone was using to crush it up. I took pictures and texted my very clean other sister asking what to do, all while knowing the dope sister would find a way to deny it all. To make sure it wasn't a random pill or something, I put a little on foil, called my gf and lit some to get a smell. I knew instantly that I had just found my sister's heroin. Mind you, I went to jail for 6 months in 2014 for H-possession. I smoked it when I used so I'm unfortunately very familiar with the smell and burning consistency. 

I called her to try to find out more. She said it was ""her friend's meth"" because she knows how messed up this all is with me finding it. (oh yeah, and she's pregnant with a baby that nobody has met the father of yet) It is such a mess. She threatens me in every way, saying that my mother said she could be there, that it wasn't hers, that I'm a pussy, and that she would be coming here with the police to forcibly get in the house. She then said she'd just break a window and punch me in the fkn mouth. She raged like nobody's business. Then she said to cry to someone who cares because they weren't her drugs and apparently this can happen to anyone. She made me feel horrible. I scraped up what I found, told her the door was locked, and blocked her number. I flushed it all but was on the foil and I might get an opiate test for the residue as I know she's planning her grand lies to fool everyone for the 100th time. 

I am really proud of myself and this is the first test I have passed involving an opiod that I can ever remember happening. I actually didn't think it was possible. The feeling I have from beating this thing today makes me beam with pride but also I'm worries about her, the baby, and everyone she will fool. If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it a lot.",8

I was a heroin addict, got clean and have been on Suboxone the past 7 years or so. This was my second time getting off of it, got off before back in 2012.

Methadone or ibogaine?,"So I'm now 24 and I've been addicted to opiates since age 18, heroin since age 20 and the last year or so on the needle. 

I've tried literally almost everything to stop: Rehab, 12 step meetings, suboxone, moving back into my parents house and away from the city (still managed to get my hands on dope) 

The best glimpse of clean time I've had was a couple months ago when I decided to give suboxone a shot long term rather than using it for a few days just to detox.. it worked great! For about 2 months.. I truly thought it was the answer to my addiction because it handled my cravings and made me feel normal with minimal desire to use, but after about 60 days I totally stopped feeling the effects and my cravings came back stronger than ever before and thus, I relapsed..

I've now lost my girlfriend, whom I love dearly. Next will be my job and my house if Don't kick this shit. I can still get my girl back I don't think it's too late but I have to figure something out here soon..

So I've been looking into both methadone and ibogaine.. and they appear to be my last 2 options left

Methadone, from what I've read, is much better than suboxone in terms of controlling cravings and since it has no ceiling, it won't ""stop working"" like the suboxone did. And since I was okay on suboxone during the period that it did still ""work"" then methadone might just be exactly what I need, Right??

Then there's ibogaine.. the major downside here is the hefty price tag of $9-10k but the success stories I've heard are incredible. If I had a positive life changing experience that got me off dope I would gladly pay 10 grand. I'm willing to max out my credit cards and borrow money from my parents to cover the rest if need be.

I was hoping I could get some advice from anyone who has experience with methadone and/or ibogaine. If so I would greatly appreciate it..

P.S. please do not give me the 12-step jargon about methadone just being another addiction, if being on ""just another drug"" is what it takes to get me off dope then I will gladly do it. As mentioned, Suboxone worked for me for a short period. My main priority is to just get off the dope and feel normal again",3
2020-09-08 22:32:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ip7m3e/sedation_rapid_detox_experiences/,Sedation Rapid Detox Experiences?,"I am 40yo and considering the sedation rapid detox. I've looked at a few places in Michigan and am considering Advanced Rapid Detox Center.

Can anyone share their *real* experiences? The videos sure make it look enticing and they have people at 2-3 days clean talking about how great they feel, but then when I google, I find lots of mixed answers. Some saying it doesn't work, others saying they were totally sick with PAWS and just wasted $8000 and others saying it does work.

Like how do you feel a week out? Does the vivitrol prevent craving. What about the time to restore the natural ""balance"" which no rapid detox can fix, i.e insomnia, depression, life B.S. In previous times, that's taken me 3-6 months for a lot of stuff and a year for others, and I expect that here, I just wonder how bad it will be during the first couple weeks.

Also if anyone has done the ""accelerated rapid withdrawal"" like Coleman Institute in Wellesley MA. Although, the reviews on that definitely seem like it still sucks big time.

A little backstory, I used from 15-25 and kicked cold turkey for 12+ years. Then after my divorce 3 years ago I relapsed and have been using ever since pretty consistently. I would say I do 10+ grams a day, but nowadays its really hard to know what you're doing and how much you're really doing. I do know this. I buy from Lawrence MA, which is notoriously 'stomped on', sometimes I barely get high, and will kick thinking maybe the stuff is fake, and then I don't even feel sick for over 24 hours, sometimes until around day 2. But then I do get real sick, and a few times, I've tried suboxone after 24 hours and go into INSANE acute w/d. To the point I've worried I could die, violent spasming, coming out of both ends until dry, hallucinating etc. So, I've wondered what exactly I'm getting that it takes that long to even feel sick, like are they really giving me methadone or something?

Anyway, I know a ton of people will say, go to rehab etc. But I really can't. I have 3 kids and 50% custody, and a full time good job. If I go to rehab I will lose that all, so save that answer for someone else.

I've been long term sober before and am literally just maintaining at this point, preventing myself from being sick for the aforementioned reasons, I feel like if the rapid detox can actually work, I 100% believe in myself that I will stay sober.

**EDIT**: I found a new article about the specific place I was thinking about going to and it points out some thing.

&#x200B;

I've finally become honest enough with myself to admit I need help. After years of abusing dihydrocodeine, the pandemic situation made my usage way, way worse these last few months. It's got to the point that I'm getting shakes, agitation and inability to sleep after 24 hours not using - used to be able to go about 2 or 3 days before I would have trouble. Now by 2 days I'm vomiting, shaking, feeling like I need to claw off my own skin. I can't handle this chemical dependency much longer. I need a plan to taper off.

I have a few weeks supply with which to taper, but I'm scared, and new to this, and don't know what else I can do to make the WDs at least tolerable. If I could just sleep through the worst of it, that would probably be enough. What kind of complementary therapies has worked for you guys, in terms of both prescription and over the counter meds?

I don't like him being in pain but I don't like the idea of accepting this kind of treatment to cover up pain that could be fixed. I know the final decision is his but I don't know how to feel about it. Advice or thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. Thank you.,2

I've been on subutex for 10 years. In all that time, I've never used an illegal drug, and never had a dirty urine test. I was addicted to codeine which you can get over the counter in the UK. (or, you used to be able to when I was living there). I have a full time job that I've had for 8 years. I'm totally stable. So my problem was never illegal drugs. (just telling you all this for context). My doctor only requires I see him once every three months. 

Well, I have this friend who has an attitude about my prescription. I should never have told him. Every health problem I have he tries to blame on buprenorphine. I've have female hair loss and I've seen many doctors. He asks, 'did you tell them about the prescription? Because maybe that is contributing.' 

Lately I've had a chronic ear infection. He asked if I told the ent doctor about the subutex because maybe it is contributing. To me, that's ludicrous. Am I off my rocker or is he? 

Finally, I've been on 4mg for 10 years. We were going to hang out one day And when we met he said, 'you seem high. Can you not use that stuff when we are going to hang out?' I replied that I am on the exact same dose I have been on every single time he has EVER seen me (we didn't meet until I had been on the subs for 5 years) , and anyway, I must take it every day as not to feel sick

Our relationship was amazing despite us being complete opposites of people we attract & have so much fun whenever we are together and i was sober but when i would relapse along came the chaos arguments of whether i loved the drugs more than her. lost of her trust in me. her being scared of me dying and feelings of her not ever being able to trust me lead to her breaking up with me. we loved eachother unconditionally and it’s been about 5 months w almost 2 months of no
contact because we struggled to let go and decided it would be best and we
both have some growing to do. i now will have 4 months clean and she said when we brokeup that maybe after 6 months we would be able to try things again. neither of us are talking to someone as i saw her in person the other day and talked for a little. i miss her a lot everyday and still think about her before i go to sleep and when i wakeup all day pretty much i wanted to marry her and still would like to create a new relationship with her. However understand her feelings because of her mom and dad being alcoholics and her dealing with that her whole life. she felt she shouldn’t have to deal w that from her future husband as well. anyone have any advice on what i should do? my thoughts were that i should play it cool and not seem desperate. casually talk to her and try to hangout and fall in love all over again..but that’s wishful thinking..i’m stuck here and whenever i hangout w other girls or talk to others i’m stuck thinking about her and how nobody seems to bring the feeling she does. idk what to do. it doesn’t hurt like it used too i just wish she was here to have funn and enjoy and grow with me in life while im sober and feeling blessed  and happy everyday. just
wish i had her by my side. it sucks i made my bed and now i have to lie in it.",8

I recently lost my source and my finances hit the end of the road - so I spoke to my girlfriend about things and I'm fast tapering with intentions to stabilise for a week or two at a fairly low dose, then quit. Currently, I am able to sustain myself for a full 12 hour work shift on 80mg oxycodone a day. Whilst I understand it's a lot, it's a damn side better than huge amounts of H. When I dropped this much, I did experience significant withdrawals, even threw up once- but I only threw up once, not for days. I was uncomfortable and sleep was a daily struggle, but it wasn't the true hell of CT. 

I know you can't really say without knowing the H purity and fent content, but do you think that this is as significant of a jump as it feels in my head?

Stayed with her for 1 week, 24/7, while she detoxed at home. I'm afraid of her relapsing. What can I do?","Found out that my (32M) girlfriend (34F) is addicted to snorting drugs. Stayed with her for 1 week, 24/7, while she detoxed at home. I'm afraid of her relapsing. What can I do? We're on like week 3 or 4 of her being clean and sober (I think, I'm not around her 24/7 now)

Specifically, she's been addicted to fentanyl for the past year and only within the last week before I found out, she had been doing carfentanyl. Her dealers would cut (saturate it) with sleep aid and tylenol extra strength. If she got it pure, she'd do it herself. That's why she was nodding off constantly all the time.

After I found out, I stayed with her at her place for 1 week, 24/7, as she detoxed and went through withdrawls. I took my work laptop with me and hopped on her wifi, then just worked there as I kept an eye on her. Cold chills, cold sweats, shaking, goosebumps, vomiting, shitting herself, not wanting to eat, you name it. It broke me to see her like that. I love her so so much. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.

During that week, I made sure to take care of the kids, ordered door dash for me and the oldest kid, fed the youngest, gave her the meds she needs, cleaned her house a bit, took out the trash, etc etc. But I stayed by her side for the most part when I wasn't doing that. I'd hold her when she needed to be held, and give her encouragement when she needed it. I was there for every shitty second of it.

When we began the detox, I bought her like 5 jugs of pedialyte to keep her hydrated, women's multivitamins to keep something in her body, extra strength pepto bismol, Imodium, charcoal pills, vitamin B12, potassium pills, niacin, sprite, icy hot patches, etc. I think it came out to like $200 total. Just shit that I read would help her through it.

Also, she has 2 kids. One kid is special needs,  Septo-Optic dysplasia SOD/ONH, and the other is old enough that she just kinda does her own thing in her room, playing games on her computer. The oldest is old enough to recognize what's going on now, and it's heart breaking. I've grown very close to both kids. I've learned how to feed the special needs kid, and how to give her meds to her. I've been trying very hard with the kids, and I think they're starting to love me.

So, now, we're at a cross roads. I \*think\* she's clean and sober right now after that detox week. I've spent some time with her and she seems alert and doing well. I'm not seeing any symptoms or signs of her relapsing, so that's good. She's getting a lot done around her house, a lot of DIY projects, versus when she was on that shit, she would just sleep all the time, and not get anything done. She'd have 1 productive day out of an entire week. That drug isn't doing what she thought it was.

It's not causing her to be productive. It's causing everything around her to collapse and be ruined. It's causing her to lose everything. She almost lost me when I found out, because I had clearly said when we started seeing each other - I have 3 relationship rules: No hard drugs, no lying, no cheating. She broke 2 of those by doing hard drugs and lying to me about it.

I told her, if you relapse, just let me know. We'll deal with it. Isn't like I'm going to just up and leave you. We'll deal with it together. We're a team and we CAN beat this together. I want to get her into 1 on 1 counseling soon, I haven't spoken to her about that yet, to keep her on the straight and narrow.

Now, the other part of this, is that she's always been a very independent person who loves her ""me time"" to process things and think things through, as well as time to spend with the kids and work on her crafts. So, now that the withdrawl symptoms have pretty much stopped - she said she still gets random cold chills from time to time - she's going out and working (construction - drywalling, and drywall mudding) then coming back home late at night and just crashing, she's been putting in 10-12+ hour days doing that, keeping herself busy, and when she goes home she just crashes.

I hope that's been working to keep her distracted and busy. I haven't heard a lot from her since she started working that job, but she sends me pics from time to time, like one where she's covered in drywall mud with a ""wtf"" look on her face lol. I think if she sent me more pics like that regularly, I'd feel more comfortable. Doesn't haves to sit around and talk for hours or anything, just send me pics of what you're up to every now and then throughout the day, so I know you're safe and not relapsing. Is that too much to ask for?

She says she's only taking vicodins right now and that's it, which seems ok to me. It's not fucking fentanyl or carfentanyl so I think I'll take that, at least. That seems like a win. Going from the hardest fucking thing out there, that could kill her in an instant, to something much less potent. I'll take it. It still isn't ideal, but it's something.

Like I said, I told her if she relapses, I'm here for her. We'll find a way to get through it together. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to do this 100 times. I don't have it in me to go through that anywhere near that many times. She said that NO ONE has ever done that for her before, being there for her as she detoxed and went through it. I said look, I love you. If this is what I gotta do to get sober you, then I'm here for it. As much as it destroyed me, I'm here.

When I'm home at my place, that's all I can think about. ""What if she has her friend bring her some and she relapses? What if she goes out and gets some herself?"" Hell, every time she goes to the bathroom, I think ""what if she has a stash hidden in there (wouldnt surprise me, but I couldnt find it last time I was there) and that's the last time i see her alive, is walking into the bathroom? what if she snorts some shit she has stashed away, she ODs, and dies?"" that fucking terrifies me so bad, because I love her so much. What also terrifies me, is if she ODs and one of the kids finds her. God, that'd be fucked.

I've even went as far as to contact the dealers I know she buys from, and say to them: If she ever contacts you for shit, screenshot it, send it to me, and I'll pay you DOUBLE to NOT give it to her. Keep your shit, I don't want it. I just want to keep her sober. They've all responded positively to that, of course. Money talks with those people.

Monday, I sent her flowers and chocolates. Today, I popped up at her place, and gave her and her oldest daughter [flowers](https://imgur.com/a/Hvy7J7F) \- my way of saying that I want ALL OF THIS, a family, together, with you. A package deal. I also gave her a [hand written letter](https://imgur.com/a/JJVvFih) that I put in with a card.  And a box of a dozen random doughnuts from Tim Hortons. I'm trying to show her so much love and support, that it's impossible for her to question her worth, impossible for her to question how much I love her, and impossible for her to think ""no one cares about me"" - all she has to do is look around her place. Flowers, candy, food, pillows, clothes, etc etc every room of her place has at least 1 thing I've bought for her in it. So, she should be constantly reminded of my presence, and how much she's loved and cared for.

So anyways, like the original question says. What can I do?  I want to ensure that she stays clean and stays on this path, but I also don't want to be overbearing and showing up at her place randomly all the time, I know she values her ""me time"" a lot, even sober, so I know that would just make her irritated with me. I just want the best for her. I love her so damn much. 

Update: found out that she relapsed on the 31st, has been using again, and has been lying about it the whole time. She told me and fessed up to it. I left her. I just can't keep doing this again and again. So, I left her. It was hard. Most difficult thing I've ever done. If she just hadn't lied to me about it from the start, then I would've stayed. If she would've just been honest to me about it. 

Deleted my Facebook, deleted my snapchat. Sure, she can call me and come over. But I doubt she'll do that. Going to sell my house here in Ohio and move to KY. I'm done. I give up. She broke me. I'll always love her. I don't think I'll love anyone like I loved her. I'm not even going to try to date again. Nothing will compare. But she loves the drugs more than she loves me and the kids. 😭",19

I am 3 years clean from dope and other opiates. Taking Suboxone has allowed me to rebuild and clean my life up and im very thankful. Unfortunately i discovered i could buy and snort subutex and get high. Well, im ready to get off my suboxone prescription but i cannot stop craving the subutex. The truth behind that statement is that i cannot stop craving getting high. I think i am even addicted to snorting things, getting high fast and relaxing hard. I have a strenuous life. I won't get into it here but i have a great life, i work hard and i crave relaxing hard. I don't really enjoy weed except when i can't sleep. I've also never been a drinker, I say all of this because i think i will need to trade one vice for another at least temporarily. I think it will be much easier to retrain my brain out of addiction with something softer. 

I like Kratom but i can't take the powder, its too harsh on my stomach. I think Kratom will honestly be that mildly softer substance i switch to in order to start retraining my brain. I have all sorts of things ready to help me detox - a plan to wean slowly from now until December, N-acetyl-tyrosine, 5-HTP, Vit C, Dlpa, U-Finer (Chinese detox formula for withdrawal), herbs to support cognitive function and neural pathways, etc. The problem is the subutex. On one hand, I feel like weaning off of suboxone entirely and then the subutex makes sense, but i realize that snorting the subutex should ideally be the first to go. Im also just totally terrified of detoxing because i know the detox from subs is longer and almost just as bad as dope. I have a lot to lose. 

For reference im only taking 4mg of suboxone a day but i snort 8-10mg of subutex a day. 

I am really not looking to be shamed. I feel awful about it and guilty enough as it is. This is my first post here and i guess im really looking for someone with experience snorting tex, support, encouragement and input.

Sleep is the hardest part.","So, back story, you can skip this part if youd like. My DOC has always been oxycodone and hydrocodone. I was heavily addicted to them from 2012-2017. Took upwards of 100 mg a day, everyday. In January of 2017, I had a big medical scare and had the perfect opportunity to detox with medication and have access to therapists and doctors. Anyways, I was sober for 3 years, until i relapsed earlier this year after losing my job. Funny how ""just gonna take some again to remember how it feels"" turns back into a daily addiction. Next thing I know, 5 months have passed and here I am. But I am 6 days clean now and not looking back.

So that leads me to my relation point, God damn is it impossible to sleep. In the past 5 nights, I've slept a combined total of about 12 hours. Last night I was able to get 4 hours, woohoo! It's insane. The constant body aches and restless legs leave me tossing and turning all night, completely unable to get comfortable. Falling asleep just to wake up, minutes later, in a sweat soaked bed, full of confusion and depression. Strange, distressing feelings of impending doom. It's been horrible. But, it was slightly easier last night than the previous 4, so I know it will continue to improve over time. thanks all for reading and good fight!",10

I’ve probably tried four times in the last two months.  I’m only 12 hours in so far but this weekend feels different.  Every other time I’ve been full of dread and anxiety.  But this time I’m not.  I actually feel ready in a way I never have before.  This is the longest I’ve gone in a year.  I know I have a long way to go still.   But goddamn I am so done letting this continue to control my life and fuck up my finances.  I’ve never tried posting here for support before so I thought I’d try this weekend.  I’ve got to stop this before I lose everything.  Any tips or words of encouragement would be appreciated.  I imagine in the next 24 hours I’ll be pouring sweat and writhing around in bed.  But this shit has got to stop.  I hate it.  I want my fucking life back.,3

Ascorbic acid is the type of Vitamin C found in every drugstore’s vitamins — so please don’t just grab any bottle off the shelves thinking it’s the right stuff (check the label, nearly all forms of Vit C are AA, not SA).

2020-09-05 10:11:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/in1qsg/what_i_want_others_to_know_about_addiction_after/,What I want others to know about addiction after losing my brother,"My brother Adam died at the age of 23 years old in 2018. He lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict.

Adam had the best laugh. It was loud & boisterous. He was tall, handsome, daring and charming. Eight years my junior, I grew up watching him come into his own. I remember him putting on magic shows in the living room. One time, he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared. Adam wanted reassurance that he wasn’t too old for that. As any big sister would, I told him of course it was okay.

As time went on, I grew to be the worrier of the family. Adam grew up to be a total daredevil. Jumping off the Stratosphere in Vegas, flying a hot air balloon with my Dad, and living his life in the fast lane.

My brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk. I used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened, he always came out of the situation unscathed.

He became a drug addict slowly, but with warning signs. In the end, it seemed like he was overdosing every other day. The calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless. The year before he died, my parents got a call from California encouraging us all to fly out there. He overdosed and his numbers were horrible. In this dark time, we all prepared to say goodbye to him. Miraculously, he landed on his feet yet again.

This time the overdose had consequences. He passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage. He couldn’t use his hands for a while, but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well. The doctors said his hands wouldn’t recover and that the damage was permanent.  After about six months, he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise, were told he’d make a full recovery. I remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands. I sat there in awe, crying happy tears.

Surely, this will all make him wake up and stop using, I thought. I hoped. In times like this, hope is the only thing that really gets you through. Every time something catastrophic happened, this was my mindset.

We never quite got the whole story, but I knew things weren’t looking good. He seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and I felt angry that there wasn’t a damn thing I could do to stop it.

In the year or so before he passed away, my friend Kate who had lost her Dad to alcoholism, told me to prepare myself for the worst. She said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened. Maybe, just maybe, if I could do that, it would help me in the long run. I reluctantly took her advice. I sat down in my office and really thought about what she said. I cried for what felt like forever.

This harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words. Every time I saw my brother, I acted as if it could be the last time. This has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things. I don’t have regrets of what I could have done, because I know for sure I tried everything. Tough love, soft love and everything in between.
Of course, none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated. Who am I to impart any wisdom on others?

There is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience. I never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses. I saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was. I remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because I was worried he’d overdose and die. I was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there. It was his choice to leave. I’d be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers.

I spent hours talking to him about his addiction, trying to understand it and help him in any way I could. I suggested everything I could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me. I’d take his calls even when I suspected he was high. Sometimes he’d make no sense and ask for money. Other times, the Adam I knew and loved was just calling to say hi. I never missed one of those calls.

Most importantly, I spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before I left. I told him how much I loved him and cherished every second. If I had not done this, I know for sure I’d look back with regret.

Something I wasn’t prepared for was how permanent death is.

He flew home from rehab in California and I saw him the day before he died. He was back in town to get surgery on his other hand. I remember him standing in the driveway on my way out. I told him again for the millionth time not to use, especially before or after his surgery. He agreed not to and I told him I loved him. We hugged and I got into my car. That was the last time I saw my brother.

I wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it. To those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them, please know that you are not alone. I grew up in the middle class. We had a nice house on a cul-de-sac. We were taught to love each other. No one would have expected what was going on in our lives.

I want to share a few words of wisdom I have learned along the way. Take it as you will.
To those of you in the beginning stages of grief… hold on. I know you feel like you’re drowning and can’t catch your breath. You will breathe again, I promise. In the beginning, my family took everything ten seconds at a time. I cried for months in grocery store lines. There were long periods of time where I woke up crying and I went to bed crying. I could hardly catch my breath.

Please, hang on. We had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives. I encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it.

Cry your eyes out. I used to hate crying until I realized how healing it is. Let’s be honest, I still hate it, but I can recognize its undeniable benefits. To process grief, you have to feel the emotions behind it. I promise, you won’t cry forever. Crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring. Cry yourself to sleep, bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is you’re feeling in the moment.

To anyone suffering with addiction, please know you are loved and you are not alone. I want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. It’s been a year and a half, and I still cry every single day. Please, do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can.

Addiction is something a person is suffering with. It does not define who they are. It’s easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path. Offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment. That addict is someone’s family member or best friend. All I’m saying is, love goes a lot farther than judgment. As humans, we are all suffering in some way. It makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement, love, and understanding to a person.

To families and friends of addicts, I see you. I know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole. It’s a hopeless, devastating feeling I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I try to openly share my story with others. You would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing. We feel like we need to hide in the shadows because it’s embarrassing to discuss. Trust me, I get it. Please remember, none of us choose this. It’s something that unfortunately happens way more than it should.

To those reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to what I have to say. I miss my brother every single second of every single day. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear his laugh. On the really tough days, that gets me through.

And to my brother Adam; fly high. I will never forget you.

For years after high school. It was never an issue it was always a weekend or party thing. Never copped on my own. Long story short one day I end up getting my own stuff, and that’s when the daily use begins. I use for about a month then I’m like “wtf this isn’t you, you gotta stop” and that’s when I felt the withdrawals... scariest thing I’ve gone through.... fast forward I got about 14 days in when I ran into an old buddy who offered me a 30. I wanted to see if I could go back to using it “once in awhile” dumb idea. I used alittle one day, alittle more the next day, then I’ve gone to using for 3 consecutive days... That’s when I realized how screwed I am.... (should’ve learned the first time I know) fast forward today I got 16 days down and I just caved. I saw a friend on Snapchat saying he had perc 10’s for sale. I told myself the same stupid theory “just see if you can use one time and then you can go back to doing it for fun here and there” I just need advice right now. I just bought one, I barley feel high, I’m just more sad that I caved again. Will Kratom help my craving when I hit that 15 day mark? Or will it make things worse? It’s mostly the mental side I struggle with. For some weird reason I can go a week or so feeling positive and I got it in the bag, then all the sudden this wave of depression and emptiness makes me start becoming irrational. I have no connections anymore, they’re all deleted, I’m serious about my recovery. I’m ready to get months/years under my belt. I’m just deciding now I need to ask for a little more help. I go to therapy every week and I have a drug test every other week to keep me accountable so I have the tools to do it right, it’s just a matter of doing it.

Just had about 130 days clean from oxy. Relapsed first about a month. I’ve kinda gone done to doing 1.5-2 30s a day last few days.

I’ve detoxed at home with clonidine gaba benzos and a little Kratom it’s worked but still sucks.

Anyways I need to get back off and I’ve come across 2 5mg methadone tablets. I’ve never done mdone and know the horror stories.

If I stop the oxy today and wait for my WD to kick in usually starts the night after I stop or the day after that. If I use 1-2 5mg mDone pills will that’s dope to my withdrAwl or prolong it in anyway. Or would such a low dose and only 1-2 days of it potentially help as an end to the “taper” of oxy ?

I notice that I go in waves, I have a few really good months and then dabble in it for a few weeks before going clean again. Ideally, I would like just stop completely. Now that school is starting up again, a lot of my time is used up with that and this is when I would really like to stop using - because I notice that when I use during school, I'm extremely tired, stressed out, don't get enough sleep, struggling to focus, lazy, etc.

When I'm not using and I'm going to school, my mind is fresh and clean everything is so much better - also because my time is occupied, I'm being constructive and don't have the urge to use because all of my time is dedicated to studying, learning or doing other positive stuff, I get a good night sleep, wake up early, well rested, etc.

When I use, I stay up late, wake up super late, groggy, get irritated easily, eat like shit, smoke weed, disregard my social life, etc. etc.

I'd love to begin some good habits and make a routine of it. Since school just started, a lot of my time is now occupied with that. I'm about to start learning Japanese also and am very happy about that (going to be hard, but it will be good for me), and I would love to start reading more and begin a workout program I've been meaning to start  since a few weeks ago.

I'd love to start some habits, even something like gratitude or meditating, some easily.  What suggestions do you guys have? What positive habits did you guys incorporate in your life when you stopped using/helped you stop using? What habits really stuck and change your perspective, attitude, feelings, drive, etc. for the better? For me, usually the hardest thing is finding the motivation and staying with it. Some days I just feel down and don't feel like doing anything  that I ""want"" to do.

# Need help with rapid taper strategies

📷

After being on suboxone for a little over 4 months, Ive still managed to relapse with fentanyl several times and jump back on the suboxone. Due to this, I feel that I should probably take myself off suboxone completely. I was planning on performing a rapid taper. Does anyone know any effective strategies for this? I am on 16 mg currently and would like to be down to 2 in 2 weeks time.

Any tips would be appreciated.",1

2020-09-02 23:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ilm548/best_advice_for_a_loved_one/,Best advice for a loved one??,"Hey ya’ll - partner of a heroin addict here. It has been a long and bumpy road for the past 5 years with everything coming to a head last July when I gave birth to our son. Since then he has had 3 stints in inpatient (the 3rd of which is currently still in progress). This time seems different. I know that sounds cliche, but it does. 

Prior to him entering rehab this last time, it got particularly bad - the worst it has been to date. It got to a point where I was tearing the apartment apart looking for his stash, hoarding it and then rationing him tiny bumps of what I assume was fentanyl based on his behavior when on it. I never imagined I’d be in this position, willingly giving the father of my child drugs. Im sure he never imagined he’d be in that position either, but hey, I guess that’s just the nature of the beast. I hate myself for doing what I did, but at the time it seemed like a better alternative than him leaving to score more, potentially driving under the influence and/or picking up something that was cut with some fatal bullshit. I did what I did, and I’m not proud, but like I said - the name of the game in that moment was reducing the risk as much as possible until intake at his rehab facility a few days later. 

Anyway....like I was saying, it got pretty bad at the end, but now he’s in rehab putting the pieces back together again - feeling all the shame and guilt and whatnot.

My question to all of you is - what kind of advice do those of you in recovery have for loved ones of addicts? I know there’s family groups and whatnot - I plan to lurk in some online families anonymous meetings to get a little more comfortable with the idea before I go in person, but then in general do you have any words of wisdom for me?

Its been a struggle on a lot of fronts and ultimately I just want to support him in any way I can. His parents, who are trying to be supportive in their own (incorrect imo) way are just kind of making things worse. They told him on the phone that they plan to physically take him and go into NA meetings with him for 60 days straight when he gets out. When I suggested that maybe they compromise and go to the family NA combo meetings in our area that are separate but in the same location/same time, they basically told me that they know better and think that embarrassing him  by forcing him to participate in meetings in front of them will be helpful somehow. I very much believe it will have the opposite effect and I have had a knot in my stomach ever since they voiced this to me earlier tonight. They aren’t bad people, they just think they have all the answers.

I don’t pretend to have any answers or any semblance of understanding of what its like to be addicted to opiates, but I do know that I love my partner and that he’s an incredible father and best friend when he is sober. Are there any suggestions ya’ll can give to me to help support him best? Or any suggestions on how to handle his well meaning, but bizarre parents? Lol

Still feel like shit, but hey....at least I’m not using, I guess. I was gonna pick up today, but oddly enough my plug isn’t answering his phone, which is strange because he has been nothing but straight up. Either means his phone took a dive, he went dry, or got arrested. The alignment of all these events is odd in and of itself. Generally, I wouldn’t be on subs, I wouldn’t have a business trip, and my plug would answer his phone. Do I want to quit? Yea, I suppose so, do I want it bad enough to feel like I do? I suppose not.... but if I don’t have a connect I’m sure AF not seeking one, although I’m sure I could find someone, which is what sucks I’m good at that. But might as well quit. Commit for the 2 1/2 weeks the trip is gonna take, I just have to be sure to taper subs. Anxiety has been so high lately my work productivity is non existent, luckily I’m working from home. I feel super depressed the past 4 days, but I guess it’s all part of it. So I’m on 4mg if subs rn, should I switch to kratom at this point or stay on subs and taper? I think I could get by on kratom, I’m just not sure about getting off of it or subs for that matter, do I try antidepressants? Do I even need them? My ADHD is sooo bad right now, I used to take meds for it, but kind of unwittingly was using opioids for that as well as and found them more effective than any stims, I also have anxiety, depression, insomnia tendencies. Eh.... forced sobriety is a blessing, but I’m not happy with it, I always want to be sober and once I start taking the steps I get confused and lose my center, if that makes sense. I still can’t bring myself to talk to an addiction specialist.... or anyone for that matter.

The last 30 hours have been the worst of my life. My partner, my love of my life, caught me using. I completely broke and fucked up his trust in me - I'm afraid he will leave me. He dealt with me in PWDs throughout the night, going to the ER, my shittiest worst side. He had never seen me in my wds, let alone PWDs, let alone an at home detox..

&#x200B;

He said it was like there was a stranger in his bed. He couldn't look at me. He said a lot of things.. they really hurt but I understand. I just can't bear to lose him. It gives me a lot of anxiety.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway... Today I am no longer doing things my way. Clearly that shit does not fucking work. Hasn't worked for 10 years. 

I am going to a private treatment facility on Friday. In all my years of debauchery I've never actually gone to a long term treatment facility - only shitty province sponsored detoxes. 

Everyone in my life knows - my boss, my partner, my parents, my friends and my roommate. 

&#x200B;

I ended up copping today around 1pm to help dull the PWDs. Didn't really help but it did subside some major aspects. I feel nothing like I did at 1am-12pm today. I've been reading some addiction books and I still feel like hot garbage, but not even as close as how I felt earlier.

Im pretty syre its cut with fent.. because the stuff i get i remember is really strong.  In the start a 10 bag would last me 2 days... 

Now i go through $40 by 6pm.. and then i usually need another $40 to make it the rest of the day or until 2am when i fall asleep...

I tried to withdraw a couple weeks ago.. i went to a local county detox.  It was sooooo cold.. and i wasnt allowes to use weed. I lasted 2 days and was flopping around like a dying fish on dry water until i checked myself out..

Since then I have been too scared to try because im worried my habit is so bad that the withdrawal is gonna be unbearable.  I ended up atarting methadone because it was my only option.. but after realizing how strong it is and how its basically impossible to taper down because naturally we go in the opposite direction and Build tolerance and need more.. so how is anyone supposed to use less and expect to be okay. 

I ended up call8ng my dad and asking for help.  He said i can come to florida and wothdraw on his couch.  My flight is on thursday.. and ill be there for about 2 weeks.  

Im really scared and dont know how bad it is going to be.  I know i have to take my marijuana supply with me and i do have detox meds like clonidonr! Loperamide and something for the rls.

I know where to get some however (wink wink), but I was hoping to get some advice from those that use it, especially the yanks who can get it in shops throughout the states and seem much more familiar with it's use. What form do you take it in (tea, capsules)? How much do you take? Does is cause WD symptoms separate from H if used too much? Or does it just prolong the H WD like  methadone or subs? It's not just a H substitute is it? Can I use it for 3,4,5 days in a row without suffering when coming off it? I'd rather just suffer more for a shorter time than prolong this.

I can get it for quite cheap, and it seems to come in a powdery like form (from what I can see) in a baggie, or capsules. I can also get kava root, which also comes in powder or capsule form (is that different?). Any help would be great! You guys are really helpful, very positive community overall so thanks.
