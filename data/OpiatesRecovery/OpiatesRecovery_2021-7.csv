I feel overall a bit better today but I'm still worried it's all just gonna come back again or her worse idk. I was able to eat more today and even picked up around the house no problem. I still get random sad periods , and I'm super emotional , watching shows random things trigger it and music especially when I felt like listening to it today, alot of songs made me feel very strong emotions. I also got some "" VOACATOX "" as recommend by another user and I think it's helped alot with everything! Also for the first time in a good bit I could feel the effects of weed again after taking a ton of dabs. I don't think I realized while I was getting addicted over that month that the effects of weed just were no longer present to me, it was just putting blues up my nose all my brain wanted, granted I still smoked while using but purely out of habit I don't think it was doing jack. 


Also I'm a bit worried to drive again, I won't have too till Monday as I've been driven everywhere so far. Just feels like I'ma be stupid driving as my brain is a squirrely and don't wanna endanger myself. Anyone have thoughts on this?

What I thought was an impossibility a few years ago has turned into a reality. As I sit here reflecting on all I've been through all I've lost due to my issues with addiction I am overwhelmed with joy. Why joy you ask? Because all that I have gained in these short 9 months of sobriety vastly outweighs the past. As I sit here I am feeling something I haven't felt in a long time...pride. Pride because all the garbage and bullshit I fought through has made me the man I am today. A strong, hardworking, giving, loyal tough sonofabitch that now feels he can do anything he puts his mind to. But most of all humble. There is no way I could've done this alone. So many people have helped me get to where I am today.. People around me believed in me enough not to give up on me and it wasn't until I was finally ready to come to terms with the fact that I couldn't do this alone that I have succeed....so far. Tomorrow is not guaranteed. So just for today...I have succeeded. Thank you all so much.

So I can‚Äôt really say if my experience will relate to yours if H was your doc.

So I abused opiate prescription meds since I was about 14/15. It gradually went from oxy‚Äôs to hydros/D‚Äôs. I would use about 2 or 3 30mg hydromorph contin, or like 8 real dilidud 8s. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt keep up with my addiction and maintain a somewhat normal life, I tried to kick it and I remember going home from work I was so sick (I was a roofer at the time‚Ä¶ go figure right?). The next day I signed my soul off to the devil.. errr methadone maintenance. 

See the thing with methadone is IMO the W/D‚Äôs aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúworse‚Äùthen the pills I was using, but it‚Äôs a lot longer. Rather then being over acute W/D‚Äôs in 5/6 days. It‚Äôs over a week, sometimes 2 depending the dosage/taper/ and how long it‚Äôs been taken for.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you can function on this stuff, cravings are next to none, and it‚Äôs accessible for nothing or next to it (compared to a regular addicts heroin or dilly bill) I think with no coverage it‚Äôs 10$ a day.

With all that being said I wouldn‚Äôt wish the methadone program on my worst enemy. The doctors would rather you be a lifer then get off it. And you can only get 6 drinks to take home. So you‚Äôre stuck, I call it liquid handcuffs.

So I‚Äôm on day 4 about to be 5. What‚Äôs gotten me through day 3 and 4 so far is clonidine and lots of weed. Clonidine literally cut my w/d symptoms in half, maybe even more. I got 8hrs of sleep last night and got a nap in today. It works, no cold chills, muscle aches, sweats, and my rls was cut by 75%.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49148738}"

I'm not saying kratom will get everyone of you clean but it worked for me and it's worth a shot for you all to try, I'm 4 weeks clean now from opiates. Also keep in mind kratom is a opiate it self so you can withdrawal from it but the withdrawals are extremely mild and tolerable compared to other opiate withdrawal such as herion and oxycodone.

I have been an avid member of the opiate and recovery subreddits for the past 9 years. It‚Äôs only in the past three that I‚Äôve attempted to recover and this past year is the longest I‚Äôve ever been successful at it for. 

If you know me, you know I was a victim. It was always woe is me. Today that is not the case. I am a survivor and grateful.  

Gratitude has been the cornerstone of my recovery.

I would post in a more appropriate subreddit but it hasn't seen new text in months.

Over the years the seed I've been getting has gotten weaker and I've tapered by half twice over those years. (6 years) Twice a day since my father died. The last taper being only 2 weeks ago. I've been using weed to try mitigate some of the effects or maybe because I just need drugs. I'm an addict, I don't really know the truth. That's another story though.

I am way overdue for this.  Its been almost 6.5 years with maybe an aggregate total of 2 months clean.   I expect pain during detox.  The greatest source of guilt is that I have a beautiful 7 y/o daughter.  When she was 4, her mother and I went to court and the final orders were in my favor compared to most fathers. For example I was granted 2 days every week, every spring  break and a month straight in summer.  As time went on,  her mom gave me more and more time and I ended up having my daughter more than her mother and this enabled me to collect for her on my tax return and even get my child support with her mothers notarized signature. Essentially zeroed out. Anyway,  I was busted with less than a G of tar (state jail felony) bonded out and 3-4 months later same thing occurred.  Bonded out again.  I accepted the fact that doing my time should be avoided since I am a parent that is prominently in my daughter's life.  Anyway, her mother pulled a 180, yanked my daughter from me for my standard visit on my birthday (6/27)  and then again on my month that had my daughter's birthday (july) and hired an attorney and after refusing my monthly I was served with all kinds of just plain bullshit: PFA, that included staying away from my daughter at school and everywhere.  Reduced visits to 2-30 minute video chats and a 6 hour in person so long as I can pass a urine screening at a lab the day before.  Those cost $50 each, summarily doubling my support expenses.  I had to get an attorney and there went $5k that would have been much better spent on a defense attorney per those 2 possession charges.  At any rate: her mom saw the opportunity to strike and her present BF is in a better spot than myself financially and they have a son 3 years younger than our daughter and he abandoned them for 5 months and paid nothing during that time.  I even had the little guy over, to give their mom a break on more than a few occassions. He ended up calling me dad, I would correct him every time trying to teach him to call me ""nen"" as my nieces do.  He saw his son do this and while a shot to his pride he also saw me correct him every single time. Flash forward to 5 minutes ago:  skyping with my daughter her phone alarm sounds off at 30 minute mark and she says ""i have to go. Bye.""  Her mom has clearly brainwashed her.  I hurt so hard in ways I didn't know i could. I hate her mother so strongly that I am almost handicapped by it.  So much fiction from her end. I don't know what to do. I realize on paper i am an easy target for a custody battle.  But this is just so wrong.  The only thing important to me so easily manipulated,  changed and taken because she has a bit better financial access. Step 1 obviously sober up.  Step 2 job again 3. Catch up the support that any other year would havd been signed off on...what about this hate? This anger? This absolute betrayal?  I already gave so much of myself to make sure she and her brother bad an appropriately fostered relationship. Is a dad thats been there most of a childs life so easily forgotten or replaced? How do i focus on recovery when i know that presently she is not just winning, but effectively reducing my daughter's perception of my value as her father in her life? Sorry this is so long and dramatic if you have read this much I am sorry for my Jerry Springer caliber drama. I feel so fucked right now.

Edit: thank you all for the kindness and support you're sharing.   I am trying to change my perception that treatment will make me the best dad I could possibly be.  That really is what matters.  I'm really not an idiot, contrary to what pleading my end would automatically seem.  My daughter shouldn't be in the position where her custodial parent gets decided by determining which is the least shit parent.  Its my goal to eliminate the possibility of being perceived as a bad, or not-too-bad or awful or could-be-better. She deserves me at my best. I iust suck at keeping that focus. Am human.

a little backstory, i was using heroin for about 3 years and the last year was IV use alongside intense benzo use. i‚Äôve been put into an IOP program where i‚Äôm around a lot of people my age all day and i struggle so much just talking to them. i can only respond in one word answers it feels like my brain is just fried whenever someone speaks to me. it‚Äôs awful because i‚Äôm going to be around these people everyday for the foreseen future and i just cannot make friends. it‚Äôs like i completely forgot how to socialize. it took me about 3 weeks to finally start talking when i was in rehab but that seemed much easier because it was a much smaller group.

today the cravings have just been off the charts. i got home and just laid in bed thinking about dope. i know i should get up and do something to take my mind off it but fuck man i‚Äôm just so depressed lately.

Here's what worked for me! Don't wait until it's to late; Take your freedom, serenity, self respect and dignity back!","Hoping this post is able to reach the people that are feeling hopeless, who are in pain, dealing with depression, ptsd, those who are self medicating to numb their pain so they don't have to deal with emotions. I know how that feels all to well, bc that was me prior to making the decision to take my life back!

Today I have 15 days of recovery, my last oxy that I took was 16 days ago. I made the decision to jump and go cold turkey instead of tapering; I could never taper successfully. The truth is if I had them, I was gonna take them and worry about tomorrow when tomorrow comes. (Fucked up way of thinking, yea I know.) Guess that's just the repetitive cycle that an addict goes through on a daily basis. I know I felt like a hamster on a wheel running in circles chasing my ass for a long time, but not anymore.

Here's a list of what helped me during the first 2 weeks;

Liposomal Vitamin C (Dr Mercola) search mega dosing (super helpful) The amount you take is dependent on how you feel, but also how much opiates you were taking prior to your detox.

Voacatox (Opioid Detox dietary supplement 100% herbs)- I swear this shit works! I only ordered 1 bottle but honestly wish I would've ordered 2 with their bogoho discount. 

Gabapentin- use this for your RLS, I was already prescribed this at 600mg 3x day.

Immodium- helps with the uneasy feeling in your stomach and also prevents diarrhea. 

Zofran, Phenergan, or dramamine- all are used for nausea (I didn't have much nausea this time around during my detox, but in the past I was vomiting, so every detox is different.

Valerian Root tinctures, extra sleepy time tea, melatonin, seroquel, trazadone, doxipine- can all be used to help with sleep. 

Muscle relaxers- can also be helpful to calm your muscles down during the detox.

Clonidine- is a blood pressure medicine but it also helps with anxiety, RLS and many other withdrawal symptoms. I wasn't prescribed this until day 8, only bc my BP was super high. I only take it at night bc it makes me very drowsy.

Hot baths with Epsom salt, peppermint and lavender essential oils will also help with the RLS and body aches. After I did this for the first time, my body and legs felt soooo much better. 

Hopefully this list will help someone. Know that you can let go of your old lifestyle/habit and enjoy life. The drugs/alcohol are only masking the real issues, I swear it doesn't make things better, it only helps you to not think about it.

Well 32 days ago I said fuck this and decided it's time for me to try and live my life without this crap in it.  The first week was hard as hell. I quit cold turkey. I tried Kratom for the first 2 days and it made my anxiety worse not to mention I truly wanted off everything this time so I threw that shit away to.  I went to rehab like 5 years ago and did the whole Suboxone thing and the taper and told myself then that if I ever had to do this again that I was doing it CT cause the WD from the subs was worse for me then the WD from just the H and fent.  Yesterday I went to my very first NA meeting and I'm so glad I did.  I was nervous at first to go but man did it feel good to hear other people talk about the shit they felt and what their recovery has been like.  I only have one person in my life that knows I'm even going thru this and it's my Mom. I'm so thankful I have her and I can be honest with her. I was one of those addicts that could still function while high and I also knew how to hide it from everyone.  I can't tell you how many times I have heard people that I know talking shit about people with drug problems and how we choose this life and how if we wanted to get help we would blah blah. They had no clue that I was that person they were speaking of.  

Anyway, I just want to say thank you for everyone here for the updates, the encouragement, the fucking honesty, the help.

So long story short I got on methadone but continued to use for about a year. March 25th I went to jail for 12 days and cold turkey in a jail cell (Covid restrictions 14 day initial lock in). On day 13 I left to a court ordered rehab and came home after 28 days wasnt long before I was back thinking i knew about withdrawal and would stop before it would happen. I never knew what came with this stuff when I first started. Medical detox I cant sit there and wait to be sick I dont know why I dont wanna be on suboxone or anything but at this point I absconded from probation now have a warrant but the court peer advisor tells me if I go to detox or come in clean then maybe I can avoid the whole jail thing. I'll do my 4 months in jail but I fear like nothing I ever feared before the withdrawal in a jail cell. If I could just do it at home and have my TV and Dog and Fridge and even just a phone in my hand to take my mind off it. I dont know what to do I feel like jail is the only thing that can stop me but maybe if I taper down to .2 a day the withdrawal will be bearable. And I dont know If I want to be clean yet I still enjoy getting high even though its ripping my life apart. I'm 20 and it's just so much between my family legals and myself seeing myself deteriorate but I want to go cold turkey so any advice for that is what I'm looking for but I'm open to any solutions.

I have tried to join in on as many conversations as possible to help as many people as possible. Because that's why we're here to help each other. I have information that I would love to share with anyone who is interested. See I used to be a nurse before opiates took away my job, my livelihood, my family, my friends, my home, my kids, everything. Once I found Suboxone my whole life changed. I started to live again. Got my life back, my family back, and for the first time in years I was happy. I've been on Suboxone for 6 years now and couldn't be happier. I'm a responsible Suboxone user I take the lowest dose possible to live a normal life like I did before opiates took everything from me. I was in nursing school when oxy first came out and we were taught that pain is the 5th vital sign and any hospital who didn't assess pain and aggressively treat it could lose its accreditation. The pharmaceutical companies actually determined what we were taught in nursing school imagine that craziness. I've followed the science ever since wanting to know how this could happen and why. I want to share the latest science I have because I feel it's so important for as many people as possible to hear.

2021-07-27 16:25:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/osuhle/day_4_off_of_methadone/,Day 4 off of methadone,"So I got on methadone over a decade ago, and for 5 years it was bliss. Started a family, became nice responsible guy, complied with all clinic guidelines, etc. Unfortunately about 3 years ago I developed several chronic health conditions the methadone may be worsening.Several were GI disorders that have made me lose lots of weight. Anyway, some docs suggested coming off the methadone to see if it would help the conditions.  If this doesn't help, feeding tube will be pushed. I had also started having major side effects from methadone (mild seratonin syndrome???).  So after a 6-week taper from 50mg (I had month-long take homes) down to 2mg for 5 days, I jumped 4 days ago. I've also been dealing with my health conditions and many days not able to eat much so lost lots of weight.

I've been doing this with the help of my family physician.

During the end of the taper (from between 2 and 4mg of methadone), and after the jump, I've been becoming extremely weak and breathless just standing up. Is this normal? Doc has checked me out and mostly look OK, other than chronic issues that shouldn't cause this. Back 10+ years ago, I kicked oxycontin/fentanyl multiple times and it sucked but was nothing like this. But I'm also older and in poorer health.

At my request, family doc also prescribed a month's worth of clonazepam to help, which I'm thinking maybe was a mistake, since those bring along a host of side effects and withdrawals. I'm tapering now after taking 1.0mg for 2 weeks, which could also be causing some of this stuff. I'm on 0.5mg clonazepam now and will go down to 0.25mg tomorrow for 5 days, then off.

Anyway, FDA says weakness can be symptom of opiate withdrawal. What about the breathlessness? Doc's not sure.

Edit: To be clear, I'm having all the typical opiate withdrawal symptoms I've had many times before: aching, nausea, diarrhea, anxiety, yawning, chills (extreme this time), etc. It's just I've never had the weakness/breathlessness before.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64096045}"

I have been abusing codeine (prescription co-codamol and OTC Solpadine max) for around a few months, although have taken co-codamol on and off for years. These last few months have been pretty solid daily use of around 320mg codeine per day, sometimes less. I know this may be a small amount and seem like a lesser battle to some people but I‚Äôm really struggling. No-one in my life knows about this and I don‚Äôt want anyone to know.
I decided enough was enough and had my last dose at around 10am on Wednesday and haven‚Äôt had any since. By Thursday morning I had a bit of a panic attack and felt a wave of depression and anxiety wash over me. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for a year and I felt almost as bad as before I started taking them. Then came the shits, the horrendous lava shits on the hour every hour. Sweating, shivering and soaking through my clothes. 
The thing is, I could deal with all the physical stuff but this mental turmoil and feeling depressed is really the worst. I don‚Äôt want to be here and feel like this.
I have no intention of ever touching this drug again. I honestly never thought I would be an addict. I mean I don‚Äôt even have a craving or want to use again but obviously my body and brain are crying out for it. I‚Äôll never go back but just want to hear that this will get better and the depression will lift?
I‚Äôm so mad at myself for getting into this mess and would hate to think I‚Äôve ducked up all the progress I made with my mental health by fucking around with a pill that gave me a warm fuzzy feeling for like a half hour. Help please???

I just want to help others get through the dark back out into the light of dope-free living.  So my man and I been main-lining about 2 grams a day for about 3months...escalated out pressed 30s habit that spanned a while before and hit the heroin hard. 

So kick week this week, we decided to usher it in with Lsd. Now I KNOW that sounds nuts, but I will say there is REAL HEALING POWER in psychedelics. 

Did our last shot of our last gram Friday evening then ate some acid. It hit pretty good...we had this transcendent sexual experience...well I did. Had probably the BEST orgasm of my life then this emotional wave just crashed over me and all the tears, grief, anger and sadness just poured out. O shook and cried for about 30 minutes.  My guy just held me through it. It was a HEALING release like I have never experienced or seen even as a former therapist. 

You all know how powerful the mind is?  It is the MAIN driver in your withdrawal experience.  I was so afraid of kick week that my mind was putting me into withdrawal at 6am after banging a gram the day before ever kicking. But after the LSD, something happened to my mind. I truly believe that you gotta heal your soul wounds first, then your mind, and the body follows suit.  So I was determined to mind over matter my week of withdrawal. 

Last dope shot Friday evening then LSD. Saturday morning and no feelings of withdrawal yet. They start later and we got our cottons to take the edge off. 2  cotton shots Saturday and Sunday and MINIMAL withdrawal symptoms.  Monday is kinda day 3, minus the cottons.  My dude caved and got a gram. We shot it up immediately. Then hated ourselves. Then we made the choice to push harder.  So it really began Tuesday with no more cottons or dope. Mindset is good. Determined. 

Got ALL the comfort meds lined up on the table.  Robitussin with DXM, pepto, vitamins, ibuprofen,  gabapentin, Lyrica, tons of Xanax, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, ( im bipolar 1, severe according to my therapist) and a TENS machine.  You can get one for about $25. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for the restless leg and back pain. Its a lifesaver! The RLS is the worst for me. And the anxiety and depression are crushing. They break me harder than anything. I will say this. Youtube guided meditations are the only thing that can calm my mind and body.  I can sleep away day 1, but after that sleep is MINIMAL. Guided sleep hypnosis meditations are so helpful.  

FORCE yourself to get outside every day for at least a few minutes.  Force yourself to get your heart rate up for enough time to get your blood flowing stronger.  PUT YOUR BARE FEET ON THE DIRT AND GROUND YOUR FUCKING ANXIETY INTO THE EARTH!. IF you don't know what grounding your energy is, look it up. The earth releases electrons into your body. It balances your body's electric energy. 

Heal your soul, heal your mind, then your body will heal.  Listen to feel good music.  Watch movies that have a feel good vibe.  We discover the series "" The Expanse"" on prime. 5 seasons of badass sci-fi  space shit got us through until today and we have a few episodes left. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

So hear I am, Sunday morning. Yes, I prayed so much this week. I prayed to Jesus, Mother Mary, great spirit, and Thor, Odin and Freya. Christian witch. Its interesting. My soul needs both.  Its ok whomever you pray to. Just surrender your heart and let the healing energy in. Its day 5. No withdrawal symptoms left but a bit of restlessness and minimal sleep. I stopped taking the comfort meds. Hubby started his subs again.  He needs them. 35 year addict. His receptors are shot.  
I did not take and suboxone.  Fuck that shit too.. He is 50. I am 44. We are TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIIT and will die from it if we go back. I gotta be there for my son. He is my only reason. But a funny thing happened.  I have remembered I can have happiness again. Earth is a beautiful place to exist. Life is a gift.

I had a talk with myself and decided to reach out to a treatment facility so I could get back on vivitrol, they recommended suboxone but I've read so many post saying suboxone is much harder to detox off of than oxy so I chose to use vivitrol to help with the cravings. Last night I was finally able to get more than 9 hrs of sleep, which is the most I've gotten during the entire detox period. Today I'm grateful for my sobriety, for peace, for freedom, for my higher power, my support group, family/friends, and to all of my redditors that helped me get this far!",13,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7364959}"

My attempt at chipping on my 7th day clean turned into a 10 day bender. My last use was around 9pm the night before last, WD symptoms started at about 8 am yesterday and got progressively worse throughout the day. I finally fell asleep after drinking a few beers, taking a mg of xanax, 200mg of gabapentin and tons of bong hits. I didn't have the energy to take my kratom last night and I felt it this morning. I got 4 hours of good sleep then tossed and turned until it was time to get up for the day. 

Took a really hot shower, 1mg of xanax, 200mg of gabapentin, 1000mg of tylenol, 5 grams of kratom and a few bong hits before going to work. I'm so sluggish and everything aches. This is actually not as bad as the first time around, but still not pleasant.
I had to drink a C4 just to feel somewhat awake and functional due to the lack of sleep plus being in full pain all day working manual labor in 100 degree heat. It's the busiest week of the fiscal quarter coming up in 3 days so I pray I'm over the hump by then and can pull my own weight. 

I should have listened to everybody that told me not to try to chip. That I would end up stuck on those damn dirty 30's again. They were right. I was wrong, and I'm paying for it now.

I see now that the honeymoon with opiates is over. I can't take them recreationally or chip without resorting to daily use.

My car actually shit the bed and that's what drove me to quit again, CT. I couldnt get into town to meet the plug and he wouldn't come to me, so I tried to budget what I had left, and that barely went the way I hoped it would. I had planned on tapering a little more slowly but that probably would not have worked out so well.

I have a vacation that I've been looking forward to for months now coming up in 9 days. I'm done with opiates. Fuck feeling like this. I'm using that vacation as motivation to get through these physical withdrawals then I know I'll be having the most fun I've had in well over a year. 

The worst part of it, is being alone through the entirety of the detox and WD phase. Nobody knows, I lied and told my therapist that I was still just taking kratom and didnt go back to daily fent use.

Holy shit the first 2-3 weeks were hard. But today I returned from a week long camping/hiking trip in the mountains in Idaho. Floated the salmon river hiked to some hot springs, sawtooth mountains. It was the most healing thing IVE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE. Constant meditation and I was able to reflect and come to terms with some really shitty things back at home. Was served divorce papers today about an hour I got off the plane. And an hour after that instead of a needle in my arm or a beer in my hand I picked up my 30 day chip. It‚Äôs going to be okay. Not just saying that I truly feel that. My God has a plan. I also have realized some things about change, pain and growth.

I thought on one of my hikes what if what I‚Äôm seeking (peace, love, loyalty, courage, friendship,security) is also SEEKING ME. I just haven‚Äôt surrendered to receive it in a way I am not expecting.
This moment is asking me to cease resisting. It‚Äôs taking a mental and physical toll anyways. It has drained me of the precious energy I need to access a higher consciousness that recognizes the miracles when it sees one.

It is a very intense experience, but 100% worth it. Check out the ibogaine sub for more info and google it. I am not an expert on this, but I will try to explain it the best I can. Ibogaine rewires your brain in a way. It pretty much resets your neurotransmitters to pre-addiction. If you have no heart or liver problems it is very safe to do as long as you are in a legit clinic. They will take care of you the whole time. It's not cheap, but way cheaper than US rehabs. On average it's about $6-7k for a 1 week stay. It's expensive because ibogaine HCL is a very expensive substance and you have a full team taking care of you 24/7.

Im 31m and have struggled with opiate/opioid addiction the past 12 years. Before that, i smoked weed since like 15. The past year, nothing worked except slamming some type of fent, which was a real crap shoot because 1 out of 4 times, id go into toxic psychosis for 15 to 20 minutes, which freaked my family out. 
I got off the stuff about a month and a half ago, made it about 4 weeks, then relapsed for a weekend on about a g of fent. Its been like 9 days off again. Ive IVed because of how quick it makes you feel better. I was never the user who wanted to nod off and get completely lit up. Rather, i used to be able to function, to feel some sort of excitement about the day, to wash away social anxiety.
I had this realization yesterday after reading some posts here. I wanted to fuck it up again and use for like two days straight, using everything within myself to not do it. Somehow, i felt that something else was going on, like this wasnt just addiction messing with me. I found myself looking at the depression subs, and thats when it clicked.
Ive known i struggle with depression, but for some reason i just limited that to feeling sad. I had no idea all the symptoms that come along with depression. That horrible feeling waking up, knowing you arent excited about anything. Tossing and turning throughout the night. The thoughts of inadequacy around other people, like you have nothing to offer. The constant tightness in your joints. The incredibly low energy. 
Now, im very familiar with withdrawal and know how it can bring similar symptoms. But even after getting sober (2 years here, 2 years there) i still struggle with these same symptoms. I always thought i could do some sort of 12 step program and be fixed, but thats not the case. Although those programs made it much better, i still found myself dreaming of the day i could feel normal again.
I definitely reached points where i wasnt depressed in recovery, but looking back, when something really bad happens, i dont think my brain processes it the same way. I just start beating myself up mentally, and continue to do so until i basically just shut down.
When i look at the times i have been happy sober, i found something interesting. I was on what i thought at the time was a sleep med, trazedone. Come to find out, trazedone is a mild anti depressant. I had this idea around 9 months sober i wanted to be off everything, so i just stopped taking it. Within three months, i was searching for that ""im ok"" feeling again. 
I have been so focused on staying clean, ive been missing what the real issue is. I struggle with severe depression and i have since i was 15 come to think of it. I found functionality in opioids, they made me feel like life had color again. I always thought i was numbing out because thats what everyone talks about when using, but for me at least, i used just to feel something again. 
I know if i can get the depression under control, i wont feel any urge to relapse. Im going to get back on trazedone, because the long term effects of more potent anti depressants scare tf outta me. Im not naive to think ill just take that and be fine. Its still going to be hard, hard work. I see the light at the end of tunnel now though, which is dope because im fucking sick of this whack ass tunnel. 
I write this today with a sense of hope. I think i can get out of this cyclical trap. I wonder what yalls thoughts are here. Any experience with this? I wish the best to all of you. We are some tough peeps to fight our way out of addiction. Many of you have inspired me to stay strong when all i wanted was to be weak.

Good news, I have a kid on the way. Yay! 
Bad news, what started as a remedy for tooth pain and dry socket has turned into a full blown Morphine addiction. 
Specifically, they're legit Morph 60's ER. I had used no less than 30mg daily for about 3 1/2 months (snorting). 
About 20 days ago now, I started a DIY at home detox using a Methadone taper over the course of about 14 days (all I could get) and I was doing greeeaattt lowering the doses every couple of days. I reached day 14, took my last 2.5 of Methadone, and I made it through the day. 

Fast forward to day 16, I was unexpectedly hit with withdrawals. Now I'm back on the Morphine to curb it, attempting to ween off by using very very low doses. I push myself until I start to feel the symptoms in severity, then remedy it with the absolute smallest line I can make, roughly 5mg - 7.5mg. 

SO, are there any good OTC medications to mediate the withdrawals, just enough to get through the first 5 days? I suspect once I get through the worst, I'll be fine. I have the will power to cut this on my own with the support of my fiance, but what I don't want to do is rely on the healthcare system. I know EXACTLY how they treat addicts, no matter how well intentioned they are, and I need and want help - not judgement. I'm also not a fan of the idea of being denied proper healthcare in the future because I came and asked for help.

If I won a million dollars, I would have spent every single cent of it on a marvelous celebration for the union of truly golden friendship. The most precious and rarest of connections that I knew for absolutely certain was bound to last an entire lifetime (and many after).  

Sadly, so, so sadly, I was terribly wrong. We were only granted with 7 years together before you were ripped from me (and from all of us) by wretched, wretched claws into whatever it is that truly lies beyond the light.  

Now, it has been more than half of the days I was blessed to have you show me so many ways to live, which rules to obey and which ones I should break.  

Now, I think I must have cried enough tears to fill up all of the oceans on this cursed, teal and green sphere five times over (at the very least).  

I still don‚Äôt know why you are gone and I am not. I do know however, that wherever you are, though you miss me as terribly as I miss you... you are glad that I survived.  

I know that you are crying too, but your tears are of rejoice that I am living a life that honors your memory, a life that you always knew I deserved, and told me countless times.  

I know that you are sheathed in brilliant wings, surrounded on every side by brilliant auroras beyond human comprehension. I know that every time my heart skips a beat as your name is mentioned I hear your voice say softly in my head-  

*‚ÄùIt‚Äôs okay to cry, but just promise me you‚Äôll forgive yourself one day, and promise me no matter how badly you think you‚Äôve ruined everything, you‚Äôll always, always try.‚Äù*

I wrote in your eulogy that I would live for you and in the ways that you taught me. I desperately and regrettably failed at that for a very long time. I am sorry about that, just as I am sorry that I could never have saved you (though part of me still believes I should have.)  

If the roles were reversed, I never would have blamed you-and I know in my soul you have never, ever blamed me (not once, all this time.)  

And even after all this time, your absence rings in my ears like the wings of a butterfly, a sound that is felt and not heard...yet is still the most bitter, eternal, heartbreaking of sounds I have ever heard just the same.  

I look at my right wrist every day, I look and see your name. I know that through hell or high water, dark and light, death and life, you will always be by my side.  

If I close my eyes really tight it almost feels like nothing has changed at all, it almost feels as though your hand is still in mine.  

It never was goodbye, only ever until we meet again. You will always and forever (no matter how many years it‚Äôs been) be my very, very best friend.

2021-07-22 00:41:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/op6tk2/overdosing_after_falling_asleep/,Overdosing after falling asleep,"Hey guys, here's another question that I've searched and searched for but can't find anything, whether on here or on Google. Maybe I just don't know how to word it properly but it's one of my biggest fears with this stuff. 

Also, if this is not the correct sub for this just let me know and I'll remove (as even though I am trying to get sober and heading into detox in a week, the post is still about active use albeit harm reduction)

I'm an extremely cautious user, as much as I can be and for that reason I don't THINK I've ever had a legitimate overdose. As far as I know at least. 

Anyways my question is if I take my last dose of the night and get ready for bed, what possibility is there of me overdosing in my sleep and dying due to the natural body processes during sleep such as: 

Decreased heart rate
Decreased oxygen intake and therefore decreased blood oxygen levels
Not being able to adjust myself if I'm in a position that cuts off circulation, oxygen, etc

As in, while I'm awake I'm high and nodding out but I'm not really in dangerous territory, then going to sleep just pushes my breathing and heart rate ever so slightly over the line. Would I have to be like so high that I'm incoherent already? Or could I just be very high but coherent and then overdose in my sleep? What would be the warning signs of this?

I have a blood oxygen meter that I use at night before bed and I'm usually at around 97-98% with a heart rate around 60, and if I keep it on while starting to go to sleep sometimes I will look at it and the blood oxygen is down to like 85% and heart rate at 50, which scares me being the hypochondriac that I am. 

I just typed this whole thing while nodding out and it took me a long ass time, haha, but I think that it means that I'm definitely not going to overdose tonight as long as I don't take more. Honestly I think this fear just comes down to me being a hypochondriac.

It's been a tough road, I have always tried my best to support him and love him plenty but things are pretty broken because of the lack of trust, lying, turmoil from using and drinking.

Questions: he is on subutex (2 years) for the opiates and this was supposed to help him quit drinking but honestly he really thinks he's ok because, well, he's not ""using"". Our sex life is non existent, no intimacy, communication bad, he's gained a lot of weight (not being mean, just stating because he's not his healthy self), he's angrier, distant, mean at times, and honestly really pays me not much attention. 

I am starting to question my reasons for staying. I am a very attractive woman, pull my own weight financially, am responsible, loving, smart and active. I try my best to keep myself up. It just hurts, all of this-I wish i were a bottle of beer at times or a pill because he loves that first. At times I feel I am losing my mind, not so much lately but before for sure. I try talking to him but he gets defensive. 

All he says is that he loves me, doesn't want me to go anywhere and that he is trying his best. He makes good money now and has a stable job so I hold onto that but will this always be my life if I stay??

How I did it: went to NA/AA, got a sponsor and worked the steps. I also did a rapid 7day sub taper the first week(bought from a friend) to get through the worst, and then jumped cold turkey. 

The first few years I got heavily involved in the program - went to meetings everyday, gave back by helping newcomers, fellowshipped with other recovering addicts regularly (going to dinner, baseball games, cookouts, etc.) Immersing myself in the program the first few years was crucial for me and gave me the solid foundation I needed to stay clean. 

Personally, total abstinence was the only thing that worked in the long term for me to truly stay clean. I tried bartering with myself- ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only smoke weed‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only drink on weekends‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get clean by taking a bunch of psychedelics to come to the realization that I don‚Äôt need drugs‚Äù - crazy mental gymnastics I constantly used because I could not let go of escaping reality with mind altering substances. For years I made these excuses for myself, and though they might of worked in the short term- they always led me back to opiates. 

I know it sounds overwhelming, but the number one piece of advice I can give is to take it one day at a time. Tell yourself you will not use today and do not worry about tomorrow. I hope this can help anyone struggling.  If I could do it, so can you.

I‚Äôd be sober for a week and couldn‚Äôt stand the withdrawals so I would relapsed. I talked to a guy I know who quit heroin n he basically told me I was gonna have to be sick for a few weeks- maybe a month etc, I got thru the first 3 weeks soaking up my sheets with sweat feeling like I had the worst flu ever. Once the acute withdrawals subsided, I won‚Äôt lie I didn‚Äôt feel like a change man n the depression was hitting me so hard, I did other drugs like Xanax n coke, Even tho others drugs help make you feel better temporarily I realized I would most likely become addicted just like I did to opiates, for the record I have tried every drug except for crack, heroin n meth. Opiates is just my drug of choice I guess, however as someone who would consider themselves a functional addict, I‚Äôve noticed you miss out on a lot of great moments or when you think back a lot of significant events are a blur. It seems pretty obvious that drugs numb you but when you‚Äôre addicted (for me anyway) it‚Äôs hard to accept that fact because the high is so good.

said id never touch pain meds again but when i herniated a disc 3 1/2 weeks ago and was in the hospital on the floor crying and couldnt walk, that changed. they gave me dilauded in my arm. not gonna lie. took away the pain and was high for like 12 hours. definitely still liked it

&#x200B;

got a script for vicadin, norco. 5 mg. 1-2 every 4 hours...... was at about 10 a day and it was barely touching the pain. i did that for about 2 1/2 weeks and suddenly the acute phase / inflammation on nerve stopped last week. to my surprise when i didnt take any meds one day. by 7 pm i definitely felt like crap. didnt think 2 1/2 weeks could do it BUT perhaps my opiate receptors are still sensitive to this. muscle memory we will call it.....for pain receptors......also 50 mg of hydrocodone is still more than your average post surgery 2-3 hydros a day for some people. rough equivilent of 35 mg of oxycodone. nothing like my old 160-240 mg a day a habit, but still a moderate amount.

im at the point now where i can probably get away with 2 a day or maybe even as needed (usually needed at at least one point 4-5 days a week, but getting better)......and the only reason im still taking is to do a fast taper. i switched to tramadol that i bought over the counter in mexico. I live 15 minutes from there, bc ive found in the past its easier to get off of due to less euphoria. i cut from 10 to 7 immediately. Did 6, Now I'm on 5. i still feel slightly funny. my plan is to go 4.5, 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, .5 for a total of 10 more days and 34 days total on opiates.

that should be too difficult should it? any suggestions? have any former addicts had to take medication for an injury and then got off quickly?

would you guys recommend I just cut immediately and probably feel 3 days of a mild withdrawal?",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45953315}"

I'm a 25 year old woman in the UK addicted to codeine and Pregabalin. But, as with all your stories, it's a lot deeper than that. 



I read this sentence in someone else's comment and I suddenly realised how I got here. 



When the pandemic began in March 2020, I stopped going to work in the office and worked from home instead. I stopped getting up early every day, walking to work in all weathers, stopped exercising almost completely. In essence, I totally stopped tolerating any discomfort whatsoever. I lost that drive to work through discomfort and pain in order to feel the benefit of the reward at the end, whether that's through cardio and weights at the gym leading to a healthier body and mind, or a long week in the office leading to a weekend of relaxing. 


I met a drug dealer last summer and went on a multi-month binge of rotating substances including cocaine, ketamine, tramadol, valium, morphine and dihydrocodeine. I almost lost my job because I couldn't stay awake during the day - being strung out and having my bed and sofa there whilst I was supposed to be working was too tempting. I started taking pills and doing lines from the moment I woke up in the morning, answering emails and phone calls intoxicated on whatever I was addicted to in that moment. 


I was also dealing with the end of an incredibly emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. I couldn't handle the overwhelming pain, distress and despair I was feeling; the obsessive, intrusive thoughts about everything he'd done to me, and the crushing weight of my newfound loneliness. I wanted to feel dead without being dead. I wanted to feel nothing at all. 


I'm still addicted to pregabalin and codeine, and I'd been feeling really awful about myself regarding these pervading addictions recently. I still go through withdrawal at least once a month. I still feel powerless and as though my entire life is going round in circles on an endless loop of the same shit. 

I suffer very badly from mental ill health including major depressive disorder, OCD, anxiety and a dissociative disorder, which definitely complicates things. 

But - fuck, I feel a lot better for typing that out. Somehow I came back from where I was last summer. Somehow I've nearly finished my Master's in Creative Writing, somehow I kept my job in IT and even got a new weekend one at a vape shop to start building my savings back up. Somehow I've been going to the gym regularly, running 5ks and deadlifting and squatting and pushing myself to really feel pain and discomfort again. 


Everything is still messy as fuck but it's getting better. I'm on my second day of withdrawals from codeine and I'm determined to stop chasing my tail this time. I'll deal with the pregabalin addiction later.",55,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8843418}"

Coming off methadone and fucked up.,"Decided to write on here because currently I‚Äôm feeling like wanting to put a gun to my head one minute‚Ä¶. Take the rest of my Valiums the next minute (stupid AF and only have like 5 anyway)‚Ä¶ or just continue to lay in bed for several more days feeling like ass while everyone in my life is telling me what a piece of shit I am. Yay life!

Was a black tar heroin user (smoked it) who came to FL to go to rehab‚Ä¶. Of course that turned into a fentanyl addiction for years and so I went on methadone. Decided I needed to get off it because it was no longer good for me for a plethora of reasons.

So yeah I used the Bernese Method for the 2nd time to come off of Methadone (tapered down to 48mgs, inducted subs over a period of like 7 days)‚Ä¶ this time it was a lot rougher. I think because I tapered down quickly, but not that quick. I only was up to 75mgs after about a 2-3 month fent bender the last relapse before going back to the clinic in December.

Week 2 after the transition I was a wreck. Anxiety times a million, ran out of my Valium script early. Started drinking like crazy just to alleviate the anxiety because I had 2 trips coming up‚Äî an old friends bachelorette party where I‚Äôd be in a different city for 48 hours then have to fly back to be a maid of honor in my sister in laws wedding. Realized I couldn‚Äôt do any of it, panicked and checked into a semi-cushy detox. Honestly, the 10 days I was at that detox was actually one of the best times, in a way, of the past 18 months of my life. Sad, I know‚Ä¶ but I had been struggling that bad. So, playing spades, shooting the shit, chain smoking laughing and chatting with people struggling with the same shit actually helped. Not to mention some dude who paid extra to have his phone got weed thrown over the fence of the smoking patio like 3 times. Also the groups were good. I genuinely got something out of it. And the human interaction was so needed.

This pandemic has been crushingly isolating for me. I can only imagine how many other people with addictions (or not) have been impacted by this. But as a mother of a young child in an abusive marriage who has moved to a new state and knows almost no one (and my husband has no friends), it‚Äôs been fucking devastating. I‚Äôve been so, so lonely. Being a mom is a big reason I couldn‚Äôt go to long-term treatment, as much as they tried to push it‚Ä¶ but honestly I‚Äôve been to rehab so many times anyway. I know what to do, I just have to **actually do it.**

Anyway I came back and I‚Äôm disinvited from the wedding of the friends bachelorette party I missed. She was like ‚Äúomg clearly you‚Äôre on hard drugs.‚Äù Honestly I tried to explain methadone to her but just didn‚Äôt have the strength or energy to really give a shit that she was pissed I didn‚Äôt go to her fucking party when I was having a mental breakdown and needed help. I have been on methadone for the better part of the past 3 years, but don‚Äôt really divulge it to anyone, otherwise I live a normal life and own a home outright‚Ä¶ my ‚Äúdrug shit‚Äù always shocks people in a way. Ugh, normies, amiright?

I tried to explain to her that I had to go for my health‚Ä¶ she said ‚ÄúI still want to be friends but you‚Äôre clearly too unstable to come to my wedding‚Äù ‚Ä¶ first of all I‚Äôm not IN YOUR WEDDING and what do you think I‚Äôm gonna do? Not to mention she completely disregarded the fact I‚Äôve shedded out like $1000+ already on plane tickets and hotel rooms to travel to her state across the country. Which I really couldn‚Äôt even afford. Then when I said ‚Äúok we‚Äôre still going to enjoy a vacation in colorado anyway‚Äù, she scoffed like she was offended we would still use the damn plane tickets?? Oh hell no. Fuck that I‚Äôm not gonna be your friend anymore. After over a decade this is how is gonna go? Maybe I am a little ‚Äúunstable‚Äù but how is this helping as a friend to just shut me out? And you‚Äôre supposed to be my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù? Even my SIL was understanding why I had to miss her wedding and I was her maid of honor. I felt awful about that. It was soul crushing.

Now I‚Äôve just been a mess. My friend disinviting me to her wedding when I was at such a low, made me choose to cop. Yeah I fucked up. For the first time in some time (I was only taking methadone for the better part of 3 years, here and there using like maybe a handful of times each year, but it not really doing much bc a lot of effects are blocked.. so I wouldn‚Äôt do it again‚Ä¶. you know the drill when you‚Äôre on MAT). Snorted a bag and a half of fent and, from what I assume must have have happened for this injury to occur, fucking fell out from the barstool in my house I was doing the fent on.

Obviously I came to, I think I was ‚Äúout‚Äù maybe 30-45min, possibly longer but I doubt it. Possibly shorter I really don‚Äôt know. I believe I have bruised ribs because it‚Äôs been like 2 weeks since that incident and it still hurts. I haven‚Äôt been using since but still feeling physically sick‚Ä¶ pretty much refusing to take subs other than 2mg here and there if I absolutely have to. I have some Valium left, a few gabapentins left, tons of clonodine, and zanaflex (muscle relaxer). Been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol too. Unfortunately yes I‚Äôve been drinking again but honestly it‚Äôs just like white claws/twisted teas here and there. It helps dull the pain/despair at times. No hard alcohol. Honestly idk if I could stomach it. Since I can hardly even eat a damn thing.

I assume my doctor (who prescribes me subs when I need them, Valium, clonodine‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm sure will give me more gabapentin too if I ask) will help for stuff with the depression. But I‚Äôm in pain and it‚Äôs making this a lot worse. Yeah I know it‚Äôs my fault. Basically how long do bruised ribs take to heal and how can I help the recovery speed up? Should I be doing more physical activity or just resting?

Also looking for encouragement I guess. I feel like a fucking idiot. I know I am. I‚Äôm So lost. Some moments I just want to die but I have a child to live for. Sometimes I tell myself I‚Äôm strong, I‚Äôm a soldier‚Ä¶ other times I just feel pathetic and feel like I should be doing more and powering through this.

I‚Äôm NOT coming here to shit on methadone or MAT at all, it saves lives. It just wasn‚Äôt for me. Made me have the most crazy hot flashes and sweat buckets (and I already live in a state that‚Äôs hot and humid all year long) and gain weight and just feel like a piece of shit that had no joy in life anymore‚Ä¶ the side effects lowered my quality of life x100. I‚Äôve never been overweight in my life before methadone and I hardly even eat. Since coming off of it I have been losing weight which is I guess the only plus of this disaster. While I have been taking them here and there (like 2mgs of subs here and there at a time) to alleviate some symptoms of withdrawal, I do not wish to be on any maintenance anymore. Subs do nothing for me really in terms of cravings, not to mention I just have no desire to be on MAT anymore. I feel like dog shit but want to break the chains and be free of everything for good. All I know is FUCK FENTANYL,  I‚Äôm never fucking going to a clinic again, and I sure as hell am not getting dependent on an opiate (illegal or MAT) ever again. I‚Äôll deal with the Valium later I‚Äôm obviously not gonna try and stop benzos at the same time as this.

However part of me has to admit that my family played/is playing a role in my relapse. I was forced to move in with them around 2 years ago because I was attacked and the attack left me with permanent nerve damage in my arm and also because I had lost all function in my right hand. 

I was supposed to have graduated by now but the PTSD and physical barrier prevented it. I‚Äôve tried getting a job but it‚Äôs always gone one of 3 ways. Either 1. I don‚Äôt even get hired or hear back from the employer. 2. I hear back and when it‚Äôs time for the interview and they see how my hand isn‚Äôt great they don‚Äôt give me the job, or 3. I get the job but it becomes clear I cannot handle certain tasks or cannot perform as good as other people due to my hand. 

I tried school but because of covid I couldn‚Äôt get in person tutoring which I need because I suck at math and I can‚Äôt afford private classes. I managed to go cold turkey from fent but it was always on the back of my mind. Lately my family has been talking down to me. 

The other day I was at my moms as she made one of my favorite dishes. My sibling came out as well and they started talking politics. Usually I don‚Äôt care for it but my sibling kept asking who I voted for and what party I was for. I finally said I didn‚Äôt vote for anyone because I wasn‚Äôt going to vote for the lesser of two evils and that I didn‚Äôt agree on a certain parties stance on guns. 

Just as I‚Äôm about to bite into my food my sibling said ‚ÄúWow imagine being a republican without a job or without going to school‚Äù in such a condescending tone. That instantly made me feel like shit so I left to my room and I hear them say ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt imagine being that age and still relying on your parents to help you‚Äù and my mom laughed and agreed with her. 

Everytime they go to my gmas they talk even more crap about me and I only know because my gma tells me.  My mom doesn‚Äôt even answer anymore. I was calling every 15 minutes because I needed an urgent ride to the doctors and she wouldn‚Äôt answer but as soon as my younger sibling called she answered right away. 

Now to what finally broke me. The only thing I have of any kind of value even though it‚Äôs small is my old Xbox. My siblings dog chewed up all the wires and it no longer works. My dad just told me oh well it‚Äôs not my problem. Finally after weeks of me just being stuck in depression my dad tells me ‚Äúyou can order a new console‚Äù right as he says this my sibling gets up and tells him ‚Äúno he doesn‚Äôt deserve shit he doesn‚Äôt do shit but sit on his ass‚Äù I tried saying my arm has made it extremely hard to do much of anything before they shut me down and said they don‚Äôt care about my arm. My dad agreed with them and that just broke me. 

I cried and cried that night I even cut myself deeper than I ever had before and the physical pain made the emotional pain not so bad. Around 2 A.M I couldn‚Äôt cope anymore. I was going to kill myself. Before I was able to follow through I opened snap and saw someone selling their script of norcos and I popped and popped until I was throwing up violently and nodding off.

When I first started suboxone it was great. I felt great, only needed one dose a day, it lasted forever, and I felt no need for any other drugs. At this point I don't even like to drink, take benzos, smoke weed, or do any drugs, but I am getting urges to use opiates again. I wake up and feel the withdrawal coming on. I feel awful, some days are better than others. I have to take a bit in the morning. I am currently Prescribed 12mg per day. That was just changed a few days ago, but I'm struggling to have myself take the full dose because I feel I'm already building a tolerance. For the past three months my dose has been 8mg. For the same reasons i tried not to take the whole thing. I would generally only take half (4mg) total per day, but then it went to 5mg then 6mg and I am having to take 1-2mg in the morning then 3-5mg in the evening or late afternoon or else the symptoms creep in. I am worried that suboxone isn't working as it should. I talked to my provider and she raised my dose to 12mg, but I just couldn't tell them I am taking a small dose in the morning too because I am only supposed to take it once a day. If I did take it once per day I would feel awful. Is it okay to take a small dose in the morning? Is it normal to feel a tolerance and need to raise my dose? Should I try just taking the full 12mg dose at once and see if it actually helps for 24 hours? I feel stuck and like an addict still.

For the rest of us, we know that Suboxone is massively powerful even as a partial opioid agonist. Its metabolite nubuprenorphine is a full opioid agonist and thought by some to be responsible for its recreational benefits, especially in non-tolerant users.

There have been numerous reports of people smoking Suboxone pills. Hopefully I don't have to educate anyone about how unhealthy and dangerous it is to smoke pills. However, I remained curious as to the bioavailability of smoked buprenorphine and thought to do something that I am yet to see discussed anywhere, a cold-water extraction on a 2mg Suboxone pill.

So I did. Dissolved the pill in water, filtered it twice, poured the remaining ML or so of liquid into a glass ball pipe. Evaporated the excess, inhaled the rest.

Verdict: Vaping buprenorphine *definitely* works. There's no way in hell this was a placebo. I'm *very* experienced with opiates having been addicted for 10+ years, on and off. I know if my receptors are being tickled or not. This did more than tickle them.

Was it as potent as something like heroin? Obviously not. But nonetheless I got high enough that I felt it necessary to inform the world. 

Again please don't reply with anything along the lines of ""this is dumb,"" or ""this doesn't work,"" because it's well-established that a) yes, smoking pills is dumb, thus a cold-water extraction is a viable harm-reduction approach for those who remain determined to do so, and b) yes, it does work, buprenorphine is well-known to be active on its own and is even prescribed as a painkiller in some opioid naive patients.",0,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4670026}"

If anyone writes, draws, doodles, sketches, anything - I would love to make a collaborative zine about all things recovery. I would design the layout of the pages and add maybe one piece about my experience with opiates. The rest would be others pieces, with usernames or names as credits (or anonymous). I would be so grateful for anyone who wants to participate, and I will happily post the zine online for anyone to download, print, and share when it's complete. I will gladly send them in the mail too if anyone wants to receive one that way. I haven't sorted out logistics, this is just a pitch - and moderators, please let me know if this is aloud, I want to uplift the people in this community, not cause harm in any way. I want to do this the right way so if anyone has a problem with this please message me.",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8623291}"

I‚Äôm day 18 clean, I was taking 80-120 mg of Oxy a day but I tapered down with Kratom before jumping off. Here‚Äôs what helped during withdrawals:

- Liposomal Vitamin C (4000mg every 4-6 hours for the first 2 weeks) takes away basically 100% of the flu-like symptoms aside from occasional sneezes. Total godsend, must have for withdrawals. Be sure to get Liposomal Vit C, other kinds of Vit C can be acidic and not great at taking in high doses 

- Loperamide (2mg every 4-6 hours for the first 2 weeks) takes away 90% of the stomach/bathroom issues for me, total godsend, must have. Stop taking after you‚Äôre 2 weeks clean though, you don‚Äôt want your stomach to get dependent on it 

- Magnesium Citrate helps a good bit with restless legs. I haven‚Äôt found a ‚Äòget out of jail free card‚Äô with RLS though, nothing really takes it away completely, but Magnesium helps enough that it‚Äôs totally worth taking

- Black Seed Oil also helps with restless legs a decent bit. Nothing too miraculous but when the RLS get unbearable, this helps bring it down to a manageable level. 

- Wim Hof breathing. Just YouTube it and do the beginner exercise. It‚Äôs just breathing. Might not be everybody‚Äôs cup of tea but I highly recommend it, any time the doom/dread of withdrawals became unbearable I would do some Wim Hof breathing and it would totally soothe me

- go outside and walk around somewhere, even if it‚Äôs just the dollar store to buy some water. It‚Äôs natural to spend most of the day inside while detoxing, just be sure to go out at least once a day, helps with the doom and claustrophobia 

All this combined made withdrawals totally manageable for me. It‚Äôs still withdrawals, it still sucks, but you can cut the suffering in half. 

Everything I listed is something that 100% helped, I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time or yours by recommending something that didn‚Äôt make a noticeable difference. Best of luck guys!",33,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45145124}"

When I would take Norco for some reason I would scroll hear and read these stories while fully knowing they won't affect me. One statement that I read for years but didn't understand was ""the demon grip of opiates is something different"". I would easily stop the 80mg Norco when I wanted and switch to adderall/gabapentin when I wanted. I thought I was either immune or stronger. Of course I'd be a little uncomfortable but nothing more. The past three months I was up to 180mg a day. I spontaneously quit two days ago and I've never felt pain like this before.

 if anyone has any advice on the best way to talk to my bosses about this; if anyone has knowledge on the laws in Florida about how I'm protected, etc. I know that as long as I'm the one who brings my addiction to light (rather than being caught or failing a drug test) then I'm supposedly protected from being fired, but I'm not exactly sure how it works.

Before I began Recovery Dharma I had never meditated in my life, so don't be fooled into thinking you need to be some spiritual or Buddhist monk to participate and receive the benefits of meditation - that's simply false. 

Below is a 20 minute R.A.I.N (recognize, allow, investigate, nurture) meditation. It was one of the first one's I did, and it absolutely opened my eyes and showed me so many feelings and emotions I had hurried under my addiction. And admittedly most of them revolved around self loathing, shame and guilt. For all the lies I told, the money I spent, the people I pushed away... the list goes on. 

Recognizing those emotions and where they stem from is how you can begin healing them. Meditation is primarily based around the Buddhist principals of compassion, forgiveness, gratitude and kindness.

I hope this can help someone else begin their journey of healing üíú

I am in day 1 feeling pretty bad.  Which makes me wonder how bad this is about to be? I‚Äôve kicked suboxone before. I was on MAT for 5 years. I got myself off and stayed clean for 4.  Now here I am strung out as can be.  I know it won‚Äôt last forever but it sure seems like it will.  That is the scary part of all this.  The misery of withdrawals.  I‚Äôve really been foolish for like 6 months.  

Day 1) Taking Gabapentin I‚Äôve had 1200mg so far today.  Will probably take 1800-2400mg today. Had half of a kratom
OPM shot.  I feel like shit, but I have been worse.  This is about to be quite the ride.



Day 2 
Vision is shitty. That is probably the Xanax and gabapentin. Feeling like hell to be honest.  I had RLS for a while last night.  It finally subsided after I had some more gabapentin and Xanax.  Not sure what time that was.  I just feel bad as hell.  Just had some more gabapentin and some more vitamin C. I tried to load up on it in advance but I dropped the ball yesterday. I am back at on it to day. I‚Äôve has 10kmg so far.  I‚Äôve taken Imodium twice.  I‚Äôve had a little bit of diarrhea.  Anyway this is the mid day update.

Day 2 update 

So I‚Äôve had 1800mg of gabapentin I‚Äôll have 2400 total.  
I‚Äôve had one Kratom OPM shot, won‚Äôt have anymore of that today.  It worked amazingly well, for sure don‚Äôt want to use that tool too much.  I‚Äôve taken 2mg of Xanax total for the day. I fucking hate the way it makes me feel. Those of you addicted to that one puzzle me, but I digress.   

Day 3.  Still hanging tough over here. I‚Äôd love some 30‚Äôs right about now.  The cravings are obscene. I‚Äôve had 5 Kratom capsules and 1200mg of gabapentin so far. I laid off the Xanax.  It made me feel like shit. I went to the gym today and worked shoulders. Tomorrow is legs and a short bike ride.  I gotta pretend to be me until I am me again.  I will update everyone later.

Day 4  Doing much much better.  Had a slip up last night. Found a whole pill and snorted half of it. I was able to toss the other half. I was tripping at first then I realized that going CT from 5-7 pills a day down to nothing for 3 days is a big deal in the painful world of short acting agonist withdrawal.  So, I went my ass to sleep.  Woke up this morning and I am ok.  Lesson learned, don‚Äôt be so focused on the knockout that you forget and punch yourself out before the fight is over.   Honestly for me, the short break was needed I slept 8 full hours and I don‚Äôt have crazy symptoms this morning. In fact, this is the best I‚Äôve felt in MONTHS.  This is far better than being high.  It has been quite a long time since I was able to stand being in my own skin.  I had 5 Kratom capsules a few minutes ago.  Now I am going to have breakfast. Hate that I had that 1/2 of a pill last night, but I am not going to beat myself up over it and make myself feel like a loser.  I am winning and winning is what I need right now.  I am not perfect, I never was and I never will be.  No gabapentin so far today. No Xanax in over 24 hours.  I had 5 capsules of kratom this morning with my coffee.  I need to taper that down now. Should not be bad as I have not been on it a week yet.  I also used very very little.  I did not let my comfort meds take away to much of the pain. I just kept myself at a level that was below my ‚Äúimma quit this bullshit‚Äù level.

Day 5

Today was a great day   I had 12 capsules Kratom split over 2 doses.  Felt some fatigue today in the morning and late afternoon. I feel a bit of restlessness but not too bad. I may take some Kratom I may not.  All and all kicking the dirty 30‚Äôs with the neurotin and Kratom was pretty easy.  Now to stay clean‚Ä¶..",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7983125}"

So she usually tries to get something other xan because apparently it won't show on the UAs at the clinic, so she doesn't wanna fail both because the risking of dropping phases and there's also something to do with her license...I'm trying to convince her to use kratom to bridge the gap til she can safely take buprenorphine and then taper from that without worrying about UAs and all that.

2021-07-11 13:08:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/oi8c1s/our_story/,Our story,"     My wife and I were heavy fet users daily for almost 3 years. My wife has severe pelvic pain and endometriosis, we saw every doctor within 2 states. Finally got into a pain clinic that put her on fet patches. Long story short we had our honeymoon in Cancun,  partied with some white girl and some speedy rolls. Came home she took a piss test at the clinic a week later the yayo still showed up. They said they needed 6 months of clean tests before they would put her back on the patches. We decided to have a baby because they say that can cure endometriosis .
     We had a beautiful baby girl and she felt fine for a couple weeks. I grabbed some 30s to ease her pain because we were formula feeding the baby. I got hooked on the 30s as well, justifying my back hurting from physical labor I was doing. We decided to stop and it was rough but we made it to 3 weeks clean.
      A few weeks later a friend called me seeing if he could grab a half pound so I played middle man and brought him to my boys house.  He called me mad saying it was 3 ounces short and he was  coming back to handle business.  I smoothed it over before any violence occurred and got him his 3 ounces plus some. When he was leaving he handed me 2 little .5 bags. I said what's that he said dope samples to give to your ppl. I was 3 weeks clean at this point and I knew the kids selling the bud had already been to rehab and I didn't want them to relapse cause of me.  I said take one back and I'll keep one for all the hassle. Worst decision of my life.
     Went full swing into presses then straight fet powder. Also my drug dealers were good and fast and too easy. People suspected us but never said anything. Sat my parents down last week and told them we needed help. They're amazing people and have stayed with us the whole time. We looked up rapid detox and insurance didn't cover it. So we were looking at like 40 grand plus plane tickets for 2 of us.
     We then found the Coleman Institute. The ppl are amazing and insurance covers most of it. It's an outpatient so we're staying in a hotel 8 minutes from the institute. They hit you with micrograms of naloxone every day for 5 days upping it every day. The rooms are comfortable and you can walk Laps when your restless. Plus your only in there for 2 to 3 hours a day and when you leave you feel normal and they send you home with comfort meds.
    I just figured I'd write this and it may never get read or it may help one person and if it does then it was worth it . I have one day left where they hit me with narcan so they make sure all the receptors are cleared. I'm excited and scared and ready to start my new life not spending over $1000 a week on fet and God know what else. When they did the piss test they found Molly in my system and my wife  too when we  haven't touched Molly in 6 years.

Being able to enjoy the simple things in life and celebrate all milestones no matter how big or small they might be. Most importantly I'm looking forward to being able to get through each day without having to take a pill to get started. As I sit here reflecting over these last 2 years I realized just how out of control my addiction had gotten. I would go through my 90 oxy 20s that were prescribed and was having to grab them from the streets. When I got discharged from my Dr office to prevent the withdrawals I was having to buy to avoid being in pain. In 1 week I spend $1500 easy just to be able to get through each day. I know I've spent well over 7k since 2021 has started. That could've been in my savings plus helping to pay off student loans. I like many have said was a functioning addict, I would work each day, or most days (even though I didn't want to) I paid my bills, hung with friends periodically. But I started isolating myself again which should've been red flag #1 but I didn't realize it bc of the quarantine and this fake ass plandemic that's going on. It's sad the government has made it difficult for people to get their pain meds they need causing people to turn to the streets in order to make it through each day. If they made opiates available to those that need it, so many lives would've been saved , people wouldn't be turning to the streets and taking a risk. We know the risk of buying pills off the street, but when you're in withdrawals the only thing you want or are thinking about is getting relief. But anyway, I wanted to post bc I need advice to know if there's anything I need to buy to make these next few weeks a little less intense and painful. I have gabepentin 600mg, ibuprofen 800mg and also muscle relaxers. I stopped and grabbed cranberry juice, water, Gatorade and body armor today. I know I won't have an appetite at all nor will I be thirsty but I'm gonna attempt to drink as much fluids as I can. I know I will be uncomfortable and there will be pain, but is there anything else I need or anything else I can do for the first week and especially the first few days that will help? I don't have any benzos unfortunately, I will try to remember to take my vitamins daily. I have kratom and also 1 suboxone strip but I've been told to stay away from those as well as seroquel bc it will make the RLS worse.

My girlfriend called me an addict during a small arguement. I need help. How do i 
explain how not cool and fucked up that is? Ill break it down. 

I used heroin for about 4 or 5 years, on and off. I went to detox on december 13th, 2017, and ive been on suboxone ever since. I started on 22mg and weened down to 4mg. Ive been on 4mg for like 2 years. She doesnt like the fact that im on suboxone, but thats another post for another time. 

I was trying to get our son to eat green beans, and told him to take 3 more bites before the grilled cheese. It turned into a tantrum and my girlfriend got upset. 

This turned into her saying something about ""youre nodding off on the couch during our online parenting class because youre an addict"" she claims i nod off on 4mg of suboxone. And we had an online class to learn about parenting techniques. 

I didn't close my eyes during the class. However, i do sit or lay back and rest my eyes somewhat often, although i dont fall asleep. Me feeling tired and resting my eyes during the day has been a thing for as long as i can remember. Way before i ever used an opiate. Never more than an hour. Or 45 minutes even. Weve discussed how i have anxiety issues, and fatigue can be a symptom. 

I told her how upset and shocked i am about her calling me that, especially considering shes a mental health counselor, and has had addiction struggles in her past. She replied by telling me im akin to dating a girl.

It all started 5 years ago when there was some leftover Percocet in my parents  kitchen. I never had any previous experience with painkillers, only  taking what was prescribed to me post-surgery or after an injury. I took  2 of the Percocet and my mind was blown. I have never experienced such a  feeling before in my life and needed to know where I could get more.  Fortunately for me (but unfortunately for me in the long run) I had a  connection where I could get about 50 once a month, which would  typically last me a week or longer.  This was all fine and dandy for a  year or so, once I finished my batch I would only get the cravings for  about an hour after and then I was fine to go the next 3-4 weeks without  any. Next is where it starts to turn..

The hour long cravings started to become 2 hours long, then 4 hours etc. I needed to find a way to get that feeling again but no way to get Perocet as I wasn't willing to go searching for it. My mom had some leftover  Tylenol 3 from a dental surgery and I decided to try that. The feeling  was amazing - not quite as amazing as the Percocet but enough to get me through the days. It started off with 3 every day as the high would last  me hours, and then gradually increased as any opiate addiction does, to  the point where I needed 14 Tylenol 3's to feel anything.

I eventually got a prescription from my doctor for 300 Tylenol 3's per month. As you can imagine this was not lasting me the entire month, and I  spent days in withdrawal agony before my next dose. I was at the point of doing around 28 Tylenol 3's per day, no Cold Water Extraction, so I can't even imagine the damage I was doing to myself with all the APAP.  The high was more important to me than the damage to my body, so I  continued this path for about 4 more years, until about April of this  year.

I was at the point where I was sick of having to go through withdrawal and what the pills were doing to my body, so I searched for  alternatives. I saw many posts about Kratom but never really took any  interest in it. I finally decided to try it, and it took a few times  before I could figure out why this would be a good replacement, but  finally I found the benefits. I have been taking Kratom for close to 3  months now and for the first time in 5 years, I haven't touched codeine in the months I've been taking it, nor have I even had a thought about it. My plan is to eventually taper off of the Kratom, but for now it has been a tremendous help in getting away from the pills.

That is my (long) story. Thank you for reading if you got this far. I thought I would share this and hope to help anyone that is considering making the switch away from opiates.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46868736}"

Heroin is the demon that I‚Äôve been battling with for the past 5 years. In the past I‚Äôve always gotten ‚Äúsober‚Äù via suboxone maintenance.

Odd dreams?,"Going into day 5 and the last two nights I've had some very vivid dreams that were odd as hell. I barely dreamed over the last 10 years thanks to daily cannabis use, they got crazy early in the year when my doctor put me on antidepressants. After I quit those I went back to probably 70% less dreaming, still there but not nearly as vivid, crazy, or plain fucked up.

The night before last I had a dream that a friend was showing me a huge bag of pressies, one fell out onto my lap and it was a glorious moment, I quickly hid the one that had fallen out, intending on using it and the dream ended there. Obvious where my head is at right now.

Last night was a whole different ballgame though. To make a long story short, (back story to the dream) a little over a year ago my good friend of 20 years suffered multiple strokes and seizures as the result of a blood infection from shooting coke, endocarditis. I found him barely alive and successfully preformed 30 minutes of CPR. He's alive today and clean, thank god. I held my shit together for 4 or 5 days of him being in the Neuro ICU, while his family flew in from clear across the country, I was in shock but I felt I needed to be strong for his family. I broke down on night 4 or 5 to his dad who has known me just as long as I've known his son, he hugged me and told me I did what I could and more than I ever should have needed to, and thanked me for the 100th time in the last few days. 

This is where last nights dreams got weird. It started off with my friend's dad somehow replacing my current boss who is driving his own business into the ground, and we spoke and he assured me that we would get things back on track. That somehow transitioned to being back in my hometown with my friend and his parents. I was getting out of my car to go meet my friend and he walked up with a syringe loaded with dope and his signature plastic water bottle. I remember trying to get the words out begging him not to use, that it would likely kill him, but the words never came out and his parent's walked around the corner, saw what he had, walked him away and that's when I woke up. 

Is an increase in dreaming or having really vivid dreams a common occurrence during Acute Withdrawal? I know some people are wondering how in the hell I'm sleeping at only a few days in, I'm not really sure myself, but I'm not gonna complain.

I plan on starting my subs tomorrow night and hope to just rapid taper off two 8mg strips then cold turkey with my comfort meds and maybe occasional kratom from there. 

Anyway to the main point, I tapered myself down to about less than one fent 30 a day and the night before last I probably smoked half of one n today I probably smoked half split up into like 4 seshes. I woke up in withdrawls at like 9:30 pm after going to sleep around 10am and I smoked my last piece of a 30 which was like 2 small hits and it didn't really do much for the withdrawls. 

Can I take a piece at around 10  am tomorrow morning and not be sent into PWD? Or should I wait at least 36 hours? The way I start my induction with a rapid taper I use the least amount needed, so just doing .5mg each time and waiting 30 mins to 45 until it's bearable. Cause I'm almost considering to try and induce as soon as possible so I don't break and go pick up,and I don't know if I can wait 36 hours. At least if I do WD I'll know know that I gotta wait longer than 12 hours when .5 makes me worse than I felt before I took I guess? 

Hoping to start with just 1mg so that I have enough subs for this nd the withdrawl symptoms are not as bad at lower doses. I like to start my sub dose really low cause the taper is easier n a lil slower cause it allows me to have time to get down to like .1mg before jumping off, cause the main important part of the rapid taper is to stay on subs the least amount of time possible.

""Tomorrow you can use, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT STAYING SOBER TOMORROW...but just don't use tonight.  Can you do that?  Can you just not use right now and wait until tomorrow?""  In that moment I would take a deep breath and say ""yeah, I CAN make it through tonight.  And as you can image, this same quote was repeated the day after as well.  Sometimes the thought of never using again is so powerful, so overwhelming it can seem impossible and lead to a relapse because one can so easily think ""there is just no way I can never use again"". Chunking down to a short time and saying I just won't use right NOW and I don't have to worry about tomorrow can be a powerful tool to get through cravings.  Sometimes we take it one day at a time..sometimes one minute at a time.

*I am reminded of this because....*

I posted yesterday how I am tapering off fent and many replies were ""bro, that's a pipe dream"".  ""Dude, you can't taper...if you're an addict you won't be able to"".  ""I'm sorry to say, but tapering doesn't work.  You will only use and then take too much and OD"".  I then thought about how I'll handle cravings during this time and I remembered the quote above.  All I have to do is the follow the plan TODAY.  I was allowed 8 pills in today's taper and ending with only taking 7.  And if I want to get high tomorrow I'll do it...I just won't use TONIGHT and I am doing it with a smile on my face.

Oh also, to those haters who say I can't taper down to 1 pill a day and then jump so I avoid WD...WATCH ME MOTHER FUCKERS!  You haven't seen determination like this in your whole life so grab pen and paper and take notes. ;)

Well, it wasn't fucked up while I was having it which makes it all the more fucked up. I was at some type of immersive amusement park situation with my friends and somehow ran into R. I was still w G in the dream, and R had a gf in it too, but for whatever reason they weren't there and R was tryna get me to hook up w him and also to drink some weird oxy soup (y'all know how dreams are lol) w him. The worst part about it is that in it he acted the way he did when we first started dating- chill, funny, rolling w the punches of life, etc. Im like terrified and disgusted that my brain dreamed that, and especially that my dream self didn't like run away from him immediately like wtf. He (in real life) stalked my reddit account for a hot minute which is one of the reasons I stopped posting on here or really at all for a while. I wonder if he still does, I doubt it. Just thinking of him and esp doing drugs w him makes my skin fucking crawl. I hope the dream starts to fade more soon like my dreams usually do.

Had the doctors appt for my back yesterday, it went alright, she prescribed me gabapentin but since my insurance would only cover the 100s imma prolly end up going thru those kinda quickly on days I work. She also ordered xrays of my lower back and mentioned it could be sciatica. Omg, and in weirder news, I found a goddamn baby lizard in my house plants while watering them yesterday!! That was a whole thing that I won't get into but it's so cute and finding it was a fucking trip (I live in a part of the country where lizards do not exist in the wild or as house pests). Today im meeting up w one of my homegirls whos apt hunting to check out this apt p near me, she really likes it and I hope she gets it because it does suck having none of my best friends live close to me anymore. I should also really tidy up my house but it's hard being in so much pain. At least I watered all my plants and waxed my eyebrows/painted my toes yesterday, makes me feel minorly productive.

After trying to induct on Suboxone (unsuccessfully) after 1 year of fent use, I am switching to this group (first time poster here, please be gentle lol) as Suboxone is (*unfortunately?*) not my answer.  I tried the Bernese method with my doctor which is micro dosing to slowly build a tolerance to bupe while tapering off the fent to avoid PWD (in case anyone was unaware) but after reaching 8mg and dropping fent per protocol, I had a horrible 4.5 days before caving and picking up last night as my job was in serious jeopardy and this is the best/highest paying job I've ever had which affords a comfortable lifestyle I scared to death to lose.  While my job is a HUGE part of why I am trying to get sober, my self love, health, and family are equal motivators.  Right now, I am truly on the verge of trying to reclaim the life I have spent over a decade building OR shattering the lives of everyone around me if I can't get this right.  This is a defining chapter of my life.  I am standing on a cliff and I can see the ground and I truly don't want to fall.

***My Story***: Late 30's, and got sober when I was 24.  Was sober for 14 wonderful years where my life was put together with such beautiful design.  I got sober after spending a full year in jail for a drug related crime, got out and finished college, working as a case manager FOR the same rehab I went to as a part time job.  (not my career path, I just did it to give back some of what was given to me) somehow despite a record was given an unbelievable opportunity which opened other doors me and got a great job which affords a comfortable lifestyle. (if you are reading this and scared your record might hold you back forever, I am proof that is FALSE.  You **CAN** be very successful in this life despite a record)

Single currently but have had a few really great relationships with some amazing women I will forever cherish my time with.  Life was great and I truly enjoyed everything sobriety has to offer.  My relationship with my family has gone from ostrasized to being re kindled and became stronger than ever....I felt strong, proud of my sobriety, and truly loved the person I was until I relapsed last year with some heavy stress related to a COVID loss and being in a new city neglecting the tools that kept me sober to build this new life.  No excuses, I fell down and owning every bit of this and trying to stand back up before I lose it all.

***Why am I here, why am I posting?*** I have a LOT to lose and I'm ready to fight hard but I'm in a tough place, struggling...walking a fine line of embracing a life I dreamed of and actually built to shattering the hearts and tearing down the worlds of everyone around me who supported me if I can't get this right and they find out.  Right now, it's been a year of depression, faking smiles, and LUCKILY the only consequence has been a lot of money wasted.

I am excited to be sober (legit amped up and can't wait), except I ... CAN'T ... GET ... PASSED ... WITHDRAWAL!  I have tried cold turkey and lasted 5 days, used for 3 more months and tried methadone and it didn't feel right so used another 3 months, this time...I tried Suboxone and my doctor agreed the fent stored in my fat cells must be deep and even 10 days of Suboxone couldn't do the trick. (which is wild because I exercise 6x a week and have low body fat and eat healthy.  Even in addiction I use gym almost daily)  Every time I dosed even 4 and a half days after last fent use I felt HORRIBLE WD.  So this is my last plan...taper!  It's risky, I know the odds, but if there's 1% that can do it...I am fighting for my life to be in that percentage.  I have been clean before and know I can do it again, just not alone and that's why I'm here because I can't turn to family or friends...I feel alone in this fight and I know how toxic that can be. **As to the taper...I ordered a kitchen locked safe where I can open daily, take my pills, and then lock it back up for another 24 hours**.  It's actually not a bad plan I'm praying haha

I currently have enough pills where my doctor and I created a very specific 6 week tapering protocol here ([https://imgur.com/a/zbT0ZiG](https://imgur.com/a/zbT0ZiG))  (if anyone cared to read) that would most definitely eliminate 95% of any WD from whatever poison is in these pills.  I know sobriety is ALWAYS priority #1, but I can't be sick for another 10 days which my doctor said it might have taken on subs which is why I did not keep fighting through this.  Just yesterday morning I barely had energy to eat even after being on day 5 and almost 2 weeks of building Suboxone...my job was on the line and I just caved. My taper begins at half the dosage of my previous daily use and taking orally vs snorting.  I have no illusions tapering is easy, I know this will require will power that most addicts (especially early) do not have.  I am willing to fight through a little sickness everyday to get this out of my system and just take enough to not be in WD but even feeling crappy for a few weeks until I stabilize on a low oral dose is a blessing compared to past 5 days.

***To end this crazy long post*** lol....while I am trying to reclaim my life and self love, I have not forgot the lessons of staying sober I once learned and will be checking in often to share where I can, although I know I know I need to re learn, and listen again myself.  I don't know you all, but I have love for all of you...and looking for a little love back right now!  Thanks for listening.

We eventually got a three bedroom mobile home. The location was out of the way and it was more like a two bedroom since one room had possible mold and we didn't use it for anything other than storage. Bills were roughly:

$850 / month rent
$150 / month power
$150 / month power 
$300-$500 / month groceries 
$50/month diapers 
$50/month formula 

And then to top it all I was an opiate addict. Probably $100/day. I don't even know how I afforded that but an addict always finds a way. 

Anyways, we couldn't keep living in a billingual province while only speaking one language. There was no job opportunities for us. We could never advance. 

So how did we save up money to move? We didn't. We filed for my son's child DTC and that was enough money from the backpay to buy a ford escape for 7k cash and move out west. Backpay was roughly $26k. 

When I moved here I got a job immediately. That was important to me so I could claim moving expenses at tax time. I ended up having 13k to claim with 8k rolling over into 2020 tax season. 

So my first job was at Slim Morton's. I didn't like it at all. Zero training and extremely busy. I had anxiety everyday before work. Wanted to quit so many times. Once I learned soup and sandwich I really wanted to quit. They only put one person in SS meanwhile you have drive thru and inside orders. The drive thru takes priority so you have guests standing there watching you actively avoid making their order. Plus they use real dishes and it slows the process down for indoors. 

Anyways. I couldn't stay there. My man got a good job trucking and all was well. Without getting off track I will just say he lost his job due to my ex friends making up lies and getting him fired even though he was our only income source. I will save that story for the comment section if anyone shows interest. 

Anyways, then covid happened. We got lucky that we qualified for the Canada emergency response benefit and we took advantage of that. 

So I recently got hired at a great job. And things are looking up as they have been for the past year. 

We purchased 100 chicks at the start of the pandemic. We sold the males for meat and kept the females for chickens. WE CANNOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND. we've been expanding every chance we get. We expanded to turkeys this year. 

We sell our eggs for $3/dozen (for comparison they sell for $3-7 here) We sell our chickens for $15 not dressed or $20 dressed. 

Our turkeys we will sell for $20-$30 depending on competition and interest. We have a lot of them spoken for so we are looking into getting more. They are so so much fun. I highly recommend them. They are dumb as nails but the entertainment value alone is worth it. We had three accidentally commit suicide. As I said they aren't smart. 

Our breakdown is as follows: 

$1200 rent for a 3bedroom acreage on 160 acres. 
$150 power per month 
$150 heat per month 
$400 cigarettes I know üòí
$250 weed I replaced all my addictions and only smoke cannabis
$750 groceries for a family of 4 
$50 fast food
$300-500 to savings 
$300 farm supplies including feed and seeds 

I make roughly $19/hr at my full-time job and I make $18/hr at my part time job. I also just took my SellSafe to get a third job at a dispensary. 

My fiance is making a killing with the farm stuff. We want to buy a semi truck down the road and have him haul his own loads. For now though it's keeping him busy. 

We are currently saving for our wedding, a second vehicle, and a down payment on a house. Keeping an eye on used semi trucks for sale. 

We are actively working on fixing our credit. Joined a few groups on fbook like road to 750 and just took their advice. We waited for anything really bad to fall off our credit report - like I have a repo from age 18 on there (^thanks drugs) and that finally fell off. I hope after two years or good employment history I will qualify for a mortgage. 

I may or may not get a huge promotion. We are in the midst of negotiations. If I do - I will be making double what I was bringing home and get good benefits. It feels good to be recognized for my hard work. 

Also - my friend and I are opening our own non profit in Canada and the USA. It's going to focus on helping woman in recovery. We currently run an all woman's addiction support group on Facebook's and we have 23k members. This Reddit account is new and it's us expanding into other social media. We just completed the research and funding stage and are now starting the paperwork process. 

Tldr: I was an addict and struggling. Now I am in recovery and doing better.

Edit to add: I forgot fuel and insurance. My vehicle insurance is $120/month. We spend about $400-$600 on fuel because we do a lot of driving. We collect points and bonuses by paying for gas with our C.C. and using our points card with it. 

Car maintenance wise we do our scheduled oil changes ourselves, ask my dad to fix any major problems, buy the parts ourselves and just pay for labor in the shop if we absolutely must and then also buy a set of winter studded snow tires and swap those out each spring fall because the winters are tretcherous here. 

Also didn't include our C.C payment which can range from $50-$1100. We only use the card to get bonuses and rebuild credit. We pay the card off completely each month after it reports to the credit card company.",7,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5425397}"

I commented on a post earlier about a scary (fetal)life threatening misconception about Suboxone vs subutex and when it‚Äôs safe to take them. 
As a recovery addict of 10 years I have to pass along this info..


If you are currently addicted to opiates and pregnant please k ow you cannot take subutex sooner than Suboxone and the nalaxone is NOT what causes precipitated withdrawals it‚Äôs the buprenorphine that kicks all opiates off your receptors causing immediate full withdrawal I‚Äôve experienced 3x and am traumatized from them. If addicted to fentanyl you MUST wait 4-5 days. When in addiction I tried to take it at 3 and 4 days resulting in PWD I found 5 days safe. Most physicians do not know about this phenomenon or much about that crap fentanyl. 
However please do not be scared to be completely open and honest with your doctor no matter the situation. Mine was very understanding and well educated on Suboxone or MAT in general during pregnancy. With the epidemic the last few years physicians are educated now more than ever and do not judge as (me being proof becoming addicted because of the massive amounts of opiates I was being prescribed after have 35+ blood clots in my lungs 10 years ago) no one is safe there‚Äôs no stereotype anymore. It‚Äôs not about just you anymore so if you have to swallow the fear and pride and trust your doctor if you don‚Äôt or feel judged‚Ä¶switch! This is YOUR pregnancy and your life, you do what‚Äôs best for you and your unborn or soon to be child.",1,{'epidemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46608937}"

Throughout my recovery I have relapsed 4 times, the most recent time being January to March 2020. Before that I had been sober for over a year and had gotten engaged to my fianc√©. She has issues with addicts in her life although she herself has never had an addiction. She has always told me she wanted me to tell her right away when I thought I was going to use but for some reason it‚Äôs never been that easy for me. The last time I relapsed she told me if it happened again she would leave me so this last relapse I was reluctant to tell her. I finally mustered up the courage to tell her last night and now she has decided to call off the wedding and it looks like she wants to end our relationship as well. I‚Äôve been working so hard towards my recovery going to therapy, drug counseling, and AA for me, this time I did it for me and not because I was told I had to from her or family. And this time it does feel different all I needed was her support. The issue is I kept it a secret for over a year and have broken her trust. My question is how can I help to mend this wound and show her that I am sincere and I would sacrifice everything just to be with her. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?

In my case, freedom is both a choice and a constant battle. I guess you could say that's true for many instances of freedom, they're earned - but mine has no finish line. I will never cross a threshold and be rid of the poison that travels my veins. 

Addiction never really *goes away*, I will never truly be free. 

But it does get easier as time erodes the obsession and cravings to use. And as that has happened I've been able to take on a new perception of myself, and the life I lead. 

 I fought like hell for this half-assed version of freedom, and I'm finally in a place where I'm in control, and that's a massive victory. It's like I can let my guard down a little bit, but never too much. If and when I have thoughts of using I know how to combat them. I know how to disarm my mind and rationalize the reasons why I shouldn't crush up that line....

Eesh. 

Just writing that makes me miss it. *That's my truth.*

And I'm proud of myself for recognizing that, and moving on. It's been almost a year and 2 weeks of sobriety, and I've learned a great deal about myself and about the process of letting go. There's many cycles, and it isn't easy to see everything for what it is when you're immersed in it - such as many things. But I've come to a point of clarity, likely because it's a significant milestone and I have been doing a lot of reflecting on my (long) time as a user, and my time sober from opiates. 

And I'd like to share some things I've learned when reflecting on my first 6 months of being sober. 

- Simply quitting or abstaining from using my drugs of choice fixed almost nothing, except my bank account. Nothing ""changed"" until I began recovery, started asking for help, and acknowledged that I had a lot of work to do on myself, and that the problem wasn't using, really. The problem was *why* I was using. And the fact is that it was my coping mechanism, my way out of dealing with life, and the only way I knew how to feel happiness. 

- There are a lot of miserable days. Tears. Shame. Guilt. Fear. And in the beginning it was really tough for me to make sense of where any of it was coming from. Everyone kept telling me how great I was doing, how I should be proud, and it made me feel like I was broken because I felt none of that. 

- I also learned life is not unbearable without prescription opiates. Some days it felt like that still, but most were okay

- I started remembering who I was before the drugs gave me a different identity. 

- I began to truly experience my emotions again

- Acknowledging, owning, and ultimately accepting responsibility for my behaviors, choices, actions and words when I was an active user was crucial to moving forward. 

- I transitioned from a completely self-centered state of mind to being aware and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. I am still practicing this, it has been challenging for me to step outside my own perception and hear/see things in the way someone else does. 

- I missed the relationship I had with opiates. Someone here compared the beginning stages of sobriety to losing someone you care for deeply. It felt exactly like that, I would describe myself as feeling incomplete, lost and alone for the first few months. 

- Holidays were really tough for me, along with other things. I began learning what my triggers were and doing what I could to prepare and minimize risk if possible. The decision to be sober takes planning and commitment on level I didn't think I had in me, but I just kept at it one day at a time. 

- Staying sober was my main priority in life during those first 6 months

And in closing, something I've learned more recently is that I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life, and after using for almost my whole adult life (in one capacity or another) I can safely say that that is no coincidence. 

Let freedom ring, bitches ü§ò

Y'all so I was super nervous going the state over to visit my best friend yesterday, its been sooo long since ive been on a trip like that w.o my own vehicle, but omg im so glad I went Cuz we had SUCH a good time!! It was only supposed to be a smaller gathering but like 30 or so people ended up showing up and i actually had so much fun. I haven't been to any kind of party or large social gathering in over 3 years, since well before I got clean and not since I was ""kicked out"" of my city's childish punk scene, so a part of me was a lil trepidatious but once I started talking to ppl (the only ppl I knew there were my best friend and her bf no one else) it was like a switch flipped in my head like damn bitch you still got it! It felt so weird but so good to not give a fuck about scene politics or impressing ppl and also be one of the older ppl at the party, I used to care so much about all that shit and man it's so freeing to just... not.  

I still don't think im gonna end up going to parties or shows regularly, as I enjoy how calm and chill my life is now, but I definitely am gonna start doing some sort of larger social thing at least every couple months or so. My extroverted brain just needs it, and now that I'm older and my priorities are in better order these type of events are way more beneficial vs detrimental (cuz they def used to be the latter).  

Well speaking of being older and more responsible I legit only had 4, maybe 5 drinks over the course of like the 6 hours I was there (I wasn't drinking water in between tbh but I did chug a shitton and eat food too as soon as I got home)  and got a reasonable amount of sleep but I feel like total shit today. Today and tmrw are my manager shifts and I just really hope its slow today.. im sure it will be after the holiday weekend and all (ppl w normal shift jobs, is this weekend a long weekend for y'all?).  

 Omg and one more thing before I get going- I video chatted w my parents yesterday before leaving for my homegirls house, and this morning I wake up to a random text from my mom saying that her and my dad would like to pay for me and G to stay in a much nicer hotel or air bnb on our vacation this August!!! Like fucking what?? My parents never ever do shit like that, esp not out of the blue!!! This is the type of shit legit my whole life I wished they'd do, esp considering their reasons behind doing it (because they're proud of me for my promotion and being self sufficient and working my ass off and I, in their words, deserve a nice vacation... these are all things I NEVER thought I'd hear my parents tell me), I'd always see my friends' parents like looking out for them in ways like this and id hope so much that someday my parents could maybe be that way towards me and I truly can't believe that it actually happened. So now im even more excited for this vacation!! It's so nice to have something to look forward to, I'm going to from now on always take like two 1.5wk long vacations a year because it just .. makes everything better, yk?  

Anyways, I feel like shit because I'm old now and can't drink and party anymore even if it's in a very responsible way üò£üò£üò£ so I gotta get in the damm shower and get this show on the road so I can at least get into work like 30min early. How was everyone's 4th of July? Also real quick is it just me or were there WAY more fireworks than normal this year like wtf was up with that? I hope y'all all had wonderful weekends, even if you spent it sick af feeling like shit its still good in a weird way because you're doing the best thingyou could ever do for yourself.

 I contacted my GP and they have basically told me that I'm on my own with this. They refuse to prescribe anything for me to help me cut down and the local addiction team doesn't have an appointment for another 2 months so I'm having this solo.

Every time I try to taper I get withdrawals coming on pretty fast. Hot flushes up my neck and into my head, RLS and just a burning feeling in my body in general.

I'm in the UK - alot of withdrawal aids aren't available here so I don't know where to start. Is there anything that I can legally take to help curb the WDs and help me with tapering off this stuff?

Between throwing myself into work and school in 2019 and covid in 2020 I've ofc kicked it in small groups of friends but my best homegirl n her bf are having a party (outdoors, but everyone's vaxxed too) at their house for 4th of July so even though it's a 2hr train ride I miss the shit outta her and am excited to actually like be around ppl (well, to be a guest at an ~event~ rather than working one Cuz lord knows I been steady been around large groups of ppl due to my work lol) so I'm getting the show on the road early today so that I can head over to hers.   

Im even excited for the train ride tbh, back in the day I used to like take trips to see friends outta state n shit all the damn time but between getting clean, being in an abusive relationship for 4ish years, and covid, I'm boring af and stay steady in my city w.o leaving for months these days lol.  

Oh I also bought one of those back compressor things yesterday, it ended up helping me a decent amount. My GM had to leave early to help the old GM/now beverage director (ya know we still ain't had a party for all 3 of us getting promoted at once; we gotta do that lol) at our new Mexican restaurant, so even though I was feeling like shit I was manager for the rest of the night... ended up having mad fun though, one of my cooks who im good homies w and been there longer than me stayed late and kicked it w us while closing n since he lives 2 blocks from me my homegirl/coworker ended up giving us both a ride back west which was mad nice of her. Dicking around and having fun def helped distract me from the pain a bit, I'm really grateful to work somewhere where for the first time in my life I refer to my coworkers as friends before coworkers lol.  

Anyways back to the back compressor thing im a lil embarrassed to wear it visibly which ik is stupid but I'm tryna look at it as an old punk bitch ~badge of honor~ like, you live the kinda life I did for 10+ yrs and you'll end up w chronic pain/ injuries too sooooo don't do it Cuz it sucks, dumb I know but any of y'all involved in the punk scene at any point will kinda know what I mean. I gotta stfu n get going Cuz I'm supposed to video chat w my parents in like an hour and I gotta ask them bout meeting Gs parents in August since we're all gonna be in our home city at the same time.  

How is everyone else feeling today? Anyone got fun plans? If not who gives a shit honestly, don't let yourself get fomo-y around holidays esp if you're still only a few weeks in and feeling under the weather - just do whatever feels right for you. Its pretty damn nice out today at least in the NE so if anything maybe go on a lil walk or drive out to a nature preserve or some shit- or fuck it, go shopping and buy yourself nice frivolous things you couldn't afford while still using ; it's a Sunday and a holiday man treat yo self!!

I only have 2-3 days of opi's left, and it's time to get my fucking life together. Im fucking done waking up sick every day.

I have like 40 pills of 300mg lyrica, and like 200+ pills of 10mg diazepam. Im not dependant on either and Im not really worried about that, I dont even like benzos, I just want to use them for the acutes. I also have benadryl, shit load of vitamin C, vitamin b complex, and some amino acids like glycine, and l-phenylanine. I wish I had weed but I kicked that a month ago and if I start it again it'll be so hard mentally to quit again. Opiates and weed are my demons.

I know this doesnt sound good, but I was kind of hoping/wondering if I could just take a ton of the lyrica+diazepam and just be completely zoinked through the worst of the withdrawals.

Is this a bad idea? I just feel like I won't be able to do it otherwise, but I'm not trying to, like, overdose.

I have a mild-moderate tolerance to lyrica, taking 300mg I feel it somewhat but I've done like 1000mg before. I have a low tolerance to diazepam but it's there, like 5mg for instance does nothing for me, but 10-20 is where I start to feel it, but I've taken 30-40mg before.

I know with opi w/d's benzos tend to need a higher dose than usual to help, is there a dose you guys would recommend starting with/not exceeding? Same question goes for lyrica. I know they probably potentiate one another as well.

Has anyone here tried to do something along the same lines as this for quitting? I know it won't be painless, but CT i think is the only chance for me

Thank you guys so much

I took every non-comfort med suggestion seriously, and utilized each one. I re-read positive notions almost obsessively. I felt connections to dozens of faceless individuals and friends spanning the planet. One of the most influential aspects of the experience was feeling less special, knowing that there were/are so many others writhing, wretching, crawling, tossing, turning, waking, sitting, standing, eating, smiling, recovering- right at the same moment as I. Powerful stuff, life saving moments, genuine, selfless, no-strings-attached love. When I read posts from those of us who are embarking on the battle of their lives, I often get a positive charge just knowing that they will feel the same comfort that I did from the beautifully spun, colorful and rich tapestry created by the whole of the members here who choose to service others, as they serve themselves.

I remember how I felt like a huge chop waiting for my dealer to arrive, brought back some serious deja-vu. my mom 100% had her suspicions (she has eyes like a hawk + she went through a similar narrative with my father in the past) and yea that was a terrible feeling, I wanted to tell her that I did have a slight relapse (2 weeks ago now at this point) but I feel like that might do more harm than good. I still havn't told anybody about it, and usually I would atleast tell one of my friends. 

the weirdest thing is, I wasn't like my normal self when I would smoke fent, I was OVERLY ecstatic and was full of energy, few of my co-workers even complimented me on my attitude saying im more chipper than I have been the last couple of months. But I know that the more I use, the worse the effects are going to become. my buddy hit me up 2-3 days ago and told me he has some fire right now, But I told him im good, that I don't wanna fall down the hole too far. 

I'm not too sure how to feel about the whole situation, I feel like I tarnished the 11 months of sobriety that I had accumulated, not sure if I set myself back far from that little stint.

We both have jobs that are making us a pretty solid income. We have friends, a network, we go to meetings. We have vacations planned, and he's saving to buy himself a sports car.

I went to the ER and they did a CT showing thickening of the small bowel loops right where the pain was, inflammed lymph nodes, and a misty mesentery. Bloodwork was normal. Followed up with GI specialist who has no idea what is going on. They did a small bowel follow through that showed some constipation so they put me on linzess. It's pretty much every day, and it cycles from the front to my back (in that same spot). When I lay down for sleep it goes away until I get back upright the next day. I'm also very gassy, and when this originally showed up my hunger increased like 500% suddenly, which I'd never felt anything like before. I'd eat and feel worse, and then as the food digested I'd be super super hungry again, like I had not eaten in days.

It marks 6 months since I‚Äôve taken any codeine or morphine. I would have like to have written it in more detail but maybe that‚Äôs a book for the future. 
The point was to make sure that all my friends, family and acquaintances all knew the same story about what I‚Äôve been through. 
It was a huge step for me as I‚Äôve never been public with details of my addiction and how it‚Äôs shaped my life. 
üîØüåà

Addiction. 
Addiction‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a tough one isn‚Äôt it. It takes on so many forms. Drugs. Alcohol. Smoking. Shopping. Food. Gambling. And the list goes on. The point is we often don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs an addiction until it‚Äôs too late. Until we are in too deep. We can‚Äôt manage without it‚Ä¶..
We use it as a crutch, physically and mentally. Wether it‚Äôs doing something to celebrate (day having a drink to reward) or doing something to console ourselves (having a drink to commiserate). The point is both make us feel better. It‚Äôs when you start doing something constantly or finding any little reason to do it that it becomes a problem. Justifying a need to have a drink or whatever it is that is starting to take over your life. 
You see, when I was prescribed codeine 18 years ago for back pain after having my first child at no point did I think that nearly 20 years later I would be sat here writing this. 
I found it a miracle drug. Not only did it take my pain away but it made me feel like superwoman. As a single Mum with a newborn and working a full time job I was capable of fulfilling the endless list of things that needed to be done. So I kept taking it. There wasn‚Äôt a negative reason to be taking it. I took it because it made me feel good and helped me achieve. 
But after a couple of years the realisation hits. I actually can‚Äôt get up in the morning without it. I can‚Äôt function without it. So I kept taking it. 
I‚Äôve had several goes at trying to stop. I did a couple of times but mentally and emotionally I just kept going back to it because despite the negative impact I loved the way it made me feel. That‚Äôs the trouble with the things we are addicted to. They make us feel good. We crave that feeling every time we do whatever it is that gives us that buzz. 
The trouble is though with a lot of things especially opiates is that we build a tolerance. So it just takes more and more to get that buzz we crave. 
I used it as my crutch. Physically, mentally and emotionally. I‚Äôve used it through good times, bad times and too many other times to mention. It would be the first thing I think about, take when I wake and the last thing I think about at the the end of the day. 
I didn‚Äôt realise it until it was far too late but I became someone else. There was two of me. The addicted me became the forefront. But you see for the most part only I knew about it. 
I tried to get the real me back many times but I was in too deep. I can‚Äôt really explain that person that I had become but I struggle to explain that. 
I can tell you that I had become an awful person. Day to day I maintained and fulfilled my roles as a Mum, wife, daughter, granddaughter, whoever I needed to be at whatever day, date or time but underneath that addiction ruled me. 
I had done so many things over the years that lost me family, friends trust and love. I don‚Äôt blame anyone but myself. I had got me to that point and I really couldn‚Äôt see a way out. Everything I did was to survive on an addicted level. If I didn‚Äôt have the codeine I couldn‚Äôt function. The physical pain through not having it was like death. Well that‚Äôs how it felt to me. 
10 years ago I started to experience stomach pain. I was later diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs disease. I went through a bowel rupture which nearly cost me my life (that‚Äôs the short story). 
Opiates then became a necessity as I needed to take them to stop the pain. It was a good thing to me as I didn‚Äôt have to hide it. I had a reason to take it. Over the last 8 years I have been through a bowel rupture, been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, reoccurring pancreatitis, gallstones, 4 miscarriages, a blood clotting disorder that I am now on lifelong medication for. I have been hospitalised more times than I can actually remember now. At least 50 I‚Äôm guessing. 
So by this point I‚Äôm shot to bits. Physically I‚Äôm a mess, in daily pain that I can‚Äôt manage. Mentally my head is not even thinking rationally anymore and I just didn‚Äôt know what to do or where to turn. 
Last year everything came out into the open. More so than it had been. People close to me knew of my addiction but it‚Äôs shameful isn‚Äôt it. That‚Äôs why we justify to ourselves why we are doing something. Making a wrong into a right in our minds. 
Shame. What a word. It‚Äôs what my therapist describes as sticky. SHAME STICKS. We find it hard to talk about our habit because we are ashamed of it. I‚Äôm ashamed as a grown woman married with three beautiful children that I had let my life fall apart. Afraid of the unknown. Scared. ASHAMED most of all. I‚Äôd try to talk about it. I did sometimes. Just not enough. I wanted to get help but I couldn‚Äôt imagine how I would be without opiates. How I would manage. Especially as I had all these things medically wrong with me and I felt that the opiates were holding me together. 
I think one of the main reasons I didn‚Äôt talk about it more was because I was scared of people talking about me. Back to the SHAME again. I was scared of talking to people who cared about me and then them talking about me to others behind my back. 
My doctor up until last year was my confidant. I talked to him about everything. He supported me and helped to try and manage my intake as best he could. I was still buying extra on top of what he was prescribing weekly as I had built such a tolerance to it. I was also prescribed stronger opiates because of the medical things I had going on. It‚Äôs never enough though is it. Whatever our addiction is we can‚Äôt just have one and stop and it grows from there didn‚Äôt it. 
After last year hit. The shame was at its highest. My addiction was at its worst and I couldn‚Äôt take it any longer. I‚Äôm a grown woman for gods sake. I need to take back control of my life. Part of me wanted just to end it so I didn‚Äôt have to face anything or anyone. I came close. Last year‚Ä¶. Lockdown‚Ä¶.. loosing our house (because of me) ‚Ä¶. and the worst part was loosing my Dad. I can‚Äôt write anymore about him. It still hurts too much. I miss him too much. I want to apologise (the one person I can‚Äôt apologise to) for being such a crap daughter. I could have done more, I could have fought harder and been better. I‚Äôm sorry. 
It‚Äôs the realisation after so many years that I have hurt so many people. Lost so many friends and family. That was the addicted me. I can‚Äôt change what I‚Äôve done and for that I will always carry that shame and I do wholeheartedly apologise. I never meant to hurt anyone and that is the problem with addiction. It doesn‚Äôt just affect the addict. It affects everyone around you. 
I can‚Äôt change the past but I can change and shape the future. 
TODAY‚Ä¶. Today marks 6 months. 6 whole months to the day since I have taken codeine or morphine. 
My new doctors referred me to Turning Point. I saw them in December last year for a consultation and was accepted. I have been on a medical programme with them and I can honestly say if had known it would be like this then I would have done it sooner. They have changed my life. 
I have spent the last six months under the care of my GP who calls me every week without fail for medical support and sometimes nothing more than a chat. 
I speak weekly/two weekly to Jason at Turning Point. He supports me in any way he can with advice and other help. 
Claire my therapist who I have a weekly session with to undo/make better the emotional side of things. 
Paula my Crohn‚Äôs nurse who is on the phone 24/7. 
My wonderful husband who has acknowledged the changes made and despite a rocky year so far for us relationship wise is happy to work on us together and as a family. 
My best friend Sophie and my sister Kate because every girl needs support like these two. 
My kids for being so fantastic and are loving their new Mummy. 
Three months ago I was able to come off my Crohn‚Äôs treatment. I have gone into remission which is something I never thought would happen. It appears not taking opiates has made that all better. I‚Äôve not been to hospital once this year which is a real testament. 
For me the biggest change is how much clearer I feel in my mind. I can see and think about everything so much more rationally. I can cope better with any situations that arise. 
I‚Äôve been able to declare myself self-employed and I‚Äôve just ordered all my stock to start my own online business. 
Not having to constantly worry about if I have enough medication, if I need to buy more, if it‚Äôs going to turn up before I run out is a huge relief. I don‚Äôt have that anxiety anymore. It really is an amazing feeling. 
I can‚Äôt change what has happened in the past. I can deal with the issues I have relating to the past with my therapist. I acknowledge that I have been through a lot over the last couple of decades and that I made the wrong choices and took the wrong path. 
I am forever grateful for the people that have stood by me and helped me through the last six months. I have no intention of ever stepping back into what was. 
By writing this it is helping me to deal with some of the shame I have been carrying for a long time. I could have written so much more, in more detail (Adi said I should write a book) but I hope this is enough of an insight into what I have been through. 
I wanted to have it all out in the open. Hopefully it means people will be able to talk to me about it. I wanted to not silence the talk behind backs because that will always happen, but I hope that this answers some questions. 
I hope that even if this helps one person to acknowledge their problems, to get help or change a path, to make someone more able to talk openly to others who maybe struggling then it has done some good. 
I have already started helping others. I am helping another lady who is struggling with codeine addiction and I am also part of an online support group helping others with opiate addiction. 
Some people just genetically have a brain that is more easily affected by addiction. One person could take codeine for a couple of months and stop just like that. Others are almost immediately affected and addicted. 
Codeine is a string drug. It is effectively a lesser form of heroin. The withdrawal symptoms are the same as coming off heroin. There are thousands and thousands of people who are addicted to it. Who buy it over the counter everyday. Who change their whole day to go to different chemists to buy it so it doesn‚Äôt flag up that they are buying it regularly. It‚Äôs one hell of a drug. 
There are so many people addicted to so many different things. Not just opiates. Being there for people to help in any way you can and not passing judgement is the biggest form of help. 
I‚Äôm not asking for reply‚Äôs to this. I just wanted you all to have some understanding as to what I have been through and why and to make you think. 
Love to you all. Xxxx",2,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50055134}"
