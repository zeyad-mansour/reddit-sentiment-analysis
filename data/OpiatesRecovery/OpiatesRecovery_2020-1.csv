DID YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE WAS WARNED ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC?," In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the domestic cultivation of *P. bracteatum* was proposed by President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon)'s [Office of Management and Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget) in the early 1970s as an alternative to [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) [opium poppies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_somniferum), which the administration was attempting to eliminate. This was because *P. bracteatum* does not contain [morphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine), which is converted to [heroin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin) but is high in [thebaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebaine) for legal codeine production, which was in crisis at the time because of the dwindling Turkish supply. However, US government scientists feared [Bentley compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_compounds), [opioids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid) thousands of times more potent than heroin, would replace heroin in the US.

The subs are nasty as hell but I'm still choosing to buy those over the oxy or Dilaudid I'm also bringing offered. The real challenge comes Monday when our friend gets his script of opana and texts us to ask us if we want it 
I've gone to 2 NA meetings, going to my third tonight. Mostly because my friends are pushing me to go to NA. They want me to go every day for 90 days. Do y'all really think that's necessary? And is it really necessary to not use anything? I like to smoke and am also prescribed Xanax for anxiety attack. I also like a drink VERY occasionally. It bothers me that I'm expected by my friends who are also substance abusers to not partake in any of these things any more. 

Also- I was/am actually prescribed pain killers for back/neck pain- I have a couple herniated discs and they wanted to do a disc replacement but I'm only 29 so when I got a second opinion I was told I should wait. What do I do for when my pain gets really bad if I can't take pain pills?

Texas is usually at the bottom of lists measuring the scale of the crisis by states, in part because they only take into account OD deaths.

Need Advice and Support,"So to make a long story short I have always used drugs recreationally on and off ever since I was 15. I‚Äôd go through different phases. Finally and most recently I tried heroin and boy what a mistake that was. Now I desire to quit recreational drug use for good. 

I tried heroin for the first time September 2019. For the first couple months I‚Äôd only smoke it maybe twice a day, and I was fine for the most part. I‚Äôd get very mild withdrawal symptoms after about 3 days of no use. Then near the end of November 2019, I started smoking everyday. Within a few weeks, I realized I started getting withdrawal symptoms within about 12hrs I‚Äôd my last use. Ever since then I had the luxury to always have heroin available, and to smoke more and more up until now because I had a savings before my habit started. So I have never had to go longer than 12hrs without using for the last 2 months. 

However I decided to quit when I realized this drug was starting to change me physically, my mood, and take over my life and finances. I‚Äôve done a lot of research, reading forums, and heard from other users how terrible withdrawal cold turkey is. I considered suboxone but decided I would try cold turkey first. I visited and spoke with an addiction specialist doctor 2 days ago and it gave me a lot of hope I can do this, but now as the time of reckoning is near I‚Äôm getting super anxious. 

The doctor gave me a script of 30 .1mg clonidine to help with the withdrawal symptoms. Plus suboxone in case I can‚Äôt go through with the cold turkey. Any extra tips and support to get through this next week or so would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôve never felt withdrawal symptoms past 12hrs so I‚Äôm very scared and anxious honestly, but I really want to get through this. 
Thank you.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4644537}"
2020-01-30 17:28:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ewdm18/gabapentin_clonidine_really_work/,Gabapentin + clonidine really work!,"First, let me just say thanks for this sub and anyone who has posted/commented. I‚Äôve been a long time lurker and the info here has been invaluable to me personally. I‚Äôm posting this in the hopes it helps someone else out. 

Some background for context. Been prescribed opiates (hydro, oxy and fent patches) 150-180mgs per day for more than 4 years due to spinal issues. I always took them as prescribed and never more/less, always passed my urine tests, etc. They helped the pain, but messed with me mentally and I always wanted off. Was buying time until the right type of surgery could be FDA approved in the US. That finally happened in July 2019 and I had 3 spine surgeries over the course of 6 months. Before the surgeries I had tried to stop 3 separate times because the drugs were changing my personality. Tried both the taper method and cold turkey. Got a month off the meds CT before the pain was too much and went back on again. Ill never forget the detox as it was brutal. I didn‚Äôt know anything about comfort meds at the time or really even withdrawal and all I had was valerian root and some other supplements. I still have bad dreams about that experience. 

When I went back on the meds I also added Kratom, specifically OPMS liquid shots (potent extract) on top of all my pain meds. So I became cross dependent. I tried removing the kratom out of my regiment but noticed I got really sick when I stopped, even while taking large doses of prescription meds. Kratom hits the opiate receptors but it also has alkaloids that hit other areas of the brain that come with it‚Äôs own seperate withdrawal symptoms all together. More power to the folks who use kratom to come off traditional opiates as it‚Äôs definitely safer due to the lack of a respiratory depression function, but for me, this was just another opioid i wanted free from.

Flash forward to now. Pain free from the surgeries so the surgeons and pain management docs say it‚Äôs time to come off the meds. They put together a 6-8 week tapering plan and prescribed clonidine, Gabapentin and Valium for the withdrawal symptoms. I was ready for this but also really scared based on my previous experience. So I started the taper and although slow, I was clouded and I couldn‚Äôt focus on work or family so I decided to go cold turkey 7 days ago. 

The difference between the last detox and this time...gabapentin and clonidine. 

I took 1800mg of gabapentin though-out the day in 300-600mg doses, clonidine twice per day and the 10mg Valium at night. I‚Äôm shocked at how much these masked the withdrawals. I‚Äôd say easily 75% and kept my mood positive and my body comfortable. Now, dont expect to go to work or continue on with your daily life, you will be bed ridden for the first few days, but you wont want to die. In fact, you might even relax and enjoy catching up on some reading or Netflix. I didn‚Äôt sleep much (6 hours in 4 days) but I didn‚Äôt care. Time flew by fast where as before each minute felt like a day. I was pushing through the lack of sleep with ease. I still had the creepy crawling feelings in my limbs, but seemed much less than the last time. I even went back to work yesterday. 

I stopped taking the gaba, clonidine and Valium after day 5 and have had no effects from stopping those so far.

I‚Äôm fatigued and still have sleep issues and I‚Äôm aware its only been a week and it will take my brain a few months to ‚Äúrewire‚Äù from 4 years of depending on a substance. But for the first time in a long time, i feel like me again. Pain free and drug free!

From what my dr. said, these are very commonly prescribed  meds for opiate withdrawal. Everyone‚Äôs chemistry is unique, but i see a lot of other validation on here from other folks so please consider adding these to your withdrawal defense armory.

Don‚Äôt fear the withdrawal whatever your method. It‚Äôs often worse in anticipation.

Either someone is dating at addict, an addict is dating someone who doesn‚Äôt use, or someone who‚Äôs in recovery that‚Äôs wondering when it‚Äôd be a good idea to ‚Äúget back out there‚Äù in the dating game. Well, here I am at 131 days and I reallyyyy struggled with this even still. 

This guy I was seeing for about 2 months and every other day of the week (so a significant amount of time together altogether). We had our first and only minor disagreement in our relationship on Monday night. I won‚Äôt go into what the issue was specifically, but lemme just tell you - it was dumb as shit and really shouldn‚Äôt have made it a breaking point in our relationship. Not on my end anyway! His however, I guess it was. The next day (yesterday around this time) it‚Äôs like he stewed about the whole thing overnight and was even angrier. He texted me pretty much ‚Äúgood luck and goodbye‚Äù. I was floored. I mean, I sort of had a feeling - call it women‚Äôs intuition I guess - that I cared about him a lot more than he was into me, but I was so flabbergasted that he was willing to just completely cut ties like it was nothing and I didn‚Äôt mean shit to him. Guess he didn‚Äôt! Not to mention with no further explanation about why what happened pushed him this far (believe me, I asked and didn‚Äôt even get the decency of a reply). 

 Anyway, here I am with a significant amount of sobriety under my belt and I had never been so close to relapsing ever. I even drove almost all the way to my dealers house after work with money in hand. I just wanted to say ‚Äúfuck it all then! I‚Äôm sick of being so easily disposable to everyone I open up to. Wtf does it matter if I‚Äôm fucked up! Nobody even cares!‚Äù I was distraught. Luckily, I turned around before I got to his house (I had a lot of time to think and cry in rush hour traffic lol) because I knew that wouldn‚Äôt help me in the long run, only for the moment. 

My whole point in writing this though is to warn those in recovery to take things SLOWWWW. I seriously don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll even consider dating again until I‚Äôm at 6 months or more. Not until I‚Äôve found a better outlet for stressful situations like these anyway. Personally, dating issues are one of my biggest triggers. I can‚Äôt handle the bad times or rejection because that shit breaks my heart. I know recovery gets lonely sometimes, but this time is about YOU. Get yourself back on track first and make your main goals about you, your life, and your accomplishments. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm doing somewhat better now. Sad, yes, but if y‚Äôall knew the whole story of the situation, y‚Äôall would agree that he‚Äôs a fucking asshole and didn‚Äôt really care about me in the first place. I don‚Äôt want someone like that anyway. This time is for ME.",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6140455}"

My stepmom has been caring for him and has been firing the home health aids my brother and sister have been paying for. Her health is failing, too. She has senile dementia. 

What a clusterfuck. 

So, here I am on day three after a three day binge. Before that, I had four days. That last binge was god awful. Grief and being high isn‚Äôt a good thing for me. Oh the fucked up places my mind went.....collapsing on the kitchen floor sobbing while high was awful. I‚Äôd rather feel it all sober and process the pain out of my system than have to go through that again. And of course the detox, however mild and short it was, sucked way worse than before.

During that short binge, I failed at being there for my family. We are all trying to pull together to make my fathers last moments here peaceful while being present with the hopes that he won‚Äôt forget who we are. It‚Äôs not working. He still forgets, but at least we are there.

Right now, I have zero cravings and withdrawal was minimal.

I'm 7 days clean this morning, the worst of the acute wd's are over, still a lot of agitation and way more feelings than I'm comfortable with. But this time around I've barely felt the want to use over this last week. Until this morning. 

I know it's just PAWS kicking in, I know I could just once without resetting the acute withdrawal process, I could feel fine again, silence the nagging in the back of my head and my aching joints.

This is my new rock bottom.,"After having over 2 years clean, I‚Äôve found myself behaving the same way I was in the worst of my addiction years ago. 

Long story short - I stole my girlfriend‚Äôs entire oxy script she got for surgery, before she even got discharged from the hospital. I rationalized it every possible way I could, but in the end I regretted it the second i popped all 15 of those little pure 5‚Äôs. It barely got me high but it was ‚Äúone more‚Äù, ‚Äúthe last time‚Äù, etc.  I waited until we got back home and she was a little more oriented to come clean. It was hard to do and I considered lying and saying that I lost them or I flushed them cuz I couldn‚Äôt take the temptation. But something was different this time. I felt like I needed to start making the right decisions if I ever want to stay clean, starting with telling the truth. 

I love this girl to death but this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve gone behind her back with it. I can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs still with me after how much I‚Äôve lied, because she doesn‚Äôt deserve it. I feel like I want to get clean for her more than I do for myself. I guess that‚Äôll have to be my motivation until I find enough will to do it for me. Hopefully I find that soon.

I'll try to make this quick and to the point. Over the past couple months I've been abusing heroin. Somehow I got caught up in an euphoric haze. My use began first only at nights. A couple weeks later a couple bumps in the day were necessary to feel alright, with more liberal use at night to the point of nodding out. This pattern continued for another 6 weeks or so, with ever increasing usage particulary in the day to keep away gooseflesh and other symptoms of opiate withdrawal.

I ran out about a week ago. For about 36 hours, I went without hardly opiates and felt absolutely terrible. I only managed to scrape a few pitiful bumps out of the bags I accumulated. I re upped and conscious of how badly I felt during those 36 hours, I cut back my usage significantly. I now am doing probably 50% of when I was using liberally.

Here's the thing. I picked up 10 lortabs and two more points of heroin. I am taking a small bump every 4 hours or so - whenever the nasty sickness becomes evident. I'm stretching these two points out over the next 72 hopefully. From there, I plan to use the lortabs in a similar fashion.

The whole idea is to taper. I had no luck using the search bar to find a strategy on how effective tapering is. Right now, these bumps produce zero euphoria. I don't feel them, I just don't feel sick.

I realize that I could be dead next, from overdose or health problems. Its also become such an expensive habit to have. Its gotten to the point where I am going every day or every other day and spending $200-300 to support both my boyfriends addiction as well as my own. He doesn't work and I work PT, the only reason I've been able to do this so far is because I got a settlement from a car accident and he had money saved from when he WAS working as a drug dealer. On top of this we still have our regular bills, which are also not cheap. My bank account has quickly been drained and I am at the point where I feel helpless because I REALLY would like to quit taking drugs, but I am afraid to go through withdrawals and my addiction seems to be stronger than my will. I get a prescription from a doctor but have problems every month getting them filled so often times find myself having to buy off the street. It used to be that I could just take 1 30 mg oxy a day but its now gotten to the point where I am taking 150mg +. I feel like all I do is do drugs, sleep, and spend time acquiring drugs when I am not working. Its tiring and leaves me feeling terrible about myself. When I don't take the drugs, however, I am in so much pain because I have herniated discs in my neck and I have back issues from the accident I previously mentioned. 

I want to do something with my life. I want to be interested in things again, I want to have goals again. I want to travel without worrying about running out of drugs on my trip. I want to be happy again. I have considered suicide more often than I would like to admit, though I haven't ever really followed through with it as I cant imagine putting my family and friends through that. But I am just so helpless feeling and I want my life back. I am severely depressed and don't really have anything that I enjoy any more. I don't see friends like I used to. I don't really go out and do things. The fact that I am always bored doesn't help the drug use, as I use BECAUSE of boredom, but I have no energy to do things because I do drugs. 

I have thought about going to rehab but I don't want people to know that I have an addiction issue. I work in the social security department and I know that they can see your record as far as if you've done drugs or went to rehab. I also don't want people to judge me if they find out I went to rehab bc that obv means I was an addict. Even if I didn't care about peoples judgement I don't have the time to take off work to go to rehab. But I don't have the money to continue using the way I am now.

With everything that just happened, I feel I need to be on it right now, I've figured. So I put everything in motion and I got a call from specialty pharmacy Orsini saying: my copay for the Vivitrol shot is $600/month. That's WITH the maximum $500/month copay assistance the company will give me. This is what it will cost me per month until I meet my deductible. 

I told Orsini that I just got out of the psych hospital and I have a big bill coming, so that will likely knock out a good chunk of, if not the entirety of my deductible for the year. That can take up to 30 days for the insurance company to process though. So they're going to resubmit their request for coverage again in *three weeks*.

You know, I'm pissed. I don't want to wait, but there's no way in hell I'm paying that much, that's literally financially insane. I do have at least a month's supply of 50mg naltrexone pills, so I'm going to start taking those. The problem is remembering, but I can do it for a month.

Last year, the shot was covered. I paid a copay to the clinic every month, I think $50. Near the end of the year the clinic tried to tell me I owed them almost a thousand dollars. They said that my insurance decided (in September, mind you) that the clinic was out-of-network and they weren't going to pay for the medical office visit portion, so here's nine months of fees you owe us now. I fought with them, told them I wouldn't pay it because it shouldn't take someone nine months to figure that out and I couldn't afford to anyway. I think they went back and told my insurance this, because somehow my bill was adjusted to a more affordable $580 and I did end up paying that later. But I stopped getting the shot because the copay got a lot higher from that point on and I couldn't afford it at the time. And of course I got overwhelmed and stopped talking to my support network and relapsed.

Anyway my question is its day 5 and I feel pretty much normal. Would I now be through the worst of the withdrawals so I could remove the patch. Iv used them purely to get off the tramadol or would that then fetch on more withdrawals. I dont want to be on the patches so dont want my body getting use to them or it's back to square one again. Would I have any withdrawal from the patch after only 5 days do you think. Thank you



Iv been taking 50mg x 8 a day of zydol I believe the instant release tramadol for 7 year. Religiously every day. Had enough of the bloody stuff so decided to get off it. 

Doctor prescribed me buprenorphine patches and sent me away with not much other advice.

I have never previously got past the 12 hr mark without having to take a pill. I have 4 kids and dont have the option to distance myself or go to bed. I function fine on the tramadol but my god when I dont take them I'm Ill.

So fast forward to 3 days well 71 hours after my last dose. No tapering i just stuck the patch on and away i went.

Got up the following morning expecting the hungover from hell feeling that usually occurs when i dont set my alarm for 6 and pop 2 pills.

Felt ok! Erm ok then what's going on? Iv felt chilly and off it a bit. Can feel the brain zaps ever so slightly but no where near as intense as I do with only 12 hour no pills.

I'm praying to God iv nearly done it with the help of this patch. Head is so much clearer. Kept waiting for the big whammy of wd but still hasnt happened. And it does without the patch iv tried so many times.

Im determined the patch will be off by the end of next week before I get stuck on these bloody things too.

Highly recommend the patch for this reason but obviously only short term

It's a bit like using a sledgehammer to squash an ant I agree but unless you've done tramadol withdrawals it's impossible to understand.

Yes of corse there are worse out there heroin, oxycontin etc. I'm in the uk and 7 year ago tramadol were handed out like smarties by the docs.

I take my hat off to anyone that gets off anything they are addicted to. This is just what has worked for me with 4 kids, after school activities and all the other day to day being a mum involves.

Wondering if you can help me think this through as I am feeling like I'm too weak, or not worthy or claiming sobriety.","So essentially, I'm in detox at the moment. I've wanted to address my addiction for a long time now, but haven't been willing to. I abused prescription opiates, oxycontin was my DOC but any opiate pill or liquid morphine, for around 2 and a half to 3 years. My abuse wavered in usage... for example I might have gone 2-3 months without using in the early days, then maybe once a month, then maybe a few times a month, and then it really became dependant on when I had enough money or the oppurtunity to score. Toward the end, I had a really high tolerance and was using oxy every other day, but even still sometimes would have a week's gap in between. Anyway, long story short I finally committed to detox, and began on Monday. My treating psychiatrist decided it was best to begin opiate replacement therapy, as I was withdrawing quite badly and as I said, had abused for a long time, with a very high tolerance. I am currently on Suboxone, and the plan is to continue this replacement for 6 months (as per my psychiatrist. My issue is... I feel proud, but then again, I feel like I haven't kicked the habit. It's opiate replacement therapy, so I guess I'm still ... using? I mean I have no cravings, and due to the destruction my abuse caused my family, I truly do have the utmost intention to stay away from the pills. In saying that, the Suboxone literally renders Opiates as useless, as it is an opiate-antagonist I believe. That, and it can be incredibly dangerous. Wondering if I can get some of your perspectives. I've read a lot of your posts, and find them incredibly uplifting and amazing to hear - you all should be so proud for the commitments you've made. I guess I'm kind of not in the same class.

I‚Äôve been using heroin for about a decade and I had just over six months clean. Throughout the past six months, I‚Äôve been trying to make things better for myself, actually putting in the effort and making serious changes in my life. I‚Äôve been going to meetings and I have a sponsor. But I learned not long after starting to work with my sponsor that we aren‚Äôt compatible. There‚Äôs no one I can really talk to about things that are affecting my recovery, especially not my sponsor. I feel more like a therapist to her than I am a sponsee. So I bottle a lot of shit up, put on a smile, and push through my depression as best as I can. Not a great game plan, but I don‚Äôt know what else I can do at this point. I‚Äôm not looking for my sponsor to be my therapist, but it‚Äôd be nice to not have someone else‚Äôs problems constantly dumped on me while I‚Äôm struggling to stay afloat.

Anyway, I decided to go on the vivitrol shot a little over six months ago. I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt go on it for me. I went on it for my family and my significant other, hoping that I would eventually find the will to stay clean for myself. Well, that hasn‚Äôt happened yet and my shot was recently delayed by five days. My mind started going places it shouldn‚Äôt and long story short, I met up with my dealer and bought myself a bundle (aka a gram of east coast powder). I sat in the car for a good two hours, going back and forth with myself trying to talk myself out of even trying to get high. I was pretty sure I wouldn‚Äôt be able to because it was only day 27. Eventually I caved and I ended up just snorting half a bag since I didn‚Äôt want to get caught with fresh track marks. Surprise! It worked. And I fucking hate myself for pissing six months away. So I did it again the next day. And the next day. And two times the day after that. I went in to get my shot yesterday, not really giving a shit if it would make me sick or not. Physically I feel fine, but emotionally this shit is eating away at me. Despite feeling like the biggest piece of shit in the world, I‚Äôm so tempted to see if it‚Äôll work tonight. Logically I know I won‚Äôt be able to break through, but I‚Äôll probably try anyway. I‚Äôm shocked it worked on day 27 because my metabolism is shit and I don‚Äôt exercise.

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm posting this. Maybe I can be used as a cautionary tale. Ask me if it was worth it. Actually, I‚Äôll save you the trouble. No, it wasn‚Äôt fucking worth it. I‚Äôm ready to throw myself off a building. I wish I could take it back, but I can‚Äôt. Now the obsessive thoughts are back full force, just after they had finally faded into the background a bit.

Please help,"I have a history of opioid use, to the point where just taking one dose would put me into withdrawal. And it never recovered. Super sensitive opioid system I guess. I took them because it helped with some type of underling fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome disease i have. I laid off them for the past couple years. Had one injection of fentanyl last year though because of surgery, still went into withdrawal.   


This year I tried LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone) which is supposed to help fibro by decreasing brain inflammation due to its TLR4 antagonism. Since its low dose (4.5mg as opposed to the 50mg used for opiate overdose or alcohol withdrawal), it only transiently blocks opioid receptors and causes the body to start producing more endogenous endorphins. It has no withdrawal. Except for me it did. I even started super low at what is called an Ultra Low Dose (0.01mg) for only 12 days. This dose is actually used for people on opioids to prevent tolerance. I worked up to 0.06mg.   


Two days later I woke up in opioid withdrawal, which i am very familiar with from the past. Here I am 8 days in and have no improved. I worry my opioid system was super fragile and I just gave it the final nail in the coffin. I dont know how much longer I can take this.

I hesitate to take anything like DXM or benzodiazipines because they have some mild effect on the opioid receptors and since my opioid system seems to be so hyper sensitive, I dont want to mess with that. The doctor gave me clonidine, but I already have low-normal blood pressure so Im not sure that will help at all.

I had track marks all over my forearms, spending money I legit didn‚Äôt have (overdraft), taking my moms car saying I was going to meetings but instead going to the city to buy coke, etc. and all I was doing was shooting coke, jerking off, and being a fucking loser by myself at 3am.

It's constantly there, having a lot of self doubt, I can barely eat, getting really distracted at work and I just can't have this.  The last time it was this bad was after a bad breakup that just left me feeling terrible about myself.  I've been using Kratom daily in between using the past 3 years or so, and it really helped with my anxiety.  Like it was miraculous, and I really wanted to use it to quit opiates, but like a dick i've just been using it to deal with WDs and be functional at work, and in life in general.  I've had it feel like the Kratom stopped working many times over the years, but by that point I would usually get some h and then since I wouldn't be taking Kratom, I guess it was kind of a tolerance break, but right now it barely feels like it's doing anything. 

I don't know if it's normal for the anxiety to be getting worse after 1 week clean?  It's probably the girl problems that I'm currently having compounded with being clean.  I've begun to notice that I base a lot of my self worth on the girl that I'm with and how she feels about me.

I was in addiction the first half of the year pretty much and started going to NA meetings in November. I know there is a rule of no dating the first year of recovery which is called the ‚Äú13th step‚Äù but I have found myself in a relationship with another NA member I met a month and a half ago. But I have been waiting on the intimacy. Now I‚Äôm kind of wishing we didn‚Äôt agree to be exclusive so soon because I‚Äôm not sure if he can tolerate waiting for intimacy as he sees it as a sign that I am not ‚Äúattracted to him‚Äù when I have voiced the real reason is because I have had a physical and sexual assault years back and intimacy is something I value a lot now that I am older. He is younger and 25 while I am 27 turning 28 this year. He is also about 2 months sober and going to be graduating from his recovery house in a month. I am about 22 days clean now so still relatively new.

Basically, it was very in the moment when he asked me to be his girlfriend last week and I did say yes. But I don‚Äôt think he envisioned waiting a few weeks or even a month (I have no idea when I‚Äôll be ready intimately tbh but 1-2 months is a good ballpark for me). Since all my previous relationships intimacy was coincided with substance use and I just don‚Äôt want that type of relationship anymore. I rather wait for the right person before I share that part of me, now that I have a sober and clear mind. 


I can‚Äôt help but interpret his actions as pressuring me when he says ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs do a sleepover so we can go to (so and so event) together the next day easier‚Äù or things like when he asks ‚Äúwell when will we be able to be intimate?‚Äù and especially when he says ‚Äúoh I feel like you‚Äôre not attracted to me‚Äù. Also I will be likely going to rehab next month mid February (for 7 weeks) and he‚Äôs saying we don‚Äôt have much time and is scared to lose me when I go to Toronto for rehab.. but the thing is he wants to see me every other day pretty much and we have gone over that we both want to have time for ourselves, other loved ones, family and also each other but it would be all spread out. I feel like we have different interpretations of what we want and don‚Äôt know how to approach this without offending him more? We‚Äôve only kissed and held hands. But I find in recovery, I‚Äôm more vulnerable hence wanting to protect myself more and wait for intimacy. What would you guys do? Am I wrong to think this?

As a result of your engagement, we were able to present a compelling case to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide us with additional resources ($50,000) to engage with as many people as possible to understand the challenges of living with their medical conditions (e.g. opioid misuse) so, in collaboration with members of the affected population, we can develop interventions to ameliorate these burdens.

For those of you who do not know me, I‚Äôm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester participating in the NSF I-Corps Teams program to accelerate the societal benefits of medical research by getting scientists to hear from key stakeholders (e.g., patients, doctors, and insurers).

We are specifically interested in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid overdoses, and wanted to have informal conversations with those of you who have misused opioids (i.e., without a prescription, in an amount in excess of prescription, or recreationally).

2020-01-20 09:24:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/erdtpu/skip_the_suffering_kratom_allowed_me_to_quit/,Skip the suffering. Kratom allowed me to quit Opiates with relative ease and can do the same for you,"Recently I was thinking about how with today's shockingly large opiate crisis it's a shame that there are many people not aware of kratom's enormous potential for cessation of opiate usage. The difference between it and cold turkey is night and day. This subreddit may better reach those that aren't aware.

I'll start by saying that I was introduced to opiates through kratom (it's not really a true opiate, I know.). I took a few grams of it once every couple days for almost a year, edging on a light addiction to it before trying out oxy. Oxy immediately lured me in and within a month or so in June I was using it multiple times a day, no longer using kratom.

I first experienced true withdrawal in late July when my tolerance was getting higher and I started running out more often. It wasnt torture yet but at the time it seemed quite hellish. The only thing I could think of was that next dose. Nothing else matters. All within two or three months.

At this point, my thoughts were that as long as I have the willpower and determination, I can pull myself out in a few months if/when I want to stop since the physical withdrawal lasts just a week or two. I would use it for several days, then run out and withdraw. Each time it happened the withdrawal would feel worse and worse until December when it got so bad that I was genuinely concerned for my safety.

I decided to stop buying it and ordered a kilo of kratom for $80 online. It isn't the best quality, but for the price is unbeatable. I managed to try some high quality kratom from a headshop and it pretty much completely stopped my withdrawal during its peak, but I imagine that would become very expensive and addictive in and of itself. 

The effect of the kratom I had wasnt noticable during the first five days or so of withdrawal. As in, in order to feel it I would have to take so much it would make me puke. What it did was turn the agony down a few notches to the point of being manageable. Imagine going from feeling like you're literally about to die if you dont get a buzz to just having a shit day. 

Once you pass the peak you notice that you're not drawn to your kratom stash as frequently and if you take as much kratom as you can without getting nauseous, you'll feel close to normal. It gets you just to the point where you're not depressed but also not high. If your product is high quality or if you take a lot later on in withdrawal then you'll have a little buzz to work with, but nothing major. 

My last time taking an opiate was Dec. 26 and today is Jan. 20. I'll admit I started supplementing the kratom with lots of weed at day 7 but the worst was over then anyway. Adding the weed is big for mood and that depressing boredom you get during withdrawal. I would say that today or tomorrow is the last day that I physically feel the need for kratom.

The story doesn't quite end there. While I no longer feel physically dependent to opiates after 2 or 3 weeks of using low grade kratom, I do still feel depressed without any kratom. Although, less is needed each day. I didn't take any kratom until later in the day today, and I transitioned from thinking about opiates and feeling cloudy and grey, to feeling a cheerful optimism and a bit buzzy.

If it weren't for kratom, I would have endured so much more suffering than what is necessary. There are so many people that want to get out of addiction but dont realize you dont have to go through brutal inhumane agony or find a suboxone/methadone doctor that they probably cant afford. All you need is a little willpower and an $80 bag of kratom. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for the replies. Many people seem to be commenting about how it seems like using kratom is just replacing the opiates. If you have personally felt severe opiate withdrawal, it is best described as ""hell"" or, ""torture"". Kratom withdrawal is childs play compared to heroin or oxy, especially when you are using lower grade kratom. At this point im only taking it once a day for my mood compared to every 1.5 to 2 hours when I was in peak withdrawal. I don't feel trapped or controlled anymore, it's pretty fantastic,",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48289454}"

Hi all. My boyfriend/ex-boyfriend went to rehab yesterday. He‚Äôs dabbled with all sorts of drugs for a long time and over the last few months his heroin use finally became a full-blown addiction. His parents found out and after a joint effort with them we managed to send him to a centre that will hopefully keep him safe and help him for the next 28 days.

Over the last while, I‚Äôve watched him become selfish, mean, manipulative and cruel. This week, he confessed to me that he‚Äôd started injecting. He got so high yesterday that he didn‚Äôt even know where he was when his parents were driving him to rehab. I‚Äôm heartbroken for them that they had to see that. I‚Äôm told they‚Äôre crushed.

I imagine the above is familiar behaviour to many, but I just wanted to give you some context. I know I should now focus on retrieving some sanity, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what he must be doing and feeling. (Part of me hopes there‚Äôs a healthy amount of guilt involved.) 

For those of you who have gone to rehab, what happens in the first few days? Both in practical terms, but also 1 what thoughts/feelings go through your head? Anger, fear, resentment? Hope? Guilt? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different for everyone, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious.

Long story short- got introduced to norcos in 10th grade (dad had several back surgeries) and was addicted for several years in my late teens. Went to rehab/counseling and recovered relatively well. (Also I‚Äôve been diagnosed w PTSD from several years of sexual abuse as a child to explain my proclivity towards drugs at such a young age.) 

I‚Äôm 29 now and the first relapse I‚Äôve ever had in those ten years from then and now happened 3 months ago. Not even sure how it started- I‚Äôm a new dad so I‚Äôm guessing some of the stress of that. Regardless, I was popping whole 30mg oxys‚Äôs four times a day two weeks ago and at the height of my usage. Super disappointed in myself and thought this could never happen to me- go figure. 

Since then, I‚Äôve tapered down with tens and I am currently taking 15 mgs of hydro once a day. I‚Äôve felt like shit the last two weeks and even came clean to my wife about everything (super shitty) but I have been able to operate as I don‚Äôt have the option of rehab/taking time off right now. 

I was in Vegas the last two days installing some flooring for a convention and working extremely physically hard. As such, I haven‚Äôt taken anything for 1.5 days. As soon as I drove back to so cal I panicked and bought two blues from my dealer and took half of one. I was super sore from working hard and used that bullshit excuse to get high. 

I‚Äôm super frustrated with myself and I feel like I just blew two weeks of a hard taper and feeling like dog ass. I know that my relapse is short enough to get through withdrawals in probably 3 days but I‚Äôm just so goddamn scared. I keep psyching myself out.

I decided to use subs as I am a lifelong drug addict. I remember the first day I smoked weed from then on it was every single day and 16-20 every single weekend id try different drugs. so being clean is really far from my normal. Then of course, a straight 10 years oxy to heroin habit from 22-31ish.

 So I decided to use subs. I am on 4mg a day. with the plan to taper off subs as fast as I can comfortably do it. As long as it isnt that extreme cold turkey dopesickness it is a large difference in my ability to fight through. 

I know people look at subs as still being on opi's. but as long as it works as a transition tool and ones not on it forever it is a pretty amazing thing. I still am just so not used to not having to go pickup every single day. I'd say thats the hardest transition. Obviously combined with re-learning how to work through triggers and cravings. I go to meetings, I don't have a sponsor yet but will find one soon. Wanted to post so if any others are just tired sick of the constant up/downs of heroin, basically u almost never have peace. That switching to suboxone took about a week for me. Its such a difference! And last time i got on subs I felt so good about it and picking up 1 time turned into a year long run of never being out. So it shows the truth in picking up just once is never just once. last year I was on subs and decided Id just pickup 1 last time, use for a week, then go back to subs. Well Finally, after a year, I am back on subs with the intention to get off subs by Feb/April. So thank you to everyone here, all of your messages and posts, without this community I don't think it would have been possible.

I have been a long time follower of the sub, but this is my first official post. 

I am going to be detoxing this weekend/ following week for about the 1000th time. I will be going the CT route without suboxone / methadone. 

I have read many other posts from users on this community saying that pregablin or gabapentin slowing with clonadine can  help with the withdraw symptoms tremendously.

My question is how does one go about getting those meds prescribed? I don‚Äôt need a long term script of either of these meds, just long enough to get through the withdraws and to help me feel good enough to work for a couple of hours each day so that I don‚Äôt lose my job. 

Should I just be honest and tell my family doc that I am going through an opiate withdrawal and cannot eat / sleep and these are medicines that are known to help, or is there any better way to go about it to ensure I can get these comfort meds.

Not sure it matters but my therapist knows what‚Äôs going on and knows I will be detoxing this weekend and also agrees these meds usually help make you a little more comfortable but has no power to actually prescribe them.

I was prescribed codeine following surgery and continued to use this for many months after when I didn‚Äôt need it. Once I was not getting high from this anymore I then progressed to a stronger opiate. 


I then was addicted to Oxycodone which was very readily available to me without needing to purchase as a family member is prescribed it for breakthrough pain but does not take it as they are also prescribed a stronger opiate. 


I began stealing the oxy, which of course made me feel guilty, but not awful as I knew I was not taking pain relief from somebody and leaving them in pain. 


I have reduced from 120mg of Oxycodone a day to now nothing at home, whilst working full time.

So my puppers yelped at me one day when I came home from work for her walk and tried to pick her up. A few vet visits later, she starts to lose her back legs a little and turns out she has a herniated disc in her back and needs surgery. 

We ended up having to drive 2 hrs up to an animal hospital with a neurology team, ended up maxing our credit card and emptying most of our savings so she could get the surgery she needed. That drive back after leaving her there suuucked.. waiting for the doctor to call, waiting to hear if she made it through the surgery.. 

We were pretty pathetic sitting in the In N Out parking lot, our eyes still puffy, scarfing down double-doubles and fries at 9 pm. lol.

Drove back up there last night to get her, all went ok, she still has feeling in her back legs, just needs time, love, and meds. 

So of course they sent her home with Codeine and Gabapentin and muscle relaxers and Trazadone.. 

I was cracking myself up last night thinking about how the old me would be googling ‚Äúcan you take dog muscle relaxers?‚Äù while trying to play doggy nurse.

All I know is that as stressful, and emotional, and soul-draining as this last week has been... I could face it head-on and not have to worry about whether I had enough whatever to take with me out of town or trying to snort pills in a strange bathroom. 

Plus we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to even get the surgery if life wasn‚Äôt 180¬∞ from what it used to be. When did I ever have a fucking credit card or savings when I was using?? Or pet insurance to hopefully reimburse us?? 

It‚Äôs just a reminder to me that life keeps chugging along whether I chose to fight my space-time position or whether I accept life on its terms and keep putting one foot in front of the other. That if I keep surrendering, keep changing those old habits, the world can‚Äôt help but change around me.

I am a recovering alcoholic. Went to AA and have been sober 31 years.

But what I am seeing with opiates is shocking to me.

In the past 4 years, 4 of my adult friends have lost a child in their late teens or 20s.

And now a cousin at age 28 died and I just found out yesterday.

This kid was so full of life. Hunting, boating, fishing, water-skiing, wake-boarding, motorcycles, scuba diving, mountain climbing, boxing, MMA ... just balls out every day of his life.

But he had trouble, too. As a teen, shoplifting, car burglaries, and possession charges.

Good family.

So he gets in a big fight with family one day and the police end up bringing in the swat team. They arrest him.

OK, so with a good lawyer from his family he gets withheld adjudication in exchange for doing an 18 month inpatient drug program and staying out of legal trouble for 5 years. If he fails, he gets 5 years in the state pen.

He completes the 18 month program and just has 3 1/2 years to stay out of trouble.

One month out, busted trying to buy drugs. So he does 4 years in the state pen (but it counted as 5, don't ask me).  I sent him books and money for the commissary. He gets out in Nov 2017, seems to be loving life, does a commercial diving certification, gets a job, meets a girl, has a child.

And then he starts using opiates again. She cuts him off. He makes promises. On social media, he's talking about how much he's loving life and getting his life on track again. Seriously, the day before he dies.

Then I guess his luck ran out. He gets more pills. ODed. Dead.

WTF?

How do you 4 years in the state pen for drugs and then go and use drugs?

That is because it takes 3 days for all the dope to leave your system. Once all the heroin is gone, then your brain get the chance to start to normalize, slowly diminishing physical  WDs. My question is; since Narcan causes the opioids to pop out of the receptors, which immediately induces full WD, could taking it kind of ‚Äúskip‚Äù the first 3 days that it would take for your body to get rid of the dope on its own? That way, your brain can get a head start and immediately start to normalize.

I don't know if any of you remember but almost two years ago I made a post on this subreddit asking for peoples stories because I was making a feature film about opioid addiction. Well it's done! I made this film in college with a bunch of my friends and while it didn't get into any festivals we are all really proud how it came out.

I want to first thank you for your stories and reaching out to me to talk more.

This film doesn't really focus on actual drug use at all and it's extremely mild. There shouldn't be anything triggering here. The entire purpose of it was to basically note that the lead character is an addict but show that more importantly he is a person trying to conquer something to better and rebuild his life.

I really tried my best to show this as best I could and I hope if any of you get the chance to watch it you are pleased or and I didn't do anything to upset or offend anyone.

Thank you all again

I didnt mark my last day because it wasn't planned, everything I was getting was shitty and I was so tired of (basically) constantly being unwell. I had enough money for sub or a bag and got the sub then never went back. 

Anyways, now that that's out of the way...

Lately I've been feeling nostalgic. I've been stuck in a hotel for work stuff and therefore limited to cable TV.  There are so many shows that have reruns playing that I had binged while using (criminal minds, house, etc.) and it's just making me miss it. Being in a hotel, too, has it's own memories with using... 

I'm glad I'm away from home because I am safe with no means of grabbing. And going through airport security without a bunch of bullshit is so underrated, though I still felt nervous for some reason lol Plus I'm definitely enjoying the new area more and will remember much more from this trip (which is good because it's for a training). 

I just can't shake this craving right now. But I ordered some good food and am j chillin. I'm proud of where I am and can see good changes in myself, especially after perusing my journal. But... ugh. 

The most fucked up bit is how I'm even feeling nostalgic for the gross parts, too. Usually remembering being sick and waiting on dude helps me dismiss any lingering cravings.. but I'm remembering now how good it felt to get that 'good to go' text, meeting dude, and instantly feeling amazing (not just well/better).

I am seeking an online opioid (and alcohol+other drugs, to a lesser degree) recovery program/group that is nonprofit/free (or asks for only optional dues/donations). My ideal would be replicating via Skype or some other program a meeting that is regular and community/discussion-based e.g. AA or NA (but not limited to 12-step programs; I am very open to alternatives). I've been part of forums such as this one in the past, but I'm looking for something more intensive and personal right now. If you care to know the reasoning for my limitation, please see the below paragraph--if you'd rather drop some info on me straightaway, go on ahead.

I'm an American expatriate and opiate addict, alcoholic, and among various other things, and I am currently in a buprenorphine MAT program in Southeast Europe. My doctors speak English here, but no one else in the program does. I have experimented with 12-step programs in the past, and I've always dropped them almost immediately. However, I now realize I need more community than I have access too. In addition, I recently read The Recovering by Leslie Jamison and it made want me want to give it a real shot. However, because of my career, I am usually in countries where few people speak English, and there are certainly no NA/AA groups that do so. I do my best to learn the local languages, but there's a long way from being passably conversational and being able to understand and spell out your deepest feelings, urges, and horrors, so I usually have no option to attend local meetings.

So i have a friend who was sober for almost 3 years and had about a month long relapse herion bender. I am letting him detox at my house. I guess my question is what it his timeline for detox going to look like. Im trying to help him through the process. His last heroin dose was Friday around 11pm. 

Saturday night i gave him 1 mg clonazepam to help sleep.  He felt anxious but not violently ill. I gave him .5mg clonazepam every 4 to 6hrs on Saturday and he seemed ok ish. Still anxious and dizzy. 

Sunday is when the diarrhea started and he told me to give him ¬º of an 8mg suboxone strip, than another ¬º 30 mins later and he seemed better. He asked for the other 4mgs suboxone before bed Sunday night and along with 1mg clonazepam slept pretty good.

Monday was about the  same .5mg clonazepam every few hours, 8mgs suboxone over the course of the day. Today his hands are shaking badly and I've got some imodium from the store. He only has a total of 4mgs clonazepam left and he doesn't want to take too much suboxone. Since it was only a month long relapse will he be done with the  worst of it today?

I had will power, but I didn't control the will power, something stronger than me did this. As soon as a woke up this day I thought: ""I need to get off methadone asafp""

The best advice of all and not very known by many people. Get yourself some Lyrica (Pregabalin). You probably know it, it's a GABA derivative like Gabapentin.

Lyrica takes away almost all withdrawal symptoms but not the crying. You will always wake up and start getting sad about what you did to yourself and your life.

BUT IT TAKES AWAY ALL BODY ACHES.

‚ÄãLyrica works by the calcium channel alpha2-delta. Eat Magnesium and Calcium for potency and more relaxation.

There's no such thing as a medicine that takes away more withdrawal symptoms than Pregabalin. And you can taper out of Pregabalin without getting withdrawals. I've used them for mood stabilizaion for many years and I found out one day that I forgot to take my methadone because I ate 600mg of Pregabalin.

You get a little euphoric from Pregabalin (a little much) but the point is; you can taper without feeling awfull.

It even takes away your diarreah. And trouble sleeping.

&#x200B;

There is no such thing as a better solution to withdrawals.  Several friends did it.

&#x200B;

**Harm reduction:**

Some people took my advices and everything from 300mg to 600mg worked depending on your body weight. Do not exceed 600mg especially if you're small. This will give you amnesia.

I'm 100kg heavy so you can do the math yourself and find the dose you need to remove your withdrawals. I needed 600mg. 2x 300mg.",0,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48165005}"

My introduction to subs came in the form of the fucking Howard Stern show...when Artie Lange was touting his immediate recovery from heroin addiction by way of Suboxone. At the time I was chewing up 25 mg of percocet about 3-4 times daily and I could see where that was leading. I started asking around my normal sources and eventually found someone who would sell me sub strips every week. I think this was around 2007-2008 but I can‚Äôt say for sure at this point. 

At that point I started acting like I was some kind of recovering addict. My friends knew I was on opiates before that because I never really hid my addiction from them. After discovering Suboxone I felt relatively sober, and with no cravings. To me, I felt like a human again. Look how normal I am now!

Fast forward through a decade of weekly trips to the shadier side of town to cop. Multiple sources through the years. Multiple occasions where I get ripped off on the drug deals. I wanted out. The nagging question starts to rise up in the way back of my brain, ‚Äúhow is this any fucking different than what I was doing before?‚Äù 

The rationale that kept me using it was that I could never detox and still be able to show up for work. Work makes me able to afford subs and subs make me able to show up for work. 

So this year I decide I‚Äôve had enough and I take a 2 week vacation over the holidays. I tell everyone but my sister I‚Äôm flying out to see her and her kids for the holidays. Except my sister, she gets the truth. I actually don‚Äôt go anywhere. I took my last 2 mg the Saturday before xmas. Spend the next couple weeks sleepless sweating and twitching it out. Today, I am 3 weeks suboxone free. Went back to work last monday. I feel good at work. The distraction of being busy helps. 

I don‚Äôt feel too hot today. There is this general feeling of angst throughout my body that doesn‚Äôt seem to ever let up. Yet, there‚Äôs a large part of me who feels like I‚Äôve been sleepwalking for close to 20 years and now I‚Äôm suddenly awake. Emotions! Holy fuck the emotions. I haven‚Äôt felt anything in so long. 

These are the breaks. I knew this wouldn‚Äôt be easy. I wonder if I will ever feel like a normal human again. Then I think what right do i have to even expect that. You reap what you sow. 

I‚Äôve taken Kratom a few times at the hardest points. I really do not like how fucking close that feels to taking a painkiller though. Like my nose starts itching and everything. I will not be replacing another addiction so today I am just trying to come to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm going to feel fucked up and depressed and anxious for as long as it takes. Maybe forever? Fuck.

I wonder when I will have the guts to tell everyone in my life the truth, as they deserve to know. My teeth are so fucked up from a general lack of self care for
so many years. My peers have full lives and families and I feel like my brain is stuck at 20 yrs old because that‚Äôs about the time I started eating pills and shut all my critical thinking down.

# Spiritual awakenings

Page 12  


""*Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps...*""  


Step Twelve  


""How will I know when I have had a spiritual awakening?"" For many of us, a spiritual awakening comes gradually. Perhaps our first spiritual awareness is as simple as a new appreciation for life. Maybe one day we'll suddenly discover the sound of birds singing early in the morning. The simple beauty of a flower may remind us that there is a Power greater than ourselves at work around us.  


Often, our spiritual awakening is something that grows stronger over time. We can strive for more spiritual awareness simply by living our lives.

I feel as if I never took pills, and surprisingly I have all my energy back, and my insomnia is completely gone. Last night I slept great with no Xanax. The only thing is I got sick right after about 11 days of sobriety, I‚Äôm guessing because my immunities were very low, and I‚Äôve been sick for about two weeks. This almost caused me to relapse because I didn‚Äôt wanna feel sick anymore. But compared to withdrawals, being sick felt like nothing. I‚Äôve had a cough though that doesn‚Äôt go away for about 12 days. So I can definitely tell my immunities took a big hit. Other then that, I have extremely sweaty hands all the time, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs from detox. But all I can say is, don‚Äôt be afraid of living sober. The first couple of day‚Äôs I was terrified, crying, anxious, but that‚Äôs all normal. Just know it happens to everybody and you are not a lone. It‚Äôs part of the process.

I‚Äôve started to notice some really positive physical changes. My youthfulness has started to return and I just look a lot healthier. I recognize myself in the mirror again. I finally got around to going to a general doctor and getting thoroughly evaluated. I was a bit nervous after 5 years of opiate/heroin addiction that it taken a toll and Im relieved and elated that outside of some higher cholesterol I got a fully clean bill of health. I did gain a lot of weight in a short period of time while on heroin but I‚Äôve begun working to overhaul my diet and I started by cutting out soda. I was always a fit and active person but I don‚Äôt know about you guys, I loved drinking soda while I was high lol. I also went to the dentist for the first time in nearly a decade. I was completely up front with the dentist in that I had a substance abuse problem and as a result neglected my oral health and he couldn‚Äôt believe how healthy my gums were in addition to no cavities and very healthy teeth.

From a mental health standpoint I am struggling a bit. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of shame and a tremendous amount of guilt over the bad things that I did while I was using. Some days I just can‚Äôt really snap out of it, I‚Äôm overly emotional, and just find myself crying a lot. Some days are just better than other days. One thing I haven‚Äôt gotten back to which I know would really help me is regular exercise. My doctor has suggested an anti-depressant but I don‚Äôt want to go that route until I exhaust every option.
I have become a lot more social and reconnected with a lot of family members and friends that I had lost touch with. I have a very strong support system that I lean on. I can‚Äôt stress how helpful that has been. Just being able to love honestly for the first time in my life has been so rewarding. Even before I became addicted to opiates I was often dishonest. When I became an addict it was like throwing gasoline on a fire.

As far as urges go and maintaining my sobriety, I feel stronger than ever. I associate everything hat has gone wrong in my adult life with opiates and heroin, so the thought of using makes my skin crawl. I‚Äôve even been around people using pills and shooting dope and have had countless opportunities to use again but I haven‚Äôt even had a fleeting moment where I‚Äôve wanted to get high. I know I‚Äôm somewhat of an anomaly in this sense, but I don‚Äôt know a single person who is using that is doing well and it kind of works as a deterrent in an unconventional way. This isn‚Äôt something I would suggest anyone try.
One thing that has really helped me is just working on myself. I‚Äôve been reading a lot. I also have begun to write. I‚Äôve written a few short stories that I eventually want to share on here. I‚Äôve become really into David Foster Wallace. I came across this commencement speech he gave at a college a couple years before he passed away and there is a portion that really resonated with me that I read every day. It‚Äôs become my daily mantra and words that I try to live by.


‚Äú The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. ... The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're going to try to see it. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. ... The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness.‚Äù

I did my best to keep this post a bit shorter than my previous update. I hope all of you are doing well regardless of what part of your own journey you‚Äôre on. Hoping everyone is healthy and happy and I‚Äôve been waiting my whole life to finally say, ‚ÄúHindsight is 20/20‚Äù.",34,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.56433386}"

Please help.,"Hello, I'm a 24 year old college student in Northern CA getting ready to graduate with my BS after next semester and I am addicted to oxycodone. I've never said this out loud before but I believe myself to be a functional opiate addict with no prior drug related addictions or mental health problems. I  was intoduced to painkillers (norcos) in 2013 when I got surgery on my torn ACL and was prescribed a (60 count I believe) bottle which I refilled once. Since then I have been taking opiates on and off for the last 6 years. I've really been taking opiates consistently for the last 2 years though, at this point I've grown dependent to oxycodone (taking on avg. between 2-5, 30mg pills a day) and have tried to stop on my own within the last few months, but have unable to stop. I'm on this forum today asking for advice on what I should do. Everytime I've tried to stop on my own I get horrible withdrawals and always seem to come back for more. I know I have so much life ahead of me and I really want to be able to graduate and get a job without having to live with this addiction. Even when I am able to go a couple of days without taking anything, oxy is all that I can think about and I become extremely depressed, anxious, and crave more. I'm double insured through Kaiser and Sutter and have been heavily considering going to Kaiser for treatment but I am worried about what will happen if I do. I work and am in college full time so I don't want to be checked into an inpatient rehab center which is what's held me back for so long from going to Kaiser for help. Also, not wanting my family to find out about this situation is extremely important to me. I've recently talked to my friend's mom who has been prescribed Suboxone for a while now and she said it helped her beat her opiate addiction. She's even given me some before which really helped a lot with withdrawals and killed my urge to take more opiates, but only taking a couple Suboxone after being on oxy for so long didn't help with the mental part of it. Once I ran out of the Suboxone I was able to go a few days without taking anything until I started feeling bad again and the need to take opiates came back into my mind, which then is when it all started up again. Overall, I'm completely mentally and physically exhausted from taking opiates and slowly killing myself so if anybody has any advice on how I should go about getting help or how the process works at Kaiser then please let me know. I'm scared that this problem I have is going to ruin my life if I don't get ahold of it before it's too late. I personally think that getting a prescription for suboxone would really do wonders for me because it really did help me when I was on it, I just don't think I really had enough to dramatically change anything. At this point, any advice or words of wisdom from people who have experienced what I'm going through would be greatly appreciated.

I recently came into a little amount of money and instead of using it to keep running I decided to check my self into an ibogaine clinic in Cancun because I'm so tired and fed up with California rehabs/ detoxes. 

I'm hoping this treatment will help but I'm incredibly nervous about tomorrow and was looking for some support. I've been following this sub for months and it's helped me make the decision to put myself into this radical treatment. 

Any support welcome. Love and support to everyone trying to get off this disgusting junk.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40851465}"

But how do you guys deal with the cravings?  They're almost worse than WD.  To top it off, my guy called and is all good.  I don't ever want to go through the physical WD again but its tough knowing its just a phone call away.  So far, I haven't caved, but just knowing its there its like its calling to me.

Day three cold turkey from snorting fentanyl laced heroin for 9 months. The hot and cold sweats are still lingering, restlessness still full tilt... no sleep yet. First poop this morning. I can't believe I'm enduring this. I never want to be controlled by this drug again.

(UPDATE) Day 4
I've actually somehow pulled the courage out of my ass to go to my old club and do a half assed boxing workout. I then went to a friends house and sat in a hot epsom salt bath for 20 minutes. I picked up some red vein kratom at a local shop. Had a hot cup of that and staggered a few doses of gabapentin. All three Ended up working like a charm to be honest and I slept pretty damn well!

(Update) The next day I picked up and used. Once I realized Kratom could ease withdrawals and not have to deal with the blocker crap... I went in hard until November 8th 2018. I got kicked out of my house, was living in my car, attempted suicide. And after living in what felt like hell, an old friend from high school came to where I was parking to sleep and asked me if I wanted help. I went to a detox, then a rehab, then a sober house and finally was accepted back home. I‚Äôve been clean and sober for over a year (absolutely no substances) thanks to aa.

Like if I look at r/heroin or r/opiates I‚Äôll kinda miss the ritual and stuff like that but don‚Äôt really have this urgent feeling of needing to use if that makes sense. 

Honestly I think it‚Äôs solely because I moved thousands of miles away to live with my parents for a bit and know I can‚Äôt really get anything without some big time risks. But idk? When I leave in a few months and go back to my old house will I crave it? Wtf will my mindset be like by then? These questions I ask myself make me wonder what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve been drinking 4 times a week or so, so maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs holding me over. Plus chain vaping, although the nicotine percent here is INSANELY low compared to the US.

My bf quit cold turkey on methadone for about 7- 10 days. I'm sooo tired I dont even know anymore. 
His dose was at 75-80mg.
Anyway

During , The bathroom smelled weird and I had asked him if he was smoking anything and he said no.  Everytime I have a feeling he's up to something 99.9% he is .
I am so aggravated !! Why do you lie???? Why!!!  I dont fucking care... just tell the f..kn truth!!! And dont make it seem like am fkn stupid!!!! I am not !! Yet I fall for his stupid fucking lies. Knowing damn well. So who is the stupid one here!? Ugh!! 
He tells me that when he tells the truth I always react mean and judgy.  And yes its true...  after the fact that he denied it 3 times before. 

Is this life even worth it??? Having trust issues, lie after lie????  Why is it so hard to be honest?? Its even more disappointing then him actually doing drugs. üò°üò©

Yes to ease his WD Symptoms he smoked a fentanyl pill .... yet it smelled the same as the other 3 . 4 times I had asked him these past days... 
Last night I told him did u smoke it or drink it?? He said ... I drank it.... So this morning I asked him again and said. Do not dare to lie!!! And he said I smoked it! And gave me attitude because I asked him. Why he lied about the other times then.... like wtf!!! And he said I already told u I didn't. So I have to pretty much either suck it up and ""believe him"" or I need to figure out if this is even worth it!
I'm so fed the f up!

I will support him 100 percent but why lie!!!!!
Help me or direct me to a group where the family of an addict can help me please. 
I try not to over think like he says I do. But I cannot help but feel betrayed over and over again. Thanks for reading this long...

He asked if we could still see eachother 2-3 times a week. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to fall back into a relationship, but I support him and his sobriety. Instead, for now, we decided to meet up for coffee or to ride bikes once a week. No coming over, no sleep overs. I just want him to know that I believe in him, and I want to hear the growth and the trials he is facing as he works towards sobriety. He also has no friends really in our city.

My boyfriend and I have been together for four months. Around the 1st month, I found out that he has been addicted to muscle relaxers since high school. As time went on in our relationship, I told him I would support his sobriety. He‚Äôs an amazing man when he‚Äôs sober. He has been the best boyfriend I have ever had: cooks for me, listens to me, cares for me, and also thinks about my needs. When he‚Äôs high though, he is ridiculously clumsy, acts very un-intelligent, and slurs his words. He isn‚Äôt him when he‚Äôs high. 

When I first realized he truly had an addiction problem, I went to nar-anon, a group that is here to support those who have loved ones with addiction. I learned a big thing there, which was that boundaries are very important with an addict. If you don‚Äôt stick with your boundaries, addicts tend to not believe the person and it becomes a more toxic relationship. I decided to be open and honest with him, and that I would break up with him if:

A.) He was high around me
B.) if he lied to me about using

He did both of these things. He also hasn‚Äôt truly made any steps to get better. He hasn‚Äôt gone to NA or rehab since we‚Äôve been together. I can‚Äôt help to be heart broken right now, because he is an amazing man. But I also know he can‚Äôt commit to a relationship if he‚Äôs not ready to work on his sobriety. Guys, I‚Äôm very shaken up. I know I did the right thing by keeping my boundaries and not enabling him. But I also feel immense sadness because I don‚Äôt want him to ever think he doesn‚Äôt deserve love and happiness. He deserves the world, and he deserves to live not being dependent on muscle relaxers for happiness.

He was so high that he couldn‚Äôt drive home earlier. He had work in the morning and his car is still at my place. I plan to get him in the morning and bringing him to his car so he can drive to work. After work, I plan to fully break up with him, when he‚Äôs sober enough to fully talk about it.

Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys...did I do the right thing as a loved one of an addict? Was keeping my word what he needs? I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to post this, but I would like to hear from people with experience.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5757379}"

I was tapered off extremely fast which caused withdrawals and I've been craving something to fill this new hole of an existence.

How is it so easy to break a clean streak? It takes so much courage and strength to say no yet is so easy and tempting to say yes. To top it off it takes 1 second to break what you've been building for weeks/months/years. Addiction is a scary thing.

I started using substances at about 20, I am 24 now and there isn't much I haven't dabbled with. Opiates have always been my favorite because of the warm glow I would get and a feeling of pure bliss. I was popping M30's multiple times a day and when those started to get costly I tried heroin for the first time, I instantly fell in love. At the beginning I was chasing the dragon but quickly started using the needle. Nothing compares to the rush a fat shot would provide.

I got clean for a couple months but owed my guy a substantial amount of money and when I went to pay him I fell into old habits. I went home with the gram and some pressed bars feeling guilty but excited at the same time. I smoked a bit and took one bar. Next thing I see is the floor in front of my face. I try to get up but can't pull my legs beneath me because it feels like they are asleep...this time more so than I've ever felt. I started to get worried and called for help but couldn't move and my phone was dead. I was stuck on the ground for 8 hours before getting help when a family member found me and called 911. I was admitted to the ICU and placed on intubation after being diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure. When I woke up the first thing I saw was my legs which were swollen 3 times there normal size. They placed a catheter in my neck and started me on dialysis 5 hours a day, removing  5 liters of fluid a day for a week straight. I was told I'd have to learn how to walk again if I could make it out of a wheel chair and would have permanent nerve damage.  

After removing some fluid and swelling I was moved to post care to be monitored then evaluated before being considered for discharge. One night I awoke to a pool of blood the size of a basketball on my pillow. My catheter had been pulled/moved too much while I slept that it came out and was leaking which required a doctor to come at 2am and stitch my neck up. I developed pneumonia at this time which started causing lung complications. After several x-rays I was diagnosed with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or ""wet lung"". I was coughing up cups full of blood tinged fluid. Something I'll never forget is the look on the group of doctors, one specifically nervously looking toward me as she said I was headed back to ICU.

I was placed under anesthesia and intubated once again when I got to the ICU. When I woke up I had even more wires connected to me but couldn't talk for an hour in risk of damaging vocal cords. At this time I found out three days had passed and felt something hard to explain. It made me realize how small we are, To have three days pass and not be a part or even really there for them. I tried to laugh it off and on my pen and pad wrote ""Is trump still president?"" which lightened up the room. The hour went by and my doctor came in to explain how I was doing. He did an ultrasound on my heart which now had wires inside of the different chambers. I found out that this device was placed due to me suffering multiple organ failure. My heart, lungs, liver and kidneys had all failed and caused me to flatline for three minutes before being resuscitated by CPR. I got to see my heart beat through the ultrasound though and even saw an aortic valve flap. 

I saw one more thing that got me thinking. I have an awful memory but distinctly remember what felt like waking up during the second time I was placed under. I saw a single doctor on my left side and several tubes going down my throat. I asked if it was a feeding tube to which he nodded yes, next I asked what was in it. His reply ""McDonalds"" followed by the feeling of cold fluid going down a line in my throat made me cringe. Come to find out this could've been the time at which I flatlined. I think the real question in all of this; DID I EXPERIENCE HELL???",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44282568}"

And it wasn't just a few times like it usually is because I'm on the monthly Vivitrol shot. No, I stopped getting Vivitrol in September because the clinic where I get it told me when I went in for my shot that my health insurance decided the clinic was out-of-network, and because of that I owed a back balance of almost $1000. I got my shot, said see ya, and left. Didn't make a follow-up appointment for my next shot. Why? Because there was no way in hell I could afford to pay my balance and they wouldn't even put me on the schedule for my next shot unless I paid it. Thus, no more Vivitrol for qui9.

Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Then a coworker and friend died of an overdose after just celebrating one year clean. Then more people in the community died of overdoses. Then I was having stressful interactions/lack of interactions with my supervisor at one of my jobs. And you know, it's all normal life shit that normal people deal with every day. But I wasn't on Vivitrol, and that's been my safety net for a long time. I decided to pick up and started shooting heroin again. I figured I would stop after a few days, but because I didn't have the blocker in me, I really felt the drugs in a way I haven't felt them in a long time. I kept using.

After three or four weeks of using every day, I realized that I was physically dependent again. I thought I could fix it on my own. I reached out to my primary care doctor asking for her to rx me a small amount of clonidine and gabapentin. It took her three days to get back to me, but when she finally did, she told me she couldn't/wouldn't help me because it's not her area of expertise. She told me to go to detox. I reached out to my psych doc, the guy who gives me my antidepressants, and asked him for the same thing. He at least rx'd me seven 300mg gabapentin, but he wouldn't give me clonidine unless I came in to see him so he could take my blood pressure. It took a week but he managed to squeeze me in. When I went to the appointment, his blood pressure machine wasn't working, so no clonidine for me. He was nicer and more understanding about it, but he also told me to go to detox. 

With the help of a friend, I scheduled an intake at a clinic to start a 30-day outpatient detox program on Tuesday 12/31. I figured I would use until then, but I would tell my husband what was going on the night before so that he could be in the know. I didn't want to go to him with a problem (I'm addicted to heroin again, oops) without having a solution (outpatient detox program). On the Friday night before my detox appointment, I accidentally left a needle in the bathroom. My husband found it. All hell broke loose. 

From there, some more stuff happened, but I don't want to talk about it here because it's still fresh and painful for me. But I did manage to get an appointment with an addiction medicine doctor the next day (a Saturday, can you believe it) and I started an 8-day suboxone detox taper on Sunday. 

Obviously, wherever there are actions, there are consequences. I told my best friend about my almost six-week-long relapse. This girl has two years clean from crack, she's very much into NA, and she's blunt. Her brother owns the company I work for. After I told her about the relapse, she reached out to him, told him that I had relapsed, and told him to fire me. On one hand, I can understand why she did this. It's her brother's company, she doesn't want anything to jeopardize it, including me. On the other hand, what the fuck girl. I'm pretty angry at her for this. She says I have no right to be angry - I used, I lost my job. Consequences. What she doesn't seem to understand is that even if I have ""no right to be angry,"" I still have the right to feel my feelings. I have asked her for support throughout this whole situation. Her idea of support is tough love. She told me to go to 90 meetings in 90 days, get a new sponsor, get a home group, get a service position, etc... All this after we just had a long conversation about how after a year and a half in the rooms, maybe NA isn't right for me, maybe I'll branch out and try going to Refuge Recovery or SMART Recovery meetings again. Because of this situation, I lost my best friend. I can't talk to her without feeling resentful towards her. I'm pretty upset about it.

Well there you go, that's what I've been up to for the past six weeks. I'm working with the addiction medicine doc to schedule an appointment to get back on Vivitrol. I'm spending my days at home alone with nothing to do because I don't have a daytime job anymore. I'm looking online, I'm applying to anything I'm even remotely qualified for. I'm doing my best. I'm trying not to shame myself for this, but it's hard. I'm trying to keep my head up, I'm reaching out for help when I need it. I'm trying to keep my will to live. I'm going to get through this.

I still try and check the subreddit a few times a week, seeing all the stories here of people in day one and day two of withdrawals has been a massive help in continuing the fight.

I honestly think that sometimes when I'm reading the stories of people going through withdrawals it almost gives me PTSD flashbacks of the agongy I went through.

All I can say is keep fighting. It does get better, it gets better very quickly.  In the grand scheme of things, the few weeks of withdrawal are fuck all compared to freedom. I know how long those seconds take to pass during withdrawals, I know the pain and suffering you are going through, we all do.

I remember my last day of using, I remember my girlfriend coming home with a drug test, and me continuing to deny my use even when the results came back positive.

I remember the look of sadness and despair I would see in my girlfriends eyes every time she looked at me, I knew that she knew, she knew that she knew, yet I would lie to her face everyday and make her feel crazy.

I remember my life being controlled by powder. It would influence every single decision I made.

I remember the looks my co-workers use to give me when I'd come out of the toilet for what would be the 7th time everyday.

I remember sometimes when I would dose in my car before I went into work, I would begin crying and crying the second I used. Knowing I was well and truely fucked.

The thing is, I wasn't fucked... Sure, I felt like I was trapped and my back was up against the wall, but the solution was always the same, get clean. Get clean no matter what it takes.

This time I guess something just clicked, I was just so done. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I hated myself by the end of it all, all I cared about was getting high. I was a shell of my former self, I completely lost the ability to laugh and I was just so sick of living my whole life in shame, I hated being a liar, I hated how manipulative I was to the ones I loved me.

I remember after doing my last dose, praying I wouldn't wake up the next day to face withdrawals... And then I woke up, drenched in sweat thinking... ""fuck.""

Everytime I go through withdrawals, I make sure to have no comfort meds, as in my mind I wanted myself to suffer... This is stupid, you shouldn't want to suffer, you don't deserve to suffer... Get yourself some comfort meds.... Or suffer, a week is a week. 

One thing that really helped me this time, as silly as this sounds... Rubber bands (elastic bands) on my wrist. I flick myself with it whenever the thought of using popped into my head. My doctor recommended it to me, and hey it might be bullshit, but I must be doing something right. 

Weed. Thank God for weed. It made life bearable during withdrawals. Even if it was just to pass time, it fucking helped. Obviously if weed makes you anxious, this is probably not the way to go, but weed has always tickled my fancy. 

Aside from weed, I have cut  every drug and alcohol out of my life.

Things are just easier these days, no more unnecessary stress, no more pain and suffering, just life, a life I control. 

Things may not be as ""fun"" anymore, but they are nowhere near as BAD... Life's a trade off.

I achieved continuous sobriety starting three years ago by using alternative methods along with fundamentals from the 12 step program.


Changing my diet became everything.
Because I had done such severe damage mentally to my wellbeing I seeked alternative treatment (ibogaine) followed with a non 12 step holisitc program in Arizona.  We were taught about our LEF (our blueprint that stores all our trauma)  how to focus on the real issues that brought us back to using.  We were told to pay attention to the story we continue to tell ourselves over and over nin our head which ends up manifesting in reality.

Meditation became a huge deal for me in dealing with my anxiety and obessive compulsive thinking.  I also used positive material wether
it be books or music or videos on youtube.

I completely disengaged from old previous friends and contacts.  Who I was surrounding my self around was crucial into healing my mind and my beliefs about the world.  

Part of my using involved the nihilism and depression I carried around my neck.
I started to pay attention to the words coming out.  The less I complained about the world and my life the easier it was to deal with.

The first 6 months if you used as heavy as I did was a complete journey in of itself.

I attended no meetings at this time which I do not encourage.  Some people in my experience do better in 12 steps then others. I was not one of those people.  It was only from the previous meetings I attended when I was 20 at a treatment center where we saw people take cakes (1 year sobriety anniversary).  Those cakes were to plant a seed in me, seeing real life miracles take place and hearing stories about their recovery instilled a belief in me that I could do it. Recovery is possible.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5237832}"

I have Tues thru Sunday off of work and have decided it is time. I want to taper as best as possible this coming up week starting this Sunday. My question is:  I have (16) 2mg Suboxone strips. Should I taper as best as possible with opiates this coming up week and then quit for good on Monday, or would it be best to go into withdrawal this Sunday, and then use small amounts of the Suboxone I have to stave off withdrawal for the week and then stop the Suboxone for good next Sunday? 

So to summarize: This coming up Sunday thru Sunday/Monday I will be doing a quick 1 week taper and then quitting CT the following Monday (Jan 13th).  Should I use the lowest possible doses of opiates or Suboxone this coming up week? (which will make withdrawal less severe when I quit for good the week of Jan 13th)

Whenever I start to type my thoughts flee from me. I know I need to get some of this shit out of my head, but I stare at the keyboard long enough and suddenly I realize I need to get back to work or vacuum or something. 

I‚Äôm a strange case. I had 10 years clean off heroin when I went through a devastating break up with my sons mom and my ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù gave me some Suboxone and said ‚Äútry it, see if it works.‚Äù I had no idea what I was doing, but taking a tiny piece got me high as hell.. so naturally I kept taking it. 

Time passed.. like it does. I was singing in a local band and working full time, doing the single dad thing... all while becoming more and more fond of this little secret dope habit. More time went by and I met my future wife, fell in love, and more time went by. 

I lied to everyone, I lied to my sober friends, I stopped going to meetings long before so that was easy, but I cut ties with some of my best friends in the world under the guise of ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs in a relationship now..‚Äù and more time went by. I asked her to marry me, we started planning, and I kept pretending.

Eventually my ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù got drunk and decided I was his enemy. He spilled the beans and I was given an ultimatum. ‚ÄúStop or I go‚Äù so I stopped. Suboxone withdrawal sucked, I hated every minute, and I was miserable for months. 

Right before the wedding, my buddy came back around and apologized. We let bygones be whatever and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, the next thing I know I‚Äôm back on bupe. Back to pretending.

I am a great pretender. I spent 6-7 years snorting Subutex a few times a day and keeping it a secret. I would go once or twice a month and fill my guy‚Äôs script, then drop half of it off and go home to ration for the month. Time just went by. My kids got older, we bought a house, my wife had a great job at the time, and I just kept on pretending. 

Pretending I wasn‚Äôt addicted. Pretending I was stable. Pretending I was free. 

Then last year I found myself in the bathroom again, trying to clear my sinuses so I could snort more shit, and I had a moment of clarity. I‚Äôd been on pills for almost a decade, and it was only a matter of time before my wife found out and I would be caught between the hammer and the anvil. 

Then some higher power intervened. My friend relapsed on heroin and started to need my ‚Äúclean‚Äù pee. We kept this up for a little while, but junkies don‚Äôt stay clean cut for long with his habit. Soon the doc found out and kicked him off the program. 

It was time. 

I saved up 50+ 8mg Subutex and I told him good luck. I cut my dose in half every few weeks and time went by. I jumped at 1mg on thanksgiving, and I have just over a month clean (again) today. 

I just keep pretending. Now I pretend like it never happened? I just keep getting up and making coffee and going to work and pretending like I‚Äôm not hurting. Pretending like I‚Äôm not craving. Pretending like nothing ever happened. 

They say don‚Äôt tell people you‚Äôve wronged them if the only thing it will do is make you feel better and harm them... so I put my AirPods in and I listen to music and the days go by. I wish I could tell me wife the truth, I‚Äôm sure on some level she knows, she‚Äôs smarter than I am but she‚Äôs not an addict.

He's pretty well educated about that type of thing so him warning my brother and I about it shook me up a little. I know the chance of the US getting bombed is slim but regardless of what happens here in our privileged safe environment shit is definitely about to go down. It prompted this silly thought that even if the world was about to end I still wouldn't do dope. I'd rather die sober which is a thought I'd never had in my life until this past year. Morbid, but good, lol.  

Yesterday I was off on a weekday for the first time in like 6 months. I spent most of the day in bed recovering from my rough ass nye/ new year's day shifts but eventually got my ass up and did laundry (how I wish I had a w/d unit in my house or even just in this building üò©) and cooked a meal. I have a rule for myself that I only allot 5 days a year for staying in bed and doing nothing productive, and that includes sick days, so despite feeling totally wrecked I'm glad I got up and at least got a few things done. That awful feeling of uselessness that creeps up on me after a day spent doing absolutely nothing is one that reminds me too strongly of spending 60 hours in bed writhing around dope sick and one I would gladly never experience again.  

How is everyone doing today? I spent the morning scrolling through various dumb but hilarious subreddits (r/youngpeopleyoutube is a fucking trip) and drinking coffee, something I will definitely not have the luxury to do once school starts back up again. Im still slightly conflicted on my major; I'm glad I transferred to business general so that I can do dual admissions to a 4 year school for marketing, but I really really loved my previous fashion marketing and merchandising major as well as my prof who was the dept head, and I also had the top grades in the entire major and class (it's a new major this year so that's not saying too much but still). I just wish the degree program wasn't designed as a work study Cuz I'm pretty dead set on getting my BA in marketing but I fucking LOVED that class and would do literally hours and hours of work on projects and enjoy every minute of it but since business general major has zero fucking electives I can't take any of the other classes in the FMM major üò© shit really sucks but im hoping im making the right decision for ~my future~ here.

I worked an 11 hour shift on new year's eve, made the most money I ever had in a single shift, and had an existential crisis and cried on the drive home while listening to old punk songs that I loved circa 2009-11. Good times. I had to open the next day which sucks since our last big party were total pieces of shit and didn't leave until 11pm even though we closed at 10pm and ordinances legitimately prevent us from having patrons inside the restaurant after 10.30pm (we're BYOB so the state has really strict laws about operating hours since no liquor license) so I got like maybe 3 hours of sleep then went back to work for another 9 hour shift.  

I was so fucking exhausted yesterday and if I'd have known how busy it was going to be I swear I would've stayed in bed. I think we all would've lol, my cashier was swamped with delivery orders and angry drivers, my kitchen manager was off the day before and isn't usually and was furious with the sous chef for barely doing any prep the day before, we were so short staffed that the dishie, who has been on prep for a while but she's still learning grill and garde, was thrown on the line for the first time 20+ tickets deep for at least 6 hours straight, my manager had to hop on grill (you KNOW its bad when a foh person has to do boh lol) and I had a FULL dining room like at least 30 covers at all times and hosting, bussing and running duties were all on me as well as anything else pertaining to serving dine in covers, and all this on 3 hours of sleep (my manager only slept 4 hours as well)...  

 there were multiple points where her and I looked at each other and weren't sure whether to burst out laughing or burst into tears lmao. It  had been a really long time since I'd been in the weeds like that but we all made it through miraculously with zero mistakes on any orders, we closed early thank God so I got out of there at like 4.45, got a lyft home, ordered pizza and then passed out at 8.30pm and slept until 10.30am.  

Overall im exhausted right now and am so glad I have nothing to do today. When I think about this time a year ago, I remember how I was literally praying that I would be clean for the next new year. I also realized that this will be the first full decade of my life without using any full agonist opiates. Ofc 94-00 I didn't use because I was a small child, but I did my first ever prescription opiate pill in 08 and by 09 would buy them whenever I came across them. 10-19 ofc i used for at least 50% of that time and was strung out for at least 4 years total. Kicking dope was still to this day truly the hardest thing I've ever had to do, harder than doing two group projects meant for 5 people each by myself then winging the presentation on 4 hours of sleep and still getting As, harder than working 4 12 hour shifts back to back, the only thing I think it could possibly be compared to is dealing with some of the abusive relationships I've been in (which makes sense considering brain functions pertaining to that are similar to those used with opiate addiction).  

Im sure I've mentioned this on here before, but when R and I first kicked, pretty much 100% of my mind believed it was ""just for show,"" just so we could say we ""tried,"" and that we would be taking the el up to the Northside within 48 hours to go cop again. But somehow, some way, it stuck. That feeling of the first few days without heroin is one I will never forget. My car getting impounded was definitely a catalyst for me to actually stick to it (I like to joke that instead of me going to jail getting me clean, my car going to jail did üò≠) and I remember taking a Lyft to the parking authority, finally listening to music again after months without it, beginning of spring air blowing through the window, and looking out onto my city without my eyes being clouded by heroin for the first time in over 2 years and finally started seeing all the possibilities and opportunities that could arise to me if I wasn't a junkie.  

Now here I am nearly 9 months later and my life contains things that I only dreamed about this time last year. I have over $1000 saved, I'm enrolled in school, I'm productive and happy and can take care of myself and my home and my dogs and even help out those close to me if they need it, and I actually like my life. I really never ever ever thought I'd be able to say these things and although 8.5 months is a while, it's also not much time at all, but there definitely have been plenty of instances where life was testing me but through altering the way my mind deals with and sees bad emotions and getting rid of my ""spinning the wheel"" tendencies I think that, as long as I stay vigilant and dedicated to bettering myself and my life, I can keep it up.  

How was everyone else's new year's? I think for me out of all the holidays new year's can be the most triggering (like the pressure to ""do"" something or get fucked up) so im really glad I was working and out of an environment where I could fall prey to temptation. If anyone is reading this and newly clean still feeling like total shit, ringing in the new year dope sick is an awesome start to this decade and hang in there because even though your mind feels like its eating itself alive I promise it will pass and it's all worth it! To anyone whos still using and reading this,  new year's is just a date and doesn't really matter as much as people say it does so if you're still getting high and want to quit just because you used in the beginning of 2020 doesn't mean you can't get the strength to stop because I believe in you and you definitely can! And to anyone reading this with many more years or months of clean time under their belt than me, what's something that has helped you moving into the year + clean time stay on top of your shit and find a healthy balance of continuing your recovery but not dwelling on it too much? Also you are amazing and an inspiration to everyone on this forum!

Compared to withdrawing every couple of hours, I obviously feel much better, but not great. What bothers me most is, I have to constantly use the bathroom. I had forgotten how regular I am, I go no less then 3 times a day, and spend the rest of the day with my stomach in knots. It‚Äôs a feeling of always being nervous, and I hate it. There‚Äôs nothing that I‚Äôm really nervous about, but I guess that‚Äôs just anxiety? I can‚Äôt even drink coffee without running to the bathroom. Besides that, I‚Äôve been struggling with my energy. I think it‚Äôs mainly due to alcohol consumption that has slowed my bodies process of healing. Today I‚Äôm having my first craving, I just want the stomach knots to go away. Weed has helped immensely but it‚Äôs unsustainable, my wife doesn‚Äôt want me getting high. Overall, things have gotten better, and I‚Äôm glad to be sober.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6285295}"

Al anon is mostly for alcoholism type issues, but I just lost someone close to me because of opiate use. He didn't actually die(not yet anyway) but I had to go no contact with him because the way he was acting was destroying my mental health.  He was my boyfriend, my best friend, and the person I shared everything with.  Now that he is out of my life I feel so empty and lonely.  I cried for days, but now I just sit in my room all day blankly staring at nothing. I am so depressed. I don't even have anyone to talk about this with. Part of me just wants to take heroin myself to see what all the fuss is about...so I can find out why he ultimately chose substances over our relationship. I have never felt so unloved in my life. By the time I left him he wasn't even acting like himself anymore.  I no longer trust him in any capacity. Even to this day he will defend his usage of pain pills. He has called me abusive, manipulative and controlling for creating this boundary for myself.  I don't understand opiate addiction at all, but I grew up with alcoholics and developed a disorganized attachment style due to the confusing way I was treated as a child.  I feel so sad right now. My relationship was fine before any of this happened and I have no criticism of him as a person.  I feel like addiction stole something precious from me and feel so angry hurt and confused. Can someone who has gone though this type of situation please tell me something to make me feel better? Thanks",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.941811}"

I'm currently quitting snorting H by tapering down from 5 bag/day to 1, and used tramadol for 2 days to 'step down' a little more gentle.  It worked so far, 3 days w/o any dope and feeling 'ok'.

Yesterday I stopped the tramadol and moved to gabapentin to help ease the withdrawals.  It really seems to remove the majority of the detox symptoms quite amazingly (although it leaves your head in one hell of a cloudy state, ill take that over writhing in bed punching my legs in agony).  I'm truly shocked that I haven't had an opioid in 2 days and don't feel total agony... I know it's got to be the gabapentin as I've read so many reports about it's magic.

My question:  Is gabapentin a fucking miracle withdrawal drug, or is it just putting off the inevitable?  I guess I will find out when I stop taking it in a couple of days and see how I feel, but I would love anyone with experience in this to chime in.  I only plan on taking it for 3-4 days, as I know it is addictive in it's own right, and I really want to be free from these hellish addictions once and for all. 

I understand A LOT about opioid abuse, detox, withdrawals, and the step necessary to stay clean, so no preaching is necessary.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40696958}"

I'd been clean from coke for like a year or so and then a month or two ago got offered at a urinal and did it. I ended up buying the rest of the bag from that fucker and held on to half a 20 for like 3 weeks before finishing it. I said that was it.  It wasn't. Idk I got some twice more and yesterday for new year's eve I was spining all evening.  I went and bought a fucking ball that idk what to do with now because I'm fucking broke. I'm not that broke but I also don't want to throw away 100 bucks. I went back and fourth all night and ended up not touching it and I'm happy for that. Idk why I'm even writing this. I just wanted to share and I don't really think the people around me would really hear in an understanding way if that makes sense. But that could also just be my drug brain saying that. Thats probably what it is. I hope everyone is doing good. I didn't do a bunch of blow last night so I'm say win for last night. Any advice on what to do with this ball now would be appreciated...

I have an extremely compulsive drug-seeking behavior. I had 6 main addictions over my life; the most serious being opiates, cocaine and JWH - followed by tobacco, benzos and weed.

there is massive research about the role of glutamate activation on drug-seeking behavior ([reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633516/) , [reference 2](https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/latest-science/unraveling-mystery-glutamate-dopamine-connection)

NMDA receptor antagonists are relative new targets for treating addiction. ( [reference 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/) , [reference 4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gbb.12348)

when you abuse certain drugs like opiates, your body is depleted from water-soluble vitamins and minerals. the main issue here is the B complex, which is completely essential for proper brain function. 

another important one is magnesium, a natural NMDA antagonist and calcium channels modulator ( [reference 5 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30714574/) ,  [reference 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/)

I‚Äôm 16 days clean, and am currently suffering from psychological addiction. all this new year‚Äôs partying are a strong trigger for someone like me. on desperation 2 days ago I bought magnesium chloride powder and started taking a teaspoon on the morning and another at night. yesterday I woke up feeling much lighter and overall feeling good. I didn‚Äôt even connected one thing to another, I thought it was just my mind recovering, and today I noticed a huge mood-stabilizer activity from taking the magnesium. 

***I took magnesium only after consulting my doctor. this is an experience report and not a medical advice, always talk to your doc before ingesting any pharmaceuticals***

it really is working like a light general tranquilizer. i‚Äôm not having the compulsive and intrusive thoughts I usually get, im smoking way less and overall enhanced mental clarity.

in conclusion it is doing wonders for me. if any of you reading this decide to take magnesium make sure you don‚Äôt consume the laxative formulations (mainly oxide and hydroxide). if you are quitting opiates and take a laxative you gonna have a shitty time (pun intended)

magnesium chloride is not the best formulation, it is in the middle ground between the best and the worst, but it‚Äôs what I have access to.

this was my first new year I just slept through. I live in Rio de Janeiro and new years here is the nightmare of any drug addict; everyone everywhere is high to the bones, mainly MDMA and cocaine. 

like you don‚Äôt need money, damn, you don‚Äôt even need friends. just go to Copacabana beach and you have everything you need for free; beautiful women, for sure bump some old friend, drinks and drugs. ((as a brazilian)), if you are a gringo and try to do this, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time, no one will share drugs with you because gringos are known to pay absurd amounts of money on cocaine.

anyways I live literally 15min walk away from copacabana beach and it was hard to stay home yesterday. I sparked a lot of big flat blunts. I got extremely anxious around 10pm, hearing the fireworks. I just started imagining all my friends hvavin the time of their lives. it was fucking HARD. I had to take an extra benzo dose with promethazine to make me unable to leave home (I get reaaaally sleepy with promethazine)

anyways I woke up feeling so good that I didn‚Äôt give up and stood still against my ego. i‚Äôm depressed because of all the fun i‚Äôm missing but the pride to be able to stay clean is bigger. i‚Äôm satisfied as hell with myself.
