 I was scared of PWS so started with 1mg around 12pm ( about 20 hours after my last pharma oxy use), then felt I was good since I didn't start feeling worse and felt a tickle of relief so I took another 4mg  and felt complete relief from withdrawals.  Then took another 3mg around 7:30pm. They help SO much with the cravings as well, and knowing that the ingredient included in the sub would kill any opiate I took would block it helps to not think about using too.  Popped a 10mg edible around 9pm and slept better than I have in a long time.  Took 3mg this morning and know trying to figure out my dosage going forward...

So, I know your supposed to take subs at the same time every day, I'm still trying to figure out how I should do it.  Should I do 3 doses of 2.5 - 3mgs a day or just 2 doses of 4mg a day?  Any feedback is appreciated.  I would like to take the subs for as minimal time as possible and plan to cut the daily doses in half in a few days.",1,0

I was only doing .2-.3 for about 2 weeks then started to taper with measured doses each day and its almost been two weeks so its about 3.5 weeks total of use for this relapse and I am fully committed this time as ive only had a few runs with opiates ever so i am still fairly new to the game but my last run was last summer and it was quite long and the withdrawals were cold turkey and horrible , the run was 6 months and the withdrawals were bad but only lasted about 3-4 days of them being bad then used some kratom and it helped thereafter but like i said im down to .08-.1 and i was wondering when i can start with the 1 mg of subs to ease it in? Should i wait till im down to like.06-.08 ? Or can i start now ? I have about .3 of H left for the taper so im getting down to it now and feel like im ready to start adding in subs and  get more of that in my body and less dope , also i have kratom here so if that helps with the switch to subs lmk . I just am trying to make this as seemless as possible cuz i have to keep working and pay bills through this so im trying to do the easiest taper and switch to subs, and then once im on subs dont worry i only stay on them for a few weeks i dont like to stay on them for longer then two weeks if i have them after a run.

I'm a 35 year fuck-up with a masters degree but with a dead-end-up part-time job in retail and barely enough to cover rent. No friends, social anxiety and women wont even piss on me if I was on fire.My dad who was a life long alcoholic stashed pills and booze under his bed and when he died I grabbed some. Why? Not sure. I eventually ended up taking a 8 week (and still going) sick leave after some female co-workers began bullying me because they didnt ""like me"".  
I drank the booze, popped the dreadful benzo's (my dad had terrible taste in drugs and women). Then I remembered I still had some subutex stashed away.  
So every friday, saturday and sunday I would take 2mg subutex thinking I was a genius. The subs (trigger warning!!!) made me believe in life again and made things seem possible.

Two weeks ago a pattern emerged: Monday I would feel OK, still with sub in my system, tuesday kinda bad and then thursday and friday I would be in hell. I denied it being WD's and thought it was just giddyness for fridays high...But I'm addicted for sure.

I f\*cked up for sure. Add to his being prescribed Wellbutrin that just adds to the anxiety. I just scraped some sub dust on my gums and after 8 hours in bed I was finally able to eat something.

My question is: I hav 2mg left. Do I take these tomorrow as a final hurrah and deal with the WD that will come on tuesday OR do I divide it into smaller doses to taper down a week?

First time I properly WD'd I was prepared and mentally ready. Right now I have such suicidal ideation that WD is terrifying...

I know that it‚Äôs hard to be thankful when you‚Äôre down on your luck.

I have a roof over my head, money in my pocket, and I did not have to get high this morning. What a blessing.

I‚Äôll share a story with you all before I start cooking. I‚Äôve spent a Thanksgiving in rehab, peak withdrawal and was still on blackout for the phone. I couldn‚Äôt even call my father and tell him I loved him. And of course I made a big deal about it. ‚ÄúMy dad needs to hear from me. It‚Äôs Thanksgiving, he‚Äôs probably so anxious about me.‚Äù Well, in reality, my dad was probably the least anxious he‚Äôs been about me in the better half of a decade; for once he knows where I am and that I‚Äôm not getting high.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you call me?‚Äù
‚ÄúCome on Dad, if there‚Äôs a will there‚Äôs a way right?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou said it, not me.‚Äù

Pop dropped some knowledge on me that Thanksgiving. Maybe if I took that will I had to get and stay high everyday and applied it to getting and staying sober, I have a fighting chance at this. He was right. 

No more Thanksgivings apart for us, Pop.

Tonight I will be lighting a candle for: those who are still sick and suffering, those who are picking up for the first time today and those who will be picking up for the last time today. I ask that you do the same. Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

First off let me say that in no way is this a significant huge milestone to most people, but to me it‚Äôs huge. 

For the last 8 years I‚Äôve been gripped and addicted to codeine in the form of nurofen plus (strongest OTC available in the uk with 12.8mg of codeine and 200mg ibuprofen. 

I‚Äôve been taking anywhere from 3/4 of a box to a box every single day, coupled with stealing my parents codydramol (30mg) at any opportunity. 

I was tired of the lack of being able to shit daily, and without feeling like I‚Äôm giving birth. Tired of the sweats during the night. Tired of rotating pharmacies so I don‚Äôt seem suspicious. (This video is essentially what my situation at pharmacies was like) https://youtu.be/YWUTCo-D_J8

Today marks 12 days with ZERO painkillers, zero anything. 

For anyone looking to do the same I couldn‚Äôt recommend anything better. The first 4 days were rough with the feelings of a heavy cold (runny nose, body aches, restless sleep). Each day that went on I managed to feel better both mentally and physically and that brings us to today. No cravings, no aches. Just a guy thats tired of the feeling of living like Groundhog Day.

Would go months using, then hit some withdrawals and be clean for months, then use for months, repeat, and so on.  The withdrawals sucked but I was always able to power thru them.  Usually by day 3 I was good.  Beginning of this year I started using oxy.  Quickly became 100-150mg a day habit.  Sprinkle in a couple weeks of fent use here and there.

Anyway, was on one of my fent trips recently and was taking about 4 fent pills daily for almost 2 weeks straight up until 7 days ago.  Then 4 days of just hydro, about 70mg a day. And for the last 3 days I've been on 250mg of oxy a day.  I only have 90 mg left just to get me thru Thanksgiving.  I'll probably take my last 30mg in the afternoon.  So my question is, at what point would I be able to start taking my subs?  If I know myself, I'll be hurting pretty much by the time I wake up.  Might even start withdrawing midsleep.   Should I hold out as long as possible before taking my subs?  And what dosage should I start with?

From the bottom of my heart I wish you all the strength and sense of purpose or motivation you're struggling to find and I hope you all receive it in abundance. 

I did everything perfectly wrong and have spent the last year destroying myself and my life dating an addict and trying to build a future. 

I finally lost all hope that life will ever get any better. I hate everything about myself and feel sorry for everyone in my life for having to put up with my existence. 
I resent my so called partner for taking advantage of me and manipulating the wording of everything for their benefit. I resent the time, effort, love, support and money I've given or lost pursuing a relationship that just drained my soul black. 
Their effort was minimal and inconsistent the attempts weren't often so its not like I actually ever had a reason to let myself ever be hopeful.
Anytime things seemed to finally look up they suddenly had to and could be much worse.  When someone actively does nothing to reduce your stress and instead actively piles onto it with no regard for your mental health or the boundaries and needs you've expressed the relationship is poison.

I can't even handle normal life anymore and I don't know if I'll ever be able to again. I haven't actually relaxed since December of last year.  I can't even take care of myself how did I take on another adults care????

I am trying to do an at home detox. Isn‚Äôt my first time but I‚Äôm in desperate need of the usual detox meds (klonopine/clonodine/seraquil). Does anyone know of any tele-health doctors that prescribe these meds for an opiate detox? I want to be very upfront and honest about the situation and I feel like telling a pcp or standard dr. The situation they will just hear ‚Äúhi I‚Äôm a junky pretending to want to get clean so you will RX me a bunch of meds‚Äù I have absolutely no desire to stay on these (street fent mbox 30s) but it‚Äôs pure hell cold turkey and my situation is so dire I‚Äôm not able to will my way through it mentally. I can if I‚Äôm mostly sleeping thru it and the comfort meds make it bearable. Due to the for-profit rehab system everytime I‚Äôve gone I‚Äôve had to be in charge of my med regimen bc otherwise the doc will roll their eyes and say I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking abt and sub can be induced after 24-36 hours especially with a high cows score. And everytime my people pleasing ass gives in and wants to trust them, I go thru precip hell for days. 4-5 days is the magic number for me to start sub. Although I‚Äôd prefer to not stay on that either. Sorry for the long text just wanted to make it clear I‚Äôve tried it every other way and I‚Äôve done lots of trial and error to make sure I‚Äôm not wrong & there isn‚Äôt an easier way. I wish to God I was wrong. I wish every single dam day that my body wasn‚Äôt so resistant to inducing subs earlier than 96 hours. I‚Äôve even gone into pwd when trying to start right around 96 hours. I have no pride in coming off like a stubborn know it all. I will happily trade it and call myself an arrogant uneducated moron in return for a less painful solution. I‚Äôve looked into Bernese method as well. So if anyone knows anyone at all who can RX detox meds at home no matter how much of a long shot I will be eternally grateful. Im even willing to repay the favor if it works out. Wish everyone here love and happiness in sobriety. Places like these show the beautiful & compassionate side of humans and gives me hope. TIA ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Oh & ps: my goal is to be completely free of all meds including subs by 30 days depending on my body. All of this is temporary. Life isn‚Äôt worth living to me if I have to stay on anything that chemically numbs me. No shade or judgement to anyone who does or needs certain meds to function. I just can‚Äôt live life this.

So long story short, I have a bad back. I need to spinal fusions but because I have a small child I‚Äôve been putting it off. My doctor has never prescribed me anything for the pain. I‚Äôve just dealt with it. One day this past June,  I threw my back out. It hurt so bad I couldn‚Äôt sit, turn my head, or anything. I‚Äôm also a wedding photographer and I had two 12 hour weddings back to back that weekend. I couldn‚Äôt cancel, I had to tough it out. A friend of mine had some Percocets, I asked for a few to get through the day. I had occasionally taken them here and there over the past two years. The next day came I asked for some more however she didn‚Äôt have percs she just had an oxy. So I took that and split it up throughout the day. It helped tremendously. From that day forward I started taking them every day. It started with just one and then two and now it‚Äôs graduated to about seven or eight per day. But I don‚Äôt want to take them anymore and I need to stop but I just don‚Äôt know where to look and how to get started on this process. I‚Äôve never really had a history of using drugs except a brief period in my early 20‚Äôs but nothing I became addicted to. I‚Äôm very ashamed that I let this happen. I have a family and a very reputable business and I am just watching it fall apart. I feel like I am at a very early stage though that if I get in control now I can put this behind me and never looked back. I hate what this has done to me. This is not who I wanted to be. I never wanted to become like my mother as I grew up in a home plagued with addiction. It seems like every person and I try to contact or treatment facility, I haven‚Äôt been using long enough or I‚Äôm not in deep enough to be treated. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what is right for me? I would love to just go to a detox center. I would love to get through this without my children having to watch but I don‚Äôt know what I can afford. 

I did talk to someone today who mentioned a 5 day detox at a hospital, MAT??, and an ambulatory program as possible treatments but I just don‚Äôt know what to expect. I‚Äôm new to all of this. Is cold turkey an option? If so how should I start? 

I just want my life back. I feel so guilty looking at my children and I just can‚Äôt do this to them.

I'm a middle aged dude, *supposedly old enough to know better.* To my shame, I've been a pretty low user of codeine for about 14 years. Averaging 50mg to 100mg a day. Not much, but enough to be addicted. (Co-codamol 8/500 and Nurofen plus 12.8/200 -- 2 of each a day.)

I woke up last Wednesday and realised I don't want to take this shit no more. 
I'm addicted to anything with codeine in. I know it's probably less interesting than others, I've read some people taking heroin.. my addiction was 96 ish tablets a day, at ¬£10 a box, I went out every day to get 3 boxes which had then racked up a 7k debt. I had hallucinations, sweats, short temper, hunger and migraines among other things. And my stomach aches life a MF when I've had some. 

I'm a mess. 

Wednesday, I had enough of this shit. I'm staying at my boyfriends who is THE ONLY person I've told. 
I've cut my intake to be less than 20 a day, from 96... its huge. But I'm struggling with the psychological part. I've been relaxing my ""next dose"" with something like a bath or reading a book etc. 
I don't want to relapse, I cant financially do this anymore. 

I'm 28, female and broke. I want children eventually, I want the nice things in life, I want a normal life. Not to wake up in the morning thinking about which pharmacy I'll go to knowing I don't have the money in my bank to get more tablets.

I guess I'm just reaching out for a push to keep going.. I haven't had any physical withdrawing yet which I have had in the past, I'm wondering if that's because I'm telling myself this is what I want?

I was introduced to opiates my Senior year of high-school after a Football injury. Went on to college to play and was clean for about 2yrs. After that I end up getting a bowel obstruction and was hospitalized for 2 months all the while I thought I was going to die and I was going through my first break up with my high-school sweetheart. The entire time I was in the hospital I was on Ativan and Dilaudid everyday for 2 months straight 3x a day. I was still making straight As and made the deans list all while being hospitalized. I studied alot in there. After i got out i had a tube in my stomach and was put on a oxy 20s for the pain. Once my prescription stopped I was already extremely depressed from almost dying, not being able to play sports and I lost who I thought was the love of my life all while we had finals and later found out my mom was back on dialysis. So I remember from being hospitalized that the drugs made me fell SOOOOOOO FUCKING GOOD! It made nothing matter and I killed everything I did. So once I got out i tried Xanax the. A few months later I started lortabs. It gave me motivation to kick ass in everything I did. I got a new car, had. 3.8 GPA, joined multiple scholarship organizations and it tripled my motivation to workout so I got girls beyond belief. It was all good until my tolerance kept rising and rising. I‚Äôd find myself slurring and falling asleep everywhere. It got to where I couldn‚Äôt be me without it so I stopped. It was about a year then I got back on just pain meds until i met my current fiance in nursing school. I started again for like 8 months then stopped again then right before covid I started again but this time it was horrific. Id find myself spending every paycheck to get them no matter how hard i wanted to stop I couldn‚Äôt or id get really sick. So i went to a sub clinic, the first monty i was taking 3 a day then after that it just started to fall off. Ive been wanting to stop for months i was just hanging with the wrong people. Its been 4 months since Ive taken Suboxone or an opiate and its amazing all of the things ive done. I moved citys so i have no contact with any dealers. I dont even crave them any more. I had a surgery and I they gave me a small dose of oxy my fiance managed them just to be safe. I took them as needed and my life has really advanced. Im not a bragging person at all but take that leap. At once point I literally wanted to die because i saw how my life was being controlled by an addiction i had, but honestly when i think about being broke, living on the street or even being a slave to something that‚Äôs ruining who I am its so clear to say man fuck that. I know people are going to say slow down it‚Äôs early etc, but with an amazing support system and confidence/will power in yourself no one can tell what you can and can‚Äôt accomplish. My uncle was an addict for 25yrs i mean he could take 10-20 lortabs at once every 3-4hrs with some somas and not act high at all and hes been clean for 15yrs. Nothing is impossible. Once you take that first step and see what life is like when youre in control you‚Äôll never want to go back. I spent in a year an estimated 25-30k on pills,FUCK THAT

Started off w/ lean & xanz from 2014 till bout 2018 when I started poppin everything from 10mg percs to OxyContin (OP 20‚Äôs) then eventually roxie 10‚Äôs - 30‚Äôs in 2019. Everyday for da past 2 years I would run thru about 3-6 blues everyday. My previous posts were just previews of plenty of packs of oxys I‚Äôll have all in one time & instead of making money I was popping & snorting half of em. I blew thru about 250-400k just off my addiction. Could‚Äôve put that on Bitcoin & Ethereum instead. Withdrawals were hell. My body felt so weak & disoriented on days I didn‚Äôt have. Bed would be dripped in sweat & constant shaking I felt like I was having seizures. Mentally I was in the darkest place of my life I don‚Äôt think hell would begin to describe it. Even after accidentally snorting fent thinking it was a real 30 if it wasn‚Äôt for narcan I woulda been dead. Was that my wake up call? Hell no. Even after that experience only thing that made me was more cautious of what I was taking. It took me to lose everything from my girlfriend to my job to even the plug to realize what am I gonna do now so I hopped on suboxone to help w/ withdrawals then I‚Äôll relapse again till I finally made that mental decision this ain‚Äôt the life I wanna live anymore. I have really big & bright plans for the future & so does everyone here struggling w/ addiction. I feel better than I did before just sometimes till this day those random urges to just do 1 be kickin in but I gotta maintain this mental discipline to not give into it. Probably gonna start hitting the gym to get my body right. Coffee helped me a lot as well. Tryna quit weed as well since that‚Äôs another burden I need to get rid off. Helped me a lot w/ withdrawals but weed was never meant for me mentally. I know I‚Äôm not as bad as people who on dogfood or fentanyl but any addictions is bad in their ways & I hope I can keep it as well as others who are quitting this devil of an addiction like this for a long time.,12,0

One major thought disruption I‚Äôm struggling with is not feeling worthy of anything. I don‚Äôt feel worthy of love, of peace of mind, or just relief.

I had been addicted to roxies back when the pill mill in florida was happening. Kicked that with minimal withdrawals luckily and after that went down the wormhole of alcohol addiction. I never thought of myself as an opiate addict just an alcoholic (lmao). Some months ago fentanyl fell in my lap and thought nothing of it. After that follows a 4-5 month horrible and dark addiction. I know thats short compared to most but fuck it was powerful. I very nearly lost everything. My fiance, my job, my home. Everything i took so long to build. Finally came clean to my loved ones who knew something was up and quit but as you all know the withdrawals after using everyday for that long are fucking awful. So after reading a bit on reddit and using some things I already know i got a bunch of gabapentin and kratom a couple of mild benzos and alcohol. WELL i was popping gabbys like candy and downing as much kratom as possible trying to make it through work. One early morning after days of no sleep my heart starting going absolutely haywire. It felt like my blood turned to lava and my heart was beating out my chest and out of rhythm. I couldnt stand up. My eyes felt like they were rolling back. Couldnt focus my eyes on anything. I really should have called ambulance. Thank god it passed and the next day I checked myself into a detox unit. WEEELLLL while in there i met a middle aged woman who was also coming off of fentanyl and she had had a stroke while mixing gabapentin and kratom. 

TLDR: Be extremely careful mixing gabapentin and kratom during withdrawals. It may have almost caused a stroke and may have caused a stroke in the middle-aged woman. Also im proud to be sober :)",10,0

After lurking Reddit for addiction advice, I've finally decided to join what seems like a very informative & uplifting community. A little about me: F(30s), started using H about four years ago (luckily only ever snorted, no IV). Have gone thru withdrawals more times than I can count with a max of about 8 months clean until m30s hit the streets. Initially, I had no idea they weren't pharma grade. But here I am now, day four of detox once again. I slipped up the past month doing a small amount of m30s each day, had a very close call and decided it's time to stop playing with fire. I got to day 3 last week of withdrawals when my neighbor showed up at my door with a bag of my DOC, knowing full well I was trying to get clean and didn't want to fall back in. My dumbass held onto it for a day, then woke up the next morning itching to have a taste. So I used again for about three days then threw the rest away. I waited two days of full withdrawal before deciding to take .5 mg of a sub. Yesterday I took 1 mg, today slightly less than 1 mg of sub. Planning to jump off completely in the next day or two. I've done this once before with minimal discomfort on a very short term sub taper just to manage the initial physical pains of withdrawals, but that was a while ago.

So I'm wondering about any similar experiences anyone out there has had doing this method; think I'll feel alright if I jump off the subs after only 5-6 days on at nothing more than 1 mg a day? Tomorrow I plan on going back down to .5, maybe less, then <.25 the final day. 

Tysm for reading & any insights you have to offer. We are not lost causes as addicts & we all have so much to live for once we make that realization. üñ§",2,0

I was clean a year and then got hospitalized. At the hospital they gave me oxy and morphine for a week and sent me off with a 10 day supply. After that, I spent 2 months going between pressed percs and tianeptine. I thought the WD wouldn‚Äôt be so bad after 2.5 months but it‚Äôs been worse than coming off in the past from heavy multi-year use (though then, i always tranisition to kratom for some time before jumping). This time i went ct. Didn‚Äôt have anything on Friday, gave in on Saturday and took a few presses at night. Then have been off the 5 days since. First two days were cake because I had pharma ket that numbed me through the first 2 days. But i ran out and have been pushing through with all the comfort meds under the sun (no kratom or opiate acting stuff). I finally slept some with the help of clonidine, klonopin, ambien, magnesium, etc. 

Right now, i have 0 energy/motivation, I‚Äôm a complete mind fuck, and still having lingering rls and skin crawlies. Usually by now all of that minus the energy and mental stuf are gone. Now I‚Äôm wondering when I‚Äôll turn a page and why this time is so different after such short use. I‚Äôm fighting hard not to take small amounts of kratom to get through the day. I know it would make things way better but also will delay my progress. I keep telling myself the Kratom will make it longer but more manageable but at the same time i‚Äôm just ready to be done.

My energy has slowly come back from starting exercising, lifting a month in & eating as well as I can (routines help). Sleep still so-so, but it‚Äôs getting better. Social anxiety goes up & down like a rollercoaster, but I push on knowing it can & will subside.

Realization: It takes time to figure out who we are post using, more so if it was long term... it‚Äôs especially difficult with the problems we may have self-inflicted during use & the health problems that arise from our body recalibrating. 

The issues/traumas that consciously (& especially subconsciously) caused us to use & mask the pain are things we have to delve in to. Everyone has issues; some more than others, but knowing them is half the battle. When you piece together the ones at the root then you can begin attempting to let go. Patience is hard to have when you know instant gratification, but it‚Äôs needed when dealing with these larger issues.

My POV now is that these traumatic events happened & there‚Äôs no going back. The other problems that i may have caused that bring shame happened & there‚Äôs no going back either.... but we can begin making things right when we feel right. Even when we have to sludge through the work. We can all take charge now. 

Opiates, physiologically, not only brought us relief, but also gave us a stimulant type effect in our brains that we loved. Others get that from other substances while we got it from opiates. Giving ourselves & our bodies time to rework itself to baseline is the least we can & must do. Anyone can see the negatives outweigh the positives, but having balance allows one to see both. Day by day we move forward & that life will be a blip in time.

I know this is meaningless, but i wanted to write something out to possibly come back to as a reminder of this state i‚Äôm in at this moment. *Got to latch on to these things as they can sustain us during darker times.*

Hope all is well with you all. Take care of yourselves & the rest should follow suit. üñ§

but when i try to taper or even quit cold turkey my body is the most restless it‚Äôs ever felt, i just want to crawl out of my skin, my heart beats so fast i can‚Äôt sleep, and my anxiety is amplified. i want to stop so bad because this addiction is doing more harm than good but i used it as a way to cope with my mental disorders.

This last time detoxing has been like visiting the 7th level of hell. I had what felt like a second withdraw on day 9 and it seemed like I was ok but not ok. Then I have this crazy spiritual awakening of sorts. Basically every cell in my body painfully ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù over the course of 2 days. My eyes could see better, I could hear better. I felt like I was going insane. 

Then I felt awful again. At the same time, every breath is now deep into my groin and my entire core is just raw. The nerve endings in my arms are like frayed electric endings. I feel electric snaps in my head.I take it minute by minute just trying to breathe through it. I went and got a pedicure and just about jumped through the roof when the guy did a salt rub on my legs. Everything is overwhelming. 

I realize when I get emotional, these nerve endings and also my lungs and core vibrate more and I tend to get more overwhelmed. I‚Äôve recognized that it‚Äôs truly my feelings coming out all over the place. But at the same time, I am seriously concerned I‚Äôve permanently damaged my nerve endings.

I think it‚Äôs important to remember these moments. It helps our recovery stay strong.

My rock-bottom was having the opportunity to set my life up. I had enough money to get myself through Some kind of a trade school or even professional license doing some kind of thing. I could have even started a business. AND have money left over. Well, I pissed it all away on dope. And every dope run I made, I felt that guilt. But I couldn‚Äôt stop. The consequences of that was my rock bottom.

I went from having enough money to really start my life to sleeping in an inoperable car, unable to even have a morning coffee. I couldn‚Äôt even eat. I couldn‚Äôt even drive to a soup kitchen to get food. 

Then I overdosed and someone called the cops. The cops took my phone. They took me to the hospital with no shoes. Which I found funny because they took me to the hospital, supposedly for concerns about my health. Then when they found that I was fine and not going to overdose, they threw me out on the streets with no shoes even though before they put me on the ambulance I asked for my shoes and they said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need them where you are going‚Äù

Luckily, I had some cash in my pocket and if I didn‚Äôt I literally would‚Äôve had to walk for miles in the cold with no shoes. In the hospital would not have cared. I swear to God, the way our hospitals treat the homeless, indigent, and addicted is really disgusting and shameful and it just shows how broken our system is

But you know what? I put myself in all those situations. And this was a wake up call. It was the hardest few months of my life. I pretty much blew my chances add becoming anything successful. 

I‚Äôm in a much better place now. I have my own place, a car that works, and I am engaged. And I like to look back at those times as a reminder of where I used to be.

From my understanding they don't have access to it constantly so they were snorting their prescription kolonipin as a way to stop body detox between heroine doses. This person asked for help but refuses in inpatient detox due to a bad experience in their past. They also don't want to ask a doctor for help. From what I understood  if they have told the full truth their last heroine use was a little over 48 hours ago and they gave me the kolonopin to administer to them the correct way. I gave them their prescribed dose 12 hours ago and an additional dose over that 9 hours ago. Their plan was to taper the heroine use to stop the withdrawals. They said a full dose of the drug as they were using it before on the first day. A half dose as they were using it on the second day and then no more heroine use. To only use kolonipin for the last 5 days. I have been reading for the last 5 hours on this. And if I am understanding what I am reading if they take another dose of heroine at best they will be back at square one because the withdrawals start in 6 to 24 hours from a last dose and if they are not lieing their last dose was more than 48 hours ago. And at worst because they are taking the kolonipin the correct way now their tolerance to the heroine has decreased and could result in an overdose I they take the full dose they were used to. I am kind of all over the place with this. Hopefully someone will see this post in the next few hours and give me some advice.,1,0

I‚Äôve been battling an oxy problem on and off for a bit over a couple of years. I‚Äôve sporadically used in that time, probably about 60mg a day on average, but for the last couple of months it sky rocketed up to about 120mg a day, which is when I realised it needed to stop.

My withdrawal timeline looks something like this:

Day 1: nothing
Day 2: nothing
Day 3: 60mg at night 
Day 4: 40mg in morning
Day 5 nothing
Day 6 nothing
Day 7 nothing
Day 8: 35mg morning, 35mg night (70mg total)
Day 9: 30mg morning, nothing at night 
Day 10: nothing 

So, I‚Äôm just wondering what those two 1 and a bit days of use on day 8 and 9 would do to my withdrawal symptoms? Will it reset to day 1 or will it just set me back a day or two?

The past week I‚Äôve basically just felt like I‚Äôve had the flu, but otherwise I‚Äôve been fine - sleeping and eating as normal-ish, and my bowel movements have surprisingly been fine. Today I woke up and flu-like symptoms have pretty much subsided. I had 150mg of lyrica this morning, not long after I woke up, so that might be masking some of the other symptoms, but I feel like the fear of waking up with withdrawals is currently worse than the withdrawals themselves.

Any advice, info, words of wisdom, or just any help in general would be really appreciated.

Thank you :)",2,1

I‚Äôve kicked the dirty 30s earlier around may after about a 3month habit of either taking real percs or dirty 30s but the last month of that was mainly the dirty 30s I was up to about 3 30s a day before I quit cold turkey and with no assistance. I started again in July with dirty 30s taking 1-2 a day, and other days I would take real percs, the last 3 months though I have been only using the dirt 30s and i have been up to 5 a day for a short but the past week or 2 I‚Äôve tapered down to 2-3 dirty 30s a day.

What is weird though is maybe up until a month ago I have been able to get high at night say the last hit would‚Äôve been around 2am and would have no problems taking a suboxone the next night maybe like 8pm and not have precipitated withdraws.

About 2 weeks ago I took maybe 4 dirty 30s with my last hit being around 3-4am and I took the suboxone later that after noon roughly about 530pm and had the worst withdraws of my life. I had to take like 5 pills to not feel like dying and the withdraws lasted almost all day, they didn‚Äôt stop until I took the m30s(dirty 30)

My game plan to stopping is to continue tapering down this week and maybe start getting clean Monday. In the past adderal and Xanax have helped me not feel withdraws at all so I am planning on doing just that.

So the plan is wake up Monday take an adderal then work (I currently work from home) then sometime Monday night take a Xanax these are the 1mg blue footballs, I plan on doing this every day until about day 5 where I will pop the 8mg suboxone. I‚Äôm hoping this will help me avoid withdraws from going cold turkey and then by day 5 I would have waited long enough for the suboxone to not put me in precipitated with draws. 

I cannot go to the doctor to obtain clonadine or other comfort meds so please don‚Äôt. It is not an option at all.

What do you guys think? Should I wait longer than 5 days for the suboxone? I really don‚Äôt understand why it threw me in pwds the last time maybe because I had used more than the other times. Or do you think I should just go with the addy Xanax combo all the way through the 2 weeks. Again the past 3 months has been only the m30s, with a habit of up to 4-5a day until I started tapering down the past week. 

I also plan on getting kratom, and I have vitamin c tablets. Also there are pills called GABA at gnc, should I add those in?

Thanks guys any suggestions help, but please remember going to the dr. And ther Bernese method are not options so don‚Äôt put that on this post. Thanks

Update: I finally got paid so I‚Äôll be getting my adderal, xanax, kratom, weed pen, and cbd oil tomorrow before using my last bit and starting withdraws Saturday. Wish me luck!",3,0

Any help is appreciated.,"31 year old male here. First off, I did this to myself. I screwed up and accept that. My wife has been amazing helping me through this and idk where I would be without her.

About a month and a week ago I stopped taking clonazepam. I was taking it almost daily for 4 months. Anywhere between .5 and 2+ mgs a day. Irresponsibly. I had some acute withdrawal symptoms for about 2 weeks. It was terrible as im sure you all know. Extreme anxiety. I was crying before and at work every day until finally about two weeks in the symptoms started to reside.

Then, about 1 week later I decide to take alprazolam / Valium in conjunction with oxycodone almost daily for two weeks. The oxy was between 20 and 40mgs a day, snorting the majority of it. The alprazolam was between 1 and 2 mgs a day, Valium was anywhere between 20 and 40mgs a day.

This is where the shit hits the fan, but in a good way. I reached out to my parents and siblings saying I needed help. My dad convinced me to go to detox. My last day using was Friday, November 5th. I went into the detox program on Monday the 8th and got discharged on Thursday the 11th.

I take 10mgs of escitalopram daily and have for about 4 months now. The hospital has me on 300mg gabapentin and 10mg propranolol three times a day, daily as needed. This definitely helps, but im still getting elevated anxiety almost daily. Its very apparent when I get to work and throughout the day at work. 

I just need a breath of fresh air. Everytime I think the symptoms are good, I wake up with anxiety or it comes out of nowhere and drags me back down. Im struggling to get through work. My boss quit last week so my workload is almost two fold now to top it all off. Will these withdrawal symptoms compound with my previous use of clonazepam? I'm hoping it takes 2-3 weeks to reside since I only used these for 2 weeks on the nose. How long can I go taking gabapentin before I become somewhat dependant on that and need to ween off?

Any insight or thoughts on the above are much appreciated. Just struggling a bit right now.",5,0

Gag me.

My last day on Suboxone was October 26th of this year, three months after quitting an 18 month-long poppy seed tea habit (read: orally dosed morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids I had no way of measuring). These weeks have been rough and up and down, of course. But during the week leading up to my period and the first two days of my period, I was so sick and fatigued, having migraines every single day, and completely unable to function. Like, lucky if I got five minutes on my feet here and there before needing to collapse back into bed.

It's my third day into my period and I am doing better. The fatigue is still intense, but so far this morning I've been able to do more before having to lay down, and I can tell my mind and executive functioning in general are sharper.

I would really love to know if any of y'all with menstrual cycles while in recovery have experienced differences in the severity or variety of your withdrawal symptoms based on where you are in your cycle. I was the closest I've ever been to relapsing on PST during this horrific week, but thinking about having to titrate off Subs or ever do this again, plus plenty of loving support from family, has kept me from poisoning myself again. Research shows women are more likely to experience more severe withdrawal symptoms, different kinds of brain changes due to addiction, and a higher likelihood of relapse after shorter periods of sobriety compared to biological males.

Please please please share your experiences. Researching helped a bit, but I still feel pretty alone in this.",6,0

On one hand I‚Äôve dipped my toes in heroin and am self aware enough to know that isn‚Äôt what I should be doing, on the other hand my irrational monkey brain says I shouldn‚Äôt tell my primary care doctor and especially not my pain doc. 

I broke my back a few years back when I was 17 in a car accident and now 21 have grown a habit of buying tapentadol and tramadol ontop of my regular Hydrocodone and tramadol rx and now looking and have played with H.

I guess im looking to hear some reassurance that is based on experiences you all might have had or just what happened when you went to your pain doc and told them what‚Äôs up. 

I think I would really benefit from methadone but as far as my doc is concerned im on a relatively small dose of hydros (4x5mg per day plus two ER 100mg tram per day) so idk if he would buy into it even though the extras I‚Äôve grown accustomed to taking is something like 3-4 100 tapentadol which is equivalent to like 12-16 100mg tramadols onTOP of my RX

Any advice? Im also on Wellbutrin now which I think has been giving my rational brain more leverage so yea",1,0

I was given a blue had no idea what it was; my bf stayed up all night puking his guts out sick meanwhile I was on a cloud in heaven, we were drunk and didn‚Äôt know what we had taken (stupid I know) 
We broke up weeks later and I went back to that plug and started getting more n more blues, at first I would just do them 1/2 times a week after work if I was sore or wanted to relax, I was just popping a half at a time, then a full one; then doing them every day, then plug told me to smoke them to get a ‚Äúbest bang for my buck‚Äù and they ‚Äúwill last longer‚Äù false I started going through 10 a day smoking them and have tried so many times to quit. 
My question is, obviously that first 7 days sober is horrid physical withdrawal, my bones ache, my heart races, cold and covered in sweat, I spend all day in and out of hot baths until I‚Äôm out of hot water and crying about it. Even getting up to get a glass of water takes every ounce of my strength. I can‚Äôt eat can‚Äôt sleep, and the longest I‚Äôve gone is 8 days. 
But basically has horrible as that physical detox is, what‚Äôs even more dreadful to me is the mental / emotional anguish. I‚Äôm basically at the point where my tolerance is so high I no longer get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù at all from these I just feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô or not deathly sick. 
But I get so so depressed, horrible anxiety in every cell of my body which I have never felt before, everyone has always called me the happiest ball of sunshine they know, I‚Äôm annoyingly optimistic, so to go from being that person to literally having to convince myself not to kill myself every 30 seconds is so hard. I forget any feeling of pleasure / happiness I‚Äôve ever had and begin to hate everyone and thing around me and just want it all to end. All I can think about is ending the agony. The mental is so much more difficult to me then the physical. I try meditations, reading, I‚Äôve watched every video on Netflix. I had my mom babysit me for one of them because I didn‚Äôt trust myself, but everytime I convince myself that I just need to get a big bag and just end it. How do you push past the mental part? How long does it take to feel normal again? Mentally and physically?",2,0

I can only speak to this experience. Also this was not ‚Äúpain free‚Äù you will still kick but it ends 

Day 1: wake up OPMS shot plus 5 grams of a kratom I know actually works for me (many of the brands do nothing at all). repeat mid day and at night i took a shot plus probably 10 grams of K and slept 4 hours. Warning: I knew what kratom dosage I could handle and would work based on past experience. MUST start slow and figure out what works for your body. 

Day 2: cut the opms shots out. 5-7 grams kratom in the morning and 10 grams at night. I feel a lot of the withdrawals all day but it relaxes me enough to sleep 5 hours.¬†¬†10 mg loperamide when i start shitting

Day 3: no Kratom in the morning. this is when i feel like i need to let my body kick it out. 5.5 grams kratom around 10pm to sleep. 8 mg loperamide when i start shitting

Day 4: no Kratom in the morning, still kicking good but having a few hours of sleep at night gives me the strength to kick until 10pm when i take 3 grams Kratom and sleep for about 5-7 hours. cut out the loperamide for fear of it holding back my progress

day 5: still kicking but not nearly as bad as day 3. take 1.5 grams of kratom in bed witch calms my restless arms enough to sleep for 7 hours

Day 6: Not feeling the symptoms much during the day. at night i feel a little restless but no more kratom. I fall asleep on my own

Day 7 and 8: free

Like I said this worked for me based on a short relapse using less than half a g a day. Motivation for me is my family which I keep thinking about the entire time I kick and the fact that I wanted to kick before medical detox was necessary. This was very manageable with the quick Kratom taper. I have done this once before as well and knew that if I used the kratom correctly and stopped on day 5 or 6 it would be a useful tool. I must say that finding a kratom that actually does something is important, some of the caps do literally nothing. I also had off days1-3 took off friday and had sat and sunday. Monday was brutal but bearable. Day 5 I was fine at work, actually producing pretty well. It's day 8 and I do not feel 100% but it is nowhere near acute withdrawal. Threw out the rest of my kratom this morning.",5,0

Sorry this is mostly a benzo type of question but I treat all drugs the same, and I don't feel comfortable sharing in the benzo recovery so here we go..

Short rundown I basically have been addicted to xanax for about 3 years. I turned 17 last year and I started Od'ing like every month and going to extreme lengths to get the so called substances. I lost my business, two cars, my relationships with friends family and hurt a lot of people especially my mom and baby sister (not physically but I haven't been there for them and never spent time with them or helped in any way). So February 2021 came around about 9 months ago and I got a batch of busses that were fent/ and some Japanese analogs and it sent me into a two week blackout and before you know it I was overdosing immediately every night in my bathroom. One night around 10pm my mom put my sister to bed and she shortly woke up after. I have been basically just nodding out all day and said ""I'm sick and just going to sleep"" and my sister was crying and woke up and I must've took more before that and was seizing up and overdosing, I was stiff turning yellow and my eyes were fucked up and I was completely unresponsive. My mom came to check on me while she was coming upstairs and said goodnight hope you feel better and I didn't respond.. 

So next thing I'm in the hospital on a ventilator all sorts of fucked and I was there for a long 8 miserable days and the whole time was a blur but they were looking for a rehab for me that was reputable and wasn't just a week long hotel stay basically so I went to Illinois and spent 39 days at this place that actually helped me a lot!! I was able to detox pretty quickly and got in better shape and was feeling a lot better honestly!
So after 30 days they asked me about a recovery home close by and I kind of grew on the idea quickly, walked over there with my primary and it was beautiful and everyone there was amazing. So I was there and quickly got a long with everyone, especially this one girl.... so then I was super co dependant one thing happened to the next she gets kicked out and I'm still there. I got comfortable too quickly and wasn't working the steps I got lazy and didn't care so one day on my way home from work on the bus some dude left a bag and I peek inside and right on top a FULL SCRIPT OF ATIVAN!! Sounded great at the time lol

So I get back pop few sleep good and in a few days I run out. The was my first relapse like a week before my 18th birthday after about 5 months clean I felt shifty bc my parents drove 5 hours to come visit me for my bday and how proud they were for trying but don't feel too bad bc it's the way she goes sometimes. Had to throw a trailer park boys quote in there. So before you know it we're getting new kids and they're sneaking in xanax and gabapentin and suboxone and that point I knew I gave up on recovery fully. Before I atleast still cared about the program and all that but now I didn't give a damn. Couple months later I begin my transition home and get a job lined up before, got meetings planned out and it's going well for a week then I ran out of the medications they were pumping us full of and it messed my head up so I started going to my old script of different meds and drinking a little but atleast I'm free and home now right!? Nope.. 

My old friend has been in touch and he's tryna get me sum bars and percs and I'm like fuck it I've been wanting that. I guess I haven't done enough work at the recovery home but really fuck that place because it really wasn't all that great when we got new staff and clients it turned to a negative dope house. I'm just stuck I plan on buying 30 bars tommorow and I'm on probation and idk I know imma get them and I'm going to learn the hard way. But like going to meetings I don't have time for/not a lot of them where I live. My therapist sucks and I'm not on anything for my anxiety and I've been working like a maniac. I lost everything and the whole process of getting clean was almost traumatic and I want to get better but I want to do it with benzos and it's not possible.. I'm just looking for suggestions or anything like I said I'm not really willing to go to ANY LENGTH to get clean and I really lost motivation. I have a lot going for me in the next few months but at the same time it doesn't motivate me or make me happy like it used to. Thanks :) :/",2,1

I don't even know how to start this post, but with a face full of tears I will try my best. I guess, I can honestly say I've been fighting this Opiate addiction for over 10yrs. Started with norcos, until someone told me about norcos and somas so that started my love to nod. 

I came in contact with these pills as an additional way to make money. Using my insurance I was able to get a full prescription for both for  just $10. In return I stand the chance of making $1000 or more. It started out great,, but I wanted to know what was the big fuss behind these pills. BUT hey you know the saying ""NEVER GET HIGH ON YOUR OWN SUPPLY"". 

In the beginning, the norcos was an energy supplement, an Encourager, self-esteem builder a comforter during a very rough time in my life. A break up, two teenagers boys who decided they wanted to try out jail. Their decisions made me feel like a failure as a parent. That really broke my heart and I was so ashame. On top of that, I received the news my mom was in stage 4 cancer, I developed a serious case of the fuckits so norcos and somas was a great treatment for that.

Fast forward- after losting everything, my house, car, retirement, self-dignity and ditching all family/friends (due to shame) 4 rehab stays and an upgraded habit snorting Oxies 30s and taking subs in between the binges I'm still trying to shake this thing. I've learned how to master the physical w/d, but man the mental part takes me down at about day 10. My anxiety get to the point of random outbursts, hating people and me hating my life! Depression is another beast. I lack the motivation to even take care of daily hygienes. Right now, I'm working a job that requires me to travel so I'm away from all my dealers for 2weeks at time. I was having a friend mail me  shit but that became way too stressful so now I just wait until I'm back in the land of the pills... a 2 day binge and back to work I go with about 2 subs in my purse and some weed in my Checkin so I can function at work. 0

During this time, I've been able to save a little money, but I know the only thing that is allowing that is me being stuck in places where I don't know anyone. I'm ready to settle down and get my own place again but I'm so afraid of being broke again and losing it all due to dope.If I could learn to deal with the anxiety/depression and the fatigue I would be ok. I was thinking treatment again or even relocating for good to a different state which I've tried both before. Im so lost I don't know what to do. I feel like I've tried it all. Did I mention individual therapy because I've tried that too. 

You would think I would be happy considering I'm no longer using daily, but man i seem to be stuck in this fucked up cycle. 

People say find things that you enjoy, but tbh the only thing I ever enjoyed forreal was getting fucked up. It started with weed, to heavy drinking, to pills back to weed and whatever opiates I can get my hands on!.. I don't even know why I wrote this post at this point. suggestions I guess for energy, anxiety and depression would be great. Natural suggestions will be preferred.",8,0

Which would've been absolute hell as I thought about it and scared the shit out of myself lol. I decided some comfort meds will definitely help. I'm 30, in decent shape with no underlying health issues that I know of. So I know I can do it - but I hear gaba/Clonodine really help alot with the worst of withdrawals and figured I should atleast give myself a fighting chance. With nothing would be pure agony.

I remember when I did both my medical detoxs that Clonodine really helped take the edge off my anxiety. Don't remember if I was given gaba or not. But still, I'm hearing the Gabapentin, Clonodine mix really helps for the anxiety, RLS, muscle aches. Which I remember got me the worst.

Even though it is still going to suck, I know. I'm hoping that atleast I'll be able to be prescribed the comfort meds from QuickMD. I've heard mixed things, but most of em good. That people have gotten a bunch of different comfort meds through them, and many have even gotten subs (which I personally don't want.. PW PTSD y'know lol.) And if you don't, you get refunded.

Alway closely monitored by a doctor (i have a spinal disease which causes a tremendous amount of nerve pain and global neuropathy (not diabetic).  The use of the medication for me was to treat pain,  and only treat pain, I hate taking it.  My doctor and I worked out a plan early on so I wouldn't have to switch to a stronger opiate or opioid, and could control tolerance... at first it was an alternating of strengths; for 2 months 50mgx3/day + up to 6 30mg breakthrough (as needed) ... then for a month it would be 3x100mg/day with up to 4 30mg breakthrough as needed, but I've been onnthe 50mg ones now for over 3 years without an increase.   The drug is codiene  the 3x a day were codiene contin (long acting).  I hate this drug, I'm willing to try literally ANYTHING ELSE if I don't have to take it.   I made the decision on the 19th of October to omit the long acting crap...tossed them in the trash,  I didn't consult my gp...I just went for it.  I was ok-ish.  I saw my doctor on day 4 (at this point I had asked him the previous month to give me the same dose in IR but in 15mg pills instead of 30), so i was only using the 15mg pills and initially,  not watching my intake.  I had run low and was down from well over 300mg a day to just over 100.  I was in bad shape, the pain was insane, and I was tachycardic.   He was concerned I'd have a seizure.   We decided on a plan to use a medication used to treat nerve pain (not gabapentin), along with a fairly large dose of clonazepam to avoid the possibility of any seizure activity (I have epilepsy) .  I'm now down to 60mg a day, and have even had a 45mg day.  I wish my body and my mind would just agree that we hate this stupid shit.  My mind knows, my body gives me excessively exaggerated pain, which I know is a side effect of stopping,  it takes a toll physically.   Mentally, I'm strong and just want to get it over with, I'd rip the bandaid off if not for the epilepsy.   I've tried talking about this in the chronic pain sub, but they had a lot of hate for me saying that opiates and opioids don't have to be the answer.  I'm really struggling with just stopping them, it's not a high dose...but I'm terrified to have a seizure...i also hate taking the benzo...makes me eat like it's an obsession, literally until I feel like throwing up.  Thankfully,  my doctor said I can reduce the benzo on the 18th, and it does actually keep the physical withdrawal symptoms at bay.   Sorry, maybe this is the wrong place,  I just needed to vent, or see if anyone else was going through anything similar.   I've never taken these drugs to get high...if I take too many; I vomit...so theres no love there.  I just want to feel normal again.   I'm willing to accept the pain.",1,0

i have a roommate who did methadone and would try to temp me to take it even though i was clean from it i wanted nothing to do with any opiates r drugs for that matter well he tried to get me to take xanax and i refused cause  fear it kindling my paws back to square 1 and decided no

i take about 5 pills at night Vistaril lunesta and trazodone and he slipped me xanax last night in my 2 Vistaril capsules which i lay out every day in a cap to take for bed time it takes me awhile to sleep still due to paws and i went out like a light and was eating everything in sight which xanax makes some people do woke up 2 hours ago with that benzo like feeling and knew right away he slipped me

&#x200B;

he denied it up till i got dressed and said im going to the er to get tested then finally he broke down confessed saying that he hates seeing me so ""depressed"" all the time cause iv been sober last 10 months i freaked out because these last 10 months have been insanely miserable for me and i wake up everyday fighting tog et my brain back to normal tog et over these paws and to know that pos slipped me drugs that would re kindle my paws and set me back to zero.

 theres no way i could go through this process again before methadone i use to be a pro mma fighter and i wanted to get back to it again its the only thing that really helped me push through to this goal. i have no desire to wana use opiates or any drugs i dont even drink a beer out of fear of it messing with my brains recovery i just got back from the er and the doc said it shouldn't do anything to me but not sure if shes really qualified with the addict brain to know so im here asking if you think that the last 10 months were basically for nothing now and i have to start the process again with paws

Before I started taking the Roxy‚Äôs, I would occasionally take 5-10mg of Vicodin that I‚Äôd get from my home girl (2018 ish). I wouldn‚Äôt take the Vicodin everyday, it was only when I really needed it. Back when I was 17 years old, I got hit by a U-Haul truck which resulted in an open compound fracture to my left leg. I wasn‚Äôt able to walk for 6 months, completely bed ridden. I would take the Vicodin occasionally when I had chronic pain, but at that point I wasn‚Äôt abusing it. Maybe a couple times a year. 

Fast forward to about 2019. This is when things started to get out of hand. I started buying more of those Vicodin pills, which at that point I hadn‚Äôt touched roxy. My co-worked at the time had just gotten clean.  He used to be hooked on opiates as well, specifically fent patches and oxycodone, so we would bond over talking about opiates. That‚Äôs when he told me the Vicodin had a lot of Tylenol in them in and taking a bunch of them is bad for your liver/kidney. He told me if I could find Oxys I should take that instead. But he warned me to be careful because he said I will get hooked eventually. I didn‚Äôt believe him. I thought I could do it in ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù

I eventually found a plug for Roxy 15s (the footballs) in 2020 and I started buying 20 at a time. I‚Äôd only take one per day at that point. Eventually 20 led into 30. 30 led into 60. Then I was up to 2 a day. I found my tolerance was going up quickly. More recently it‚Äôs been about 4 Roxy‚Äôs a day with some oxy 10s on the side as an extra ‚Äúkick.‚Äù I found myself blowing through my stash rapidly which led me into running out before my plugs next script is available. 

I guess I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call a functioning addict. I still get my daily shit done. I don‚Äôt steal to get high or lie to family members. I am very open and honest with them. I am also very self aware.

If we‚Äôre being honest, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to quit just yet, but I feel like it‚Äôs something that needs to be done.  Before it really gets out of hand, I‚Äôd like to regain control of my life. I also can‚Äôt afford to keep spending $1200+ a month.

I managed to get some suboxone to help with the withdrawals. I‚Äôve only taken it twice before. The first time I took about 2mg. At first I felt fine, but then I got nauseous and threw up for 15 hours straight. It was one of the worst nights in my life. How much do you suggest I take without going overboard? I weigh about 120 lbs if that matters. I also realize that can be abused as well, but I only plan on using it until the physical withdrawals are over with. Any other suggestions to tackle the withdrawals? The hot/cold flashes at the same time is very uncomfortable. 

Happy to answer any questions! Thank you in advance üôèüèº",9,0

I have almost zero experience in getting professional help. Please help","The story doesn't really matter that much, I've been doing percs for about a year. Heavily for about 9 months. I've tried weening off but I always end up having a rough night and doing too much. So, I decided professional help made the most sense. I signed up for a treatment center, it's called PHP and requires me to drive 30 minutes everyday and spend 8 hours in a classroom, 5 days a week, plus 4 hours of evening lectures. They are unwilling to work around my schedule for college, even told me I will just have to figure it out, aka miss class. I'm not willing to do this for what they offer..   


So the treatment told me they won't be able to give me Suboxone anymore if I miss any of their lectures (I have 4, 8mg pills which they gave me that I'm holding onto for when withdrawals get intense). Is there a simpler way to get suboxone? Like just going to a psychiatrist? I truly feel like I can quit if I only had something to help with the initial withdrawals, maybe one to two weeks tops. I don't want to get hooked on them because I hear sub withdrawals are even worse than percs. This is my first time in any sort of treatment and this is honestly a pretty negative experience. It feels like they are holding the prescription hostage and they're very rude, condescending, and unaccommodating on top of that. I'm considering asking my Primary Care Provider if she can refill my prescription, but I've already seen her and she says she knows absolutely nothing about opiate withdrawals. I just figure it's worth a shot now that I have a prescription they've given me.   


Does anyone have any advice or experience with this? Will a psychiatrist possibly refill the prescription? Is that what I should try doing? Is 4 suboxone pills enough to just get through the restless legs/insomnia? I can deal with depression, cravings, and low energy, it's just the initial 4-5 days of agony I can't stand. This program I joined wasn't right for me and it was creating far more stress than helping. I would honestly rather do an inpatient detox than what they had to offer. Any advice or experience is appreciated. Thank you to anyone that responds.",1,0

I spent the night in a mental detox because things have been hectic, and when I got out my fianc√© messaged me about being in the hospital.  He was fucked up on fentanyl and knocked his teeth out and broke his nose. We got into a fight and I didn‚Äôt hear from him for hours and then I get a call this evening from an ER doctor saying he had accidentally overdosed and I rushed there, got in a minor wreck on the way, and couldn‚Äôt find him. He checked out right before I got there. I spend a few hours driving around looking for him and praying things are okay. 
I finally get a call from a detox center (idk if it‚Äôs like this everywhere but they cannot keep you in there, it‚Äôs voluntary only and you can leave whenever) and he told me his friend left him in a parking lot when he overdosed and someone saw him and called paramedics and thats when he went to the hospital. 
He went to detox afterwards voluntarily though. That‚Äôs a huge step and I have a great feeling. He was never heavy into anything other than dabs until the beginning of this year and it‚Äôs been hell since. I‚Äôm praying this is the end of the road and things can finally turn around. When he isn‚Äôt on drugs he‚Äôs the brightest, most incredible empathetic human I know and I‚Äôve never and could never love anyone as much as that person. I thought he was gone forever just to sink deeper into this hole. I‚Äôm elated he is at detox. I miss him and I‚Äôm lonely but I‚Äôm so beyond proud, I just had to share somewhere. 
He frequents this sub I believe, reading success stories, hoping to become one. Wish him luck. Today was the scariest day of both our lives, but I hope it‚Äôs the last bad day.",3,0

Now?,"I am writing this for a couple of reasons. I want to share my story with others who may be feeling as hopeless as I was a few weeks ago. I also want to just get it out of my mind and into writing.

I became a heroin addict at the age of 14. I stupidly THOUGHT I was in love with a man who was aged 24. He was a heroin addict. To my dismay at that time, he didn't mind I was only a 14 year old child. I just thought I was so grown up that he actually loved me. I now know he was a pedophile and he raped and abused me. Oh, and got me hooked on heroin. 

It began with me nagging him to try it. It didn't take much nagging. He gave me some to smoke one day. Then the next day. And the next. Then he decided it would be better for us to inject it as it saved money etc. I agreed reluctantly. I couldn't (still can not) inject myself. He would do this for me. He would often inject me with blunt needles. Caused abscesses and lumps and infections all over my 15 year old arms. I would BEG to just allow me to smoke my half. He would not allow it 

This went on until he would go to prison. Then I would cold turkey. I would be clean for the months he was in prison. I was lucky. I had good friends who welcomed me back into the group. I even had a good best mate who saw me through every detox. Anyway, then the nonse would come out of prison and I would be back on the heroin within a week. I tried many times to kill myself and almost succeeded twice. I would self harm. Not one doctor, police person or parent ever stopped this. I find that really hurtful. They all knew. The police knew as they would always see me with the pedophile, me looking thin and sickly. I would be there when they would arrest him. In the police station, I blew kisses to him in his cell in front of them, as he mouthed ""I love you"" through the little cell window. I told the hospital doctors and nurses why I tried to kill myself. It was over him and something he had done. They knew I was a 15 year old H addict as they treated me for my overdoses and detoxed me off heroin in hospital. And of course both my parents knew. My mother banned him from the house. She recently told me she DID phone the police several times to tell them about all this ..but they did nothing. This cycle went on for years. Until I was 18.

When I was 18, I met my husband. He was an ex heroin addict. He weaned me off heroin with Subutex that he was prescribed. He saved my life.

Sadly, two young junkies together sometimes doesn't exactly make a good recipe for staying clean. We both began using heroin together. Only ever smoked it though. I have not injected once since I finally left that pervert. But still... Smoking heroin isn't great is it?

So, my husband and I would have stints of being sober and then would relapse. This went on for 17 years.

This brings us to the present time.

I could not take anymore. About six months ago I finally reached out to professionals. I contacted my local clinic for help. I threw myself at their mercy.

The treatment took three months to begin. Those months were dark. I confess, I wanted to die everyday.

Treatment consisted of me visiting the local pharmacy/chemist each day. I would be given two 8mg buprenorphine pills. The pharmacist would observe me taking them with eagle eyes. Eyes that I felt were judging. That may or may not be true. But my mental health was so very poor then that I couldn't tell which way was up!

This clearly wasn't working for me. The pills? They were great! It was this daily visit to the chemist and this observation every single day that was making me worse than before!

I have to attend an appointment once a month at the clinic to monitor my progress. At each appointment I would cry and beg for the buvidal injection. I had heard ONLY good things about it. For those who do not know what it is, it's an injection once a month of buprenorphine that's slow release. You just have the injection. Have no withdrawals and get on with your life.

I was told no so many times. I was told it's impossible. They no longer give them out. The funding and availability is not there and so on.

About three weeks ago I finally got rock bottom. I wasn't going daily to the chemist. I was still using heroin. And I was still feeling like I wanted to die.

I went to my usual monthly appointment and I just broke down. I told my key worker that it's not working for me. I'll never be free. My life has been hell for 22 years and it won't stop. I don't want to die .. I just want the pain to stop. I took out my phone and said to my key worker ""I've heard of this buvidal injection"". She interrupted me and said ""oh I know what that is. Let me get the doctor"". The next bit happened so fast! The doctor came in, she said ""you MUST go to the chemist every single day for a whole week. Then, you come here on day seven and we give you a week's worth or the buvidal injection. Then a week later we'll give you the monthly buvidal injection"". Just like that! 

I was amazed! I thought it was ""impossible"" and there was ""no accessibility"" etc? Anyway! Never mind that! I'm finally getting it I thought.

I DRAGGED myself to that pharmacy each day for seven days. And I mean drag lol. One day I was forced to walk about five miles. But I did it. Because I knew this was my LAST chance for hope and change.

So... I did it. I got the weekly injection about three weeks ago. I admit, the first week wasn't perfect. But OMG! What a difference! No more waking up sick wanting to die. My mood was just lifted. I felt as though I had been living underneath a blanket made of black velvet crafted by the devil himself for 22 years. But now this blanket had been lifted off me!

I went two weeks ago for my second injection. This one lasts a month. The doctor even said if I feel withdrawals after three weeks I can go for a top up. So I have security. And NO MORE CHEMIST TRIPS!

The only problem I have now is my husband is getting his help. His first appointment is tomorrow! 

It's time to get my life back. If you read all that thank you. And if you're suffering right now, there's an answer out there somewhere for you too. I found my answer by asking loads of questions. Asking for other's experiences. Researching everything I could get my hands on. There IS an answer. There IS hope. It's really, really difficult to see this when you're in the throes of addiction. But you must fight! You can be well again. You can have a life. You are worthy and you're worth saving.

Now, i agree that he should stay longer, i have been telling him since he could contact me that he should take as long as he needs, but he tells me that he and his therapist have worked out a plan for him when he leaves: 

IOP, 90 meetings in 90 days, and living with his grandparents. 

I don‚Äôt know if i truly think its the best idea for him, but he sounds like he is really trying and making progress. I can‚Äôt tell him what to do though, so i‚Äôve just been saying that he should do what he thinks is best for him (Idk if thats good advice though).

My question here is what do you guys think is the best ‚Äúcomfort meds‚Äù easily available, and especially what works best for cold sweats/hot flashes. What helps regulate your temperature the best. Also, I am concerned of the possibility that seizures may occur from what I‚Äôve read on other threads, is this possible? If so how would you prevent this from happening? 

All advice is appreciated and I understand non of this is medical advice but I would like hear what worked thru ones self  experience.

I keep watching it even tho it‚Äôs triggering me, i think i watch it because i have my own theories and reasons as to why i know opioids became the number one killer in America, and im learning about how even drs got bribed or addicted to it too. I know from first hand talks to my friends who served, they were paid to bring the seeds back with them. My friend who tried to write a book about this was silenced and we still have 0 answers to what happened to him. But knowing that so many people got addicted the first time they tried it makes me so sad. I watched first hand as my mom struggled with this addiction & i still tried them & still got hooked. My first time trying oxys was me snorting it in my bedroom, and nodding off for hours and then going to school- still high from the night before. I only experienced the pills a couple of times & it wasnt til years later that i had gotten hooked on H, by accident. Yeah i know hard to believe but i was told it was molly by my ex who knew it was heroin and still told me it was molly. When i started vomiting and nodding off thats when he let it slip that maybe i did too much H.. i stayed away from opioids again for another 4-5 years & then i tried it knowingly what it was. But i believed i was stronger than that because id taken oxys and vicodins and percs and had been fine- a little sick but nothing some coke didnt help me get by with. I always thought i was just addicted to uppers til i tried that line and then did 10 bags that night & was almost dead . After a few hours i had been beggin my ex to help me idek what i could do to get off the floor & he stole my wallet and said he would be back & when he came back we did it all & it became an every day thing. I went down hill so fast that my own parents didnt see me for months. I just dont get how i could turn away from the pills but not the h? Has anyone else been able to do this?

And I can seriously recommend taking Effexor extended release, around 75 mg like two days in a row. It really helps with the lethargy. And on two occasions I took what I think was about 50-75 ug of acid while on pregabalin. It really changes the outlook on things. 

6 days into withdrawal I also had my third child(Im a father). I know how fucking iresponsible this sounds but I didnt have any other way to fix my way out of this one. 

I am nurse and on parental-leave for 21 more days so right now I can't hook myself up with any opioids which is great.

I pleaded with the cop at the scene to let me take him to get his methadone treatment and he acquiesced even though he blew a .08. There is a part of me that wishes they arrested him. 

Now, I'm between a rock and a hard place. I can honestly say, I have no idea what to do now. This is also a totally devastating financial issue in additional to an emotional one. I can't stop crying or puking. He is devastated, won't leave his room, and can't eat even if he wanted to, because his teeth are so fucked up, and he has a terrible toothache. I didn't believe him, and thought he was trying to get sympathy, until I saw how swollen his face is.    


This is the 4th time in 10 years that I've taken him back in, in an effort to help him.  Maybe that was a mistake, but he's my only kid.  I love him so much.

Sorry for another quick post but I went Cold Turkey from Gabapentin. I was taking 2,100mg a day. I ran out and I was too early for my prescription so I just stopped Cold Turkey. 

However, I‚Äôve felt nauseous all week. To the point I was almost sick, had those ‚Äúwatering jaws‚Äù (I call them) where you just salivate like crazy before you‚Äôre sick‚Ä¶. 

It‚Äôs a nightmare. I have went off food completely too. Apart from that, hot and cold flushes throughout the day and just a general feeling of unwell ness. 

I know it‚Äôs not an opiate however I‚Äôm hoping someone here has had experience with it. Is this normal for Gabapentin withdrawal? Or, could this be something else? 
I don‚Äôt want to go the doctor worried about nausea and appetite loss if it‚Äôs just withdrawal

For starters, I didn‚Äôt want to seem to be abjuring responsibility for the events that led to my prison sentence. What happened was tragic, and I admittedly played a role in what transpired, however well-intentioned and unthinking.

If I‚Äôm being honest, in a world where this post gained traction, I fear that the following criticism of certain powerful entities would be harm my employment prospects 5 years from now than my criminal history.

Firstly, some eye-opening stats (as best as I can recall): deaths due to opiod (esp. fentanyl) overdoses number 50,000+ every year, or the total number of U.S. casualties in the Vietnam War. The opiod epidemic has affected every strata of society; unlike previous drug epidemics (e.g. crack), one socioeconomic class or ethnicity hasnt suffered alone. No one has been immune.

During the Bush/Obama years, for the first time ever in this country, the life expectancy for an entire ethnic group *declined*; in an unenviable bit of white privilege, whites committed slow-motion suicide via drugs and drink for the first part of the 21st century. (The situation for the white working class was exceptionally dire). They were also committing suicide-suicide at higher rates than ever.

As anyone deep into the drug world during the 2010s can attest, opioid deaths, particularly due to fentanyl overdoses, were a ubiquitous feature of the scene. I knew of half a dozen or so victims (friends of friends, etc.) before I even started dabbling in opiates. When I progressed to dope, it was like every single user I knew had OD‚Äôed at least once from a fentanyl-laced pack. Even more shocking (in retrospect), no one batted an eye at this fatal fact, myself included; we jus kinda shrugged and accepted it as part of the bargain.

When I think of its unprecedented nature and staggering reach throughout society, the tragedy of fentanyl overdose deaths has become a (counter)cultural watermark for life in 2010s America, just like the acid trip and the expansion of consciousness was in the 60s.

The ongoing fentanyl epidemic in the U.S. is really a story in two parts.

The introduction of oxycontin domestically thru Purdue Pharma‚Äôs stunning duplicity is a commonly accepted origin point. But I think such a diagnosis is too facile. The American ruling class is truly the responsible party. They‚Äôve relentlessly shat on citizens by enacting policies catering to special interests and global corporations, squandered the advantages of being the lone superpower during the past 30 years far quicker than anyone imagined.

The second part of this story tells of a foreign adversary far more bloodthirsty than any cartel: communist China. 

But first, the cultural and political upheavals that that made the the U.S. populace susceptible to China‚Äôs predations.

Odd for a democracy, the American ruling class is largely composed of privileged individuals who loathe their constituents. Since the 90s, terrible trade deals, offshoring, globalisation, automation, and mass immigration resulted in a stagnant economy, (for the bottom 50%, it was moribund). There was little to no real wage growth for anyone not a corporate exec, and income inequality accelerated. (Trends that have reversed over the last 4 years.)

Americans then had their kids shipped overseas to fight wars in countries they never heard of; some came home maimed, many were shellshocked by their experience, and worse they didnt even know why. This convergence of events created for the existential dread Americans felt for the future; for the first time, they believed their kids would have a tougher life than they did. In a society that de-emphasized traditional structures like religion, they desperately needed emotional relief, courtesy of Big Pharma.

Egregious overprescribing remained common for most of the 2000s, and not jus painkillers, though. Every negative emotion suddenly found a pharmaceutical remedy. A case of the blues was reinterpreted as clinical depression. Kids with short-attention spans (I.e. kids) and lazy students were given low-grade meth. Anyone that went thru a hard breakup had a bottle of xannies to ameliorate anxiety. It‚Äôs crazy how easy it was to get a script for any narcotic in these halcyon days.

The sudden spike in overdose deaths from oxycontin (particularly the 80mg instant release formula) brought a slew of lawsuits and increased scrutiny, which caused the feds to overcorrect in prescribing guidelines. Law-abiding Americans who were denied their pain meds after years of use suddenly found themselves in the throes of withdrawal, strung out like any dope sick junkie.

They tried to get relief any way they could find it. For many, pills on the black market were much too expensive to maintain the habit they had developed under medical supervision. So they turned to the cheaper alternative: heroin.

However, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to overstate how deadly China‚Äôs intervention in this supply chain has been. A heroin epidemic is much different than an opiod epidemic. The margin between an active dose and a lethal one, already slim for heroin, is basically nonexistent for fentanyl. Meaning, the dose required to get high is nearly identical to the minimum dose that‚Äôll kill you.

Fentanyl is not new, and for a long time, it was marketed and known as China White, which it still is. In fact, I think it‚Äôs at the center of the criminal enterprise in that famous Bruce Lee movie. But new technologies and recent policy have granted China a de facto monoply on fentanyl; the dark web has made widespread distribution both feasible and profitable. It‚Äôd be more accurate to say China invented the modern fentanyl market.

Fentanyl is not jus responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths; it‚Äôs also made the dope game much more lucrative for any enterprising, unscrupulous dealer without cartel connections.

Browsing any darknet market reveals scores of wholesale fent vendors based in China, selling small quantities of a gram to large ones of a kilo. (Any other vendor of the opiod and its analogues are just middle-men between the Asian wholesalers and American buyers: they simply put a huge markup‚Äì like 200%‚Äìon the wholesale price in exchange for faster, more reliable, and trackable shipping options.)

Considering their draconian drug policy and surveillance state, this Chinese monopoly hasnt resulted due to the ambition of enterprising criminal cartels; it‚Äôs tacitly supported by the Chinese government and encouraged by the CCP‚Äôs hostility towards the West. Unlike, say, Colombian cocaine, the production of fentanyl does not rely upon local plantlife, and requires highly sophisticated laboratories.

In fact, (per wikipedia), fentanyl is nearly impossible to manufacture in an illicit lab because it‚Äôs a notoriously difficult compound to synthesize. In comparison, the production of LSD is easier by multiple factors.

The implication being: Chinese fentanyl production occurs in government- or government-sanctioned labs. In fact, until the last trade negotiation with the U.S., fentanyl was legal to manufacture in China, designated a commercial product, instead of a narcotic. If I remember right, it was this specific term to the new trade agreement that the Chinese reneged on, which provoked the U.S. during negotiations. 

In what is now a familiar pattern to anyone paying attention this past year, the Chinese government prohibited the sale of fentanyl domestically, while exporting death abroad. Chinese companies manufactured fentanyl, carfentanil, and other analogues with the tacit approval of the government, who classified it as some kind of consumer product rather than a pharmaceutical or narcotic. They then accessed a foreign customer base via dark web markets and sold it by the kilo thru these and other murky, illicit channels that utilized cryptocurrency for anonymity.

In short, the Chinese Communist Party is waging a sort of chemical warfare on the West by making readily available the most potent opiods known to man for pennies on the dollar.

A few years ago, you could find a kilo of fent going for a couple grand on the dark web, which is the kind of deal unscrupulous dealers salivate over. They could hit that 10 times over with cut and be left with a product still stronger than most street heroin, in a quantity with a street value of over a half million dollars.

If the U.S. were doing this to another country, there‚Äôd be social justice mobs condemning it as proof positive of our moral deficiency as a racist and imperialist society. 

And yet‚Ä¶on it goes, year after year, 50,000 dead, and it barely gets mentioned on a national stage. I think Trump is the first politician to have actually said the word ‚Äúfentanyl‚Äù aloud, let alone within the context of China.

What‚Äôs especially disconcerting is China‚Äôs brazen approach to this modern kind of chemical warfare. Theyre completely unapologetic about it; the legality of manufacturing fent is their worst kept secret. Their superpower aspirations find an outlet in causing cultural chaos in their main political rival.

But since dealers in the U.S. are the ones hitting their product with fentanyl, and American junkies love the potency, our leaders just shrug and never mention what‚Äôs happening.

I suspect this is partly China‚Äôs revenge upon the Anglo world for the Opium Wars a century or two ago. Britain‚Äôs unscrupulous business practices lead to widespread opium use among native Chinese, the country was essentially in thrall to the drug; it‚Äôs estimated this episode set China back generations.

But this has got me wondering, has the U.S. already ceded dominance to China? When the smoke clears from the pandemic and we can assess the facts soberly, will countries already value an alliance with China more than the U.S., which they see as a civilization in terminal decline? 

And when I consider my own role in this epidemic, more as an unthinking actor drowned by a cultural tidal wave, I try to remember how I even reached that point to be in that position. America has a bad habit of imprisoning its drug users; it‚Äôd probably be more productive to ask what lead them to use drugs so destructively.

That person in my PSI seems foreign to me now, but both Jeff and me were afforded the upbringing of the upper-middle class. With all that privilege, why‚Äôd we risk it for a Russian Roulette of a high? Perhaps more damning, what sort of society have we produced where a sizeable proportion of us have already considered the risk worth it, risking death in exchange for an hour or two of worry-free, pain free euphoria?

I've been hitting meetings every other day, focusing on myself, meditating, exercising, seeing my addiction counselor and therapist...just getting back to the life I had before I thought I could just support myself in recovery (false as we all know). My wife has commented how she loves my presence. 

Well... my wife has told me she wants a divorce several times but we are still behaving like a couple. Doing our trips together we had planned, holding hands, snuggling every night, telling each other we love each other, etc. She won't kiss me or anything intimate though she did kiss me yesterday (by accident she said). 

I can tell she still is crazy about me as I am about her. She's told me in the spring she's going to live with a friend (a friend we planned to move in with together) but that I could come eventually, after she had some space. Also said to me yesterday that if she didn't have kids by 35 (that's 20 months from now) I had to promise to give her kids. Also told me we would remarry if we were meant to be together. 

I know I need to focus on myself but I'm stuck between mourning the family I was about to have with her and feeling hopeful there's still a shot. I told her this, she said she understood it was unfair, but I also told her I knew she meant all that she said and she agreed.

I realize the pain is still fresh. Should I be taking space from this as to prevent further pain or should I be following my intuition which is that I know she wouldn't rather be with anyone else, even in al the pain? 

I'm trying to stay focused on myself right now because I need to do it all for me... but she is 100% the woman I want to be with. I've never met anyone like her and she has said the same about me. 

I realize this is relationship advice but I know a lot of you have been through similar. It's all very confusing... there's just not really a clear defined line of whether she's leaving or not even though she wants a divorce.

Appreciate you all and the wisdom we collectively have from this shared experience. Any reflection is appreciated. All love <3",1,0

Having some issues.","As the post title says, I was using codeine for almost two years due to injuries.In the last few months, I started using 4-6 pills a day (Paracetamol 500mg, Codeine 30mg.)My doctor said it was in her opinion it was time for me to stop using it and rely on physical therapy and alternate methods to treat my pain.

I wasn't able to taper down, I don't want to go into the reasons too much. But I went from an average of 4 pills to 1 per day for about five days then cold turkey.

The worst I've experienced were in those first few days were physical pain, shitting like no tomorrow and the sweats. That's all gotten a lot better, except having to go to the bathroom a lot.

But my anxiety and depression seems to be like a hair trigger right now, I can't focus on anything and I just feel hopeless. Today I slept as much as I could because I keep waking up and feeling like I haven't slept. And after that I felt pretty good, but then tonight, I just started to feel wildly anxious.

I am on antidepressants (lexapro 20mg) and regardless everything feels a solid 500% more than usual.

My mind usually sharp is just really dull, a different kind of dull to when I'd use.

I'm scared I'll replase and request another script from my doctor (she said she would give me another script after a suitable amount of time, if I found I wasn't able to tolerate the pain.)

Does anyone have coping strategies they can recommend?

I was prescribed 30mg oxy (10/325 TID) since about 2012 from an injury I sustained on the job. 

In 2019 I tapered myself down to 20mg taken in a single dose.

In 2020 I tapered myself down to 10mg taken in a single dose.

In 2021 my pain was getting worse and I started to read that opiates can in fact make pain worse \*\*\*spoiler alert\*\*\* the pain in my shoulders and back suddenly improved at the end of my taper. I decided after reading this to get off opiates...plus I feel like I have not made any memories since I started taking the opiates and missed out on my entire late 20's and early 30's...friggen wish I could go back in time...but I am sure everyone on this subreddit has that similar wish. 

As for the method of my taper

The scale I used was the KUBEI USB Rechargeable Digital Milligrams Scale 100g  x 0.001g on amazon...there's other scales that I tried, but this one  was the most accurate (consistently)...you just need to read about calibrating it and use the test weight each time to ensure it is reading right. I also used a 14 day pill organizer so I could cut them in advance - since it is a chore. I also found the Oval pills were the best  for breaking (can use your fingernails)...the circles were a nuisance. 

I was taking the oval 10mg oxy that weighed 530mg. I experimented throughout and discovered the following to be best (for me):

6mg/day from 10-7.5mg

4-5mg/day from 7.5-5mg

4mg/day from 5-2.5mg

3mg/day from 2.5-0mg

***These are based on the weight of the pill (530mg) and not the dose.

My experience was this:

I had no issues with the first 3/4 of the taper. I think it was around 2-3mg that I noticed I would get slightly anxious about an hour AFTER my dose and would feel unsettled for about an hour or so (nothing bad, just annoying). I think this, and the tedious task of cutting up the pills so precisely, changed taking a dose into a negative experience. Instead of wishing away my day until I could get into bed and take a dose, I began to wish the day could last longer so I wouldn't have to take my dose.

My shoulder/back pain started to diminish around 3-5mg and vanished around 2\~mg (minus the odd flare up from working out).

In the final 2-3 weeks of my taper I did notice that I was consistently waking up at 5am and getting only 6\~ hours of sleep a night...if I could get to bed earlier I would get more sleep, but my body's alarm clock was set to 5-5:30am (no matter if I went to bed at 9pm or 11pm).

My final dose was on Oct 30 (0.05g). My sleep was still iffy on Halloween, but has been completely restored the last 5 nights. The biggest thing is that my fitness tracker, which I have worn for years, has shown my ""deep sleep"" has gone from 20-45 minutes while on Oxy to about 60-120 minutes since my last dose.

My withdrawals were absolutely non-existent after my final dose. I have, and still do have, room clearing gas - that has earned me a bruised arm courtesy of my wife from ""hot boxing"" her under the covers. I had no real anxiety or any other physical symptoms - minus some anxiety waiting to pay my ""dues"". I do eat ultra healthy and weight-lift 5x/wk so that may have also helped. My energy was low during the last month from my low sleep, but has steadily been increasing...still waiting on the return of my libido..any day now would be great. The one odd thing is that I laugh more all of a sudden, I don't necessarily find myself feeling ""happier"", but the littlest thing will just have me laughing to tears...even when I shouldn't be...I feel another bruised arm may be in my future. 

The biggest thing for me with the slow taper is that by the time you are done you have no ""cravings"" and next to no ""withdrawals"". I do not even remember when I stopped feeling anything from my dose (somewhere between 3-5mg), but I do remember having negative reactions to it at the end. Instead of feeling worse after my final dose I feel ok, probably because with each of those little doses I was putting myself into minor WD, so the minute I stopped my body was better for it.

I just wanted to share my experience - since reading this subreddit gave me the strength to commit to this and see it through. I can only hope my experience will one day help someone as much as reading your experiences helped me.",5,0

341,2021-11-04 07:49:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/qmitjw/tapering/,Tapering,"Ive been struggling with opiate abuse where in the past year, I've dabbled with various kinds of heroin, oxy and fent. 

I was recently smoking 25mcg fent patches, one a day, and I realised that skyrocketed my tolerance. Then, I decided to stop since it didn't seem like I'd be able to taper from that. 

Why I chose to taper is because firstly, subutex/suboxone/methadone are all illegal and extremely difficult to find where I'm from even in the black markets. Secondly, I can't afford to WD due to certain daily commitments which demand full functionality. 

Hence, I decided to try dropping back down to a less powerful opiate, heroin, as the taper substance. In terms of consumption, I chase about 0.2g on foil a day. 

Oxy is also relatively hard to obtain here, the pharma ones occasionally pop up on the black markets but they're crazy expensive (a slab of 14 x 5mg Sandoz ones are around $150), which was why I picked H instead. 

Any advice or comments on this? I could obtain Codeine pretty easily, another option that crossed my mind was maybe jumping off into sobriety using it. (but I've taken up to 400mg of pure Codeine pills before and just felt kinda brain-foggy, I didn't feel much euphoria.)",1,0

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the best sub to ask this, but I figure who better than people who understand opiate addiction.
So I (34F) have been with my boyfriend (39M) for 2 years. One of those years he was clean, and he was everything I‚Äôve been looking for in a partner.
But he relapsed just over a year ago, and has been abusing fent. 
I have done everything in my wheelhouse to help this man. I have babysat him so he can‚Äôt pick up, drove him to detox (which he fled from instantly) and unconditionally loved him. But‚Ä¶he has lied so many times, stolen from me, he disappears for days. He even let it slip that the place he uses/picks up from is a females apartment (which adds a new type of worry for me)
Anyway, loving him this much is destroying me mentally and I need out of this relationship . I‚Äôve tried ultimatums but they end up with him promising me he will get clean, I believe him, and he does try, but ultimately goes back to using and that‚Äôs the cycle we have been on. It‚Äôs difficult to call him out on his using, and hold up my end of the ultimatum , because he will deny to the bitter end that he is using (even though it‚Äôs obvious) and make me feel guilty. 
I am holding on hope that he will get clean and we can restart, I just can‚Äôt do this when he‚Äôs like this, it‚Äôs too heartbreaking.
He begs me to stay and tells me he can‚Äôt get through this without my love. I know he‚Äôs struggling and that‚Äôs what makes this hard. So I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to end this in a way where he won‚Äôt take it so hard that he spirals. I‚Äôm almost thinking of just distancing myself as much as possible so it doesn‚Äôt feel like a huge ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù but is that cruel? If your partner has left you due to your addiction is there a way you wish they would have done it differently? Or even in a way that helped? He has nobody so I‚Äôm scared of walking away, but I think I have to. Just looking for some advice, and congrats to all you working on yourself and your sobriety!!",44,1

More than a month since I ""quit"". I put it in quotes cause I have still used sometimes different stuff, trying not to use the same shit regularly to avoid physical addiction.

It's not that I think I can keep it up or anything like that, it's just that most days are so fucking hard. Work days I'm so useless, I spend most of the time just staring at the screen feeling so tired and without motivation, barely surviving in the office until 5 p.m., thinking that without the drug I'm a useless fuck. 

Problem is that now that I've been thinking sober, I started to remember that I was like this way before addiction. It's not that the drug screwed me and now I'm useless, it's that I've always been like that.

Then I get home and I'm so tired that I feel like getting high to relax. Just a strong need to feel different.

Then the weekends I have no responsabilities to fail, so I should feel better. Instead I just get depressed and get the same need to use to do something. Been suffering from anxiety and depression.

So I've fallen into temptation plenty of times, trying to change the drug in question so as to try and prevent falling again into daily use. I see the same patterns of relapse that got me addicted again last time and yet I keep doing it cause I can't help it, life sober just seems like it makes me a useless fuck, which in turn gets me so depressed and scared for the future.

I'm trying to go to live in Canada which is my dream and it seems I have a good chance, and yet I can't just enjoy that while it happens. I know if I go I won't be able to get anything, but it won't happen for several months.

I appreciate all the knowledge and helpful posts. I have been following and reading for quite some time. I need to be done with this addiction/dependence. 

I am a 35 year old male. Been using pills for the past 8 years. I quit once for 8 months and used MAT- Suboxone

My question now is if anyone has any expertise in WD if tapering is done properly. 
I have tapered down from 120-125mg (Percocet) to 15mg (Percocet) daily. 

It‚Äôs been 8 months of a taper but I can‚Äôt seem to get the energy to get lower. I was thinking about Suboxone for a 5-7 days and then jump off. Or am I at a low dose and better to continue to taper and deal with whatever comes. 

Does the fact I‚Äôve been on for 8 years have a bearing on how bad the WD is or it strictly the amount you are taking. Or a combo of both. A friend of mine seems to think that because it is only 15mg I should be able to jump off with little issues.

379,2021-11-01 17:19:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/qko3zd/about_to_start_withdrawal_and_scared/,About to start withdrawal and scared,"Hi all, I am a chronic pain patient with a whole long list of problems that I don't see any point in getting into here. Whats relevant is that I have been on 60mg of opioids per day for the past (mscontin ER  and 10mg norco 3x/day)... oh, 6 or 7 years. My titration has only been raised once, probably 6 years ago and has been stable since. Occasionally I have taken an extra one day because of particularly severe symptoms, but then I reduce my dose on better days, so I have never asked for med refills early or anything like that. But I have felt creeping withdrawals, just never fully or for very long.

Anyway, so about an hour ago my dr office called to tell me that my doc's subscribing license has been suspended due to reasons they couldn't really get into. And he is a small clinic with no other physicians in house to take on his patients. 

My refill appt is in 2 days - so... Yup, I am close to out (so I don't have much hope for tapering). There is no time for making an appt elsewhere in time, and for that matter, where would I go? I have been with this doc for years. I mean, when a doc's license is suspended, do they ever get it back? It seems like the DEA is just out for blood these days, but maybe thats my fears talking.

I don't know what to do on that front. Obviously I will have to do something, but atm I am in a bit of shock tbh, so I am just trying to process the situation.

The one thing I do know is there is a very good chance I am going to be going cold turkey on my meds. Pretty much - tonight, so I can maybe save a few for desperately painful days, because seriously all I have is a few remaining.

So, yup, I am panicking a bit. I mean not full on panic attack, but I'd be lying if I said I am not feeling the fear.
I don't know what to expect from withdrawal except the obvious - more heightened pain from my usual pain generators. But what else I will go thru I don't know. So I am scared. After so many years, how long will I suffer these withdrawal symptoms (not counting my painful conditions)? Is this something that I can just suffer thru for a few days and then it will begin to improve? Or will I forever be haunted by opioids like they say it is for alcoholics?

I know 60mg/day is probably pretty low compared to many people, so please don't laugh at me. It feels like a high dose to me, which is why I have fought to keep it steady, despite some loss in efficacy. 

And of course, in todays climate of anti-opioids I know that going to another physician on such short notice will likely just make me look like a ""drug seeker"" no matter what I do or say. There is no doubt that I am fully dependent on these medications for my quality of life. And dependency and addiction are not so distinct from each other really. Which means that I am scared to even call other providers, because what if they tag me as a drug seeker? Chronic pain and illness carries enough stigma as it is, I don't need any more.

I don't know what to do. There are so many unknowns and what ifs, and thru it all I have to now try and navigate withdrawal at the same time with no one to turn to for help. I mean, I have seen some people use other substances to help with withdrawal and pain, but  I don't need/want to add any new dependencies. And would those make me fail a drug test, if my doc ever does get his license renewed? Its a balancing act to be a good little pain patient. I mean medical marijuana is something I have considered, but I have never tried it for obvious reasons. I've seen other methods listed here too, like Kratom (I think) but that seems like it might make matters worse long term. 

Anyway, thanks to anyone who reads this. Sorry to ramble. I could just use some support from people who have dealt with situations like this. I have so many questions, ongoing daily pain with about a hundred treatments I take advantage of besides rX, and now...withdrawal. I'm scared. And just really need to see a bit of light at the end of the proverbial tunnel.",2,0

Anyway, it's been hard for me to not shoot up my Rx of Suboxone. Bc of how gross it is to me. At first it wasn't too bad, but then I went back to shooting it for a month or so and the n/v has gotten so bad they switched me to zubsolv which does dissolve SO much faster. I am finding now that is even starting to make me vomit. 

As a result my levels have not been stable at all. I was supposed to get sublocade at the beginning of October. Then it was moved again and again. I have been going through withdrawals the entire month of October 2021 and have even taken time for short term disability (which I checked with my doctor about getting first and they magically just forgot about it so I haven't even gotten paid this month so I can't even afford my Suboxone or Zubsolv and they don't care) 

I want to shoot what I have SO bad just to stop sweating and feel better until I can get my sublocade, but idk if the menthol in zubsolv is safe to IV??? I know really none of it is ""safe,"" but you all know perfectly well what mean. 

The worst part about all of this has been the crippling depression and lack of motivation and care for anything. I have a hard time of letting go of the ambitious, overachiever I was b4 fentanyl. Now I am this lazy sack of crap that can't even get out of bed. 

My partner is going through the same program, but he can take Suboxone no problem. He thinks this is all in my head and that I am purposely trying to not take my meds. He thinks I'm a lazy sack of crap. No empathy whatsoever. I feel like my doctor only cares when I am right in front of them. Idk. I just feel so fucking isolated. 

This is my first time using, first time getting sober. I have no community. I am doing it from home with bf bc he has been through this, but I really feel like I probably should have joined a group or went to a clinic. Friends family and other medical providers can try to understand as best as they can as best as they want to but they will never know unless they go through it it is completely different because I was on the opposite side of that just over a year ago.

Hey guys, the Benzo community is kind of hit & miss and hasn't been supportive lately so I want to ask the experts and get some different advice! A little background so you know where i'm coming from with this, I'm 18, I'm 8 months off everything and the cravings have been really bad lately. My DOC was benzos but I did my share of opiates and stims. I am on my step-dads insurance Blue Care Network (BCBS Michigan) and I don't have a PCP or any of that. In therapy today she gave me 3 ""Family Medicine"" Doctors (Idk the differences) and I am going to call to see if they are accepting new patients. She recommended after I find one talk about doing GeneTesting to narrow down my results of medications to one maybe two that will work, because nothing has worked before (except recreational use) and she also asked me this ""Was your DOC opiates in the past? If so maybe Suboxone would be an option""?? I'm confused because I don't know the requirements to get Subs and how to ask a doctor or go about this in any way..

Please if you have advice on how to talk to a Doctor about medications please share, my anxiety is super bad I'm not sure if I should be honest about my past drug use, if maybe I should lie a little and tell them I'm still using opiates and i want to taper, etc etc..

This is my first reddit post sorry if this is too long I'll try and condense information when possible. Little background on me... I was in the Army from 2009-2013 and am an Afghanistan war veteran. I had never even done much more than drink and smoke weed (after I got out). But I recieved an injury and was put on Oxycontin because the Veterans Affairs deemed it serious enough to issue Oxy. I took it exactly how I was supposed to but time flew by and by the time they did check in with me they stopped me cold turkey!2014 had arrived and if having to stop cold turkey wasn't bad enough my mother is sent to Seattle for a heart problem. I flew with her there and had friends. While she was in the hospital I was hanging with friends who uses to live in Alaska. They immediately saw how I was and said 'Do you fuck around? Because you look like you are in withdrawal my guy' and I admitted I ended up getting hooked to Oxycontin. My friend said 'Well I could find you pills but H is just cheaper and easier to find here. Do you want that?' remember I said I had hardly ever done anything other than drinking and smoking weed I thought pills were safer at this point. I said 'No. I can't do heroin. I'm afraid of needles.' My friend she said 'Me too! I smoke off of tin foil.' Fast forward to today. First couple days after my last use I had Suboxone so I lucked out I thought. It's been seven fucking days and I still am hurtin pretty bad and I don't know what to do and am thinking of throwing in the fucking towel. If you are someone reading this do NOT EVER TRY HEROIN. NOT EVEN ONCE. I was somehow a functioning addict for a while then turned into a monster just to get this shit. Here where I live it doesn't flow as much as the lower 48 states.
