About 2.5 years ago, I went from 30 5mg Vicodin pills lasting me 4 months to where I was 11 days ago - 3-4 30mg M30 and 2-3 10mg Norcos every day. I started on the Oxy about 2 years ago - a friend gave me 60 5mg pills, and it was all pretty recreational early on. About a year ago, I started buying M30 pills from a friend, and TBH, I didn't even know what a pressie was until today, so I can't tell you what the hell he was selling me, but it would cost me a grand for about 80 pills. About 8 months ago I was at 1 10mg Norco/day and 1 30M/day to where I was 11 days ago - 2 10mg Norco and 2-4 30M per day. I realized I wasn't getting anything outta the 30Ms anymore so I quit cold turkey 11 days ago. In the last 5 days, I've taken 3 10mg Norcos. I have a script for 2 10mg Norcos a day for chronic back pain. 4 days after I quit the 30Ms I got a sore throat and all the other cold symtpoms (sinus pressure, diarrhea, coughing up phlem, super tired). I honestly thought it was just a cold, but now I wonder if it's WDS.  So I have a two part question - for you all that have been through something similar, what should I be prepared for? And the other question is I'm starting to think those 30M tabs weren't full on Oxy, so how will that play into all the WDS?  Someone posted on another site that these are definitely not pharma pills and most likely have fentanyl in them.  Thanks for any advice or support as I start my journey.",5,0
1,2021-06-29 16:33:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/oagoum/follow_me/,"""Follow me""","“Follow me.” you said. Anyone as lost, hurt and broken as I was could never have said anything but yes. What other options did I have? To suffer amongst the only flames I have ever felt that were not of my own creation? Yes, the first time I was in pain, I was metaphorically tied to the tracks of a train (and in a certain morbid kind of silver lining, at least back then I had someone, anyone else to blame.)

So in the burning ring of fire I found my own definition of existence. A troubled, dissonant and recklessly naïve state of being. I would have done, said, or been anything I needed to be to continue on the ebony (disguised to me as yellow) brick road to Oz. But that’s the ticket, isn’t it? Oz wasn’t even real himself. That’s the Goddamn theme of the whole entire story.

The theme to my own story? Well, at the moment it has been, still is, and seems it always will be suffering. Disheartening, crushingly martyring (yet I am the most selfish of martyrs, surely.) Martyrdom is usually a word saved for those who would give their life for causes with meaningful and mostly good intentions.

You never had any good intention though, did you? Not even for a minute.

I think that I used to, but then I gave you my social security number, my life savings and my sanity. Mother always told me to keep only that which is commendable close to me (but I have always been a rebel.)

Yes, I rebelled myself all the way down to the very gates of hell. “Follow me.” you said, and I rushed after you without abandon. Could anyone on this cursed teal and green sphere explain to me as if I were five years old… how could I trade infernos for such a priceless, pure gold?

I do not know. I do know though, that you will never, ever let me go. My spotty track record surely shows the chances of my palms slipping off of this trapeze rope my skin has chemically adhered to  (after all this time \[wasted\]) are infinitesimal, quite, quite, oh so very low.

Instead I think I will take up masonry, and lay a concrete wall in between the part of you that can touch me, torch,warp my own personality, wishes, wants and dreams.

By all means do as many push-ups as you please. Jumping jacks and burpees, all day every day.

But I promise as if my very soul depends upon it (which truthfully, it does) that you will be trapped in the cement. You cannot train hard enough to break it, to break me, ever, ever again. That is, unless I allow you the privilege of destruction, implosion. 

I do hope you suffocate one day though. I am not above wishing death on those and that which has only ever sent me to the precipice of the very same fate.",3,0

He was sitting on a wall and nodding off, pretty obvious he was on H Or pills.  It hit me pretty hard for some reason, it was kind of like a glimpse at my past self or what would have been my future had I not gotten help.  I really felt for this dude and felt like I should help but couldn't think of how.  I knew I wasn't going to clean him up and that wasn't the help I was thinking of, more like it was hot af out and he needed to get out of there.  As I'm sitting there thinking it through I see a lady pull up and quite obviously call the cops on him.  I'm like shit man this dude doesn't need jail, he needs help or at least to be somewhere safe for a bit.  

Sure enough, cops pull up, and arrest him.  I'm felling all kinds of ways about it and I can't really process what it is.

I can’t find anything on Reddit that I care to read for longer than 5 seconds, no shows that I want to watch. The day is just sooo long when I’m going minute by minute, but there’s nothing that I seem to want to do!

I went willingly, it's not like they forced me to go or anything. They did everything for me. I stayed for three whole days which is a lot longer than any of my previous attempts. They sacrificed so much for me and just did every last thing they could to make me comfortable and feel safe and everything, but I ended up just leaving anyways bc I'm a piece of shiiiittttttt. Idk. I honestly just wanted to go home more than anything. I wanted to do it at home from the start. It was sprung on me last second that they wanted me to come home with them. I had zero warning. They actually came over under the pretense of just hanging out and being there to support me since they know what I'm going through with wanting to quit so bad, but feeling helpless about it. Little did I know, they actually came over to try and convince me to go back with them. And I didnt find this out until they said it to my parents in front of me...and then once they did, THE VERY SECOND I said ""yes, I'm willing to give it a shot, BUT, I would at least like to hang out for a little while and just relax at home and not have to leave right this second,"" despite my friend saying ""of course you can,"" they just immediately started packing FOR ME, without me, and had her husband come pick us up right that moment. Also, you know....I get that addicts lie and manipulate, obviously, but not every addict does that, and I do not do that. I mean, I have, who hasn't, but for the most part, I am so fucking honest with people about my addiction, because I just genuinely want help!! However...my friend, who was honestly being way too aggressive about all of this, actually told me that she ""has to assume that every word coming out of my mouth is a lie."" Which, first of all, I wasnt even trying to get anybody to do anything, I was literally just attempting to explain some aspects of how my mind works as an addict, etc. Shit like that. But instead of just fucking listening to me, or even just listening to me and still thinking I'm lying or whatever, like maybe at least dont say that to my face when I'm trying to pour my heart out to you about ny struggles with addiction...

Sorry I guess this is more me venting than asking any specific question. Idk what to do now. I already left. All my shit is still over there. I'm sure I probably just lost some friends over this. I'm sick of that, but at the same time, you cant expect to just take control of a whole person's life for them. And if you DO, then you AT LEAST have to fucking work WITH them. 

It's like every time I ask for help and somebody is actually willing to help, but doesnt understand how hard it is to not relapse or fail entirely at detoxing, they always just get mad at me and I lose a friend for it. I feel so trapped. I feel like I cant do anything because every time I try, I just fail. I feel like i should be proud of myself for even trying at all as opposed to just continuing to use, but this shit is fucking hard and it's probably going to take a few tries. It wont happen overnight. But people dont seem to get that and just think I'm purposely saying fuck it and giving up or something. Its not like that. I want help so bad. I just want to be done with this shit. 

Sorry for being long, thank you for reading if anybody does. It just helps to get this out.",26,0

Currently coming off what used to be a 250g habit of poppy tea, strong, that I used consistently for 4-5 months. Over the last month, I tapered down to 60g before switching to weak old seeds for a few days because I was scared but I refused to order more. 

Then I just went for it. 

I started my loperamide taper on Day 2 when withdrawals became too much. I took two Tagamet and, so as not to overshoot, I ratcheted up the loperamide only 6mg at a time. I settled at 24mg. It seemed to help. 

The last few days however, the loperamide seems to be making me even sicker. Within an hour of taking it I get clammy and sweaty and a gnarly headache and stomachache and all I wanted to do is lay there. So... I would lay down, get fitful rest or feel crappy, and then around 12 hours after loperamide the morning would come and I’d take my supplements. 

At that point I’d start to feel good. Quite good. Not in a high way, because the anxiety is immense. Regardless, I’ve begun to notice how intense colors and textures are. I can hear the birds. Things are funny again! Honestly it’s beautiful. I feel like I’ve been seeing the world in tunnel vision for the last five months and now the scope of my vision has widened out. I’ve been exercising and spending as much time outside as I can. 

Due to the exacerbated issues with the lope, I tried **not** taking it today.  And although I felt withdrawals coming on, it was notably less shitty. I decided to abandon ship on the loperamide and switching to a Kratom taper. 

All of this is odd to me. I assumed I shouldn’t be at this “pink cloud” point in the mornings for another few days to a week, especially with being on the loperamide. But now, 20 minutes after taking the first dose of Kratom (super low, 2g), I noticed the texture and color start disappearing again and I hate it. I just want to be me again. 

What gives? Why didn’t I experience this “opioid-grey” on lope? 

It’s possible the lope was interacting with my huge supplement regime but I don’t want to try it again.  Lope is gross. 

Any insight? 

**Supplements and meds:**

AM: 
* loperamide 24/22/20mg (taper)
* Tagamet 400mg
* Cymbalta 60mg (prescribed)
* Dextroamphetamine 10mg (prescribed) 

PM:
* one-a-day women’s multivitamin 
* D-L Phenylalanine 500mg
* Black Seed Oil 2g
* Boron 3mg 
* Hyarulonic Acid 400mg
* Probiotics

So I (31F) dated this guy (37M) back in our early 20s. We partied together and were very much in puppy love. While I went the family route and had a couple kids, unfortunately he went down the hole of addiction. Fast forward about 10 years and we meet up and well...fell in love all over again. He was struggling with his addiction when we first met again but with the help of Suboxone stayed sober for over a year, things were great until he relapsed (this was 6 months ago)... I tried to help him but to no avail. He is an IV fent user and is so far gone at this point, and there has just been so much lying and manipulation. I’m devastated. My kids and I all really love this man. So my question is, have any of you sabotaged a relationship while you were in active addiction and were you able to mend it? Do I need to forget this guy and move on? I would love to hear your stories. And congrats on all you who are in recovery!!",20,0

I got clean about couple weeks ago. Starting to feel normal. Still do Kratom here and there for energy but thats it. No more Fent. 
Im just writing this post so maybe it can help someone. 
I knew that if I had access to my money, I will use it all on my addiction. i was doing that. 
I didnt want to end up homeless or have my wife and son end up homeless. So what I did was took my name off our joint account. My paychecks were still coming there. I told my wife no matter what, do not let me add my name on there again. I supported my habit by doing door dash part time after work and on weekends. My wife kept saving our money after bills and stuff. Now we just bought our first home together. She managed to save enough with both of our paychecks that we were able to put $150k down payment on a $500k house. im very proud of her. she is very good with money. 
I don’t do doordash anymore because i quit fent couple of weeks ago. It was hell first 5 days, but got better. 
Now that I look back, removing myself from access to our account was the best thing I did. Because if i didn’t, we will be broke. I knew that if I was going to do Fent, i will have to work part time job to support my habit. This way, my money from my main job and my wife’s paychecks were going towards bills and saving. There were a lot of times i regretted taking my name off account, because i would be so tired from working all day, and then I would have to go do my part time job. A lot of times i told her to add my name back. But she didn’t and im glad. 
Once I make couple of months clean, we will add my name back on account. 
If anyone of you want to save, give access to your money to wife or parents or someone you trust. and support your habit by having to work part time job. I got so tired of not having any days off because i would work all day on weekends doing doordash, i finally decided to quit.

My addiction grew from a monthly doctors script for 30- 5mg Percocet, to 100- 10mg oxy, to buying blue Mexican 30s (which we all know are fentanyl) from a dealer and easily using 25 a day. My husband is the same, doctors script to Mexican oxy, and we use the same amount. Our method of consumption was sniffing them, and doing it around every hour, eventually 2 at a time. I was getting ready to check into detox and dreading it, We’re parents, We have children and can’t just leave, so this wasn’t a very good option for us. ENTER vitaminC megadosing! Nobody was more skeptical than me! I did it purely to prove to my friend that it wouldn’t work, what a joke… vitaminC? Seriously? I felt like she just didn’t get it. We weaned down as far as we could without feeling like dying, which was 7-10 pills a day, and bought a bottle of powdered sodium ascorbate (this is preferable to ascorbic acid) for $20 (the price of 5 pills I thought…) and I put 1/4tsp into each of 10-8oz water bottles, filled them the rest of the way with diluted fruit juice. 
Day 1 I drank 12 bottles, (15g vitC) used 3 blue pills, 
Day 2 drank 16 bottles  (20g vitC) 
Used 3 blue pills
Day 3 I added 1/2tsp this time to the bottles and drank 10 bottles.  (25g vitC) 
Used 2 blue pills in 8 pieces
Day 4 drank 12 bottles (30g vitC) 
Used 1 blue pill cut into 4 pieces.
Day 5 this is where I am now, I have not had any oxy, I feel great, I plan to drink 25g vitC, and taper to 20g tomorrow, to 15g, to 10g, and then whatever, I’ll feel it out. I basically have no physical cravings, and nearly NO withdrawal symptoms, besides the mental and emotional urge, which is honestly not doing me in, it’s manageable.

I actually found the process pretty painless. Mild discomfort in my stomach. Sweats and chills. Completely manageable tho. No RLS or trouble sleeping. Work wasn’t a blast but it was doable. I ended up giving in on the third day tho because I missed feeling nothing.

I took the methadone all three days. But I ended up using about a point on that third day. That was the day before yesterday. Yesterday and today I didn’t take methadone, assuming I screwed things up. 

Just wondering how long I should wait before attempting it again. I wanna make sure the methadone tolerance is reset back to zero so that the taper works properly.",5,0

Posting today to let you know we are running a smart meeting in the RedditInRecovery discord! It happens every friday at 9pm central.

If you've ever thought that you need a meeting but you were scared to go in person, or you went to 12 step and it didn't fit with your mindset... I encourage you to check it out.

Here's a quick writeup of the program and how the meetings go: SMART (Self-Management And Recovery Training) Recovery

SMART is a generalized non-spiritual/non-religious addiction recovery program that is self-driven, as opposed to standard 12-step style programs, built from science-backed psycho-therapeutic techniques (e.g. CBT/DBT/REBT) that are applied in the context of addiction.

The focus is to help and empower participants by building sensible mental tools as part of their recovery to overcome the logical fallacies, difficulties in emotional regulation and other mental roadblocks that appear during the path to recovery, no matter what stage someone is at (day 1 or day 1000).

The SMART approach is built around ""the 4-point program"":

Building and maintaining the motivation to change.
Coping with urges to use.
Managing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in an effective way without addictive behaviors.
Living a balanced, positive, and healthy life.

Meetings

SMART meetings are best understood by looking at the meeting format. Unlike other programs, cross-talk (discussion between participants) is encouraged.

The meeting opens with a check-in where everyone one-by-one is invited to speak about how they are today, where they currently are in their recovery, any stressors they'd like to work on and anything else that feels relevant in the present.

The facilitator will ask people who are dealing with an issue to discuss it, generally inviting other participants to chime in if they have relevant experience or some thoughts, then work with the current person on teaching them (as well as the group as a whole) a tool that is applicable.

The meeting closes with a check out in a similar style to the check-in, where feedback is given to facilitator as well as simple how you feel and anything that may have come up that you want to ask about.

If you'd like to join us for the meeting tonight just click this link >> https://discord.gg/S3gEqnFw

I will be 3 years clean in october from various narcotics and I really cannot speak highly enough about how much the tools in smart helped me deal with intense urges and cravings along the way.

Hope to see you there!",4,0

If anyone has been following my posts I came back from detoxing of a relapse at my sister for 2 weeks. Did well there. Came back to grans and started doing weed every night. I’ve had two relapses both with small amounts of endone. Both were shit. And that’s what scares me. I can no longer take the pills and escape to fantasy in my head because I’m now so rooted in reality. And I know that sounds like a good thing but I’m actually grieving the loss of a terrible coping mechanism. And I know that’s normal as this was something that was helping me ‘survive’ in a way but it’s not working anymore. Gods the lies we addicts tell ourselves. I keep thinking just one more really good high and I’ll be done. But there’s nothing there. I’m not getting anything out of it anymore and that angers me and scares me. I’m gonna try tonight first night back here and sober tonight. I have to try. Gotta keep fighting. But I’m so scared of being lone with my head. My childhood was horrific and I have been very isolated and the ptsd in me is awful. I am completely griped with panic and trying to work through it is so hard. I’ve overcome some horrific things like borderline personality disorder and a severe anxiety disorder. Worked so hard with therapy to heal but rebuilding my life while everyone moved on with theirs….it’s so lonley. I discovered with my psychologist that my fantasies while high are just normal wants and desires. I fantasies about romance and friendships all things that I was put down and mocked for wanting when I was younger. I was not allowed to express my desire for basic needs and wants without ridicule. Was so pathetic I made my pscologist cry. There is so much to work through and I’m so scared and tired. I’m gonna try though it’s all I can do. I’m gonna start posting often to keep myself accountable but I just needed to get this off my chest. I need to start living life again,0,0

My addiction story begins a little over 20 years ago. I was a child. At 13 years of age, I was groomed by a heroin addict. He said he loves me. He said we were a couple. And then he started injecting me with heroin. This is not relevant to addiction, but he was also raping me. (Rape meaning he was having sex with me when I was 14 and he was 21).


It all began with smoking heroin. He would steal from stores and sell on the goods to feed our habit. He went to jail for this roughly three times in total. Each time he went to prison, my mother would nurse me through a brutal withdrawal. And because I was so young and also because I was injecting, it made the withdrawals really hard! Now don't get me wrong withdrawals are difficult no matter what! But withdrawals in 8 minor or very significant indeed and I was hospitalized on two occasions.


This went on until I was 18. But then, I had began to develop a severe phobia of needles. This is probably because he  used to obliterate my arms and wings and butter until I had welts and abscesses. He would use very burnt syringes on me and he would also be falling asleep and loading out while he was injecting me when the needle was in my arm! All this while I am in withdrawls! I would beg him Everytime we got heroin 2 please allow me to smoke my half of the bag. But I think he desperately wanted me hooked on the needle and hooked on the need for him because he would not let me smoke it no matter what happened. One time a friend of his witness me arguing with him and begging him for me to be allowed to smoke it and the friend heard him telling me know I have to inject it. The friend was absolutely dumbfounded and questioned him on why he wouldn't allow me to smoke it. And like spoiled kid he said one word only but in an extremely childish and annoying voice: ""Nooo"" (imagine a baby saying this if you refuse to buy the child a toy or sweets. Thay was how he would react if I wanted to smoke it.


Fast forward now, four years. The pedophile is in prison again for shoplifting. I made it through three days of cold turkey. Then I finally snapped!


I went alone looking to cop. I run into a man I vaguely recognized. I wasn't even sure it this man was an addict. I took my chancel. I asked him if he knew of anyone who was selling any H.. I explained that if he could score for me, I would reward him with a bag of H for free. Well, that worked.! Lol.


A time goes on me and C get into a real romantic and long-term and proper relationship with one another. I stopped injecting the day I got away from the paedophile. I haven't considered doing that ever again. I am traumatised from my younger years when I was forced into getting injected several timetable from someone who is extremely tired and selfish and irresponsible. 


At 18 I met my husband. He was also a user. He only ever smoked it and he certainly never robbed or shoplifted for money for drugs. He had a prescription for Subutex and would give me half. This dose was apparently too low. We were using H on top!


Then, something has happened! Almost 17 years later around two weeks ago my husband subs were rapidly stopped. And we were both left to withdraw without any treatment at all.


My addiction got so out-of-control that I finally found some help from my NHS (national health Service); drug and alcohol treatment facilitator. 


I rang them up to book my preliminary hearing around 3 months ago.


My first meeting was to take urine samples and discuss my addiction.


My second appointment was blood tests and another urine sample. And two weeks ago I had an ECG. 


All my test brilliant and warranted no further treatment so I was then good to go to get my own subutex prescription.


Today was my first meeting with the actual addiction doctor. I was truthful with her about everything and she was very nice indeed.


Today I start on my Subutex induction! They will start me on 8mg today then 8 MG on Saturday and Sunday and Monday. On Monday then return to the doctor and she will ask me if I am comfortable and ok on the 8mg. Of course I don't know the answer to that yet but I will buy Monday anyway. 


After they have found the correct dosage for me I will be giving the people often injection once every three months.


And very very pleased and happy that I finally have a treatment plan in order and I finally have a new lease on life because I know I am going to be better now!


Thank you if you got to the end of this post I know it was long. 


I just want anyone who is reading this to know that if you are struggling with addiction please seek medical help! 


I now finally have optimism about my future and my recovery.

I drink 4 glasses of oj and eat cantaloupe, pineapple, and oranges every meal. Took kratom 4 kratom pills 3 times a day for 2 days. Now just vitamin c overload and muscle relaxers for pain/stomach cramps.

After a 20 plus year struggle with opiates, I really believe I’m on the path to being finally free of it (in my opinion, if you go 5 years with no relapse or slip you can consider yourself fully clean). I microdose psilocybin mushrooms and LSD and I truly believe that it was the key to getting clean. Yeah, some virtue signaling folks will point out “but you’re still using”, which is why I never went to NA...always seemed like a bunch of judgemental ppl who had nothing else in their lives BESIDES NA meetings, arguing over who is “cleaner”...definitely not my scene. There are no rules to being clean and Microdosing isn’t “getting high”...It made something click in my head and I finally “got it”. Microdosing helped me deal with the TRAUMA not the drug use, which I believe is at the core of all addiction. It unlocked the doors that held all I needed to get to behind it. I started a thriving microdose supply/guide business that is so rewarding and fulfilling, I’m still rocking with my band, still having a blast and experiencing things with a new outlook for the first time. I’m FEELING life again. I’m in touch with me again. My life is rocketing upwards and there’s no stopping me

This is my second time attempting to quit Heroin.

First time I quit I was put forcefully into a detox / mental facility. (My whole stay there was 10 days). Their treatment program was focused entirely on filling me up with as much medications on the daily as possible. I would have to shove in 7 pills in the morning and another 8 at night or else no food for the day. Some of them were 

Leponex (clozapine) 100mg.
Efexor* XR (venlafaxine) 75mg.
Depakine CHRONO 500mg.
Remeron (Mitrazapine) 30mg.
Halonace (Haloperidol) 5mg.

I actually found out that one of them is an SSRI and another is an SSRNI which when taken together can cause seratonin syndrome. 

 So I decided to stop taking them cold turkey after I got out of detox. that's when the anxiety started happening so I relapsed and quit this time with the help of Gabapentin and Lyrica which I hear have aqute side effects as well. 

Now I can't take the stress of anything and even the mildest things can very easily send me into a full on panic attack. Getting out of bed in the morning is hell. I get the most extreme mood swings mid conversation, as in one second I'm smiling and the other I'm seriously contemplating suicide.

I wish that evil drug never existed. I constantly feel that voice in my head telling me no matter what you accomplish nothing will give you true happiness like Heroin did. And it's honestly the most fucked up thing about addiction. 

I wish someone told my dumbass 16 year old me thinking I can dabble and quit any day about this lingering never ending thought that tore away my soul, hopes and dreams. 

It's like I can be a multimillionaire who has everything anyone could wish for and I still be not happy unless I'm on that shit.

Sorry I rambled. What do I do about the anxiety ? Should I get back on the antidepressants or is it just PAWS, please help?",4,0

I’m now a month and a half off the subs and feeling pretty good. Mentally have been feeling strong. But then an old acquaintance with a script found me on facebook and sent me a message saying they needed money and wanted to sell a few. I replied and said “No thanks” but now I just keep dwelling on it. I’ve come up with a bunch of scenarios about how I would go get it. I keep having thoughts like “Now that I’ve been clean I would actually be able to get high on one 30.” But the problem is that I know it would never stop with one 30… Maybe today it would, but next week I’d want another, etc etc.

This is sort of a pointless ramble I just needed to get it out there. I’m still wrestling with myself a little bit and it’s been hours.

I have basically just been relapsing once a month, for 1-2 days at a time. I have been having constant heart palpitations. I last used suboxone on May 28th for approximately 3 days but i snorted like 4 8mg pills a day during that time. 

This entire month i’ve had heart palpitations basically from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed. I did a couple 10mg oxys on june 12th but haven’t touched anything since. I have noticed in the past that opiates were causing me to have these heart palpitations but they usually would go away after being clean for 5-6 days. 

They have never lasted this long after being clean. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, when did they go away? I’ve been to a cardiologist and had a completely work up of my heart and he says they are PVCs and nothing is wrong with my heart. 

I know that opiates mess with the hearts electrical rhythm, i guess i’m just looking for some reassurance that my heart will go back to normal and if anyone else has experienced anything like this.",3,0

All negative influences in my life are out, the constant day breakers are gone. Nothing worth a fuck, comes easy. I had to fight friends, family, and the state.

I loved opiates, and might still. But I love having control of my life way more. If I'm broke now, it is because I've recently bought a new toy for me or my people. Not because I'm funding a habit and supporting some shithead of a dealer.

This is way too easy to go long winded on, but I went from nothing to having vehicles/motorcycles/property in this same time period. I worked, I grinded, I fought for this, I will forever hold onto the anger that I rode into sobriety. 15+years of abusing opiates and nothing to show for it. Completely wasted my teens and twenties, and started life when many people my age already have a direction. 

Tell people you are struggling, tell people you want help, if no one will listen. Just keep reminding yourself that no one else can fix your problems. If you wont do it yourself, there is no way it will get done. If you wont fight for it, there will be no fight.

Stay strong folks, if I can do this, you can too.

> Trauma is the invisible force that shapes our lives. It shapes the way we live, the way we love and the way we make sense of the world. It is the root of our deepest wounds.  Dr. Maté gives us a new vision: a trauma-informed society in which parents, teachers, physicians, policy-makers and legal personnel are not concerned with fixing behaviors, making diagnoses, suppressing symptoms and judging, but seek instead to understand the sources from which troubling behaviors and diseases spring in the wounded human soul.

> With this film, we hope to touch many people, begin a conversation, and develop a common understanding about how trauma impacts our individual lives, communities and society as a whole.

Of course, there are images of drug use and paraphernalia, but it's not gratuitous.

I want to be sober again. I made it in the end of 2020. Getting off this stuff, waking up and not even thinking about to do drugs like its now. I made it once for 4 months and I want to go back there again. At least for the tolerance because my habbit is becoming too expensive. 

Im on a level right now where I need 7 40mg oxys to get a nice high for about 4 hours and then like another 6 hours without having WDs. 

I dont want to go cold turkey again since it is too brutal and I cant affort to be a zombie for weeks. I have to function normally more or less. 

So my plan is to taper down and today I made a very unexpected experience. I took only 1 40mg oxy and expected for it to not be enough to get rid off the WDs. To m suprise, 1 Oxys was enough for me to not feel any WDs. As I said, for a good high I need 7!. 

Now I wonder.... how would it be if I dont taper down slowly but just take 1 oxy at mornings and 1 in the evening to sleep well? Like for 10/14 days? Would it make my tolerance sink drastically? Maybe enough that like 3 Oxys or even 2 would totally flash me again? (I know it would take up again very fast, just need to know it for messurements) making it easier for me to jump? 

I always thought that tolerance sinks if you have WD symptoms (=pain). A friend of mine says, that even If I dont have any pain, my 7 oxy tolerance will sink because of me not consuming 7 pieces at once anymore on a daily habbit.

Did someone made similar experiences? Like having a huge tolerance but just needing a very small amount for relief? Do I really have to experience pain to be sure that my body build off his high tolerance?",2,0

I lusted for her to the point I of stealing conning and convincing my way to her, fuckin everything up on the way to her. I almost loved her like the dragon, but she was a whole other beast. Our adventures were ups and downs, but I realized there were more downs then ups.

 I went to get help to separate us. A few bumps-in with her during my 6 month get away. And that was that, no more dragon or monster chasing...

I wish that was the ending but it wasn't. One stressful night after a stressful work day, I went searching for my lost love... only to find the monster. We slowly started hanging out again. Until the wreckage got so bad I stole and stole and stole to be with her. I took a vehicle to go see her while last sick and flipped the truck, and somehow survived... woke up in a hospital, and was released only to steal yet another truck, ending me behind bars.

I was released two and a half years ago... and I still think about the dragon, but I haven't attempted to see her, and I never want to see the monster ever again. 2.5 years!!  And I haven't seen any beast! It is doable guys.

I am writing from the NYC Department of Health to see if anyone would be interested in this **paid opportunity**. 

We are looking for individuals who have lived experience with opioid use disorder and can speak to their experiences in the medical system. The goal of this project is to create a testimonial-style video (in-person with a crew) with real people who tell their stories (good and bad) about healthcare experiences in receiving general medical care and/or substance use treatment. Once completed, this video will be used to train new medical professionals on how to identify and combat stigma towards people who use(d) drugs. 

Due to the nature of this project, the testimonial will use your face/name and will NOT be anonymous. We understand that the lack of anonymity is a dealbreaker for many people and we do not want to pressure anyone who is uncomfortable with this. 

*We hope that this video will ultimately lead to less stigma in the medical system towards substance use.*

-------

**Logistical info:**

After expressing interest, there will be a **very brief phone call** to go over basics. 
If it seems like there is a good fit, we will conduct a **virtual Zoom interview** to learn a bit more and discuss logistics **(compensated $50).**
Anyone who completes the **in-person video shoot** will be compensated an **additional $500**. 
For mainly logistics-related reasons, we ask that people who contact us be in the NYC area and able to come to a full-day video shoot (sometime this spring/early summer). Because the shoot is in person, we are taking COVID safety precautions extremely seriously.

104,2021-06-20 16:36:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/o4egr3/i_need_to_get_clean/,I need to Get Clean.,"I am an ex-heroin addict. Well, take the word ""ex"" with a grain of salt. After maybe 3 years clean, except for the 2 Subxones (8mg/2mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone) and 4 10mg Ritalin I am prescribed per day by my addictionologist, I ended up using.
 
It was at the beginning of June. My friend from using from back in the day hit me up. He was wondering how I was doing. I was happy to hear he was still alive! He was like my best bud before I stopped. So we caught up. Then he let me know he is now selling. Oh boy. Maybe the message he sent was completely disingenuous. But obviously, the addict side of me was intrigued. Stupidly, I figured, well I can just do it once and have a heavenly weekend and let everything go back to normal on Monday. So I picked up maybe 3g of Black Tar Heroin on Friday night (maybe June 4th, 2021 around 5:00pm). And I enjoyed my weekend, thoroughly. And then the end of Sunday arrived, my sack was gone, and of course I was going to just let it be and stop.

Nope. I was hitting him up that Monday morning: ""You got anything? How quickly can you get here? Are you there? I'll uber you here immediately!"" So on and so forth. So on Monday, I picked up, and again and again until a few days ago. My next appointment with my addictionologist was on July 2nd, 2021 at 9:00am. I NEED to be clean for that appointment. This docotor is the world to me. Not only did he make me well and a functioning member of society again, but I live at my parents and they adore this doctor for what he did for me. I once tested postive for cocaine at an appointment with this doctor, and he then informed me that he has a ""3 strikes"" policy. If I test positive for illicit substances 3 times, he will drop me as a client. So I have one strike. But to say the least, getting a second strike would be bad. My parents might make me live in their shed again, and this doctor would lose all and total respect for me. So long story short, I need to be clean of this Black Tar Heroin by July 2, 2021 at 9:00am.

I took my last dose on June 19, 2021 around 3:00pm. It was so small, I didn't even feel it really. But at the morning of June 20, 2021 at roughly 7:00am, it was ROUGH. I was withdrawaling hardcore: cold sweats, diarreah, restlessness, runny nose, shakieness, sweating, vomiting, fatigue, etc. Luckily, I did some research on here as to how to handle withdrawals before I was withdrawaling. I basically read a series of things: generally take care of yourself and stay hydrated and eat, take vitamins, take suboxone if you have it, take some xanax if you have it, and lastly take some Maeng Da Kratom if you have it. Well, I have the subxone, I have the Maeng Da Kratom, and I have vitamins. I don't have xanax. I do have access to alcohol though, which is literally almost the exact same molecule as xanax. So more or less, I have everything I need to ride out the sickness.

Right now is June 20, 2021 at 1:20pm. I have taken 2 Subxones (8mg/2mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone), 4 tablespoons of Maeng Da Kratom, a multivitamin, 2 doses of Pepto-Bismol, 2 doses of Ibprophen, and I have driken one 42 ounce Steel Reserve Beer (8.1% alcohol/volume). This morning was BRUTAL, but at this point, I am well enough to be able type this post (due to the substances I have ingested). I feel a bit of sickness, but not anything terrible. I generally feel okay right now, but I know it will not last unless I keep up the regiment I previous described. So this leads me to a couple of questions.

Do you guys think I will be clean of the Black Tar Heroin by July 2, 2021 at 9:00am?

What if anything else, can I do to aliviate the symptoms of being dope sick in the short term?

What can I do to stay off the Heroin in the long term?

What other general comments, concerns, or issues do you guys have after reading my post?

What is anything else that comes to mind?

As always, thank you very much for reading and or responding. I am really roughing it here, and reading on r/OpiatesRecovery really is helping me get through this sickness. Hopefully it will also help me stay off of the Heroin for the long term. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing your responses (if there are any lol).",17,0

I’ve had addiction issues in the past that people were aware of but everyone thinks I’ve been clean since 2015 (on Methadone maintenance).

Fast forward to the end of 2018, I’m on my final doses of 1 freaking mg of Methadone a day and I get a huge amount of 50mg Tramadol handed to me. It’s been my secret since then, taking 200mg a day for the majority of that time until about 2 months ago when my dwindling supply forced me to start tapering myself off. I got down to 12.5mg of Tramadol a day, ran out, then split a single 10mg pill of Methadone into 4 doses taken every other day. As far as withdrawals go, they have been incredibly minor. Some nausea, loose stools, discomfort, etc. I do smoke weed, so I’m sure that has also helped a lot.

I feel like such a fool for not stopping sooner as I was so scared to go through withdrawals and having my wife find out. I also feel incredibly lucky for feeling the way I do when I know it can be much worse. I really want to stay away this time.

Back then I had survived a near-fatal overdose and ICU+hospitalization (passed out for 30 hours, kidneys failed, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, the whole 9 yards) which left me with two big fasciotomy scars on the outside and a torn mind on the inside. Suffered a probably minor anoxic brain injury as well due to opioid induced hypoxia. Got sober for a while from a 10+ year benzo addiction but never stopped to figure out the real problem, and it came to bite me in the ass in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I started using buprenorphine as a coping method.

Fast forward from late 2019: used 1-2 mg of buprenorphine nasally for over a year and then I broke down. I completed an inpatient detox and transferred into inpatient rehab and reached the 2 month mark as of last Thursday. 

But this shit is hard. Ever since the overdose I've been battling crippling fatigue, mental fog, concentration and memory issues, anxiety attacks and feelings of giving up. The fatigue was the reason I started using buprenorphine in the first place, as it made me more resistant to work related stress and temporarily gave me energy to overcome the fatigue. But since mid 2017,  no matter how well I eat and sleep, and rest, these symptoms won't go away. 

Apparently my brain chemistry is pretty much screwed still, first day of detox I suffered a brief seizure and was detoxed from gabapentin, buprenorphine as well as Bupropion at the same time. 

Never had a ""pink cloud"" moment, either. Pretty much the only thing keeping me sober right now is the fact that I won't physically survive another overdose, and that in order to take tests for the brain injury, I need to have a long stretch of verified clean time. I've been attending NA meetings and I've got some support meds prescribed to me (antidepressants, buspirone and hydroxyzine).

The past 60 days have been the worst time of my life hands down. It's hard to motivate yourself to rebuild things when each and every day feels like a struggle, not recovery.

I never experienced the type of withdraws when i was only doing pills, before I ever tried H. Once I started doing  H regularly that's when it started to get tough. But I was able to get my hands on Suboxone for a while and I felt like I had control of the H. Took it for granted, fell back into H even deeper to where Suboxone wasn't helping much, or would put me in immediate withdraws that I didn't wanna face again after couple bad experiences...And then someone recommended Methadone. I didn't know too much about it, other then basic stuff, but bcuz my insurance covered everything 100% unlike Suboxone etc. I gave methadone a try...and to be honest I liked the idea of it not blocking H if I wanted to do some once in a while...basically I wasn't ready to get clean and was only lying to myself. So for the last 3 years I've been on methadone...finally got stable dose at 110mg, and eventually started going down. I'm currently at 50mg...but the lower it gets the harder it is, esp when I gave in couple times cuz I ran into an old friend etc...but as I said; I'm trying to get off of M, but noticed that I fell into depression, lost weight again, can't keep a job plus the COVID didn't help...i don't know exactly what I'm trying to say here, it's my first time, but just wanted to open up and share my story. Basically at the moment I'm at 50mg, but noticed that my mental health is becoming a concern. I'm not suicidal or never was, but once ur tempering off of M, u gotta keep ur mind occupied. I didn't expect anxiety and depression to become a bigger problem than methadone itself, at least right now. Is anyone on methadone treatment here that's also going down? Or at stable dose, and if so how much? And also wanted to ask if anyone is experiencing same mental health issues as me? 
I wouldn't mind trying some new meds for my anxiety but nothing addictive I guess, last thing I need is to get hooked on Benzos as well, even tho they do provide good relief. But what about Zoloft, Mirtazapine? Anyone try these? 
I dunno how many ppl will actually read this but if u do read it and can relate, I'd love to hear ur story. Thanks",3,1

Why else would I have ever chosen to always, always make my way through each sunnily wretched day on the path of most resistance?

Perhaps it is my desire for the pleasure I find within the pain that’s made me this way. The concave space inside of my chest it feels so cold, cruel, and hollow that I would always choose to have fun today at any expense of tomorrow. And then that sorrow, it follows, rolls over and upside down, weaves around like a wisp of smoke- a ghost of that fickle euphoria I gladly traded for every last iota of hope.

To be a bit less cryptic about why this post exists... surely it’s obvious I instantaneously ended up back in the crushing caress of dope (after just leaving treatment less than a fortnight ago) It’s also glaringly apparent how much I regret it, how little I knew of what was to come, what I would go on to give up in exchange for about my thirty three thousandth chance to decide enough is enough.

I have lost very much along the way, but this time I am losing my entire reality .... moving 12 hours from my mom who I’m extremely close with and have been my entire life.... my best friend is taking care of my cat for... I don’t want to think about how long... my job, my place, most of my material possessions... all because I told myself “you can just get clean again like you do every time you relapse” 

The moratorium on karmic debt certainly did beat the odds for how long it went on, me fucking off saying “I do what I want.” I regret all of it, but especially this, make no mistake I’ve never done drugs because of an inclination to want them. Rather, the antithesis, an obsessive compulsion I wished desperately underneath every shooting star I’d see that maybe someday I might stop.

Hasn’t happened yet. At least not for longer than it took the ghouls and monsters to catch their way up.

Oh dear, seems this time I’ll have to actually turn and face them.

The last time I used any opiates was 8 years ago, and I was never super deep into addiction in the first place, but I definitely have those tendencies. As a teenager I used to buy pain pills from people and steal from parents, grandparents, and friends. I never got to the point where I was using every day, but maybe every week. Then in college I realized I had to get clean because I want to work in the medical field, and more or less managed it since it became easier to avoid triggers like being alone in a parent/grandparents house or hanging out w the same sketchy people I did in high school. 

So I'm not an addict... or am I? This whole time I've never stopped seeing someone's medicine cabinet and wondering what's in it, or occasionally having dreams where I find some pills somewhere, or secretly hoping I can legally get prescribed some kind of opiate. Recently I had an arm injury where this almost came up, but luckily the Dr. just said to take Advil. And I need to get my wisdom teeth out eventually but am nervous of what if they give me Vicodin and it triggers something. Like if I had a prescription, I would totally  want to take 3 pills at a time instead of 1. 

So, does this mean I'm close enough to being addicted that I should try to avoid painkillers? I'm hoping by now I would have the self control to avoid getting addicted, but a lot of the people in my life don't know I have this problem and I was never in any kind of treatment. But I am worried about in the future if I am in pain and need them. Is this something I should tell a doctor if they try to prescribe me opiates?",2,0

Found a research paper the day before my shot showing how kratom was a pretty potent cox2 inhibitor which is why you’re not supposed to take NSAIDs the day of the shot. Thankfully I’d only been using 2 months this time around due to an infected tooth. Now I’m about 35 hours off and feeling pretty good compared to last time when I was using for a year. Only thing that worries me is I never get sick while using but always seem to get sick soon after quitting. 

Was wondering if anyone else got the shot during withdrawals and if so did they seem to have a bad reaction?",1,2

My assistant at work said this as well. Said that she’d been to detox dozens of times and that she always felt fine after the detox.

Then a third friend told me “bro.. you’re not gonna be able to work”. Another friend agreed with him lol, so now I don’t know what to think.

Just wondering if anyone’s tried this or not.. what your results were, and how you went about it?

Two years ago I was in treatment for heroin for the fifth time. I had just been released from 8 months inpatient treatment, relapsed immediately, and then went to a 28 day treatment. 

While at the 28 day place I applied to school for a Master of Social Work. After all, rehab was my favorite place to be (I don’t know why, I’ve always loved it. Never a dull moment). I figure the best most affordable way to be in rehab forever is to work at one. I was accepted to school for a 2 year fast track masters program. 

Even though I relapsed again right after that last treatment, I started school anyways. I continued to use until my internship at a rehab was around the corner and I knew it was time. I quit at home, cold turkey, using my own detox recipe (in my post history, it was the smoothest WD ever). Once I started my internship and was actively helping other addicts, my desire to use was completely lifted. 

I applied for counselor positions before I realized I need to actually have my MSW to get a job. So instead I went to a 1 week training to be a Certified Recovery Coach while I went through school. I got certified and was offered a job at a community recovery center teaching art classes and as a one on one recovery coach. No one ever asked how long I’d been clean when applying places, which was something I had been worrying about. 

I continued working as a recovery coach, going to school full time, and completed 2 internships at rehabs in those 2 years. During this time I lived with my grandma. I made $14,000 total last year at this recovery coaching job (granted, I only worked 8-16 hrs/week because school). It wasn’t much but I loved every second of it. Some might consider this struggling but I was so happy. 

I graduated with my Master of Social Work on May 1 this year. Three different rehabs offered me a job as a counselor immediately (I had a lot of connections from networking while recovery coaching and my passion for this career and helping others was apparently attractive to these places). I took a job with the last place I had been to treatment in 2019! 

Also, in 2017, I was kicked out of this rehab for sneaking in drugs. They allowed me to come back in 2019. And now they are allowing me to work there as a counselor!! Life is crazy. I also got married on May 30 and I’m currently 20 weeks pregnant, living with my husband, and we are about to buy a bigger house with the addition of my income.

If you think things are too hard to change, you won’t try. Please try!! Follow your dreams. If you want to help other addicts and only have a HS diploma or GED, become a certified recovery coach! Working in the field in any capacity is extremely rewarding and makes it exponentially easier to stay clean. As soon as I had other addicts relying on me to stay sober, it wasn’t just about me anymore and I had true motivation to stay clean. It is rewarding, beautiful, wonderful. Don’t give up, you never know what can happen! This was all following 19 straight years of active addiction. I love you all and wish the best for you… recovery is always possible <3

TL;DR: after 19 years in active addiction, I applied for school, became a certified recovery coach, got my Master of Social Work in 2 years, and now work as a counselor at a rehab. Life is beautiful!

If someone would have told me in January of 2019 that this is where I would be just a few years later, I would have laughed in their face. I was broken, miserable, with nothing. I had no hope and no desire to change. The best I could manage was wanting to want to be sober, but I couldn’t imagine actually wanting it. And yet, here I am.",11,0

I’m also prescribed Gabapentin and Clonidine, but I can’t take much Clonidine at all or I get really dizzy and low blood pressure issues, my heart skips beats.     

At night I do not sleep at all. I’ve been up all night yet again, will eventually pass out for a 2-hour nap, then up all night again.  I tried taking a low dose of Lorazepam (1mg) to try and sleep and it doesn’t work. I have no current tolerance to benzos since I didn’t take them for years while I was taking opioids, I was so sure that they would work, but they don’t. I’ve also tried various strengths of melatonin and 5-HTP along with a herbal sleep formula. Was like taking candy.

My next options available at home are: temazepam, flexeril, or alprazolam (it’s an old expired prescription though) I also have some low-dose zolpidem. Would any of these work for my needs? Also the muscle pain/spasticity is way worse at night. I don’t want to take Kratom or weed. Weed makes me anxious. 

I have a Dr appointment next week for a follow up (my PCP) so if anything else would work better I can ask her for a trial prescription. She’s not an expert in this stuff so I’d appreciated hearing from those who have experience with insomnia caused by weaning. My pain management Dr will not accommodate more than Clonidine, and he’s hostile so I’m turning to my PCP who knows me well and is treating my initial health condition.  

I think I’m going to go try the zolpidem now, and see if that helps. This is getting old fast. Thank you.",1,0

I even have clonidine and gabapentin and this shit is stillllll literally un fucking forgiving. It’s so bad I can’t even explain the full on scenario of it. And I just found out the other day ( I live in shitty ohio) that the purple and blue dope that’s always around these parts is more than likely fent cut with what is it brophine or some shit. That’s supposedly stronger than fent.  But also just who the fuck even knows about all the trash that’s thrown in it. Between all the different filler cuts but then you also have people putting multiple different opiates in the shit. Xanax. The whole 9. Whatever happened to just doing an opiate if I need an opiate. Now I gotta take chances in doing all these different fucked up ass things man it’s just not right it’s gotten so bad I don’t even know what to say about it. All I know is that I’m almost positive I’m detoxing from at least 4-5 different things that has been in this dope and it’s kicking my fucking ass hard. My stomach is by far one of the worse things. But also my organs hurt. The mental is fucked. I can’t eat and drink normal by any means so I’m always feeling worse I feel like than I at least would be if I were eating and drinking like I should. But what the fuck else am I to do you know. If I can’t do it I can’t do it. As far as eating a decent amount and keeping hydrated. I basically do the bare minimum of everything just to basically stay alive going through this. But fuck it’s just been days now and I feel like at times it’s actually getting worse. Idk I guess at this point one of the absolute hardest things is just not knowing when the end is going to be. Because it’s not in sight at all. And I’ve been using for so long now obviously don’t even remember what it feels like to be “normal” again. And to not feel either sick every day or just busted down. Cause fuck me man even when I was using everyday unless I used like 1.5-2 grams plus which I never really did because well I don’t have more than 150 per day to blow on this bullshit. So most of the time I was just barely getting by even when I was using. It was always never enough or never good enough. And then the last year or more has been the worse by far. I got used to doing this really good really strong shit that was actually giving me a buzz which now a days would take a miracle to be high. But the problem was I did that shit for say.... 2 months straight. Well when it dried up and a bunch of other shit hit the street literally none of it even came close
To stacking up to that shit I was doing. So now I’m blowing 150 plus a day and it isn’t even getting me all the way off sick and shit. You want to talk about a real fucking nightmare. Jesus Christ. Anyways. That’s in the past.

I’m 17 and I started abusing pharma oxys about two months ago. I started with 10 mg which was, at first, so effective that I could not get up or function properly. Towards the end, I was using up to 40-50 mgs a day even though it made me extremely nauseous. I was throwing up twice day and was starting to think of giving a tolerance break. I took my last dose on thursday, which was 5 days ago. I hadn’t certainly decided that I would go cold turkey and quit overall, but on Friday I woke up with so much nausea that I could not use any. On Saturday, the nausea and throwing up continued, so again I didn’t use any. Through these first days, I did not know about withdrawal symptoms. I did not know anything about withdrawing and just assumed that I had the flu or stomach bug. Until my sister asked me if i was doing any drugs consistently. That was when it hit me and I started searching for remedies and reading countless Reddit entries. My bones were aching, I wasn’t getting any sleep and worst of all I had this insane nausea (also diarrhea). I was also mentally exhausted, feeling like there was no point in living. Today, I still have nausea, insomnia and depression. I am also starting to question why I quit in the first place and I am on the verge of relapsing. I really really want to use again. But I actually did want to give a tolerance break, A TOLERANCE BREAK, not dropping it completely. I know that this isnt just an innocent habit and has the potential of ruining my life. But part of me is trying to convince me that it will be okay to use just this once or continue like I did the past two months. I am so close to giving in but I know I will be feeling so much guilt. I dont have anyone to talk to and I have no hope for the future. Any advice is appreciated…",1,0

   Could use some words of encouragement or advice. I’m a Crohn’s Disease survivor. I am on the tail end of a major flare which saw me getting a bowel resection during the pandemic. I fought a stricture/bottleneck in my intestines for a year leading up to it. Which included dozens of trips to the ER where I was given loads of IV morphine and Dilaudid. We fought it fir too long and should have opted for surgery and my pain med tolerance skyrocketed. 
    A year ago I had the surgery. I left the hospital having taken Ketamine. Horrible experience. But went home with Fentanyl patches, Dilaudid and Oxycodone. 
   I have worked my tail off to taper over the last year to get where I am today. Today I’m taking (2)5mg pills of Oxycodone per day. They want me to taper 10% every month. Last month we dropped from 15 pills per week to 14. 
   To help me I have Clonidine, I use 6 Red Bali Kratom caps morning and then at night. 
   I also walk twice per day, meditate and have a yoga practice. This week will be my third session for acupuncture and I talk to a PTSD counselor once per week. I also make sure to hydrate and I juice and take Magnesium. I also have Ativan and use .5 mg when I absolutely need it. 
   Last night I had a horrible panic attack. We dropped a week ago, so the symptoms are right on time. 
   At this rate I’ll be tapering into the holidays. My doctors don’t want me to jump saying the WD would last weeks. My mental state is slowly improving and I’ve gained 10lbs last month. 
  I know I’m not on a lot of med. This is my third surgery and opiates played a major role in all three surgeries so I know this game well. I’m just tired. I’m getting hour stretches where I feel normal, feel like the real me. 
    My body is fighting so hard. Then the symptoms come in and trigger my PTSD and things get turbulent. I have suffered greatly. I have an ileostomy bag and probably will the rest of my life. I’m so proud of myself honestly. For making it this far and not giving up. 
   I’m hanging in there. You know, watching all 6 Lord of The Rings (Extended Editions) over and over again as one does. I’ve started reading again. Been slowly getting back into cooking which I love. 

I’m praying and I have support. And I have the will. But I can’t help thinking I’d be saving myself a lot of suffering if I just stopped. I have a lot more support then most and I’m very grateful for that. I’ve worked so hard. The weight in my shoulders is really heavy right now. I’m crying a lot. And laying the pain and terror down as I crawl forward. I’m going to win. One way or another. I will win. It’s that simple. 
    Yesterday, I got news my Crohn’s went into remission. I’ve worked my inflammatory markers down low enough. Amazing news. 
   This thing should have broken me a long time ago. And it didn’t. I’ll never quit. When your intestines lock up and there’s fires burning inside the opiates were there to catch me. And I’m grateful for that. At the same time I hate them. I hate the doctors, the drug company’s. I hate what it’s done me, people I know and what it’s done to my city. I hate the struggle. And I love it. It’s terrifying and so beautiful at the same time. I’ve been crying all morning on my walk. Im starting to feel again. But it’s like a tv with bad connection. It’s clear for a few hours. I think about the future and about things I enjoy thinking about. And it’s so peaceful. 
    I drop my guard and then it’s comes for me. No warning. Then it’s back to war. I know you all understand what I’m saying. And I tip my hat to every single one of you. 
  I’m looking for any words of advice or encouragement. I know when I need it.

If there is anyone who is interested in joining me in this endeavor, please message (PM) me, if you end up relapsing during the next few days, please don't tell me, and you can vanish with no judgment or hard feelings.  


I know NA and AA are options, but I currently can't drive, and the online sessions are beneficial, but I'm looking for a deeper connection.  
I am okay with people discussing how much pain they are also in but to avoid the ""misery loves company"" pain amplification, I've been told I am a good listener and analyzer, and would like to follow up with us by watching motivational youtube videos or distractive movies together.  


I am not suicidal, I am simply at the end of my rope here, and now is the only time I have left to do this.  
I am looking for comrades,  sober mentors, and even experienced a temporary pro bono therapist interaction. I am desperate to overcome this cognitive restructuring, but after many solo attempts, I have realized social support is the most vital factor in achieving success. I'm willing to put it all on the line and trust that there is someone(s) that upon reading this feels a gut pull to answer this, thank you and I gladly await your PM.",2,0

At the moment I don't think I have felt more isolated in my life and it's all because of this codeine addiction.

I am getting so tired of having to wear this fake fucking mask 18 hours a day. It's exhausting. 

I've been addicted to codeine for way too long now and every time I get it in my head that ""today's the last day"" something in life hits me with brute force and I'm back to square one. Me and my partner are going through a tough time at the moment and I have to put on a strong presence for her to make sure is ok. I can't burden her with more shit in her life.

I have tried to taper but it never works. It's my fault, I won't blame anything else, I chicken out and I fuck up again and again. I tried to get advice from a local addiction centre but they didn't return my call and when I sent them a follow up email, it went unanswered.

I'm in the UK so my addiction comes with over the counter Codeine products. It's costing my a clean fortune right now and health wise, I don't understand how my body hasn't shut down.

I need help. If I speak to my GP, are they able to prescribe me something to help with this or do I need to bite the bullet and just stick with a taper plan and actually do it. The WDs are gross.. I always get this strange warm flush feeling going up my neck into my head and it just feels horrible as I knows it's like a mental message reminding me to take something.",4,1

I’m not a morning person. When I wake up, it takes me like 40 min to a hour to fully wake up. Till then I’m groggy no matter how many hours of sleep I get the night before. 

However, when I would snort 30s ALL the time, I could wake up on 6 hours or even LESS with absolutely no grogginess whatsoever. Like none. Obviously the first thing I’d do after waking is snort up some more. But there was some “productive” aspect to the drug I really craved in the morning…maybe something to do with dopamine levels?? I’ll also add after I woke up I would sometimes snort enough to nod me off back to bed if I felt like it, despite that prob being super dangerous. 

This isn’t a post glorifying those nasty fent 30s. Just wondering if anyone else gets/got a similar effect. I’m maybe 5 or 6 weeks off 30s and despite the sleep grogginess I feel better than ever and am so happy to be off that shit for good.",3,0

I live far from friends and family so none of them even know I’m addicted. I want to quit but I’m so frustrated that I even got addicted in the first place.

Corona hit me hard and I had to move in w my bf temporarily (4mo) to save on bills. His drug of choice is percocets. I take them occasionally  but my sister was a heroin addict so I’ve never been a huge fan. Since he liked the drug so much he was constantly pushing them on me. He wanted me to take them on dates, anytime he wanted to perk my mood up he gave me them. Some days I would say stop I don’t want it and he still would push them on me. One day I woke up and was addicted. I don’t even enjoy opiates, I don’t even feel them anymore but I’m physically addicted. The withdrawals are so hard and I’m on heroin now. 

I’m just so angry. I wouldn’t be here if I had never  moved in with him. He got arrested for flying with 100 oxys so he’s clean now and I’m still addicted. I feel like none of this was my choice. It’s hard for me to accept my part in my addiction because I would have never got her if I never moved in with him. I don’t know how to quit.

Thinking about using some drug money (I spend about 200/4days) to fly a friend out for a week to babysit while I detox. I truly don’t want to use this stuff and think if I got past the withdrawals I could be clean again...

Understand what the addict mindset does to a persons brain chemistry. you need the drug. you become a fiend for it. you start to do things that you normally wouldn’t to obtain the powder. you become a different you.

Now think back to how life used to be when you didn’t numb yourself up everyday with drugs. Pretty joyful and full filling huh? This can become reality again but you have be willing to take all the pain that comes with it.

This has obviously been hell. Mostly stomach cramps and pooping alot. My question is this . What and where do i go from here ? I feel hopeless. I have gotten almost 3 days of 1/4 every 12 hours and can't imagine even pushing it ONE more hour or cutting the dose more.

I had dabbled with opioids and found it an enjoyable experience but in an almost underwhelming way. Fast forward a bunch and I am forced to have a spine surgery which looked to be going great until at the 8 month mark of recovery it went south and my spine is collapsing. After many months of immense suffering one doctor prescribed me opiods which I to this day attend saved me from suicide but they started treating me like an addict very soon (despite well documented issues and a having a common source of immense pain) and at some point they all gave me the toss around. I have experienced full blown morphine second life dreams (a finer one admitedly) but rapidly grew contempt even with that feeling and I only cared about stopping my pain. I have been through Cocaine addicition which I found way more addictive and destructive but I willpowered out of it by just choosing to do the right thing and weird thing is that I since never felt a pull to it and if I did a few lines on a social gathering I never felt the urge to binge again. I tried many other hard drugs and I was always able to responsible control my use (only exception being my very few Xanax blackout experiences which led to me being extra vigilant and cautious and taught me that benzos are no fucking joke...with cocaine I would almost choose to do more when I was binging on it but as soon as the memory went off god knew what could have went down and I never plan on blacking out and I am probably never eating those 2 roofies a guy gifted to me) and even though opioids are clearly my downer of choice I rarely feel in the mood to get off on them (prescription or not). I always made lean with my Codeine scripts (some pharma level shit) but I was never compelled to take more than prescribed (very often taking less and 98% of the time just the minimum ammount below my script max that would prevent the pain from waking me up at night...and only at night), could always abstain no matter the ammount of pain which really ruins my life and even after having a few nice experiences abusing it I still never cared more. I had also tried crushed Tillidin ERs which were a fuckload more intense but didn't have the chance of a memorable transcendent experience on them despite intense hypnagogia. Also I have never experienced opioid withdrawal symptoms (I didn't manage to sleep without opioids anyways and not sleeping at all after taking them for a while might have caused one or two extra yawns and maybe a possibly runnier shit after getting rid of the last tiny woodlike pellet codeine/antihicholinergics induce) but have been through mild alcohol withdrawal after naively drinking socially everyday for a small phase of my life and it was pretty miserable alright... have only drunk a total of 5 small beers in the last 5 months and quit coffee too. 

My question to you is if anyone here finds my perception and use of these substances half relatable for my introduction to opis and my 5 month codeine script phase but then something physiological changed and suddenly made him crave them unconditionally (I learnt the feeling but gotten over it within a couple days worth by accepting the momentary and random nature of my rare uber-bliss experiences and just cherish the moment without expecting it to come back). I was forced off the tiny script I was on but since I have found no other solution for the pain yet (no medication or excercise available except opioids worked) I plan on venturing on RCs but want to make sure I am not about to fuck my life up.

Struggled several months with the wd (and i have mental health issues, too, that i wanted to address once i am clean). Then in March all hell broke loose while i was in SEA.
Made it until early June of 2020 when i returned to Europe. Relapsed right away and then sobered up/relapsed again 3 times between June and August but finally caved in August 2020. I was so stressed and worn out. And now, one year later, its pretty bad again. Well, I am still functioning, like, i have work and a home. But i went back on mmt recently and i left there crying, i felt so defeated.
And to be honest, with the pandemic...I felt like this must be a joke. 
After decades of mmt and heroin i had finally powered through months of suffering to become independent, to be free to go where ever i wanted and build a new life.
Only that this was suddenly not possible anymore. Everything was uncertain and i found myself trapped again. This time without being dependent on opiates. 
I felt so betrayed somehow. And of course it was very difficult to get help at all in that situation. 

I don't know, i don't think i am looking for an excuse. I just think it was an incredibly hard time to stay clean and keep going on this new path within all the madness that had suddenly surrounded us.

Though I didn't get any physical withdrawals, the mental fatigue was  as worse as first 30 days. 

I don't think there is a responsible way for me to use opiates.",4,0

When will the night sweats and insomnia stop?,"Throwaway account to keep this anonymous. I’m 34 and have been fighting opioid addiction for more than a decade. I recently detoxed off 5-6 pressed 30s daily for the last 6-9 months. I attempted to detox a Fe’s times during that period and would always cave by day 7 and restart the vicious cycle that we all know. 

Fast forward to today - I’ve finally been blessed with a bit of willingness and have stayed clean long enough to remember why I want this more than anything. I value my life, relationship with my soon to be fiancé, career, family, etc. way more than any part of me that would still consider getting loaded. Oh yeah, I don’t want to die either. Sometimes I’m honestly perplexed at why I’m still here and so many people I’ve known over the years are six feet under. I’m done abusing my life and going through this tortuous cycle. 

That said, I’m actually doing really well physically and emotionally for being close to 30 days. I still have some slight chills and of course the sneezes, though the latter are decreasing with each additional day of sobriety. 

The one thing that’s taking forever to go away (I know I need to be patient and am doing my best) are the night sweats. I’m still waking up covered in sweat every single night. That’s 27 consecutive stinky, sweaty nights. Sometimes it feels like it’s getting better but it’s hard to tell. Anyone have a similar experience coming off these nasty presses? Oxy was my previous DOC and the sweats were always gone by this point. 

And regarding sleep, it’s getting better but I’m definitely not sleeping through the night yet. Thank god I’m now falling asleep pretty easily, but I wake up at least once or twice and generally can’t go back to bed after 4:30am. I’ve been getting up at 5am which I’m actually loving, but my concern is I’m not getting enough sleep in the long run. 

Any advice the group can share would be much appreciated here. I’m SO glad to have broken this cycle and will continue to do what I need to take care of myself emotionally, physically and spiritually. F**k active addiction! Life is so much better on the other side.",28,0

Started with 30-60mg every couple of weeks, watching a film, started taking higher amounts and more often but nothing too damaging. But then in the past few years I started taking it every weekend, avoiding seeing friends, and this got worse last year during lockdown. 

I know codeine is seen as a shitty baby drug and I wasn't taking it every day, but taking 300mg once or twice a week really started to fuck me up.

I'd be in a terrible mood the day after, then about 3 or 4 days later really getting the horrors - anxiety and depression in a big way - then I'd take more codeine to avoid it. 

Two weeks ago my stash of codeine ran out and knowing how much damage it was doing to my social life, testosterone levels and mental health I decided not to buy anymore. (I still have a handful of 120mg ER DHC but the buzz from those isn't so nice so I've not had the urge to take them.)

This means the past couple of weekends I've made an effort to go out with friends, gone to parties, met girls and felt like I was really living life again. I'm really enjoying this and don't want to fuck it up. 

What are some good coping methods to get through those boring nights when I'm sober and just want to experience something fun? (I take Pregabalin a couple of times a week and that helps, but can't stand weed and don't drink much, sometimes take ketamine.)

Part of me thinks that I could allow myself one codeine session a month, like 210mg stretched out over an evening. I don't have a massively addictive personality, despite what it might sound like. Does anyone else manage a once in a blue moon blowout with a normal life? I'm worried that I'll end up stopping in alone on a Saturday night soon and end up climbing the walls in boredom and will circle back into a bad habit again.

He is a well-known psychiatrist and psychotherapist and has made a name for himself with psychedelic therapy.
He believes that psychedelics can help fight addiction. In particular, psychedelics are predestined to find out the cause of why one became addicted in the first place.
After years or decades of using opiate or stimulants you forget what was the reason for the addiction. I mean yes, sometimes you can say it was because of a trauma or injury. A broken bone may not necessarily lead to addiction.
In addicts, it is often because there is a profound trauma or an innate or acquired (this is where trauma comes into play especially in childhood and birth) imbalance of the neurotransmitters.
Some psychedelic drugs can ''reset'' this imbalance but during this phase of ego death one can experience the worst things. Whereby these experiences could explain the possible reasons for the addiction. And if you know the profound cause, then you can control the addiction or craving well.
There have already been studies with LSD, Iboga and Salvia in relation to addiction disorders. There are also studies that certain psychedelics can rapidly lower tolerance by interfering with the NMDA receptor antagonism, making withdrawal easier. These were positive - IF they were carried out under professional control.
I haven't taken any psychedelics yet, although I've always been interested. Especially in Mescaline and mushrooms. Not because of the intoxication, but to see if they could help me fight against craving for pharmaceutical-opiates.

What do you think?

It is also clear that taking psychedelics while heavily dependent on opiates or stimulants can cause great psychological damage (and sometimes without concomitant addiction).
So this is not meant to be a call to try it.

I just want to hear experiences who have tried something like this.",3,0

I want to become the guy I've always wanted.,"Hi. I hope there is someone who got off and made the impossible possible so he can help me.

I'am on opiates for 5 years now. Started with tramadole,  continued with high doses of Kratom and finally consumed very larg doses of Oxy (at least 280mg oxy to get a good high).

The drug gave me the energy I always seeked for. It made me, a usually shy and silent guy, very talkative and energetic. I dont need to describe you the euphoria, how everything becomes nice and chill and you are just in the mood for almost doing everything.

I was a very lonely guy who only got himself (my parents loves me but we dont harmonize very well). I met my first girlfriend in my mid 20's. It was last year. 

After only 2 months she already left me. It totally broke me down. Thats why my doses went up from 120mg oxy to unbelievable high amounts like 240-280mg of oxy or snorting 70-80mg of hydro daily. 

I just wanted to get rid of this lifestyle, become a new guy. Even tho I broke down because of her, I withdrawn and faced a hellish time.

It took soooo much time, almost 4-6 weeks for me to feel a bit normal again. Training my brain to be normal. Cant believe I thrown that much effort away. My dreams were very chaotic. Without lyrica, I couldnt even sleep. Lyrica was the only reason I could handle the pain. 

I made it sober like 2 months. I actually had a normal life again. I trained like a beast in the gym and even become very strong and my stamina levels rised up to levels I never reached before. Then an idiotic idea came to my mind. Since I cant drink alcohol because I have a rare allergic reaction to it, I tried to find a way to be ""cool"" at partys. I started chipping. Once a week I allowed me to consume 40mg of oxys. I have my friend the control of my pills so I really only could use once a week.

I met my new girlfriend at that time who makes me very happy till this day. An extremely engergetic girl who cant just sit still. Traveling and doing stuff all day long. I always used a oxy on my date to be at the same level as her.

2 months after chipping corona stroke back. My main way to cope, the gym, closed. I went back to my dealer, lying to myself with ""Yo, use a week and then stop"". You know how this ended. Im fullblown back at my high doses and I dont know how to get back again. And also it dosnt make me that energetic anymore. I somehow have the feeling that opiates makes me think its fine to lay in bed all day long and sleep. I want to get back but It crushes me to think about all the effort it cost me a few months ago... 6 weeks of depressions. I really cant affort to be depressive 6 weeks while I have my new girlfriend. I really love her and we are totally at a same wavelenght. But she also says so me, that in the last time she noticed, that Im sleeping and chilling in bed the whole time, which is true. 

I so so wish to become like her. I want to become the kind of guy who makes excersices and yoga under the sun in the park. Eats clean and has power and stamina at very high levels. Who dosnt need drugs to be talkative and energetic.

I really made it 1 once. I was sober for 2 months, not even thinking about consuming. But it cost me much time. I need at least 1 months to chill in bed on lyrica to handle the WDs, make small exercises and sleep well. But in the otherhand I have my girlfriend who is too energetic for me to chill in bed and WD for a month. Im thinking about tapering down very slow, so there wouldnt be much pain, but I dont know. I really want to be like her. She always says to me that she kinda wishes I would not be a sleepy guy all the time. She dosnt even know that this could be a symptom of opiates. But at the same time, it is the stuff which gives me power and energy.

It is even possible? To become the guy who enjoys life without opiates, who has energy and power at max levels... the guy who meditates under trees and gets his power by the nature. I really want to become that kind of guy... but I became a sleepy, weak and opiate addicted guy once again. At doses which scares me to WD once again. 

Did someone made back to life and even become the best himself ever? Do you guys know how I cant WD that shit without being too sleepy and knocked out for my new Gf?.",4,1

I had a huge breakdown around 4 days off opiates and I think I’ve been in psychosis ever since..

I’m doing this alone and I’m in a relationship that is very rocky and dealing with all my mental illness now that I suppressed for 5 years is all hitting me at once and I could literally slit my own throat with a smile on my face right now.

This isn't the first time I've gone through withdrawal from these awful pills, but it has certainly been the worst. I'm really trying to quit this time and have been trying to kick it at home with weed, lots of water and gatorade, small meals that are easy on my stomach, and light cardio exercises just to get my mind off of it. All three have worked pretty well, not too much of a smoker as I used to be and just started smoking to cope with the withdrawal starting today and I was surprised by how much it helps with the muscle cramps and nausea. Unfortunately, the plug hit me up today and I just couldn't resist the temptation. I snagged one pill, and just took a small bump of it which, and I hate to say it, made me feel SO much better. I'm wondering if there's a way for me to ration out this last pill and taper it so when I'm completely off this bs the withdrawal symptoms won't be so uncomfortable. For context, when I was fully on this stuff it was for about 2 and a half weeks. I'd take small bumps but I'd take like 5-6 throughout the day, starting at 7:30am before I go to work, one on my lunch break, and the rest in the evenings after my shift.

I am writing from the NYC Department of Health to see if anyone would be interested in this **paid opportunity**. 

We are looking for individuals who have lived experience with opioid use disorder and can speak to their experiences in the medical system. The goal of this project is to create a testimonial-style video (in-person with a crew) with real people who tell their stories (good and bad) about healthcare experiences in receiving general medical care and/or substance use treatment. Once completed, this video will be used to train new medical professionals on how to identify and combat stigma towards people who use(d) drugs. 

Due to the nature of this project, the testimonial will use your face/name and will NOT be anonymous. We understand that the lack of anonymity is a dealbreaker for many people and we do not want to pressure anyone who is uncomfortable with this. 

**We hope that this video will ultimately lead to less stigma in the medical system towards substance use.**

**Logistical info:**

After expressing interest, there will be a **very brief phone call** to go over basics. 
If it seems like there is a good fit, we will conduct a **virtual Zoom interview** to learn a bit more and discuss logistics **(compensated $50).**
Anyone who completes the **in-person video shoot** will be compensated an **additional $500**. 
For mainly logistics-related reasons, we ask that people who contact us be in the NYC area and able to come to a full-day video shoot (sometime this spring/early summer). Because the shoot is in person, we are taking COVID safety precautions extremely seriously.

I lived there full time, during the program you don't have a job and are solely focused on recovery, then i did the 2nd half of their program where you still live there but have a job and some freedom and then lived in a sober house for a while... life was good, i never thought I'd have to worry about it ever again. A few weeks ago I was VERY injured at work requiring emergency surgery and all that.. it was bad. The doctor would ONLY prescribe me 5×5mg percs, knowing how much pain i was in I actually followed the dosing instructions because I wanted to make them last because I TRULY needed them.. well after 2 days I'd taken all 5 and was REFUSED any refills and was in AGONIZING pain, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't sit down, all I could do was lay in my side and literally cry (in the Army I fractured 4 vertebrae during a airborne jump gone bad and that pain was NOTHING compared to what I was experiencing..) so a friend gave me some fentynal to snort and it helped, I used it for 3 or 4 days while I was still in pain and now I cant stop (fml right?!?) I've now been using daily for over a month. All I can think about is how fucking stupid I am for letting this shit takenover my life again, and I NEED to quit before I'm too far gone and living on the streets. Unfortunately due to my job amd some other factors theres absolutely no way I can go to a detox. It would cause me problems that are too big to handle so its just not an option at all.

I have 4 × 8mg suboxens, i might be able to grab a couple more. Does anyone have any advice how to home detox with the subs? I'm sure it won't be very comfortable or pleasant and I can accept that. Its the price I pay for being a fucking pathetic moron. Any help or advice you guys can give would mean the world to me! So if anyone has any advice or hints or tricks or ANYTHING to detox with suboxen at home please share it with me!! I have a good life.. I'm in an amazing relationship (she doesn't know I'm using, though I'm sure she's starting to suspect something), I have the truck of my dreams, the best dog in the world (German Shepherd rescue), a house, a GREAT job, and the best circle of friends and family a guy could ask for!! I don't want to lose ANY of that.. I'd never forgive myself.  And I don't want any of them to know I'm using again.. it would devastate them.

So any advice about detoxing with the subs would be GREAT. And definitely if you have any other tricks or tips.. any and all information will be appreciated. If you actually read all this, I love you and thank you!",2,0

I was addicted for about 15 years and taking 7-8 10mg tabs a day, every day. I took my last half pill on April 11th. 
The taper was difficult at times, especially once I got down to 3. After that, though, besides anxiety of actually being done, it went very smooth. I’m actually shocked at how “easy” it was for me after taking my very last dose. 
Now, I don’t miss them. I don’t even think about them. Once in a blue moon, I’ll get that anxious urge feeling I used to get when I was counting down the hours until my next dose, but I wouldn’t call it a craving. It’s just a sudden jolt of anxious energy, but I don’t immediately connect it to thoughts of pills and it goes away as quick as it came on. 
I’m a different person now. Completely. My brain is completely different. It’s clear. And happy. I’m at peace. I forgot what this felt like. 15 years of addiction completely took away the ability to feel true peace and joy. I have it back now and it’s wonderful. Life is good again. 

I know a lot of people say a long, slow taper is too hard. Nearly impossible, I was told. I can tell you, if it wasn’t for doing the taper very very slow, I wouldn’t have been able to get off them and rather painlessly. I also want to add, I GREATLY credit these supplements with helping me TREMENDOUSLY:

5HTP
SAM-e
Ashwagandha
L-Theanine

I've been wanting to quit, but couldn't commit until my mo., who I'm staying with, gave me a ""quit by"" date or I can't stay here anymore. I've got a week from today to get clean. So, a little incentive I guess.

Anyways, I've kicked heroin a million times (usually CT and in jail, hovering around a 1.5g habit of IV tar a day). It fucking sucks but I guess it's doable, I'll just live the next two weeks in misery I suppose. I can't sleep worth a dog shit when I'm sick and will regularly stay up for 10+ days with 0 sleep when I'm kicking. 

I moved from tye west coast to the east coast in 2018. Obviously dope is different here, this shit is fentanyl and west coast was tar heroin. I was clean for 2 years when I moved here and only took kratom. I did speed and coke and shit, but not opiates. 

Anyways, since last year when I caught my long term bf cheating on me, I've been using. A big part of me being clean was that he was terrified of me ODing as he watched his friend OD and die in front of him. So he pretty much cockblocked me from any dealers for like 2 years. Well that went out the window, he's in jail right now and went from an alcoholic cokehead to a tweaker/junkie. We always turn out our SOs, don't we.

I've been using... mm, maybe like... .3 to half a gram a day of what I suspect is extremely cut fentanyl. I went up north and got some stuff that I was told was half heroin half fentanyl and shit killed me like 4 times off a 1/4 of a point, whereas the shit in my city I regularly shoot 4x that a shot. 

I've been strung out since the end of October last year.

How bad will this be? I've got a single suboxone,  a kilo of kratom coming in the mail, and some ashwaghandha and that's literally it.",1,0

I don’t want to do my life story on my first post. I’m wondering if anyone has come across or knows of an opiates recovery Reddit for ppl in the UK?
The reason I ask is because treatment and recovery is different in each country and I’d like to start my path to recovery armed with specific knowledge about how services work in the uk. I have an oxycodone liquid addiction that started at 250mg per day. It’s prescribed by my gp. The addiction services I’ve encountered so far are mainly for street drugs and offer only methadone treatments, which I’m not sure I want to do. I don’t have £10,000 for a private rehab. I’ve been slowly tapering over the course of 2 years, but it’s killing me. 
I’m a mother of 2 children, with many chronic illnesses. Maybe there’s a Reddit for chronic illness/ addiction to prescription meds? I don’t know enough about Reddit to use it properly I think. 
All the stories I’ve read on here give me hope. I’m in genuine awe of you. If I knew how to find and buy street drugs I would be long gone by now I think. 
It’s also a good job we don’t have guns we can carry legally like in other countries because I’ve hit rock bottom many times. I’m just too cowardly and frightened of any
More pain to end things another way.
Today is the last day I ring my dr again before my script is due and beg for help. This drug has ruined my life. It’s ruined me. 
If anyone knows of any UK opiate recovery help, I would be very grateful. I really hope this is my turning point, because if it’s not, it’s definitely my end.

Wash. Rinse. Repeat. My last go was my longest clean. Almost two weeks. Been using hydrocodone the past 4-5 days again. My doc. 

Each time this happens I have gone down on my usage. Originally at almost 200mg a day. This last run was at maybe 100mg a day. 

This is nothing new. Opiates. I’ve been using for over 10 years. 

Started with hydrocodone for chronic pain.  Was clean for 1.5 years. Returned to pills. Graduated to H sniffing for 3 months and realized where it was going and got on subs for 18 months. Unfortunately had bad reaction. Liver enzymes took a shit and had horrible body swelling. Not to mention it did nothing for my pain. Got off the subs using hydrocodone and was clean for 4 months and pain took me back to the hydrocodone. 

Back to current situation. I’m so sick of this. All I do is hurt and torture myself. 

I’m lucky I work from home because I can’t miss work. But it’s still hell. Even using massive amounts of weed, gabapentin and kratom. 

I’m out again. And can’t get more for 2 weeks. But if I make it that far why do I go back again? Because I lie and believe myself. 

I’m finally ready. I feel something within myself this time that’s different. I’ve blocked all my plugs and even 2 “friends”.  The last time I did that was when I was clean on subs for 18 months. 

I know I can’t get through this pain free. But I need to function. Barely but at least to get normal household chores done and work. 

I dont know. Just rambling at this point. I get scared. Every time. I just did this a couple of weeks ago. And all I remember is how horrible it was. And this is now my 4th go in a very short time.",6,0

I’ve pretty much gone from living like a peasant in a shared accommodation to living like a prince with an en-suite bedroom in a 6 bedroom house.

My concern at the moment is that I think I'm forgetting my reasons for wanting to quit in the first place. I'm doing better in some ways but struggle with certain things such as when I get home from work. I used to take dihydrocodeine and feel instantly relaxed and play my Ps4 for a good 4-5 hours and enjoy it. Now when I get home from work I'm far too tired and disinterested to play Ps4 and just want to go straight to bed. I guess this is more normal but is it better? I also struggle with the times when I feel rubbish and achy at work (12-13 hour shifts). Again I used to take dihydrocodeine and feel instantly better although distant and  emotionless. I now just put up with feeling rubbish and get through it whilst putting on a brave face and acting more normal. Again is this better? 

All I know is that withdrawal is one very long process. Even after 7 weeks I still sometimes get the feeling in my legs and body that I need dhc to feel and become relaxed or/and energised. I'm also still struggling with energy levels and motivation. My insomnia is getting better but this is probably down to being on my feet for 60 hours a week at work. I do feel more normal and in control of my emotions, I just keep questioning certain things such as whether my lack of enjoyment and motivation is permanent without using dhc. If it is permanent, is that what I want just so I can be and feel normal? I've been single for a long time now mainly due to my problems with addiction, not just dhc but gambling also, so I guess finding a partner would help me. Easier said than done the way my life and mental health is at the moment!

I’m taking 8mg suboxone strips and unfortunately have to use the generic for the time being (alvogen).

I don’t like the strips in general bc I hate the taste, and I’m used to taking zubsolv actually. It’s minty and has a better absorption rate, amongst other benefits. 

With the zubsolv, I would let it dissolve for about 20 minutes and then swallow the saliva/buprenorphine mixture floating around in my mouth. Sometimes it would give me a slight headache though. 

My doctor said I didn’t necessarily need to swallow it all bc most of the bupe is being dissolved sublingually and that the other inactive ingredients in the medication can cause bad side effects such as headaches, nausea, upset stomach, heartburn, etc. 

With zubsolv, these side effects were very mild and I felt like I was getting a larger dose of bupe by swallowing so I always did that. With these generic sub strips though, I feel awful. I get all of the side effects mentioned above. I’m new to this medication so I wanted to ask what everyone else does. Do you swallow the spitty bupey soup or spit it out after like 20-30 mins once most of it has been absorbed?

Additionally, what do you think the difference in dosage would be (if any) by spitting rather than swallowing? I would rather spit it out, assuming I am still getting at least 80-90% of the same amount of bupe as when I swallow it all.

Fent the last 5-6. I’ve attempted to detox at least 200 plus times in the last 6 years. Specifically most of those the last 2 years. So I’ve been through it all really.  But last night. After around 55 hours in with only 3 300 mg gabs a day and one clonidine .1 mg every 12 hours. It hasn’t been to bad yet anyway. But at hour 55. When I fell asleep. ( with gabs clonidine and weed I can sleep at least a little every other hour or so at night for around 20 mins to an hour at a time). But last night. I had these dreams and it was the most fucked up shit ever. I’ve had dreams before where I’ve used and shit. But this was wild. It was literally a whole day and night ordeal of trying to get shit but not being able to. Nobody was answering. But I’d wake up. Be like man fuck. Pass back out and it would pick up in the exact same place as it left off. Shit was wild I’ve never had something like that happen. So naturally I get up for the day and it’s felt like a whole day and night trying to get shit and I literally felt all strung out from the feeling of trying and not being able to. So naturally now knowing I can make one phone call and have something within the hour it just wasn’t a good feeling for me. And it’s shitty because for being 55 hours in at that point till I got up to make it 60 hours since last use. I haven’t felt to to bad at all. I have symptoms of course. But nothing like they usually are since I finally got clonidine to go with the gabs. So it just really fucking sucks that my main battle has been not being able to be sick for a week or more. And now I haven’t felt to bad at all but I had that horrible dream that wacked me out mentally. Also sleep is
Weird detoxing. It’s insanely hard to get any but if too do man idk. It does something to you. Because I could go to sleep confident feeling like I got this just put down another day.

I woke  up on the 5th day, thinking it had been 24 hrs since my last use and I took my suboxone. Within 15 minutes I felt the withdrawals like no other, even my fingers were aching.  I quickly realized oh shit I had just used late that previous evening.  I started to panic somewhat and within an hour I was having the most vivid and terrifying hallucinations.  It felt like I was tripping but hundred times stronger, if I shut my eyes it felt like I was in water with what appeared to be bubbles swirling around each other. I started seeing faces and hearing voices.  Also my smell was off, things smelt burnt or just plain bad.  It felt like I was dying.  The hallucinations got so bad I was convinced they were real.  I called 911 and have spent the last 4 days in the hospital.  I’m just curious if anyone else has had severe hallucinations from opiate withdrawals?  I have detoxed many times but never experienced anything like this.",4,0

Some insight for all!,"I’m (34M) broke my back at 18 playing football along with many concussions So of course started down the Percocet/oxy train as prescribed but as we all know we love that high and numbness to reality. As my tolerance grew ended up in a very serious relationship in which she started getting hooked on my pills I was prescribed. By 26 I’m no longer going to docs bc the back condition I have can’t be fixed with operation and pain management was giving me everything but oxy. So that started the death ride of buying off street and by 30 I’m spending $5k a week on oxy for the both of us. 

Long story short by 33 and being engaged it just wasn’t sustainable anymore losing my business got evicted while the ex girl works as a nurse daily taking 400 mg Percocet a day at work so we fell apart all because of pills. Well for the past year got turned on to heroin. Hate needles so for the first time ever putting something up my nose and it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than oxy pills 

Here’s the lesson: started seeing psychiatrist recently and he said this: “you’ve been abusing narcotics to drown out all the pain physically and mentally like most. An escape froM reality and chemically changing your brains activity and thought process. Instead, remember the root of majority of addicts to get high, he numb to the horror and trauma of real life. So now I’m starting you on adderall and an anti depressant. Remember to think that these new scripts can help you just like illegal narcotics. They’ll change your brain chemically for the better snd you wil no longer be miserable and can focus and be energetic to change your life around. People become addicts mostly have had severe trauma in past especially at young age. These legal prescribed drugs you’ll start now
Will change your outlook on life
And maybe even never crave dope or oxy again”! THIS FELT LIKE AN EPIPHANY TO ME

3 months later I’m sober and actually happy without the thought every damn day of where and when ill get high that day. I never liked the idea of antidepressant but it’s logical these drugs change your thinking for the better and put all those terrible past trauma on the back burner. 

Just wanted to share that I got hope to succeed now snd it’s a amazing feeling to be motivated, to not
Spend thousands a week to get high just to drown out my sorrows
For a few hours. Finally addressed the root of why so many of us get addicted

I know it’s long
Story but
Maybe will be read by a member here and will change their life too

I’ve just arrived home from a very active vacation which took up most of the last week.

I’ve been pretty much symptom free for most of the last week, I definitely feel the cold more intensely than before and I’ve been physically weaker / easily tired. I’ve always been  a t-shirt and shorts guy before opioids, even in the winter but since stopping the oxy I feel the cold so much more, not an epic issue but there it is. 

My appetite came back full force around the start of the trip away and my stomach and toilet habits have been pretty much normal.

I quit the Valium 4 days ago and have slept mostly ok since then, had a restless night the first night but hadn’t been taking them that long so I think I got away with it. I am sleeping a lot lighter than before, I have this weird feeling that I haven’t slept at night because I remember being awake so much, but then I also remember really vivid dreams so I know I must have dozed off several times in the night. I wake up at the slightest noise though.

Also feeling a fair amount of anxiety today, assume it’s more to do with a lot of travel, not much sleep and stopping the Valium maybe. I have never suffered from anxiety before so it’s just a new sensation of being almost constantly on edge. But like the terrible feelings I had in early wd I’m sure this too will pass.

I have no desire to use again, just the thought makes me feel physically sick, when I think of all that discomfort and psychological pain to quit. I hope that feeling remains, I never want to go through this again.

I just want to thank everyone on this sub for their relentless positivity and support. I try to pay back where I can but this place really helped me get through the worst periods. I know I’m not out of the woods yet, physically and mentally but I have to feel proud of getting this far. Anyone going through it, you also need to feel proud, whether you are day 1 or 100 (or even day -1 wanting to take the plunge), you should be so very proud that you want to heal your body and mind from the vast damage these drugs wreak. I know my habit wasn’t as big as some but the difficulty of stopping has been real, the pain has been real and I am still waiting to feel fully like my old self, so I guess even a moderate habit can be damaging enough.

I am pondering upon whether or not my iridescent flower petals will go on to bloom, or to rot. Unfortunately, I greatly suspect the latter. How can you blame me, when everything I have touched or loved in my life has ended up turning to ash in the sweaty palms of my hands? I can’t stand to live inside my own skin, the moment the sun rises and I open my eyelids (if I was even lucky enough to close them) my essence is screaming to be let outside of the prison wrapped in my epidermis. Oh what a beautiful personification of a dramatic tragedy so willfully bitter and shameless that the protagonist has an air about her that she seems almost Shakespearean.

I have fallen in love with letting the rains of my wretched days waterlog my floral arrangements, drowning the beauty because I cannot take it. I am not comfortable amongst love and light, no something in me has grown to despise the very idea of peaceful and comfortable, healthy highs in my life. I would bury myself underground if it meant I would not have to hear the sound of my inner child’s cries.

She is scared, she is hurt, she doesn’t understand why I have cast her aside and made her feel as though she has no value, she has no worth. I regret the way I have treated her, the way I have treated myself… but to me it feels as if that is something I never could have helped. I was born into the flames of hell, and my skin has been charring on the grill for so long I forgot that burning was supposed to be torture.

So I have looked in the mirror and hated my reflection, I have relished in the notion that I will continue to spend my life scorched. It’s a choice.

It’s all been a choice all along, I understand this on a rational yet not visceral level. Truly, I am the rarest of those who could be called both genius and desperately naïve ; yes I am truly the most enigmatic of fools.

Do I deserve this? Probably not. Will I ever let go of my morbid obsession to rot?

I think I’d say it’s 50/50, - so in plain language I’d say “Maybe, maybe not.”",29,0
303,2021-06-04 23:38:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/nsms8k/cns_depressants/,CNS depressants,"Well...I am once again sober after a brief relapse that ended my longest continuous abstinence from opiates, a relatively happy period that lasted over 2 ½ years. Fortunately, my relapse was not continuous and it only lasted for about a month in total duration. I am not going to delve into the causes or circumstances around the relapse today, but instead a different topic that I have had ample time to consider as I trudge back up this steep hill to abstinence. As little as I used, this has still been really tough and it is difficult to lose control of my bodily functions, brain, life, and grasp of reality. 

&#x200B;

I have always been attracted to CNS depressants, I don’t hate other drug classes but my substance abuse issues can be narrowed down into 3 of the most recognized substances that depress the central nervous system: opiates, benzos and alcohol. Opiates come first for me because they have defined about one third of my life, not because they were unremitting, but because they have proven to be interminable. Which is a fancy way of saying that once I found opiates, they dominated both abstinent and active periods of the last decade plus, and this will probably continue perpetually until I die. As is the case with hardcore drugs of any kind: opiates, alcohol, meth, cocaine, benzos, etc. it is a blood in blood out game. The lived experiences of that decade plus will always be with me and I have yet to experience a more destructive and debilitating phenomenon in my 30 years on this earth. I’d like to point out that I chose the word phenomenon precisely because the scary thing is that we still do not have a high-level understanding of what causes addiction or even really how to explain or treat it. 

&#x200B;

Once you have been confined by the restraints of the various depths that a serious addiction will inflict upon you, that lived experience never fully goes away. There have been times in the last few years of clean time where I reflected on that period of addiction and it almost felt like I was having a brief encounter with a vivid extra sensory perception through the eyes of another human being. I did not even recognize the person that I had been during that time, it felt like the all too familiar experience of having a long-lost friend that overdosed, and the only remnants of their life on this earth are the intense memories I was experiencing as if they were my own. But of course, they were my own experiences, which were conveniently accompanied by some memories where I felt like I had a strikingly recent battle with a demon that I thought had been exorcised long ago. Which is a superfluous way of saying that a past addiction can feel really far away but also extremely close to you at all times. Said metaphorically, it is like when you burn your hand on the stove as a child, you know what that stove is capable of doing to you, you feel the phantom sensation and shudder at the thought of the burn, but you also know that it won’t happen unless you make contact with the stove. Unfortunately for this addict, he always had to touch the stove and if that action produced the same sensation that opiates did, he might not have had any hands left to type this with.

It would be natural for you, the reader, to be wondering when this stream of consciousness will end and I am here to do exactly that so let’s refocus on CNS depressants and why they are so dangerous. The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord, and is responsible for most functions of the body, in particular communication between different parts of the body. Among many responsibilities the CNS: integrates sensory information and responds accordingly via voluntary and involuntary movements (reflexes, heart beats, metabolic processes, temperature control), bowels, breathing, sensation, thought, awareness, memory, sleep, appetite, pain sensitivity, homeostasis, reproductive activity, the center for strong emotions like fear, etc. Anyone that has been through an addiction to CNS depressants can easily recognize many of these processes that go absolutely haywire while using and then the opposite reaction immediately upon cessation. There is relatively little information on how these processes are effected long-term, but the body does have a remarkable capacity for recovery and the point here is that you do too. 

&#x200B;

It can feel overwhelming at times but it has helped me to explore the processes of the CNS and in particular it helps to put into perspective why it is so mentally, physically and emotionally taxing to go through opiate addiction and withdrawals. Not to mention the long recovery process of Post-Acute Withdrawal Symptoms (PAWS) that can last up to a year or even longer in more severe cases. This is not a “Just Say NO!” scare tactic, I am only presenting this information because it helps me to put things in perspective when I am a few weeks/months sober and still not feeling right. If you aren't sick and tired of being sick and tired ignore this. It helps to put into perspective the long battle that I am fighting and how catastrophic each relapse can be for a variety of reasons, but for the purposes of this topic mainly the damage that could be done to the brain and body that is not visible and the time that is lost while battling through these various symptoms until some form of “normalcy” returns. Everyone is different, but I still hadn’t regained some of these basic functions well into the 2 plus years of abstinence I had and it is important to understand that the brain and body are not a boomerang. The constant cycle of addiction-withdrawal-recovery-relapse gets more and more difficult to bounce back from. It helps to understand that you aren’t necessarily a weak individual, but many of us are engulfed in a war that is much bigger than we consciously recognize. 

&#x200B;

So, if you are wondering why “you are like this” or why “you can’t just stop,” and it is difficult to explain to someone else or your loved ones, this would be a good place to start. Addiction is incredibly invasive and all encompassing, you temporarily (or not) lose some of the core functions of the CNS that I mentioned, but also your reward system is hijacked, and it is so insidious that a former addict’s tolerance will build much faster than someone who did not have an addiction even if both individuals are using the same amounts of a substance. In relation to opiates, they believe that your available receptors may be diminished but there is still not conclusive evidence of that. I believe this is called kindling for benzos and alcohol, which is basically that you can be sober for years and then use for a few days and be thrown into a vicious withdrawal again. Statistically we don't have great odds to recover, so I find it helpful to understand what is happening in the brain and body to appreciate any successes because they are basically against all odds. 

&#x200B;

Your brain and body used to be working to keep you alive and thriving, but years of drug addiction will turn them against you for a while and you have to struggle with that on top of cravings, relationship problems, financial issues, etc. that come with being a drug addict. So in summary, if you are in the early stages of recovery then don’t be in a rush to get better because outside of building new habits and supplementing your brain with new reward centers for those habits you can’t speed up time. Do you feel like your brain is broken? I used to sometimes, but outside of a couple cracks in the screen it still works pretty well considering it was basically dropped from a second story window repeatedly. Be patient, it is a long-haul process, you might feel like shit a couple months after getting clean but you will be happy you stuck it out in the long run and you will at least have given yourself a chance. Backwards or forwards, there is really no in between. Always remember that it is much easier to slide downhill than to climb back uphill. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes drug addiction feels like you are experiencing life as a tree growing in a backyard, you get too tall and branch out too much into neighbor's yards and you get cut down, only to thrive again the next time. Like the tree we are resilient, and will always continue to grow back, if you give yourself enough time you can bloom with the best of 'em. I see beauty and brilliance in a lot of recovery communities, if we could just stop cutting ourselves down, we could reach the sky with the tallest of the redwoods.

The last few weeks have been hell. I came up with a plan to get off the junk and got a load of pressed vallies and xanax off a pal. Both with etizolam in I believe. 

Fast forward a day and my xan plug dies. Hes a friend and has been for years now. It's been stressful dealing with it as he has no family so I'd been guzzling the blues and xans to get through and I stop taking any opiates for almost a week . In a moment of stupid ness after 4 days of hell trying to sort his death out(and we still haven't) I went and scored. 

That was saturday. Smoked a g that night then a .2 on Sunday. Then bang cut off of everything as of monday. Couldn't even get any weed. The phenibut wasnt helping although I just take a maintainence dose of a g a day until I can reduce.

I am riding it out I had a few codeine monday then Tues and I think weds. It's now Friday and I'm 48 hours clean from opiates. I have a beautiful girlfriend and a real chance at a life and I'm just fucking it up the wall with this crap that will ruin and take everything. 

I took a larger dose of phenibut today and it really helped my anxiety and muscle tension. I've done things today I haven't been able to do all week. Like write this. And eat. And walk to get a gram of weed. And talk to my girlfriend happily and my mum.

If you can trust someone to dose you instead of yourself I'd say it's a no brainer for withdrawal. Easy to pick up a habit and I may get slayed for it and will have to eat my words as I may be totally wrong but it's made my life liveable today. Which as an addict is no good as easily relied on hence getting someone else to dose you if possible.

I feel incredibly isolated though during this time as I've no access to usual support group on another social media platform due to a 30 day ban. My girlfriend is brilliant but doesn't have the experience with opiates and opiate withdrawal or recovery. Were starting to fall out as shes my only person to talk to or whinge at so I'm reaching out. 

Thanks if you read all of this. Sorry its probably convoluted full of holes and confusing as hell but I had to write some words down regarding my withdrawal from opiates and the last few weeks. And I start a new job on Monday picking and packing in a warehouse. Praying I'm feeling a lot better by then.

I never was an iV user, just the worst kind of pill popper (30 Percs a day type) and H tooter (gram daily type) for two decades. Please don’t take my addiction lightly just because I never shot. Some had this reaction when I used to attend live meetings, and it’s absolutely absurd. I can actually perform phlebotomy and I’m certified, but when it comes to my own veins? Nah...move along. 

So, I have recently accepted the fact that m-done will be something I deal with for the rest of my life and you know.... so what? It used to bother me a lot but fk it. I know myself, and the BIGGEST thing with me is just simply knowing that I’ve taken my dose this morning, and I will be ok for the day. That reassurance means so much. It’s 60/40 mental/physical for me in terms of quantifying desires. I still need to get to my correct mg’s, but this is just how things have turned out for me. I returned to school this last spring semester and have a year left before getting my BS and becoming a radiological Technician. Might seem at odds being in this field, but it’s never been a problem. Never entertained the idea of trying some crap with a doc’s scripts, as I’d be bought and sold in prison... Point being, the stretches in my life in which I have been the most successful, reliable, and effective were the times I was on the Done. 

Any others have a similar epiphany/realization ? Could be with m-done or something else. Thanks for letting me share.",7,0

I have been an on and off heroin user since I was about 15. I am going to be 25 in July. This last stretch has been for about a year, I have cut my habit down a lot since leaving my ex. I was clean before I was with him but he kept enabling me to use due to me paying for his habit and him not wanting to get clean. I had zero support.. now I am dating the most amazing guy. He isn’t stupid, he knows I use and he wants me to stop and I do as well more than anything. I don’t even like using heroin to be completely honest. I only do it so I won’t get sick. I buy a quarter every time I pick up, this last one lasted me 10 days (how much would that be a day? 6 grams over the course of 10 days?) 
Anyway - this next week I am going to do it. I’m not letting this shit ruin my life any longer. I wish for nothing more than to wake up in the morning, have energy and not have to get up and go straight to use. If anyone has some good tips I would really appreciate it. I am going to do it this time, I know I am stronger than this drug and it’s power over me. I let myself get so down that I even allowed myself to use a drug like this. It’s not me, it’s not what I want for my life. I feel like I have made my life so good this year so far and the last thing I need to kick out now is this. Thank you for reading everyone. Also how bad do you thinking my w/d will be? I am 5’2 110lbs if that makes a difference

Hearing the clinking of the chains of my own creation, I have walked slowly, slowly (slowly). I have suffered greatly, at the hands of that which is wicked, and clever, and so beautiful I spent what feels like forever defending my right to life imprisonment.

I have been trying, considering, and often failing to make an appeal to the courthouse judge inside my own psyche, as if dreaming I could one day be free would ever get me there. Dreaming in a concrete box just serves to heat the square confines, the humidity of my tepid (once incandescent) mind refuses to evaporate, and so this abstract slice of time and space where I have laid for three hundred thousand days is so sticky with the hydrogen of my wasted dreams that I have done nothing but marinate.

Oh, make no mistake, what I have felt and traded for this fool’s gold kind of grace- you would never want a taste. I implore you that infinity is not a concept that goes well with humanity, and I always say I am not from Earth (but I am flesh, just the same).

The whir of wasted youth, the dissonant cadence of my shameless tumble into chemical abuse… it is not a tune that I care to share with you.

What I care to share with you, is how I plan to make the greatest of all prison breaks. If I were left to leave my fate in the hands of that which is greasy ebony, I know I would only ever continue to wish my soul would actively evaporate. I do not plan to ask the Dope-partment of Infections for my freedom, no that’s something I could never ask for- it is something I must take.

Good thing I hid a nail file in my cell all these years, even if I nodded out so long I think I forgot it even existed, even if I never thought I’d have the strength to use it. And so I start sawing at these iron chains. It is tedious, grievous work (God, how the metal pressed against my skin bleeds and hurts) but I just grit my teeth and remember that these are not chains that I deserve.

I do not deserve to be shackled, tied to my misery. I deserve a window at least… no actually I deserve to bask in the daises, to let the sun tan my haggard and cold, cold skin after a decade in captivity.

It is wretched work. My wrists are starting to hurt ‘till I think the marrow inside my body is bound to be what swiftly breaks.

That doesn’t happen. I hear the clink of silver clatter down to the stone floor.

I look around, some way, somehow I am standing on grassy, sunlit ground. I am running through fields of lavender roses, I am bathing my soul in the scent of bright yellow posies

There are still red and purple bruises, from all of the years I spent in chains. But they will heal and fade, as things always do within this peculiar manifestation of the intangible concept of time and space.

What will not fade is what I have learned from the time I spent shackled, caged, and chained, and it is quite a long list of lessons, but I can condense the theme of all of it, and sum it up like this: 

Good riddance.",11,1

My boyfriend of 3 years also struggles. We've always talked about how much we wanted to get clean and have a family together.well, I found out I was pregnant in December and decided to go to treatment at the Swedish hospital in seattle. There they treat you with methadone and while I was there my boyfriend said he was going to get on suboxone. He has a clinic to go to for it called sound treatment solutions, but the whole time I was gone, 28 days, he hadn't done what he said he was going to do. Well I'm out of treatment since April 12 and I've been on the methadone program and it's actually been helping me..I had my boyfriend also join this methadone program
 But he doesn't seem to be taking it seriously. At all. He keeps shit talking the program and his councelors and always saying he's not gonna go dose for the day. He is still using which in term makes me wanna use too..I try to get up to dose every morning at the clinic but I am so tired all all time.He's up in the morning way before I am and I keep telling him to please wake me up when he does so I don't miss dosing times(last time to dose is at noon) but even though he's awake he never gets me up when I accidentally sleep through my alarm and I miss dosing for the day, and he is still just using and will actively use right in front of me and it makes me want to use too and I feel like even though he is very active with the pregnancy and being there for the ultrasounds and acting like everything's okay,he is not taking this as seriously as I thought he would.. if I have this baby and there's anything else in my system other than methadone cps will take  the baby..I've dealt with this before. I was in an abusive relationship while actively using and got pregnant and couldn't get help cause ex held me hostage cause he thought I would call police on him. and lost my first child to cps.. I wasn't going to make the same mistake and got help immediately when I found out I was pregnant because I've always wanted to be a mother and need to redeem myself.. but I feel like the father of the baby is holding me back..he doesn't want to get clean..he has a child of his own and I don't think he truly knows the consequences of using while pregnant..I don't want to experience what I experienced with my last child..he's now happily adopted with a great family..but it leaves me with so much regret and pain I don't want to experience again.ive expressed this with my boyfriend who keeps saying he understands but is doing nothing to help the situation. Nothing to help me to stay clean or get himself cleaned up. I understand that it's hard to get Clean without treatment but like he's not even trying to go up on his dose which in term is not even doing anything to curb his cravings. And as much as I want to stay clean..it's so hard when you're around someone who is using right In front of you. What do I do?",3,0

 Then the last 6 days I'd say I've taken about 1 and a half of the 10mg oxys. It's been everyday since May 3rd. So about 31 days. 

I usually only was taking them between like 1030am &9pm at work. 

I've gone through withdrawals like 2 years ago for a similar usage but it was a year long use. That actually wasnt horrible I took Kratom and xanax for it. I'm prescribed xanax and clonidine which help. I just want to know what I should expect consider the low dose and length.

My original dose up until 15 days ago was 1.5 Tsp 4 to 6 times per day Every 3 to 4 hours. 15 days ago I went from 1.5Tsp to 1Tsp and continue to take it at my regular times througout the day. The first 3 days or so I was somewhat sensitive to temperature but nothing that wasnt unbearable.

I plan to stay on the. 75Tsp every 3 to 4 hours for no more than 2 more weeks.

For 2 week while being completely clean before Kratom I got maybe 16 to 19 hours in 2 weeks of sleep due to restless legs spasming right before I would fall asleep. If anyone has any suggestions as to what I could do about restless legs please let me know. My advice to people tapering down or cutting off is to stay active.

Just a bit of background, been using on and off (but mostly on) since I was 19, I'm now 33. At my peak I was doing 400-600mg of codeine, twice a day. Anyway, I've managed to get this down (over a period of years) to 120mg a day and introduced abstinence periods between having more but usually no more than a month. Usually 2 weeks on and about 4 off. 

Each and every month I've been in WDs and they have for the most part been the same as you would expect, even by the end of a month, I've always found myself still experiencing a few symptoms (sweating, restless legs and chills). This most recent episode though has been a strange one, I am on day 25 of no codeine and I have had only very very mild WDs on days 6-9. Before day 6 and from day 10 it has all felt rather normal. I know codeine isn't anywhere near as bad in terms of withdrawal when compared many other opiates/oids but it feels like a really strange WD to have? I've been using the same way for 2-3 years now and the WDs have always been the same. Has anyone else ever had this? 

Still, nearly a month now, let's see what 2 months feels like!

Before this I was clean for over a year. I’m trying to get off this time without alerting the parents bc I can’t put them through this again; and I don’t they could handle it. 

So I am on day 4 of my custom Bernese suboxone induction process. My doses are a bit higher than recommended on this subreddit, but I’ve seen several studies online that more closely resemble my schedule. Here is my plan for the week:

Day 1 ) 12:45pm ( .25mg)

Day 2) 11:00am (.25mg) / 6pm (.25mg)

Day 3) 11:00am (.5mg) / 6pm (.5mg)

Day 4) 11:00am (1mg) / 6pm (1mg)

Day 5) 11:00am (2mg) / 6pm (2mg)

Day 6) 11:00am (3mg) / 6pm (3mg)

Day 7) 11:00am (4mg) / 6pm (4mg)

Today is the first day I am starting to notice the subs/lack of full agonist in my system. Very mild symptoms, but I had a headache, nausea, temperature fluctuations, anxiety, inability to eat, and just an overall feeling of weakness, sort of like I had a weighted blanket draped over me. I’ve also noticed that using the same amount of dope I normally use is having less and less of an effect. I’m not really getting high anymore, just trying to maintain a sense of normalcy. 

Tomorrow I have to go in public and also do a bit of physical exercise (no way to get out of it). I’m worried what tomorrow will feel like, especially because it will be my largest jump up in dosage in a single day so far. I don’t think I will go into full blown PWD, but I’m scared shitless that I will feel awful while I am out doing what I have to do tomorrow. 

Does anyone have any experience with an induction process this aggressive? How am I going to feel tomorrow? Should I repeat day 4’s dosage again on day 5 just to be careful? Or perhaps only increase my dosage to something like 1.5mg twice a day? Or can I just do a little extra dope tomorrow or something to avoid any discomfort? 

I really need to power through this induction process since I am quickly running out of dope (and don’t want to get more) and also have a family trip planned in just under 2 weeks that I was hoping to be clean for or at least stable on subs by that time. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks y’all.",1,0

      I started methadone at 24 . I was IV diluadids about 10 a day (8mg) .plus h and fet. For 3 years off and on before I got on methadone . 

They started me at 30 and shot me up at 125mg really fast . I would still feel chills the next morning or before bed . So I never thought I was stable . 

 I wanted to get off cause all my friends are on it for 1 year then it’s 2 then it’s 10 years later . 
  
I didn’t want that to be me .... so I dosed down around 75 mg and stayed for one year and stabilized. I switched clinics and they put me on a slow taper at 1 mg every few months or so .  so slow that in 2 years I was at 56 mg . 

I was fed up . I started drinking lots of water taking magnesium, DLPA , working out . My motto was to stay out of bed . (Didn’t work all the time lol) 

I started saving my take homes . I’d get 14. (At one point 1 56 mg bottle lasted me 7-8 day) 
  So I started my own taper .

(over the course of 4 months it could be longer for others I just did this according to my body and how I felt . )

So the taper from 56 on my own .....

   I took a huge syringe and measured my doses .  Came out to 14 cc
First few days I’d take the syringe and squirt it into a mason jar then put it in fridge.

After I felt my body could handle it, I would dose down bit.By marking the syringe either a sharpie from doses before and pulling past that mark . 

I wish I kept better track of doses and days . 

But now the withdrawal while dosing down . 

I’d feel good for half the day and go down hill , have to sleep in show . Sleep was 2 hours a night with 5 min naps hear and there .. It was rough and not easy at all . I had to buy a kiddie pool to sleep in at night . It was rough . I knew I needed help. And fast .

My mother being Jewish has many awesome connections. So she got a family doc to Bring me a ton of gabapentin . He said he would help my withdrawals with a 14 day plan but I had to jump off at 1 mg until then I’m on my own ..  by then I was at like 10 and over two weeks I got to 1 . This total taper to 56  took me 4 months , it could take another years.


Day 6 .So I’m in bed slept good last night.  
Hope I sleep well tonight.

I'm a big fan of Nietzsche and whenever I've been clean for a while I have an enormous amount of control over my mind, but when I get too deep into this drug specifically I always seem to lose that voice that's me. At best, my thoughts are an emasculate version of myself, and at worse, they're a demon with Broca's syndrome. I could really use some advice from somebody who's experienced this.",1,0

i can’t even get up. I’ve been staying with my mother and sister in Texas to help me detox. The plane ride here was beyond a nightmare.. 

Everytime I get up I nearly faint. I fainted a couple hours ago and had to crawl to the couch and have been bed ridden since. 

Last night was the worst night of my life. The worst RSL I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t stop shaking my legs, arms, & kept getting up even though I was exhausted but eventually was able to sleep after a couple prayers.

Today the RSL has resided quite a bit but I haven’t been able to get up & move around ever since I got up earlier. Just a complete lack of energy & fear of fainting upon standing up.

I’m going to keep trying to use kratom but I’m not sure if it’s been helping.",37,0

I don’t want to go to my doctor for help and I don’t want to take suboxone. I had a positive pregnancy test yesterday and am 4 weeks along. Problem is I was using 1-2mg per day of dilaudid without knowing I was pregnant. I’m 39 years old and my husband and I have talked about having another one day but not like this. I stopped using immediately and it’s been 2 days and the withdrawal is killing me but I will tough it out.  I’ve read numerous studies saying that brain development begins in the 3rd week and that there are long term behavioral and developmental consequences if opiates are taken early in the first trimester. Also risk of birth defects. I’m terrified that I’ve already hurt my baby and now I’m struggling with whether or not I should keep it. I want to but I’m worried of the damage I have caused. With either decision, I won’t be able to forgive myself. So I suppose my question is, has anyone had experience with taking opiates early in pregnancy then stopping cold turkey? How are your children today? Any issues with behavior, learning, development, etc? I know every person and pregnancy is different. I think I’m just grasping for straws at this point. Thank you for any feedback.",2,0

1. He used Thursday ( oxy) not sure how much 
2. used Friday I’m thinking    2 - 30mgs
3. Saturday   4 - 30mgs
4. Sunday   2 - 30mgs ( which had him on his ass with the cops finding him in his car - no dui - & slept for 20 hours) 
5. Monday.  3 - 30mgs.


He claims it was only 3 days, but I know what I know. He also truly believes he is fine and he just had a little hurrah for the weekend, back to work today, no harm no foul, no more oxy. This is a chronic opiate user whose done serious time for opiates. Used opiates everyday for 2 years then was good for 4 months... 

Is it safe to say he’s going to be hurting? Or he’s basically back to being on drugs? Or is it honestly possible for a chronic opiate user to just use for a few days and stop?",5,0

For starters, I obviously knew my gf and I were having our first child when I relapsed. I made the decision last Tuesday to go to detox so that I could be sober for the birth of my son. I left detox Sunday, expecting to have a few more weeks until he came. Well, he came two days later. 

You all know how the feels hit you in early sobriety. Witnessing the birth of my son on top of that, wow. Incredible. I cried more today than I probably have in the past five years combined. I feel so blessed. So grateful. Most of all, I don’t feel the mental obsession any longer. In this moment, it seems as though it was stripped from me (I’m not that naive to believe it won’t come back, but wow, what a feeling.)

They always say you have to do it for yourself and not others, but fuck that. Last week I wanted to be sober just to see my son born and feel all those emotions. Now, he’s given me the desire to want to be clean for me, so I can be a man and father to him.

I just needed to get this out there and out of my head. Stay blessed, and stay safe, my friends.",16,0

I cut it down to 40mg daily every other day - I take 40mg, 20mg, 40mg.. it's very hard for me honestly and when I take only 20mg, I'm very emotional and tired. I finally got the motivation to quit and I'm happy about it. I take Oxycodone Sandoz 40mg ER (can be split in half).
The problem is - I can't split those 20mg's to let's say 10mg's so they stay ER. I can't just jump from 20mg's straight to zero - I got a job and need to stay okay because of my girl.

I’m going through withdrawal properly for about the third time. The first time was hell and the second time wasn’t too bad.

I’m about 36 hours in and don’t feel too bad - just a bit flat and foggy. I know it’s only early days, so I was just wondering what I should expect from here? The anxiety is usually the biggest killer for me. 

My habit was about 60mg of oxy a day for about 4-5 months, but in that time I had about 3 tea breaks that usually lasted 48-72 hours.

I genuinely want this to be the last time I do this and go back to life without these things, so any advice or help would be really appreciated :)

Always saying I'm an alien, what is the Plutonian version of Kryptonite? Toxic memories sure cut like an enchanted blade of pain. The end of post acute withdrawals is nowhere in sight... but you wanna know what is? The call of the circus lights, how in my own morbidity I found such self-masochistic delight.

I'm not fine, and they all say I will be, they all say that they believe in me... but really? It's frightening to even believe I could have lasting recovery... because that means I have to say goodbye, to deafen my ears to the call of the sirens, and close my eyes to the beams of quickly fading light.

I'll grit my teeth though, every time the insincerity streaks by in shades of lilac. I'll dig my nails into my skin, and remember the dead look in my eyes. I'll breathe in, then out, and then in again, and it will only ever be oxygen. The wrath of dope, the fallacies... I will never let them win again. 

I will not get on that wicked ride, I won't relapse for the umpteenth time, because even though I'd be telling tall tales if I said I did not want to take another spin... dip my toes into the underworld just \*one more time...\*

I will not allow myself, because I know all of the beautiful shades of magenta, Kelly green, and indigo, they're just a trap that's been set to lead me straight back to where all of the wickedness resides...

Yes, I think I really know by now that my disease is \*only ever, always and forever... telling me nothing but the most gorgeous of lies.\*

hope you liked it, hope no one minds my posting style here. it's honestly just the only way i know how to communicate my emotions cohesively and clearly. also I have 15 days today! so that's a great delight. hope everyone is well, and if you're not i hope you get welll, soooner than soon.",11,0
