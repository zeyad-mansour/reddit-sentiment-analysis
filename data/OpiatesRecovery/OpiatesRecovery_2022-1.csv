I try to get some cardio exercise in when I can which helps, but after a couple of hours I feel the fog come back in.

Has anybody tried nootropics or any other supplements to combat this a bit? I used to dabble with the racetam's to help with studying. Just wondering if anybody has any success stories with combatting the brain fog even just a little bit.",5

I know more about stimulants and psychedelics than opiates. While I know I'll be learning about them in my training/study, I'm of the conviction that -- other than alcohol -- the opiate crisis is the biggest drug problem the public faces: so I'm interested in knowing right away about the medications that are used to help individuals get off of opiates. 

Can any of you share the specific medication (Suboxone, Naloxone, etc) you were prescribed; the ratio it was supposed to substitute for H, etc. for; and the 'ween off' plan/schedule that was part of your treatment plan? Any personal experiences providing information that will help me get a picture of how Subs etc. are used in treatment would be a great help in advancing my knowledge base. Thanks!

Anyone on here taking the two meds together? Not to sound rude but I'd really appreciate responses from personal experience. I debate every morning to take the Wellbutrin and just haven't followed through.

Can you tell me your experiences on these meds?

Edited to add my only experience with seizures has been after heavy benzo use/withdrawal. I'm not epileptic or anything like that.",2

Additionally I can only share what I know (or have been told), which I realize is likely only part truth, if that. 

A close family member of mine has been struggling with opioid addiction for the past 10 years. After five years of ‚Äòcasual‚Äô use (snorting pills), they OD‚Äôd which led to rehab. After rehab they moved to a halfway house before living on their own and holding down a job for the next few years. 

After rehab they‚Äôd been using prescribed methadone or suboxone or a combination of both. They‚Äôre also prescribed a combination of methylphenidate and alprazolam. In the past year they have tried to ween themselves off of the methadone/suboxone due to the fact that they felt like they were stuck in life and hoped being off the meth/subs would lead to greener pastures. 

That unsurprisingly wasn‚Äôt they case as they‚Äôre now struggling with alprazolam addiction. In the midst of all this, they‚Äôve had issues with medication access due to moving states to live with other family members.

Throw in heaps of stolen money, destroyed property, endless lying, potential mental illness, etc. and I‚Äôm sure this story may sounds like many of yours of your loved ones. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, can someone live out their life in recovery while still being prescribed other (not harmless) medications? Are you or do you know someone who has gotten off suboxone/methadone? I so so so badly want to see this person find health and happiness and success, but I‚Äôm afraid their rock bottom has yet to come. 

Hoping I didn‚Äôt break any rules here. Thanks.",3

I found out about 6 months ago that he was addicted to Percocet. I know it was wrong of me but I went through his phone. He then told me it was my fault that I‚Äôm now apart of this, when I feel that I should have been at least told about this earlier on. I understand it‚Äôs not easy but we both heavily emphasize honesty in our relationship. After finding that out, I was devastated BUT I didn‚Äôt over react. I comforted him and didn‚Äôt judge. I was just very concerned, of course. 

Over the next 6 months, we established boundaries that didn‚Äôt really hold up. He never said he was going to get help, only that he can do it on his own. Disclaimer: he doesn‚Äôt think he fully has a problem because he only takes once (60-70mg) every other week, which has increased from his once per month use earlier on. I would ask him to tell me how much and when he was taking them. I don‚Äôt know what that did for me, maybe it was safety and comfort of at least knowing. I realize I enabled his behavior a lot. He was fine with being around me high, which is when we got into fights the most. He doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a different person on them and maybe it is in my head but he isn‚Äôt the person I fell in love with. 

We currently don‚Äôt live together, so I told him I don‚Äôt want to be around him high and that he needs to get help. Obviously, that can only last so long of us being separate while he‚Äôs on it since we‚Äôll be moving in together in the summer. I‚Äôm at a complete loss, I‚Äôm drained and everything I read to educate myself just tells me to get out or stick around if they‚Äôre willing to get help.

I know every place is different. Most hospital psychiatric wards can be pretty brutal places, but if you show and treat people with respect, that's generally what you'll get back. I (just now) went to go get a nicotine lozenge, and the nurse who gave it to me thanked me for my kindness and appreciation. That honestly made me feel really good about myself, especially in a time where I'm self loathing a ton.

Point I'm trying to make is, if you show respect, you get respect in return. Especially in situations like an inpatient unit. It can be hard when in withdrawal, with emotional regulation going all over the place. I know what emotional irregularities feels like. Where I'd blow up at the slightest thing like someone opening a bag of chips around me. Would just scream a bunch, punch holes in walls, etc. But as long as you explain yourself, and make it known that you're trying your best, that's all that matters. At least in settings like this, something like that can be addressed accordingly with whatever doctor is seeing you.

Stay safe guys, and keep on with the recovery. It's a really, really rough time for *everyone* right now. Know you're not in this fight alone, and that there are resources out there for help.

Like cause otherwise I'd need to wait 3 days while sick, before I can take the sub, but what if I took it to get it all out of my system and then took the subs like normal to have them work the way they should?

I don't want to induce pwds though only to be ridiculously sick for 2-3 days anyway. I'd rather slide down if it will be the same time frame.

But I want to get on subs as soon as possible so if I can induce Pwds and then use the subs as normal, and have it only take like 12 hours or so, I want to do that. Because I need to be ""normal"" by Sunday

Edit: I guess the options I've been looking at is:

Precipitate withdrawals to theoretically take all opioids off receptors (putting me at day 3 of withdrawals immediately instead of waiting) and hopefully be able to take subs again in 24hrs without making it worse, and have the sub actually make me feel better. Having kratom and benzos on hand to get through that 24 hours.


Take tiny amounts of sub every 1-2 hours building it up in my system. So basically like a slow pwds induction? Seems like it would take longer and I'm trying to get through this in 2 days really (I know it's wishful thinking, but at least feeling semi normal in that time frame is the goal)


No sub and only kratom and benzos until 48 hours and then hope and pray the sub doesn't destroy me when I have to get up in front of people and act like I'm not sick when they also already know my past use

For about 15+ years I was pretty hardcore drug abuser (lI loved all the party drugs) but opiates were the love of my life.

I spent well over a decade fighting heroin /benzo addiction. I had a 3-4 year stint of pretty full on daily addiction.

I got clean by leaving my city and moving to a remote village in the middle of NOWHERE! I thought it was the solution. Obviously I got habited up again pretty quickly and spent the next 8 years in a cycleof getting clean, relapsing, staying sober for weeks/months then relapsing again. I even moved countries but obviously my problems followed me same as before.

Usually my times of sobriety were just substituting opiates with unhealthy quantities of alcohol/ pills/ benzos etc.  For this period of 15+ years I never really lived life sober. I never went to bed without substances in my body.

And to be honest I never really desired to be completely free. Sure there were times I wanted off the gear and got clean and substituted it for something else, but nothing filled the void like opiates.

Long story short, after a few attempts in detox clinics and residential rehabs, the last one lasting for 15 months where I still relapsed within 24 hours of leaving, (although I did have a desire to change).

I sorted myself out pretty quick and got myself on a Suboxone/Benzo script which I‚Äôve been on for the last 10 years now .Ive only relapsed once during the whole 10 years and it was just the once.

I now have a good Job, wife with three kids and can honestly say I am not the same person as before.

It‚Äôs ALMOST like my previous life of habit/ rattle / rinse and repeat is like a distant memory.

I know its a very real part of my life but I fell I‚Äôve moved on. In fact id go so far as to say I KNOW I‚Äôve moved on. I no longer desire to be controlled by any substance.

I did manage to taper down my subs from 16mg to 2mg a few times but always found myself jumping back up to 6-8mg

Ive been steady on 6-8mg subs, 40mg valium/ zolpidem /gabapentin for the last 6-7 years now (no more Xanax, mirtazapine etc)

Id love to kick both the Subs and benzos. The zolpidem I don‚Äôt even bother with much.

Every time I get down to 2mg subs I start to freak out a bit. Similarly I can taper down to 15/20mg valium if I want to .

I just want a clear head, and the ability to live life with my family without the need for medication. I believe Subs filled a very important substitute in my life, i wouldn't be here without them, but now its time for true freedom. 

Any advice would be welcomed.",3

This may be a winded post but I need to vent and get this out and see what type of advice i can get. So here my story in the past 3 years

So after 9 years of addiction going back and forth on opiates like oxy,heroin,opanas to subs to 10-60 days clean back to opiates then back on subs..then tried being prescribed subs which led to my largest relapse of a 6 month H binge bc I was scared id never come off sub as crazy as that sounds (you can‚Äôt sustain a life on heroin so I knew I‚Äôd fall to my knees and it took 6 months of daily use) you get the picture..vicious cycle.

Anyway I went to rehab and got clean January 23rd of 2019‚Ä¶this past 23rd would have been my third year but I relapsed.  Life was tough clean but I felt like I had beaten it.  After just under a year and the most depressing month of my life (December 2019) I met a girl, got a job, and had set up a lease to move out in March pre covid. My gf was amazing she got me this little chip even tho I don‚Äôt go to AA/NA for my 1 year and I knew she was the one‚Ä¶.she is not an addict btw and I wanted that way I wanted to be as far away from drugs as I could get.

After my 30th bday in august of 2020 I tried Kratom.  All these local pantrys near me started stocking them and I didn‚Äôt touch them the first time I noticed but one day I felt depressed and wanted them and I succumbed to it.  I got super high off opms gold extract and at that point I knew that down the road this would not be good.  I woke something up in my brain. I started very casually using Kratom sometimes I‚Äôd go a full month or more but summer of 2021 I relapsed on 30s.  They are so expensive now that even a rich person couldn‚Äôt sustain the addiction.

Anyway..even with that I was able to stop and get back to normal where I‚Äôm not withdrawaling physically but mentally I was going downhill fast until one bender in July was long enough where I felt like I needed subutex and I knew a guy (who I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to meet or know he had these things).  I eventually purposely cut him off and would want to see a doctor myself later on.

Long story short I used them under my gfs nose a lot, tried to get off but relapsed on pills again and realized I had spent a ridiculous amount of money in such a short period of time.  She then caught me and we are still struggling with trust because of it.  I was lost, almost suicidal.  Didn‚Äôt really care at that point about possibly seeing a doctor to be on subutex to attempt to go through life and my job (which I‚Äôm not doing well in and haven‚Äôt been since covid seemed to bring out my lazy tendencies and I took advantage.  Also I just do not like the job it‚Äôs not me and I don‚Äôt want to be in sales I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing and I don‚Äôt think I want to be in this anymore but I went to college for which led me in a series of random jobs which led me to this and I don‚Äôt really have any idea where else I would go with my career and it‚Äôs really hard to make a change when you know you‚Äôd have to start all over.  I don‚Äôt have any particular skills and don‚Äôt hold a passion for anything either so it makes it really difficult to change when you‚Äôre feeling comfortable at your job and have learned in the past that the grass isn‚Äôt always greener when it comes to starting all over just based on your previous work experience and throwing your resume out there‚Ä¶another very depressing feeling when you‚Äôre looking for a job you don‚Äôt even really care about just want someone to hire you so you can be independent and start bringing in enough to live on your own. 

Honestly this is part of the reason I started using drugs to begin with my identity is so fucked up I don‚Äôt know how I can be useful in this world and once the high of having a gf And moving into my own spot and getting this job wore off that‚Äôs when things got dicey.  Even though I was only using for a couple months it was too long and I was getting too sick to white knuckle

Mistake or no?  about 3 weeks  ago I decided to see a doctor to get subs and despise sub doctors with a passion bc  they are money grubbing assholes that think they know best without even getting to know a patient.  I wrote something about this and they haven‚Äôt changed at all since then and that was over four years ago.  This whole thing is a racket with the subs doctors none of them take insurance you have to pay cash and they just take your money and give you dependent drugs and hope you stay a customer indefinitely it makes me sick to my stomach when I really think about it.  Honestly it was easier on my mental to just see my subutex dealer rather than do it this way but like I said earlier I cut him off by basically making him never want to serve me again to get him outta my life and it worked but you know these doctors are right there waiting for a new broken customer to walk into the door and hand them cash.  Might as well be the fuckin plug. 

Anyway, I know if I keep doing this that they will become very difficult and length to come off of and more importantly probably permanently change my brain chemistry to worse than it was before I even got clean and idk if I can handle the thought of that especially if I‚Äôm still miserable and not thriving in any other areas of my life.  My plan was to focus on my job and other areas and not worry about the getting clean part right now bc I don‚Äôt have the time or motivation to do it without checking into a facility for atleast 30 days.  I‚Äôm terrified I will wind up being a 50 year old miserable fuck dependent on my subs (if I can even still get them)  hating my life wanting to die especially because I‚Äôm almost there now.  The part that kills me is I feel like I had it beat and was never gonna have to deal with this again and here I am!  and that causes me to wake up every morning with regret I can‚Äôt even look my at myself in the fucking mirror anymore I hate myself for what I did.

So at this point I‚Äôve almost been on subs straight for about 5 months even thought I just decided to the doctor about just under a month ago.  Time is ticking and my brain needs this now I‚Äôm totally dependent and my tolerance to them is going up.  I was actually feeling high off them 3 months ago and I no longer am.  sometimes I just want to die when I think about it too much and plot how I‚Äôm gonna get right again so at times it seems easier to just wake up and do my subs and go about my day but eventually it might just catch up with me like it did the first time I tried to do this before my biggest worst relapse of all and I can‚Äôt help but think I‚Äôm heading in that direction or just a miserable person who‚Äôs stuck on his unwanted medication feeling like a useless sheep if I continue to do this.  

I also didn‚Äôt mention that in the beginning of these five months of sub usage I was taking a minimal dose 2 mg tops and now I‚Äôm up to about six to eight mgs and I also asked the asshole doc to give me subutex thinking he would say no and of course he said yes and of course I‚Äôm snorting them because a sub is a sub to me even though I know this method is more detrimental to me and my future in my mind it‚Äôs like hey if you‚Äôre on em you‚Äôre on em.  If you‚Äôre dependent you‚Äôre dependent and if you have em you might as well get some sort of recreational feeling from them. 

All I know is I‚Äôm filled with regret on a daily basis as soon as my head gets off the pillow and I‚Äôm completely lost.. I could lose my girl, my place, and my job‚Ä¶all the things I got back 1 year into being clean .. it was like after I got that year it wasn‚Äôt as important to me.  I stopped keeping it close to me.  It didn‚Äôt matter to me anymore that I was clean I wasn‚Äôt proud anymore and had all these other areas I wasn‚Äôt doing as well as I wanted to in which was taking over me.  I still felt lost as a human, useless, and living a life like being on a rudderless ship.  

I had a goal and that was to be over a year clean by my 30th birthday and I was 1 year and 6 months clean by my 30th bday.  Sadly I ruined everything bc I‚Äôm fuck up. I‚Äôm pretty lost and any advice you could give me I‚Äôd appreciate it‚Ä¶

Also it‚Äôs important to note that my gf and I have been having problems on both ends and same thing with my job and my father.  Always had problems with my father he expects too much of me and it was never enough.  He‚Äôs also very controlling and basically pointed his finger and said if you‚Äôre not gonna choose your direction to go in at after highschool then I will.  And of course I listened bc in my mind I had no other direction to go in.  

But I love my girl and I she has stuck with me this long despite not trusting me and catching me red handed so I don‚Äôt think I need to necessarily let her go(she might let me go first) but I do think to get clean and stay clean I have to start all over again and get out of this career.  How crazy is it that this would be the third job I went on medical leave with and I‚Äôm scared what the future holds it‚Äôs not like I have a path or Direction I really want to go in I mean I like sports and I like Exercing so maybe I need to find a way to monetize that. 

What do you think? Please, I need as much advice as I get on this this is a really crucial moment life.  It‚Äôs hard for me to over guilt and regret about this past years fuck ups and decison making.  My initial thought was well the subs should help me but if I‚Äôm gonna get out I need to get out sooner rather than later but to me it‚Äôs not that simple. Last time subs eventually left me in despair feeling stuck which led to a long winded H relapse and I‚Äôm afraid this time around it‚Äôs gonna be even worse and I‚Äôm not gonna be able to handle it and I‚Äôm really gonna fall of the deep end and maybe even do something really bad that really ruins my life and then I might just have to kill myself. 

Sorry for the longest post I‚Äôve ever written.

UPDATE: 1/28/22 

You wanna hear something crazy that just happened to me today? (the day after I wrote this post or really the same day really bc I posted this at 1:30 am) My boss called me and said ‚Äúwe have to let you go‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it.  It seemed so sudden and unwarranted and came out of nowhere.  No warning no probation period not even anything negative for him to say prior to this call.  I mean I can believe it bc I bc I didn‚Äôt have too many results to show for the 2 years I‚Äôve been w the company but this was our 3rd sales meeting in 2 years !! Other sales jobs have meetings every week.  My manager quit the week after he hired me so I never had any real management or mentorship or help on my territory, but it just sucks bc now i can‚Äôt go on medical leave even if I wanted to.  Maybe I can utilize what‚Äôs left bc I do have insurance until the end of February.  The good news in the whole thing I talked about is know I have to start all over to get right so maybe this is what I needed. At the same time it‚Äôs terrifying bc like I said I don‚Äôt know really what direction to go in and I‚Äôm not young anymore I‚Äôm 31 so going back to school and trying to use my scrambled eggs brain to get another degree seems unlikely although it‚Äôs possible but I‚Äôd really just like to own a business.

Also my boss(who is a nice guy) said he would write a letter of Recommendation for me if I need it.  So although I almost started cursing him out for not warning me of being fired, I realized it was justified and I deserve to be fired and I couldn‚Äôt make the decision to get out bc I‚Äôm too much of an indecisive coward so he made it for me.  Sounds like it could be destiny, but was this meant to be?  He is also willing to say I was laid off so that I can get unemployment so although now i am completely anxious and feel like a complete loser I also feel some weight off my shoulders bc now I have an open lane to nip this in the bud before too much time goes by and next thing you no I‚Äôll be stuck in a career I hate, addicted to maintenence meds I don‚Äôt want to be on, and angry and bitter taking it out on the People I love who will eventually cut me off and I‚Äôll be even worse.

Now I just need to figure out how to execute this getting better part but it has to be quick decisions I can‚Äôt lay around the house and do nothing or I will wind up even worse.  With this info at hand, any added advice? Thanks.",0

I'm fairly new to Reddit as a whole. I wanted to share a little of my story and in return see if anyone has helpful thoughts or feedback as I begin my Suboxone induction.

After using heroin daily (iv and intramuscular) for a few years, I've finally sought the help of a doctor to get clean. He had me do a urinalysis and said that in addition to opiates I also tested positive for fentanyl. According to the doctor, fentanyl takes longer to leave one's system than heroin. So instead of using the COWS scale and waiting approx 24 hrs until I reached a certain threshold to begin my Suboxone induction, he recommends pursuing a microinduction strategy. The strategy is as follows:
Day 1- 0.5 mg daily 
Day 2 ‚Äì 0.5 mg BID 
Day 3- 1 mg BID 
Day 4 ‚Äì 2 mg BID
Day 5- 3 mg BID 
Day 6- 4 mg BID 
Day 7 ‚Äì 12 mg or 8 mg BID.

He also mentioned that for the first few days I can continue to use, albeit at smaller doses than before. So I'd be tapering off the drug while ramping up on Suboxone. I was told to not use any drugs after Day 4 or 5. 

Does anyone have experience with the microinduction strategy I've been suggested? Are there any resources you'd be willing to share that I might find helpful? Someone I spoke with recently mentioned possibly using kratom to help with withdrawals, but I'm not sure if I can take that and Suboxone together. Thoughts?

Thanks again for any help you can provide.",1

I went to a theme park yesterday for the first time since the pandemic started, and I'm super sore today, I'm also taking an accelerated college course and I'm stressed about the amount of work I have to do. Lastly, a very good friend of mine had to put her dog down today. We both own the same breed of dog (we joked that our dogs were dating when we were younger) and bonded 8 years ago over because of our dogs. I've been struggling with my own dog's mortality for a few years, and her dog was younger than mine. Needless to say I'm a mess and my heart is absolutely breaking for her.

Two weeks ago, any of of these instances would cause me to pop half a norco. Hell, I would have popped it just because I hadn't eaten yet and I knew it would hit me stronger. But, I'm 15 days today. Which is the longest I have gone since I started taking norco regularly. It's taking everything in me not to take one. I really want to be able to get to my 30 day goal.

What sucks is that if I take it, I probably can get what I need to get done today. It doesn't cause me to zone out and forget about my problems. It actually helps me get stuff done, which is why it's such a problem for me. I know I can do what I need to do without it, but today just seems extra challenging.

My willpower is stronger than my desire, so I will probably stay clean. But I just wanted some place to vent because I'm doing this alone. Hope everyone is having a good day.

Edit: Didn't give in, but also decided that I just wasn't going to be as productive as I wanted/needed to be today. Better than having to restart my sobriety lol",7

Not for everyone but working for me so far,"I have an update on my Suboxone taper and jump and have a question or two concerning my timeline taking a full agonist the last week. Here goes...

First off, not interested in anyone's opinion if the process I took is the 'right' one as it has so far worked for me. I have been on 2mg Suboxone for 2 years and then around 8 months at 1mg. I tried to taper but as soon as I got down to .75 I could never adjust to the new level and had to go back up. Decided to replace the subs with Roxy as I tapered and then to stay on them for 3 to 4 weeks before jumping. So far?? Worked perfect. I am now 7 days clear of my last Suboxone dose(.25) and have been able to work and be with my family no problem. I am currently taking as little Roxy as possible but to avoid symptoms, I am between 60 and 90mg a day for the last week.  The good news is that I have my buddy holding my Roxy and he will not give me more than 3 pills a day. I have enough for another 12 days and he now has the number to my dealer(I deleted her off my phone and she promised not to take my calls anymore) who will buy back whatever I don't use. 

The other good news is that I have hated being back on Roxy. Hated it. Can't wait to get off of these as well and beyond happy that I have not taken any Bupe in a week, which I consider to be a miracle. I am off the Suboxone train for good and will be off of all opiates no later than 12 days from now(possibly 21 if I cut back on them a bit). 

Question: Will I still have wd's from the Subs after not taking them for 14-18 days? Will I just have the wd's from whatever comes my way from the Roxy? 

This path is not for everyone. I lived 54 years without taking any Opiates and am 100 percent confident I will never get back on them. They ruined me to be honest. I know I am done so being back on Roxy does not worry me at all. Actually being back on them has reminded me how evil these little pills are for people 

I am very curious to know how bad my wd's will be once I jump from the full agonist and if I have somehow avoided the more severe jump if I went straight off from Suboxone without ever taking a blue. 

Good luck to everyone dealing with this horrible drug(s) and I hope my story might be of help to anyone else in a similar situation.",1

Tomorrow I finally have an appointment with the clinic. We will make a taper plan or they will put me on Suboxone.

I had been clean for 15 years had a great job, raised a family and then my wife divorced me. I fell into a deep depression and somehow began using again. No IV, just snorting or smoking. I liked it for about 2 weeks. Now, I am not only barely getting high, but the high is also so different, I really don't enjoy it. At this point, I don't even know why I'm doing it. The more I tell myself just to stop, the more I end up using and still don't even enjoy it. I just want to stop but there is so much mind fuckery going on and here we go again. Where do I find the willpower just to stop?

I am starting to feel suicidal over this. It's now consumed me. If I was getting high I would at least understand it.

Also, I am alone a lot with too much free time. I think down deep, I am punishing myself.",4

I don‚Äôt want to get into the whole story or addition bc I‚Äôm barely hanging on right now - but I‚Äôve seen others have success with posting almost a day by day check in for accountability while they‚Äôre detoxing and early stages in their recovery. For the last year now I‚Äôve attempted to detox alone in my apartment at least once, sometimes twice a month - that‚Äôs 24-36 virtual detoxes in the last couple of years. Longest clean time I ever had was maybe 2 weeks. I‚Äôve been going for NA , and working on building a support group locally and in these really great 24/7 NA meetings on zoom - but not sure who much I buy into any of that but I figured it can‚Äôt hurt to at least give it a try Bc I‚Äôm desperate to try anything these days.

Anyways - idk if this post will even be read but it feels good just to put it in the universe bc no one know the truth of the situation - told family I was feel like flu like and would he out of commission for the next couple weeks (I live alone). I do have a guy friend who‚Äôs clean and he‚Äôs offered to bring me some comfort food and even stay and watch a movie to keep me distracted bc right now it‚Äôs the crippling anxiety- that creepy crawling tingling feeling under your skin.

Anyways - I just want to post my detox timeline here  and maybe have some accountability bc I might not care about myself but I have a huge heart &amp;amp; I wouldn‚Äôt want to let you all down.

So it‚Äôs 11:30 am on Sunday and I last used at 12:15 am - so I‚Äôm at like 11 hours. 
- slept until 10 am and woke up with the reality of the detox that‚Äôs awaiting me. 
 
I‚Äôm already getting that creepy crawling intense anxiety feeling. My mind is dark -I texted a few people thay actually know what I‚Äôm going through and not one has offered to come just sit with me. I am under two blankets and my bones still cold to the bone ugh. 

Going to wake a hot bath and pass out and also do a Kroger delivery for essentials. I know I need Epsom salt and some bananas and yogurt. Any other suggestions ?

EDIT:: 7:30 pm day one 
a little over 19 hours since last use 
Ended up picking up a friend who is going to stay here with me tonight (I picked him up around 3pm) and he annoys me most the time but honestly I need someone who knows what I‚Äôm going through who won‚Äôt be a bad influence that can just sit here and watch movies with me or just sit there while I sleep or wherever bc I get these waves of like intense doom where my heart starts fluttering and I start sweating and it‚Äôs like I want to run away somewhere but can‚Äôt bc I can‚Äôt escape myself and this situation. 

Instacart brought me everything I needed - So took a long Epsom salt lavender bubble bath and then  I ended up taking .25 my of klonopin around 5 pm and slept until 7 pm. again - so thankful I can sleep. mentally I‚Äôm doing better. I‚Äôm actually craving a milkshake and watching the faculty feeling pretty comfortable.

Going to take it easy and hopefully be able to sleep a decent amount tonight and then wake up tomorrow on day 2 - which is usually the worst day for me, but I‚Äôm trying to keep a positive mindset. Love you all",12

Never leave between detox and inpatient. I was doing 2 bricks of heroin/fentanyl a day. I have been clean for 31 days. My discharge date is on Monday 01/24 and I've never felt better about myself. I lost myself and my belongings, my daughter. Everything. To dope. And now that I'm clean I'm trying to get everything back. I know I need to be patient, its going to take time. I have many appointments when I leave here and when I leave I will make even more appointments.(I can't do it right now because i don't have my insurance card smh. Its coming in the mail). But anyways, if you TRULY TRULY want to get clean, then check yourself in TODAY. Stop making excuses. Get your fucking life back. You can do it. Yes its something that you have to work at every single day after getting clean & yes we have to work twice as hard as ""normal non-alcohilics/drug addicts"" but I promise you can do it. You can get your life back. Get your family and friends back who stopped talking to you while you were using heavily. Live the life that you were supposed to live until your life got destroyed by alcohol/drugs. 
The only thing I'm really nervous about is... leaving inpatient and going back home. I don't know how il going to feel. I'm very nervous. I still talk to my last roommate that I had in here. She has gone home and the first week she left she was texting and calling me saying she needed to come back to inpatient... I rly hope that doesn't happen to me. I know a friend cleaned out her entire house while she was in treatment. So I know that wasn't the problem. I'm going to try to be as positive as I possibly can be. Also, I am on 100mg of methadone. If you don't like that. Then don't comment bc I don't care. Its the only thing that actually helped me get clean and where I am today. I tried suboxone, put myself into precipitated withdrawal after waiting 4 days & I tried to get clean the old fashioned cold turkey way... that didn't work either. The withdrawal symptoms were so fucking bad I couldn't take it anymore. And bc of how low my dose was at the time, the methadone wasn't helping me either. So I had to still use dope to feel 100000 percent okay. 

If you actually read all of this, thank you for reading and remember you can do this! Not for anyone else but for yourself. You should want to get clean. If you don't want to then inpatient sadly won't work because you'll just sign yourself out... Like I did the first time I tried inpatient. I stayed one night and left.",20

Need help,"Hi guys, I know there are some super smart people in this group so I know I'll be on my way to getting my life back soon. Please help if you can! 

Sorry a bit long.  just want to be thorough so anyone's advice would be more accurate to my situation.  

Currently I use between 80-100 mg of oxy OC 80'S per day, maybe a day off per week or only use 20 mg that day. . Been on this protocol for roughly a year. Always pharma!  I've been Prescribed 50 10mg Norco a month for the last 3 years.  I gotta quit before this gets worse. I can't go on living this way with a family and business. I'm losing interest in everything, it's affecting my marriage and starting to affect my work ethic. I need to do something about it now before it really snowballs. 

How's this taper look? Fyi I tried to quit a few months back , had no idea about withdrawal and did it pretty abruptly.  not quite CT but almost. Fuck that, after 2.5 days my wife thought I had covid or something cause how I was acting.  and was bitching at me for not helping with the kids or anything else around the house. Plus I was completely ignoring business related issues.  Maybe I'm a wimp but I felt like the withdrawal was pretty bad just 2.5 days in. 

So with no taper experience  I'm looking for some input or maybe even a full on schedule that worked for you! 

Ill be using mundipharma OC 80's and 40's split and quartered if needed. 
11 weeks 
Week 1 80 mg everyday 
Week 2 70 mg every day
Week 3 60 mg every day
Week 4 50 mg everyday 
Week 5 40 mg everyday
Week 6 30 mg everyday 
Week 7 25 mg everyday
Week 8 20 mg everyday 
Week 9 15 mg everyday 
Week 10 10 mg every day 
Week 11 10 mg everyday
THEN JUMP! 
 I have plenty of gabapentin, clonadine, and, .5 xanax for the following week or 2 or however long needed for some help with symptoms.   

 
I only take my doses at night currently. I work all day then around 6pm I take 15- 20 mg cause I start to feel a little shitty. Kids go to bed at 8 then I take 40mg and then 20-40 more around 10 or 11. Then hit the sheets around 130am.  

Question, egardless if you agree with the taper length and amounts:

1)During the taper should I stick to taking it at night like above or should I spread it out over the whole day/night?  

Questions regarding the actual taper:

1) is this taper long enough to significantly reduce  withdrawals ? 

2) I have more than enough oxy to stretch this out a bit more if it would be better.  Should I maybe do 10 days before decreasing dosage each time instead of only a week?  

3) should I decrease dosage by less than 10 mg each time? Maybe only 5mg and make this a 20 week thing. 

Maybe I should do #2 and #3 ? 

I've heard of people tapering for a year , probably at extreme high levels though.  I don't want to do super long if I don't need to. 

Reason I want to taper is I can't do physical withdrawals for 7-10 days around My wife and kids. They don't know! .  Also,  I have tons of obligations running my business and at home. So I can't really call into work or take a week worth of vacation from my own business if you know what I mean. 

I appreciate everyone in here as I usually read through this sub daily to keep my mind made up about quitting. It's inspirational and all of you are worth it!!! Peace and love ‚úåüèº‚ù§",3

I‚Äôve posted here before, but for context I have permanent neuropathy from chemo. Up until recently, this was treated with opiates. It‚Äôs the only thing that eases the pain. I‚Äôve seen several doctors, all of them want me off opiates. So I‚Äôve been tapering and coming to terms with the fact that I‚Äôll no longer have this crutch when I‚Äôm in pain. 

For the briefest of periods I thought maybe, just maybe, I could find my medication through plugs or on the onion fields. I don‚Äôt think I understood how unsustainable that actually is. $2 per mg? I get annoyed when I have to pay $2 per pill. There‚Äôs no way I could afford my medication through alternative means. 

So this is really happening. Unless I switch to something that‚Äôs impossible to dose, like fentanyl, I‚Äôm really losing opiates. 

I got surgery on Tuesday and was sent home without a script. I‚Äôve been trying to make it through without using any of my extra medication. So far I‚Äôve been successful. But I‚Äôm in pain and I feel resentful. 

I know giving up opiates is the best thing I can do, and I‚Äôm aware that I have an unhealthy attachment and dependence on them. I know my quality of life will be better once I‚Äôm fully recovered from surgery and once withdrawals are over with. 

But I still resent this taper and my heart isn‚Äôt all there. If my doctors offered me my old script, I‚Äôd take it in a millisecond. Looking back, if was such a luxury to have access to the pain control I did. I doubt very many people get that experience nowadays.

There‚Äôs no point in reminiscing though. I won‚Äôt get that back. Being off of opiates is better than spending my salary on drugs every year. This is the only reasonable choice I get.",10

Please read this if you're on the verge.,"Not entirely sure what my motivation for writing this is. Maybe it's due the fact that I'm currently experiencing an unbearable amount of guilt and shame with zero desire to spew the same tired bullshit to the same tired people who have actually stuck with me through this. Maybe someone on the verge of making the same irrehensibly absurd decision I made five days ago will read this and remember what's at stake for them. It frightens me how rapid and cold my mind can get. How quick I can be to forget everything and everyone in my selfish search for pleasure. At times it feels as though I'm at war with myself. I remember clutching the steering wheel while I was well on my way towards throwing away seven months of progress and promises. ""What are you doing, Roy? This is so fucking stupid. This is so fucking stupid."" I'm still not sure if my intention was to stop myself or if I was trying to get myself off on the excitement of how irresponsible I was being. Regardless, when you're at war with yourself unfortunately it's typically those who are closest to you who get caught in the crossfire. Sometimes you're lucky and you get it over with quickly. I was ""lucky"" this time. I was found in my truck by police who just happened to be driving by at the perfect time. My body was slumped against the steering wheel and my foot was on the clutch with the truck running. They pulled me out and I was hit with narcan twice. I came to in the back of an ambulance completely disoriented with no real solid grasp on what was happening or where I was. It gradually set in though. ""I'm in an ambulance?"" ""I don't know what happened..I was.."" ""Oh God"" ""I can't believe I did this again."" I've lost everything now. My truck that had been borrowed to me so I could clean pools and make easy money is now gone and so is the job. The trust I had somehow managed to gain is now gone. On top of this I'm now facing felony posession charges as well as a DWI. All of this for a quick fix. I really don't know what to make of any of it. I'm not suicidal in the slightest, but how and why do I keep managing to survive due to the most extraordinary coincidences? Why doesn't the universe do everyone a favor and just get rid of me for good? I gave it every opportunity it needed. Albeit it wasn't my intention to do so, but I was right there. A quick and easy solution. At what point does someone just accept the fact that they are simply a bad person? Intention is often irrelevant in this instance and to put things simply..a bad person who wants to do good is still a bad person. I would argue that I am of the worst kind of people. The person who brings you hope and promises. The kind of person who somehow manages to convince himself and those around him that they really are changing for the better. This time will be different..but it never is and I never do. Not for long anyway. I'm so tired of being a black hole in everyone's life. I don't even know how to properly love someone regardless of how amazing they are to me. I always end up miserable with myself. So, anyway. Back to square one. Five days clean today (yay) Nothing more to do than drag one foot in front of the other and eventually settle into another rhythm. One bittersweet aspect of this is how good I've become at dusting myself off and trying again. It's one of the only things I have at this point. If you're reading this and you've got some sobriety under your belt please do not let the life that NA gave you get in the way of AA/NA. Keep taking your medicine and don't let yourself forget.",9

2022-01-19 19:20:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/s850yl/rapid_opiate_detox_icu_what_it_was_like/,Rapid Opiate Detox (ICU)-- what it was like," 

Last summer I tried an RC opiate, became addicted almost immediately and developed a habit that exploded both in dosage and cost - but very quickly wholly lacked any feel good. Completely maintenance. Because of where I was getting this shit the daily habit was eventually upwards of $300 depending on availability. The doses I was taking of this stuff were truly stupendous.

Anyways, I spent months trying to plan an escape route that might work and never could. I got subs but didn't want on them (though they remained in my back pocket as a better alternative to this habit). Tried tapering to something less insane, failed there too. Early this year came across articles on 'rapid opiate detox', or 'anesthesia assisted opiate detox' (which is simply precipitating withdrawal with IV naloxone in an anesthetized patient, and keeping them on naltrexone for the foreseeable future after the PWD via IV Nalaxone).

There's lots of opinions on this process, for a lot of reasons. Most of the bad rap from the medical community that I could find stemmed from Dr's offering this as an escape hatch to the truly dopesick in an outpatient setting. They'd sedate the shit out of someone in their office, not bothering to ask if the person just ate lunch or whatever, then they'd push Naloxone, and the person *had* just eaten and so aspirates right there on the Dr's floor. So the medical community still seems a bit leery about this whole thing.

The place I does the procedure an ICU where they monitor your and do whatever they need to do if shit were to go sideways.

They admit you to the hospital 24 hours before ""the procedure"" and run tests, etc. The Dr talks with you about what you were taking and how much, and then hooks you up to a constant morphine drip potent enough to prevent withdrawal.

For me, I was in for an RC for which exists fairly little research. I explained the best I could the equivalency that I suspected (Morphine Milligram Equivalence), and he thought it was pretty cool I knew what that was and then chose a lower number and said we could adjust up if it wasn't enough. We adjusted up.

At like 6am on day two, they take you to the ICU, get you hooked up proper to all the machinery, and have you swallow 25 or 50mg of naltrexone. This part all went REALLY fast, I was kind of blown away by the rapidity of it. From arrival at the ICU: Get out of the wheelchair, face that way, five electrodes on you, put on this gown, lay down right there, and suddenly your arm is cold and lights out.

Right after I went out they apparently push a shitload of Nalaxone into your IV and precipitate withdrawal. I have no idea how they know how long to keep you out in order to not experience any of the withdrawal itself, but apparently it only takes about an hour if you jam enough Nalaxone into someone. And by the time IV Nalaxone starts wearing off the naltrexone is digested and taking up any avail receptors left open by the now metabolizing Nalaxone. Or whatever. I never could get a Doctor to do anything but hand wave this procedure itself, so this is just what I've put together from the various people I talked to prior to going in.

When I came to apparently it had only been an hour but I thought I was in another fucking universe. I don't know if it was the sedatives or fallout from the precipitated w/d (which I never felt, btw), but it was at least 5 or 6 hours before I knew where I was. I threw up once in the bed, which was gross and I felt bad about later. They cleaned it up and got me a new gown and shit. They monitor you for 24 hours in the ICU afterwards. I was super pissed about that. I insisted I needed to go right now or at least give me my phone or something, and they were like ""can you even walk"". Don't remember much after that but apparently slept the entire 24 hours. Maybe woke up here and there long enough to be annoyed that I was in an ICU bed.

After 24 hours they work me up and said they were discharging me from the hospital, congrats no longer addicted. I had paid for a program that then provided a retreat place to rest and get your head back. That was nice because I didn't have to do anything. They wheeled me to the van from the place. The place wheeled me into a really nice room and just dumped me on a bed. Said they'd bring me anything i wanted and would be back every hour to check how I felt, if I needed any meds, etc (you leave the hospital with RXs for a variety of things, including a small benzo script for anxiety, clonidine for any residual w/d, muscle relaxers and sleep stuff).

I stayed at that retreat place for 3 or 4 days afterwards, which was actually really good, because I was functionally useless until like the 3rd day after the procedure. The place just keep feeding me smoothies and fluids and otherwise didn't really fuck with me. If you wanna sleep, sleep. If you wanna watch movies,. watch movies. They have yoga and whatever else if that's your thing.

And on day 6 I woke up and checked out of the place. Generally this procedure is followed up with a Vivitrol shot, which I did not want, but you can instead opt for an oral naltrexone instead which I did. I've been taking 25mgs/day. No idea if it's helping. They say it helps or entirely prevents cravings. I haven't had any of those so maybe the naltrexone is due the credit.

So now been 8 days since I dosed any opiate. I am definitely not back to 100% -- but I feel pretty good and there are clear positives: Music is amazing, the sex drive holy shit, brain not stuck in a dumpster trying to rattle something off in a meeting. But there is also a nagging melancholy....hot flashes here and there. Bouts of lethargy. I think kind of what you'd expect of post-acutes.

For the first 6 years of my use, I rarely had more than a month clean ever. That was usually my max. I found ways to always rationalize doing it one time out of the blue which would spiral into a full 3 month long binge or something. So I started using kratom a few years back initially to help with W/Ds but it eventually became somewhat of a replacement. I would still dabble with pills or even fent here and there but the kratom made me not have complete melt down type relapses. And then the full breakthrough came and I was able to stay clean from oxy for a year and a half(my longest time ever). Eventually the kratom became a problem though. I was taking too much and I started to notice weird things occurring with nerve tingling in my limbs and my throat being sore a lot (I tossed and washed my kratom mostly). The adverse kratom effects started about 8 months ago. So I had the genius(lol) idea a few months ago to stop kratom and do oxys for just like 4-5 days to get me through the kratom W/D because I figured I wasn‚Äôt physically addicted to oxy anymore. Obviously this was incredibly stupid and I‚Äôve since been on a HEAVY 3 month binge where I got up to doing Twelve 30s at a time. Fucking insane. Also, I maxed my credit cards which sucks cuz I fixed my credit so good the last few years, but Its ok I won‚Äôt miss any payments and I‚Äôll get it paid off. I won‚Äôt let my credit fall to shit ever again. I also owe my Dealer a bit of money but i have that arranged already where I‚Äôll pay off a little at a time. So now I‚Äôm 4 days in clean and feeling very confident. I‚Äôm using kratom for a week for W/Ds and I plan on stopping that then by using lyrica for a few days and by day 11 not taking anything except maybe a colonopin to sleep if necessary. I‚Äôve never been a 12 steps program type guy. I‚Äôm wondering what are some other things/steps everyone here uses to stay clean and to especially get through the first few months. This Reddit group is a place I plan to frequent often because reading your stories and interacting will help me I think. I will start the gym again tomorrow and I have some podcasts that I listen to.

Could really use some input...,"Quick history - I am on Day 84 after about 8yrs of pain management with low dose Perc. I did an ultra-slow taper with absolutely no WD when it ended - outside of some gas and insomnia (and low/no libido). I had some minor discomfort the last part of my taper along with the start of the insomnia.

The insomnia has just stuck around and actually gotten much worse around the 2 month mark. I eat super clean and lift 5x week (bodybuilder). I am doing ok on falling asleep at this point, but around 2am-3am I will always wake up. Once I am awake at that time I am stuck awake for 2-3 hours, if not the remainder of the night. I have also noticed that within a few minutes of waking up I will begin to sweat profusely.

My sleep was very hit and miss the first couple months (3-4 ok nights // 3-4 bad nights). I think it was around Day 58 that I suddenly couldn't fall back asleep (1 good night // 6 bad nights). I do not have any caffeine except for the little that I have at lunch in my decaffeinated green tea. I do take dexedrine for ADD, but have been on it and stable since middle school and has no ""excitatory"" effect on me.

Is it normal for sleep to take a dive after a couple months? Normal to wake and then begin to sweat profusely? It sound like it could be something like my sympathetic nervous system is being kicked on. How long does this usually last?

I am trying to stay strong, but it would sure be easier to keep it all together if I could get some sleep. I am just wondering if this abnormal or par for the course. If it is normal, how long did it last for you guys?

I cannot take other meds, the reason I stopped my pain medication was to improve fertility and unfortunately every medication has some possible affect on fertility.

ANY help/insight/experience on this would be GREATLY appreciated!! I can handle honesty.",4

I'm just really scared because tramadol has an antidepressant element. I rely on that feeling daily to stop me from feeling depressed. I don't think espranor is going to do shit for that. 

Tramadol is the reason I get out of bed most days as its the only source of motivation, it's that effect that i can just do things without being miserable and tired... I know that this sounds like the addiction brain speaking but I've come off it before for a month and I've never been more unmotivated and unproductive... I'm just concerned that espranor will just make this worse whilst withdrawing from the snri in the tramadol. Or will it help? I really don't know

Edit ** last time I withdrew I jumped out of a car at 40mph on a main road. I also completely dissociated and rambled on about offensive stuff and lost a few friends... I didn't even remember it being me. I also crapped myself :/",4

I'm still going through my withdrawal and recovering from the toxic effects of benzos due to me being very sensitive to them, but I feel like I'm in a good enough spot to where I potentially don't need the hydrocodone anymore to get me through the day.. My only problem is that I've built up a tolerance and I've tried quitting for 3 weeks now with me getting 50 hrs max then reinstate.

Honestly for me, almost all the withdrawal symptoms are a cake walk compared to the living hell I went through from the benzos, my ONLY problem is the fucking restless leg syndrome/akathisia.. I've been predisposed to RLS my entire life and was a nightmare at various times through my life without any drugs involved, so you can only imagine how bad it is now during opioid withdrawal.. Smoking weed was my only escape from insomnia and RLS prior to using benzos, but I can't smoke weed anymore because the benzos made me extremely sensitive to THC now, I've never been able to take benadryl for sleep since it makes my RLS 10x worse, I can't drink due to the damn benzos via sensitivity, Kratom makes me violently ill oddly enough.. I'm pretty much shit outta luck it seems, so that's why I'm here.. I'd take Lyrica (Pregablin) for the duration of my withdrawal, but I'm far too afraid to mess with my GABA system in anyway. I have no idea what to do because the RLS is so unbearable and I NEED to get off of this shit.

I'm not gonna let drugs dictate the way I live my fucking life. The sad part is that this all started from a prescription of Temazepam as an alternative to smoking weed for sleep as I was trying to quit smoking. Little did I know of what benzos could possibly do to someone that's extremely sensitive to them. I was never even a drug abuser to begin with. Well maybe too much THC, but that's literally it and I was trying to get off of it :(",2

I'm now 4 and a half weeks clean from codeine and around 2 weeks off of phenibut. I'm on lyrica and baclofen, titrating down to mitigate phenibut withdrawal. I'm also addicted to benzos, mainly diazepam and it kills me that I don't know what dose I actually need so I could start tapering. I estimate 20-25 mg just to stave off WD's. I take seroquel for sleep and have just been scripted bupropion to make me bounce back.

I never had so much clean time from opioids. It's weird. Kicking 15mg morphine after a year was a breeze compared to kicking 30mg after a two. I'm also in a relationship which ended when my addiction went tits up and we were supposed to see it as a new begining. As per her word, she had a date in that time frame and as soon as I had a week or so clean from phenibut she moved back in.

I can't be a good friend, a good lover or a good son. I feel disabled because I just wanna lay there and let the time pass. I feel pressured by her cause she's clueless about drug WD. She sees so much clean time and assumes I should be fine. She isn't even ok about me talking to her about my meds. 

I might be so loopy because of the seroquel because as soon as shit hits the fan in the evening I either take 300mg xr or chew bits and pieces. Any input on past opioid users on seroquel would be appreciated. Some nights I even take 600mg just to pass out. I have trazodone too but it makes me feel like trying to sleep during weed and benzo wd.

I started to enjoy little things, music hits different but I feel like my legs are made out of granite. Baclofen makes any drug including weed have close to zero effects so I'm stuck eating sugar or doing whatever.

When will shit get better? Or it has already but I went overboard with the seroquel and traded a happy life for a deep, REM filled sleep?",2

I am something of an addict. The only thing that has deterred me from becoming a hardened one is the amount of anxiety I have. I'll get straight to it. I stumbled across a Oxypro ( oxycodone) in my cupboard. They are 10mg. It's been about eight days and I have been taking them morning and evening. The most I have taken it 20mg in the morning and same in the evening. Sometimes none in the morning and 20mg in the evening. They are slow release ones. I realise what I have done and am now panicking about withdrawing terribly. I have five left and figured that one in the morning (10mg) and one in the evening (10mg) would see me be ok? I keep feeling paincky. Am I going overboard here or will I feel the full force of this? Will it kill me? Hope someone can help.",11

The first days were hell, forward to this day I have no withdrawals at all. Well obviously I do but feels like I don't, EXPECT: I have no motivation at all, not to get out of bed, not to go the market (2mins away), not to make food, not work out (will do after this to get my testorone back and heal my brain)

AND WORST symptom im having, my apt has good heating system, well good enough, and im really cold in full clothes, hoodies, and even a bedsheet on top of me sometimes im cold as fuck. When I sleep im cold but then I get hot as fuck, no sweats anymore really. And I notice I have a lot more anxiety and depression than i used to have.

Any clue when this hell is gonna end? Its winter and already cold as fuck, i cant hang out with anybody (even in indoors with my jacket on, because its cold as fuck)

I have some clonodine, it helps a little but not much. Granted I take low doses because i dont have much. Any clues? Is nicotine bad for the withdrawals or caffeine, well im at day20 but still. mainly nicotine, because ive been going ham on that, even more after I was off percocets.",8

It was the only thing that would help with my anxiety, cramps, and hip pain. I would take it to work (I work in the restaurant industry) or when I had a lot to do and wanted to feel good while doing it. It wasn't consistent until I got COVID over the summer. The isolation was brutal for me. I think I took something every day for three weeks. Then I started to notice I couldn't really do things without cravings. If I didn't have a pill, the hard things became MUCH harder and I was a roller coaster of emotions. I wouldn't say I was addicted, but I was absolutely dependent.

Got to a point at the end of last year where they didn't even do anything for me anymore and I always felt sick after. I didn't kick the habit until a few days after the new year, but I think 10 days is definitely the longest I've gone in almost four years. The first few days I had headaches and was CONSTANTLY thinking about taking one. I just wanted SOMETHING. I ended up having some CBD. After that it got a lot better. I've been eating healthier, doing more things, and I don't feel this guilt or dread tied to this stupid habit that I got into 7 years ago because my shitty ex boyfriend loved popping pills.

I'm also kicking this completely on my own. No support. Nothing. Nobody in my life knows I even have this habit. I know not every day will be easy but I'm super proud of myself.

I'm wondering if anyone has any stories where they've seen people in this state overcome their addiction?","My brother moved to Pittsburgh 10 years ago and somehow ended up in Philly. He's been living around  Kensington Ave for the past 3-4 years. He was at a shelter for a while. He used to call my dad at least once every few weeks. Then he went 4 months without communicating so I reached out to an ex gf of his who told me he was in bad shape and was addicted to fentanyl. Me and my dad flew out there and found him at a shelter. We spent time with him and got him evaluated and checked into a rehab within 2 days. We found out he left 5 days later (likely when the medication management ended). I haven't seen him since. He called once to defend his reasoning for leaving rehab and to ask for money but when we my dad said no, that was the last time he called. This was 6 months ago.

I flew out to Philly again last week. I found out he was discharged from that same shelter. I searched up and down Kensington. I left my phone number at all the main community centers. Someone who knows him called me today and told me they saw him pushing a cart at the park and that he looks like he lives on the streets now, and that he's still very active in his addiction. When they told him I was in Philly looking for him, it didn't really faze him, almost like he didn't believe them or didn't care and kept walking to wherever he was headed. It's freezing out there right now btw and he's apparently living on the street. This feels like rock bottom for him. I can't understand why he wouldn't react to hearing I was physically in town looking for him but I understand the addiction has completely changed him.

We don't want to give up, but we are also at a loss for what else we can do. I have plans to fly out to Philly again, but these trips are heartbreaking for my dad so I want to have a plan in place or else it'll feel hopeless.

My reason for posting is to find some hope I guess. 6 months ago, he was in bad shape but he had housing at the very least. Now he seems to have hit rock bottom to be living on the streets like that. Has anyone ever had a similar experience with themselves or with a family member? Is it possible for someone to find the will power to want help in that kind of situation living on the streets completely addicted?

I first switched to suboxone.... it was getting me higher than the 30s did. And that was at 8mg. I rode that wave for about a month to realize it's 100% more addicting. 

I switched back to 30s to find I was peaking at 300mgs. So this is where I tapered. I went a little more rapidly than I should have but 2 months later I was ready for the jump.

I went to a rapid detox took subutex the first day. Second day I refused all meds and rode the wave.
 
The first 5 days I used klonopin to sleep. I'd take .25 milligrams at a time until I fell asleep. Then went to a doctor to get mirtazipine to help with my sleep. It works wonders but if you don't get 8 hours it's hell to shake it off the first few hours.

Now I have a couple of beers from time to time and on those nights I don't need the Mirtazipine. If the urge to take pills gets really bad ill take some kratom. It works for an hour or so then wears off.

I never got the pink cloud everyone talks about but I do get constant headaches and wierd head pressure. But it's all relatively manageable.

Eventually I got out around age 19, met my current boyfriend who I love with all my heart. He had past addictions (not with opiates) and actually helped me to get 6 months clean.

Fast forward, we‚Äôve been together 3 years, and I‚Äôve been using for almost 2 of those consistently. I convinced him it was ‚Äúno worse than a perc‚Äù one time while partying and then we both fell into the trap. I know he can make his own decisions but I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty that this my fault . 

We‚Äôve both been using almost daily and we just can‚Äôt do it anymore. Our dealer is unreliable even when I give him $$, so I end up getting sick a lot.  It‚Äôs draining financially mentally physically, and we both are functional addicts who dont really have the option to tell mine or his family. 

We rent from them and would lose everything if they knew the truth. I would lose every friend but 1 if they knew the truth (I‚Äôve claimed to be clean for years).  been looking into getting subs from a telemedicine app (no car at the moment) and I know it‚Äôs just ‚Äúanother addiction‚Äù but I just want to feel like myself again without being sick daily.. same with him. If you remove the drugs from our relationship is actually quite healthy which is why I want to nip this in the bud now. 

I don‚Äôt have any cannabis (only thing that helps me when sober) and a few benzos. Any advice to Get us through this at home detox (have tried hot showers, cold meds etc) because I can‚Äôt take the sweats anymore. I don‚Äôt want to die at 22..",6

&#x200B;

I need some expert assistance please.

&#x200B;

I am a 39 year old MAT/ORT patient; been on sublingual buprenorhine 9mg daily (countrywide availability ONLY of sublingual tablets - no Sublocade or sublingual strips available) for close to 4 years.  Also have chronic pain issues from an MVA in 2010 which the buprenorphine keeps under fair control.

&#x200B;

Probably not under control for VERY MUCH longer; I have needed revision surgery about > 3 years ago now for bilateral comminuted femur fractures (complicated by osteomyelitits which reared its head 9 months after the first surgeries in 2010).  Osteomyelitis resolved as far as I'm aware.  Also sustained an idiopathic NOF (hip) fracture when osteomyelitis meds caused an idiopathic seizure event.

&#x200B;

MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM, THOUGH:  My country (South Africa) has been steadily but very clearly running out of even wholesaler-stock buprenorphine sublingual tablets for roughly the past month, without immediate indication(s) that anyone who can do anything about it actually gives a fuck.

&#x200B;

Suboxone and Subutex have LITERALLY saved my life, and I am on the fucking *brink* of getting all the damage I did during 10 years of active any-opiate-all-opiates addiction sorted out.

&#x200B;

\- Currently, I take (1 x 8mg Subutex S/L tab) + (0.5 x 2mg Subutex S/L tab) = 9mg total once daily

  OR:    (1 x 8mg Suboxone S/L tab R side) + (0.5 x 2mg Subutex S/L tab L side) = 9mg total once daily

&#x200B;

\- As of today, I've got a total of ***246mg*** **total S/L buprenorphine** as my TOTAL STOCK

\- AFTER I worked out a 27-day rapid buprenorhine taper (as **absolute worst case scenario,** to zero mg from my current 9mg-daily dose) I have exactly 22 days left to continue my daily 9mg-daily dose.

&#x200B;

I am a doctor (in fact, an MAT / Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Medicine physician, which people can probably see from my post history.

In order to await resolution or fucking NOT of this evidently-impending crisis, I was able to arrange a BACKUP supply of **METHADONE** for when worst-case scenario has come and gone:  3000ml methadone syrup \[2mg/ml\].  

**I have never used Methadone before AT ALL.  Which is why the coming weeks will be fucking scary.  I will probably have to switch from Buprenorphine to Methadone as maintenance MAT/ORT but I** ***really do not wish to inadvertently kill myself doing so - which will definitely make it appear as though I relapsed and OD'ed.***

Done my research and my maths so far; and from all sources I was able to find (sources which were SO GODDAMN FUCKING OLD, it ***SEEMS*** *that there is no direct equivalency that would apply to switching* ***AND*** there is the rather huge discrepancy in half-life between Buprenorphine and Methadone.

&#x200B;

It ***SEEMS*** that, at maintenance, **4mg** Buprenorphine \~ **20mg** Methadone.  I cannot vouch for how accurate, up-to-date or reliable this research is.  In my country (aside from some *really weird & creepy pharmacologists*) I can confidently say that I am probably the most educated when it comes to SARMed, Opioid Replacement Therapy and MAT.

&#x200B;

THUS:  My *cri de coeur* is this:

\- If ANYONE on here has any sourced information (ideally double-blind & peer-reviewed & all that, but let's not start laughing our asses off) I would terribly appreciate some guidance.  Preferably in table format so that I can be prepped and get it all ready for when the ambergris strikes the propeller-blades.

\- I don't know if Reddit has a MAT-specific sub either.  Haven't yet had time to look.  In other words, tell me to fuck off if I need to do that.

&#x200B;

One memory that will always remain was the extreme restlessness at night; fidgeting and kicking, being so tired but could not lay still so I paced around the house for hours. And the panic. If I did sleep I woke up in a state of panic. That feeling lingered all day but I was so tired I couldn't leave my couch, just half awake and petrified because of the anxiety. 

I had never done an opiate other than light hydrocodone use, but got on methadone for pain management since I couldn't see a specialist or pain management for my back. I remember my first dose of methadone. I was so out of it at 30 mg. I couldn't drive because my vision was so blurry, I had to close one eye just to stay in my lane. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Two months later I found out I was pregnant. I went to the clinic to tell them I needed off the methadone, and to my horror I was told that was not possible for the safety of the baby. Worst time of my life. 

At 6 months pregnant, my dose wasn't holding me anymore and the nurse and I put in an order to increase 1 mg per day up to 10mg bringing my total dose to 40. After the second day of increased dosing I felt amazing. Third day I ask what my dose was and they had increased my dose 5 mg a day. I thought I had increased by three mg, turns out it was 15 before I finally asked and told them to stop. The nurse was fired shortly after I filed a grievance. 

4 years later, after reaching 80mg and finally working my way back down I jumped off at 10mg. I had help from my new pain management doctor and my primary care doctor, who gave me the best medications on the market for withdrawal. I stayed in my bedroom away from my husband and children for 10 days in a compounded state of pain, thirst, writhing in sweated-through- clothing and sheets. Heart rate at 46 beats per minute from the meds so I couldn't stand up without nearly passing out. I was a prisoner. BUT-

Today is 90 days. 

I'm not sleeping much, and I rarely have the energy to do anything, but I'm awake, aware, and continuing to improve. Some days are better than others. Some days suck. The other morning I woke up and made the kids pancakes, eggs, and bacon before school, and that was when I knew I was going to be okay. 

I will get my energy back, my mind will continue to heal, and it will all be worth it. I hope so anyways.

It's been a minute since I've been on here and I should really be better about checking in or at least responding to other posts, honestly for a selfish reason cuz it's good for my own mental health.  

I've been a little out of it this past month, just cuz I've been working from home cuz my work is closed jan/Feb (outdoor bar). It's nice getting paid to sit at home and redesign marketing/promo material for my company's 4 restaurants; i honestly have to like shake myself sometimes cuz I'll be sitting on the couch on my laptop responding to emails while editing a flier or event packet and it'll hit me like, wow, holy shit, you've got a real big girl job, you're a manager and you're working from home doing the actual thing you want to do for your career. Shit is wild.  

 I'm extremely grateful for my work; I was legit not even 2 months clean when I first started there and I've come so far. All my bosses and colleagues that im fairly close to who have also been there for a few years (we opened 2 new restaurants this last year so there's a lot of new staff) know that I used to be a junkie and are always really supportive and awesome. Can't believe come may I'll have been with the company for 3 years- before I got clean, the longest I'd ever lasted in any job was just under a year.  

Anyway, even though this is a nice break from running service, I honestly hate working from home. I need to be, like, out in the world and around other people. If I ever do end up working a fully remote gig at some point in my life I'll straight up pay for one of those coworking space desk things myself cuz I will go insane otherwise. Pre covid I could like go do my work in a coffee shop n that's what I usually did w like school work etc, but now omicron done made it so there's barely any coffee shops that have indoor seating and the ones that do close mad early cuz they're short staffed.  

Also, I woke up feeling sick as fuck today. I'm worried I have covid; I woke up with a headache, sore throat, mild fever, n body aches. I scheduled a test for later today, they only had rapid antigen appts available which kinda sucks but oh well. I took some ibuprofen and my head and throat feel a little better but I still have straight up restless legs rn which is KILLING me. Honestly rls was always the most miserable physical kicking symptom for me. When I first woke up i straight up felt dopesick, all covered in sweat and totally exhausted and achy.. fucking awful. I mean, yeah, getting some type of fever/cold thing is purely physical; and it was really always the mental symptoms of kicking that were unbearable to me and would lead me to say fuck it and go pick up, but I think ive like pavloved myself cuz whenever I do get sick now my brain inadvertently starts to go into that shitty dark place it'd be at when I was dopesick.  

Alright, this is fuckin long enough lmao. Stg I tried to keep it short but at this point let's just admit I'm incapable of that lmao. How is everyone else doing? If any of y'all have gotten covid and had it be uncomfortably close-feeling to being dopesick, how did you cope both mentally and physically? Ya girl could use some advice cuz ugh I'm such a pussy when it comes to this shit lol. Well lemme wrap it up. Have a good Sunday everyone!  

Edit a few hours later if anyone sees this:  I have covid ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è I knew this day would come at some point lol, shit is gonna suck and I def feel kinda like I'm dopesick which is fuckin w my head buuuut it is what it is, I can only control what I can control yk. Fingers crossed shit goes away p quick!",3

Over the past year, there were days (less then 5 total) that I did take a Xanax. I never did it 2 days in a row. I would take one, then for example, a few months later take one, and so on. There was also about a week in there (6 months ago) that I did cocaine for a few days (not proud of that at all).

My question to you all is: would you consider this a year sober or no?",6

As the title says, I'm switching from codeine to subs over the next couple of days. 
How long after my last codeine dose (last dose being 60mg) would it be safe to start on the subs and avoid PWD?

Anyway I'm a former IV Heroin user who had been in recovery since December 21, 2018 so I have been out of the opiate circle completely for quite awhile. Well about 2 weeks ago I broke my foot in 5 different places, needless to say it has been quite painful. On Wed. Jan 5th 2022 one of my employees told me he had a guy who sold 30mg Oxy. Without much thought I was like hell yeah let me get 2 of them. So as I was dropping him off at his house after scoring I went ahead and snorted half the pill then headed home. By the time I had made it 500 yards to the stop sign of his road I was already feeling it. I knew something was up. I rushed home got in the recliner and passed out for about 3 hrs. Woke up basically sober that's when I was 99% sure it was fent. But Damn it was good! Started quartering them and had a great night! Next day I bought 10.... fast forward to tonight Jan.16 and I have currently snorted about 22 of these Fent M-30s. I have 5 left and I am determined that they will be my last I cannot go any deeper down this rabbit hole. Anyway I woke up about 2am last night and was clearly in WD I snorted a quarter and went back to sleep. What I am wondering is if 1. How intense do yall think my WD will be and how long it might last.
2. How long until my piss is clean? 
3. Should I use my last 5 to taper down?
5. Will some Kratom extract capsules help ease my symptoms? 
The euphoria that I was getting the first few days was amazing but now I can't seem to get it anymore so I definitely feel it's time to quit before I can't by myself. Also I have no idea about the way fent works or about the numerous ""analogues "" that are going around. All I know about them is the stuff I've read here and from what I understand is they stay in your system a long time. How would I know if I've gotten real fent or analogues? Anyway thanks for reading and if you have any advice to help me quit taking these things it would mean the world to me and my 4 yo son.... his dad needs to stay alive....",3

Can it be taken right away, or is it advisable to wait a little bit? I'm scared after starting I won't be able to find any fent to possibly pull me out of PWD. I'm guessing it is advisable to have at least enough to pull you out before you start? Then again I would be withdrawing eventually anyways if I can't find fent, the question is would I be withdrawing less if I hadn't taken the micro-dose of suboxone? I used to be able to just wait a little with H and then take my sub and I'd usually be fine, not the same with all the fentanyl sh\*t. Or I could take some kratom and pretty much get rid of my withdrawals almost, got off subs using kratom before. I bought some kratom recently to handle the fentanyl withdrawals but I can't even tell if it is helping any. Fentanyl and its analogs are horrible. I've come off IV'ing high doses of powerful RC benzos before, psychosis with tremors and hallucinations everywhere I look, and have had alcohol withdrawal psychosis in the past from insanely huge daily alcohol amounts.

I'd like to make a thread where we share knowledge about what to take to help deal with recovery. Mostly in the post acute.  Can you guys please post what works the best? I will chip in tell you guys what I know works really well too.

Acute withdrawal:

If you can get a doc to prescribe:

Gabapentin. Removes most withdrawal symptoms, works really well. Apparently clonidine works very well too but I've never taken it. I would take these over specialized medications for withdrawal that are opiate based themselves and have their own withdrawals any day.

Can be ordered online:

Kratom is a plant based substance you can order online, stacking this with weed and gabapentin will actually make you feel good during withdrawal. Watch the dosages tho might be dangerous for some people.


Now me I'm dealing with post acute tiredness mostly and not feeling to do anything, I ordered absolute focus from bright rain which has nooptronics. It has adrafinil, Citiconline, phenylpyracetam, noonept. Removes all fatigue but don't recommend using everyday. It's good to use it to work out and have a few functional days in your week


Apparently passion flower helps a lot with sleep. I just got some and took some to sleep. I think it helped.


Can you guys recommend supplements that take u better to normal quicker during post acute?

I made it many days into the supposed benzo withdrawal, but only a few into the fent withdrawal before becoming violently Ill. I acquired Suboxone and took about 24-48- hours after last dose which threw me into precipitated withdrawal. I had passed out and was delirious, open eye visuals and hallucinations, by the time I finally let my wife take me to the hospital (package was coming next day or may have gone sooner). Hospital said I was extremely dehydrated and starved and that my heart rate started to get out of control, almost a heart attack.

Things aren‚Äôt the same now. After ICU, I was in a psych hospital for 10 days where they gave me 4 days Suboxone and very occasionally an Ativan.After since the ICU stay, my muscles were extremely weak, had to relearn to walk almost, most of my body feels numb, feeling nerve pain and more pain than ever before. Not to EVEN mention the exacerbating of multiple existing mental illnesses.I have lost my sense of smell from snorting. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything they can give me that really helps and they didn‚Äôt taper me well at all,on either the benzos or opiates. Three day taper, really? When I spent a decade building this habit?

I don‚Äôt even care about benzos much. I love opiates. I‚Äôm really struggling with staying sober. As an alternative to relapsing, I‚Äôve been considering going to a methadone clinic, but I‚Äôm not sure what their intake days are, or even if they‚Äôll dose me because currently I have none in my system (do they blood/piss test?). Would I have to relapse to get on methadone? Also is there a reliable site/directory of methadone clinics, especially if there is just someone I can talk to who can tell me about the process at that specific clinic. Also how long does it take to get a week or even a few days of takehomes? I‚Äôm willing to drop every other drug if I can get on methadone because I need an opiate to function and I‚Äôm going to lose everything if I can‚Äôt function. And very soon.

While things have been getting better in some way, physically I feel a bit better, but mentally I‚Äôm still wishing that I was dead, unable to do things, constant fight or flight response 24/7 except when I pass out, then wake up not feeling rested.

Any advice please is appreciated.",5

However, since getting clean again (about 40 days ago now), I've had terrible diarrhea pretty much every single day.

I've been taking Loperamide every single day now for a week and the diarrhea has not improved at all. This might be a stupid quesiton, but could Vivitrol be blocking the effects of the Loperamide? From my limited knowledge on the matter, I didn't think Loperamide crossed the blood brain barrier anyway and only acted on the gut, so I assumed it would work. Yet it has been completely ineffective.

I am only taking normal doses of it and strictly using it for help with diarrhea but it hasn't seemed to help at all. Sorry if this was an idiotic question but I couldn't think of where else to ask it and Google is basically useless.",2

Well, I was down to using about 6 gram per day, which meant that I could literally go days without anything and not notice any withdrawals (im fortunate). 

Well, during a break from class, I just started to develop this craving for something ELSE. Something MORE. I tried everything to break this craving, EXCEPT tell anyone. After 18 months of being free from hardcore opiates, i decided to give into the craving and went on a three day bender. 

I wound up getting destroyed by guilt and honestly, the high just wasnt that pleasurable and made me feel extremey shitty. 

After the bender, i wound up having to increase my kratom intake for 4 days, to 12-15 grams per day, cause my tolerance and everything got shocked hard.

No physical ailments or WD, wound up coming right back down to my previous kratom dose, able to go long periods of time again and suffer no WD (another bullet dodged). 

However, i find myself craving one last day of debauchery before school starts this upcoming tuesday. So, this entire week has been me jumping back and forth from ‚ÄúJust a day, you recovered fine from the last use‚Äù to, ‚Äúno way in hell im risking this‚Äù. Cognitively, this is draining and disheartening.

I usually re center myself but the cravings are depressing the hell out of me. I practice mindfulness and meditation, so usually i do a sitting or walking meditation but lately, the cravings seem to be getting stronger.

When i ride the cravings and urge, allow me to feel it and try not to get attached, i seem to get the most relief, but they still keep coming. Im at such an amazing place in my life: school, career, inter-personal relationships, fitness etc. etc. i cant seem to make a definitive decision about whether I wanna party tonight and have it be my last before school starts up. However, i know this line of thinking is strengthening ore existing neural pathways. 

What should i do? What advice can you give this confused man lol.

An hour later I had what I would call a short duration hot flash and slight sweating that lasted less than 20 min. But now feel no withdrawal but do not feel better or ""good"". I would have thought I would be feeling better as I take more subs at this point??

How am I doing at this point and can anyone give me any suggestions on how to continue at this point? Keep dosing on subs every couple hours, etc.?

I haven‚Äôt posted any updates or summaries in two weeks, simply because i wanted to use those two weeks to really dig into myself and take the time to realize why i chose to go the opiate direction and the core of that huge issue. The answer to those questions/that curiosity hasn‚Äôt been found, but I will say I feel as if i‚Äôve gained some wisdom due to the constant battle going on mentally to not use ever again and not throw away the hard work I did not for just anybody, but for my own self and my own well-being. Once I realized that this isn‚Äôt a battle of beating physical ‚Äúwithdrawal‚Äù but a battle of relapse and long-term solutions, I sought an addiction specialist doctor and luckily he saw me the next day. Once I told him my story and where my mind is at and what direction i‚Äôm moving towards, he concluded that it‚Äôs best for me to start on 2mg Sub strips twice a day. I was skeptical at first, but I understand this is a marathon and not a sprint and I must become stable with solid clean time first to then start tapering off of the Subs and leave any and all medications behind. I like to think I have tons of knowledge about Subs, as I spent 4 months reading about them almost every day out of sheer curiosity during my habit. But even then I‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm still missing so much, not the point though i‚Äôm veering off a bit‚Ä¶ I asked the doctor why start me on Subs if i‚Äôve already beat this devil, and he told me something that i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll carry with me for the rest of my life. ‚ÄúYou already let the devil in your house, you can‚Äôt beat it. You need time to learn it, to understand it, to befriend it. This ‚Äúdevil‚Äù is something you have to learn to live with, function with, can‚Äôt just kick it out of the house. Once you master your OWN actions even with the devil in your house, then you‚Äôll stop viewing it as the ‚Äúdevil‚Äù and treat it just like any other obstacle in life.‚Äù It‚Äôs not like what he said hasn‚Äôt ran through my mind before, but hearing it vocally from my doc helped immensely for some reason. My goal is to avoid relapsing altogether, but my mind is still weak from all the things i‚Äôve put it through during my habit/withdrawal. For that reason, and that reason alone, my Doc put me on Subs. I kept asking if we can keep the dosage to a minimum just because i don‚Äôt want to keep being reliant on something to function on the daily, and I was granted that wish. After assuring me that he‚Äôll monitor me closely with weekly check-ups/weekly drug tests (which i‚Äôm completely fine with) and telling me that he won‚Äôt up my dose unless i‚Äôm not noticing any difference/improvement, he went on to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre one of the very, very few, who walk through our clinic door and genuinely want control of their life back. most just come in looking for solutions to their physical withdrawals with the intention to continue using without the consequences. the minute you came to my office i noticed your intentions are harmless, and you are willing to work for who you once were. you have my word that once we are done here, you‚Äôll be twice the man you were before meeting this ‚Äúdevil‚Äù.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure you can all imagine just how happy that made me‚Ä¶ To hear something of that sort from a DOCTOR, and not just your loved ones that are there supporting you to make your brain feel healthy and worthy again.

That happened 11 days ago, now i‚Äôm on Day 21, 3 weeks:) To say that it‚Äôs been ‚Äúeasy‚Äù would be a fat f*ckin LIE, but i keep telling myself mentally that this is a piece of cake and that I‚Äôm capable of doing this because it‚Äôs what i WANT‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs worked a treat guys, by telling myself this is a piece of cake, it has actively become a piece of cake‚Ä¶ take what I say with a grain of salt, because I do have moments, at least 5 times a day, where I remind myself how far I‚Äôve come and how hard I‚Äôve worked for it and how it can all be gone by just an HOUR of unforgivable stupidity. To avoid giving myself even a chance at an hour of unforgivable stupidity, I‚Äôve been keeping myself extremely busy with everything that I might want to do. Not to mention out of the past 21 days, i‚Äôve went to the gym and got an active workout in for 18 of those days. Here‚Äôs the kicker: I haven‚Äôt missed a day in SIXTEEN DAYS.

I'd love to just stop and use comfort meds, in the past I've had gabapentin which was great at stopping most WD symptoms, I wonder if that will be an option? In the past though it wasn't prescribed and I got it from other sources.

I‚Äôm a 10-12+ year opiate user, majority heroin and now fent.  a year or two back I made a serious effort to stop IV usage and taper dosage.  road that for a while and met who i can only describe as my soul mate (who also has three young kids and no real drug habits to speak of).  she lived 6 hours away at the time so majority of initial relationship was remote with some flights in at least once a month to see if things were as real as they seemed.  they were and i decided to jump off the fentadope before becoming a real part of her and her kids lives and went cold turkey. three months into that process i still felt super ill and the situation called for just getting my ass local to her and just finding detox/medical assistance in her area. so i went onto just oxy pills at a premium price (read required doses every 4-6 hours and basically broke as fuck).  setup all the doctor appointments and turns out this region of the country has dick for recovery resources.   also, due to covid, getting appointments to see anyone took forever.  at that point, made the decision to go back to the fent (making a 12+ hr trip to my old plugs to avoid meeting anyone local).  

all that brings us to here. i finally found a doctor that was willing to script out a few days of subs for induction. whatever fentalog i‚Äôm taking doesn‚Äôt pop on urine screens so who knows what it actually is but have been maintaining 2x/day dosage every 12 hours to just maintain. 

finally have subs in had this week and was told 48-72 hours before taking first sub dose (2mg to be increased every hour up to 6mg) depending how i‚Äôm feeling.  

last dose of fent was 48 hours ago and besides the lethargy, sneezing, irritability and random dry heaving, this is no where near full blown withdrawal. 

feels like at this point PWD is going to be unavoidable if i stick to the schedule the doc prescribed.  

to complicate things, my girl just had a major surgery and her recovery has been plagued with complication after complication and she really has no one else to really help with the kids.

that‚Äôsgot me now looking into bermese method of induction in hopes that maybe i‚Äôll be able to be at least somewhat closer to a normal human being to help around the house while she has to fight yet another infection.

i know that‚Äôs a lot to read but any feedback is helpful.

I'm in the UK here so my codeine comes from over the counter meds, things like Solpadeine, Nurofen, Co Codamol.. whatever has codeine in it, I take it..

I bit the bullet just before Christmas and phoned my GP asking for help and instead of support, I got scolded like a child and was told ""you need to be helping yourself, there's nothing much we can do"" and I felt so deflated. I eventually got a letter through the door asking me to complete a form for the addiction clinic referral and I instantly binned it. The main reason: it asked me about my kids and there was a possibility of social services intervention which I was not allowing to happen.

I function in life fine, I hold a full time job and own my house. But lately, I feel like such a disgrace.

I am spending an absolute fortune on codeine, especially now that the prices have gone up so much. I wake up and instantly feel like I need to take tablets otherwise I feel like shit. I just want to stop, like I just desperately want to stop.

I don't know if cold turkey is possible, has anyone tried doing a taper plan before? Or is there anything that can supplement the taper/withdrawal?

Any help from you guys is going to be so appreciated, I just really really need to quit this shit.

Hey all. I‚Äôm posting here because I figure many of us have been/may be on gabapentin at some point in the recovery process. I started taking gabapentin a little less than a year ago. I was prescribed it at RCA while I was there for detox from subs + fent and finally got relief from my WD symptoms. I remember one of the RA‚Äôs telling me that it helps so much but that the withdrawal is horrible. Can‚Äôt remember exactly how she worded it but it was worrisome. However I continued on it anyway because at the time I was no longer on MAT and it was helping a lot. 

Come a year later, and I‚Äôve gained almost 40 pounds, when I‚Äôve rarely ever fluctuated in weight by more than 5-10 lbs. My eating habits were crappy and of course getting sober you put on some lbs, but 40 is a fucking lot for someone who already suffers from intense body dysmorphia and restrictive eating habits, etc., I‚Äôve always been hyper aware of my weight. Then my doctor finally said to me at my last sub appt, that it makes you gain weight and I immediately asked to taper down. 

I‚Äôve always been horrible at following drs ordered tapers. I went from taking 1200mg a morning, to 400 mg a morning since my last appt (12/23), and I‚Äôve yet to take my dose today. I know, I suck, and I should follow the doctors orders. My ED and self consciousness immediately told me I need to get off of this shit before I gain a single lb more. 

So - have you experienced WD from gabapentin? How bad was it if so? And how long did it last? Comfort meds that may help? Thanks all in advance! I‚Äôm celebrating over 6 months clean from fent and I am so proud!",1

Does this mean that people that were addicted ONLY to oxycodone/opiates arent true alcoholics / drug addicts?
Are they more like the Jordan Peterson ‚Äúdrug dependent‚Äù type where their body became physiologically addicted / dependent to it?

I feel like true drug addicts and alcoholics  only apply to those that cannot stop using once they start. Like on non physically addictive  drugs such as  meth, cocaine, marijuana.  
So is it possible for a person that had problems with opiates to recreationally use other substances even physically addctive drugs like xanax?   For instance Im able to get some bars and put it down to draw the line on not risking physical Addiction.  Because i know for me, once I get hooked on bars its hard to stop because of the WD, not the psychologically addiction aspect. It is different for drugs like oxycodone for me because there is a strong pull to it and it being the magic cure when you‚Äôre ‚Äúsick‚Äù



I personally feel like opiates are addictive to everyone in society ,  not only to the ‚Äútextbook‚Äú alcoholics or drug addicts or 20% subset of ‚Äúaddicts‚Äù.  i feel like ANYONE, if given a script of oxycodone or if they were forced to take it for 30 days straight where the dose kept getting raised, they would all be opiate addicts.   More so with fentanyl.  But i feel like most same people would be able to stop no problem if it was alcohoL, cocaine, Meth or marijuana.  Not the case with the worlds most physically addictive drugs that cause violent withdrawals that only alleviate with the substance

Bitches are!,"About 8 years ago I met a girl at work she was sexy and seemed nice enough. I eventually found out she had an aversion to the truth. I'm a nursing assistant so a hardworking girl who was sweet and appeared to show genuine care towards patients was a big plus for me. A good girl who was sexy with the right proportions A++. What I had come to find out shortly into our relationship  was she was married for 8 years with a child. She worked 60hrs a week the rest of the time she was shacked up with me. She did what girls do said he was mean controlling and abusive. The truth was he was a good man raising her daughter while she was getting high and fucking anyone she could, women love to be wanted by men. I was prescribed xanax which I barely took. She must have really cared about the environment  cuz she helped me recycle them. I stopped taking them cuz I was worried about her so she chugged gabapentin  and hydroxizine and whatever pain pills she could get her hands on. I gave her an ultimatum her husband or me she chose neither and texted me night and day telling me she loved me. The last time she texted me was to tell me she got heroin I told her she's a fucking idiot and to lose my number she died the next day.

  Shortly after my grief had subsided I met another girl she was cute and sweet and an excellent worker. Eventually she told me she had been on suboxone for over 5 yrs. She didn't put a gun to my head but also didn't discourage me from taking them. We had a child together than she got on vyvanse and adderall but her Achilles heel was you guessed it xanax. She went on benzo binges several times in the last five years and endangered our sons life. Things finally came to an end recently. She insisted she was out of xanax and done taking them. So I looked at her phone and seen a brand new message from an online pharmacy that said 60 bars of xanax had been delivered. She Came After me like a bat out of hell and punched me several times to get her phone back. I told her to stop and said no. I was mad so I threw her phone and she shoved me one more time so I ran over and grabbed her phone. She chased me full speed up the stairs to the kitchen. She kept punching me ( I had her phone in my right hand and blocked her punches with my left). Then her mom who I had telling all day that her daughter needs rehab came from behind me and put me in a choke hold. I swung her off me while dropping the phone and she fell to one knee.

    From there my girlfriend was full blown trying to hurt me its all I could do to protect myself while not hurting her I tried to get away. Before I could her mom grabbed a large knife and raised it towards me instinctively I grabbed it and felt the blade pierce through my flesh. I yelled for her mom to drop it 3 or 4 times all while her daughter was still attacking me. Finally I punched her mom in the side of the face twice and she dropped the knife. The fight ended there and I called 911 after I received 7 stitches in the hospital. A warrant was issued for my arrest. I spent the night im County and I am charged with 2 counts of simple assault. 

  The police report basically says I beat the shit out of my girlfriend ( No injuries were observed on my girlfriend)  I had a cut open hand and black eye and her mom had bruising on the side of her face which I had explained to the officers.

I tried to do a VERY rapid taper once my dealers supplier got popped and he told me he wouldn‚Äôt be good for over a week and I had a bag and a half in my wallet. I stretched that out 3 days. After the final bump within 24 hours on Christmas Day it started. And over the course of the next 3 days I went into hell, heart pounding, anxiety, limbs kicking and tingling, shitting nonstop, dry heaving, unable to keep anything down but soup after day 2. Pure hell. Fast forward to last Friday, I reached out to an addiction doctor he told me take my last bag Saturday and come see him Monday morning. So I had 1 and a half bags at that point. Mind you I went through a bun a day on a 3 day bender that week after the previous hell. So I do my one bag Friday and half a bag 8am Saturday. So I go to see him, he gives me the cocktail of cocktails. Subutex, Gabba, clonidine, lunesta, Xanax, loperamide, soma, and even anti nausea medication used by fucking chemo patients. So I start them. Needless to say it knocked me the fuck out and spend a day and night in bed.

My addiction journey began like so many of yours.  After a somewhat normal dental surgery around the age of 20, a 10-day prescription to oxycodone, 15yrs later - here we are.  I was aware of my predisposition to alcoholism and addiction at an early age.  I had big dreams and even bigger goals for my life.  I'm a full blown empath/healer and natural born leader. I'm a fucking warrior.  However, my best god given skills and talents have been on hold, hiding dormant, waiting for the fog to lift as many times as it takes but, I'm here.  I'm alive.  I'm an addict in recovery.

Buprenorphine - a godsend to many for numerous reasons and a ball and chain to others.   My commander and chief after years of perpetual consumption of any/all narcotics , and years of isolation despite being surrounded by loving family/friends,  I continued to suffer in silence with out an ounce of hope remaining that I could escape this with my life.  I had earned and received  the highly stigmatized and misunderstood title of addict.  This is who I am now...

As seasoned addicts often do, a determination is made that in order to function in society, the only way to do so is by way of a maintenance drug made especially for us degenerate, weak-willed addicts  (as we're so often described).  At the time I didn't understand what it would cost or how much more damage was to be done.  That was, until it had removed every last ounce of life force that remained in this shell of a body.

During this time,  I was able to hold down a career in a challenging engineering field, I was married, bought a house, and have a beautiful 6yr old son.  I did it! I beat this! No. Not even close. I'm ashamed to tell you that the best moment in my life wasn't the day I held my boy for the first time - If you're an addict, I don't have to finish this statement - you all understand what I'm getting at.  Irrespective, I handed all of these beautiful things away willingly one by one, each one taking out the next like shallow rooted trees hopelessly fighting the wind and it is only after the storm subsides do we realize, the loss, and unforgiving damage that is done.  So, as we do, low doses, tapering, planning, strategizing, prepping for the big jump to get sober and reclaim a life lost.  Wait a minute, is that hope creeping back in?  I'm not sure but I'm committed - I can do this. Oh my fuck - I'm sick as a rabid fucking dog, and then I'm post acutely symptomatic for months.  This is too much.  Am I defective? Can I do this? Doubt, shame, defeat. Relapse. Abyss.

After numerous failed attempts at sobriety over the last 15 years, and all the chaos created and done unto those who mean the most to me, I surrendered.  I surrendered myself to God, the universe, the divine - call it what you wish.  Not two weeks later, on the exact date of 1/1/2022.  I had received my response.  Any and all avenues for me to use had become undone seemingly overnight.  All the money I had to my name was out of reach, and it was now clear that I was being given a chance to forge a new path - a new way forward and the only cost for admission was surrendering to it and to be present for every single bit of the fight ahead.  And so, I battled alone in a bed in a basement.  I let myself feel every damned bite of the devil during that time. Blow after blow surrender after surrender, and just as I began to doubt, the fog began to slowly lift.  Every passing day, bringing more and more life-force back into my being.  I'm not my mind.  I'm not my body.  I exist independently and can flourish.  Surrender yourself, feel the pain, and put and end to the silent suffering. You are powerful.

&#x200B;

God bless all of you,

Like, what if I got in a kinda bad car accident or something where I had a few broken bones and just got smashed up.  I don't have any kind of drug use, rx or otherwise on my record, so Dr's wouldn't see me as any kind of special risk for abuse or anything, but I know they are extremely hesitant giving any kind of narcotics to anyone these days, so I just wonder what that would be like.  I assume this sensitivity thing will ease up eventually, at least I hope so, and would appreciate hearing anyone's experience with that.  How long am I likely to have to deal with this?  Does it definitely go away eventually?  Also just curious if anyone has experienced any real trauma while withdrawing or even post-addiction, is it worse?

However, I hit my 6-month milestone free of opiates of all kinds in two days. It has been a very rough journey and I still have using dreams nightly and of course when I get upset I have an immediate response to go out to the streets to find a dealer out there.

I've heard from some that methadone is trading one addiction for another because of the needing it daily for feeling normal. But in your opinions would it be a viable option for someone who still has the cravings very badly at times? My mental instability with my psychiatric illnesses make it even harder to stay clean, I do not know how I have done it for this long. Longest I have been sober in a row since I have been 12 years old.

I have severe OCD, PTSD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a multitude of other comorbidities. I take a benzo (5mg diazepam) currently for my extreme anxiety panic attacks and night terrors. I have seen that the mixing of the two medications is highly disputed with doctors who do not want to cause any respiratory problems within a patient taking both a benzo and an opiate.

So I suppose that brings it down to my question, for the sake of staying sober should I get on methadone and treat my addiction that way, although knowing it would take away my anxiety medication. Or should I stay on the anxiety medication because I have such severe panic attacks I cannot leave my home.

I would appreciate anyone who has any comments regarding my questions. Thank you all very much for reading. I hope you stay sober, stay wonderful, and stay beautiful. Peace and love. ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",3

That is correct. But kratom saved my life and if it weren‚Äôt for kratom I would 100000% still be addicted. 

I‚Äôm just gonna say it‚Ä¶ kratom is a miracle plant. It nearly took my withdraws away. I had relapsed a couple times before I found out about kratom and I found out about it the 3rd time I was gonna try to get clean and the last time (I‚Äôm 100 days sober now) and it saved my life. Withdraws we‚Äôre kicking my ass I was so sick and I just felt like I was dying. I drove my ass to the smoke shop and picked up some green maeng da and I was amazed. I was amazed that 6 of these capsules just changed my life and helped take 80% of my withdrawals away and make them feel manageable. 

Some people say kratom withdraws are on the same level as real opiods. I‚Äôm sorry but coming from a 120-150 mg a day oxy user for years this is just not true. The withdraws can get bad and they most definitely are uncomfortable if you use kratom everyday (and for a lot of people they can just stop cold turkey and not have any withdraws At all). But they are in no way shape or form on the same level as a heavy opiod addiction. All I‚Äôm saying is don‚Äôt scare people away from trying kratom to ease their withdraws and get off real opiods with saying things like ‚Äúkratom is just another opiod‚Äù or ‚Äúthe withdraws will be so so severe‚Äù.

Kratom saved my life and many others. It really is a miracle plant and I don‚Äôt even say that about weed.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt think I would have to add this. Everyone is different everyone‚Äôs body is different. I‚Äôm just trying to help people so their withdrawals don‚Äôt feel like they are dying and they can find something more natural that MOST people find easier to get off of then opiods if you even have withdraws at all. I know by saying ‚Äúmiracle plant‚Äù I might have had people think I‚Äôm saying kratom comes with NO negative effects but with literally everything it can.",10

Have been abusing after originally getting prescribed for severe pain. Been on between 80mg-140mg a day, I know that's a wide range it just really depended on what I had. On it for around 10 months. 

Day 1 - first full day without morphine taking my last dose the evening before around half 6 at night, the daystarted with and continued through with muscle aches, watery eyes, extreme fatigue.

Day 2- woke up after limited sleep, dreamt I already gave up so for a brief few seconds upon waking I though I could have one. Snapped out of it, muscle aches today are far worse. Vomiting and gastro stuff going on. Emotions all over the place random crying, feeling of embarrassment and worthlessness. The fatigue has not been quite as prevalent which is what made me thing maybe I was getting though it, but it's returned and that's all I am up to.

We've been talking in depth about getting clean and actually were successful with the Bernese method in September. We weren't aware that we were also addicted to some sort of synthetic benzo (again) and the benzo withdrawal ultimately made us decide to pick up dope again because both at once was so difficult, and we'd thought it'd be easy to Bernese through again. I have court soon and will be on probation for a DUI so it's not even an option for me, I need to quit. He's known this since August and I thought we were on the same page. Now it's crunch time and he is constantly whining and complaining, and in my opinion being overly dramatic. It's always been me working and my money, now I'm not working to focus on getting clean, I can't help him get shit. He's mentioned suicide and has been really depressed, just constantly reminding me of how much agony he's in. Even though we've just run out of shit and I KNOW that he's not actually in withdrawal yet. He's being a manipulative junkie, I've been there too. But I just don't know what to do. How to help him when I need to help myself, but he's clearly relying on me to come up with all the answers (which has always kind of been our dynamic). We've been together for 13 years, it's not like our relationship was founded with a common interest in drugs or anything like that. Ive always suffered from depression and anxiety and relied on his care free, laid back attitude to help get me out of funks. I'm confident in myself to do this on my own, but he's making it so much more difficult. I don't want to abandon him or send him off, but I don't think I can continue living with him if he's using (and definitely don't want to pay for it!) 

Sorry for the long ass post, but looking for advice from people that have been in similar situations or can relate in some way, because I don't know any other using couples that didn't have to break up to stay sober. And that's really not what I want if it doesn't have to be that way. I know it'll be a journey to get back to reality. But we were so happy and proud of ourselves that few weeks clean.

A little backstory: Got sick back in 2018, with body pains and chronic fever. Started tramadol as the doctors couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong. Initially got prescribed for the pain, but quickly found out that it also helped with the cold sweats from fever. For a while. The last two years I‚Äôve been sweating and freezing every day. Convinced that the tramadol helped, but I don‚Äôt think so anymore.

When I quit cold turkey on monday, my sweats disappeared. Immediately. BUT the cold and chills got much worse. It‚Äôs of course to be expected when having withdrawals. I‚Äôve had to wear double layer of wool and sitting with a heating blanket all the time. 

Now, when the anxiety and insomnia is better, the chills are much worse. Leading me into panic attacks. I do take a lot of showers and everything I can do, but I‚Äôm very restricted. 

So my question is; I know it will linger, but will it get better soon? I mean, not constantly. I know it‚Äôs different for everyone, but I‚Äôd appreciate hearing about your experiences!",5

I haven‚Äôt slept in 5 days‚Ä¶ Even with  the following comfort meds- alprazolam, gaba, Imodium , etc. This is my biggest issue as I‚Äôm starting to feel like the machinest, and with work coming up on Monday I NEED SLEEP. Entire full bars have not helped at this point and it‚Äôs really starting to weigh me down.

2. Took a sub yesterday, but like I said felt like it was too far in the process to even take as I was on day 6. Did give me energy last night to have chats and whatnot but feel like shit again.. which brings me to my last question..

3. Found an oxy in my comfort med bottle. Now, if I can get sleep tonight it‚Äôs getting tossed, however, if I can‚Äôt would taking the sub yesterday and then taking the oxy tn JUST FOR SOME SLEEP, would put me into a PWD or another bad scenario? Would wait the entire 24 hours since my last piece of fiIm, and I  promise I have no other pills on me and I‚Äôm not trying to ask- ‚Äúhey everyone I made it a week I earn a pill‚Äù. I will never want that sickness again ever in my life, but I REALLY NEED SLEEP GUYS :(. Im taking 2-4 MGs of alprazolam and nothing. 

If anyone can help a brother out I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Can‚Äôt miss any work and need to get on with my life and sleep!!

Thanks in advance to anyone and everyone who shares insight!!

My question is has anyone used subutex after using fet for a a few months? I‚Äôm worried that 36-48 hours isn‚Äôt going to be enough to properly be deep enough in WD to avoid precip?

How can I get off this? 

I weened down in 2021 and was completely off any pain killers and all medication. Quit weed and was 100% sober unless you count cigarettes and coffee. But my brain function was ridiculous. I felt special needs. I felt absolutely retarded. Couldn‚Äôt form coherent sentences. Couldn‚Äôt hold normal conversations. Came across like I had Down syndrome. I couldn‚Äôt handle it so I went back on and instantaneously I went back to feeling normal and even better than normal due to the Tolerance break. 80mg had me nodding like I was going to overdose. It was nice for a few months but now I‚Äôm back to the same spot. I take 80mg a day but when I get my script refilled I take the extra 40 a day I‚Äôm supposed to be taking and get high by taking 9x40mg all in one mouthful. 


I‚Äôm scared to go off them again due to the‚Äùbrain damage‚Äù, is that what it is?! And also my muscular skeletal diseases. The pain‚Ä¶ mentally AND physically.

I've always assumed a COWS score >15 was a cold, hard requirement for Suboxone induction, but I Just did a little research on this and found a study abstract ([https://www.jabfm.org/content/34/Supplement/S141](https://www.jabfm.org/content/34/Supplement/S141)) that describes the process. In short, you taper-up from small to larger doses of Suboxone while still using full agonist opioids. After 7 days you reach a maintenance level on the subs and begin to taper off the full opiates over the course of a 4-week period.

I have several questions about this for those of you who have done it...

Since we all know that some level of Suboxone will cause precipitated WD for people on full agonist opiates, what is it like to start taking these small doses of Suboxone a little at a time while still using opiates? Was there any level of PWD? RLS, GI issues, runny nose, watery eyes, sleeplessness, general discomfort? If so, when did you start to feel it? How extreme was it? How long did it last?

I also wonder how much you were still feeling the effects of the opiates once you started the 7-day micro-induction process. Did you still experience an elevated feeling immediately after use on day 2 or day 3? I assume that at some point the subs fully take over your opiate receptors and block all effects of any opiates you consume after that point. If so, on what day did you get there? Did you feel any continuing need to use opiates after that point? The study I read said that the participants decreased their opiate use by 25% per week for 4 weeks after the end of the micro-induction period. I don't understand the point of this if these opiates are being fully blocked at that point.

Last question: I have always had sleep problems on the first night or two after starting on Suboxone. Did you experience insomnia during the micro-induction period or beyond?

Really interested in hearing about your experience. Thank you very much! Hope all is well.",2

Day 2: 2 .5mg
Day 3: 2 1mg
Day 4: 2 2mg
Day 5: 2 3mg
Day 6: 2 4mg

They have been effective for me. Let's go over the best OTC ( Over the counter) medicine ,herbs and remedies for people to get through detox and paws.","Lavendar- Coupled with hot baths helped immensely. Not recommended but I went and stole a ton of lavendar shit I was so desperate. Not proud of it but it is what it is.

Magnesium - I found did help with RLS

Vitamins- vitamins definitely help. Being I'm the unhealthy junky I am, in week or two you'll feel a difference. 

Loperamide- Helps with stomach issues. Don't take too much.

Menthol - used in the hot bath. Does help IMO if only temporarily 

HOT TEA - sleepy teas coupled with some other things for sleep knock me the fuck out. Junky want immediate relief and may not wanna try. It works. 

Chamomile- also can be drunk as tea but I use essential oil for baths really helps. I like baths can you tell?.

Kratom- a controversial but effective one IMO...I suggest savings for nights only when RLS is demonic and you couple this with the other stuff here. It works. I got a train wreck straind from Krave. Beware extracts will get you addicted. I would say for a real opi addict 6 caps of kratom is a good start most 10 caps  at a time every 12 hours imo.

Exercise- You won't feel like doing shit. Do it if possible if you have a gym membership get there at some point and try to move a little bit.

Streaming Services - Find something to occupy the mind. I notice scrolling non stop on a phone can be bad. Phones will also stop your sleep too. Preferably a bigger screen like TV or comp will be ideal 

Sauna/Hotbaths - I find sauna helps even if I feel like shit and everyone wonders why I'm so skinny at my gym. People only day it doesn't make you detoxify... I'd like to disagree.

NA / Aa zoom meetings - look , don't @ me on this one.. if anything It will get you through the hour and that I promise. Don't wanna hear negative opinions on this. I believe we need people connecting to get rid of our old selves and fix drug addiction.

WATER!!!!- HYDRATE HYDRATE your body is fucked. It needs water. It's not rocket science. 

Fruit - yes fruit is good for you  It will hydrate you and it will give you some vitamins and also a boost of sugar that will hit your dopamine system. 

Real food- Real healthy food. Explains itself its not rocket science.

Popsicles - Eat it in the hot bath. Gives a morale boost.

Melatonin- I like the gummy ones. 

Rice in a sock- you can microwave raw rice in a sock and it gets hot. You can use it like a stress ball. While your rocking back in forth in pain.  I like to heat it up and put it under my nuts when I'm freezing Hey it is what it is

Heating pads- yea heating pads for when your freezing.

Marijuana- another controversial one.  I don't really care what your opinions of this are (ethically or morally) should I say?  I find marijuana helped me immensely especially at night when I'm freaking out trying to sleep with RLS. Anytime I would wake up and smoke some weed take a little kratom  take a lavender bath I did get to sleep after a long fucking time but Hey at least you'll get some relief. 
EDIT: I DONT CARE TO ARGUE ETHICS OR IF ITS SOBRIETY I THINK IS. BECAUSE OFF HURT BUTTS.

Real Aa/na meetings-  It is corny at this point I don't give a fuck I am going to do whatever I need to do to get past this drug addiction do it it will make you feel better it makes my spirit feel better your soul never felt good?

There is lots of more shit I can think of I just don't have all day to sit here and do this shit for free and also I'm not feeling the greatest myself still.. Also there is illegal shit or stuff you can take from a MD.  I would like to have people beware last time I went to my primary care physician and told her about my problem all she did was cut me off any current meds that I was on and told me she could not help me so be aware of what you tell your primary care physician. If you're on xanax or ambien and you go to your DR. and tell them you're taking heroin they will cut you off they have too so be aware of that.

Now I would like to say one last thing about xanax benzos et cetera they do help however with me when I'm on xanax I will go get some meth or a bag eventually because my intentions  are lowered so beware of that it is a demon it can come out to get you secretly especially on benzos .. also if you can get a hotel far away while detoxin that is ideal especially a nice 1 seems like a nice ass hotel's boozy hotels make me feel a little better for some reason I don't know why... you can Uber eats you can insta cart ... you can get  all that shit to your hotel room if you have the money...  if not do what you gotta do I believe in you, I love you  , good fucking luck and get rid of this devil please.

Anything I forgot please mention. I'm forever learning as well. Also I'm sure there are alot of typos and misspelled words. I don't care you get this jist.  I am doing this to help people, not to get points on reddit. Any misspells you're just gonna have to deal with because I'm only on a cell phone. 
Edit: I didn't wanna write it because I don't feel 100% but ultimately I did write it because it's important and I did want to.... if that makes sense??

This sub was my best friend on those sleepless nights and 100 hour days. So if you‚Äôre like me, sitting in the background and not trying to get too involved with the sub. I applaud you. Do what you have to until you feel comfortable enough to actually come clean with the pep you love and care about. It‚Äôs pretty shocking how much support is actually out there. Never give up, it‚Äôs basically learn to live clean or die with all this dirty shit.",42

BACKSTORY
My boyfriend has 10 years of heroin addiction he‚Äôs struggled with /when we got together he was sober for the longest time he had ever been (in 10 years) he was sober for over 2 years. During the beginning of the pandemic he relapsed a couple times and I was chatting with a friend who gave me a bottle of suboxones to give to him if he felt triggered instead of using street drugs. (Over doses here are at an all time high and I was worried about him getting the wrong batch) 
Flash forward 2? Years later. & he got hooked on subs and then moved on to street drugs and is currently the most addicted me & any of his close friends and family have ever seen him be. Using fentanyl/& speed every day spending around $50 a day and spending all his time downtown. I‚Äôm at my wits end, (Being 100% sober from everything myself)
Ok so here‚Äôs my QUESTION : He refuses to go to rehab (11% success rate here and super expensive/even with referrals and government ones) 
We created a plan together for him to taper, in the last couple of weeks he‚Äôs gone from $50 a day to 20$, puts his dosage in a lock box, scales it and puts the amounts in a weekly pill container with lower dosages every week, but I read on here that dosent really work (weak batch and poof) 
Do you think it would be better for him to just get on suboxones and taper that over time? (Safer! In my mind) but with the history idk. What the heck helped you get sober? I‚Äôve stayed with him detoxing around 5+ and poof one day he‚Äôs gone, back downtown again.",2

2022-01-05 21:00:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/rx30n2/minimal_suboxone_maintenance_period/,Minimal Suboxone Maintenance Period,"I understand most doctors typically prescribe 1-2 years of suboxone maintenance before any taper period. However, I have read post after post from long-term suboxone users warning how hard it is to taper off after prolonged usage. I know that suboxone is supposed to be only a part of a larger process designed to put the right kind of lifestyle and support system in place when the patient is ready to jump off subs for good, and this takes time. My question relates to the minimal time frame for effective maintenance before tapering off. Setting all other considerations aside, can you do a 4-6 week maintenance period and then a 3-week taper and have a reasonable expectation of positive results? I do understand the importance of the other elements of MAT, but I am strictly talking pharmacology here. The obvious benefit would be the relative ease of walking away from it after such short-term use versus the standard 1-2+ year maintenance period. Highly interested in any experience-based feedback you can offer. Thank you.",4

This will likely be my only post on here. Just wanted to transcribe my thoughts and have something to reflect upon in the morning.

I don't know why I slipped. I think I wanted to play with the fire. Burnt up my savings and now I'm hoping I can can switch to subs in the morning.

I was a day shy of 9 months... And been daily using for a month now... And man is it just bewildering how much you throw away and how quickly you're back where you swore you never would be again...

Why do I want to get sober?
I like food. I like friends. I like the freedom of not being enslaved to a drug. I like not rolling the dice on my life. I like not having to watch my back for the police. I like being able to sleep at night. I like being able to feel human.

I'm tired of throwing my life away. I've realized it before, but the most invaluable thing we have in this world is time.. And opiates just eats away at any productivity and any semblance of a healthy and prosperous life..

I just don't understand how something so obvious as ""the stove is hot"" that I keep returning... Maybe I won't return this go around? Who's to say... But even knowing I throw everything away, I choose it, even though I choose it reluctantly so, the choice ends up being made.

Wish me luck as I try to switch to a sub taper in the morning. I've been ""trying"" for two weeks to switch but really I haven't ""tried""

I know eventually I'll find myself either seriously broke/in debt.. Or any other option that include continual use will bring me to my knees and EVENTUALLY I'll have to clean up that mess... Would rather clean up the a cup of milk than a gallon..

Anyways.. Thanks for letting me ramble. I hope each and every one of you know you are worthy of happiness and joy and thank you for the love you pour into this world.",5

Throughout most of the year I used probably two or three times a week until the last few months when I‚Äôve started using probably four days a week. This past month I‚Äôve used almost every day for exception of a few days here and there. With my usage I don‚Äôt re-dose, i use one dose. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù it to go about my day and get things done. I only use once a day ( in the evening when I get off work) usually 30mg and just play video games and it helps me fall asleep and relieves anxiety and stress that I have. I stopped using for a couple days earlier in the week and I don‚Äôt get any physical WD honestly other than fatigue and feeling out of it. My WD are alllll mental, I feel extremely bored and it feels like I can‚Äôt communicate as well, (when texting people I have nothing to talk about) and the main thing is I have trouble falling asleep. I also feel really moody when I don‚Äôt take them. I try to go to sleep and feel guilty or shame for using drugs because that‚Äôs not how I was raised and I hide it from everyone. I still end up using when I get off work I think I buy them really to help me sleep mostly because when I try to sleep when I don‚Äôt have them my mind starts racing and I get extreme fear and anxiety when falling asleep. Is this because of the psychological effects of WD? Do you think it would be easy for me to get off of them with my usage? My mental health is my biggest fear of getting off of them. 

I think the reason I haven‚Äôt stopped taking them is because I have control of not upping my dose (it‚Äôs always been one dosage A day when I use and it‚Äôs never more than 40mg) and I don‚Äôt experience physical WD but it‚Äôs definitely not good for my mental health.

It‚Äôs the very day I came to terms with my addiction. It‚Äôs the day I swore off any opiate for the rest of my life. I overdosed that morning, laying on my drug dealers floor face down without an ounce of life left in me. Let me tell you how I got there‚Ä¶

It was a normal morning, got up and put together my ‚Äòget my shit going‚Äô shot. This shot wasn‚Äôt much, 40cc of some low grade heroin. It was enough to get me out of my morning sickness, even though I had plenty of the shit to load up a 100cc if I wanted, but I had plans to score better. As the morning went on, I did my normal routine, shower, brushed my teeth, you get the idea, but I kept getting this aching feeling that I needed another shot. Not just a normal shot though, I wanted to make a goofball. Now clear isn‚Äôt something I normally go after, but the coffee just wasn‚Äôt doing me any sort of justice. I grab my gear, the essentials, and head over to the plugs. Once there, he unfortunately didn‚Äôt have what I was looking for, he didn‚Äôt even any brown either. Thought to myself what a damn bummer, but he said I was welcome to look around to see if any shards were just chilling. I looked around of course because, free drugs, and ended up finding a teaspoon lined with what I thought was clear. It was sitting in a tin with a clear pipe and a Cooley so I didn‚Äôt even question the substance. I took said spoon out to the kitchen where I had my gear set up and began the process. Loaded up my shit brown and cleaned the teaspoon out into my spoon. I wanted to make this shot big, so I did. It was around the 90cc range and boy was it nice and juicy. I decided to hit good old faithful and that was that. The initial rush was amazing, but once I had realized that there wasn‚Äôt any shortness of breath, or heavy lungs the way I describe it. I had known at that point it wasn‚Äôt clear I mixed in, it was‚Ä¶.BAM. Face down on the floor. Fentanyl. 

My buddy stayed with me, he couldn‚Äôt find any Narcan. I had some in my bag but he was too panicked to put a coherent thought together. He called 911, and preformed cpr until paramedics arrived. Several minutes passed, I think it was around 18-20, the paramedics show up and administered the first .4 mg narcan, and then another .4, until I finally came to. 

I woke up screaming for my mother. I‚Äôve never been more terrified in my life knowing what just happened. 

I‚Äôve been sober since.

I‚Äôm in a recovery program.

I thank god everyday for my second chance, but I also ask why?",12

Basically, I was a high functioning opioid addict for close to 15 years. I built, operated and ran a successful business and ran it like a machine. For a long time the opioids helped me in just about every aspect of running my company, i.e. work longer hours, increased my sociability and sales skills, training and team building, allowed me to complete and even enjoy more mundane tasks like book keeping, estimating, design, marketing, analytics, etc. and just overall was very involved in my business. Things did start getting tougher the last couple years when my habit got pretty excessive, I lost a solid oxy plug and the oxy all turned to pressed fent pills so I knew I needed to finally kick it once and for all when I hit 40.

I'm now over 10 months off opioids and overall I am much healthier; eating right, exercising, feeling pretty good more than half of the time, enjoying things more, and of course I am no longer risking my life and health, but I am struggling with  aspects of running my business and neglecting  other responsibilities. Shit, it's a struggle to want to even keep on top of my damn emails yet alone want to deal with customers, employees and certain other responsibilities that I need to be involved in. I just don't seem to want to deal with anything to do with my business or other responsibilities lately, I avoid things, put things off and am just not very reliable anymore which is not like me when it comes to my company. I use Adderall from time to time, but I don't like Adderall. I just use it as a crutch to catch up on the bare minimum of responsibilities every couple days or so.

As I am financially comfortable I feel like I would rather lose my company than get back on opioids, but of course it is in the back of my mind that if I started using again after such a long time off I would be back on point and in the game again, however I also know it will only be for a little while and then my tolerance would shoot up and it would all turn to shit again and I would be back at square 1 so that isn't an option. Literally I couldn't even imagine if I was an accountant, lawyer or had a corporate job that required me to work at a high performance level 5 days a week, my ass would have been fired by now.

Anyways, sorry for the long post, I just wanted to see if anyone else who maybe runs a business or works in other professional services or in the corporate world has struggled or dealt with anything like this after getting off opioids, and if so, if they had any advice, there was anything they did or maybe supplemented with that helped? Or is it just more time... I don't know, I guess it just feels like I used opioids as a tool/crutch for so long I'm just not the same savvy business owner now that I am off them. Maybe I am just a weird case. Thanks in advance for any feedback.

PS: Although I don't touch opioids, Kratom, subs or anything of the sort, I do use Adderall a few times a week, drink a little, smoke/eat pot a few times a week at night, an occasional benzo, so I guess I do wonder if that could be affecting part of my brain healing correctly. Nothing habitual, I just didn't go the ""fully sober"" route yet at least. Although as most people I'm guessing who's DOC was opioids, everything else is just a sorry substitute on occasion that is better than nothing but still makes me feel like I have a bit of the addict mentality still in a way so I am considering trying the fully sober route for a bit possibly.",2

I've tried a couple times to come off of my pain meds (hydromorphone) for awhile now and have relapsed each time. Well this time around I want to succeed... and then come off the benzos when I'm clean from the pain meds.
 I have enough of my prescription left to take a low dose for the next 6 days and then I'm out. Usually around this time I'm in a panic as I've downed all my meds a week before I can get my next fix. But I can't live like that. I've done it too many times and I just can't keep going through this... 
I gave the rest of my meds to my husband to hide on me and to give only one a day. I've been trying to be open with him about it and it's hard. He's been very supportive though. Reason I'm taking one pill a day is so that my withdrawals wont put me in the hospital (I am quite sick so any kind of stress on my body has a big impact on my health). 
One benzo, one opiate in the evening near bedtime. I feel as if this is a good first step. But I'm already having withdrawals and cravings. And I want to fight them. I want to succeed. 
Any advice? Sorry if this is all confusing to read I tried to type it out as best I could. Thanks for reading.",2

I've split up my remaining stuff into decreasing portions. I've got a timed lockbox. Each day I'll remove the previous day's dosage, minus 0.01g, then set the timer for 24 hours. So far I've managed to cut back at least 50%.

The issue I'm having is that I didn't pick up enough supply to get me the other 50% of the way. I acquired more last night but its potency is ridiculous. I'm quite certain it's mixed with some sort of sedative or etizolam (happens quite often up here). I was also ripped off quite badly at about 50% weight.

My question is, how can I properly 'buff' this so it can get up to the proper weight? I think if I do that, it'll reduce its strength to an appropriate level for my taper and also give me enough weight to last until the taper is complete. I went to a local bulk foods store and bought all their white powders (lol) and, by vaping them all, was able to discern a couple that are used as cutting agents... now I'm just not sure what to do with them. 

Any help would be much appreciated as this has really messed up my taper. While I'd managed to reduce my use to about a single point (0.1g) per day, consuming the equivalent amount of this new stuff is enough to render me unconscious for like two days and throw my tolerance out of whack again. I really wish people would stop selling garbage like this.",3

I have struggled on and off with opioid abuse for almost four years now. I had recently managed to stay clean for about 6 months and I've been doing pretty well in my second year of university.

Near the end of my first semester, my back started to really bother me again. I'm a pretty tall guy and I have dealt with back pain for many years now but it seemed to just be getting worse. Of course I booked an appointment with my campus physio, but my addict brain needed that instant relief so I went ahead and ordered some kratom online. It did help with my back, but more importantly, it felt *really great*. I spent the next month chugging green sludge multiple times per day, consuming an ungodly amount of grapefruit juice in the process. I had convinced myself that this was an excellent long-term solution.

Of course the euphoria left me wanting more. By the Christmas break, I couldn't help but think about heroin. I had nearly a month to myself, which I figured was plenty of time for me to binge and recover before my second semester began. Once I flew home, I chucked my bag of kratom and did exactly that. I've experienced the anguish of withdrawal many times, but at this point my fiend mindset had no consideration for what I would be putting my future self through.

I ran out of heroin five days ago and have been suffering cold turkey since. I may not have used for as long as some other people on this sub but a couple weeks for me is enough to put me through hell afterwards. I'm angry at myself for allowing this to happen again.

I understand kratom is helpful for withdrawls but if you don't need it for that then please don't buy it. As in my case it could trigger a full relapse.",78

I am posting here looking for help from heroin users who have managed to get their lives back on track.

My son has been using on and off for about 5 years. He has had short periods when life has been calm and he has been clean. The last few years though through Covid have been tough, my son lost his job at the start of the pandemic, and came back to live in a flat near me, and then when he lost that he came back to the attic room in my house.

At first he was reducing and then getting off H but about a year ago relapsed. I intended to impose boundaries around this, but he assured me that if I left him to it, he would get himself back on track. That didn't happen and as far as I can see he is no further forward than he was a year ago. He lives in a mess of a room, hardly ever baths or washes his clothes. He contributes nothing financially because all of his welfare cash goes on heroin.

He is desperate to relocate to an area of the country where he attended college and had a good group of friends (not users). Stupidly, I agreed that I would go with him and help him to get setup there, and stay around for 12 months while he gets back on his feet. He has promised that if I do this he will be able to kick heroin because he will have a life back again. Since then I have spoken to people that work with addicts and they have advised that he gets himself stable before thinking about doing this. I do appreciate though that where we live at the moment he has no friends and history and there is minimal support for users.  Although when he has had the opportunity he has never attended NA meetings more than a handful of time, or kept counselling appointments.  

I guess my question is, is it enough to get back in a relatively good environment? The things that I can see going wrong are these:

1. His old friends have moved on in their lives and don't want to hang-out anymore, they have jobs and relationships. My son, having sat in a bedroom using heroin for so long has made him a very different person. If my son moves while he is so vulnerable he may see himself through their eyes and find that hard to deal with. If he did stick to his word and got off H soon after moving, will he really want to socialize or do much of anything for a while.
2. This is going to be very expensive and also will threaten my job as I will have to work from home while I am with him or get another job, that is something that fills me with dread, as moving somewhere new, trying to support my son through this and then starting a new job all feels like a bit of a leap.
3. I would rather spend the cash on rehab when he is ready to take that step. He has made the point that there will be more of an NA community in a bigger city, which is correct and may help.

Please, if you have direct experience of getting clean, please help me with this. I just don't want to let him down.

Thank you for getting to the end of this, sorry its so long.",6

every time i try to kick <even with suboxone> the withdrawals (especially the insomnia and nightmares! omg the nightmares) are so bad that i go back to the pills. how do i stop this cycle? being sick is the only thing preventing me from quitting.

for some reason my wds last for EXTREMELY long periods of time. like a year and a half ago i remember i quit for around a month but that month was the worst month of my life. day 30 and i still was unable to sleep even on seroquel and xanax. i had a general dysphoria that made every day seem like hell.. the way my body felt is indescribable. nothing brought me pleasure and i felt so detached from reality. i was sooo anxious.

i thought i was going through psychosis and at one point even checked myself into the ER because i thought there was something wrong with me. but the docs said i was fine. i was so suicidal during this month that i bought myself a gun. my weight during this time dropped from 125> 91lbs. (im a 5‚Äô3 19yo female)

so yeah. that was the last time i tried to get sober.

what the hell is wrong with me?? why do i only feel ok when i am on opiates?

Not necessarily wanting to get involved with changing their life, or forcing them to address their addiction, but more a sense of wanting to show them there is a better way without pushing that way onto them. 

I guess my thinking is if they see that someone like me can change their life around, and actually become a better person, then it‚Äôs possible for anyone, no matter how far gone they think they are. 

I was a total piece of shit when I was a junky, and I‚Äôve spent the last decade rebuilding who I was as a person and building that on top of a foundation of honesty in the present and candor of my past. 

I was lucky enough to survive my addiction, let alone be given a second chance to start fresh, granted there were a lot of burnt bridges and only a few able to be repaired over time, but I have so much in much life now because of that second that chance, and at the core of that second chance was forgiveness. 

It has taken me years to forgive myself, and I guess my whole rationale is that by showing someone else that forgiveness, even when their not ready for it, that it could help kickstart the process for them. At the very least, they‚Äôll know someone is there for them when they‚Äôre ready. 

I was a junky long enough to know not to give more than I‚Äôm willing to part with, and that it‚Äôs very easy for someone to become dependent on another person for their sobriety. So there is definitely a clear line I don‚Äôt want to cross, but I feel like every addict, no matter their drug of choice, just wants someone to see them and recognize their experience. 

At the end of February I‚Äôll be going on 12 years clean from opiates and oxi addiction. Technically it was a few weeks after that when I made the actual decision. At that time I didn‚Äôt get clean on purpose, I tried to give up on life. Spent the next two weeks in a mental hospital, right up until a few days before my 25th birthday, that‚Äôs when I knew I had to get clean and change my life from the ground up. My addiction cost me everything I thought that mattered at the time, and it took me almost another 5 years just to learn it didn‚Äôt really matter at all. 

My point is, I was ready to give up, but the universe/Buddha/god/Allah/Krishna, or whatever you believe, it gave me another chance, and today I have a 6 year old daughter who wouldn‚Äôt have been here otherwise. 

I was able to rebuild a life of substance for myself, and I have so much more than I could have ever said I deserved, at the very minimum I just want to be able to give hope to someone who doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible. 

This has been a gnawing sensation for the last few years, I‚Äôm just now able to put words to it though. So I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else, who has a good amount of time clean under their belt and been able to change their lives, feels that way as well??",6

We havnt been together for about a year and a half now, and I've been sober for a year and a half now.

I've been so fucking depressed since I've gotten those news, stopped eating regularly, my sleep schedule is all types of fucked up and I started having to deal with cravings again (havnt slipped up yet, still strong ü§ô)

Everytime I think about her, instantly my brain gets overloaded with memories of all the dirty, disgusting shit she put me through during our relationship that I brushed off and forgot about because I was in so deep with fentanyl I didn't care, and now that I'm sober, I'm able to remember some of these memories. 

My thing is... I want to be sad and cry,  I really REALLY do because this is the only girl I've been in love with and she's saved my life ATLEAST 2 times from when I overdosed... I remember even after I would overdose and be taken to the hospital, she would follow the ambulance and we would just get high in the hospitals washroom.. good memories.

I really wish I could have helped her get clean, we've tried many to do it together, but if I'm gonna keep it a buck , I had to leave her in the dust because I kept finding myself relapsing whenever we would cross paths. 

I honestly just simply don't know how to feel.
Obviously I'm feeling depressed because shits been fucked since I've heard the news, but I can't shed a single fucking tear for this girl?? 
She always told me she can't get sober unless I'm by her side(which I'm not sure if that was genuine, or mind games) 
I do know for a fact, if I was still with her, there's a good chance I would have overdosed and died( I was super prone to overdosing, didn't know when enough was enough)

My minds really jumbled right now as it's been a while since I've last slept and im having a difficult time putting my thoughts into words.",8

I got an appointment with bicycle health and they recommended a micro induction method to get from fent and on to subs. This is the plan my provider made for me

Day 1 .25mg subs 2xday
Day 2 .5mg subs 2xday
Day 3 1mg sub 2xday
Day 4 2mg sub 2xday
Day 5 3mg sub 2xday
Day 6 4mg sub 2xday
Day 7 12 mg sub once in morning and stop all other opiate use

I started last night with the .25mg and used a pill or 2 after was perfectly fine this morning i took another .25mg and like a pill and a half and was fine. Tonight I jump to .5mg sub 

I‚Äôll be documenting my experience here, please leave your comments about your experience below. I am a little concerned about the last day when you jump off opiate use. I read that as you increase your sub dose you decrease your other opiate use, does this give you guys pwd?

It should however have absolutely turned up yesterday at the latest and if it had of then I would have without doubt used just to get some relief. I‚Äôm now free of all WD symptoms and actually feeling nice just from smoking weed and it appears the vendor I ordered from has done some kind of selective Christmas scam as his recent reviews are shite ü•¥

I believe a higher power has looked out for me there because I was slipping, and fast. I don‚Äôt even have any trauma I don‚Äôt think? I just love getting high, the sweet euphoria and confidence I get from oxy is just superior to any other feeling. I feel like that‚Äôs my true self lol and I‚Äôm suppressing my potential by not getting high. 

I will 100% no doubt use oxy again in the future, I‚Äôve never really had a reliable vendor or plug to get it from regularly which has saved me from a bad addiction. I usually get it for a month or two then get screwed so never trust them again and it takes me months to find a new reliable vendor. This was the first time I had withdrawal symptoms that kept me in bed and unable to carry on with daily life so I definitely understand the dangers of fucking with them for too long now. The best thing about it is no other opiate touches the spot for me so when I can‚Äôt get my oxy I don‚Äôt use blues for example because none of them seem to give that energy and euphoria like oxy does.

So obviously it‚Äôs a bit of an L losing money on the DNMs (it was a FE listing because trusted vendor) but it‚Äôs also a blessing that I‚Äôm now likely to go on another significant tolerance break. Interested to see what you guys think about the energy effect of oxy and if you can think of anything that compares to it in the opiate family. I‚Äôve heard Kratom can be quite stimulating in low doses but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never tried, always assumed it would be too weak. TIA",1

Slow down and take it one day at a time.

This is my story.","A bit of back story before i start my ramble; 


Look through my post history and you will find i had a stash of a lot of different pills, which are my main devil. Benzos, Oxy, Morphine ect ect, i had it. Ive always loved pills. The taste, the feels, the looks. The ordering, the waiting on them. Everything. I was/am completely hooked. I cannot shake this shit.


And yet, up until 2 weeks ago, i had 2 months clean. i had a bad trip and felt very weird on day on a mix of Xanax, Oxy and Soma. After that day, i swore i was done. And i did 2 months clean, cold turkey. Fucking hell.


But, as we approached the 2 month mark, i felt the urge, the need, the desire to use again, sneaking up on me. I still had my big stash, i just did not touch it. One day, i had a massive headache and had gotten some Diazepam and muscle relaxers from my doctor, to help the pain, as it is tension based. I walked around the house with the pills in my hands saying: I KNOW, this is a bad, bad, bad idea. But its the only thing that will help. I KNOW not to and to stick it out. I broke down, took the pills and instantly i knew something had changed. That feeling of ""I can overcome this, i've kept my distance to the pills for SO long, i can keep it going"" - that disapered and was replaced with a ""Well. I already slipped up, fuck it, might as well keep going and try the new pills i never got to try before going sober"". So the next day it was business as usual. Pop some valiums, some Xanax. Some Oxy for the headaches. Whatever small reason i had, i had a pill to take for it. And i did. 



Rewinding a bit, some time ago during the summer i found out about Tapentadol. 100mg is like 20mg Oxy, i have read. A drug like a mix between Tramadol and Morphine. And Tramadol was my favorite since i was a teen. So i bought some. 
They came, and oh my. What a lovely combo, for me. Loved it. 
Then i discovered a drug called Soma-Dol-T. A mix of SOMA and tapentadol/oxy. Made in India somewhere. I told myself it was fine and safe, but you know. You never really know. 



I started using those and they worked wonders. Removed my pain and made me nod the fuck out. I kept using all of my other drugs, as you can see in my stash pictures. A mix of everything, i used. Because i wanted to.
My wife frequently came home and found me nodded out, not responding and wasn't present. She told me she couldn't handle seeing me like this, like the old addicted me previous years ago. We've been together 16 years, she's seen a lot of my addiction and how it takes hold. She would get me to bed and let me sleep it off, being pissed and sad for me the next day. And i would continue to do it. Thats addiction for you. 



Now, lets get to the case. This monday, this week, i was sitting at my pc, chilling and waiting for the Soma-dol-t to take effect. Being impatient, i took two more. Then i blacked out, or nodded the fuck of if you want. The next thing i remember is me, laying in my couch, with my wife screaming at me, crying. She had been trying to get in contact with me for the last 10-15min and nothing worked, i would not wake up. So, she did what she felt was her only option and dialed the ambulance. The came, saw me passed the fuck out and i don't remember much. They tried getting me to wake, using some antidote for overdosing on various drugs, and did all types of shit on me. I remember fuck all. What i DO remember though, is hearing them telling my wife they needed to get to the hospital, fast. They put on sirens and away they went. Now, apparently while being nodded out, i had stopped breathing. Apparently that happens on overdoses on Oxy, plus the muscle relaxers combo did not help. (And so, if my wife was home an hour later, she might have found me dead. That fucks with my mind so much.)



So, every time they didn't yell my name or shake my body, i would stop to breathe. Now, that is some scary shit to be told, after you're out on the other side. They got me to the hospital, hooked me up to several machines and whatnot, i was barely awake at this point so i don't remember. But i remember them rushing in the room every time the machine would beep loudly. That was, apparently every time i stopped breathing. Which was a lot. That kept going on all through the night, until i was finally stable on my own and i woke up the next morning, confused, hurt, sad, overwhelmed. They released me that afternoon and i came home to a very hurt, scared and sad wife. I went downstairs, took everything out of my stash, gave it to her and said: Im done. And i am. This really shook me to my core. I look at life differently now. I want to live. I want to be alive. Got no kids, but i want to one day. And they need for me to be clean and sober. 



I have some friends who has a two year old boy, the sweetest thing in the entire world. I adore him, love him to death and he's not even mine! Yesterday was the first day i saw him, since leaving the hospital and when i did i just hugged him tight and cried. The thought about me having left him wondering ""When is Blauwy coming to play with me and my racing cars again?"" And they would have to tell him, that, that wouldn't happen. It just broke me. Breaks me just writing it out.



So that's it, that's my experience. I overdosed, came back and now i'm fighting for a clean life and existence. I'm taking it one day of the time, for now, the withdrawals are my biggest hurdle and that's gonna suck some donkey balls. 



Thank you, if you made it this far. Pouring your heart out can really fill some empty space. Thank you. I hope every one of you made it into the new year safely.",38
