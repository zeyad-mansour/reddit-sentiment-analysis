I have a comfortable amount of money saved. I don't know what to do with it most of the time but my car is fucked and I can pay for it. I don't miss bill payments. I don't randomly call out for work. I talk to my family and real friends on a regular basis. I feel alienated when I'm at the clinic and there's people that act and speak like the people I used to associate with. It feels strange and surreal to think of a time where I related to them- not in a judgemental way, it just kind of shows me how much of me passions I really gave up on to the point where I could only surround myself with others that had ""drugs"" as a personality. It's a good feeling.

I look successful. I can basically fool everyone around me that I am and always have been oblivious to the underground life I used to live- dodging cops, coughing up cash for a phone number, living in discomfort and sweat on a daily basis as my habit constantly grew above and beyond my pay grade (as it does for everyone). I still have some weird points where people talk to me and I don't know what to say because I still can't relate. I know you guys will understand what I mean.

I feel like I have successfully tricked people into giving me a job and a paycheck that I do not deserve. Does that feeling ever go away? Just feeling like you fucked up your life and the lives of others so badly that nothing feels like you have actually earned any of it? Anthony bourdain had a quote that really sums up my feelings and has stuck with me since I first read it.

 >“I should’ve died in my 20s. I became successful in my 40s. I became a dad in my 50s. I feel like I’ve stolen a car — a really nice car — and I keep looking in the rear-view mirror for flashing lights. But there’s been nothing yet.”

Hope you're all doing well.

The bad kind, where you're in withdrawal and when you're finally about to use you wake up. I'd compare it to when I was going through withdrawal while using and I'd get so exhausted my body would let me sleep for 5 or 10 minutes and I'd have a dream I got shit and wake up. It's like that, except ridiculously longer while I'm asleep for 7-9 hours. 

I've always had very vivid dreams and remembered all of my dreams. I have lucid dreams once or twice a month without trying. But this is killing me. It's been the past 8 nights in a row now. And I'd say probably more than half the nights for the last couple months. 

I've haven't even experienced withdrawal that intense in like 8 years. Obviously, I have no desire to relive it. It feels so real and I can remember exactly how it felt for all the hours I was dreaming. I've had less intense, sporadic user dreams and I can handle that. But this is making me feel like I'm losing my mind. 

I'm waking up drenched in sweat, heart racing, painfully tense, skin crawling, catching my breath and running to the bathroom every morning. And I'm having a harder and harder time managing it. I'm feeling like shit all day, despite being active and healthy. I've stopped eating most of the time because everything sounds disgusting and my stomach is in giant knots. I've been keeping up with exercise, but it gets physically more painful with zero payoff. 

I am at a point where I'm dying to go to sleep and actually rest. I'm afraid to go to sleep but entirely exhausted from the minute I wake up. I have the same dreams if I nap.

Before I explain my story I would just like to say I know very little about opiates and I am a heavy benzodiazepine user, but do not know much about opiates.


Recently my friend passed away and was found on the floor in his room dead.  He was at the beach Sunday and consumed possible 4mg xanax, a little bit of cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol.He was messaging me throughout the day, and seemed to be having a great time.  He was dropped off home at about 6:30-7:00PM.  I know that he had in his possession two Blue M30 Pills.  I know that he did not know if they were real or pressed.  We weren't sure of it..I have a theory that he crushed and snorted the pills and overdosed..when the body was found there was a very high amount of blood that came out of his mouth.  Is having a seizure possible from over dosing?  Why would there be so much blood? These are some of the questions I am looking for.  His sisters believe he had a seizure but were blind about his opiate possessions until I informed them..  is it possible he snorted these pills or pill and had a seizure?  The coroner put the time of death at Monday around 12:30AM.  I also believe he took more xanax pills after he was dropped off home Sunday at around 630-7PM. Maybe 4mgs?  We were heavy xanax abusers with high tolerances..

He was also prescribed gabapentin after being in the hospital in december in December from having a seizure from Xanax withdrawals.

I am just looking for some help to get some answers here because I do not believe he could have just had a seizure naturally just like that..I believe he OD'd off of the Opiates but like I said I am not very well informed off opiates and symptoms of overdose or if seizures are possible from it.",2

Energy is slowing coming back, but brain fog still weighs quite heavy. Music and walking my dog have been the formula for success. Just getting out into nature and listening to music is a godsend. It is during those moments that I build hope and calming feeling that it will be okay again, possibly better. You will find your love for music again. 

Lingering side effects: Still have mud butt and mornings continue to feel weird. but after about an hour,  it seems to get better; hard to explain. Armpit sweat persist which is annoying. 

Timeline: 
Day 1-15: absolute hell. No way around it. It’s going to suck. 
Day 15-30: more hell and literally you’re bump on a log..... just mush. 
Day 45: turning point where you can actually see light at end of tunnel. 
Day 55: feel like a human again. 
Day 60: about 85% still have some side effects aforementioned above.

I hope this post is okay here, I wasnt sure where else it'd be appropriate.  I'll try to be brief.

About an hour ago I found out an old friend of mine overdosed on heroin last night and passed away. I'm heartbroken from the news.  It just hurts so badly.  He was such a gentle and sensitive soul. 😪

I haven't actually seen him since March of 2019.  I have been clean and sober since March 12th of last year.  For me, part of getting clean and actually staying clean this time involved largely cutting ties with everyone that was in any way a threat to my sobriety.  This included everyone I used to get high with and he was on that list.  

I would still check in occasionally on messenger, mostly with words of encouragement, letting him know that I cared about him and believed in him and wanted to see him clean and happy one day.

But now that won't ever happen. 💔

This isn't the first friend I've lost to addiction but it is still always a shock and ever so painful.

I found myself going through some of our old conversations and I was not prepared for the strong, complex emotions it brought up.  Or the way it would trigger me.  The conversations brought back vivid memories of the time we lived together with some other people in what was essentially a trap house.  I then found myself profoundly missing those times.

Which is insane.

It's hard for me to articulate this but sometimes I'm still caught off guard by how confusing and seemingly illogical my emotions can be and this time they were powerful emotions all intertwined with grief.  I know, beyond a doubt, that my time living there and for a short period after that were the worst, most chaotic times in my life.  I remember hating myself and wanting to end it all many times.  It was a constant cycle of trying to scheme a way to more money so I could stave off being sick for a little longer.  I was a slave and hopeless inside.  It was such a dark time.  I'll be continuing to pick up the pieces from that period of time for years to come.

And yet, at the same time, I missed it tremendously in ways I don't even understand.  Maybe it's that I was never alone then?  There were always people around me.  Even though I know all those people were just fellow users and it was all tangled up with our addictions.  It's difficult for me to pinpoint the reasons for my acute sense of longing for that era.  Maybe I just miss my old friends despite everything else.

Some of them were there for me during times when there was no one else there.  Desperate times.  I still miss them and love them, despite everything, even though I know none of them can be part of my life as long as they are in the midst of their active addictions.

I guess the short story is that, as you all know, recovery is a challenging path and can often be fraught with powerful emotions and urges that are so obviously counterproductive and illogical and yet overwhelming nonetheless.

I am going to miss my friend forever and it breaks my heart that I will never see him again and that he will never join me in recovery. 😪😪😪💔💔💔

I hope and pray that this is the last friend I ever lose to addiction.  

Thanks for reading this to any who do.  Recovery is possible.  Addiction is self-hatred and hoplessness.  Recovery is hope and love.  I believe in you.

TL;DR:  I'm 14 months into recovery and tonight I found out an old friend I used to use with passed away from an overdose last night and it brought up a lot of powerful and complex emotions for me.",38

I’m looking to taper with suboxone but I do not know where to get it. I have had the strips before and was able to do a fast taper with them, where I was clean after a week. The problem was with me going back to pills. I want to do this again.

What I understand is that there is a new law regarding covid-19 where they are easier to get a script, with just a phone call maybe? 

So my questions are: who do I call? How much money do I need? Should I be worried about getting insurance involved? Will insurance notify my work, doctors or in any way effect me?

I apologize if I broke any rules. (Let me know and I will edit) I’m just looking to change my life and this way has helped me before. Thanks",2

Streaming eyes...	check.
Yawning constantly.... check.
Random arm or leg spasms... check.

Lethargy... check.

Mild stomach issues
Everthing comes in waves that last an hour or so then fade into something else. Yesterday I was so exhausted but the day before I managed to move around and feel pretty good then today I feel like I am clean. My eyes are clear no bloodshot or eye yellowing and my pupils are dilated.
STILL have a long road ahead of me but in 11 years I don't have any opiates in my system.
Im so fucking proud of myself I didn't do it only for me this time I done it for my two little boys who deserve the best I can can be and I just couldn't do that with the way I was.
I don't ever want to put myself in this horrible situation ever again. I have a good life.... Somehow..... All down to my wife really she's without a doubt the strongest person I've ever known, all the crap she put up with and 20 years 2 kids and later she's still with me and looking forward to an even better 20 years ahead.

Short backstory on my addiction.
Got super depressed and suicidal anti depressants done nothing started taking codeine that helped then it didn't. From there it was pure dihyrocodeine then morphine sulphate then oxycontin max daily use was about 750mg. That was over 5 years then went to maintenance and been on bupe the remainder started at 10 and reduced over a year to 0.8mg.

If one thing I've learned from all this (other than not taking pain killers unsupervised) is that every detox is different I've had some horrible difficult withdrawals and that was even coming from 1mg bupe. But as long as you try you never truly know what this one's going to be like. 
So keep trying one day it will happen and it will be the best thing you did. 

Stay safe and look after yourself and the ones you love.",33

First off, it’s wonderful to see such a supportive community. You all are great. It’s the reason I’m comfortable saying I’m addicted to Oxycodone and I want to stop.  

1. What’s the best way to quit Oxy? And how do you sleep during withdrawal?

I’m looking for advice on how to go about stopping my ~300mg Oxy per week addiction.  My goal is to not be dependent on Oxy by July 1, when my gf moves in with me.  What’s the best method to do this?  I’ve seen all sorts of stories on here, from tapering, to cold turkey, to detox programs, etc.  I’m leaning towards trying a taper, but I’d like to be symptom-free by July, so I’m not sure that timeline would work.  

Also, when I go 3 days without Oxy, I can’t sleep, even though I’m super tired.  I’ve tried everything: Ambien, herbs, “resetting”, meditation, Benadryl, melatonin, etc.  Is there anything that works?

2. My Situation:

- 1.5 years ago, I was single, had a new job in a new city, but no friends and was super bored on weekends.  So, I found a way to get some oxycodone, which I’d had before due to medical surgeries.  
- I slowly worked up to ~100mg of oxy per day on Saturday and Sunday, and then ~100 on Wednesday or Thursday as well.  (50mg per dose now, 2 doses each day i do it.) I typically go 1-2 days off between sessions.
- At first, I could go a week or so without it and feel fine, but now, after 3 days without any oxy, I can’t sleep AT ALL. I’m super tired but I just can’t sleep.  So frustrating.  I also have diarrhea and just generally feel unmotivated and lethargic.
- Also, I was able to meet a girl, and she is moving in with me in July. I’d like to be off of Oxy by then.

Recently though I have been waking up a LOT more than usual throughout the night. I'm thinking it's my body saying ""Hey, you don't need that much sleep anymore!!""

I was feeling pretty good from getting a lot done and scratching some things off my list, but the demons inside me kept creeping up on me...

Suddenly I found myself lying on the bed with only the thought of relapse on mind.  ""You know, just one pill just this once"" type of thoughts even though that same exact trick caused me to lapse last Friday. 

Laying in bed I thought to that day and how even with that lapse of weakness, I've still barely used this month, but because of that I still was not and am not free.  I still haven't gone over three weeks without my DOC.  I still know what my loved ones are thinking when they ask me how I'm doing since the hospital.  With my generic, but seemingly optimistic, response of ""Things are looking up!"" Or ""Doing better every day""  These half truths continue to be my vice.  I'm still addicted and always will be however there is a positive to all of this.  I'll always be getting closer to the truth as long as I never stop trying to quit. 

At that moment I forced myself to get out of my head and do something good in the moment. Instead of going to score I decided to go for a run instead. And even though this was a small victory, who knows?  That run might have saved my life.

90 days off fentanyl today - I should be excited about it but only my girlfriend and brothers actually believe I'm opiate-free. My family doesn't think I'm off and although it shouldn't bother me, it does. It took a lot to be open with my parents about my struggles with opiates. It means so much that they love me, but I regret sharing it with them because now I feel as if all they'll ever see me as is an addict. I feel like they can't accept me for who I am since I've gotten off of fentanyl. I feel like they will never be able to accept me because they don't want to think of me as anything except a drug addict, instead of a person who has gone through struggles in life and is actively working on changing. It hurts so much, as I have been trying so hard to get better - and lately when I share my struggles and my improvements with them they tell me that I am simply trying to manipulate them that my life is better so that I can keep on using drugs. My parents promise me that they will know when I am truly sober, so whenever I call them and they think I'm high they change their tone and it feels like they're patronizing me. It feels so invalidating when I put effort in to be sober and obviously am open about struggling.

My mom thinks I wouldn't be hurt now about being called out for being high unless I was getting high and feeling guilty about it. But given how hard I've worked to be open with them about getting off opiates and all - I feel justified in being upset and wanting them to want to treat me normal (for that matter, I would want to be treated the same even if I was high!).

Here is a timeline of my progression and my struggles with mental illness/addiction:

1. Last Feb I posted on here about my boss dying, or my ""changing moment"". After eight months of struggling with fentanyl, and four months of my family knowing, my boss dies from the same pills that I was using. I was not only horrified for my own safety, but deeply upset about not reaching out to him despite knowing he was also having similar issues. This event really scarred me and, to be honest, I still am processing what happened. Needless to say, I went to an addiction specialist doc the day after the funeral and start cold turkey off fentanyl. Everyone on reddit basically laughed me off and said, ""ok dude your boss dying isn't gonna just make you stop the most addictive drug in the world"". Yet, l did. I started gabapentin and clonidine, and with the help of weekly therapy and plenty of support from friends/family/reddit I completely stopped all opiate use. Two weeks into cold turkey, I realize if I stay at my workplace that I'll continue using at some point so I decide to dissociate. I put in two weeks notice and quit. I come home anticipating to start a new job and move, but then COVID shuts me down on quarantine. Horribly depressed, I start drinking and smoking more everyday. I didn't know what to do with my time, and I can't describe the pain of fentanyl withdrawal. It wasn't the cravings as I had a no-tolerance mindset for opiates, rather, it was the depression that tore me apart. From the end of Feb to April, I couldn't find motivation for anything in my life. Nothing but apathy and pain that I've never had before. Every morning I woke up cold, dressed in multiple pairs of clothes to negate the goosebumps that would ensue. Every shower was an opportunity to sob alone, and sometimes that meant over things that I shouldn't have felt guilty about, but couldn't help it. Life was a living hell that I had set myself up for.
2. This May starts and pretty much my whole family now is aware of the whole process of hating my life-after-fentanyl and having zero motivation. My attitude had been atrocious, the house my gf and I rent hasn't been cleaned in months and so I convinced myself to see a psychiatrist. I tell my parents this, and they seem okay with it because they see how bad I am struggling whilst sober. I see my new psych, describe my situation and tell him about my history with all types of meds. He confirms depression/ADD and we try to do the weed /alcohol abuse by treating with Naltrexone, Lexapro and Mydayis, along with Klonopin while I get used to the mix. I tell my parents of the first two, but I am dead scared and would never tell them of the last two because I know what they think of treating with those types of drug classes. Placebo or not, on day one I feel great. Some days are harder than others, but holy cow - I'm no longer breaking down for no reason and I no longer am apathetic all day. I start cleaning the house for the first time, I've started working out, and finally start reaching out to unemployment and looking for new jobs. Everyday I make an effort to talk to new people, trying to learn Spanish more again, and most of all, I was calling my mom daily. I still am feeling better everyday, and over the last few weeks I got off the Alcohol/Naltrexone/Klonopin and now doing well on just my depression/ADHD mix, but I still can't seem to kick just one bowl of weed a night (albeit small, it's still something and my next goal to tackle).
3. This is great and all, but yesterday I found out my mom told everyone in my family that she thinks I've been high all along and that I never got off the fentanyl. I tell her this is ridiculous, but she is dead set that I wouldn't be contacting everyone about feeling not depressed all of the sudden unless I got back on opiates and were trying to manipulate everyone. I ask her if I can get a blood test done or anything, but she says I can just go about using again if I do that - and that the only way she'll be happy is if I go to rehab and post on facebook that I have an addiction issue so ""everyone can be aware"". I don't want to do this as I've worked so hard to get where I'm at, and I'm finally feeling normal again without opiates. There is nothing I can do to make her believe me, and I know it shouldn't be important to me, but having a relationship with them is something that I don't know why I care so deeply about. I had a conversation with my girlfriend about this today and she says that I need to stop talking to my parents about this entirely because they are never going to understand my situation simply because we disagree about both recreational and medical drug use. She thinks that no matter what, they'll just try to get me to change something else about myself and that it's a reflection of having me at such an early age/always wanting better for your kid.

What do you think guys? Am I self-deluding myself by going to get mental treatment now? No matter what I keep telling myself I just need to be grateful that I'm not where I was three months ago. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",6

It first started when they lost a severe amount of weight in like six months, they're 5""8 but they weigh 5st. They were about 12st before this all happened. 

They tried to tell us it was caused by Crohn's disease, but they've been found by friends passed out in the street and covered in vomit, dazed and speaking very slowly and also never suffered from the disease before. 

They drink a lot of energy drinks, I remember hearing that an increase of sugar intake was related to some drug but I don't remember what - I don't know much about drugs, which is why I'm here. 

They lost all of their teeth, too. We tried asking a doctor but he wouldn't say anything about it because he doesn't know enough about the person to comment - I understand that they have a professional code, even if it really annoyed me. Do you know what they could be using?

I've heard from a local police officer and close friend that they may also be selling drugs. They're being watched by the police because of it. We *know* they're on drugs, we don't know what but it's very obvious - they've stole from us and lied about it, they lie about everything and try to swindle money from us, they've attacked us multiple times and they even tried committing insurance fraud in my father's name. 

We're kind of at the end of our rope, and we don't know what to do. We've tried so many times, offered to pay for rehab and even tried bribing them with a year's rent to get help. How else could we reach out to them?

I don't want to say they're a lost cause, and it sounds terrible but it's becoming too much to deal with it. I have my own problems, and so much of my life is spent looking after this person. I'm feeling very lost and I don't know what to do. Please help.",2

I jumped from subs eight days ago. I had tapered down from 8mg over the course of pretty much a year minus some months. Yesterday I slipped and took a small amount. 

I realized that if I had it in the house, I would take it. So I gathered all the remaining strips I could find and gave them to my mom. 

This morning is confirmation that my addict mind never intended to quit. Which is insane because I have been tapering for literally almost a year. 

I realized this morning that last night I gave away the only thing that has been getting me out of bed just to be NORMAL for the past year.

I had no idea my addiction would be so ANGRY with me this morning. Thoughts like “How could you do that” and “”now what are you going to do? You’re finished. Say goodbye to life as you know it.”

I feel like I’m free falling. My body is screaming and reaching out in every direction, demanding satiation.

I got a taste of the depression and the lifeless, colorless world of life without being on subs, and that was powerful enough for me to take a small dose even though I had worked all week to be free and make it thru the kick. 

I’ve been tapering and trying to get to zero for over a year. And now I’m there and I’m like, “YOU GAVE YOUR SUBS AWAY?? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?? Now what will you use to come down from kratom!?”

How insane is that?? Subs to come down from kratom. It’s like I never wanted to be sober in the first place. But I know I did/do because I worked my ass off to accomplish this..: I went through countless days of pain and misery and aching and waiting....

This is the only place I know to go to right now. 

The memory of WHY I wanted to be free of subs, all the icky mornings and waiting games, is gone and has been replaced with an addiction demon screaming at me right in my face.

Because I know what’s coming. I got a small taste of it and now that’s going to be my world. I can’t even use kratom because THATS how I got on subs in the first place! But that’s where my mind is going!

I am literally MOURNING that bag of subs I gave to my parents to “hold onto”. I’m sure I’ll never see it again unless I make up some insidious lie or to rampaging through their closets or god knows what...

I am literally falling with no parachute. And I’m not stupid, I’ve read all the posts and reports. My life and happiness feels like it’s over. The color is slowly bleeding out of my world from my
Small dose yesterday and what is now a world in sepia will soon be a world in black and white, and then some. 

I am in such despair that I feel this way. Why am I not HAPPY I reached my goal?? Why am I not proud of myself?? 

I gave away the bag of stuff that has made me likeable, sociable, etc... but I know that’s a lie because I was all those things BEFORE I was on subs. But my mind is telling me never again. I know it’s my addiction talking. It’s telling me, “You could just use kratom and then use the subs to do a quick two day detox”.... YES I know that’s insane! That’s the point!

I’ve done what I set out to do and now I’m looking back at the burning cornfields and thinking “What have I done”

I don’t want you to think I’m saying I don’t want to be clean. I’m saying that it’s like I FORGOT I wanted to be clean. It’s not that I want to be on drugs. I just want to enjoy my life, WANT to get out of bed and be able to enjoy the simple things everyone else does. I’ve been chasing sobriety from benzos and what have you for ten years now. 

I was never an opiate user before subs. It was kratom that led me to them. Now I feel like I’m nothing and can’t/don’t know how to live without them and now they are gone. 

Today I feel like I’m mourning. I just really hope I’m not mourning myself.",8

I'm being ever increasingly pressured to stop taking opiates by everyone around me to the point where I feel like I have to to keep my relationships alive. But if I'm honest, the only reason I've ever considered stopping for my own personal reasons is due to money.

I've always had a whole host of mental health problems, including severe depression, anxiety, OCD, BPD... you name it, either I, or someone in my family has it. I've never found it easy to get out of bed, have hobbies, go to school/work or even look after myself. That is, until I found opiates.

Suddenly I had that kick of dopamine I needed to get through my day. My whole world seemed a lot brighter; I could go to lectures, work, shopping. I could get out of bed, look after myself, even have hobbies! For once in my life I felt freed from the chains of my mental state and able to just live and have fun. 

But now I'm trying to quit, I feel like I'm giving up my happiness and stability again. Yeah, it might help with money and relationships, but what's the point if I'm just stuck in bed feeling empty and not wanting to even interact with my partner?

I dunno. I just wanted to rant as I'm not entirely sure what to do. I obviously have to quit some point, but I don't know if I can without wanting to off myself first :/",1

(Bupe.me if anyone’s interested) and they sent my prescription to my Walgreens pharmacy at 4:45pm on Sunday but the pharmacy closes at 5pm I’m Sunday so it wasn’t going to be ready in time. I saw online that the pharmacy showed that it was going to be closed today for Memorial Day and I was worried so I called the pharmacy yesterday so they could move my prescription to a different pharmacy that would be open today. The pharmacy tech who answered yesterday said that they would be open today but holiday hours of 9-5 so that was reassuring. I woke up at 7am this morning, flushed all the H I had left down the toilet and was ready to go to the pharmacy at 9am. I get there and they’re closed. -_- so I called a Walgreens that was open nearby and asked if I could transfer my script there since my pharmacy is closed today. They said no because it’s a controlled substance. So I had flushed all my stuff and was then unable to get suboxone. So then went out and bought more H to last me until tomorrow morning. Just a big giant disappointment that all could have been avoided if the pharmacy tech didn’t decide to spew bullshit without really knowing if they would be open today or not.",3

So I threw away 7 years of sobriety after losing my dad in January of this year, started taking 30 mg Percs (doc) and switched over to the fake Percs (aka pressed m Fentanyl pills). At my worst over the last three months, I was taking 3-4 of them per day, I had managed to taper myself down to 1-1.5 per day up til yesterday. I have been  off for 23 hours now and my withdrawals aren’t super bad, but I am using comfort meds, Kratom, and hydratingALOT! I have a super fast metabolism so I typically start feeling withdrawals within hours of my last dose. Should I expect these wD symptoms to get worse over the next couple days? 

Comfort meds I have:
Xanax
Some stuff for restless legs
Trazadone
Clonidine
Kratom 
Kava
Loperamide ( which there is no way in hell im

I’m supposed to be induced on Tuesday at 345 pm AZ time, but I really don’t want to be on anything let alone suboxone. 

Any thoughts? Advice Thanks in advance!

I’m 37 hours in and doing pretty great, really don’t understand why but I’ll take it. I am supposed to do an induction at 3:45pm today but from the way I feel right now, don’t think I’m gonna do that. My symptoms as of now include: mild chills that

Last night I had horrible insomnia and I broke and took. .25 mg piece of Suboxone this morning. I am fully aware of the kindling effect, like if I took a benzo after going thru wd it would make the wd all come back over again.

Did I just ruin my race? I had comfort med when I was coming off earlier this week. I don’t have those anymore. Can I expect a full resurgence of wd symptoms to rear their head again? 

I know I need to forgive myself but I got further than I have ever gotten before and now I feel like I am back to the beginning even though I know that’s not totally rational. I don’t even know why I still have it in the house!  

Any words of encouragement or wisdom would be so welcome right now. Thank you.... It’s so hard right now in the recovery community because we aren’t able to meet normally",5

Don't even know how to start this without sounding OD self pitying and pathetic. Just been feeling extremely numb with 0 motivation these last few days. Like im content to just fucking exist and waste time until I can go to sleep again. This is so sad Cuz that's not who I am as a person. Idk what to do to get myself out of this rut. At least the last 3 or so days thoughts of doing dope haven't really crossed my mind at all so that's a small victory. But overall I wouldn't even say im like super sad or depressed just completely numb and everything feels meaningless and pointless (which.. fits the definition for being depressed lol). I wish I could be more positive Cuz ofc this type shit ain't conducive to me or to any of y'all reading it its just like me bitching and whining. But I just can't find it in myself to change my attitude.  

Well today im going over to my homegirls house who I haven't seen yet since this all started for a safe masks on hang out. I know we're both super excited and while we realize there's some risk both of our mental health has been so much in the toilet as to justify the benefits of kicking it outweighing the risks. And tomorrow R is coming by to help me w some shit around the house. So it'll be good to see people idk hopefully that'll help.  

This just sucks, idk, everything sucks. I hope, like all times in my life that seemed so horribly awful at the time, I can one day look back on this and be able to have a sense of humor about it. I hope y'all are all doing alright today though and are enjoying the long weekend 💜",9

It just kinda happened because my package is stuck in Chicago. I have been taking them with doses up to 900+ mg all these years and this is the 2nd time I have ever been without. 1st time was horrible and was also by accident. I couldn’t barely walk because I was so dizzy and crying constantly and I didn’t even think about stopping there, it wasn’t until this time that I have some sort of want to never feel this way again. I have had seizures in front of my kids that has left a lasting impact on them due to my addiction. I’m not big on anything but Tramadol. I would rather go without than to go look for something at this point. My doctor had given me a ssri antidepressant 20mg that I lied and said I was taking (because you can’t take both) so I started on those a few days after my last tramadol and have used flexeril but I still can’t sleep for shit!!! I guess I’m here looking for something to help me through this. I have read about all I can read on the subject but I would rather know what happened to you with tramadol wd. Many have said it isn’t even a good med to get high on but the energy and euphoria I get begs to differ. I’m not sure that I even am ready to quit, kinda just seeing how stuff goes from here but I mean I’m this far in so why not. I smoked for 15 years and I had a narcissistic boyfriend who would talk crap about how I smell so I just cut it off and said screw it. It’s been years and I don’t even remember when I stopped. So far my eyes are watering, sneezing, feeling like a blob, hot/cold, I can’t eat anything, an sleep isn’t even real at this point. I’m pretty sure that it’s been like 6 days since I took my last one and I don’t even remember when honestly.

First day feeling ok wanted to share a bit and possibly get some feedback. Was using pressed m30s about 15 a day for close to a year. 4 days ago I snorted my last 15 pills. Was a functional user able to keep a stable job. Would start the morning crushing 4-5 pills and show up to work. Would keep redosing through out the day it was exhausting to say the least. I stopped completely 4 days ago didn’t feel any withdrawals until about the 24 hour mark not sure if it was because I had so much in my system or because of the fent analogues we are being pushed. Was scared to induce subs because of pwd so I rode through the hell at about 36 hour mark started slowly taking the subs first .5 waited an hour then another .5 waited an hour then 1mg waited an hour 1mg kept it up like that til I was at 7mg which felt ok. Tossed and turned that night would sleep for 30 mins then be up for an hour ugh the worst. Day 3 felt shitty in the morning started again with the subs 1 mg per hour til I was at 3 mgs. Felt about 75% and took 1mg right before trying to go to bed day 3. Wasnt able to get to sleep so I took 1mg of klonopin and 300mg of Gabba. Was able to sleep 5 hours straight. Now I’m awake feel alright. Plan is a rapid sub taper and if I continue feeling alright I may skip today’s dose. Plan was 8-4-2 ended up being 7-4-? Anyway I feel the worst of the physical is over thankfully would like to know any advice on steps after detox. Any recommendations are appreciated. Lasted a month clean last time I did this a year ago. Hopefully done for good.

Ps. I’ve had gene testing and I am a ultra rapid metabolizor. While it was extremely shitty time I think it is the reason the process was relatively quick",7

I have been down this road before when I lived in south Florida and with the help of my parents I went to an inpatient detox facility and found a doctor near me who prescribed suboxone. I was only on suboxone a month and tapered myself off fairly easily. After the hospital injections of buprenorphine I went right to 2mg suboxone and then cut that in half and tapered off. But now I moved to Orlando and I’m struggling to find a place aside from a clinic to get suboxone. I could probably do the clinic for a day or two but I know myself, I’m not a morning person and keeping the motivation to go there every morning at 6am would fade quickly and I would end up telling myself that I could just skip a pill and pick up a bag for the day and go to the clinic the next day. It just wouldn’t go well..when I was able to get a month prescription from the doctor it was great, I would be able to hold off for as long as possible until I needed half a pill and not have to worry about having to go out and get anything. I have only been back on H for about a month but that was enough time to pick up quite a serious habit again. I’ve spent this week tapering down as best I can but I know I need to get suboxone ASAP. I do not want to go to a detox again because it’s a terrible experience being cut off from everyone and I was attacked by my roommate at the last place and treated like shit by staff and it’s just too traumatic, particularly being a small 21 year old female people think they can walk all over me. I have a very good friend who is willing to help me with withdrawal which even with suboxone won’t be great but I’m ready to do it. Anyone know of any Orlando doctors or have suggestions on how to find one? Aetna is my insurance but willing to pay out of pocket if needed. Thank you in advance",4

Sweating , talking about how gangster he was. Bunch of racist shit. He did 10 years in prison. So ya that type.  Hes on his last run pretty much before he gets locked up. And i happen to be with him. Driving around so insane. But so perfectly. Super tweaker status. Not even looking and driving . Knowinf where to park .only reason i stayed in the car was out of interest of where this will go never again will i experience  this again. Were driving around bumping bay area ganster rap. Chewing are toungues off . Hes talking a mile a minute. Chewing my brain apart. Telling me im a junkie for life.just accept it. We are real ones. Been shootin  up for more than a decade .

Kratom WILL be the changing factor in you quitting and getting your life back, but even if it does 80% of the work, but you have to stay the course. I make good money, had vehicles and toys and nice things very nice things, 2 years of opiates will take it all away. Mostly I relapsed out of fear for the w/d, but Kratom will make it to where you can function and work. I recommend 7-8 grams of your strain that works best (red, green, white) and wait 45 min- an hour, take another 2-3 grams if you still feel bad. Releapt thru the first 3-4 days and then from day 4-7 drop your doses to 5-6 grams and 1 gram after waiting. If you CAN and are able, having marijuana is a great pair up to relieve even more w/d symptoms with the Kratom. And if you CAN and are able, clonodine or Xanax for sleep and other symptoms. With JUST Kratom you can get your life back tho, guaranteed, just depends on if you finally take charge of your life and take it back.",14

I have no withdraws anymore I think that’s one of the hardest parts, I don’t even crave it and feel pretty damn good every day. I haven’t gone 30 days just smoking weed for a good 3-4 years it’s crazy to think I could do that. I’m back too 68 hours of sleep a night I never have stomach issues anymore either. 

I just ruined it 3 minutes ago, I’m not sure why I made a lot of money this week and didn’t even buy a lot. Usually I’d spend all my money on it, at my worst it was 10+ presses a day as well as pure fentynal from Canada. I knew I had a problem when #4 everybody thought was fire didn’t do jack to me. I’m really glad I was able to go a month and honestly this doesn’t feel like a huge duck up to me. I’ve figured out so much about myself the last 30 days I actually feel confident again! 


My goal is to finish these few pills and go right back to being sober, it’s crazy how much easier life is without constant wds and rls was the worst for me! I had no Xanax or muscle relaxers just weed and I was seriously felt happy! I’m so glad I went thru the main real wd first and prepared myself mentally. 


I just want everybody to know there is hope for fentynal users! I’m so proud of myself for the progress  I’ve made. Love y’all and please stay safe. Nice comments are appreciated. 🖤",2

I am 6 weeks sober, with two of those weeks being tapered in Detox.

I was on 24 mg Suboxone which I  stopped taking back in late January, and immediately went back to street opiates, opana, oxycodone, etc..

I was on 70 mg methadone for about 4 weeks before detox, and they tapered me using oxycodone/tramadol/librium for two weeks. I don't feel this did much good as I immediately went into full blown withdrawal once I arrived at rehab. Had psychosis the first 3 days, brutal Insomnia for 16 days straight, RSLs, creepy crawl skin, suicidal ideation, terrible tremors in arms and jaw,  etc..

Now I am living in a sober living house and I have been eating completely clean, working out daily, doing yoga, and playing volleyball a few times a week, and while I feel much better, and have some energy & motivation. All symptoms are fairly mild at this point and clean diet and exercise has eliminated almost all of the depression and anxiety.  I have a lingering brain fog that feels very similar to how it feels when you have very bad sinus inflammation and you don't have clarity except a little more intense. It makes my surroundings seem less vivid, colors less vivid, and feels like my head has all this pressure in it, short term memory sucks, and long term memory is slightly diminished. Sinuses have been getting pretty swollen too, which is fairly normal for me, but it has been worse than normal lately as well. Arm pits are sweating mildly in the morning until about lunch time. Irritable and fatigue hits in the mid-mornings at times, and lasts until around 2-3 pm.

All of these symptoms seem to dramatically improve as evening approaches, and mostly completely fade as the sun goes down. Also, on days when the barometric pressure is high, and climate is dry these symptoms seem to improve also.

How much longer can I expect the brain fog and sensation that my skull has a brick in it to last? Sweating? All the other symptoms I can deal with at this point, but it would be really nice for the cognitive stuff to fade. ",24

These decisions have caused serious pain to the people I love in my life and have called my recovery into question and right now I'm doing everything I can to fight off the voice in my head that keeps screaming at me"" if they think you're using you might as well be using"". I know the last thing I need right now is dope. Especially since it's guaranteed to be fentadope and my tolerance has to be shot after at least seven months clean (with one slip months ago). I know intellectually that I do not want to get high, but this stupid refrain will not stop running through my head. I'm sure others on here have gone through something similar, and if you have I'd love to hear how you combated it. Using is not an option, but I haven't struggled with recovery this hard since the last time I was 30 hours into withdrawals after quitting cold turkey. Thank you all for everything",7

What are good supplements to take besides a multivitamin that might help me feel better? I feel pretty good for the most part but I want to continue being sober and healthy. 

Currently I take a multivitamin and tumeric.

Now that I have stopped I realized how much money I am able to save or use for resources to keep me busy and my mind occupied. Although I still have cravings I truly believe I can leave all of this behind me. 

Before getting clean I tried to detox over a handful of times with only making it to the second day before getting more. This time around I drank as much water as possible and although I had 0 energy I forced myself to go for walks and keep busy after the worst withdrawals were over. Taking a handful of vitamins seemed to help as well, especially high doses of B12. Just wanted to post this to give anyone else hope who has a similar story.",28

Yes, I am back on smack. And as we all know, every time you relapse, your habit gets worse than it ever was before. So I can hereby proudly announce that this super-brain here started the month clean and with the intention to stay clean forever. But instead graduated to IV use. 

But anyway, those past two weeks of pretending to be a wasted pin-cushion were fun, but now it's time for yet another detox. And this time I will try to do on purpose, what I accidentally (but successfully) did last time: comfortably detoxing on a single high-dose of Subutex.   
Last time I detoxed, I ended up doing 16mg Subutex on induction day because I just couldn't get comfortable. The result was, that induction day still sucked, but starting the morning of day 2, I felt much better. And after that, the withdrawal symptoms just never came back. After 8 or 9 days I stopped waiting and concluded that I had successfully detoxed.   
And of course I relapsed a few days later. 

So now, I will try to reproduce it, hoping that it will work and I can detox comfortably again. That would be nice, because I have to work... 

\_\_\_  
***THE MORE YOU KNOW:***   
*This is not a crazy idea by me btw. There's a few recent studys about this approach in detox and the results are really, really good.*   
\_\_\_  


**So here's the plan:**

To minimize the chance of PWD, I will already minimize my heroin intake the day prior to induction. So on thursday, I will only consume 2 ""Bubbles"", one around noon, one in the evening. I will snort them, no IV. *A ""bubble"", in case you are not familiar with the slang, is about 0.1g - 0.2g of street-quality heroin. Probably like 10% purity.*

On Friday it's on, but I will try to wait 24 hours before starting Subutex to be safe, though I will most likely be in the clear after 16 hours. I will start with 2 mg and wait 30 minutes. If nothing (bad) happens, I will take another 4 mg and wait another 30 minutes...and so on. After about 2 hours I should have taken the whole dose, which will be **26 mg of Subutex**. 

And that's it. If everything goes well, this will be the only medication I will take in the whole detox process. Or at least the only Subutex. If I have to take a bit of Kratom at some point, that's fine. Getting to a point where Kratom will even do something for me is progress.  


**What will I be looking for in this experiment?**

1. How is induction day? Does it stlll suck as always, or will 26 mg Subutex even make day 1 feel good?
2. How long (how many days) will this single dose keep me comfortable? Are withdrawal symptoms maybe even never showing up (as it happened in the studys)?
3. When the symptoms come, which ones, when and how intense?
4. Will this keep my cravings at bay and for how long?  


This is what I'll be looking for. Idealy it will go down like in some of the study-cases. The bupe makes me comfortable right from day 1 and the bad withdrawals just never show up....and after 7 days I realize that it's just over.   


I will keep this thread as a diary and to take notes, but feel free to ask me stuff, give me advise or just discuss in the comments.   


See you on Friday!",7

I’ve always been the type of person who thought that everyone else had the potential to make things better for themselves, but that I would always be stuck. During my last run, I lost nearly everything important to me. I lost my friends, I lost my significant other, I lost the trust of my family. My significant other had tolerated my shit for so long, and he finally realized the only course of action left was to kick me out. I have done so much shit that I regret. I stole from my family, I sold belongings with sentimental value, and I was constantly lying to everyone. At one point during my run, I cut contact with all my friends. 

When I finally got clean ten and a half months ago, I realized how much damage I had actually caused. I had hurt the people I loved the most, and I didn’t think I would ever be able to fix what I had broken, so I didn’t even try.  I didn’t reach back out to my friends to apologize or make amends because I figured they didn’t want to hear from me. Thankfully, I was able to start mending my relationship with my significant other, but the loneliness was still suffocating. There were so many times I wanted to just end it all. I was consumed by thoughts of all the different ways I could off myself. I wanted so badly to make things right, but I couldn’t bring myself to try.

Yesterday, I decided enough was enough. I reached out to my two best friends to apologize for my behavior and for being a bad friend. I told them how much I missed them and how I hoped they would be willing to give me a chance to set things right. I was expecting the worst, but I was greeted with only love and understanding. I had been such a terrible friend, but they welcomed me back with open arms.

Things really are starting to look up. I’ve been repairing my relationship, not only with my significant other, but with my family as well. Everyone has been so supportive and I am so fucking grateful they were willing to give me another chance. I’m back in school, I’m building credit, I’m saving money. And now I have the opportunity to make amends to my friends. Everything is a work in progress, but the important thing is to keep moving forward. I still have a lot of shit I need to deal with, but now I feel more motivated to do so. No matter how bleak things seem, we all have the ability to make a better life for ourselves. We just have to keep trying.",64

Iv basically abused codeine prosphate/tramadol/cocodamal or any opioid based drug i could get high from for the past 3 years of my life after a motorcycle accident were i first got addicted.

i went cold turkey probably for the 12th time back on the 12/01/2020 and am coming up to 5 months successfully clean in witch I'm over the moon about....

it wasn't easy but i got through it and now i have all my energy back and I'm sleeping so much better, 

my main issue is I was left with bad anxietythat comes and goes with 1 bad thought but i seem to have this under control

I've now recently been hit with a bout of depression and i have no interest in doing nothing and feel empty inside

What i want to no from people who have quit for this long is could it be PAWS (POST ACUTE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS) or have i developed a mental disorder? 

What makes me think its PAWS is because iv also recently had a bout of depression to go with it....please give me your thoughts on this ?",4

Why does everyone compare opiate withdrawal to ""the worst flu you ever had""?  At least when I have the flu I'm able to go to sleep(albeit having crazy fever dreams).  The flu doesn't cause sharp back pains or restless arms and legs.  I can get my body aches and temperature under control with some Advil.  No meds have ANY effect on opiate withdrawal, especially asprin/ibuprofen.

Where does this flu comparison even come from?  I'm confused...",26

She’d been having a rough time during the quarantine and ended up relapsing unfortunately :( Well basically she told me she’d be MIA for the next week or so during her treatment. Granted, it’s her first time seeking professional help; so idk where she got that number from. But like it’s been two weeks now, and I still haven’t heard anything from her; so I’m starting to worry that something bad has happened... Should I be concerned? Or am I overreacting?

Am I addicted to the rituals? The excitement? The culture? Perhaps it’s a little bit of each thing, the withdrawal has me coming back, the excitement brings my mind back to the ideas, the rituals have my body in a habit, the culture has my reputation dug in. I’ve managed to overcome all of these obstacles, I have no desire to return to any of these nostalgic feelings. Now to separate the physical from the mental and emotional.
My biggest question for myself is whether I can return to some things, sure I’ve unchained myself from the opioids and the benzos physically, I have no more physical dependencies and I’ve given my mind time to recover and gain an unbiased and uninfluenced view of my situation. 
Psychedelic substances can surely be mentally/psychologically addictive, and to know whether I’m ready to come back to say micro dose or have a full on mushroom trip is a big question in itself. Have I overcome my poly drug use to a high enough degree that I can use psychedelics occasionally without triggering any feelings within myself.
I have always viewed psychedelic substances in an entirely different light than any other drugs even including alcohol despite its cultural acceptance because of the spiritual/enlightening experience they can bring about that no other substances can allow. Along with the generally anti addictive properties most of the substances carry.
I think to answer this question I would have to asses the way I approach the prospect and my mentality towards taking these substances and not particularly the substance itself.",2

I was aiming for management at that time, Then everything went down hill after I was Introduced to Heroin and crack. I really didn't think my life would have changed so much so fast.
October 2019 I was still working around 52 hours a week, loved my job and the people around me and I had built up so much confidence and achieved lots with the constant training outside of work to improve myself, I was being contacted at the time by a man who I usto meet when I was going through a bad patch at 19 as a sex worker (addicted to diazipam back then) He just wouldn't stop pestering after he saw me again, turned out he had already been stalking me for some time as hed moved to my area and I was totally unaware. Anyway there I am with my life built up, good job stability and a nice apartment. I decided to respond to his notes and social media messages as I was paranoid he would take it further or contact me at work as he was that pushy type. We started to talk again as mutual friends met up the odd time to go on days out, then the offers came.. Do you want some coke, do you want any weed... I was literally tea total at the time so drug free but the temptation was there constant if he was around, I said yes to some coke so he took me back to his, had a safe in his bedroom opened it up and I saw allsorts of stuff in there (which he doesn't take drugs so I'm guessing it was all to lure young men in. Anyway he said he's some cock and gave me a rock and I said this isn't coke, he said it is but you smoke this version and gave me a small glass pipe with copper wire in and showed me what to do. I had a blast and was impressed instantly, I asked what else he had but he was quite hesitant to say what was actually there. Anyway after an hour or two of having pipes of crack cocaine I started to have a panic attack and couldn't rest so he went back to the safe and came back with a brown rock and some foil nd a half cut straw and told me that would level me out, I freaked a bit and said I know that's smack iv done plenty of drug courses at work to know but he was so persistent that it would chill me out and take the palpitations away from using the crack and it was only once so I won't be addicted. There I am smoking it off the foil, not knowing what to do properly and neither did he to be honest but after a few minutes of smoking it I was relaxed with no palpitations and anxiety, I'd been there about 3 hours now and wanted to just go home and be on my own to relax so I politely asked if he could drop me home which he did without hesitation, he gave me a small bag of both crack and heroin to take back inside with me when I got home, I didn't think I'd be tempted to use them again but having it there in front of me and knowing the feelings it gave me earlier I started to pick at it in bits. I ended up calling him back the next morning for more, within a week he moved me into his, told me I didn't need my job or flat ext, I was basically put into dream land. I ended up being stuck with him and his abusive controlling ways for then next 7 months. I lost all my friends and family, wasn't allowed to talk to anyone else but most importantly he was in control of the drugs as he got them and kept them locked up, it got to the point where I was being blackmailed to have sexual contact in return for the drugs he'd pushed me on. I didn't know what I was doing, or what planet I was on. Sometimes if he was pissed off or I said something wrong he would purposely leave me to withdraw before giving me more to keep me stable. Anyway I'm on month 7 there and I just couldn't take it any longer so I contacted my old best friend and broke down to her, told her everything. She contacted a drugs group for help on my behalf and explained my situation, she arranged to arrive at lunch the following day to pick me and my belongings up to get me out of the situation. She came with her partner and moved me and my stuff out while He was out for the day doing his dodgy deals. I was so relieved and happy at this point that I wasn't alone anymore and he didn't know where she lived which was important as he was going mental to find me and contacting everyone I knew to find out where I was and also tried to push people away from me, I stayed with my friend and her partner that night with my belongings and the day after she drove me to Inspre (a local drugs team) I was advised to go on Espranor to replace the 0.8grams per day of Heroin and I immediately said yes anything to get off this I was so desperate and weak. I was given a prescription that day which is a pretty good service, I started the Espranor and my friend said i would be staying with her until I'm better and she helped in every way she could, unfortunately the Espranor I couldn't keep down, within seconds of putting it on my tongue I was throwing up so I wasn't getting the buprenorphine needed to make the withdrawal less harsh, unfortunately I spent 6 days in bed did not eat once and could barely keep any fluids inside me, I told my worker at inspire each day via phone call and they just did not help. I called my doctor who prescribed me anti sickness tablets so I could kep water in. It turned out I had done the full detox myself without the need of any opiate replacement. It was hard and can be dangerous I must of lost 8lb from not eating or drinking for so long. On day 7 and 8 I could eat and drink with the help of cyclozine anti sickness tablets. It's now been 2 weeks, I'm still here with my friend but I have my job to go back to in 2 months and hopefully another apartment to start fresh again when I'm back on my feet financially. For all of you who think your alone don't give up there's always someone there that will help you and the drugs teams are sometimes useless but you have to be strong if you want your life back.
If anyone wants to know how I managed the full detox without help or substitutes I will post how each day went and what I did. But be strong it can be done and only by yourself.",12

I'm a healthy 31 year old dude who's been battling an opiate addiction for 15 years.  I have been on methadone since mid October , my current dose is 95mg and its been over 80mg for at least 3 months.  I've also been doing 8-10mg klonopin daily for 3-4 weeks. Last week I met with a Dr and decided to take action to rid myself of this demon on my back. I am currently rapidly tapering my methadone . My dose today was 50mg at 7am. I plan to drop 10 mg a day until I reach 30mg. Then I'll wait until I meet the criteria for the COWS and take 4mg of subs .

If anyone has done anything similar or has any advice please I just need encouragement and some hope.  I'm also addicted to weed i smoke every day, I have been prescribed seroquel for sleep , gabapentin for everything I suppose and klonopin to ease the pain of the taper and the seizure thing . I am terrified of that last dose and waiting before that sub . Thanks yall!",1

I’ve never posted on reddit but I felt like this may help many ppl rid ourselves from the devil called opiates. I’m detoxing as I text this out l.. I hope this works for you as it has me.... so far. 

So I’ve detoxed more time than I can count. Every time I used no subs no methodone I did it cold Turkey. My first time around I was weening myself off of dope, fetanyl.. whatever their putting in this bull now a days. The first time oct 12, 2019 - oct 19, 19 I did this I was Weened down from 2 bundles a day to 8 bags but I didn’t ween off the Zanz  about 5 bars of Zanz. A day. The first day I had 5 seizures. I lost my memory as a week into my detox I decided to go to a detoxing facility. I refused methodone as it’s been a whole week since I’ve touch an opiate. I get there to the detox facility and I was bad. They didn’t properly ween me off the zanex and I was shakin uncontrollably. I had an intensive outpatient program (2weeks after discharged from the first detox.) set so I figured once I get there— they will help me. No they sent me back to detox bc of how sick I visibly was. So I completed that detox as well. It wasn’t so bad since it’s been a whole month since I decided to detox at home.  I was discharged from the 2 detox and jus couldn’t believe how I was still suffering. I had headaches every day and cried and cried bc I wanted to be free from this evil (drugs) that’s had a hold onto me. I pushed to Go to the outpatient and they helped a lot. Welll since corona virus and my program being closed I messed up doing about 8 bags a day. I tried weening but it’s super hard. Ok after about 2 weeks of playin with the devil I decided to put myself through the agony once again. I’m like the 4/5 day I jus couldn’t do it. I didn’t have the will power or strength. So as u know I started back up again. Now 5/17/20 I’m at it again. This time prepared. I have caspres, gabapentin and I know I know (don’t replace one for another says ppl that don’t understand how bad detoxing is. You literary feel like the devil is releasing ur body and causing pain and agony. So I had a tho and tried it out Zanex fkn really really helps. If help u sleep eat everything. I feel soooi good (not high) but I would never think I was detoxing.  So the point of this Reddit. Try takin these meds especially the zanex jus for a few days, while ur detoxing. It helped me soooooo much I jus had to share bc I’ve read so many Reddit’s where ppl are goin threw this and yes we can go to detox but think about it. What does the detox hospital have  that we can’t get. We can get stomach pills and whatever else they give. Wouldn’t u rather detoxing from the comfort of ur home where U can be comfy in your own bed and smoke ur cigarettes and eat what u feel. 

Good luck and God Bless you 
Prove them haters wrong get clean and get back to your lives and tell ppl that  doubted u to kiss ur ass!! Once ur up and doing well, watch “friend  each out but we’re never there for u. Feed off the strength to prove them wrong.  !!! You can do it! I had a very bad habit. And I’m makin it out lil by lil. And it’s not goin to be easy once ur clean, ppl will talk and judge but fuk that. Let them walk a block in you shoes and see how hard this is!!! But u got it. If I can so can u. 

PS I do no use any subs or anything like that I feel like they don’t work and the side effects suck but u can do it!! I feel better now than I have in a long time and I  jus tho this may help someone.

PSI forgot to mention upon going to my intensive outpatient program I was also diagnosed with PTSD. BUT I urge anyone whom is very sick to just go to a detox clinic. I am still suffering everyday from my decision to cold turkey it is horrible.  I now have to see a neurosurgeon and try to figure out if any of this is reversible. My memory is shot (exp; I had a dog for 2 years and had no recollection of having her which make me so very sad. This is no joke. Just bc you stop your DOC it doesn’t mean it’s done with you!!

I’d be happy to help any one that would like support or are thinking of doin what I’ve done and need be advised not to!!",12

2020-05-17 17:09:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/glng37/one_thing_i_realized_during_recovery/,One thing I realized during recovery.,"Most often, we seek to use drugs for one reason, to get high. Because getting high means that we are above our reality and experience it from what we perceive as a better point of view. Drugs will often do that. Mask the reality with some vision that we hold of the world and of ourselves. But my discovery lead me down a different route. How can we experience highs when we don’t experience lows? I had to ponder it myself because it is a hard question for an addict to face. What lows? The only time I experienced low was when I wasn’t getting drugs. And this was quite low, so my perception of low was quite skewed as well. To me, low meant that there was no way up. Low was somewhere I did not even want to be, because I knew that low meant that I wasn’t high anymore. But the more I went to those highs, to keep me from being at the bottom, the closer I felt to the bottom when I wasn’t using. As I sunk lower and lower, I finally realized that the drugs weren’t helping me achieve what I really needed. Our world is certainly non-binary. There isn’t just low and high, but a million in between. We must embrace every part of this life and realize that there won’t be “highs” in our life, without “lows.” As a matter of fact, the “low” points in our life are the things that are meant to make the “highs” even greater. And when I was using, all the million things in between became irrelevant so I only ever experienced high or low. If I don’t allow myself to feel everything and deal with it then it’s not going to work.

It’s an actual badass job that I’ve done before and loved doing, but I have to train for 3 years to graduate to the position I want but the company is going to pay for it. Basically it’s a lifer job, full benefits and other than early mornings I’ll be set. I don’t want to be in withdrawals when I start. Anyways I was smoking BTH, running through at least a gram a day probably more and I was feeling dysphoric as fuck, the opposite of what I wanted, I’ve also noticed that my ADHD meds stopped working on this stuff and seroquel no longer works either and both of those have never stopped working for me. So there was something bizzarre going on with it. Took some supposed sub tablets, but I’ve been taking 8mg for 3 days and they barely did anything, and I’m usually well off of 3mg. I can’t even tell if they are real or not. Been taking kratom along with subs as what’s important to me is to quit Fake H above all else. But I’m stopping today and I’ll see where I land if the subs actually worked or not in a couple days. Too much fake dope and I can’t deal with the unpredictability of the supply chain, plus dysphoria is not a good side effect. Fuck this shit, the move is going to do wonders no connects and I’ll be away from crowds of people so as long as I can weather the PAWS storm I should be fine.

I was clean for a week before this. Doesn't even do much for me anymore so I don't know why I relapsed. My sleep has been practically non existent so maybe that's why I caved. I don't want to set myself back any more. The past few months have been torturous trying to get sober from different substances. Also, things aren't looking too good for the economy and in the event of civil unrest, I don't wanna be a slave to any substance. I want my mojo back. I was much more functioning before I started using drugs as an escape. Do you think my withdrawal will be as bad as before? I never seem to get it too bad. No RLS, not much vomiting or physical symptoms but the mental shit, the anxiety, the insomnia and feeling incapable of doing the most fundamental task is what gets me.",4

It’s been a couple of years since our intense use, and we have come so far. I’m not mad at him, and but I’m terrified to take the wrong steps here. Opiates aren’t a life I can get back into, for so many reasons. We had no respect for each other, we were always broke, and the shame was unreal. I am terrified that he will fall back in and I’ll have no choice eventually to say goodbye.

The thing is, no matter how strong my resolve is, knowing he has been meeting our old dealer has me feeling such strong temptation. I’d never forgive myself, and I’d certainly resent him in a way. But I’m sure the folks here can understand the periodic urges. 

I don’t know if I’m supposed to tell him how I’m feeling. I am incredibly proud of him for telling me, we’ve been through similar in the past and I haven’t been able to trust that he’s telling me the truth. But I have huge hope for us because I asked him and he actually gave me an honest answer. That’s got to be worth something. I don’t want my urges to break the platform that he’s using to not fall back in completely. 
I’m also scared if I tell him I’m having urges that he won’t be able to tell me NO. he loves me and I don’t believe for a second he’d want me back on pills but I don’t want him to see it as a green light so to speak. 

How can I help him? How can I keep myself strong while staying strong for him? We have been so good to each other since and like I said we have come so far. We have covered leaps and bounds since we stopped using. I don’t want him to feel shame, but I need us to be strong and for him to realize how risky this is.

We had talked for a longtime before that when he wants to get clean, i'll be there for him however best i can. I'm terrified of losing him. I'm relocating for my new job in August, and we talked about him moving with me so i can be a live-in support system and he can get far away from the temptation of reuniting with his drug friends and dealers post-quarantine.

&#x200B;

Has anyone done this? Is this stupid? He--according to him-- wants to stay sober. I believe him, but I don't know how much to believe him. I don't want to enable him--that's terrifying to me--but i also don't want to alienate him from me when he needs help.

What do healthy boundaries look like in this situation? I want to be able to bring knowledge to the conversation when we talk more about what this will look like.

When would it be time to leave him (i.e. he's stealing my shit. i don't think in his current state he would, but if he relapsed hard.... i dont know) and what does loving but not--being-able-to-trust-them-100% look like?

&#x200B;

I don't want to naive as i've been sober all my life. i also don't want him to die, and i want to do what i can to help. I don't think my specific problem will be so much personal willpower as it will be not being an enabler or forgiving unacceptable behavior

I have a pretty typical oxy story. I got them from a Dr. for pain. I have Tri-germinal neuralgia. But it’s not so bad. I like pills. Let’s face it. 

I’ve been on them for 5 years. I’m at the max mme now, and tolerance is an issue. I’ve been supplementing with online orders. Which have gotten bigger and bigger. Now suddenly I’ve got a 1K a month habit along with my 5 dollar copay. 

I’ve tried to quit and run out early a few times. I’ve used Kratom which helps a lot. I can sleep and shit with it, but I hate the way it makes me feel and it makes me so dehydrated. It isn’t a sustainable answer.  But a godsend for withdrawal. In some ways it has made it worse, because I know that although I’ll be miserable, I won’t be legs shaking no sleep miserable, so I’ll take more oxy. Before I found Kratom, I’d make sure I had enough piills to last the month. It’s a curse really because it’s only cuts down 70% of the symptoms for me, but that is enough for my junkie mind to run our early every month. 

So I talked to my Doc. and he got me my medical card. I’ve got a temp. one. My real one comes in the mail in the next few weeks. I’ve got an appointment with a “pharmacist” at the cannibals place tomorrow but I was hoping for some good advice here. I want to get off the oxy. or at the very least cut way back. Does cannibals help? I smoked some in high school 20 years ago. I liked it ok. I had a few times I smoked too much and had a heart racing panic attack thing happen. 

My Dr. swears by it. He says he see people get off pills within 6 months on a regular basis because of weed. Is that true? Will it help? 

Thanks for the input!!!",16

It’s been almost 60 days since I quit opiates cold turkey. It has been a rollercoaster of getting in touch with myself again, and for now, an ongoing one.

The first twee weeks felt like a pretty big obstacle, And now I mainly deal with a lot of tension, trying to recognize addiction thoughts And trying to give myself space.

It’s definetly been tough, trying to keep long term goals in mind.

But Also good things have come my way these past two months.

Being jobless, I have being doing my best getting a new one, And the fruits of this labor can finally be harvested. Because I got a full time contract going for me, which felt like an huge accomplishment. 
I Also had a date, which was Nice, although it led to Nothing, which is real fine by me.
I have made steps to getting my debt in perspective and getting support from my city, to get things resolved.

All together it is something to be proud of. And I can honestly say that I deserve to finally acknowledge my own accomplishments.

Someone even wanted me to write a story, as to what is still possible with the Corona pandemic going on. Which feels like an honourable thing to do.

To everyone out there still struggling to stay clean, or who is still using:

You can do it.

It might take time... you are no doubtly are going to fail sometimes.. But it is a process.
Time, a will to change And determination will together will get you Where you want. In time.

I believe that everyone deserves a second chance. If only people would give it to themselves.

Have a good day, And stay strong.",4

Today is the longest I have gone through withdrawals and although I am feeling shitty it is still giving me a light at the end of the tunnel.

I weened down to only 7.5 mg doses of Percocet at a time which I believed helped immensely as well as drinking over a gallon of water a day.  Because my wife does not know I have this habit she just thinks I am sick and gets me out of the house for walks and so fourth. I woke up today and don’t feel as bad as I thought I was going to. The no sleep is the killer, but I took some Tylenol pm to aid me and that helped a little bit to get 4 hours in. I have read stories about people having miracle withdrawals or very short withdrawals.

But I ran into some money. Now I’m out of it. I’ve been doing 2 pills every day for about a little over two weeks now. I’m going to have to detox for a third time and go through hell. 

Every single time I detox, I lose my goddamn mind. I get so much anxiety and so depressed that the clinics I go to for detox end up sending me to a crisis center to make sure I don’t hurt myself. That wouldn’t be bad, if they actually gave me medication there and there was more to do than sleep all day. 

I’m going to have to try to do this on my own, especially because I don’t know if any detox center would be open anymore because of the pandemic. I have xanax, gabapentin, suboxone, vitamins, bud and shatter. Everything I could physically need, but nothing to help me emotionally get through this. 

I guess I’m just complaining. And telling you all, before you relapse, think of shitty you felt when you had to detox. That should be enough to stop me from relapsing, but for some reason, it’s not. I hate myself.

Edit: my boyfriend is going to be helping me through this, thank you all for the support and worries. I am officially starting detox either tomorrow or thursday, as I’m waiting on some money so I can buy some more wax . My boyfriend said he will help take care of me- make sure I eat, help me take baths, get some naps in so I’m well rested, make sure all my medication is set up and ready to go. I am so, so very scared and anxious to be doing it at home, but at least I will have the help and love from my boyfriend that I am very much going to need during all of this. 

Thank you all for the support.",12

I still get little cravings here and there, but I'm able to fight them off pretty consistently. I thought I would be abusing codeine for many more months but life seems to have given me a sign to stop. 

Any tips to make the cravings go away? The high is not worth the price for me anymore so I doubt I will end up back on it, but there's still a part of me that just wants to be buzzed while hugging my cat.",7

It's my way of trying to retaliate and make the woman feel responsible or guilty and upset. Sometimes it even helps win arguments or sympathy visits. Normally the overdose is an exaggeration and I try to do it a day or two after the breakup. 

So I had a breakup on Monday. This time I relapsed 12 days ago before the breakup cause this one was way more painful for me... she hurt me really good. She is in recovery too but for alcohol, it's her first attempt and only has 10 months. Anyway the other week I actually did overdose twice, once on IV coke and 3 days later on IV dope. She didnt really seem overly affected by hearing that news which pissed me off... her narcissism and selfishness is off the charts. Look at me though lol. 

Anyway I'm wondering how many people can relate to this junkie manipulation? 

On a positive note I havent relapsed since the breakup so tomorrow is day 13 for me. We go on the same Zoom AA meetings and its been so tempting for me to just curse her out in front of everybody. She fuckin posted a bunch of shit on facebook about the breakup for everyone to see then blocked me.

 I have way more recovery in my 13 days then she does in 10 months. I'm trying to ease the hate and resentment as my sponsor reccomends. It's not easy tho, definitely a whirlwind romance the whole time. When we met I had a year and she had 60 days. 2 kids plus a baby daddy that she ditched for me. Of course I was going to prove everyone else wrong by having it be a successful relationship. Now my friends are all ""I told you so.""",5

I originally posted this on the loperamide sub but since that place is pretty dead I figured i'd post it here too.

NOTE: If you aren't interested in the backstory but still want to help, skip down to the last 5 paragraphs

Posting this on a throwaway for reasons that will soon be clear.

Most of you probably know that a lot of opiate users get addicted to lope because they used it to get off of another opiate. Not the case withme. I had very little experience with other opiates when I got started on lope. Prior to it I had only done oxy and codeine maybe 20 times over a 10 year period. I knew lope was used by opiate addicts to ease WDs for a while but I had no idea you could get high off of it alone. I did have lots of drug experience, just I was always an amphetamine guy.

The first time I took it, I fell in love. I took 48 pills/96mg. I felt pretty damn good. The euphroia wasn't as intense as oxy or meth, but it absolutely wiped my clinical depression away for 36 hours. And amazingly to me, when it wore off, there was no horrific crash or intense cravings like with meth, I just felt baseline again. It also helped my social anxiety out a lot and I started talking to and hanging out with people that I havent in years because of my old meth addiction(Which I quit doing about two years ago), my life improved dramatically, for the first time in years I was happy.

I started off taking 48 pills every other day. After a month of this 48 just wasn't cutting it so I upped the dose to 60. I kept upping the dose every few weeks, and about three months in I started feeling the need to take it every day. or so until April when I plataeued taking 200 every day. Then something terrible happened. I'll be honest, I'm not trying to quit because I want to quit, but because my method of obtaining the pills is no longer sustainable.

You see, I learned to shoplift during my meth days. I'd consider myself a near-pro at it, as I've done it so many times for so many years without ever getting arrested. There were 3 occasions where I was followed outside by an employee and told to give the shit back, but the cops were never called. I was also very careful, if I felt like anything was off even a little, I simply dumped it and left.

You guys probably aren't going to like this, but I became incredibly brazen with the amount of lope I stole. I knew of every pharmacy and grocery store within 30 miles that sold them. I'd avoid certain higher security stores like Target and a regional grocery store known for having good security. However, rite aid, walgreens, CVS and Dollar General were basically a free for all for me. I'd simply walk in and if there were no employees in the lope aisle or the ones next to it, I'd emptythe god damn shelf in to a reusable shopping bag. Some places I went had 5+ bottles of 200 pills and the same amount of 96ct and 48ct ones. I could sustain my daily 200 habit for a good while just going to CVS and emptying the shelf once every week and a half or so.

Then suddenly, no matter where I went, finding any bottles bigger than 24 became damn near impossible. Emptying the shelf went from sustaining my habit for over a week to a day, maybe two days if I was lucky. The only places I've seen more than 24ct in the last month were a few dollar generals that had 48s once in a while.

I decided it was time to find out the minimal dose I can take and not feel sick(I tried going a few days without taking any when i still had a lot of them. I'd be relatively fine for around 36 hours after my last dose, then I'd get hit hard by the withdrawal train. I felt worse than I ever did in my life, it made the depression I felt after quitting meth look like nothing. I couldn't sleep at all, I got BAD restless legs that was pure fucking torture. My 70 degree house felt absolutely freezing most of the time except for every 30 mins when I'd feel very hot for a minute, become drenched in sweat, then suddenly feel freezing again still covered in sweat.

That was my ""oh shit"" moment. After some experimentation, I found that the minimum dose I need to not feel incredibly sick is around 75 pills/150mg, taking that amount does not make me feel anywhere near good, it just stops every second from being pure fucking torture. and the minimum dose I need to be able to function at all in any way period is 48 pills/96m, still sick but not so much I become non-functional. 30 pills basically did nothing besides lessen the RLS by like 20% and make the hot flashes less frequent.

Do you think if I went to a doctor and told them this (minus admitting to shoplifting), they'd give me suboxone or something even though I never got addicted to a ""real"" opiate like oxy and heroin?

I'm terrified. I only recently found out that the withdrawal would last months, I though it'd be mostly over in two weeks like it is with heroin(at least so ive been told), but no. I can't live like that for two months. I'd rather feel like I did coming off meth for 10 years than feel like this for 2 months. And there's another roadblock to getting subs, I do not have insurance or a job and I live with my Dad. He does not know of my habit so I'm not even sure if he'd help me or tell me to just deal with it. If that ends up being the case, is there any way I could go about getting it for free? Possibly by applying for medicaid or some kind of government program thing?

Lately my daily dose has been whatever I could get on that particular day. Sometimes 48, sometimes 72, and occasionally going up to 96 or 120 pills if I got particularly lucky.",5

I never wanted to be in this position again,  but how many times have we all said that?

I had only been sober for about a year, before that I had used about a year. I’ve gone through withdrawl too many times to count now.  The worst symptom for me is restless leg syndrome. I ordered some compression socks off the Internet. I was wondering if anyone else had some tips or tricks to help with this? I’ve got Pedialyte, vitamins, and jugs of water. I also have one 8 mg strip of Suboxone. Can anyone else share some thing they wish they had when withdrawing?

I cut off circulation to my arm and now have chronic neuropathic pain. I also developed chronic tension headache soon after the OD which in my opinion has been the worst part by far. I have endured mild to severe headaches everyday for a long time now and no doctors have been able to figure it out (even with an MRI and blood work). For perspective, it's made it impossible to even have even half of a beer without feeling incredible pain immediately, lasting for days. The nerve damage in my arm has impaired my ability to write much at all. Before this, I could do these things like anyone else. This one night, three years ago, has left me with constant, intractable pain for years and no reason to believe it will ever get better.

After my brief rise and fall (started on 20 mg oxy at a time to taking 200-300 mg a day all in roughly 6 months, 2-3 relapses in between), I have made it 13 days without opiates. 
(okay besides the first two days I used subs, <.5 mg a day just enough to sleep).

So I always hear the PAWS phase usually starts getting better around 2 weeks, however, within the last few days I noticed a huuuuge drop in motivation and negative thinking about myself.  Before I was feeling a huge burst of motivation and excitement about life despite being incredibly sick. I was more productive than any peak moment of motivation in addiction or for a while before even. 

Now I wake up and feel like what’s the point and am flooded with feelings of helplessness. Zero drive, I can’t get any pleasure out of anything at all. I went from setting financial and personal goals and working towards them to being so physically and mentally drained I can’t find any fucks to give anymore. 
Everything I’m doing is just to kill time and make it to the night when I can finally sleep.

Anyone have experience or words of encouragement? I know I can stay clean this time but not if my motivation doesn’t come back.

**I also forgot to mention I popped one 30 on Friday before I left town for the weekend as a flare up in my pain triggered me. I wake up with sweats still and have minor RLS but the physical flu like symptoms are pretty much gone now. The fact that physical withdrawal is still somewhat present gives me hope this is still due to abstaining from oxy. can stay asleep for at least 7 uninterrupted hours of the night as well.",1

As of 6 months ago I’ve begun the long journey of tapering again, last time I tapered slightly and then quit cold turkey- it was the worst decision of my life and sent me into mania then the extreme depression described above. I want to avoid that at all costs so this time I’ve come down 50mg at a time, I got to 75mg but then this quarantine fucked me up temporarily and I’m back up to 250mg. Anyway, I just really need some hope that I can taper off this shit successfully and not be left with a completely dysfunctional brain by the end of it, I know the brain takes time to heal and I can deal with that, but I’ve dealt with severe depression my whole life and this was something else entirely man, theres no way I could survive the 6 months or however long the brain takes to heal living how I was last time I quit, I’d rather be a fucking addict for the rest of my life that’s how bad it was.

Has anyone else ever experienced this and how did you get thru it?

Will I be able to avoid this by tapering slowly (already 6 months tapered and will probably be tapering for another 6)?

What I’m terrified of is that I’ve fucked up my brain chemistry permanently, that because tramadol is both an opiate/antidepressant mix that my dopamine receptors are completely fried and I can’t recover them... is this true or am I just paranoid??

Has anyone else successfully tapered off huge doses of tramadol?",10

Question is. Last time I was in a detox and then outpatient program. I was dropping piss once a week. Well it was I believe day 17-18. I went to drop and still had very very very minor traces of fentanyl in my system. I couldnt believe this. I know fentanyl is one of the shortest acting opiates you can do. And I was heavy on it. A gram to 2 a day for a long time everyday. But still..... so I was wondering. Is this the reason i feel so fucking hammered out for 3 weeks after last use? I mean it’s clearly better after the first week. But I feel like some of the shit I’ve still went through weeks after that is just a little extreme compared to others. So I just didn’t know if this has happened to others? Is it because my metabolism is super slow? Or something simple like maybe I just didn’t drink as much water through

Patients who prove opioid dependence can be prescribed heroin a few times a day and inject at a clinic. Predictably, deaths go way down when doctors get involved. And petty crime goes down, and the market for illicit opioids goes way down because no one wants your shitty fentanyl and crushed aspirin combo disguised as heroin. 

But the part I’m struggling with is, how many people are still addicted because there’s less pressure to quit? I went to rehab when I ran out of money - I didn’t really choose to quit, although I swore to myself almost every time I shot up that I was going to quit this time, but then forgot that promise every time I got sick. I didn’t really decide to stay clean until a few weeks in treatment, when I had some more perspective. 

What about you?  Did you get clean because you got sick and tired of the constant cycle of staving off dopesickness, or were you forced into it (and glad you were)? If you could have stayed on heroin indefinitely with heroin-assisted treatment, would you be sober today?",3

When I decided to ask for help I was desperate to stop using and willing to take some suggestions from people who had long term sobriety. It was hard at first but it got easier after a while. Since I got sober I’ve experienced freedom from drugs, but more importantly felt free from the insecurity, self doubt, fear, and inflated pride and ego that caused me to use in the first place. 

I guess the purpose of this post is to give some encouragement to those out there struggling and share where I’m at. To anyone trying to stop using, take it one day at a time and don’t give up. Sobriety is possible and attainable, it’s up to us what we do with it!

I'm just sick of the whole process. The hour long waiting period before you can drink that bitter water followed by a mild euphoria that goes away much faster than it came on, leaving you irritable and anxious. 

I'll be playing games with my friends online and I'll be a lot more subdued and get angry at them more if I didn't take codeine

Aside from that, it's way too expensive a habit to keep up once the pharmacies recognise what you're doing. Every dark net dealer has hiked their prices - a single dose would cost me at least £20 now and there's a million things I can think of to spend that money on.

I want to say that Kratom may have been partially responsible for this - but not in the typical way. I received a bad batch that was making me nauseous and puke at higher doses, and I barely even felt it. It just felt like a dirty buzz. I finished the bag out of habit, but after that experience I'm never ordering a bag again.

My boyfriend is working through sobriety, and he has been for a year with three short periods of relapse. He agreed to go to online meetings but says he will not actively work the steps because “he doesn’t need to”. He thinks he can remain sober without a program and without a community even though he was an addict for 6 straight years and his addiction wrecked his relationships with his family and sent him into financial ruin. He says plenty of people work the program and still get addicted again and there are some people that don’t work a program and can remain sober. As it is, if we broke up, he would be homeless. I don’t want to enable him, but he’s getting really angry when I set boundaries like saying he has to be a part of a program and go to counseling for us to move forward together. He has agreed to both, but then made the qualification that he wouldn’t work the steps of the program. That made me uncomfortable. 

He says he doesn’t want to be treated like an addict, but... he is one. I know that I have no experience with this personally, and I have tried to do a lot of research so that I didn’t say the wrong thing. I spent a lot of time reading when he relapsed so I wouldn’t make him feel guilty or like a failure. He isn’t a failure by any means- I understand that addiction to opiates irrevocably changes the brain and that his journey through sobriety will be a lifelong pursuit. The problem is.. he doesn’t seem to feel the same way. He keeps saying he wants to “live a normal life”. I don’t know what to say to that, and any time I bring up the merits of investing in a program, he tells me I have no idea what I’m talking about because I have never had an addiction. 

Any advice for me? Also, I hope this is allowed in this subreddit. Forgive me if it’s not the place.",3

I see people have their sobriety date listed by their name. I don't want that to be part of my identity so focal. I want to be me, yes I happened to be a junkie and then maintenance, but I don't want to throw it at people.

It wasn’t a crazy amount, but I was steady snorting about .25 grams a day. I stopped cold turkey Monday night, knowing I will have to drop a pee test tom, Sunday. I’ve been running about 5 miles every day to try to get my metabolism going to expel the shit from my body. The withdrawals haven’t been too bad, I’ve been managing them with kratom and I’ve been able to sleep every night. I’m still feeling some physical symptoms of withdrawal, but I’m through the worst of it. I’ve got about 110 hours clean right now. 

What I want to know is will I be able to drop a clean ua tom? Is there anything I can do besides drinking copious amounts of water to help me pee clean? I’ve read in some places that like after 3/4 days I should be good, but I’ve also read that some people drop dirty for like weeks. 

Given the fact that I exercise, only used for a month, and haven’t had terrible withdrawals, what are my chances that I’ll be good on my piss test tom?",2
2020-05-09 09:53:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ggfs7e/day_4/,Day 4,"Hello all! This is actually my first post on reddit and just want to share my experience battling opioid addiction. 

It all started about a year and a half ago, ended up messing up my back and having to see pain management and getting a prescription of norco. Beginning was ok and I actually felt functional on the meds. Knowing better I should’ve not taken that route because that same year I lost my brother to H and two years prior same thing with my father. Really could have been taking the meds for numerous reasons; pain, depression, energy, etc. 

Well leading up to the last 8 months the typical spiral with opioids happened to me. Tolerance went up and was taking too much. Started with 3 a day, 4 a day, all the way up sometimes to 10-15. ( yes I know I was fucking up my liver) in those moments it felt like I had no care in the world, just the feeling of euphoria and the happiness / no care I had when taking them. 

Leading up to now, 5 days ago I ran out of my RX two weeks early. Told myself enough is enough, and to stop myself while I’m ahead. So today makes day 4 for me! 

Typical WD have taken place, slight chills when sleeping, aches, NO energy whatsoever, RLS, and I have previous depression and anxiety ( given from losing my brother and dad ) but I keep telling myself to push through. I know I’m not in such a bad place as some other people are but mentally and physically it has taken a toll on me. But brighter days are ahead and I feel like I can reach them. 

Also throughout this I’ve done this completely cold turkey, no subs, Kratom, benzos, etc. Just natural and pushing through. 

Really just want to say that everyone has such a different burden on their backs, but I pray for everyone on this forum, hoping each recovery goes smoothly as it can, with a brighter outcome for everyone. I can’t wait for the day I feel back to normal before starting this crap. 

Much love, you can do this!",8

Time to make a change. Long.,"I thought this was the best place to go, because this drug caused me this worst problems and also gave me the most enlightenment at the same time, tho not always through positive experiences. 
I always thought of myself as someone in complete control. When I started partying at 20 I thought I had the leg up on everyone else who started in their teens. Now I'm sitting here 6 years later, barely able to move, 80 lbs lighter on my couch unable to sleep because of what my sense of control got me into.

I was diagnosed atypical depressive untreatable so I took to self medicating at those words. They gave me a max prescription of adderall for my add (double what I need on a bad day) and a max prescription of xanax for general anxiety disorder.
For two years they were my best friend and I was your usual bartard for the time, until I fell in love with lucy and got lost in the sky with diamonds for a year. I quit xanax for more visuals. I still have visuals from the binge 4 years ago. 

After lucy started giving me paranoid delusions and what I had come to realize was REAL anxiety, I started taking xanax again. Roughly 3 years ago. 
Lucy told me there was no cure for depression but you can live with it. I took it as the biggest fuck it sign and let loose as possible. I wont go into quantities and substances all of us here have done ungodly amounts of something to everything at  one point. Just know xanax was at the root of all of the poor choices. 

It wasn't till I met my love, my vice, my personal devil I could hide on my pocket wherever I went. The one that tells me I'm as amazing as I think I am. The one that makes me forget about all my pain, physical and mental. The one that carried me through turmoil. Or so I thought until she taught me misery loves company. Fentanyl. I thought I had my control. On xanax your a slave. On opiates your a slave. On both, your indentured. I was never me on the combination.  And I despise the person it creates. But thanks to xanax making me forget or say fuck it all too often, and the allure of pure euphoria and no insomnia kept bringing me back.

Around the time I started messing with the hard stuff I met the real love of my life. I got clean. I relapsed about once a year for a few months and spent the rest of the year recovering. That's been my last 2 years. I decided to quit xanax 2020 and I just got off my habit last month.
Were selfish creatures by nature, and I embraced  it. And that's not what you want to embrace on the most selfish drug around. 

TL;DR: As well as last paragraph: It wasn't until I got dosed with carfentanil for the first time. I relapsed 4 or more times this year. It wasn't until I came to covered in bruises sweating profusely on the floor with my girl caring for me. I did something I've never done before today. I put myself in her shoes. Anyone else's for that matter. I know a lot of this is rebound remorse, but I broke down. Started bawling my eyes out for putting anybody through this. 3 months ago her best friend ODd in my arms from the percs I got for her, from the hit we took... and i didnt have any narcan on hand so I gave her CPR till she could get to a hospital. I thought that's just part of it and kept smoking like nothing fucking happened dude... I've lost count of my ODs, and I shouldn't be here to tell any of you any of this. My girl has walked in on me blueing out too many times. And no one should have to once let alone however many times she's saved my life. I never thought if I found her like this until today, I would die. Im so extremely lucky to have her and am doing everything to make a better life. I finally broke my selfish streak for the first time ever. I turned down 3 different perc plugs today and yesterday. Told them never to me again. It hurt, and it that's the addict, but me, the real me, was undeniably relieved.

I'm only 3 days clean so it's easy to say for an addict I'm done but for everyone I love and that loves me;

I'm done.",9

I originally was planning to white knuckle my way through the recovery period , in talking to my doctors shrink , therapist , sponsor and a lot of time to think about it I don’t want to face the recovery with no pain relief. So I have discussed with my doctor taking a low dose pain med for a few days post surgery if needed, it sounds like it’s one of the most painful surgeries to recover from
 (-according to my doctor and a couple friends who have had the surgery) So I’ve talked it over with everyone and my fiancé will be controlling my medication dosage and timing, I’ll check in with my sponsor every tine I take a dose. Continue to do meetings and hopefully recover quickly and easily. The reality is I don’t want to cause myself unnecessary pain through something like this if this can help. I’m also concerned about taking ANY medication. I feel like I have a solid game plan but I’m just nervous. It’s something I’ve put off for about a year due to the recovery being kind of daunting. So I guess I’m checking in for accountability and advice, support or personal experiences regarding this. I’ve done a ton of dental work in the last couple years and done it with otc’s , this just feels a little different. Thanks in advance all. I hope you are well and clean this beautiful day.",2

2020-05-07 22:10:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/gfkd8l/son_getting_mom_off_drugs/,Son Getting Mom Off Drugs,"I am extremely thankful for what you are doing as a community on this forum. You are genuinely changing lives by bringing people together and showing them they are more powerful than their addiction.

My name is Tyler and I am 24 years y/o from Toronto, Canada. 

I always knew growing up, that my mom was addicted to opiates because it was never really hidden from me. Drug vocabulary was very prevalent in my family from an early age, and we even began to take trips to the methadone clinic every Thursday, so mom could get her OJ. I can remember as a young child, seeing my mom dig her teeth down onto a leather belt, while we watched the TV in the living room, just to try to get through the agony of the withdrawal. I knew she had a drug problem but I always thought it was pills like, pain killers and that she would just deal with her addiction in her own way. (Boy, was I WRONG)! I began to become more passive and numb with the whole situation as I got older and as the negative patterns became a repetitive frequency loop of realizations and let downs.

The emotional conversations always seemed to happen around major holidays after a long night of eating and drinking excessively with her family. One Christmas, she broke down and asked, ""if I told you I have done needles would you give up on me and leave my life?"" Those kind of words would just tear me apart because there is nothing I want more than for her to feel enveloped by my love, compassion, and support and to know that all the emotion I show, whether it is negative or positive, is out of absolute passion for her well-being. This conversation was where I realized for obvious reasons that the problem has grown into a monster that is now unignorable and needed to be addressed. I knew that I was in for a rollercoaster of deep, devastating lows and possible fulfilling highs from the emotional war that I was about to take on.

I decided to take the approach of starting an entirely open dialogue, where we would be able to talk honestly about her pain and addiction that she has been going through for the last 20 years. A lot came up, like almost everything! I learnt that she had been shooting pills for many years while taking methadone at the same time and that her life revolved around those drugs. Of course it has gotten painful at times to understand the severity of the situation, and it is defiantly a strange thing when your perception on someone, especially somebody you love and have ""known"" your whole life, changes and you are able to see them differently, like in a whole other light completely. Different than the comfortable boxed up, ideologic version of a person, that you have built up in your head. But I believe that embodying unwavering love, leading by example, and creating a structure of support, is the most important thing to embed in her mind that I am with her for everything, through it all, because she is worth it. 

Our first real conversation was long, and emotional, but those hard conversations are determinably necessary for anything in life worth working on and bettering. It took a whole year of those challenging conversations to build this new style of tell me anything/ honest speech, that I noticed her narrative shift from self pity loathing in her situation, to optimism and hope for the future. 

I challenged her to strive to be her best self by embracing discomfort and tackling difficulty by enacting a type of mantra, ""you have to be your best self, to give your best self."" She began by quitting her long time addiction to cigarettes and started to become more excited about her newly found ability to create monumental, incremental successess in life. (It didn't just stop there!) 

5 months ago my mom threw away her needles in front of me without me even addressing the subject, all on her own free will. That was a POWERFUL moment. That's when I knew she meant it because I had lived a life her closetting the most major part of herself from me, to putting it all out on the table and making the decisions and most importantly taking ACTION! 

She has been going down 2mg each week since she has quit the pills and as of this week she is down to 12 mg of methadone! I am extremely proud of her and I can tell she is really proud of herself because she says it often and tells me that her methadone doctor believes she is going to be a success story. She just recently started telling family that she has had a problem and that she is on the road to recovery, she says it's best to tell people because it motivates her to succeed, and people are welcoming her with open arms! Although there are a lot of positives right now, I do still see moments when she doubts herself and gets overwhelmed by the possibility of a withdrawal  that is unbearable to the point of relapse. She doesn't know the road ahead of her and her anxieties often become an instable in her recovery. It is hard for me to get in that mindset myself because I have never quit a drug before and I have tried to explain to her in a recent conversation, that I am there emotionally but it is hard to talk so much about the drug aspect of things. She has voiced that she would really like to connect with someone through pen pal or video chatt that has gotten off opiates and methadone, to talk about what their experiences were like because a lot of the information online is very generic.

What do you think the best way is to go about our situation during this pandemic? Not enough people are addressing how hard it is for people that are dealing with mental health and addiction during these hard times and how there are limited resources available. Is there anybody or any groups that we can reach out to online to get some guidance.

Thank you :)",11

I wasn’t a full blown addict and I never had it half as bad as some of you on here but I’m struggling. After the last year of taking perc 30mg here and there I had fun. Never became dependent. Then I got introduced into pressed pills. They were cheaper and got me much higher. Only took them for about a month and a half (much more often than I would take the real script 30’s) and by the last week of that month it was an everyday thing. By myself too every night. oh did I feel the consequences though. I honestly think I’m done with the physical withdrawals at this point (praying) but how do you stay busy or find joy in things. I used to be able to binge my favorite shows. Now I can’t even stay interested in it. I have zero sex drive (which is killing my boyfriend). The sun is nice and makes me feel good but when that sun goes down it becomes 10x worse. Some days I wake up super happy and rested, other days I don’t. 

I don’t crave the high but I miss it as something to do and have fun with friends. This quarantine is not helping either.... I don’t know what answer I’m looking for but I just want to understand and educate myself more on what is happening to my body. So I don’t end up here again.",5

Today I have 9 months off heroin.,"Today I have 9 months clean off of heroin! I did it only with the help of a long inpatient and outpatient program, with vivitrol maintenance, and after multiple attempts to get my shit together. I had to move states and leave behind everything I knew, to get away from the people/places/things and finally focus on myself. 

Back then, the idea of even getting a couple months was a distant fantasy. I was convinced it was impossible. I knew that I wouldn’t survive without the numbing; I knew it was useless to try. I had accepted that I would be a junkie until the day I died, and I knew I’d die sooner rather than later. 

Just know that you are never beyond hope. Any and all of us have the potential to turn things around, to leave behind the pain and misery and hell of addiction. I didn’t realize the truth and power in taking things one day at a time. I’m not a full believer in 12 step programs and I don’t understand my spirituality. However, the serenity prayer holds so much truth and meaning to me. All I can do is focus on what I can change today.

It was hell I never want that again. I finally started feeling better, almost perfectly fine about 2 days ago. Anyways last night I did a REAL perc 30. I shouldn’t of. I wasn’t craving anything and I wasn’t feeling bad, but I did it because it was there and I thought I would be okay. Anyways my question is will I withdrawal again after that one perc I did last night? I didn’t get high or anything but I’m so fucking terrified of going through what I went through the last week. Will it be as bad? Will it even happen? Please someone give me some insight.

Update: 48 hours after relapse or fuck up: back hurts just a bit. Nothing ibuprofen and Tylenol can’t handle. Sweating and chills are here but not as bad as they were last week. And yeah sleeping is eh. But hey I think I’m going to be good. Thank goodness",1

Well naltrexone as a pill doesn't work if you don't take it. And that's what i did. After a little more then a week i stopped taking them.  3 days later i tried to get hi but failed. It took 5 days of trying to break through until i finally was able to feel high

Now here i am a few weeks later. Fully addicted again and scheduled for a vivitrol monday morning. Today i need to quit but since I'm all alone im reaching out to my OR fam for the help and encouragement it takes to beat the mental aspect.

Day 7 off the subs, 12 years on after a 3 year pill habit (South Florida 2005-2008) , never saw a dr, friend went to VA and would give me around 20 subs a month. Got my life back together, went back to school, got married, job, kid, house, etc....... well I always knew I didn’t want to take them forever and when my buddy moved away, he gave me a few months notice to start weening down. Took around 6mg a day for 12 years , give or take 2 mg. When he announced he was moving I was at 8 mg a day. Over the next 2 months I got down to 1.5 mg a day, then in a week got down to .5 mg for a few days and ran out. So the first 2 days weren’t so bad then the 3 rd day was a little worse but still not like waking up pill sick. RLS is the worse part at night when I want to sleep , always been a good sleeper . Got some kratom and only took at night for day 3,4,5. Then last night I took some before bed, woke up at 2 am with RLS and surprisingly fell asleep eventually. Ordered some good magnesium that’s coming today on my day 7. Haven’t thought about kratom and really trying not to take more than 10 grams a day , I’m sure you know why. I’m at the point now where withdrawals come and go but aren’t steady or too bad. Part of me keeps telling myself to man up and weather the storm. I also try to take comfort that the pain I feel is my brain trying to work normal again without help. Stay strong if you are in the same boat ✊ tapering make a world of difference but at the end of the day, we all react differently. My buddy that moved stopped going to VA and didn’t have half of my withdrawals, which weren’t too bad anyway. Day by day , and keep the mind busy 🤟",13

I just felt like I needed to get this out of my head. 

Basically I was an IV heroin user for nearly 15 years and am coming up on 2 years clean of it. But I have almost certainly switched my DOC to booze. I've always drank to a certain extent but its very apparent to me recently that what I'm doing isn't healthy. I think I tell myself that it's a lot better now because I don't have to do the things I did to get money for dope like before and also because I can follow a schedule and dont start drinking until the late afternoon. Never minding that I'm waking up late in the day....

But I'm worried that I've sort of convinced myself that what I'm doing now is acceptable because hey at least I'm not shooting dope. But deep in my heart I know that this isnt healthy and honestly doesnt feel good at all...but I guess I'm worried that there wont be any better way for me, so I should just accept this as the best its gonna get. I dont know how to function without the promise of some altered state and it's pretty scary and I dont think I can pretend this is OK much longer.

I'm diagnosed as bipolar (with a mostly inactive eating disorder) and haven't had my proper meds in a year but it's difficult to get them financially and also just because of this...rut I guess, that I've found myself in. But I think I'm also worried that they wont solve this either? And like I said, a part of me wonders if I should just accept this state because it's really so much better then when I was using heroin. I've tried AA/NA/rehabs and I seem to always end up in the same place as now. I dont even know how to begin fixing it.

Sorry for rambling, I'm not even sure what I'm trying to say except that I'm scared that I'm always gonna be like this",3

We checked myself into inpatient and the plan was to spend one month in rehab and two to three months in a halfway house. I ended up staying three months in the rehab and I’ve been in the halfway house I’m living in for six months. I should mention that I turned 21 in rehab. 

About a week ago I was given a discharge date of the 18th. I couldn’t be more anxious. I have spent the last week trying to find low income or section 8 housing that will accept public assistance. I have a job lined up but due to the quarantine I have no idea when I will be able to work. I have tried dss, the local housing association, and many many listed apartments/craigslist ads. 

So I am potentially facing homelessness in two weeks. I feel so overwhelmed. Sobriety seems futile. I am already having thoughts about picking up dope again and now on top of that once I leave here I will be able to legally purchase alcohol. I’m sure you guys know the sensation of desperately wanting to get high. The only place I can go if I can’t find housing is a homeless shelter and there’s no way I will be clean if I go there.

So at this point I feel stuck. Complete ambivalence. Even if I do manage to find housing I may be motivated to get drunk or high. Even though I’ve been clean for nine months ( well and above my most amount of clean time) I can’t stop thinking about getting high. If anyone has any advice they could give me it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1

Three years ago today I was a few weeks pregnant, running to the city everyday getting ripped off 2 buns a day and a half a gram of rock. I was reckless. I didn't give a fuck, in fact I loved it. I hated life I hated fucking everything and I was hoping I would die. I wish I could say this ended when I took a pregnancy test. I had the decency to stop slamming coke, but I kept using right up until I gave birth. I hate myself for this, but I am so incredibly lucky because my son is now 2, I am going to school (4.0 gpa), and am finally able to support him.

I hated myself for my pregnancy and drank the first year of my son's life. Fuck it, it's not dope right? Wrong, it just started that thinking and replacing one vice for the other. I overdosed 2 weeks before my son's first birthday. I went to rehab the next day and have been clean ever since.

I truly do not think I could have done it without vivitrol. I go once a month and don't have to think about it. I don't think about drugs or alcohol. I love it. I feel no shame in having the help of vivitrol because it has helped me stay clean through the death of my mother last September.

This is a rant because I just noticed the date and was thinking about those who deny themselves a happy life because of their past or shame of being on MAT. As long as you are doing the program correctly and making steps for yourself to improve that is all that matters. Thinking about the past and hiding in that shame will only put you down. Fuck anyone who doubts you. Life is going to be shitty for the first few months of sobriety but the absolute pride you can feel of living a year clean and making improvements for yourself is the better than any nod you will ever fucking feel in your life.  It's also a gigantic fuck you to any pieces of shit who look down at you as another useless junkie, as a treat.",5

I had eight years clean, but then relapsed last year. I went to an inpatient medical detox where they gave me a sub taper. It worked and the withdrawal symptoms were minimal. 

Fast forward to now and I’ve found myself shooting up again every day, I’ve been at for about a 3 weeks. It started with me ordering tianeptine online because I thought I could indulge without running the risk of dependency. I failed miserably. Now I’m doing dope and supplementing tianeptine when I run out of dope. The withdrawal symptoms from tia seem to be WAY harsher than the heroin. 

It really sucks because I’ve accomplished a lot in this past year while I was clean. Got a really good job with benefits and matching 401k, moved to a near by city. Found an amazing girl that I care about and that cares about me (it kills me that I’m not being truthful to her). She knows about my past. I want to get clean, I just don’t know which route to take. 

I can’t do in patient detox again due to work, but I’d like to get off this before I become too mentally addicted. Right now I feel it’s mostly physical. 

So my question is what is the best way to kick this that will allow me to still work everyday? I know for a fact that I won’t be able to work if I’m withdrawing. Should I do a sub taper on my own? Or go to a sub doctor and do it his/her way? I just need some advice. Thanks for reading.",1

I’m 221 days off of fentanyl after years of using it all day every day. 

For me, my acute withdrawal symptoms lasted for about two and a half weeks after my very last use (I weaned myself). From there until about a month and a half, I was riding that pink cloud. I felt good. I had confidence in my recovery and was extremely proud of my progress and had a sort of natural high going for me. 

Then I hit the two month mark. 

Things went downhill pretty fast after that, and I didn’t realize until quite a bit later that what I was experiencing was PAWS. I got extremely anxious and depressed, was so lethargic that even simple tasks were painful and exhausting, and I was suffering from chronic pain all day every day. Especially in my legs. It would keep me up at night and make me unable to sit still and relax during the day. I would take several hot baths a day to try and get some relief from the pain. I tried all sorts of medication—Tylenol, ibuprofen, gabapentin (prescribed), lyrica...I tried working out. Nothing helped. No matter what I did, my legs ached like crazy and as weeks turned into months with no break in the pain I felt myself slowly going insane. 

I don’t use that word lightly. I already suffer from some pretty serious mental health issues, but I have never felt so insane and completely out of mind as I felt 2-3 months into recovery. 

All of these symptoms accumulated into me becoming extremely suicidal and having to check myself into the hospital, where I spent some time in the psych ward. Thank god I did, because I was very close to seriously hurting or even killing myself. They adjusted my psychiatric meds and set me up with some intensive daily therapy after I was released, and that was enough to keep me alive the next couple of months. 

It wasn’t until about 5 and a half months fentanyl free though that the pain finally stopped and I had a real turning point in my recovery. The day I woke up and realized that I hadn’t thought about my legs for awhile was one of the happiest days I’ve had in years. Finally free of chronic pain and with my depression better under control, I’ve plowed through these last few months with an newfound confidence and determination. 

So, what about you guys? What has your experience been with the symptoms that follow the initial acute withdrawals? How have you managed to cope and keep moving forward? 

Stay safe, and best of luck.",3

Any tipps? Is it normal for pain to be worsened in detox and does it get better?

Just realized this would've been our busiest day at work if things were still normal 😭 (I work(ed) at a Mexican restaurant). Man i fucking miss that place. Miss the shit outta my coworkers, I can't wait to see my kitchen boiz I know my kitchen manager knows imma straight tackle his ass when I finally see him 😂  

Got my pretty much last day of school today. Im mad pissed, someone from the school responded to my question about online summer class times and basically told me none of the times were gonna be displayed so I'd just have to wing it and like I guess drop out of a class then attempt to reregister if one ends up not being at a time that works?? Like how fucking goddamn stupid is that? Idk maybe I can find a way to email the professors directly and ask them about class times but a. It shouldn't be their responsibility to field questions so easily answered they got enough to do already and b. I shouldn't have to do all that fucking leg work just to find out the dates and time of a class anyway!!  

Anyways. I was zooming with my mom and dad the other night and my dad brought up (with nothing but good intentions) how he flew out to Vegas when I moved from there back to the east coast to help me drive my stuff and the dogs across the country. It was literally the first thing he did after he retired was flew out and did that for me, what a GOAT lol. But I was suuuuuper dopesick on that whole ride back, it was awful. I hadn't thought about any of that trip since it happened really, and my dad was trying to get me to remember the first day when he came and picked me up and all of a sudden I got this fucking GNARLY vivid flashback about that day and it was so so so awful. I was staying in a shitty hotel room in downtown so I could do a jail visit with R in the morning before I left but ofc I ended up driving back to my old neighborhood to cop before that and ugh I don't even wanna get into details but it just really brought me back to those moments.  

I guess my parents, who are not sensitive at all and are more of the ""suck it up and laugh at yourself"" type (as am i) must've seen my face when I started remembering it and my stiff upper lip British mother actually straight up said to me ""don't think about that stuff kollaps3, you've come so far from there and improved your life so much, that's all over now and you never have to deal with it again"". My mom is NOT the type to say shit like that y'all!! I think my face looked so terrified and freaked out that her like protect my kid instinct kicked in to reassure me not to think about that stuff. Really means a lot to me.  

How is everyone else doing? This nice weather has got me insanely antsy to go outside. Yesterday I straight had mad urges to just pack a bag and go catch a freight train and just live outside and travel for a few days lmaooo I love my non homeless life and haven't had an urge like that in ages but man being cooped up gets to ya. I hope everyone else is hanging in there; some other countries have seemed to have gotten their case numbers substantially down in recent days so fingers fucking crossed the US won't botch this and will keep up with testing! Love y'all and I hope everyone has a great day 💜",8

The other side is just hours away. But man, this detox was weird. What was supposed to be day one was a desaster. I did very little heroin the day before and waited about 20 hours before I started with 4mg subutex. No PWD, but not much relief either. So I did another 4mg and barely made it through the first half of the day. So another 4mg. And when 12mg buprenorphine wouldn't make me comfortable, I was quite desperate. Desperate enough to relapse on heroin at 10 PM. The heroin had little to no effect, all receptors blocked. But I slept like a drunk baby — and the next day, I felt fine. Like, really fine. So I decided to wait for withdrawals to hit me again before I take my next dose of subutex. It's been over 3 days, still waiting. I can't believe it, but I cheated withdrawal somehow. I mean, sure. I AM in withdrawal. It's just so mild that I don't count it. Cold chills, sweats, mild stomach discomfort, unstable mood...but soooooo mild. Totally bearable. I even hung out with my family on the weekend and had fun. On days 2 and 3 of heroin detox.

I am procrastinating super hard on finishing my final essay for my English class and I am locked out of the website im supposed to take my math final on because the fucking school chose to make students do ""free trials"" that last for a week and you have to contact tech support to renew every time they expire (which takes at least an hour every time) instead of just paying for the fucking software themselves... so a whole bunch of pain in the ass shit. I'm completely done with one of my classes and just have one last quiz to take for another though so that's cool.  

Also been trying to register for summer classes and obv they're all online but for all the dates and times it just says ""TBA"" uhh like I know they're online but there has to be like scheduled zoom class meetings right? This whole distance learning thing has been frustrating as fuck, us students have received little to no help from the school with anything other than a few shoddily made hasty webpages on the colleges site explaining basic technology related shit, and for whatever reason they didn't mandate the teachers to actually hold class, so for two of my classes, one of them being fucking precalculus, I'm literally expected to like watch a few videos and just teach myself this shit... like sorry man, I could do that for fucking free, I know all this was unprecedented etc etc and they had to put all the distance learning shit together in a rush but I mean I pay to go to a class and get taught the information not to watch YouTube videos and figure it out myself.

How is everyone today? I hope y'all are doing well 😊 for anyone in their first few days- hang in there, you are slogging through hell right now but it's the most worthwhile journey you will take in your life, if you're really struggling and have the energy to do so try to make a list of all the things you'll be able to gain in life now that you're not using drugs anymore! For anyone in the first few weeks or months feeling down or depressed or listless, you're doing amazing and have made it so far, what you're feeling is completely natural and although it sucks super hard while you're dealing with it, it is worth it, you have done the right thing, you are incredibly strong and things will get better, I promise! And for anyone who has multiple years, thank you for still being here and being an inspiration to all of us, we are all grateful to have your support and wisdom here in the community as we all continue to try our best to lift each other up and strive towards overcoming our addictions and bettering our lives!  

Whew that was way more positivity than I thought I had in me this morning 😂 shit, good to know that I can kinda reach inside myself and grab a good outlook like that even if I'm feeling kinda blah and shitty...

Basically I was on 8 mg of Suboxone and I have successfully tapered down to .5mg

I am having a really difficult time getting down to .25.  Has anyone else experienced getting really rough symptoms with that jump? I just want this to be over!

I’m supposed to be completely done with it by May 14. It’s May 1 right now. Dr. has been prescribing Klonopin As a support medication, but I’m taking up to 3 mg a day.

So...

+ Has anyone else experienced a really bad situation when getting to the very end of your taper? Do you have any recommendations for me? I have two weeks to basically jump

+ The reason I have two weeks is because my doctor promised to put me on a Librium Taper to get off of my benzodiazepine.... He claims the anxiety is going to be terrible. Does anyone have experience tapering off of Benzos with Librium? He wants to do it over the course of 30 days, but my experience in previous rehabs is that you should just pound it for the first seven or eight days to get the Clonopin out of your system and then basically stop. I don’t want to end up addicted to Librium and have to taper off that as well. I don’t want to taper off of third medication. Has anyone had any positive experiences?

+ does anyone have any advice for those terrible mornings where you wake up and have to wait like three hours for your sub to make your body stop feeling miserable? Kpin helps but only a little.

FYI, I tried kratom as a supplement to rase the withdrawals, but it actually made the next day morning withdrawals much worse so I don’t think I’m gonna use Kratom at least until I’m completely done spend I jump. 

Basically, what do I have to “look forward to”?

I am interested in the weeks/months/years **after** the opioids have fully exited the body. It's clear that a few weeks/months of just abstinence is not enough to reset the brain (users report ""tolerance"" goes down temporarily but ""memory"" is intact when they resume usage - proof that receptors didn't reconfigure - also relapse and post-acute low energy symptoms are common). Intervention seems worth it to speed up recovery.

&#x200B;

1. LDN: I read that a few mg's of naltrexone daily will block the opioid system including the endogenous opiates needed for motivation. But at the same time, that kind of dose is reported to be helpful in a number of conditions, so perhaps it's worth sacrificing motivation and making life harder for weeks/months to help the brain heal quicker.
2. ULDN: I read users using mcg doses of natrexone to either prevent tolerance build up or decrease it. It seems that it is making the receptors revert towards their earlier state, it's quite impressive.
3. Full dose (50mg): seems to be the prescribed dose by doctors for opioid post-withdrawal treatment, but that could be more to physically prevent relapse rather than necessarily an optimal dose for someone who is definitely off and just needs to fix post-acute symptoms and heal.

So would you use LDN, ULDN or full dose (50mg) to speed up brain recovery and reset receptors? I don't know if the tolerance/reset effect with ULDN also happens with LDN. I can't assume so because naltrexone has very different effects at different doses (ULDN vs LDN vs full dose 50mg)",0

I guess I will just have to to come off another time and in the meantime try to stay on my stable dose instead of hitting it hard just to numb the anguish, I know there's always something and we look for excuses, but jeez this latest one takes the cake!

I am currently struggling with an addiction to the dope (mostly fentanyl) and need help beating the withdrawals and getting clean. I have been using almost everyday for about 2 months now (not long but long enough). I was clean and a recovering addict for over 3 years (January 6, 2017 to be exact) and ended up relapsing due to a moment of weakness and fell right back into the addiction I worked so hard to overcome 3 years ago. Being an addict was the darkest days of my life and my biggest fear is falling back into that lifestyle. In those 3 years of recovery I moved back to my hometown, closer to my family who I am forever indebted to for everything they did to help me get clean and stay clean from opiates. I found a job that I enjoy and have been employed by a great company coming on 2 years now. I am financially stable and take care of my own bills, live on my own, etc. I worked hard to get where I am today and am willing to admit my mistake and want to correct it and get clean and back on the right track before I end up in the hellish lifestyle of being an addict again and lose everything I have gained in my 3+ years of being clean from opiates. Rehab is not in the cards (I can't afford to be out of work for an extending period of time) and either is a detox facility. I am reaching out to you guys for advice on the best way to deal with the withdrawals (I have been through withdrawals before and know what to expect for the most part.) I do not expect them to be too severe as I have been only using daily for a few months now. I have heard about kratom and heard it has done wonders for people going through withdrawals, is that something any of you would recommend? And if so, what would be the the recommended course of action for using it to help overcoming the withdrawals? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2

This is going to be a very strange, unique (and long) story, so please bear with me. But I promise it's an interesting/bizzare experience report worth reading.

Quick backstory. Over the past several years I have developed a MAJOR oxycodone habit. We're talking 350 - 370mg per day, divided into 60-70mg doses taken every three hours from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep.

Unfortunately, after years  I finally ran into supply issues mainly due  to corona. This meant that  I had to cut back SIGNIFICANTLY over the past week, reducing my daily dose by more than 75%. Obviously, it's been painful, but managable so far.

That all changed yesterday at night. I knew I had a bunch of Targin pills (40mg oxy/20mg naloxone) in my posession, but in the past I could never find a way to take them without giving myself precipitated withdrawal. I get precipitated WD even if I take 1 uncrushed Targin pill orally! I guess I'm just way more sensitive to oral naloxone than most people.

But being in a desparate situation with my stash dwindling fast, I decided to try to experiment with   them again. I read online that the melting point of naloxone (when it turns from solid to liquid) is around 200C while for oxycodone hydrochloride it's somewhere between 220-270C. So I got a brilliant idea. What if I set my oven to 210C and put the targin pill inside to get rid of the naloxone, leaving behind just oxycodone?

I decided to use half of a pill, so around 20mg oxy/10mg naloxone. As soon as I put the pill in the oven it started to release a liquid and sizzle. I thought, hey it's actually working! However, after about 2   minutes in the oven the pill turned into this caramel-like stretchy brown goo which quickly turned hard. It looked weird, but when I re-weighed the leftover amount the mass of the pill dropped by how much I would expect it to drop if the naloxone got removed from it.

So I proceeded to eat (chew into pieces) the resulting hard, brown caramel-like substance. Some small pieces broke off when I was putting it on the scale, so to get them into my mouth I pressed my thumb against the digital scale a few times (this will turn to be significant later) to get them to stick to my thumb and then I put them in my mouth.

At that point, I had no idea that I just bought a fast-lane ticket to hell and had it stamped. At worst I thought I would get a bit of precipitated withdrawal like before when I tried to take Targin, or it wouldn't do anything. Boy, I was SO, SO, SO incredibly wrong.

After 20 minutes, my stomach begins to hurt and I immediately rush to the bathroom. I sit down on the toilet and within minutes, something  weird is happening to me. The best way to describe it is as if my blood was suddenly replaced by ice water. I felt the MOST INTENSE chills and I started sweating profusely at the same time. I also felt nauseous. But that was only the beginning of the ride. Next, I feel my mind start to slip (anyone who has taken large doses of psychadelics knows the feeling when you suddenly realize that it's starting to kick in).

Within minutes I'm laying down on my sofa and I am completely losing touch with reality. I've taken a lot of psychadelics in my life, but this was  something else. I wasn't able to think straight. I would  completely  zone out for a few seconds and then come back and wonder if this was real life or a dream and keep praying for it to stop, asking myself WTF was happening to me over and over again. There were no hallucinations or visuals at all (just some audio distortions), but I was extremely confused and out of it. It was much closer to a delirium/psychosis than a psychadelic trip. I would compare it to my MXE experience, but while MXE was fun, this was extremely unpleasant and dark.

On top of that mental terror, I was also experiencing the worst withdrawal symptoms I have felt in my entire life. My whole body hurt immensely and it was violently and involuntarily jerking and twisting into weird and sometimes painful positions non-stop. There was a strange sensation in my mouth and throat as if I was about to throw up, but I never did, I just kept burping all the time. Of course, all the other typical WD symptoms like sweating, uncontrollable yawning, chills were present too. But the psychological aspect was by far the worst. It was like a bad dissociative trip and I seriously thought that I was about to die at one point.

I couldn't understand what was happening and WHY it was happening - all I took was some oral oxy and naloxone! I even contemplated calling the ambulance at one point, but I could barely operate my phone. It took all my tripping  experience and willpower to remain as calm as possible given the  situation, remain grounded and to not do something stupid, but I was scared shitless. I was GONE. If anyone walked into my apartment  and saw  me they would have called an ambulance immediately (or an exorcist). I could also barely walk, my coordination was completely messed up.

While this was happening I ingested 80mg of oxycodone hoping to put a stop to the nightmare but that barely did anything. I also ate a bunch of benzos  to try to stop the horrible jerking and body twisting and to calm myself down. These also only helped very little. For two hours I was in absolute agony, delirious, twisting and jerking on the couch, before the effects finally started to subside and I was able to lay down in bed. I don't know when I finally fell asleep, but it's been about 6 hours since the whole experience started and I feel mostly back to normal.

This wasn't anything like any opiate withdrawal that I have ever experienced. I have tried taking Targin before (even crushed) and at worst it made me feel shitty for an hour, but it wasn't unbearable. But this was literally 100x worse than any opiod withdrawal I have ever experienced. It was a trip. An awful, scary, painful trip that I wouldn't wish on even the worst criminals. It was pure mental and physical torture. It was my worst drug related experience ever by a long shot and I'm an experienced psychonaut who went through some challenging trips. I'm really struggling to even put into words how horrifying, painful and scary it was.

On r/drugs I originally posted 3 theories as to what happened to me:

1. Burning the pill in the oven lead to some weird chemical change, creating a different chemical compound (very unlikely).
2. That it was all a result of precipitated withdrawal.
3. That my digital scale that I bough a few months ago from some guy online (it looked brand new and was in original packaging) was either malicously or mistakenly contaminated with a highly potent dissociative/deliriant drug which I ingested when I pressed my thumb against the scale a few times and put it in my mouth.

After doing research, I found case studies of two heroin users going into precipitated withdrawal involving delirium after switching to suboxone. I also read that: ""A high incidence of delirium (20% over a period of 1 year) following rapid opioid detoxification with naltrexone and clonidine has been reported in methadone-dependent patients.""

So now I'm starting to think that it was just an incredibly bad case of precipitated WD involving delirium caused by the naloxone, which I didn't actually manage to remove. The only question that remains is why I'm so incredibly sensitive to oral naloxone. There must be something about my physiology which dramatically increases naloxone uptake into the bloodstream from an oral dose.

Either way, I feel lucky to be alive and I'm really shaken by the experience. Please be EXTREMELY careful when taking any opiod antagonist (naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine). If you have a big habit these drugs can cause unimaginable amount of pain and suffering as I learned yesterday.

UPDATE 02/02/2021: I just came back to this post and throwaway account and it looks like people are still stumbling across my story every once in a while. I just wanted to let everyone know what really happened that evening, because I only figured it out a few days after I wrote this post. The burnt Targin pill that I talk about in the story had nothing to do with it. In the story I failed to mention that around 20 minutes after I ate the burnt Targin pill, I felt that nothing was happening and that I was in fact feeling a bit worse so I decided to snort a bit of oxy from my stash of regular oxycodone pills (without naloxone in them).

That's where the fuck up actually happened. I had a leftover 1/4 piece of a Targin 40mg pill which ended up among my stash of regular oxycodone pills by mistake. You probably see where this is going... Yes, I snorted that piece containing 10mg of oxy and 5mg of naloxone thinking it was a piece of a normal oxy pill. Now while naloxone is barely active orally, it gets absorbed pretty damn well and pretty damn fast if snorted. So I basically narcan'ed myself by accident while already feeling shitty as a result of being on much lower amounts of oxy than I was used to taking. The hell that I describe in the story started a minute or two after I snorted that piece, so that's what actually set it off, not the piece of burnt Targin pill that I ate (although a small amount of naloxone was probably absorbed orally even from that piece to add to the misery).",35

Hey guys, I need some help. I’m 23 days clean off DHC that I had taken since I had SPD during my pregnancy 2016. So basically 4.5yrs of daily use. It was only about 2 years of abuse (for genuine pain relief reasons) and when I jumped I was taking 18x30mg tablets. 

The pain in my pelvis is debilitating and causes issues with walking/standing for long periods. I have a disabled blue badge for my car, I use crutches when it’s bad and I know if I ever get pregnant again I will most definitely be in a wheelchair. 

Now that I’m off painkillers I can’t take the pain. OTC doesn’t work, kratom doesn’t work. I called the doctor who said the only options are physio (who aren’t seeing anyone just now) and painkillers. He prescribed 15mg codeine which I reluctantly accepted. I battled with what to do because codeine has never worked for me then took them. Nothing. I called today, again explaining that yes I was physically dependant to DHC before but I need genuine relief. He’s prescribed 30mg tablets now and I’m to call next week to speak to my usual doctor. 

What can I do? This problem is lifelong and I have other disabilities so I’m terrified of having to say no to pain relief for the rest of my life, and that will seriously affect how I can live my life. 

HELP!!",3

Does anyone have any experience with my situation?

I have researched and bought every type of OTC sleep meds Mg, Melatonin, valerian root, “sleep” tea, nothing works unless I take a high dose of lyrica (which I don’t want to do because I barely have RLS anymore, and I don’t want to abuse any drugs anymore, and the tolerance is rapid).

Should I go see a sleep therapist or psychiatrist? I have been in bed since 10am and can’t sleep. I have proper sleep etiquette. I exercised 4 hrs today, and I still can’t sleep. I’m not taking any stimulants. 

I love working out so this lack of sleep is annoying. It’s affecting my QoL. I have asked in a recent for tips and tricks. 

A little history - I have always had bad sleep etiquette, stay on my phone too much, never exercised, watched tv on my bed during the day, had a night light, didn’t develop a routine , but I did do thhat on H, as I backed off the ambien/benzos. I haven’t used benzos or ambien in like 3 months, and no H in 2 weeks. 

But now I want to know 

1. how long on average did it take you to regain a normal sleep schedule back? (How long did you use and what did you use)

2. Is there any device/pillow that assists with sleep?

3. Is this normal? Like for nothing I can fall asleep. Been in bed 10 pm phone off and still couldn’t sleep, I’m still awake at 530 am. Like I’m about to go for a bike ride, because I still can’t sleep. And I woke up 7am yesterday. 

4. Should I see a psychiatrist?  (I can’t admit I’m a recovering addict, but I can admit that I was prescribed a lot of ambien and Xanax)

5. Have any of you guys tried seeing a sleep specialist for your opiate induced insomnia, and what were the recommendations? 

6. I told myself at 35 years I was going to stop using benzos and ambien as a crutch for sleep. Then I got addicted to H. I’m 35 atm, so it just happened that when I wanted to get clean from H, I knew I had to quit benzos/ambien as well. Do you think I should restart the benzos/ambien until a few months then taper? 

7. Mirtazapine and those type of drowsy antidepressant drugs that has antihistamine properties only make my RLS flare up. Do you guys know of any other non “habit” forming PRESCRIPTION drugs?

8. Do any of you guys on methadone or subuxone ever had issues with sleep? I’d assume not since receptors are being stimulated right? 

Just a side note: I’m not on any type of maintainence therapy so my opiate receptors are not getting stimulated. I feel high af after my workouts though. But of course it’s not as intense or long as H. And doesn’t make you nod off.  I’ve use these drugs as crutches for too long. I’m getting older and I need to start a family and stay in shape. I can’t be popping pills here and there. 

Thanks in advance.
