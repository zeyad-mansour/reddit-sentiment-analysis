We both decided it was time. So we got loaded waiting 25 hours than took 4mg sub. Mind u we have a huge bottle of gaba 600mg and xanax 2mg and Valium 10mg. So let’s say it’s going well. All I’m saying is if u prep enough ur good. Haven’t had shot of wd really. Just stay strong everyone. This was a 12 year run for me. Best of luck I hope this helps someone.,2
2019-10-30 23:29:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/dphxlk/welp/,Welp,"Today is almost my 41st day off oxys and 17th day off subs and today’s the first day that I had to face life (shit) hitting the fan while sober. My car has been giving me trouble for like a month now. Nothing too major...until today. Something punctured my oil pan on my way home from work today. I obviously immediately had to stop driving the car because it can burn up your engine completely otherwise - even I know that much. I literally just sat in my car and bawled for a good 15 minutes because I’m so sick of the shit that keeps happening with my car. Plus, I haven’t been saving to buy a new car, so I was just panic stricken and overall sad about wtf I was going to do. It’s the first time since I started my recovery that I was really thinking about relapse and how nice it’d be to have something to take the edge off of such a horrible situation. Anyway, long story short, I’m having my car towed tomorrow morning to a dealership. It’s a 2010 car, so if it’s more than $1,000 to fix it, I’m just going to say fuck it and buy a new one off the lot. Probably not financially wise since I have next to nothing as a down payment if I buy one tomorrow, but my car is like $3-4K max at resale value anyway. Why pour all this money for it to crap out on me again next month for something else?? Anyway, I’m ranting. But I’ve calmed down and I’m actually really proud of myself that I didn’t immediately call an Uber to go get high. I still don’t even feel physically great, much less mentally/emotionally with all this new bullshit. First of many of the trials and tribulations of sober life to come, I suppose! Lol",2

#BUPRENORPHINE/SUBOXONE FAQs 
####a reference guide for all things bupe related
--- 

###Sub/Bupe defined; Available formulations & dosages; What it is prescribed for & who can prescribe it:

**What is suboxone?** Suboxone is a brand name drug manufactured by Reckitt-Benckiser that is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio. It is a powerful semi-synthetic opioid that is most commonly used as a maintenance medication for people that are opioid dependent; however it can also be used for a couple other purposes that will be covered in this guide. It is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment because it is only a partial agonist and doesn't have all the awesome euphoria associated with most opioids. It also has a ceiling effect that keeps people from just upping the dose through the rough and getting high like with methadone.

**What forms and doses does it typically come in?**

Suboxone strips(or generic strips): buprenorphine / naloxone 4:1.

Subutex: buprenorphine 

Generic tablets: buprenorphine/ naloxone 4:1

*DOSES AVAILABLE*: 2mg, 4mg, 8mg, 12mg

**Lesser common formulations of bupe:**

Zubsolv: slightly differing from suboxone, Zubsolv is made with a different formulation that allows the body to absorb it better than it does suboxone - which therefore increases it's bioavailability in comparison. It comes in 2 strengths: 1.4mg bupe/0.36mg nalox (equivalent to 2mg bupe/0.5mg suboxone), and 5.7mg bupe/1.4mg nalox (equivalent to 8mg bupe/2mg  suboxone). This form of bupe also is known for its minty taste, while subs are citrusy. 

Butrans Patch: skin patch containing buprenorphine, worn for round-the-clock treatment used in Pain Management for moderate to severe chronic pain. 

Sublocade: a buprenorphine injection, typically received once per month, that has a different delivery mechanism and different requirements than the other available forms of bupe/sub. [Here](https://www.drugs.com/sublocade.html) is a good reference that breaks down the info about the injection and explains its uses, doses, mechanism, and how to get approved for this type of bupe treatment. 

**What is bupe/sub prescribed for & Who Can Prescribe it?**

Most commonly used in addiction treatment as a form of MAT (medication assisted treatment) for those opioid dependent. It blocks full agonists which discourages use/relapse while taking it, and is known to help many people with cravings.

It is sometimes used in Pain Management, and while some do not find it to be effective in treating their chronic pain many people do find success with this treatment and benefit from bupe's good analgesic properties, which are often found best effective for pain in low doses under 1mg.

Less common, bupe is being used in some studies and medical facilities off-label in managing depression in patients with treatment resistant depression.

Buprenorphine can only be prescribed by certain physicians, requiring a special course & license in order to be able to prescribe it. It is typically prescribed by addiction specialists, pain management doctors, sometimes psychiatrists.

**How many times a day should bupe be taken?**

Ideally it is best to try and stabilize and stick with taking your dose just once a day, as part of MAT encourages this to help discontinue addict behaviors like redosing. However, some people swear by doing best on ""split dosing"" aka dosing twice a day, and this dosing regimen is frequently used when taking bupe for pain management purposes. 

**Can you take bupe/sub while pregnant?**

Buprenorphine on its own is safe to take during pregnancy, however Suboxone is NOT due to naloxone being potentially harmful to fetuses. Pregnant women on suboxone are switched to subutex, and typically advised to not discontinue their bupe treatment during the pregnancy as the withdrawal symptoms from discontinuation and/or dose fluctuation would be more harmful on the fetus than the medication itself.

###When to induce bupe; Precipitated Withdrawals; How to best induce

-Buprenorphine needs to be induced when a person is already in moderate to severe withdrawal. There is no set amount of time after your last opioid dose that you must wait, as it really relies on your symptoms, but waiting at least 24 hours is a pretty standard and safe way to go. However, you should use the COWS scale to rank your withdrawal symptoms when determining the right time to begin induction.

-If you induce bupe too soon, you can very likely experience precipitated withdrawals (PWDs). This occurs when you still have full agonist opioids on your receptors, take your bupe too soon, which then rips the full agonist off very uncomfortably and throws you into a horrible, magnified withdrawal that is worse than typical WD and can last hours. 

**NOTE: it is a common myth that the naloxone in suboxone is what causes PWD, and also that under that notion subutex will not cause PWD. THIS IS INCORRECT!!  PWD is caused by buprenorphine, not the naloxone! Bupe has a higher binding affinity than naloxone. Also, the naloxone is only added as  an IV abuse deterrent... the nalox has a very low BA sublingually (around 2%) and is essentially inactive, but it does have more effect and impact via IV.**

-To induce bupe once you've determined you're ready and safe to do so, while many doctors (who drastically overprescribe) tell you to take an entire 8mg as your first dose... in my extended experience and extensive research over the years, i've found that it's best to begin with a small amount and work your way up higher as needed. A good start would be taking 1-2mg, waiting an hour to gauge how you feel before adding on, and then if your symptoms still have not subsided induce another 1-2mg every hour until you are reasonably comfortable. Its common to begin your sub use on higher doses such as 8-16mg; however it is often unnecessary to go that high and its better to get by on as low of a dose as you can stabilize on.


**The Bernese Method of Induction**

For those that struggle to wait the 24+ hour period of sickness before they can take sub, there is a method available that if done right will make the transition much smoother, called the Bernese Method.

This method is the use of bupe alongside your full agonist opiate for a short period, taking the bupe in micro amounts that gradually increase while your dose of full agonist gradually decreases. What this does is allows bupe to start binding to your receptors and creating a buildup, but due to the low amount and the full agonist taken on top of it you wont experience PWD while this happens. As your system begins to have bupe built up on your receptors, it makes dropping off your full agonist and all the way onto a higher dose of the bupe essentially painless.

An example of how this is done: In this example we're looking at a 5 day schedule, with bupe increasing in very small amounts while your full agonist will decrease by 20% each day. For this example lets assume your habit is 1gram of heroin per day. Here is how you could use the Bernese Method to induce bupe:

*Starting point: 1g dope, 0mg bupe

*Day 1: 0.125mg bupe, then 0.8g dope

*Day 2: 0.25mg bupe, then 0.6g dope

*Day 3: 0.5mg bupe, then 0.4g dope

*Day 4: 0.75mg bupe, then 0.2g dope

*Day 5: 1mg bupe, 0 dope. Now that you've dropped your full agonist, you can begin increasing your bupe using the same method described above for regular induction, until you reach a dose you can stabilize on.

###Getting on bupe: cost; how to obtain a prescription

**How to get a prescription:** you can use suboxone.com to browse for doctors in your area, or google ""suboxone doctors in my area"" or something of the sort. also, if you have insurance you can call your provider and ask for doctors that accept your plan that way. Once you've found a doctor, you'll go in for an intake. Expect a UA at this, and every visit. You must fail for opiates or buprenorphine generally in order to be scripted on your intake appointment. As long as you go to your intake, drop a dirty UA, and pay - you should be walking out the door that day with your script. Some places will make you go weekly or biweekly at first or if you come in with dirty UAs. Some places will script you a month at a time as long as you pass your UA. It varies a little bit for each person, but many times you will start out scripted 8-16mg a day.

**Cost:** This varies quite a bit, based on whether or not you have insurance and on your location. Many places will still charge a cash copay too even if you do have insurance coverage, but your script should be mostly (if not fully) covered by the insurance.

Typically an intake visit runs from around 200-350$, and then goes down in future visits to a lesser amount ranging from around 100-200$.

Without insurance, you can get the generic bupe tablets for like $3ea with coupon that is available online.

**Bonus- street cost**: Some of us cannot afford to obtain a script the legitimate way, or just cant have access for whatever reason. But good thing thanks to overprescribing, the streets are flooded with subs in many areas. The price varies state to state, going from $10ea at minimum to $25ea at maximum. $15 or so could be considered the average, and if you choose the Dark Web route the average cost is generally ~$15ea-$20ea. (these prices are all based on 8mg doses, which is the most commonly scripted strip/pill and is most commonly found on the black market)

###Getting off bupe: Disproving horror stories; Proper Tapering; How to approach a proper taper

*Getting off bupe can be difficult, but it does NOT at all have to be what people make it out to be. If you do it the right way!*

**Disputing horror stories:** People often say how horrible it is to come off subs, how its worse than dope, how its not worth it to go on them at all due to the detox, that its hell etc. However, its very likely that 95% of these people did not do a proper taper. They either jumped too high, tapered too fast, or didnt taper at all and cold turkeyed it. If you do any of those things, you will have a horror story.

**Properly Tapering:** Tapering off subs can be a process that takes a bit of time, patience, and committment. Its common for the taper process to take weeks or months.  The specifics that will make up your  best available taper will vary from person to person - depending mostly on your daily dosage, how long you've been taking it, and your the supply/amount you have available to work with. 

**How to approach a proper taper**: Of course doing this under the guidance and supervision of a medical professional is the ideal way to go. But if you are  going to/have to taper off on your own, there are helpful resources available that can point you in the right direction. [Here](http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.com/taper) is a very informative website that can be extremely helpful for those looking to taper, and it even offers a suggested taper schedule calculator based on your current stable dose. 

*I (u/chasingd0pamine) also write custom tapers for fellow redditors, that i carefully put together using the details of your specific situation and customize for each individual person. Note, once again I am not a doctor myself but have extensive knowledge/experience of buprenorphine, its pharmacology, and the proper procedures involved in getting on/off the drug - and have put together probably between 30-40 tapers for people. These tapers i write are merely suggestions - not medical advice - and i simply offer this service as an additional option for those coming off bupe to try out.*


###Routes of Administration (ROAs) & their Bioavailabilities

*The prescribed way to take it is sublingually - dissolved under the tongue. but there are other ways, which do have higher bioavailabilities. I am not suggesting anyone abuse their meds, but if you can cut your dose by using another ROA you can cut your cost and make this more affordable. However a warning: once you switch your ROA from sublingual use to another form of ingestion, it can be very difficult to break that habit and go back to sublingual dosing in the future*

Sublingual: 30%

Intranasal: 45%

Rectal: 54%

IV: 100%

###Breaking through bupe/using after bupe; recreational value

**Attempting breakthrough:** It is extremely dangerous to try and break through your dose to get high. If you are going to use, it really depends on your bupe dose but youll typically need to wait 24-48 hours in order to get high. sometimes more if you are on a high dose of sub and have been on it for a while. 

**Recreational Value:** Bupe can have a recreational value to some users, but really just to those who have a very low tolerance. Remember that less is more when taking it to get high, and that it is very potent and sometimes makes people sick when they are trying to get high off it. 

##Suboxone Maintenance: benefits; clean vs not

-Benefits: Choosing bupe is not for everyone, but it saves many lives. It is great for chronic relapsers, for those who need a stepping stone while rebuilding their lives and working recovery, for those who have pain and are also an addict, etc.

-Clean or not?: This question gets asked a lot here and there is no right answer for it. Suboxone can greatly assist in working your recovery, making personal progress, rebuilding your life, getting off dope when nothing else seems to stop you, saving your life, and so on. To those that are in NA and/or are fully abstinent from all opiates and drugs, then no they wont consider you clean. But if you are clean from your opiate abuse, from full agonists, from your addiction, and are using it as intended then that can be considered clean too.",8

I've been using it for five months to try and kick an eleven year oxycodone habit.  I've never come off suboxone before so i don't know what to expect.  It's day 2 and it feels bad, but not horrible.  I tried to taper but if i have them, I'll take them, so i made the decision to quit. I've done this more times than i can count but this time is different.  A lot of people in my life found out and this is my last chance to quit and preserve the relationships I've damaged so much.  The pressure of knowing ""this has to be it"" is scary.  My husband is supportive, but i broke his trust and confidence in me.  I've read suboxone withdrawal can be longer than other opiates which makes me nervous.  I've been clean for months at a time, and  usually relapse 5-8 months out.  But I need to shake this demon once and for all.  I want to maintain some semblance of self respect.  I don't want to feel the familiar deep depression and fear when I begin to go into withdrawal.  I'm losing myself to this.  I need to get rid of this voice in my head that says, ""what makes you think you can do it this time""?",2
2019-10-30 13:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/dp9y4b/advice_on_jumping/,Advice on jumping,"Hi, i had a pretty bad fentanyl habit and after a couple od's I decided enough was enough I stopped cold turkey from about a gram a day(dont know the actual amount of fentanyl) for about a week I couldn't move but the physical symptoms got better, although the real wd was just starting. I went clean for about a month. My family saw very clearly how bad my paws were and they along with a doctor convinced me to go on suboxon for the fear of relapse. I must say this is the worst decision I made. I started off at 8mg with basically no tolerance and being a addict I didnt complain, i was getting very high and for free as well off the suboxone. 

Cut to about 8 months later I am on my third day of .5 mg. The only wd i ever felt was the jump from 2 to 1 mg and that was only some insomnia and some nasua in the morning. So far I am 3 days into .5 mg and I feel perfectly fine have not noticed any change. I would go as far as to say I feel better mentally, happier. One part I left out was for the suboxone treatment I came back home to where I was originally from, to minimize risk of relapse. This was my families idea and they agreed to send me money for anything I needed to help me get through this. They have been extremely supportive. But I just had enough of laying around all day and I needed to go back to Canada and resume my life so after my last visit with the doc and he gave me the prescription for .5mg for 2 weeks i booked a ticket back to canada. Now looking at it I have enough suboxone for 2 weeks for .5mg a day and I dont if he'll give me another script. I have a appointment with him 2 days before my flight. So my question is really what can I expect jumping of at .5mg and what advice would you guys give me to make the jump easier. I was thinking of going down to .25mg in a week and then staying in that for a week, then taking the remainder with me and just taking  .25 when I really need it. Im gonna back to work as soon as I get back to help take my mind of any wd.",1

They promised me that I will not be given a script of suboxone (I refuse to go on something else as I just want this shit over with) and they said that the drugs would be out of my system completely, only that it would be up to me afterward to continue on with my treatment therapy wise, which I have set up.

&#x200B;

I will be staying for 7 days...any stories of your own medical detox would be a life saver. I am so scared. I feel like such a fuck up I can barely stand to look at myself.",5

This cold is also making the ickness way worse. Runny burning eyes, nose,  shivers, but hey at least it’s a reminder to not do something stupid, as I’m sure I’m sick because of snorting crap. I got the day off, so I’ll probably only go out in public once to run my errands, I have some kratom, which I will allow myself to use during the first 4 days. So that should prop me up enough to feel human for a short stretch anyways. Hope everyone is making progress, big or small, it all counts.",2

I’d love someone to let me know roughly what to expect and how to deal with symptoms maybe? I have to stay functional for work, I can always blame it on “the flu” or whatever.

I had the resources to do so as as subsidiary company of Gilead Pharmacies made a generic that costs $24k vs $26,400 for Harvoni by AbbieV, and 75k thru other companies for Epclusa, 84k for Mayret, and Harvoni being 93k for those without Medicaid which I do not qualify for and only SOME private insurances cover it, and mine does not. 24k is still a FUCK ton of money but it's a small price to pay to be cured for life as I have not shared a needle with anyone in 46 and a half months now and have not been exposed since 2013 and I know exactly who the exposure was from. 

I had gotten extensive blood work done since October of 2013 but when symptoms arose 76 days ago, I knew something was up but being the procrastinator I am, I waited another 36 days to get a blood test done. 

Does anyone have any experience with the extreme fatigue regarding this medication? 

One of 2 things happen daily to me:

I'll fall asleep literally standing or sitting up for 3-5 hours at a time for 3-4x a day or I'll fall asleep from ANYWHERE from 16 hours to 42 hours at the max when I lay my head down to sleep. I just slept 34 hours like a rock. Luckily my German Shepherd knows how to open the door upon standing up and with her paw, can open the door to go to the bathroom and I always fill up 3 water bowls at least a liter apiece with 1-2 days worth of food and she eats at a slow pace because they're naturally slim. Again back to the original question: When does the extreme fatigue go away for anyone thats taken this medication? My doctor said 7 weeks. Online it says 2 weeks until your last dose. I have known 6 people to take this medication and for some, it was gone at week 6-8, for others their last dose. What about anyone in this community?

3/4 symptoms are gone/going away as my doctor gave me 5 supplements to take daily with this.

The drug induced anorexia/weight loss going from 182 to 138 in a span of 76 days is gone due to the supplements.
The weakness is starting to go away.
The Jaundice that began very little has gone away.

You really can’t heal in the original place you got sick...,"I saw that quote today and it really resonated with me. I was living with 2 extremely disgusting roommates. 1 was my “ex” best friend, and the other was his clueless girlfriend. After 6.5 years clean I got divorced and moved back in with my old buddy that it had all started with. Bad idea on my part, but to be fair he said he was clean for 3 years... so I thought hell this could be great! Boy was I wrong, within 6 months I found out he wasn’t clean at all, the most he had been clean was a week. So my dumbass was jealous, and for some reason my mind didn’t even think about the consequences, or even the pain I went through years ago getting off Oxy80’s... I was complacent. And that’s what led me down the path that everyone says is going to happen and everyone else tells themselves, “I have more self control than that”, “there’s no way I’d steal from my family!” “ I would never sell my most prized possessions” and then next thing you know, you’ve done all that. It’s a very slippery slope. I literally told me self I’d NEVER do H. It’s nasty! I’m not gonna stoop that low! That shits for junkies and I’m not a junkie! You can keep telling yourself these things, but in reality you’re either in denial, or you’ll for sure end up down this path, or jail, or death if it gets to you first. You really think all these other people that say the EXACT same shit as me didn’t think the same things before we got deep into this hell hole? We all said the same shit and look where we all are now. You have to get rid of everything and I fucking mean EVERYTHING that led you here. 

Basically I went from 80’s in 2010/2011 to 30’s in 2017 and then to bth probably around the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018. Eventually the same thing happens to everyone:
1.like me, my connect moved hella far away, had to find someone else and that person only had tar. 
2. Your tolerance goes up and now you’re at 60$ a day JUST for 2 blues, which wasn’t even enough for me.
3.You realize that bth is stronger, cheaper, and lasts longer, but you could also get stuff that’s bad/fire it’s not like prescription pills where it’s a guaranteed analysis. Every batch you get is usually different. 
4. Luckily for me I didn’t get this far but I guarantee I would have shot up at some point. Because now you realize, you need EVEN LESS AND you get HIGHER. But now your chances of ODing have significantly increased. 

This shit really is the devil and it WILL lead you down this path of the worst shit ever. The daily struggle of having to find some before you even want to say hello to the world. If you thought cigarettes had a grip on you... fuck this shit has you by the neck pulling you every fucking day. 

This is what I did and I hope it can help someone. I literally had to move away from the sickness. You really can’t heal in the place you got sick in the first place! Sure your buddy is going to tell you he has your back. But guess what. When you are struggling the WORST on day 3/4 he will also be there to “get your back” I promise you that. And if you are both sober, you’ll just come up with some just reason on why you can do it once just to feel ok and then maybe the WDs won’t be so bad? I can take just one hit! BULLSHIT,
You gotta get out of there. You need to be a in a place where there are sober people to support you. Or at least get away to a place you can be alone away from the drugs and then call or talk to your support group however and whenever you need to. You HAVE to get rid of every single person on your phone you have ever bought drugs from. Period. I went and blocked all numbers, then deleted them. Same thing on all social media platforms. I promise you , that you will get tempted on the worst days, it’s the devil in your brain trying to submit reason into your brain of why you NEED this. But you have to fight it. And by getting rid of the people you use to call when you were tempted we are now changing our behavior into calling someone who will just listen to what we have to say or help us by telling us what we need to hear. You have to change old behaviors. This is a great first step. Every time I want to use, I either call someone, or I post on here and get shit off my chest. Not only does it help me, but writing this could potentially save someone’s life. Now that you did that, the only way you’re going to use is by physically getting up and going out to a new part of town(since you got away from the place you originally got sick) but we both know that on day 3/4 that’s the last thing we wanna do is get out of fucking bed and go sit somewhere and just HOPE you don’t get robbed or worse. At that point is it really even worth it? You let almost past the WORST of it by then, literally on day 5 I could physically see my symptoms alleviating. It was a huge boost in my motivation that I really needed. It showed me that it DOES get better. It’s only a few days of absolute hell and then some days after that, that are tolerable but not back to normal yet. Besides that I really really wanted this. And I think that’s a huge part of why they say only 1% get better. A lot of the time we get forced into recovery and even for me, I was in inpatient for 9 months and went through drug court. But this time I quit because I wanted to. I did it CT by myself. On day 3 when I was struggling the most is when I came out and told my GF who had no idea, my buddy who was 9 months clean at the time and now my sponsor, and my dad. The reason I told my dad was because he was sending me money when I was broke, I was using him. And I knew that if I wanted to use I could text him, get some cash and be good. So I told him everything and to not send me cash anymore. You have to do everything you can think of to stop yourself because the mind is a fucking powerful tool that is easily manipulated. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOURE SOOOO DOPE SICK!! 

Last but not least this is what I used for the WDs:
-Imodium for your stomach 
-I had 1 tramadol from a long time ago that I split in half and used a half for the worst nights. Didn’t really help me sleep tbh, just extra tired.
-1 last dose of red Bali kratom I took after 24 hours off tar. I think it was 7-8g
-and edibles. This is the only thing that helped me sleep and took away minor pain. 1-100mg drink was enough to make me sleep 5-6 hours a night from day 6-12

Good luck everyone on this journey. I know you can do it just really want it. I’m serious, if you aren’t 100% ready, you will be weak minded and give yourself excuses, don’t let it happen, you can do this! I’d love to help as many people as I can, so if you are struggling and don’t want to comment on here please message me. I’m pretty openly available and should respond very quickly.

What solvent would he best? Polypropylene glycol or alcohol? Assuming water won't be any good but am researching atm. Have PG ready so would rather use that.

How much loperamide per ml of solvent? There is fillers in the capsules so that will probably need to be accounted for. I haven't found any info for the solubility yet but assume 1mg/ml should be fine.

Dosing and taper schedule? I am thinking of starting at 1mg and hoping to dose every other day but have no idea when or how much to drop by for the taper.

If anyone knows anywhere else I could ask these questions or has any experience with this please pet me know.

Edit: After putting 2mg into 2ml of propylene glycol the solution looks a little cloudy after 15 minutes and there's sediment settling at the bottom. The Lope should be dissolved right? If I siphone off the liquid it should be fine to assume that there's 2mg of lope to 2ml of pg?",1

Tried heroine and the fent presses and would binge those sometimes but oxy was always my favorite. Anyways, once I left college and got a job and had rent, bills, all that good stuff on my own for the first time I just couldn’t afford it anymore so I found Suboxone and have been on that for probably 6-7 months but I’m just tired of the endless cycle of having to rely on a substance to keep me normal. Been scrolling through reddit all day looking at stories of quitting subs, some reallyyyy brutal even months down the line and some rather inspiring after only a couple weeks. I figured I would post partly to vent about how bad this shit is cause nobody in my life really seems to understand. I’m on day 3 right now and fuck it sucks. Chills, sweats, fatigue, but fuck the depression is what is kicking my ass the most. So that’s what I got going on and would love some responses, tips, or whatever just so I have an outlet to look at before I go buy some oxy and feed the demon. Thanks for reading guys.",2

This Sub helped a lot!,"It’s 6 months, today, since I took my last oxy pill (or coke etc) and started on suboxone.

THANK YOU!!
Honestly, without the information and answers I got from this sub, I would have never made the leap and stuck with it!!  
I’ll still be on suboxone for awhile - but I’m okay with that for now.  I’m so glad to have 6 months without all the messed up shit that pills had me doing.  I could buy myself clothes and makeup today because I haven’t spent every last cent on drugs (not to mention not having to borrow money and wreak havoc on other people’s lives!!)
I’m not sure I have any amazing answers - but if anyone has any questions or is just starting out, feel free to reply or message me.",2

Waking up feeling like death, want to hit up my dealer and just get one day of relief and a decent night of sleep. Haven’t used dope in over two years and my brain is tryna justify that it’s buprenorphine my body is addicted to and I can get away with smoking H","I know that’s my brain playing tricks on me.   What it’s telling me is “one day of smoking h will not have any withdrawals bc you are addicted To/kicking buprenorphine, so session of H and a good night of sleep will give you the strength to continue going.   I have a tingling sensation in my right arm (feels like a nerve that starts in my fingers and is inside my arm all the way to my brachial artery) that gets so itchy and uncomfortable and I wanna smash my hand with a hammer or punch a wall in order to get rid of that discomfort.     


I have heard of people using h their first few days of getting off subs so that when the WD from the dope goes away (after a few days), the sub withdrawal (which is 4-5x longer) won’t seem as bad.   

Not going to hit up one of several dboys.   Even have an old homie that recently offered to split a gram with me if I just drive him 15 min to and from his dboy.  All fire 🔥 bth.    But I turned him down twice.   
*Smoking Weed completely helps me to almost forget I was craving bth*

Wake up at 3am after 2-5 of of heavily interrupted sleep.   Once I feel like ima scream bc of the chills and punch a hole in my wall, I go straight downstairs. Brew 5g tea of Coastline Kratom (which feels impossible to make at first) I brew for 15 min and I pop 4mg of alprazolam.  Drink 5G tea within an hour and then notice I am able to somewhat pay attention to what’s on TV and I stop sweating profusely.   Smoke my morning doobie for a wake and bake.  Im good for about 4-5 hours. Then I make a 2-3 more 5G teas throughout the day.     

Will I notice sub withdrawals dissipate as long as I’m taking kratom or am I postponing the inevitable and should just endure the worst with no Kratom.  The kratom and weed and bars definitely stopped me from picking up black many times.",1

I had been working steady the last 3 years, just started a union job and was bartending on the weekends.  Finally bought a car I enjoyed.  I am in really great shape and the gym is a must for me.  The last year or so I’d even started dating more and more and was enjoying quite a bit of success in that realm.  

When they removed the breathing tube and my vocal chords healed some enough to talk I had no immediate answer as to why?  Was it just a stressful day? Was I truly not happy ?  I seem to just find life just unbearable sometimes.  I really wish that I could just go to work everyday and think like a normal person.  I see people with much less so much more grateful.

We live across the country from each other (1400 miles), and over the course of the past couple months, it's become apparent to me that he's using again. He hasn't come out and told me, but he's back in his old habits of 1AM slurred phone calls, rambling about the world being out to get him. He is only 20-40 miles from mom/dad/brother/sister.  I have a fairly close relationship with his family, but I'm struggling with telling them because it doesn't feel right from so far away. Am I wrong here? I would appreciate any and all insights. This is my first time dealing with something like this with someone who is so close to me.

There's now none in the house for me to take and surprise surprise,  I'm a couple of months off and doing ok ( not amazing but good).    
Just losing the supply forced me to come off.  I did find a few tabs the other day and took them but they ran out within a day or so.  So overall it seems pretty obvious now that these things need to not be within reach and you have no other option but to come off.

My question is after I’m down to just 2.5mg a day how bad will the WD be when I finally stop? Oh, and I’ve heard nothing but bad stuff about kratom so I don’t really wanna do that either. I just want my normal life back from 4 months ago before I was dumb and started using.

Thank you for your time and input!",2

I’m volunteering for a local harm reduction program to give back to the community I was once a part of and have an actual job interview with them on Friday. This last year and half has been hellish at points but I’m proud I’ve made it this far. I used for 10 years and got up to 2 gs of fentadope a day in the end. I couldn’t imagine being 1.5 years clean then. I can confidently say Suboxone/Subutex saved my life this time around so I am a huge proponent of that form of medically assisted treatment.

Week after that small relapse, I was clean again and studied abroad in London. (IF YOU CAN TRAVEL, DO IT. YOU NEED A CHANGE OF PERSPECTIVE IN RECOVERY)
After London I got back on the shot and haven’t looked back since. Don’t know when I plan on stopping to take it, and don’t plan on it anytime soon until I fully trust myself.

Could do with some advice on how to go about kicking a mild addiction to codeine.

Neither would be doing my health any good and I've had enough of spending upwards of 100 quid every month or so on pills.

  my last post, I tapered to .25 on day 4, skipped day 5, .25 day 6 and none today.   
On my days off, I can feel the WD beginning and I take some Kratom to ease the pain and one 2mg alprazolam.  Along with some pristine marijuana.   

I only have one .25mg piece left.   I could easily go get more and extend this taper, but I need you all to answer a few questions for me as best as you can:

Will taking .25mg tomorrow and then jumping off after that have any sort of benefit compared to just jumping off today?   Is the only difference of extending the taper and getting it as close to 0 as possible to ease the symptoms.   If jumping off now is going to be worse but means I’ll get my life back sooner, I want to do it now.  I took off time from work.  I have 3 weeks to become as normal as possible.  I workout 5-6x a week regardless of my WD (sometimes I’m just throwing up and rehydrating every twenty minutes) and sauna it up, but I can feel the endorphin high and opiates being repaired in my body.  I want to be free of this now.  Am I stupid to make the jump today?   

Despite Suboxone’s insane grasp on me now, it did help me get my life back on track over the last two years.   I have a future I’m finally hopeful about  and have graduated and acquired all certifications to begin working ASAP.  But I need to be free of suboxone before I can begin my new career.

I was thinking of a metaphor to describe my addiction to someone who doesnt understand. This is more accurate than i would care to admit and have not told anyone this is how i see it.

Not sure if anyone will even read this. I go on this sub to read sometimes but i dont know how active it is.

For me my addiction(drug use) was a big bandaid covering the horrible wound of my meantal health. From the outside it looked ok. You can see there was something wrong, hence the bandaid, but you couldnt see the much worse wound underneath. I didnt talk about it, and stopped looking at it for so long i almost forgot about it myself. It worked for a while. But it came tome to take that bandaid off. Now i just have this open wound. I keep trying to fix it by poking and prodding, medicine, creams, whatever the metaphor needs. All that messing around is  only making it worse. Its infected now and i dont know how to fix it. ""Well hey youre on the right path, youre putting in the work"". Well to me the wound is only getting worse everday. I try to cover it up to other people but i know its there. Im more depressed than i ever have been before. I keep thinking how easy it would be to put that bandaid back on so i dont have to constantly see it and think about it. I wont have to constantly try to fix it and mend it. Sure the infection will kill me eventually but at least i wont spend the last days staring at an infected gaping wound trying hopelessly to fix it. The only reason i dont is i hope that one day ill finally find the cure for it. The infection will clear up and the wound will slowly heal. There will be a bad scar with a great story. I dont see any cure though. It was so much easier with the bandaid.",7

Never posted over here but I’ve posted in r/opiates on several occasions. 

I’m in a dark place. The darkest place I’ve ever been. I have had a semi regular habit on blues for a few months and the last two weeks it’s gotten out of control. I haven’t used since Thursday but the depression is killing me at this point.

How do I survive? I feel like the physical symptoms have abated because my usage was not long term. Just since August 1. But holy fuck this depression may be the end of me. I know my brain is all fucked up and needs time to heal but I just don’t know if I can give it the time it needs. I’ve seen people say it takes years to normalize. I can’t imagine that pain of being in the same mental state a year from now.

I have no appetite, low sex drive and sexual stamina, low motivation, and almost anything can make me cry right now. 

How long am I in for this? I’m ready 100% to be done and get right. I haven’t felt genuine happiness in a while and I’m just now realizing that. I didn’t think I had a problem but I was lying to myself. 

I know that I did this to myself and I made these choices. It seemed harmless at first but eventually became more regular and now I feel like I’ve ruined my future and I don’t know if I can make it through this. 

I just need someone to talk to. Someone to help me see that it gets better.",1

I took a very small piece of a 4mg oral strip. Like 1/4-1/8 of an inch in size. I now have a bad headache from it, extremely red eyes, tore up stomach, and am at the borderline of having a major panic attack. I threw the rest of the pack away because I don’t want to feel this way again. 

How long does this take to go away? My friend who’s more experienced on subs said he felt similar, but he also told me that subs caused him to sleep many hours the day after he took it, so he’d have days where he took one and then sleep most the next day, and then take one again. I only bring that up bc I just took 5mg of Ambien and 1mg of Klonopin an hour ago. I took the strip piece about 6 hours ago. 

Btw, I was tricked in to taking this med. My friend said it would give me energy and make me feel good (I had been depressed lately), and I didn’t know what it was until later on when I googled the packet it came in.

Thanks for any help you can provide.",1

Tbh I kind of hate being off on the weekend but oh well it's nice to get two days off. I was super stressed and anxious yesterday when I commented on the check in. It was my 6 month clean date.. It's really crazy to think about how much my life has changed in just half a year. I think the last time my life changed so much in such a short time was when I was 13/14 and got into the punk scene in my home city.  

In that way this really seems like chapter 2 of my life. I don't believe in fate or destiny but in a weird way it does seem like everything that's happened in my life has set me up for being able to be resilient, self reliant and successful. All the energy I used to put into the punk scene and then of course drugs I am now channeling into school, my job, and eventually my actual ~career~.  

This cooler weather has definitely been giving me a few weird intrusive thoughts here and there, I think I mentioned this yesterday too. Just because I've come a ways and had some victories doesn't mean I don't still have to stay vigilant. I alwaysthink of that meme/comic with the character like reaching out to something and then this big blob behind him taps him on the shoulder and he goes back to it.. Probably a bad description but if anyone knows the meme I'm talkin about link it pls? Cuz it's exactly how addiction feels, that blob thing is a few yards behind me now instead of lurking right over my shoulder, and I can easily ignore the occasional taps, but that doesn't mean it can't take a few steps towards me and envelop me again.  

Therapy has been really helpfulfor me lately as this is the first time in my life I've really kept my emotions and issues to myself to the point where it's become a problem. I used to have the opposite issue so it's kind of ironic. It's funny that when I first started seeing my therapist just over a year ago, when I attempted to get clean but had no desire to do so, I really didn't like her, but now I genuinely look forward to seeing her every week and like her as both a therapist and a person.  

I definitely am inclined to talk about any other issue in my life before I talk about my abusive exes or my parents abusive behavior when I was a child, and I'm not one to shy away from my issues, but that shit is tough for me to process- I've blocked a lot of it out and I also still believe that it was my fault. I didn't necessarily deserve it, but it was my fault for putting myself in those situations. And I know that my whole mindset surrounding the abuse I went through is directly correlated to my issues with addiction, I even exhibit the exact same self destructive behaviors in both situations, so even though it's extremely uncomfortable it's necessary to do in order to conquer both my dependency and addiction issues.  

I do feel like I'm getting stronger though. Just being able to deal with the stresses in my life 100% by mydelf is a pretty big victory. I used to be terrified of being alone, now I look forward to it. But I still gotta get over my sense of worth being enmeshed with my partners presence in my life and opinion of me. That shit is unhealthy and plays out in one's brain almost exactly the same as drug addiction. Dragging oneself through hell for the couple of minutes of heaven. R is not abusive to me and our relationship is overall pretty healthy, but these issues we've been having as of late have jyst been prompting me to rethink the way I approach certain situations. I have to get better at putting myself first. Which is ironic cuz usually addicts' issues are the opposite, and I'm sure I'm faulty in that aspect in certain ways, but there is definitely a balance to be reached that I have yet to achieve.  

Well,  let me wrap my traditional thesis-style check in up lmao. How is everyone doing? Anyone have any fun plans for the weekend? For anyone who's in those first few days or weeks, what is a specific goal that you would like to achieve now that you are clean, and what are some of the steps that you're planning on taking to complete that goal? It's amazing how fast life improves when we take that junkie ingenuity and hustle and drive and apply it to the areas in life that really matter. If you're still in the weeds and feeling hopeless, remind yourself that it'll pass, even if it feels like eternity, and you are doing one of the hardest fucking things in the world and *you are succeeding at it*. You got this. We all got this. Love you guys and enjoy y'all weekends! 💜",6

I'm hoping I can share some encouragement that might help anyone thinking about detoxing or who's in the middle of it. Because I promise you that if I could survive the last 5 months, you can survive a week or two of detox!

This year I decided to come off a decade using high dose painkillers. Only 2 other people knew I was addicted during that time. Lived a successful life, great family and career, etc. I started using for a series of spinal injuries and ended up becoming addicted due to a series of emotional traumas. It was like a perfect storm. The pills gave me superpowers. I was able to  push my needs aside and focus on everything else that mattered. I knew I was addicted, but didn't think of myself as an addict. At that point I had been in episodic -- but not daily -- pain for years. My biggest fears were withdrawals and what would happen the next time I was in a pain flare-up. That kept me using for many years. I didn't think I was strong enough. 

The first week went as planned. No sleep, awful RLS, chills, anxiety, pain, etc.  I found NA on the 3rd night. I was desperate for anything to help get through another sleepless night without using. This sub was amazing. I got some good tough love here when I asked about using some of the ""emergency doses"" I'd kept handy.

Then on the 7th day everything changed. I had only slept a couple hours total in that first week and was pushing myself so hard -- doing yoga each morning, walking 1-2 miles daily, making healthy meals, etc. I just wanted to purge everything from my body as quickly as possible. but because I'm an addict I pushed way too hard! I injured myself in a yoga and ended up in urgent care by the next night.So here was the first flareup I dreaded - which had kept me using for years. My pain level was between a 6-9 day in day out, usually on the highest end. I tried to embrace it as a great test for my resolve...if I could get through a week or two in extreme pain then I was for sure serious about quitting!

But the pain never left. And it impacted every single area of my life - couldn't sit in chairs, walk, bend, lift, etc. Which means I suddenly couldn't clean, cook, work, exercise, anything. During detox I remember wondering how anyone in a wheelchair or severely disabled could ever get clean because exercising was like medicine! Now I here I was.

I tried acupuncture, chiropractors, massage. Nothing helped but somehow I didn't take anything. 1 month in I got an epidural which also didn't help. 2  months in I got admitted to a chronic pain FRP (Functional Restoration Program), which is basically ""body rehab"" for 4 hrs each day, over 8 weeks. Didn't help, but somehow insanely I still haven't taken anything.

Sometimes it seems impossible to me that I've lived in this amount of pain for 5 months. No pink cloud yet, no life is so much better. The truth is life is hard and painful and some days I don't know how I'll get through. I still spend my days on ice packs, turning from one side to another and trying to push through. I eventually might have some tough choices to make down the road about the future. This level of pain may be what was underneath the painkillers or it might decrease as my brain heals. No clue yet. But no matter what I now have a beautiful support group with my NA family, and I am trusting that given the right conditions our bodies and brains can heal.

So for anyone out there who thinks they can't push through a few shitty days or weeks, dude if I could do THIS for 153 days straight, you so have withdrawals. I am not tough or hardcore or anything. And somehow I'm doing it one day at a time. You've got this!

And if anyone out there is living in chronic pain and has some words of encouragement, I'm all ears.",61

I really don't want to get locked up abroad. I know there are TONS of rehab resorts here, but I don't have the money for that.
I know about kratom. I've tried it before when I was in the states and it was such a bad mistake. I will spare you the details of what happened with my bodily functions. I ended up going to the ER because I was so dehydrated. I was honest with the doc there and he said I'm either allergic to it, or there was something in it other than kratom. 
Any advice is much appreciated.

My counselor said she might be able to get me in tomorrow, but all I can think about is how I have almost 3 days before my next urine test which is plenty of time for fent to get out of my system if I did it one more day.

I thought if I buy another 400mg and mix it with alot of liquid it would be easier to stick to a tapering schedule if i had to drink over 2 litres of liquid for a dose. It seems like if I have just 75mg it relieves negative effects.

Not sure if this will just delay the inevitable or legitimately make things easier and decrease the risk of me relapsing again. Anyone got an opinion on this line of thinking?",3

It’s moderate symptoms, but it’s just so annoying. It feels like my body is broken. I wish there was something I could take to stop it (apart from opiates). Off topic, but I have experienced panic attacks while I used, and it has scarred me, I have mild PTSD from it. Every time I think of it I get the worse impending feeling of doom, a feeling I’ve never felt before. The main reason I stopped using was because of how traumatic my panic attacks got. I know time will heal this mental wound.

I just can’t  deal with the RLS; and feeling like I’m broken. Can anyone relate ? Does it get better with time?

2019-10-15 22:42:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/diivt3/tips_on_quitting_when_youre_ready/,"Tips on quitting, when you’re ready","I’m not going to fire up my backstory, I’ll keep it short and say there was a bundle to 2ga day, several relapses and even a MAT once. No needles, I think a higher being gave me that phobia for a reason, I still have a hard time with blood tests @ 30yo. 

Anyway, I’m going to tell you some things that I did, that led to my most successful recovery. 

I went CT with helper meds. Had about 10mg xan/etiz, limited on purpose. Clonadine, Kava, loperamide (dosed by instructions on box), some herbal BS from the store for sleep & anxiety(minor help if any) for the 1st week. I used Kratom in a dose high enough to help WD for days 3-6 because I needed a break, but taking the 50-90g a day made my body so ill I had to stop and get back to the semiacute wds without it. 
Save your benzos for bedtime, you’ll need them.  Shake it out during the day. Drink plant based protein mix and as much water and you can hold if foods not easy. Oh, and tremendous help to THC as well as CBD. after the first few days of craziness, I was smoking weed 24/7 and taking CBD oil like it was candy. It really helps the mind slow down and the legs stop shaking for a little. After 7 days sleeping 0-1.5 hours every 24 hours, I introduced gabapentin & seroquel, at 300mg 2x a day and 50-75mg nightly. Yeah, these are all low doses for a reason, I’ll explain later. Introduced a healthy workout routine, changed some friend around, forced self care & healtier eating. Fasted 12 hours a day(not sure if it helped but some ppl say yes) I also added for the first time, a low daily dose of naltrexone. I stared with 1mg and moved up to about 3-4 a night. I think it really helped with my endorphin restoration. Gaba needs to be weened off by week 3-5 sooner the better trust me. I’ve always been an insomniac so I kept with the seroq but might seek alternatives. 


All that shit helped. But it was, and is still hard. I got clean plenty of times with subs or total excess prescription abuse to deal with the effects, before eventually just relapsing.  

I had to be ready to quit. It was taking my life from me, so I changed everything about me. I stopped taking shortcuts, I moved away from suppliers and enablers, I invested into myself and relationships, I gave back to people and I dealt with the pain because I knew I brought this upon myself. I don’t sit around and be a sea urchin when I get a hangover, because I know my dumb ass was the one that drank all night. So don’t let this long ass dope hangover ruin your week/month. Be radical, be different, live a life without the game taking up all your time. 

All this shit is brain chemicals, realize that when you’re at your worst. And remember, the first ten day are actually easier then the next 30-90. I’d rather have 2 weeks of acutes then deal with paws. But I know that RESPONSIBLE use of prescriptions that your psych will give you can allow you to make your changes easier. 


So here, cliff notes 

Day 1-8 zans, clonadine, loperamide, THC, CBD, vitimins and supplements. 

Day 8-30 lope, THC, CBD (weened back to just late PM smoke) gabapentin, serq, and LDN (low dose naltrexone) 

The longer you can wait out for meds, the better off you’ll be. Don’t touch the naltrexone until day 7. The first 3-4 days, I wouldn’t judge about a little extra spice for when you’re on fire but you really want to be on and off these meds ASAP because they’re all addictive, since you are in fact an addict. 


Be ready for it, if you’re gonna half ass recovery, you’re just setting up for failure cause trust me, they get harder every time.",10

We’re in the process of getting the loan cleared up but he’s been stealing from me and others.

Well good in terms of work and school, rough in terms of my personal life. My fiancee and I were really going thru it for a while. We've really been thru hell and back together, from him helping me escape my abusive ex, us living out of my car on the road for nearly a year with nowhere to go, him getting locked up, being insanely strung out and then getting clean, to now dealing with ""real  life"" stressful problems together. And this was far from the first time we've been through shit, but definitely the first time that it was this bad and neither of us had any desire to go use about it. Even with the prospect of us breaking up coming up, neither of us wanted to get high.  

I have this bad habit of getting embarrassed to write or talk about my life, or at least do so honestly, when the going gets tough. I gotta get over my pride and get better at that cuz it doesn't really help much of anything. I always feel better once I like get the situation out and down on (figurative) paper. Even now, I'm writing about this , but things between us have been going better these last few days. If it was still awful tbh idve prolly kept this to myself.  

Anyways. I didn't go to my first class today, which I'm really upset and feel guilty about, but I have wicked bad period cramps that are only mildly subsiding when I'm hunched over with a hot water pad on my abdomen. I've gotten pretty awful cramps nearly the whole time since I got my period nearly 15 years ago, and when I was younger I a. Didn't have as many responsibilities, and didn't care as much about missing a day or two for the ones I did have and b. Didn't at all mind going about my daily life while stoned, which made things easier seeing as weed is pretty much the only thing I've found that subsides my cramps substantially. But these days I only smoke before bed and I very much give a shit about missing even one day of obligations. So it's a little (okay a lot) more of a hindrance than it was as a teenager.  

 When my rag first came back after 2.5 years strung out and getting it maybe 3x during that period of time, I was super stoked that, while I still got noticeable cramps on day 1 usually lasting into day 2, they were right on the border of discomfort and pain, making it so it really wasn't bad enough that I couldn't just push through it and go about my day. But this is the first time I've gotten my rag since being clean that I've had cramps that have put me out like this. I'm fucking pissed cuz I thought they might ~finally~ be subsiding for good.  

I even texted my mom about it and she told me how she used to faint cuz her cramps were so painful (something that happened to me more than a few times as a teen) and that hormonal birth control (which she knows I can't use) and having kids were the only things that made it a little better for her. So fml, i guess I'm just stuck with it.  

 It just fucking irks me that I have to deal with this bullshit, especially going into a male dominated industry where taking even one day off every few months is looked upon as weak, especially if one mentioned it was due to menstrual symptoms. I'm very well aware that life is not fair at this point but sometimes theres things that I still get hung up on the unchangable unfairness of.  

Well, this is long as shit again, I gotta start posting every day like I used to so I'm not rambling quite as much on here 😩😂 I hope everyone's doing better than I am today, and a tiny high five to myself for not even thinking of getting high despite knowing it'd instantly alleviate the pain. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.  

 Oh, just one more thing, on Friday I'm going to hit 6 months dope free! To anyone who's just starting out on this journey to living a better life, to whom a month or even week seems like a goddamn eternity, let alone half a year, I will reiterate- I literally thought I would die before I got clean. I went 2.5 years with a needle in my arm with no more than a 2 week break, always on kratom or subs during those. At my worst points I was spending 80$ on a bundle of fent a day going all into my own arm. I truly believed that I would never escape that life. But somehow I did, and here I am a whole half a year later, working a job I enjoy, making not bad money, in school full time with a major im passionate about And actual productive ambitions for the first time in my life.  

 And in the interest of full disclosure of course I will mention that I am on suboxone and have been since kicking, 12mg, and it has been a great help although I do plan to start tapering down to 8mg in these next few months and within 4 years be off of it. After 8 years on and off of struggling, at age 25 I'm finally free of the demon that is heroin and my eyes have been opened to all the possibilities in this crazy, interesting world. The hard times are not over, they never are, but I'm never going to look to drugs as an answer again. 💜",6

My boss gave me a ride back to my car after the game. The second I got back to my car I really really started contemplating picking up. ~I could swing by ""Dan's"", I bet he'd sell me some. No... I dont want tar, I want fent. I could hit up that new guy, but it's kinda risky.~

Not sure why or how, but I made it home still sober. I just wanted to share this, I guess to hold myself accountable? Idk. I'm tired so I'm going to bed. Tomorrow morning will be 11 full days since I last used. I hope I will keep on keeping on.

PLEASE KEEP ME ACCOUNTABLE AND ASK QUESTIONS. LETS DO THIS PEOPLE","Started 8mg once in the morning, everyday for one month, 4mg once a day for 11 months, 2mg once a day for the last year.  Tapered to 1mg (2 weeks ago).  Currently (0.5mg) once in the morning 

Drop from 8mg to 4mg was easy.  Didn’t notice anything other than I had been wasting strips.

Drop from 4mg to 2mg was a bit noticeable but after a good month in the gym and time, I feel it became normal enough for me to proceed with my day

Drop from 2mg to 1mg was more difficult.  You don’t really notice a difference until the 3rd day and you will noticeably crave suboxone. Maybe some discomfort, but time helped.  

Drop from 1mg to 0.5mg was difficult.  Sometimes, I would take 1mg after 3-4 days of taking 0.5mg bc it was noticeably difficult. Staying on 0.5mg now no matter what.   3-6g Red Bali Kratom eliminates WD symptoms about 60-70%.  BOWEL MOVEMENTS WERE INSANE.  Maybe because of both the low dose suboxone was not blocking me up as much as it used to and the kratom.

2019-10-14 18:42:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/dhygae/trauma_is_the_real_gateway/,Trauma is the real gateway.,"Things like cannabis, caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.

Addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. 

I think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.

TRAUMA is the real gateway.",122

I've been with my girlfriend 8 months and I just feel so distant and unconnected to the relationship. She doesn't know about my use and me quitting, maybe I should tell her so she might understand why I feel the way I do. The only times I feel happy are when I'm alone which is sad. I don't think I'm depressed, I suffered with depression last year and this certainly isn't it. 

Weird thing is I don't crave using again, I get fleeting thoughts but no big craves. I don't think to myself ""i'll only be happy if I just got hold of a few pills.""",1

It’s nothing that’s too terrible to deal with or that smoking some tree can’t help with (sry if that’s not your thing), and thankfully my fiancée is amazing and just wants to help, but it def opened my eyes to the fact I need to get off this stuff as soon as I can so I don’t ever have to feel this way (at least from a substance) again. Was going to stay at 7mg for another month, then drop another 1mg down to 6mg/day, and then the same thing again until 1mg, where I’ll cut slowly as I’ve heard it’s tough to jump off completely from that dose.

2019-10-13 11:24:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/dhbyc3/so_i_slipped/,So I slipped,"My relapse about a month ago was strictly a suicide attempt. I stood outside my car looking at it, pondering whether it was worth it to keep struggling. I was standing outside the shelter I was living at temporarily while waiting for a bed to vacate in the veterans program that I’m in now. A much better place, cleaner, safer, and they got me a job which isn’t the best, but it’s easy and pays pretty decently in correlation to the amount of work i have to do. I bought a bundle of straight fentanyl and brought t back to my room at the shelter. I had a room because I am a combat veteran and they try to accommodate as best as they can. I wrote out a suicide note, 10 pages long. Wrote a letter to my girlfriend, and to my 1 year old son so he could understand why his dad left him. I struggle with ptsd from combat, which feeds my depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I don’t sleep so I constantly feel like shit, and because I’m on suboxone the doctors at the VA can’t prescribe me clonopin which is the only med that actually works. So that night i packed my stuff so it would be easy for the staff to get it out and give it to my family, put up a note saying “do not resuscitate, this was not an accident” and laid out the suicide letters so they could see them. I used as much fentanyl as I could, and laid there, waiting for the darkness to flush over me.

But, I woke up. I guess the suboxone messed up my plan, but I used a bunch but woke up. Right then and there, this being my third thwarted suicide attempt, I knew God had a plan for me and it wasn’t to od in a shelter. I got up, and went to the VA and checked in to the acute psych unit to be evaluated. I wanted to get off subs too, but they don’t detox you the right way at all, and I couldn’t bare it and just started then again. It was funny because the day I left, they asked “where are you going to go?” I said the shelter again I guess, and as they are discharging me, the social worker said that a bed had opened at the program I have been waiting for a month at this point. Gods plan. So I got discharged, and went over there. Great place, amazing social workers, very laid back and I got a job. But I continued to use.

I traveled down to a city 55 minutes away with open market drug sales, and found a spot that was cheap and good. I kept using finagling around drug tests and getting money for it from various people who want to genuinely help me. But I’m tired of it, it’s not fun anymore and I’m at the point I’m just using to get well again. 

I have subs that I get daily from the med closet, and I have a bunch stashed that I cheeked while using this last month. I want to induce comfortably using the Bernese method, and I have ibuprofen and gabapentin stashed in my room to help as well. But I keep using and not inducing. I was going to today but I already used some of what I had left, now I have a bit of h left, and the subs. I need to induce, so I work tomorrow I was thinking of inducing tomorrow morning after not using the rest of today.

This is such a mind fuck.. I’m a smart guy and I logically know I’m not getting high, but I keen using like I am going to be. I guess it’s just easy sniffing some powder off my little night stand. Idk why I posted this, I just want to get back on the right track. Everything is going well for me, I’m in a good program, I have good staff behind me supporting me, I have a job, I just got approved for a veterans grant to fix my car, I’m not on good terms with my girlfriend but I was going to save money to visit my son. They’re in a safe place with family, she never used once. Idk, I gotta get my head out of my ass.",17

The PAWS have been challenging. I'm still having a lot of trouble with oversleeping. I routinely sleep for 12 hours a day and somehow still wake up with little to no energy or motivation. Most days I wake up feeling lethargic with cold-like symptoms and just uncomfortable in my own skin. I've never felt anything like this previously.

Despite this, I'm finally actively searching and applying for jobs again. I've probably applied to over 100 job listings over the past couple of weeks. Being unemployed for over a year doesn't look great on a resume, but I've gotten some interest. I have 3 phone interviews scheduled next week.

In the meantime, I *really* need to work on improving my sleep and exercise habits. My routine is awful. I woke up at around 5PM yesterday after sleeping for 12 hours, and it's 6AM now, so that's not ideal. I'm open to advice.

I managed to quit H for about a year and gave up the point. Got on subs, that was its own hell then quit it for a 30 gram a day of Kratom habit. That wasn't fun either and used hydrocodone to quit those withdrawals. 
Relapsed on a gram of H two months ago, then weaned down to about 50mg of hydrocodone daily.
I don't advise using Lsd, but I needed to try it and haven't used since then. I'm starting to crave and my tolerance is so low I know a pill would make me feel good. I almost got one Norco because my brain says, one can't hurt but my brain is obviously still cloudy trying to trick me. 
I've kicked more times than I can count and at way higher tolerances but this fucking anxiety is driving me insane. I'm prescribed xanax but they don't work unless I take enough to sleep and weed just makes me feel even more burnt out and groggy. It's weird because yesterday I had less anxiety. It's always been an underlying issue of mine. 
Anyways I'm about to hit a record for me and that hopefully means I'm one day closer to feeling better.


Edit: almost day 8  Tried micro dosing acid after reading how it can help anxiety 48 hours ago. Well that was a huge mistake. I'm really sensitive to stimulants and didn't realize I'd feel like I'm tweaking 2 days later. When I tripped a week ago, it was my first time ever and I guess I didn't notice the anxiety because of the benzos the following days. Panic attacks now are so bad. I'd compare it to when I've done meth or coke. I hope I didn't re wire my brain in the wrong way.",34

I'm writing a research paper on the experiences of people who use or used weed as a means to help them recover from other drug addictions. Apparently, there are some (very few, so far) [studies](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/17/health/addiction-cannabis-harm-reduction/index.html) suggesting it can have a benefitial effect on recovery, not only from opiates, but cocaine as well.

Just to clarify, I am aware that recovery is a lifelong journey that goes way beyond any substances used to help with it. I am also aware that weed addiction has its own problems, however from a harm reduction perspective one can argue that its risks are less life threatening, and it can be a lesser evil for a person struggling with sobriety from a more health damaging drug.

Medical cannabis is already a reality in a lot of countries and US states, and addiction treatment facilities using weed as a part of recovery already exist (see High Sobriety in LA), even though it still lacks evidence to its efficacy.

My opinion is that we not only need research on the efficacy of cannabis in treating addiction, which we obviously do, we also need to research the subjective circumstances through which people have managed (or not) to recover, and the uses they give to it. For example (and these may be ridiculous examples, it's just to explain what a 'subjective circumstance' is), does using weed in more social settings instead of more private ones have an impact on the maintenance of sobriety (from other drugs)? Does the way the substance is consumed (like smoking vs vaping) have an impact on sobriety? Does looking at it as medicine rather than a recreational drug have an impact?

I am in no way trying to test whether it works as a treatment, as this is a research in social sciences. I'm looking to find people who for some reason found it helped them, hear their stories and how they incorporated it in their recovery. I am also looking for people with the opposite experience, who've tried using weed to help them recover, but it didn't work for them.

I'll be interviewing people irl who have agreed to share their stories with me, but I am very curious to see how you all feel about this topic. Please tell me what you think, be it either your opinion or your personal experience. If you prefer to not share it publicly, you can DM me.

I stumbled on the clips this morning when pulling up the show on YouTube for my little ones while I got dressed. I watched the clips and one discussed her having a tough time transitioning with her foster parents. 

Another clip had Elmo and Chris (the guy who works at Hooper's store) watch Karli while her mom goes to a meeting. They use language like ""she has a grown up problem so she goes to meetings where people have the same problem to talk about it."" Karli also says she goes to meetings with other kids herself. From what I saw, they never specifically mention opioids but have said in statements that's what motivated making this character. Thoughts?",85

I live in Australia and I've been using opioids since I was 14, starting with codeine. I'm now 29 and over the years I've done almost everything and had benzo and opioid addictions. 6 months ago I got hooked on poppy seed tea after my sources for pharmaceutical opioids disappeared, and it kicked my ass. I've tried cold turkey but the WD felt so bad I thought I might die or even kill myself. I'm a full-time student too and finally realized I couldn't live like this anymore. The stress and the insanity of making up enough tea to stay well or get high so I could function was overwhelming. So I went and saw a doc today and been put on the program. 

Not even sure what dose he put me on but I'll find out tomorrow. Had my first dose a few hours ago and I feel better, the panic is gone mostly and my body feels OK. Have an appointment tomorrow afternoon to find out if I need to go up or what. 

I'm really looking forward to getting clean though. I know that right now I'm far from the best version of me I can be, but that's going to change. 

Has anyone got any advice for someone new to the maintenance thing? How long do you think I might need to be on it? How quick can I taper? 

Any tips or advice on staying clean are much appreciated too.

Thanks for having me.

I have never done any street drugs. I am an alcoholic but been sober for one year. I am also bipolar, hate this disease!! Anyway, I started using loperamide to get away from the alcohol withdraws. At first it got me high then months later it didn’t do anything. I was taking 100 pills a day. So I quit CT and I had the worst withdrawals. They were extreme and the longer I went without the worst the withdraws. They are long last opiates. If anyone ever read “mad Margaret” then you know that she had extreme withdraws for 5 weeks then paws after.

So I couldn’t take the withdraws and got back on them. Then I tried to taper several times but couldn’t. My family wanted me off these pills and so did I. They ruin my life. So finally I convinced my family to put me on suboxone. They do not call Lope “poor man methadone” for nothing. 

Today makes a week off lope and 5 days on suboxone. The doctor started me off I 16mg - 8mg twice a day. I only been on them for 5 days now and the past 2 days, I went down to 8mg.  They are doing good and no withdraws.

I never been on suboxone but I’m only wanting to stay on them for 1-2 months. To get over the lope withdraws. These things are expensive - 250 dollars a month. My questions- should I go down even more? Will I get addicted to these things? How long should I stay on them? If lope withdraws are 5 weeks then should I stay on these for 5 weeks? Will I have withdraws from the subs?

Thanks and please stay away from lope!!!",2

Hey guys

I'm in a spot of serious bother and would massively appreciate some help from those of you who have kept their shit together after abusing acetaminophen and ibuprofen codeine products for a while or had issues with poly drug addictions. 

I was diagnosed adhd and take dexamphetamine and low doses of clonazepam which I usually finish within a week of a script

For nearly 3 years I've been using 5 - 12 panadeine extra (15mg codeine per tab) or 8 - 20 nurofen plus (12.8mg codeine per tab). It doesn't sound like much but it hits the spot for me and kicks me in the ass when I stop. 

I've tried CWE but can't get it right and can't really do it at my flat w partner and flatmates. 

To top that off, Im prescribed 40mg dexamphetamine per day and generally finish the scripts 1 - 2 weeks before the next payday. Probably take an average of about 70mg per day. 

I'm so  aware of the organ damage this can cause so please don't remind me. I have a degenerative eye disease and I'm going blind, plus issues with anxiety and depression. Whether these two things are correlated, I can't figure out.

I'm stressing about kidney symptoms (cloudy, foamy urine and swelling in face) and bowel problems (no strength in the pooper and can't pee properly) which are scaring the shit out of me. Constipation is a mother fucker 

I would be so grateful to hear from anyone who's been through a similar stint. If I go cold turkey on the codeine, how long will it suck for? What should I take or do to not make me go straight back to it when things get tough?

I'm also keen to know about dexamp withdrawal because that's the next milestone and that will be a world of pain I think.

I love you all and thanks in advance

TlDR: 150ish MG per day codeine habit w too much acetaminophen and ibuprofen + overdoing dexamphetamine prescription and worried about organ/other damage to my body",19

All right guys this is going to be a long post and a very deep post but the message will be clear. I'm going to start by giving everybody a little history on myself. I'm a white kid from the suburbs of Mesa, Arizona. I grew up in a broken home like the majority of everybody else. My dad took off like a bitch and my mom had to work numerous jobs and was never home.. needless to say I got to raise myself. Definitely not a good idea looking back on it lol. Got married in 2005, and because I had responsibilities now I got my first real hardcore job. I started working for a metal fabrication company that I'm not going to name. Over the course of three years I went from being the low man on the totem pole to the lead grinder at the facility. I've had this position now maybe eight months then my wife came home and told me that her boss accused her of cooking the books at the shop LOL. At the time she was like 20 and never did a county before and was not cooking the books just made a journal entry error and erased it instead of making a journal entry correction. Anyway that drove me into a horrible anger that they accused her of that and I punched the cat hut that was located in our bedroom.. and no, there was no cat in the cat hut at the time. I end up breaking the 3rd, 4th, and 5th metacarpal in my hand and thus begins my relationship with opiates. The first run I'm just going to breeze through. There was about a 9-month. Of time that I took the Percocet while dealing with surgeries. After the surgery it was hard to stop taking the low dose of Percocet I was given, but was able to stop taking them on my own I just had a rough month. Fast forward to 2009.. the day before Thanksgiving 2009, a few of my friends from out of town came in and we decided to go to the local skate park down the street. Long story short I break both of my legs. I end up going to the ER via 1998 Grand Cherokee driving like a f****** ambulance the whole way there lol. As I'm at the hospital a few of my other buddies showed up and he happened to be with somebody who referred me to a doctor for pain management. This Doctor ended up being pretty crooked and I was fully on board with it after my first run with opiates, I love them. They've been the only thing ever that has ever made me feel happiness, and real honest-to-god happy. from this point forward I proceeded to slowly destroy every aspect of my life including my marriage, job, and everything else all the way down to the relationship with family members. I continue to do this until 2014 when I ended up stealing my mother's wedding rings because she didn't wear them anymore and wouldn't notice that were missing... So I thought. My mom terrifies me, and when I found out that she knew,I have never been so scared in my life! and mind you I'm a grown ass man at this time. And when I say grown ass man, by age only at that point. I end up getting help and getting prescribed some stuff called Suboxone that 100% gave me my life back..  however they failed to tell you that you shouldn't take it for prolonged periods of time or you will just get addicted to that and have issues getting off of it. But like I said the s*** is a miracle, and did put me on the path to getting my life back. I just went to a doctor that really didn't know what he was doing I don't think. Anyways I have spent the last couple of years trying to feel somewhat normal now that there is no Suboxone and there is no opiates.. I have spent thousands of dollars on the highest grade supplements extracts and vitamins with no luck at all. for some things I even spent more money than I did on drugs just trying to get my brain to work a little bit closer to the way it did before the opiates.. to anyone who has never taken opiates, when you can't take them anymore it makes it impossible to be excited or have any kind of enthusiasm for anything. It sucks every molecule of motivation out of you every day, and every tasks are a horrible chore that you do not want to do. It makes life miserable that is why you never hear of heroin addicts really ever staying clean. It doesn't matter if 25 years pass, that shit never comes back, it's gone forever!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough to anyone is thinking about taking opiates or just started taking them don't do it, you will never be right again. I have found three supplements that actually do work and make life a lot easier for someone in the same position as myself. I'm just going to tell you the names of the vitamins I'm not going to give you a company name this is not an advertisement this s*** is from my heart and I'm trying to help somebody or anyone who has felt like me. if you really want to know where I get them sent me a message and I'll tell you.. the number one most important supplement or vitamin I take is called phenibut I take 1500 mg a day even though you should not take a daily, I do anyway. I also take a men's two-a-day vitamins that has selenium in it and then I take another supplement called redwood. these three things combined in the morning help me get through my entire 10 hour work day. it makes my life far more easier and I feel way closer to normal than without them. I hope this long-drawn-out post help somebody and please take it easy on me internet people,I've never posted anything like this before. Excuse all the punctuation errors but you get the idea",0

Thanks to my girlfriend/wife/mother of my child. She's been pushing me to get out of this habit. We've fought alot, I've made alot of promises, and broke twice as many.

But over this year one thing has been constantly changing. I have steadily been wanting to quit and putting in more effort. Before I had this women breathing down my neck wanting me to stop before our baby is born I didn't see the problem and was up to between 30mg to 50mg hydromorphone a day.

So, here I am, steadily tapering my dose.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Highest dose(common dose): 20mg through 50mg(during the peak of my addiction I would go through 140mg in 3 to 5 days spending 3 to 4 days in W/D :( 
ROA: Insufflation(plugging never seemed to give me any effect simply wasting the drug.)
September 1st: 20mg once a day @ 22:00
September 25th(until now): 10mg once a day @ 22:00
October 6th: The plan is to reduce 25% per 7 to 14 days resulting in dropping to zero-use within 30 to 60 days.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Am I doing this right? I've never had to do this before and my doctor knows that I have this addiction now. I thought of asking her to help me with this plan and (maybe) she could perscribe the hydromorphone needed for this tapering plan, but I don't want her thinking I am simply seeking a high from her perscription.

Any advice? Thoughts? I tried CT.....it worked for 7 days before constantly relapsing.",3

I have a full bottle of pills yet I don’t feel the urge to take them today I want my sober life back. I’m 32 no friends no job no motivation to even get up and clean my house. I don’t answer no calls or text everyday is drag & dreadful and let’s not talk about the depression I see life so non existent I ask myself when I see strangers how do they cope with this thing called life. A trip to the super market is a challenge.

I already ate a tasty ass Pizza and am watching a movie on Netflix right now. So far so good.

I will use the clonazepam I have to help with sleep and RLS. Also I'm stocked up on comfort food like ramen and keep myself busy with petting her adorable cats.

I will keep you guys updated tomorrow when the real struggle is going to begin. Wish me luck friends, I'm seeing this as the single best chance I get to sober up and finally change my life for the better.

I wish i could say there’s some miraculous wonder that’s happened in my life but there’s not. Every single day is a struggle. My friend had surgery last week and offered me some pills which i turned down. I was proud but my mind tried to trick me by saying “just a few won’t hurt”. She’s been on and off pain medication for 10+ years and doesn’t recognize her withdrawals as withdrawals. Her brother died of an overdose a few years back. I want to help her but she doesn’t recognize it as a problem because she is high functioning.

I went to Detox at the end of July and wasn't able to attend IOP that I was set up for because I knew someone in there. I ended up getting a suboxone doctor a few weeks larer, and while that helps most days, I can decide not to take it for a little while in order to get high. I moved right back in with my ex, who is also a chronic relapser. We will go 10 days, use, 30 days use, 7 days, use... last night I got so messed up, and now I don't want to stop. I don't think I'm going to be able to do it without rehab, man. Especially here. I dunno how to tell my probation officer... I am required to go, if I do, in the state if Georgia. My family is finally healing because they think I'm doing okay... I've yet to go to rehab, but I've been struggling for years. It's so hard to look at my mother and father and ask for help.

4 years ago I was charged with 1st degree robbery for passing a threatening note to a cashier to get money for drugs cause I was in bad withdrawals.  I went through withdrawals from heroin & suboxone in jail.  Bail was $100,000.  The first offer from the state was 10yrs 85% sentence. I said no and fought back.  I ended up getting downgraded to 2nd robbery and receiving drug court (7yrs 85% alternative).  Spent 6 months in a therapeutic community which really served me well despite how much of  a pain in the ass it was.  Worked a bunch of shit jobs when I got out.  No one would hire me not even retail stores.  Got a sponsor, home group and a strong network in AA - which essentially became my entire social life.  Did fun things with my sponsor & network like go to MLB games, NHL games, snowboarding etc.  After a couple years I got a huge break from someone in the corporate world who was willing to take a chance on me.  Now I have a better job with a violent felony record than I did in the years after I graduated college, having no record..... funny how things seem to just work themselves out if you keep doing the right thing. 

On top of that I'll be graduating drug court before the end of the year.  Thats about 3.5 - 3.7 years of drug court for a crime that I would've served 5.95 years (7yrs w/ 85%) or 8.5 years (10yrs w/ 85%) had I pleaded to the first offer. This recovering addict is nothing but grateful today.  I'm back on my feet looking for a house, on great terms with family and life is peaceful.  So keep up the fight, do the next right thing, keeps things in perspective. It does get better.",66
2019-10-05 12:53:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ddpseu/saturday_oct_5th_check_in/,Saturday Oct 5th check in,"Hey y'all! I've missed you guys. I really don't want to fall out of the habit of posting on here. I've been a lil MIA lately cuz for the last 3 weeks I was pulling nearly 70 hours between school and homework and work. It's been exhausting but, honestly, it feels good.  

I've had a weird kind of break through about my potential career as well. I've known I want to work in marketing for a few years now, but wasn't too sure of the specifics. When I went to sign up for school and pick a major this summer, the community college in my city didn't offer a marketing major, but they did have a brand new major starting that fall, fashion marketing and merchandising. I was kind of put on the spot to choose so I figured fuck it id go for it.  

A little weird background for context-  as a kid growing up in NYC, I was REALLY into fashion. I was obsessed with looking at blogs (this was the early-mid 00s) and even started one of my own in 06, getting a few article mentions in fairly well known online publications for being the ""youngest fashion blogger"" at age 12. I followed fashion weeks religiously, meticulously putting together outfits any time I left the house, and it was generally a huge part of my childhood interests.  Then, at age 13, came the punk scene. I became disillusioned with the fashion world for obvious reasons. Through my 10+ years in the punk scene, even while homeless and living out of a backpack,  clothes and aesthetics were still extremely important to me. I figured I had fallen out of love with fashion.  

 But the fashion and beauty world has changed a lot in the last 15 years, as have I, and through doing projects for class, talking with my  professor, and realizing that my interests never really went away, they just shifted, I'm realizing that I actually dont want to transfer out of my major- I thibk this is what I want to do with my life. I spent literally 6 hours reading through articles on an industry website I got free student membership to, and the more I read, the more I was like, wow, this shit is riveting, and it makes me happy learning about it.  

One of the main reasons I got so badly strung out is cuz I was lost. I had no purpose,  without the punk scene, no defined interests,  I felt as if I had lost my identity, something so specific and integral for me for so many years, and I didn't know what else to do other than drown it in dope and pray for a miracle. The horrors of being a bundle a day IV fentanyl addict seemed senseless. But I realize now that I HAD to go through that in order to get where I am today. All of it- the punk scene overall, traveling and riding freight, abusive relationships, getting ""86d"" by my fiancees crazy ex- led up to where I am today.  

And I have ambition now. Serious drive and desire to do everything I do, big and small, to 100% the best of my abilities, and this want to not be good and get by, but be the best and to be notably successful. I'm confident in myself and my abilities, but humble enough to now accept constructive criticism from people in my life. I never had these qualities before I went thru what I did.  

In a weird way, being a junkie takes drive. That shit ain't easy, getting up to $100 a day and then hunting down extremely illegal schedule I drugs. I think all of us addicts in this community could potdntially take that junkie hustle and ingenuity and apply it to the better aspects of life; our passions that don't involve a needle or pills. It's funny how things come full circle- 15 years ago I wanted to go to school for fashion, 5 years ago that prospect would've disgusted me, and here I am, a few days away from 25 years old, in some ways right back where I was at 10 years old when I would spend all of class designing my fashion line in my school notebook.  

I've been having problems with the fiancee that I don't even want to get into, cuz that'll be another 10 paragraphs and I'm not gonna hog the mike and do y'all like that, lol. Whether they can be resolved or not, I'm not going to let this take me down if things go south. If I'm being 100% honest, that immediate thought that comes into my mind when I think of my life with him ending is suicide. I would never do it, the number one reason being I could never leave my dog, the light of my life, but the thought is definitely strong and there.  

But last night, when I was 100% convinced that he was leaving, which I'm still not sure now is happening or not, I had to work Friday night dinner service. 36 seats, me as the only server, with help from my wonderful manager. We're both very good at our jobs, but dealing with all seats filled for 4 hours straight is intense even for industry vets like us with 10+ years of experience. I had been crying all morning but I got myself together and put on an appropriate-but-powerful outfit,complete with restaurant approved low heels,  and took my ass to work.  

A few years ago I would have called out or broken down and asked to leave. But no, I made it through that whole service and made a damn killing in tips (250 in 6 hours.. Yeaaa bitch lol). Sure, I cried in the bathroom once, and sure, it was rough serving a room full of couples on dates when I was fully sure I'd never be going on one w him again. My manager saw me looking upset when I was putting an order in in the back and was so sweet and gave me really helpful advice. The more I work with that lady the more I like her. But  overall, I made it through, and not only that, I didn't make one mistake, sold a shitton of specials, and did 24% overall tip percentage 😁😁😁  

Things like that and the idea of a new exciting career remind me that we're born alone and we die alone; at the end of the day, you can only really rely on yourself. For years I literally needed other people like a drug, the idea of spending even a few hours alone without calling or texting someone sounded like a nightmare. Then, when I couldn't rely as heavily on others, I turned to heroin for companionship. Although the idea of not being with R still is scary and sad for me, this is the first time in my life where I not just feel okay with going at it alone, sometimes I actually enjoy it.  

I think all these years, the biggest thing that was missing with me, and the thing that I strived for the most, has been self reliance. And historically, I have not been so good at it. There's been times that I've exhibited strength, like when I was in an awful abusive relationship at age 17 with a man 10 years my senior who I moved cross country to be with, my roommates were shitty to me, and I didn't wanna admit to anyone back home that I was failing.  

But that was hard, and since then I haven't been the best at staying strong while alone. And I'm still very far from where I'd like to be with that, but I've made a lot of progress. I hope that I continue to do so, and if things do go south in my relationship, that I can use work, school, and furthering my education and professional development in other ways, as a distraction. If I'm pulling 70+ hour weeks, i won't even have time to be sad.  

Wow y'all, I'm really sorry for that fucking novel of a diatribe lol. Haven't posted a super long one on here in a while though. Oh also, i finally have a normal m-f schedule! Which tbh I don't even like, I'd way rather work weekends cuz that's where the money is and have weekdays off cuz things are open and fun things like museums aren't packed with people. But it'll still be nice just to have two days off in a row.  

How is everyone else doing? For those newly clean, like 60 days or less, what is your favorite thing so far about the new and awesome life you've been living? Anyone have any fun plans for the weekend?  If anyone read this whole thing, thank you, youre the best, and I'm really sorry this was so long lol. Love you guys, hope everyone has a nice Saturday! 💜",4

I've been on and off opiates and opioids for around 9 years now. In all that time I've been a high functioning, but still a fiend. Mainly Vicodin, but the past 3 years have been around ~40 - 50mg of dilauded with stretches of sobriety. 

My question today is: I've been trying for kids lately unenthusiastically (lol). I've read the hormone imbalance can suppress your HBG and throw off your fertility...is this typically reversible? 

Also during the periods of sobriety, I've experienced depression (duh) as well as erectile dysfunction in the form of premature ejaculation. Is this common? Treated with SSRI's in one fel swoop? Is this a thing for life now?

I dont expect amazing advice, just looking ahead to fixing my life.

So many people are given opiates by their doctors who give them months and years worth of pills and eventually you realize they aren’t working as well, so he ups your dose until eventually he can’t anymore. Then you start taking more than you’re supposed to, and you notice that if you go too long between doses then you start to feel like you’re getting the flu. 

THEN, in many cases, your doctor cuts you off. Either because your original reason for needing the pills has healed, or regulations and new laws forced him to cut you off along with many other patients.

Now you need to find a way to buy pills, otherwise you’re going to get the flu again, complete restlessness, entire body aches, hot/cold flashes with goose pimples. Puking every 20 minutes, diarrhea, no appetite, and no sleep for a week.

Shit, these pills are fucking expensive. It’s draining my bank account. Man..my dealer also sells heroin and it’s an eighth of the price per high compared to the pills..maybe I’ll just try it and see what it’s like.

Wow, it’s better than the pills and cheaper. It’s a fucking win-win for me! But damn, my tolerance is building pretty quick. Now I’m buying so much just to keep from getting sick that I’m spending more than I ever was on the pills. 

I’ll just pawn a few things until I get paid, it’ll be fine. 

FUCK! I have nothing left to pawn. I can’t pawn anymore of my parents things or steal anymore money without them noticing. Maybe I can shoplift a few things and return them, just until I get my paycheck..

Wow, life really sucks right now. I own nothing, I have no home, my family/friends don’t trust me anymore, and my day revolves around hustling up just enough cash to keep me from getting sick..I can’t do this anymore, I’m sick and tired of this chaotic cycle. It’s ruined me, my life, my relationships, and the lives of the people closest to me. I need to stop this. I need to get my life back and stop hurting the people I love. I need to detox and go through the pain.

Hopefully this time I don’t give up and relapse after 32 hours..but it really is the longest 32 hours of my life. The whole week of detox feels like it’s never going to stop, and time becomes so incredibly slow. I hate every second of it, and knowing that I can just buy something that will make all that pain go away instantaneously makes it so much harder. 

But I can do it this time. I know I said that the last 10 times but this time it’s different. This time I want it for more reasons than just: “everybody wants me to stop and I know I should”. 

Holy shit, I did it this time! I made it through the pain!! I know the battle is far from over, but damn it feels good to get that week of hell behind me. Now I don’t have to be so afraid all the time, worrying about getting sick and planning my entire day around it. 

Wow, music actually makes me feel emotions again, and I’m happy and laughing more. I’m spending more time with my friends and family, earning their trust back and rebuilding these treasured relationships. I have a career and my life is great again. I can actually manage my own life and not have to lie, cheat, and steal everyday to buy something that will never give me complete, authentic happiness. I can feel things again, I can love again. 

Finally, I’m free.",48

I've seen a lot of people facing difficulty while trying to look for unbiased, unsponsored reviews for rehab centers, or even difficulty finding the right recovery method that suits their situation and needs.

So I made this survey and I'd like to hear your opinions if you think it'd be cool to have some sort of TripAdvisor or Yelp specifically for substance recovery.

Does Drinking bring on PAWS?,Hey guys. So I went on clonodine 2 months ago and ive avoided and kept clean of opiates. I have recently gotten nicotine patches and im trying to quit smoking too. Last night I had a few to drink for the first time in a while and I got very drunk. Today I'm feeling like im going through opiate withdrawls. I sure am trying to love a sober life... But im asking for anyones insight into feeling so squirmy and paranoid today. Maybe PAWS? Maybe my soul just telling me to stop all forms of inebriation already.,2

You may not be “clean” but you are sober. I went from using $300 worth of heroin, alcohol and crack every day for almost 14 years to 120mg of methadone down to 75mg now. I put in the hard work it took to stop drinking, smoking crack, shooting ketamine and dope, and hating myself to only going to the clinic once a week to dose. 
The definition of sobriety is the state of being sober. Maintenance meds don’t cause intoxication when used properly so don’t listen to assholes telling you your not sober. I used for so long I never thought I would be sober. I have been homeless, in jails, in and out of rehabs and I couldn’t stay off drugs. If i can do it anyone can.",106

I was put on 10mg perc by my GD for a back injury that I won’t get into. I’ve been taking about 3-5 per day for over a year- fully functioning. 

Now my GD has made me transition to a pain doc, who will not give me the same script. Instead, he has put me on a buprenorphine patch 5mcg/hr and our end goal is to taper off to see if I still have the pain or if it has been my body craving the perc. 

I took my lady dose of oxy Sunday night and put the patch on 18 hours later as prescribed. I’m doing ok- had a few WD symptoms and some pain, but I expected that. 

However, after reading through all of the sub WD horror stories, I am really nervous that I have just replaced a fast acting with a slow acting that will be even harder to taper off. I really can’t afford to miss much work and I have two kids depending on me- one of whom has pretty bad medical issues and needs me around to help. 

What are my best options to get off here? 

1. Stay on the patch and cut it each week until I am off?
2. Bite the bullet- tear this thing off and just deal with the WD symptoms from my measly 60mg per day habit? 

To add to this, we are headed to Disneyland on the 10th so I want to be well and happy on that trip- we have been saving for so long. However, again.. I feel that I could be getting myself into a bigger problem with these patches. 

This all came crashing down at the worst possible time!",1

These thoughts inevitably fester and ferment until a relapse occurs and brutal reality beats me down, which either sends me into a spiral or gives me the blunt motivation to white-knuckle it until the whole cycle repeats itself. Is there an alternative out there? Cravings are supposed to be a normal, natural part of recovery, so how do I prevent them from building up within me? Sometimes I hear people say stuff like ""maybe you're just not ready to quit"" or ""maybe you need to get your ass kicked a few more times"" but I really want to be ready to quit and I definitely don't want to get kicked in the ass anymore... Is it just as simple as getting a hobby to distract myself? Is there a way to reason with addictive thoughts? I'm just spitballing here....",9
