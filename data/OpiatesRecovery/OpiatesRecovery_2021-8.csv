Have a friend who ""needed support"" I tried I want her to come to this side so bad.  She looks 60 I look 30 but we are the same age.  Bro.  Everything she said and did and all I could think was how lucky I am to see how bad things have been for me.  That I knew nothing could stop me once I started and if I kept going nothing good would be left.  I wanted to, my poor cells in my body wanted to.  

Very strange notion that I came across and that was anything that you put inside your body your cells and all these different weird different little mechanisms pathways messages: they all have to react.  I actually felt bad for them.  ""Here comes the poison!"" They say oh goody!! 2 days later they are dying unwell unrested.  I could stay up for a week smoking pills without eating so I don't do that anymore. 

Addiction started with a broke back and ended with me smoking an entire bottle of pills.  I don't think it would have ever went that far without help from my ""friends"" but it doesn't matter how it started it does matter that it's over.  

I've gotten over a year clean once.  Mostly just 3-6 months and I break but I'm done dealing bc I'm too tired.  I can't anymore I get too tired and lose what can't come back from.  I can't afford to spare anymore or nothing good will be left. 

The grace of good is nearly always too kind.  I was just offered a job in a silly ass shop they actually want me to help manage.  (CNC programming quality management) 

I'm way too lucky and I will try to walk the line.  It's a hard line but it gets easier.  I hope everyone makes it out there right now losing unemployment is not joke.  The Senate meetings were awful they were literally mocking people saying things like when you send everybody home with a paycheck how do you expect anyone to go back to work?  That they gave 40 billion to employers as incentive to hire rather than giving unemployment.  Now is the time to look especially in manufacturing.

Fuck why did I do this I feel so fucking stupid.

Edit: 20 hours in since I took a dirty 30. My back hurts. I have the runs. Starting to get emotional. I’m realizing this is going to hit me like a truck. I dumped everything I have (last dirty 30s) down the toilet this morning. I don’t want to be on subs. I want to power through this detox and never touch these fuckers again.

Idk why the fuck that happened but I’m grateful. I think the clonidine is really helping me be able to manage this. Oh and also I keep crying. Uncontrollably crying. Will keep you updated.

72 hours in. I’m achy but I’m not feeling as horrible as I thought I would. Layed in bed for about 8 hours this morning. Got up. Walked around, stretched. Even jumped on the bike to get my blood flow going. No clonidine today. .25 mg Xanax earlier this morning. Unfortunately dosed a small amount of kratom(2-4G) that I’m really not happy with myself with because I could’ve gone without it. I’m still fucking kicking.

All of the posts I've found are archived and I can no longer comment on them or ask questions... I've been taking it for about 4 days now (and today will be my 5th once I take it) and I seemed to notice great results the first few days. I could wear a mask for the first time without dripping sweat like a weirdo while I was just shopping at target. I have a one-year-old son that I take to the park often and I typically end up leaving within 10 minutes because I'm sweating so f-ing much... and what's worse is that it glistens in the sun and sweats all of my makeup off. I know everyone is staring at me while it's happening and my anxiety just makes me split the scene which sucks for my son. Anyway, long story short (but not actually), the 3rd day I took it, I was still sweating like CRAZY and mind you, I took extra methadone because I've been on a self-administered taper (on top of my 2mg/week medical taper) for a while now.... and what I mean by self-administered is that I actually take out an extra 50ml of liquid at home and keep it in my old methadone bottles incase I ever had an emergency situation where I couldn't get to the clinic. (I only go a few times a month incase you're wondering how I can get away with doing that).

Anyway, back to the oxybutynin....my biggest question that I can't seem to find anywhere is how soon is it supposed to work?? I read online that it can take a few weeks when its being prescribed for bladder incompetence so it made me wonder if it could take that long for the sweating too?  
At the same token, I've read some posts implying that it took their sweating away immediately after the first dose. For reference, I'm prescribed 104mg of methadone and as soon as I get home, I take out all of my bottles and remove 50ml of methadone with a baby syringe and keep it as backup, so my guess is that I'm only taking 65 or 70mg, but it's hard to be sure because they slightly water down each dose. I think I initially started doing this to see how little methadone I could get away with taking before I hit withdrawal. About once a week there's always a day that I notice slight withdrawal coming on so I end up taking a bit extra to subside it and this week, I happened to take extra on the same day that I ended up dripping in sweat (even while taking oxybutynin)... which leaves me with the question, is this shit going to work for me? What was your guys experience on it? My mouth and my eyes are constantly dry and I ALWAYS feel thirsty.. so I've been carrying around eyedrops, using a dry-mouth rinse, and attempting to drink extra water.... but it's just odd that I'm still experiencing the sweating? Am I needing this give this a few weeks to benefit from the medication?

Are there any other tips you guys have for methadone induced sweating? I had NEVER sweat like this from suboxone or anything else. I used to brag about how little I would sweat....but now the jokes on me! I just ordered some ""sweat guard"" on amazon. Apparently you rub it on your face and it stings, but it keeps the sweat away for a few days at a time. I'll have to repot back incase it ends up being worth the 15 dollars it costs, (which is nothing if it actually does what it says).

I've been a user since my teens. I've always had a fuck you all find out my own way, curiosity for the taboo and dark periphery shit. You tell me this thing is dangerous I wont truly believe you until I'm half way dead nodding off pissing off everyone around me. First time trying H I was 17 with my junkie stepbrother and I was really not the type of guy who people who expect to be a dope user. Before that experience I was a bad drinker, obnoxious, overdoing, really no excuse to be drinking that much early on.

I had a weird mom and the first experience with opies is when she gave me her script for vics to appear cool, she also wanted me to get on her side. I remember it feeling like I found my place and I wanted to dedicate my whole life to this cause fuck the cost. I found salvation in my late teens when i found kratom, It helped me want to not take any drug that was offered to me. I was able to get my degree maintain my cooldome made some friends but I still gravitated towards other drug users. My best friend in college would go out with me to bars and we would pick up pain killers almost every night before we did something. I also because addicted to benzos I bought from the black market my stay in school. This entire time I felt like I needed it. I somehow got honors and straight As this period  I mainly kept my addiction hidden, some people suspected it. People mainly thought I was just a asshole or didnt care.

After years of daily kratom use which I didnt even like, I had a couple of really close deaths in my family that I couldnt handle because of my drug use that sent me into a broken state. I was genuine crazy and dont know how I didnt end up homeless. I tried to get sober but ended up getting a new place in a new state saying fuck everyone. This was the start of my last bender 3 years ago. Got addicted to PST and it got so bad I had to move into my dads house 2 years ago. My time there I found so many drug connects and this time was meet to get clean my dad was so pissed that I was living at his house and using. It all ended with me finding a dirty 30 connect 7 months ago that made me borderline homeless, crazy and possibly in jail if somehow god wasnt on my side. It got so wild even for a guy like me which ended in an event last month that scared the fuck out of me and it was the first time I've said Im done for good.

Ive just been so much of a pussy to do anything about it bottom line. I've learned post withdrawal that the key to not relapsing is helping others that are having the same problem I had. Drug use made me an insecure mess unable to deal or handle anything and truly waste my life. I think why people say you have to hit rock bottom to get clean is so you realize your not superman and also so you realize that sobriety is the only way to go as drug users have a tunnel vision towards destruction. But you dont have to let it go this far, you can always focus on the positivity early on. I also know theres no going back anytime I have a horrid day I can always look back on how far ive made it and remember the date.

Friends during addiction were non existent. People wouldnt stay in my life for more than a few months once they got to know what was really going on with me and I'm a naturally friendly kind person.

But this time it was totally different. I'm pretty sure I've shared my story in here before so I'll only do a quick summary..

Started using in 2008 due to an unexpected health condition & was prescribed percocet. Had NO clue you could even become dependent on them & potentially fuck your entire life up. But after being on them for several months & just cut off one day, I felt wds for the first time & Iegit thought I was dying. Went to the ER and everything (which as you know, they didn't help at all).

Anyways, started buying them on the streets. Did that from 2009-2015ish. First OC 80s then switched to 30s when OPs came out. Then switched to heroin because of the price difference. Then to fentanyl & did that straight through until I got clean.

I tried rehab, detox, and suboxone an embarrassing number of times throughout that entire decade & always relapsed. But I got pregnant unexpectedly and had my first child in 2019 and that's when everything changed. Me & my bf (my sons father) both stopped using together on the same day and took recovery seriously for the first time ever. We also both tried MAT and IOP for the first time ever and the combo of that & having our child is what got us to stop using. We now had someone that soley depended on us and in order to be the best mother & father possible, we had to change everything. And I literally mean basically every aspect of our lives. So that's exactly what we did.

We also used to do other drugs too and once I picked up a needle in 2016, I started shooting everything. But we haven't touched heroin, fent, coke, ketamine, molly, any rcs, & haven't even smoked weed in 2yrs now. Not that I consider weed a ""drug"" anyways but yeah.

I'm currently 32 weeks pregnant now with another baby boy. And how we're looking at it as our first son got us to change our lives & stop using. And our second child is just another kick in the butt to make sure we stay clean. We went from being homeless living in my shit box of a car, lost my good paying job, no money, panhandling, lost all friends and family. To now we have a nice home for our family, a brand new car, money for everything our kids could ever want, $ in the bank, we're able to actually pay bills (and on time!), and I have the best family & friends support in the world.💙

So for anyone out there struggling, just know its never too late to turn things around. If two hopeless junkies could do it while having used for a combined 26yrs straight (11yrs for me and 15 for him), then anyone can. It wasn't easy but its so beyond worth it.😊",43,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4717117}"

They were sitting alone at the party and upset. They said they feel like a failure, a fuckup and several other things. I told them that a fall in does not discredit the years they stayed sober, hugged them, said to never stop trying and that they can talk to me anytime if they need it. They also said that they've been on detox but didnt specify when time wise. Thats about as far as we got before one of their closer friends came over to talk to and motivate them.  

Now this shocked me quite a bit and I might have not given the best responses, but I'm wondering if there's anything more I can do? I think their closer friends and parent knows and it didn't quite feel like a plea to help but I feel like I can do more to help and I'd hate to leave someone to fend for themselves when they need support. I was sober but I think they were drinking. 

I know this is and will be a life long struggle for them. I'm just at a loss when it comes to what I can do. I don't know how recovery works. We get along well but we don't really talk outside of situations where we meet. 

Is there anything I should say or help with now? Anything I should do differently if this happens again? What would you like if you where in their position?

Always over confident, got a college degree, a great job, and make a ton of money. I always fucked around with opiates since high school. It seemed like my school used pills more than alcohol. It definitely was my social lubricant. I always was “in control” or whatever I justified my bull shit to be but about 4 months ago I started using pure carfentanil and that shit was a whole other level of beast. I seen people who shot up grams of heroin be able to smoke a couple hits and actually put the needle down for it. Well my 20 dollar a day habit turned into 100 dollars a day real quick and I noticed that I either was going to detox at home or detox in jail. I chose to detox at home. I got myself in a Suboxone program but could never make the 36 - 48 hours to actually be able to take the sub. And yes, if you take sub too soon it will fucking send you in the worst withdrawals you will ever go through. Like pissing, shitting, puking on yourself. Next level shit. I kept going back to the program a failed man. I told them not to give up on me because I knew I was no longer in control. I hated the fact that I was a slave to something, it made feel like I was a bitch to something, and I aint a bitch. Because I couldn’t get with the program they sent CPS to my house and they took my kids away. Luckily my parents are amazing and the kids are over there and not with some random fuckers. Now it was on, no one takes my kids away. So it was time. I fought the hardest battle to make it 36 hours without doing anything, and I was ready to take sub. Reality hit when 32 mgs didn’t do shit and I was very sad that I wouldn’t have a cheat code to get through this. So it began, the ultimate battle to get my kids back. Day and night for 4 days, cravings, sweats, goosebumps, depression. I guess it wasn’t as bad as it could have been because of the sub, but holy shit, I’ve done heroin for years and was able to come off no problem, and fentanyl is next level. It’s now 2 months later and I am taking a 2mgs of a sub a day and I got my life back. They wanted me to take 32mgs of sub a day but I was fuuuck that shit, I eventually need to come off the sub too and I know from my past that I will have no problem getting off 2mgs. Honestly I could have tapered off the subs by now but I want to be sure I dont relapse and 2mgs is just enough to get a tiny kick of energy in the morning for a full work day. I’m on track to get my kids back in the next couple of weeks. 
On a side note, this was all possible because I’m irreplaceable at work and they gave me as long as I needed to recover with paid medical leave so, money wasnt an issue while I was a dead sloth at my house. My entire family is amazing and are all involved, my dad had to literally barricade the door for 3 weeks but it was nice having him by my side and we both painted my childhood home during my medical leave. It helped sweat the demons out and it gave me extreme nostalgia of my happier innocent times. My family did not treat me like an outcast or some kind of disappointment that shouldnt be on this earth, I think its important to know for anyone going through recovery they need their family to love them. And last but not least, I have the strongest fucking mind on the planet, like not to be arrogant but that detox was HELL, like not scared of hell one bit as long as I dont have to do that again, and I got through it. 
So only time will tell but the highs were not worth the lows and I got lucky as fuuuuck. I’m just happy to have my body and mind back. At the end of my habit, I wasn’t even getting high, just getting to a functional level. I’m excited about the future and I’m stoked on the loads of money I have, like you dont realize how quick 100 bucks a day adds up but damn, I can do ALOT more now. So cheers to recovery and fuck being a slave. 
I say all of this because 1, it helps to write things down, 2, during detox it feels like there is no hope and minutes are lasting days but YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT, just keep breathing, and 3, it’s never too late to change. If you really want it, you can do it. Like I said I am only on month 2 but now it is all up to me. The cravings are mental and I have the choice. I am choosing to sacrifice opiates to have my kids and I know it will be worth it. I’m trading 1 fun thing for a hundred of fun things, which sounds like a win to me. Good luck to all those choosing to get clean, it is not easy, and I hope you have the support you need. God knows I wouldn’t have been able to do it without my support.

July twent 19 he was out of control and I gave him the ultimatum to either go get help and we could continue our relationship or he can stay doing drugs but I would no longer be in his life.

 He said he wanted to get sober and was successful for almost one year in his sobriety.

 He then decided December 2020 that he wanted to start using them recreationally and spiraled so we broke up.

Fast forward to May 2021 came he said he was done using them and he had been clean for a while and we decided to get back together.

 Since then we have been bickering and arguing over stupidity and I could tell that something was wrong but didn't think he was using again.

He recently made a comment as hes still going to the opioid clinic about how he could cheat the system. I put 2 and 2 together and realized that he was using and he lied about it until he was back into a corner and then admitted that he was using sometimes on the weekend. I told them that in order for this to relationship to work he had to be honest and he had to be clean.

He said he was done using them and just really wanted to focus on being sober and working on the relationship. 

 We hung out the next weekend and he amitted the nest day that he was on oxy. He said that he does them because of me and when we fight he doesn't know what to do so he turns to drugs. 

 I haven't spoke to him since and  He just showed up at my house this weekend high as a kite. 

 I live 2 hours away from him and put up with it for as long as I could but then we got into a huge argument and I told him he had to leave even though his birthday was  the next day.

 Is it selfish for me to turn him away? He says that he wants to get clean for me but I tell him it's not for me it's for him and in the end it's only gonna benefit him.

I love him so much and I know he needs help but I don't think that I'm responsible to do everything up for him. 

 He puts me in this motherly role that I don't want. I'm just unattracted to him now because I feel like I'm his mommy and not his girlfriend.

I've tried calling him to make sure that hes OK but of course I've been blocked on everything and I just feel so sad because hes such a great guy when he's sober.

Is there anything else that anyone can think of that I can do for him because the only way he realizes that I'm serious is no contact.. Or do you even think I made the right decision or the wrong decision? 

I'm trying to work on myself to be the best person I can possibly be and i want the same for him so that we can eventually buy a house and have a family. But I can't do that if hes not trying to help himself.

2021-08-27 17:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/pcwrrb/never_too_late/,Never too late!!!,"I've been addicted to opiates since 2007 when OC 80s were prevalent in America. I destroyed many relationships and went to many rehabs where I would inevitably relapse after months clean. I used to be afraid of suboxone because in my mind I wanted to be clean of all opiates and was afraid of suboxone WD.

After over a decade of opiate addiction I finally said to myself that I'm going to try suboxone because I was so sick of having negative money and being sick every day. Inducing subs was a nightmare in itself because of fent being everywhere. I waited 72 hrs after my last fent dose and took 2mg of subs. I went into PWD but I toughed it out and laid in bed for 3 days next to a fan and heater so I never felt too hot or too cold.

I kept taking 2mg sub every 6 hours and eventually felt human again after about 5 days. I adjusted my dose up and down depending how I felt but I'm stable on 6mg a day for the last 9 months. Some morning cam be harder than others but I always feel normal 30 mins after my morning dose.

If you're in the US, suboxone is very easy to get, much easier than it was 5-10 years ago. The pandemic really opened alot of options for addicts with telehealth doctors being able to prescribe suboxone and comfort meds such as gabapentin, clonidine, etc. You can contact a telehealth such as bupe.me and get a script for a months worth of sub in the same day.

I know inducing subs can feel impossible but it's possible if you lower your dose and wait long enough. You can also try the Bernese method by slowly taking subs while using your DOC and slowly increasing the amount of subs you take while lowering the amount of your DOC.

I know being on subs isn't as ideal as being 100% clean, I wanted to be 100% clean so bad but I could never make it stick even when I was 90 days clean from everything after rehab. My quality of life is so much better on subs and for the first time in my life, I feel confident that I won't slip up and relapse on fent which could easily kill me.

I understand subs aren't for everyone and many people still feel cravings while on subs but my cravings have been minimal to almost non existant. I don't know how long I will stay on subs if not forever but I'm happy to be on it right now. My medical covers all my suboxone and is about to cover my monthly sublocade shot which costs over $1000 a month. I've heard tapering is easy on sublocade compared to tapering suboxone.

Moving forward to this week he is still testing  positive for fent. 

Before rehab once I knew he was dirty he would come out and say that he used or was using. Now he is denying it to the fullest, and I cant get him to tell me the truth. or I really dont know if he is telling the truth. Its really confusing for me because he wasn't denying it like this before. 

I don't know much about drugs and how long it can stay in your system, besides everything i read on google. 

He is giving me this story that it is a form of fent called ""carbfent"" or something like that, and it can stay in your system longer because it can stick to your fat cells?  

It feels like b/s to me but I am really trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

I understand that relapse is part for the road to recovery it can happen, but why is he counting to say he is not using when all week the test has came back positive??

I know I should be speaking with a doctor regarding this. The doctor originally prescribed me this a while back but I never took it. Just looking for experience and suggestions as far as taking this to get off H.

In 2019 I reduced my daily intake from 30mg down to 20mg, in 2020 I reduced down to 10mg and starting around March 2021 I have been continuing to taper and am currently at 4.5mg/day. The reason for discontinuing is that we are trying to start a family and there is a chance (per our fertility doc and my urologist) that the oxy is at least partially to blame for my low sperm count...that and I find my pain is just as easily managed with ibuprofen at this point and do not like feeling ""controlled"" (if that makes sense) to a pill - I want my life back.

The weird thing is that when I went from 30->20->10 I had very little issues...but since reducing from 10mg it has been rough. I have been doing a very slow taper of about 0.5mg/bi-weekly, thinking it would allow my brain time to adjust, but I feel like my cortisol level are very high. My eye was twitching for a few weeks and my nose has been twitching for a couple months. I go to the gym 5x week and eat religiously healthy.  I also feel like I am not healing/recovering from my workouts, like I had prior to my taper, and I think I experienced an adrenal crash right as I started my taper back in March - felt like a truck had hit me and just getting out of bed was a chore. The only thing that is different this time around is that I am on ultra-low dose Clomid, in an attempt to get a few more swimmers in the pool. I also had switch from coffee to cacao in the morning...but I think the increased serotonin/tryptophan from that was starting to cause some issues as well.

I feel silly posting this after looking through this subreddit and reading everyone's stories, but am curious of other longterm users who quit if a slow taper really helped them and how long it took for the ""stress"" hormones to return to homeostasis? I feel awful complaining on here, but I am very curious as to what others have experienced....I can find study after study on the effects of quitting alcohol and hormones leveling out (thyroid/fsh/lh recover fast and stress hormones much longer) but very little on opiates. Maybe this is the first time (now that I am below a clinical dose) that my brain is waking up.

Happy to have found this sub. I started a semi taper of tramadol on Monday. I was using for about 6 months or so. Before than on and off with no real issues. Towards the end of my hiatus I was taking upwards of 15 pills a day at 50mgs. Unfortunately I was also taking Wellbutrin and Pristiq. I cut the Wellbutrin & Pristiq but maintained my SNRi levels through the tramadol it seems. Right now the biggest issue is the vertigo and dizziness constantly. It never leaves me unless I’m laying down. Even after 48 hours of only taking 1.5-2 pills a day I’m managing but I can’t seem to shake this vertigo. 
Has anyone experienced this? Any advice? 
My psych isn’t available till a month from now. He didn’t even know I was doing all of this.

1- never go cold turkey on your own, consult with an MD 100% and learn about expected withdrawal side effects

2- tapering is important for many patients, and is far more successful.

3- will power is still important. Having an image of a loved one or a goal in mind is always helpful.


I was on 60, then zero for four days, now on 5mg three. I feel uncomfortable but sane. I was told to stay on this for a week then half the dose each week for three more.

yesterday i made a leap down from around 12mg to 5, taken one half at a time. it was ok until night. i caved when i realized it was 6 am and i wasn’t sleeping. panicking over sleep i dug out a 15 mg pill i had from a friend and broke it into quarters. the quarter piece knocked me out (for two hours) within an hour or so. it was just scary. i’m just worried i’m jumping down too fast. today i took a halved 5 that broke so bad i’m lucky if i got a tiny bit of  opiate and not just acetaminophen. do i take a second half so i sleep? do i just keep on this trajectory and fully stop? i can’t tell my family and i can’t be absent from certain events. i just don’t have the option.  what can i do to just function the next two days? do i just let myself level at the 5 mg for another day or two to get my system better adjusted?

Started snorting those. Got to about 5 or so a day. My fiancé would even dabble every now and then until she snorted a quarter and went total blackout.

While at his house I found out he had literally everything. He gave us a fair well line of some China before we left. It wasn’t even two days later I was back at his house buying a gram of China. That turned into a 2g/week habit. After about 2 months of that shit I went back to the 30s, the china wasn’t even curing my sickness.

Being from Texas we decided to go to Denver for my bday. Had a rave planned and all kinds of activities planned. But my fein ass found 30s right away.

We didn’t leave but for food and even then we tried door dash every chance possible. I ruined the trip.

I've been using EVERY DAY for about 2 weeks. I don't know the amounts. He would fill up a syringe to about 20 units (?). I did maybe 4/5 a day.

How bad will withdrawals be? I feel that I am mentally strong. Will I just experience nausea, anxiety, diarrhea?

What over the counter medications can I take to help ease the symptoms?

2021-08-24 12:30:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/paqsko/trying_to_quit_fentlaced_h/,Trying to quit fent-laced H.,"A while ago I was browsing here and saw a post about how to quit fent with Buprenorphine, with limited precipitated withdrawals. Basically, while you are still using, you slowly ease into your bupe regimen starting out with around 0.25mg/day (2x 0.125) and double your dosage each day until you reach 16mg. After a couple days on that dosage you're not getting nearly as high because most of your receptors are occupied with the bupe. There is some mild discomfort along the way as your receptors are getting used to the fent being replaced with a partial agonist, but in theory you should be able to quit relatively easily this way, all things considered.

I believe I was doing (sniffing) roughly 25 bags of pretty strong fent-laced H, daily. I tried this regimen and got to 16mg a day for some time but couldn't quite work up the will power to actually quit. I was afraid I would still get bad withdrawals from stopping cold turkey, and tapering off fent is something that never worked for me. I also didn't want to quit badly enough.

I'm giving it a shot again now since my addiction has been causing me so many problems and so much agony lately. Last week I tried quitting cold turkey and going straight to 8mg bupe daily. By hour 45 or so, even with copious amounts of comfort meds, the withdrawals were so severe that I just had to go out and cop and reset back at square one. 

So I started the regimen several days ago. I'm at 8mg today and not feeling too great, but it's definitely tolerable. I intend on doing my last bags Thursday, so I have the whole weekend to suffer if necessary, and will be able to go back to work on Monday or Tuesday. 

I'm posting here since it's where I originally saw this strategy, and I also could use some advice and support. It's been over a year since I've been able to enjoy my life and I miss it like hell.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5484992}"

Thanks to those who replied to my original thread. I really appreciate the support during this very difficult time.

To recap, so I got on oxycodone four months ago for back pain, worked myself up from 15mg per day to 60. One day I took 80mg and had a panic attack in the middle of the night and visited the ER. They said I was fine and sent me home.

It seems my mind if behaving differently to OxyContin now, it does not give me any pleasure but does offer pain relieve. I however decided to live with the pain rather than the side effects, it’s just not a long term solution.

So I tapered down to 30mg a day for three days now, I still get waves of anxiety but not quite as severe as the first panic attack last week. I experience a very slight high and breathing problems one hour after a dose ( I have been taking 5mg, wait for an hour, take another 5mg, and do this three times a day thinking this will avoid overdosing and yet offer minimal withdrawal symptoms until I go down to 15 in a week or so.

Problem is about 4.5 hours after the last dose of the day I get a pretty bad anxiety spell, almost a panic attack but not quite. I am not sure if this is from the oxy as I am not reacting the same to it now or did I taper too rapidly?

How should I proceed? I really don’t want to up the dosage, I hate these things now and scared of them. I also don’t want to risk my life and I keep thinking of my one year old daughter left fatherless due to me being stupid for so many months.

He was in active heroin addiction(5 years active) until January of this year, and then, after an intervention, he decided to enter into recovery. To my knowledge, from January-June he was sober. He had a slip and then re entered  an outpatient rehabilitation center towards the end of June and has been there ever since. I know he is sober now just by how different he is acting. He gets annoyed/ flustered easily, and takes a step back before responding to situations. He is working to be responsive, but not reactive, if that makes sense. He doesn’t want to cause himself unnecessary anxiety that would jeopardize his sobriety. He has stated he is putting his sobriety first and looking out for himself, which I applaud.
I am non addict, I don’t even drink, so addiction is foreign to me, and I’ve learned that relapses are expected and part of the journey of finding sobriety. I am very proud of him. It has been tough bc I have had no support from friends or family, which is understandable. They want to know I am with someone who is safe and dependable. 
His recent slip was so scary for me bc he didn’t tell anyone where he was/what had happened  until after the fact. I thought he might have died at one point. The past year has been stressful from all the resistance from my friends and family. I am hard headed and don’t listen. I have been hopeful and waited and wanted to prove them all wrong that he and I can work out, and that he can recover. Recovery is possible, I know! And I’m a strong Christian, so I know God can work out our relationship, if our relationship is in His will. My heart wants to wait until he is recovered and fully healthy, everyone else wants me to let the relationship go, and my head doesn’t know how much I can trust him. I will admit I feel like I have been overcompensating and pulling most of the weight in our relationship. I realize no matter how badly I want him to recover, he has to want it for himself , I can’t do it for him as much as I wish I could. I pray for him constantly and do love him so much. I just want the best for him, and to be in his life. I have also heard that relationships in recovery are very risky. I want us to work so badly, and also want to do what’s best for us both. I say all this to get it off my chest, and also to welcome insight. Thanks in advance!

I used some suboxone to help transition off a 80-120mg pharma oxy habit (around 2 months). I only planned to undertake a rapid taper, and as I approach the jump I’m concerned with what WDs are gonna hit me. The taper looked like this:

Day 1 + 2: 8mg

Day 3 + 4: 6mg

Day 5 + 6: 4mg

Day 7 + 8: 2mg

Day 9 + 10: 1mg

Given the strength and the super long half-life of suboxone, am I likely to get any bad withdrawals? Or because the subs have only been in my system for a week or so will I get away with it?

Bit anxious about what’s to come, so any thoughts would be really helpful. 

Thank you!

EDIT: Day 1 with no subs and don’t feel bad at all (well I do but that’s cos I was up until 6am on coke last night 🤪) but certainly no obvious withdrawals.

I understand that because of the stacking effect there will still be subutex in my system for a while…so therefore WDs don’t tend to kick in until they’ve left my body right?

It's the most terrible drug I've ever done. The high only last 30-45 min when injected and I start to get sick after 5-8 hours, and very unbearably sick after 12 hrs.

I did 18 grams of kratom yesterday that was supposedly 1.6% mitragynine and it didn't even touch the withdrawal. It actually made it worse from having to digest 36 capsules. I was burping up the kratom taste all day and my stomach was rocking. 

Last time I took a lab test the biologically active fentanyl was over 200 ng/mL and its metabolite, norfentanyl, was over 400 ng/mL. Those were just the maximum amounts the lab could pick up, it was actually higher than that. I never seen anything close to that in medical records, and those were mostly of the deceased who died from a fentanyl OD. 

I took 30mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate (Dexedrine) and 6mg of eszopiclone (Lunesta), and surprisingly that made it much more bearable than the kratom. I also took 2g of kratom too, the 18g almost made me puke. It's only been 10 hours since I did a half a bag though.

I was chipping before that and doing a lot of coke and drinking a ton and putting anything else in my body that anyone put in front of me. So I really haven't been sober in about 14 years.

So stick with it, don't give in to the temptations and life is going to get better. I had a good work week this week and it's nice knowing I have an envelope  of cash that isn't going straight to the d boy. 

Let me tell a quick story for anyone considering a relapse. My wife and I discussed this last night and how much better life is now.. It was about this time last year and my usual guy came and dropped off my shit. I metabolize shit a lot slower than my wife so I could go longer than her before going into wds. It was 10 pm and my wife comes in saying the shit was bunk. I said no way I thought it was fine and it was all in her head. Her wds just kept getting worse. I end up calling my boy and he has me meet up with him to give me 5 more grams of the uncut shit to mix in the bag. He warned me not to do it by itself blah blah blah. 

Get home and mix a .5 of that with a .5 of the ""uncut"" stuff. Still wasn't doing anything. There might have been a little but it wasn't enough to keep us not sick. I woke up the next morning and I had to go work on a cooler in a big fishing city. Whole city stinks like fish and it was a hot August day. I finish my job and I'm going into full swing wds at this point. 

Smoking a butt outside and this homeless woman looking all fucked up comes and asks me for one. I said sure as long as you can take me to score I'm sick. She agreed as long as I would buy her a bag. I said fuck it ill be you 2. I end up taking out 240 from the atm and tell her get me twelve 20s and you can have 2.

She got in my car and we go to the spot. I wait she's gone around the corner and I don't see her for a half hour. Thinking I got robbed, at the point my other guys calling me saying we can go get new stuff.

She eventually comes back all apologetic saying the girl had to bag it up when in reality I know she was pinching off all my bags. She proceeds to open her legs in my front seat and pull the dope out of her snatch. Mind you as I said it was a hot August morning in a city that already smelled like fish. 

I stop to get gas and she gets out at the gas station. I had the bags in my shirt pocket and the smell was so bad I literally threw up as I was driving home.

In 2006 I started obtaining prescriptions for various opiate medications due to a back pain that arose from a bicycle accident. The pain was manageable without drugs but I also used them to hide from my struggle with my sexuality. Over the period of 2 years that progressed into a pretty heavy dependence on opiates. Eventually I reached a point where it could no longer sustain the amounts of medicine I needed from a doctor to satisfy my addiction and dependence. I enrolled in methadone maintenance in my local town. My life began to improve despite a 2 year addiction to legal research chemicals from 2012 to 2014.
Finally with the support of my father I was able to get on level ground and I applied for a job at a local retail chain. I worked hard for many years and made my way into corporate operations and eventually into pharmaceutical consulting. In that time I’ve become fairly successful through careful investing in cryptocurrency and working hard and saving. I now own everything I would possibly want. My dream cars, several acres with a pole barn and several investment properties. Throughout all of this I was on methadone. I still am to this day. I have no connections to my past acquaintances and I am in a good place, however I am absolutely terrified to even attempt to taper off of methadone. Prescription medications allow me to have a great career but they also destroyed my life as a young man. Has anyone else had a similar story and was able to get off of methadone. It’s been almost 12 years since I started MMT. How can I put this behind me??",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5207157}"

Female, live in a major east coast city, Mid20s. I’ve suffered from depression since I was a kid, and it only ever felt like It went away when I transitioned to heavy drug addiction. I had a year clean this time last year and for the most part I felt pretty good. I still struggled some days but wasn’t suicidal. I relapsed in the spring but got clean again (although have had a couple slip ups but they’ve only been a day here or there) and ever since getting clean again a couple months ago I just feel like every day is agony. I feel so alone like I have no one to talk to, I feel like I have no friends and just kind of like a burden. I’m living with my parents right now while I try and finish college (it took me so long since I was strung out on heroin for the past 7 years which also makes me depressed but that’s another story), and before that I always lived alone or with my ex. Like I said I’ve always been depressed I just used to mask it with drugs. I also have a lot of trauma (finding my bf of five years dead, rape etc) but I don’t think really any of it is the cause of my depression  I just feel like I see no light at the end of the tunnel.  I have enormous trouble opening up with how i feel to anyone, even my parents who are incredibly supportive and my biggest advocates despite all I’ve put them thru.  They’re strongly encouraging (or should i say requiring) me to go back to therapy but I hate talking about how i feel or my depression because i always feel like someone is going to think Im overreacting and I’m just bad at opening up. I’ve tried to kill myself twice (once probably three years ago and once a couple weeks ago) and I’m seriously considering it again.  Therapy has never worked for me or really made me feel any better. I’m open to trying new medicine but I know that can take a long time and I honestly don’t know if I can wait that long. I literally sit around all day and cry or feel like crying, do a little schoolwork, sit on my phone, and just feel hopeless. I know people say in early sobriety it’s normal to feel like this, but I’ve been sober before and still feel like this. I do still smoke weed, and sometimes I’m like fuck it I might as well do hard drugs again at least sometimes I had a false sense of happiness. I just don’t know what to do if it was not for my parents I think I would have jumped off a bridge by now. I feel so lonely and when I’m in a better headspace I’m a pretty independent person so I don’t mean physically just like mentally and emotionally.

I’ve been addicted to oxycodone for a little over a year now. My addiction started when I made a friend a year ago (who is no longer my friend for obvious reasons…) and he had hella scripts for hydrocodone 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg, along with codeine Tylenol  30s and Oxy 512s. He was very poor not to be rude and was desperate for weed and I having a medical card always have ZaZa on deck lol. Anyway he one day traded me 2 hydro 5s for 2 grams of bud and I instantly fell in love with the feeling from the hydrocodone. Eventually over time I ended up trading him 2 ounces of weed in a span of 3 months for over 100 pills being all hydros, codeines, tramadol and oxy. Eventually he ran out and I was “fortunate” enough to find a bunch of consistent reliable plugs for perc 10s and Roxi 30s/blues (all pharma) I had a good job at the time which I just recently lost due to my addiction but I’ll get to that later. From January-April I was getting hella Perc 10s and blues/30s until may my main plug ended up getting pressed Roxi 10s the pink pills K-56. Obviously they were pressed with a fentalog… I fell in love as it was the strongest most euphoric opiate high I’ve ever felt. I also didn’t have any other plugs at this point so I had no choice but to keep doing the pressed pinks :( Eventually I found a reliable consistent plug of real pharma 30s/blues for $26-28 all the way so in the last 3 months from January until last Monday I was doing 6-10 blues a day… I’m not kidding when I say that and with no issue either my tolerance Is so high that I have to rail 4 blues at once to catch a high not even a nod… I was doing 180-300mg of pharmaceutical oxycodone every day for 3 months straight yes I was spending $1-2K a week for the last 2 and a half-3 months… that’s around $6K blown on pills. I finally decided to get help and am 4 about to be 5 days clean today. I went and did a procedure called an ultra accelerated rapid opiate detox at the Coleman institute for addiction and medicine and went on naltrexone implant therapy. This place saved my life! On about to be 5 days clean from a 2-3 month daily habit of 180-300mg of oxycodone I can officially announce that throughout this process I had felt no WD symptoms at all! I am feeling great on day 4 rn! It feels as if I’ve been clean for 14 days this place is truly a miracle. I love all of y’all and hope y’all are staying safe. I sure am going to miss the good ole oxycodone but the grass is way greener on the other side! 🙏🏽❤️💯",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5785838}"

I'm a recovering opiate addict, I was pretty heavily addicted to heroin in the past and recently I became very addicted to fentanyl. It was to the point to where I was homeless and living on the street, stealing and panhandling to feed my addiction. I've been clean for 6 weeks now and my life is really as good as it can be right now. I'm back with my family, I'm medicated correctly for my mental health issues, I see a kickass counselor, I'm working out again, and I go to a Lifering or SMART Recovery meeting almost every day. Things are pretty great.

With that being said I am struggling again with feelings of not deserving to feel this way. I have put my family and friends through hell, and when I think about how well I'm doing I end up feeling shame. I know that shame will just bring me down and cause me to relapse again. This isn't my first rodeo and I've dealt with these feelings before. I honestly can't help feeling like I don't ever deserve sobriety or happiness.

I'm also struggling with my two sisters not speaking to me. They are well within their right not to want to speak to me, but it still sucks. My older sister has 3 young kids that I adore, and I am also not allowed to see them either. Something that's bothering me is I feel like my sisters resent me for getting clean again and trying to have a life. I overheard them on a 3 way call with my mom the other day (I am living with my parents until my first paycheck, after that I have a spot in a sober living I'm moving into) and they were treating my mom like shit for helping me. 

My dad makes good enough money so that my mom hasn't had to work the past few years. Instead my mom had put her energy into my sister's kids. My mom has babysit for my sister almost every day for over 4 years (since my niece was born) so that my sister does not have to pay for daycare. My mom had also been helping my other sister plan her wedding for next year. I really haven't been in the picture much these past few years due to being in long term rehabs or actively using.

When my mom got off the phone with my sisters I asked told her I overheard them and I asked what she said. She said that both of my sisters wished I was still on the street, and that I will just break my mom's heart again. They told her they wished I wasn't here and that I'm a burden, and they just want things to back how they were before I came back to get clean.

I explored this with my counselor today. She said my sisters have a lot of resentment towards me for what I put the family through, which is understandable. She said they also resent me for now taking my parents' attention away from them. The fact that I'm doing well is pissing them off apparently. I don't know how to feel. I almost felt like just throwing it all away just to make them happy. I feel like a burden and a nuisance. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my life and today was the first time I had any since I got off the street six weeks ago. 

I apologize for the long post, I just wanted to get all of my feelings out there. I appreciate any advice, encouragement, or anything else y'all have to offer. I guess I should add that my sister is pretty narcissistic and she abused me pretty bad physically and very bad emotionally while we were growing up.

on wednesday I didnt take anything, withdrawals werent as bas as in tuesday or Monday despite the odsmt for some reason, my guess is that dipyanone still locked receptors, since it has much higher affinity. 

now is thursday, where temperature dysregulation was still bad, and Im also incredibly fatigued, especially my legs keep freezing or sweating.

I use seed tea twice  a day. I cut it right back along with a whole lot of other shit including a 10 year nicotine gum habit because I was getting a sore throat, and this is how it started. Ended up with an ENT and put on shit for reflux but also diagnosed with esophageal motility disorder.  Months later no change. Basically I feel like my throat is inflamed, but also I get horrible gastritis, almost constantly. I've been tapering down the tea and skip some doses. I have mild withdrawal but it's all the weird stuff going on that's getting to me.

I read about this opioid induced esophageal dysfunction thing and it's got me wondering yet again. The cure in a case presentation was giving the person the laxative for opioid induced constipation.

I hope this post wasn't a negative influence or caused any demotivation. Maybe a debate for some people but I personally believe a life with balanced goods/bads that aren't injected/snorted/taken is more fulfilling than a life on drugs. It DOES get better when you get sober, It just takes some time. Life is always up and down, But for people like us who have experienced the extreme highs and lows of that scale it becomes a bit difficult to place yourself in the middle where reality sits.

I don’t think he’s used his DOC (heroin) but I think he’s been drinking and maybe even done some other drugs. Which is how he gets his foot into the door for a downward spiral. The problem is I’m just not sure.

His behavior and actions lead me to believe he has started to slip and is hiding/lying to me. I’ve asked him repeatedly to be honest with me - however, he maintains nothing is going on. Which is what he said before when he was in full blown active addiction, having withdrawals in my bed, with a positive drug test in the bathroom.

Right now he’s content to not discuss it. Go on about life as normal. Because, ya know, nothing is going on according to him. But I can’t shake what my gut is telling me.

I wrote him a letter but I haven’t given it to him yet. Basically saying I love you and want to support you, but I can’t do that if you aren’t being honest. I also said don’t worry about hurting or disappointing me if you slipped. It hurts me more when you lie and hide things from me. I’m trying to be supportive, but I’m at the end of my rope. I can’t support him 1. If he’s not being honest with me or himself. 2. To the detriment of my own mental health.

My anxiety is through the roof and I feel like they will be neglected. I also feel intense anxiety as I lied to work as to why I needed time off.

I also found one pill of Clonidine that helped as well. It was hell but the Kratom did give a wave of relief for a short bit. I didn’t use the powder as my stomach would have lost it. I used Kratom ground tea leaves. You buy them as crushed leaves. Boiled water. Dumped 1/4 cup of leaves in the water after a few minutes (you don’t want water boiling as it’s too hot) and let it soak for 5 mins.  Strained it and drank that a couple  times.

     It seems like I can’t get past a month. I mean I know I can but do I want to? I do want to but I don’t. It makes no sense but I think someone here can understand. I’m a chronic relapser, so I’ve tried to stop many times but always used again. The more clean time i get the more denial sets in. Can I really be an addict if I have some clean time now and have a job? The answer is yes. I’m assuming most people here are guys, but I’m a girl. So when I’m on my period, I want to use even more. Everything pisses me off or gives me anxiety and all I want is the sweet bliss of opiates. I try to ‘play the tape’ through though. I don’t want the extreme guilt that comes along with it or the withdrawal symptoms. 

   Also, I’ve been feeling pretty worthless lately. I’m 23 and don’t have much going for me. I work at a restaurant and don’t make very much but at least it’s something. I think I have borderline personality disorder so I have unstable relationships with people. Meaning I ignore people and hang out with nobody, I prefer to be alone.

Stupidest choice of my life. You would think almost dying would help me stay sober. After some heart issues flaring back up I couldn't get back on Suboxone due to anxiety and without taking time off work which I couldn't do.

Looking for some advice, I am recovering from opiate addiction but still get unbearable immense cravings however I find that cannabis completely elevates my cravings and puts my mind in a type of perspective not to use.

I am at conflict because I know many recovery programs insist on ""complete abstinence"" and I am wondering/becoming anxious about whether I am not really recovering if I am using Cannabis during my recovery?

Overthinking this and the whole total abstinence aspect tends to give me more anxiety about my recovery...

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I did have an addiction counselor once tell me ""Can't you just smoke alittle weed instead of using a hard drug? if that works do so"" but I would like to be in a recovery program and will feel like a fake if I'm not ""total abstinent"" as these recovery programs  all seem to insist.

I am wondering if anyone has some advice on my situation? cannabis seems to really prevent me from using and I do not smoke heavily only when I'm having an intense cravings and a small amount in the evenings some nights.

should I feel less anxious if this works for me? Or am I not really addressing my problem? Should I feel guilty about this? does this prevent me from entering a recovery program?

It eliminated my cravings and I did not try using while on it. I got off it, relapsed, got back on it earlier this year. Relapsed while on it (2weeks after shot) and FELT the opiates. Relapse continued, got addicted again, went to treatment. 

I got back on vivitrol about a month ago, and was still having intense cravings. I tried using about a week and a half after my shot, and still felt the opiates. I’ve been using since. The vivitrol does not seem to be blocking the opiates for me. I’ve gotten addicted again and now am trying to start suboxone to get off the heroin. 

I can’t find any information on cases where the vivitrol fails to block opiates. I’ve talked with the vivitrol hotline as well, no information on why the vivitrol could be failing to stop cravings and block the effects of opiates. 

Does anyone else have experience with vivitrol just not being effective? It worked so well for me in the past. It’s really discouraging that I can no longer count on it as a measure to keep me from relapsing. Now that I know I can use and feel it while on vivitrol, it no longer feels like the best option.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7151658}"

Anyways, I came pretty close to giving him an ultimatum, or a bottom  line; the pills or me and the baby.  We've been financially tight the past few months due to me having a difficult pregnancy and then giving birth. Hes spending nearly $800 a month on these pills. Money we desperately need for bills and food. 

I want to go back to work and help ease the financial burden but I can't leave our 2mo son alone with him fucked up on percs.

He told me today that he's planning on detoxing this week, bought Kratom to help with the craving.  Hes already having withdrawal symptoms  :/ 

I desperately want him to be successful at kicking this addiction down. It is destroying the love of my life. I know I can't do much but I want to do as much as I can. I don't want to enable him anymore and I don't want to uproot my life if I don't have to.

Then, last night, my old plug hit me up.","Background: I started oxy in 2016, got up to 300mg a day, ended up dropping out of school, losing job, losing apartment, destroying life, you know. Got pregnant, tapered to 60mg, got arrested. After 6 days clean in jail, they took me to a methadone clinic. I didn’t really want to be on methadone but theh told me if I didn’t my baby would die so I started at 10mg, went up to 35mg over the next year, stayed clean on methadone for 2 years, then relapsed with fent. I started shooting up within a week. 8 months later, December 2019, probation caught me and I spent 3 months in jail cold turkeying off fent and 65mg of methadone. Came out and relapsed immediately, got back on methadone, got clean in October 2020. 

Every single day since then, I’ve wanted to use and have talked myself out of it. I tell myself I can use when I’m off probation in December or when my kids start school next year and I just keep pushing it further out and pray I can keep convincing myself to stay clean. Yesterday I looked at my kids and thought “I’m really done. I’m never going back.”

Then, my dealer who isn’t a dealer-dealer, just someone I knew from the methadone clinic who buys a few extra bundles from the city and resells in my town half an hour away, sends me $1 ON CASH APP TO GIVE ME HIS NUMBER. He got arrested September 2020 and if he hadn’t I never would have gotten clean. I blocked him, his wife, his cousins everywhere when I got clean. And he went and sent me $1 to contact me. He was supposed to be in jail for years bc the new possession charges he got were like his 5th probation violation. 

At first I was excited bc I wanted to catch up - we became friends after seeing each other every day for 2 years. Then I realized it was a number w an area code that isn’t from around here so probably a text free number. 

I saw a post yesterday about people talking about some evil force that keeps you on dope when you try to get out - the bag or money that pops up when you run out for real and think you’re finally going to get clean, the connect that pops up when your solid one gets arrested. This definitely made me believe in that. 

I still want to text him, that shit part of my brain is convincing myself I’ll just get 2 bags, I’ll just do it once....but we all know that doesn’t happen. Fuck. 

Tl;dr got clean when plug got arrested, spent 10 months convincing myself not to relapse, decided to stay clean for good...then plug send me $1 on cash app w his number. dope devil is real.

I feel like a horrible mother and human who doesn't deserve her when I get messed up. I have no idea what fent or car fent or what toxins used to manufacture.  Having that around evening the other room puts her in danger.  

My ex graduated college and basically dumped me to start a new life across the country while I could possibly do that to elsewhere my credit is so terrible it really is a bad idea.  

I have no family whatsoever father killed himself grandma was the same one she died over ten years ago.  My mom is very selfish and I haven't seen her in ten years because of exactly how selfish she was I can't get over some of my childhood memories.  She took my food off my tray from a food line and when I asked them for more telling them she took it, she got me around a corner and slapped me.  I'll never forget it.  

I feel broken and I don't know how to fix myself.  I think about killing myself.  

A neighbor shot his roommate and that cemented several long distance rocky relationships I did have with friends who no longer wanted to associate with me or that associated me with them.  I don't exactly look terrible but I don't care for myself often this often leads people to wonder of I am on drugs or what exactly is wrong with me. 

Debilitating depression.  I mean to get up and make coffee feels like I absolutely couldn't most days I feel like a broken gear just grinding down the axils and forcing myself to do everything.  I did better when I forced myself more I suppose.  

Illusive happiness.  I was sober for almost a year and then I relapsed started kratom earlier this year.  Dead sober I was really crying all the time.  I felt like killing myself a lot of the time.  I started kratom and it made everything better but it didn't last I was mid  tapering when this last relapse happened.  I decided kratom has been overkill I wasn't eating as much all the old same problems have come back and the depression came back too.  

Idk anymore what to do I feel doomed to do this over and over again.  I want those 5 years so bad to have my chances go up but never seem to make it past that year.

First, thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this and/or respond. I’m sorry for the long post but I tend to get long-winded, and I feel like more info is better than less.

Anyways, I need some help/advice. My girl and I have been trying to cut down/quit our fentanyl use for a while now. A while back we tried a rapid methadone taper, and tho it worked well enough for me, I didn’t end up sticking with it cause, well, it’s hard to start feeling things again.

It didn’t work so well for my girl. She had a REALLY hard time with it. Still had HORRIBLE withdrawals during the taper, so she was supplementing the methadone with fentanyl, tho it was tons less than she had been using without the methadone.

We finally had enough. We decided last week that we were gonna get on the clinic. We went a couple days ago (Wednesday morning). Had to go to the main clinic for intake which is about 45 minutes away before we’re able to be seen at the one locally. Drive there, fill out a bunch of crap, then they do a physical, you get dosed, and then the next day you can go to the clinic in your hometown. So I got called in first, and I’m waiting for the dr to come in for the physical, and my girl texts me upset and crying cause they refused to treat her cause she has “active” prescriptions at the pharmacy for ambien and Ativan (neither of which she’s taken since we started using the fentanyl, and neither of which we’ve even bothered to pick up since the beginning of June). She begged them just to check the urinalysis, and they’d see she only has fentanyl in her system, but they just treated her like she was lying and lectured her on the dangers of mixing those drugs with fentanyl and with methadone. They told her she needs a letter from her dr saying the prescriptions have been discontinued, and she can reapply at the clinic in -60 days(!)- after she has detoxed from these pills that she doesn’t even take.

I almost went home, cause we were supposed to do this together, and I just feel horrible. She’s so upset. The fucked up thing is that I actually wrote on the paperwork that I’ve used benzos in the last 30 days (tho none showed up in the test.. probably missed that by a day or two). Nobody even said anything to be about it.

After much discussion, we’ve decided to try doing the methadone taper again so we can do it together and be off this horrible drug. I’ve just got a few questions:

Last time the dosing schedule we followed (attempted to follow) was day one 40 mg, day two 30mg, then 20, 10, and 5. I’ve been on the methadone 3 days now @ 30mg. I’ve still been using fentanyl tho not as much. I have almost no withdrawal symptoms. Is there a way for me to start a methadone taper still? Any suggestions anybody might have? I’d really like for us to do this together. What should I use for methadone the next few days to be successful with a taper without feeling like total garbage?

Secondly, and more importantly to me, what is a good way to implement a rapid taper for her? The above mentioned dosing schedule didn’t work for her last time. She felt like shit the entire time until she gave in and started using fentanyl with it. Would it be appropriate to maybe start off with a higher dose of methadone? Maybe do a 50, 40, 30 20, 10? Maybe even split her doses so she’s taking half in the morning and half at night?

Lastly, if as a last resort she’s still feeling absolutely horrid, and she supplements the methadone with very small amounts of fentanyl, what sort of outcome can we expect? Is it possible to at least permanently cut her fentanyl use? Or as the methadone tapers down each day, if she’s continuing to use fentanyl (even VERY small amounts), will her body just demand her to up her fentanyl use again to compensate?

Again, I’m REALLY sorry for the long post.. we just really need help. We’ve both been doing a lot of crying the last few days. We were so set on going to the clinic and beating this together, and it’s so heartbreaking that it didn’t work out. I get that it’s a liability issue for them, but they could’ve checked with the pharmacy to see she hasn’t picked up in months, and that her urine was clean besides the fent.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6770785}"

I live on the east coast and was sober for over 5 years. In my time of sobriety a lot changed with the dope, ie it all being fent. Nowadays. That said I read all the horror stories about suboxone  induction. I read a lot about the Bernese method and decided to give that a try. The first couple of days seemed fine and tonight I upped my sub dose too much and it put me in precipitated withdrawal. I’ve had this happen to me a few times in the past and each time it was horrible but short lived. 
Tonight I began feeling pw’s and decided to finish my stash to make the symptoms dissipate.   It wasn’t much, about two bags and it barely helped. Now this is where I am not too sure. In the past I would usually ride it out and continue taking suboxone and I would go on with my detox. Also past experiences with pw’s were usually caused with larger doses of sub. Tonight my sub dose was .5 (second of the day). Given that I still did quite a bit of dope today and such a small dose of sub caused the precipitation I was wondering what to do. 

I feel that if I take subs tomorrow in a small dose I will prob be ok if I continue to taper dope, but I’m wondering how much fent has been pushed off the receptors. At some point (already feeling a lot better, but still a lil shitty) I will transition from pw’s to good old fashioned wd’s. Will i be able to do a full transition to just subs or am I at risk of pw’s again. Judging by today, I know I will be okay with 1mg total sub but what happens if I need a larger dose.

2021-08-12 23:32:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/p3fh4h/7_weeks_methadone_free/,7 weeks methadone free!,"So 7 weeks ago as of yesterday I took my last dose of methadone. I did switch to a low dose of Subutex (4mg a day), because the first time I detoxed off of methadone it didn’t go well and I started using again and had ~2-3 month full relapse on fentanyl where I ended up using pretty much daily again. While I’m in a better place mentally now, I still plan to stay on MAT indefinitely, but now I just FaceTime my doctor every 1-2 months and no longer have to deal with the clinic bullshit, and get a prescription for 30 days. I feel so free now, and proud that I have come this far!

Choosing to taper off of methadone was a personal choice (for a plethora of reasons, the main one being that I was sick of the side effects), but by no means do I regret being on it. For a long time methadone worked for me because it was a major tool that allowed me to get my life back. I have a great husband (who’s also a wonderful, hands-on father), a beautiful son who is about to turn 2, and we own a home in a great neighborhood outright. I definitely still have a ways to go in terms of financial stability, but my husband has a good job and I plan to start a year-long coding course that hopefully will result in getting a good job soon enough!

The first few weeks were difficult but being on Subutex some other medication for anxiety and ADHD (I also was taking clonodine, gabapentin, and a non-narcotic muscle relaxer for about the first few weeks) has really helped. I have been taking the same dose of Valium for about 4 years now, and while I know benzos aren’t right for everyone, I was a person who got on dope to self-medicate nearly lifelong struggles with depression and anxiety. Someday I hope to be off benzos too but I believe in “easy does it.” One thing at a time. However, I did stop smoking cigarettes after I left detox and am now using a vape with a low amount of nicotine just here and there.

I feel so “free” and better than I have ever felt, physically and emotionally, in a long time. I am in therapy, and while I don’t do NA/AA (because of their stances on MAT), I have kept myself in connection with other addicts in recovery for positive support. I’ve also chatted with a couple strangers regularly here on Reddit who are also in the early stages of recovery. It feels good to encourage and offer any advice I have to others, and it’s helped me stay clean too.

I did relapse and use ~2 weeks after being off methadone and about 1 week after I came home from detox. I went to detox for 10 days after I stopped methadone because even though I had switched to Subutex it was still difficult. I used one time, and did less than half of what I was used to doing before (snorting fentanyl), and I fell out. But by the good grace of God or the Universe (who really knows), I “came to”/woke up, and I’m still here and going. I feel so good and I haven’t even had cravings in a long time now, for me. And if they come… so be it. Living life sober and happy is better than addiction. Fuck getting high, I’d rather live a long and good life. Family, good health, and the “small stuff” in life matters so much more. And those small things add up to amazing returns. Not even the best “highs” from drugs ever add up to anything good. At this point I know that much.

It was oxys and our dealer at the time will front us up to 1k worth of pills and we pay him whenever we can. He cut us off when he found out we started doing fent. One night, I was at work and i just felt so unease. Something's not right. I kept calling my bf just to chat. I never felt the need to do that. He came in to my work to eat and to drop off my dope. I saw him just high af with our other friend. I was so worried that I kept calling him until my shift end. The last 45min til I got home was nerve wrecking cause he stopped answering my phone calls. I get home and I go straight to the room and his body was blocking our bedroom door. I knew he OD'ed. I was mad at myself cause he dropped me off the same amount at work but when I went to do mine, it slipped out of my hand and I wasn't able to save a lot of it on top of that, why couldn't I shed one tear for the love of my life? Why didn't I die with him that night?

Fast forward. A few Years. Was clean for 3yrs straight. But it happened. Something I thought was gone forever, it was reignited and I remembered how much I loved this drug. I was back. This time, she would give me free pills if I sell the ones she wants to make money off of. I'll buy those and get my free ones. I never liked xanax by itself but man, one day, I accidentally mixed oxy and xans and I knew, that's what I want to feel ALL THE TIME. Well, fast forward, I now am waiting a trial for a DUI and I am on methadone and I still am waiting for the day I no longer crave for these things. Btw, before methadone, I started doing H/fent for just a little under a year. 

I've been on methadone for 6 months and haven't done anything else ever since. It is helping me. But the craving is still there and I am just over taking methadone. I just wanna wake up one day and not worry about these things. I feel so fuckiing defeated. I am on 130mg everyday. I bought 15 xans because I am debating about stopping methadone CT. 

Is this a good idea? What will happen if I just jump off from 130 MG CT with comfort meds? How long will it last? I just wanna be done man. I'm so done battling myself that I am on my knees crying just asking for some help. Anything. I'm scared every day. I have MDD, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD. I am suicidal and I'm scared of my own self.

I didn’t start abusing until December of 2020 and that was recreational. I knew opioids felt good because I have been in a severe car accident when I was younger. 

I take them for a week or two. Then stop. No WDs, I am ashamed to admit I didn’t know you could withdraw from opioids. 

April of this year my whole world turned even more upside down. My divorce finalized and my ex left. I because a 100% single mom. I had a stressful job, and emotionally taxing job. I had just gone through a break up with someone I loved, but who unfortunately was moving. 

The small precious me time I had as a single mom to a two year old vanished. I was constantly on. Work, school, baby. We managed thrived even. If you saw my house my car, you’d probably think I’m a clean freak. 

No one knows I abuse but it won’t be secret long. I had started to miss meetings, doctors appointments (for myself never my son). I wasn’t engaged and present. 

I had almost and endless access to pharma meds. And from June of this year until now I have hardly gone a day without taking something. 

I was so dangerous and incautious with what I was taken. My best quests is 90-120mg of percs and 90 mg of oxy. 

I admit I feel very stupid but I didn’t even know you could withdraw from pharm pills. 

It’s been 24 hours since I had anything but I had been tapering dozing a bit. I can’t tell if I’m over the worst or about to endure hell. 

I’m so scared. I’m scared I’m going to lose everything. I’m scared because I can’t talk about it. No one know. No one. 

I have to work. I made it through call last night and even managed a bit of dreamless sleep with liquid Ativan. I plan on using that as little as possible. I am praying this withdraw to be short since I didn’t use that long in the scheme of things. I am mostly just feeling bleh in this moment. But I also see that my toldrance rose insanely fast and I’m wondering how much of that me putting myself in danger. Two weeks ago I had an incident and when I checked my O2 when I woke up it was 77.

It started off recreational, and has spiraled into full blown addiction. I have always enjoyed recreational drug use, but this is next level out of control. I have been blowing my savings on the bullshit & if I don’t use the withdrawals make me want to tear my skin off. I have tried going cold turkey a few times but my personal best is 36 hrs & then I caved. I use about 4-6 pressed MBox pills a day. I set an appointment for Monday at a suboxone clinic and I just had a few questions for you guys. I’m guessing a few of you have dealt with this particular demon monkey on your back.

1. Does anybody have a link/can they explain to me the proper burnese induction technique? Should I taper my usage beforehand? I know you start with something like .25 suboxone and work your way up from there. 

2. Do most suboxone clinics make you go every day to get your suboxone dose or are they willing to send you home with a supply? (I live like 30 min away from the clinic so it would be convenient if I didn’t have to burn that much gas in my truck every day).

3. Do the clinics require you to take the dose at the clinic or can you take it home?

4. Is it possible to just stay on suboxone for 2 or 3 weeks max and jump off? I don’t really wanna have to be on it for that long, it’s more of a means to an end. I’d rather go back to taking kratom.

5. Does suboxone give you a buzz at all or does it just take away withdrawal symptoms. Does it take away all of the symptoms or just most?

Thanks in advance, I’ve already let this drug take enough away from me. I’d like to be done with it before I pay a steeper price than the few thousand I have already blown on it such as my relationship with my beautiful wife, or possibly even my life.

Well, I started the subs after a little more than 36 hours from my last oxy dose and it didn't cause PWD's. So here's my sub taper

Day1: 2 mg in the day, 1 mg at night. Still felt like shit after 2 mg so I popped some at night.

Day 2: same

Day 3: Only 2 mg in the morning.

Day 4: Only 1 mg in the morning.

Day 5: 1 mg in the morning. 1 mg at night bc I felt like shit.

Day 6: 1 mg in the morning.

Day 7: Felt slight withdrawal, loose stool, like of apetite/energy so I took 1 mg in the morning.

Day 8: 0.5 mg in the morning. I had to take a little today, I was feeling slight withdrawal as in very loose stool, upset stomach, lack of apetite/energy. I had old friends that said they were coming in town today, so I took just enough suboxone to keep from withdrawal.

Day 9: Now 24 hours from my last tiny dose. Slight withdrawal: Loose stool, turning stomach but not too bad, loss of apetite, and energy. Very slight hot flashes/chills.  Overall very mild symptoms, almost feels too good to be true. A little depressed but not that bad.

Day 10: Same as yesterday in terms of withdrawal symptoms. The withdrawal symptoms aren't that bad, nothing at all compared to a cold turkey. I'm experiencing like only 25% the severity of a cold turkey withdrawal. My main only concerns about the withdrawal is no energy, lack of apetite, and mild chills. I'm not even waking up in sweats, although I was sweating a lot while on the sub taper, like a lot of sweat. I'm not even having diarrhea, just moderately loose stool. I've done the same sub rapid taper before but only for 6 days of subs, and I was withdrawing from a fent habit that was much heavier, I needed like 120 mg of pharmaceutical oxy at that time to get a nod but I was mostly taking fent 30's and would sometimes take oxy, whereas now I only need 90 mg. Yet, even after the sub taper at that time I still had bad withdrawals, nothing like cold turkey, but my stomach was a volcano constantly erupting and had intense mood swings and intense diarrhea for a week. Right now though, I feel so much better than that withdrawal. No diarrhea whatsoever.

Either this sub rapid taper is amazing, or I have subs built up in my system and will have sub withdrawal starting day 3 or 4. We'll see. I've taken subs before for like 3-4 days at similar amounts as described above, and always had withdrawal at the 36-48 hour mark, so I truly believe this is all the withdrawal I'll experience. 

This feels too good to be true. These symptoms I'm experiencing are so mild, either this sub taper is magical, or I did subs for too long and will soon experience suboxone withdrawal, which apparently starts on day 4.

Everything from ketamine and mdma to Xanax and oxycodone to heroin and crack, I’ve broke free from the cycle of self destruction I couldn’t stop repeating. 

Within them 5 years the longest I managed to stay sober for was 7/8 days. I had two seizures from withdrawal (January 2019 & June 2020), multiple overdose scares and suicide attempts, became homeless 3 times, lost 95% of my friends and 100% of my personality. Every single one of my thoughts were drug-orientated and everyday I was just looking for a high. Most days I would only eat a sandwich and just consume drugs. I went from 64kg to 52kg in about a year and a half. 

Heroin wasn’t a problem for me until December 2020. Everyday from December-June(4th) I was smoking heroin. Thankfully I finally managed to stop benzos after a 7 month (fairly quick) taper, on the 20th April 2021. Around this time I also decided to stop things like ketamine and mdma (which I wasn’t taking too often anyway). In my opinion it was easier to stop everything else because I was hooked on heroin and it completely took over my life very quickly, so as long as I had heroin (and crack a lot of the time) I was fine. The more I realised what was happening to me with heroin the more depressed I became. 

At the end of May 2021 my nan gave me the option to move 100 miles away with her and essentially ‘start fresh’. High as fuck and positive about stopping, I took the chance. I moved far away to a place I had access to nothing, with a really strict family that would supervise me constantly. Its an addicts nightmare! 

To cut a long story short(er), it’s now been 68 days completely clean from opiates (and everything else) and 113 days off benzos! I now weigh 61kg and I feel ‘normal’ again. If anyone is wondering, yes I stopped the heroin cold turkey, in my opinion it’s the best and quickest way. 

I hope I’ve gave some of you inspiration with my story. I want to add as well, I have no withdrawal symptoms at all now and this whole process was 10000% worth it. Best decision I’ve ever made.

So I have been taking 300mg of codeine phosphate, usually in one hit nearly every day for the past few months. I know that's not great but been unwilling to confront it till now. I also know it's pretty stupid but I've always been fine and my tolerance has built up over the years and I was very much in control.
Now I seem to have symptoms of a toxicity overload and I'm trying to stop. Yes I do crave it but it's more the abdominal pains, sleepless nights, fatigue and chills. I'm presuming this is all part of it? No one but myself knows about this, I'm too afraid to speak to my doctor because I developed my codeine dependency after a ketamine addiction. I also had someone crash their car into me so really rely on pain medication to deal with the pain. I'm wondering if I should just speak to my doctor and risk losing my pain medication or just persevere.
 I'm nearly two days without it and I'm wrapped up and freezing in bed but no fever. Should I have a bit to help or just go cold turkey?

Any help would be huge as I'm very alone in this and have a lot to lose in personal and professional life if it spills out.

I relapsed in May bc my cousin died, and a close childhood friend died, both really bc of heroin or alcohol. On top of chronic pain, I just couldn't get it off my mind. I retore a hip labrum and was in bad pain again, couldn't really go out or do anything and fell into deep depression bc my life is just stuck in a bed. So I relapsed for a week, needed the mental space, and boom my body was dependent again. Decided to go on a bender for a few months bc my mind was too fucked to be sober. I'm having my surgery in a few weeks, and hope to have my pain taken care of and can live a more normal life.

I just did a rapid suboxone taper for 1 week, it's day 8 and I didn't take anything today but do not believe I'm experiencing full withdrawal, my stomach is queezy and feeling off mentally but nothing too crazy, so I believe I still have a little subs in my system.

For example, I was taking 80-120mg per day between through April, May, July. Then I quit with the help of kratom and some other comfort meds.

I ended up finding half an 80 in a jacket pocket about 6 days later and couldn’t overcome the temptation. I didn’t fall back into my habit straight away but I was able to score some more a few days later and once again I’m back on 80-120mg per day. 

I try again, same recovery method, and end up clean for 15 days, feeling pretty good and certainly over any severe PAWS. Just cravings. 

But then an opportunity comes up to buy 14x 80s for a really cheap price. My stupid addict brain makes the purchase and 2 weeks later here I am, out of opiates and ready to try and get clean again.

I intend to give it a good go - I really do - but there’s this part of me that just doesn’t want to quit. On a macro level, I know I need to, I can’t keep this up, it’s no way to live. I don’t need to go into details about the reasons why on here - I’m sure we can all relate! But on a micro level some part of me still wants it. 

I feel like even if I get 2 weeks clean…2 months clean…whatever, if the opportunity arises I will end up buying more oxy and I’ll be back in this vicious cycle. Even if I’m sober and feeling pretty physically and mentally well I’m still always thinking about being high, scrolling my phone thinking of ways I can source and buy oxy etc.

I know MAT is an option. But for personal reasons (my partner doesn’t know I’m currently using, I don’t want opiate abuse on my medical record, I don’t want to end up on subs for years etc.) I don’t think this is feasible.

Of course therapy is another solution. And trust me I’ve paid for a lot of therapy for all sorts of reasons over the years but when it comes to addiction I just can’t crack it.

I’d certainly consider myself a “functional” addict and lead a pretty regular life. But I’m just sick of this now. It’s just fucking boring. It’s boring being in active addiction. It’s boring being in recovery. It’s certainly boring being sober and craving that high constantly.

I guess I’m rambling now but I just feel like I need to vent. Thanks for reading lol.

Anyone else share this sort of experience?

This doctor didn't care to talk to me about anything other than trying to get me onto suboxone. When I said no that wasn't really something I was looking for right now as I feel after 12 days I've been through the worst of the withdrawal and I don't want to be dependent on anything again. My main symptoms right now are lack of sleep, anxiety and no energy. She tells me ""well I can almost guarantee you will relapse."" I said ""well thanks but again it's not something I'm looking for right now."" And she just starts reading statistics like 90% of people who don't use treatment relapse and this many overdose because when they relapse they don't have a tolerance like before and over do it. Even tried enticing me by saying well it will get rid of your withdrawal symptoms, which actually did spark my interest for a quick second. And then she suggested that I go get myself a naloxone kit. Basically when I said no for probably a third time to the suboxone she just wanted me off the phone. Told me if I change my mind I can call asked if there was anything else and when I said no hung up. Afterwards I was really angry the more I thought about that interaction. It just seemed like she was only there to get you on suboxone and if you weren't interested in that than she had no time for you. She was a fucking drug pusher. And I know suboxone is a miracle for some people but I just couldn't understand why she wouldn't respect my feelings of wanting to do this on my own.

Well I take prescriptions nsaids and a biologic injection to maintain chronic pain from an autoimmune illness. I had to stop taking my meds for a week before and a week after the procedure. I was miserable. In so much pain, I could barely get out of bed. The addict deep down inside me justified buying dirty 30s because “pain justifies this”. Well I’m an idiot. Those were gone in 3 days- I bought 8 of them. I had zero opiate tolerance but fuck it right? Next thing I know, I’m buying a gram of fentanyl and shooting up in my bathroom to “kill the pain”.

Wasn’t easy and not 100% out of the woods but exercising lifting weights and hiking with my dog specifically helps, eating hearty not necessarily healthy meals thou vegetables and fruit go a long way for sure, been taking B12 Vitamin C & D, soaking in the sun is huge, guided meditations at night I love, and yes I enjoy THC and found indica edibles certainly help relax and at very least can combat any random thoughts of depression. I dealt with cold sweats, Restless leg my nemesis!, no sleep, slight diarrhea, yawning, sneezing, and overall feelings of 💩💩💩. But if you feel down don’t our health is the number one thing we have in life it’s never too late to address it.

I went in and did the beginning of the assessment with a counselor and was accepted. I brought up that Iv been on benzos since 2014 and and am working with a doctor on a taper with diazepam and drop down to 20mg a day in the next couple weeks. I will drop 5mg every month. 
She told me as long as I bring the bottle tomorrow this won’t count against me. Do you guys think this will mess with me getting up to a needed dosage of Methadone?  Iv been an fent user for over a year and combine alcohol and benzos with it everyday and somehow by the grace of god am still here.
Also, finding a doctor to taper me off benzos was extremely hard. And I’m wondering if the clinic is going to call him to talk about my treatment. I feel horrible because he has done so much to help me when no one else would and I was using opiates without telling him. Do you think the clinic doc will call him? And do you think my benzo doc will drop me? I feel so guilty. I’m not even that worried about getting cut off but more so disappointing him. He never drug tested me or anything. I’m almost certain since I’m down to 25 from 60 my HIV specialist will finish my taper for me as he doesn’t want me on opiates and he’s a very liberal script writer.

So I’ve been on subs for a little over a year. Trying to slowly lower and get out, but needed the consistency and accountability to stay clean. However lately I’ve been feeling like I want to get off only so I can get high again every “once in awhile” like a normal non-addict can. I don’t want to admit that I have a fault and want to be able to experience the fun times I used to have, but responsibly. I know this isn’t the right mindset and that it’s never responsible or safe. I get that I’ll always have the monkey trying to crawl back on my back. I’m scared that I’ll never be able to get off because of these thoughts.  Seriously, the main reason I stay on the subs is because it makes feeling the effects of opiates extremely less to none. Uhg, it just sucks to still not feel free after all this time. What the hell is wrong with me?  The MAT program I’m in costs me $50/mo with aid included and that’s just another reason I want out, but I feel like if I did get off them I just know one day I’ll crack and use again. 

Also lost my girlfriend to lack of long term love and she was definitely crucial to my recovery thus far so I feel very vulnerable right now. She brought up that I might not be capable of long term relationships due to my addictive personality and looking for those rushes such as the chase of new and exciting flings.

A little back story, 

I’ve been addicted to opiates for 7 years, I watched my best friend fall deeper and deeper until he did the unthinkable and I had to carry his casket, that drove me and the rest of my friends to fight for sobriety. I got on Methadone shortly thereafter and have been on the program for 5 years. 

60mg was my dose and that was plenty for me. My DOC was Oxy IR 20s or 10s and would do about 400mg a day. 

I could miss a day here and a day there on the methadone and it got to the point my doc sat me down and said maybe it’s time to start thinking about the end goal. My doctor dropped me from 60-40 in one go. 33.3% gone, I didn’t even notice it. From 40 I went 2mg every two weeks down to 20, and from 20 I went 1mg a month to 1. I really tried to do this shit right, taking breaks when my body told me too.

40 hours ago was my last dose of one mg when I had been taking for two weeks, and I haven’t had one withdrawal symptoms yet. I’ve been poolside all day kicking it under the sun.

I know there’s a stigma about how shitty the program is but it’s been a blessing for me. It let me finish my engineering degree, get my own apartment and start a real life. 

I’m excited for the days to come. Hell I even embrace it now. Has anyone else had a similar experience coming off the program?

It's keeping me up at night, and overall making me scared for the coming days.

This subreddit is a great source of support the past month for me, congrats to all working on sobriety as it is a tough challenge. I had a daily PST habit for about the past year and a half, and decided in July to get off it it. I’m currently at day 12 completely clean, and have just been taking kratom daily to manage and stay functional and in a good mood. (About 3g 3x/day) Does anyone have some insight into how long it takes until overall mood and brain chemistry levels out? The kratom keeps me feeling pretty good throughout the day, and it is only in the morning once it has worn off since my evening dose I feel very depressed and pessimistic, I would analogize it to straight up depression where the world just seems like an oppressive force. I know it’s just the lack of OP talking as my mood increases significantly after my morning kratom dose, I would just like to hear some stories of other peoples experience at this stage and how soon their natural system felt like it leveled out. Fortunately I have no cravings, my only discontent is feeling sad and lethargic for which the kratom is a temporary band-aid until my body heals. I’ve been doing light exercise, visiting with friends and going outside along with working each day and eating well which I assume should also help get me back on track. Good luck to all in your endeavors, no matter where you’re at right now you should feel good there are others who empathize with you and wish you well!

Once I get to 20 mg, I will be meeting with the doctor to go down 2 mg at a time instead of 5.

It has been a hot minute since I have actually dealt with opiate withdrawals and every time I tried to get sober, it felt like I had completely forgotten just how bad withdrawals really are. The last time was so painful that I had to get into treatment just to deal. I have a chronic pain condition which makes withdrawals oodles of more fun.

I'm healthier than ever. I finally have money saved up. I've got a great job, my manager and team love me, I've gotten every raise possible for the time I've been here. I've stayed away from drugs, I don't even smoke weed anymore, I don't drink, never failed a drug screen at my clinic. I've  been a good girl. Zero connection to my old life, I don't associate with any of the people I used to, I have moved, etc. Basically what I'm saying is that outside of the methadone world, I am 100% stable and ready to get off. Stable housing, mental health, job, etc. I waited to start decreasing until I hit my stability goals and then some, so I am more than ready to deal with what is coming.

What I want to know is what to expect/prepare for. I've never gone through methadone withdrawals. I know that they last longer than fent and H, but it has been a hot minute since I have actually felt withdrawal. I've been on a relatively low dose of methadone, so it isn't like I'm coming down from 100+ (and bless you if you are). 

- I have a wonderful PCP that cares about me and is willing to help me by prescribing medications or recommending vitamins to take during this time. Is there anything that you have been prescribed to make your withdrawls a bit more manageable?

- I've heard a month is about what I should be expecting regarding wd symptoms once I am at 0 mg. Any comments on that?

- Is there anything you used outside of medication to help make you more comfortable? (Ex. Natural fiber sheets, specific foods, etc.)

- At what dose did you really start getting uncomfortable? I have PTO that I'll be able to use if/when things become painful for me and while my manager is a total sweetheart, I like to give as much notice as possible which is hard to do when every day is different during wds and I can't just go ""I'll be unable to get out of bed in exactly 6 weeks"" lol. Just looking for what dose I should expect things to get rough. My clinic has told me 15-20 mg.

Good green vitality powder supplement from nuzest, this shit rocks has a full vital mineral profile and getting that nutrition boost really helps ya get through it.

Also a laundry list of nootropics, nooept, bacopa moneri, some racetams. Proper nutrition and sunlight have been essential, I use creatine and N-acetyl cystine daily to boost physical performance and eat pretty clean now. Also cutting down on masturbating too much (really fucking demotivating, our base biological drive is to reproduce, once your body thinks that's done, what's what's point in doing anything else? may as well sit and get high...)

Most importantly, reaching out for help, reconnecting with myself, friends and family and going to councilling regularly.

I thought I was a goner, i had a few nights towards the end of my habit where i was sure my breathing was gonna stop, i was gonna OD again and this time id be alone, thats the point where I decided to turn it around.

When I was 23 (circa 2011) I started to experience what I thought was severe back pain.  I went to my GP hoping for a narcotic. I can't remember why I felt I needed/wanted that, but I did. That didn't happen, at first. First he put me on a muscle relaxer which didn't do a thing for the constant dull pain in my back.  I called my doctors office a couple days later, telling them the med wasn't working. My doctor said he would call something else in for me. Now, this was a Friday morning and he doesn't work weekends. Per usual with this doctor he forgets to call anything in. At this point I'm standing inside the pharmacy at 5:30pm and I remember telling myself there was no way I was going another weekend in pain. I ended up calling the doctors exchange and quickly received a call back from another doctor. Told him what was going on and he asked what my doctor was going to call in. Without missing a beat I said Hydrocodone! Since this was before the big DEA crackdown on prescription narcotics the other doc said ok, and called in a script for it. That's how it began.

I'll save you the story of the hell I went through mentally, but I was taking (8) 10/325 narcos a day. That's 240 a month for reference! I still remember the day I decided I had to quit. It was when I seriously considered stealing money from my family to support my addiction. I was extremely lucky that my new doctor decided to taper me off with Tramadol. Remember back in 2014 tramadol was not a controlled substance.  It worked, it took away the pain until I was able to see a pain management specialist and figure out alternatives to treating pain. Got off the tramadol a year later and haven't touched an opiate since.

The eye opening thing is about 3-4 months ago I decided to see a psychiatrist because my ADD symptoms had finally gotten to the point I needed medication. I was 100% honest with my shrink, and told her everything about my past, including the substance abuse. I wanted her to know right up front I wasn't looking for a stimulant (Adderall/Ritalin) because those are a schedule II controlled substance. She had me try a non-stimulant medication but unfortunately it wasn't working. At our follow up appointment I told her this, thinking she'd prescribe another non-stimulant. To my surprise, she actually recommended I try Adderall. I reminded her again of my past substance abuse issues and she said something so simple, yet so earth shattering. She said that my substance abuse was most likely a symptom of untreated ADD/bipolar 2. Apparently there are a bunch of studies that show people who don't medicate their ADD/ADHD are 65% more likely to develop substance abuse issues. She assured me she would monitor my use of the Adderall carefully and switch to something else if I felt myself slipping. 

I hesitantly filled the prescription and started taking them as prescribed. I was shocked when the meds didn't make me gitty, jittery, or euphoric. After all, that's why people abuse adderall and sell it on the street.  Come to find out if you really need adderall (aka you really do have ADD/ADHD) the pill does the exact opposite. It calmed my mind and I actually took a nap the first time I took it. I've been on the Adderall for a couple months now and I'm already positive I won't become mentally addicted to this like I did opiates. In fact I actually have excess pills at the end of the month because sometimes I don't feel the need to take them on the weekends.

Anyway, so sorry for the long post but here is what I hope you take away from it:
1. No matter how deep your addiction is, it is beatable, I promise.
2. If you are struggling with substance abuse see if it could be a symptom of something else. There's no way of knowing if I would have medicated my ADD sooner, I wouldn't have become an addict. But research is strongly leaning that way.

Overall, I feel great after tapering to .4mg of subs over months. I’m using lyrica, flexeril, ketamine rx and klonopin rx.

lyrica - 300mg everyday, will taper off now 
Flexeril - I use two 10mg a day for rls and night 
Ketamine -  I use for the depression and anxiety, tapering down today. 
Klonopin - I take one daily for years so I upped to three to get some sleep also tapered.

The RLS the first 4 days is brutal but after that not bad at all. I attribute a lot of the good feelings to ketamine. It might not be forever but I don’t need to use although I want to as most people would. Ketamine acts weird on the receptors, no opiate high and just sedation to cal myself. I take 20-50mg inter-nasal. Will taper myself off that as well all before day 10.

This isn’t probably what you want to hear but I’m done with the life and need to move on. 

And I’m moving, cut all ties and starting fresh. I hope this helped someone at least, if not a rant isn’t bad 🤷🏽‍♂️",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43999037}"

I used mainly prescription co-codamol 30/500 on and off over the years without withdrawals as it was very short term/sporadic over the years. However over the last couple of months I started using every day, taking up to 12 pills a day. Believe me, I know this is probably small fish compared to the addictions that others suffer from and I’m lucky to have realised my problem sooner rather than later.

So I quit CT and my last dose was Wednesday 21st July. By Thursday the WD started. I was hit with panic, shakes, cold sweats, lava shits, depression, loss of appetite and just generally feeling like I wanted to die or use again to stop the WD. But I knew that if I used again I would just need to go through all of this again so I persevered. 
The physical withdrawals lasted about a week before beginning to ease and I finally started turning a corner. I never want to use again.
Now I’m day 12 and although I don’t have cravings and have no intention in using again, the anxiety and feeling really low is starting to really get to me.  It’s like all of the joy and happiness I had left my body when the codeine did.
I’m usually such a happy, positive person and feeling like this is awful.
I still have the odd bit of diarrhoea but I think it’s the anxiety causing this as opposed to WD.
I’m already on Zoloft for anxiety and “low mood” after a breakdown last year and don’t want to take any other medication.
Currently I take Zoloft, propranolol (when needed) vitamin c and vitamin d.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m so happy with how I have managed to stay away from the codeine and I am still functional and going to work etc. BUT, does anyone know how long it normally takes to go back to feeling like me mentally? 
Have I totally fucked myself with this addiction? I exercise, meditate etc to try and help but still have the lingering anxiety and feeling down/joyless. Is this just my life now? Or did anyone else have the mental side effects of W/d and have them eventually go away?
As I say, I don’t want to take more medication and weed negatively affects me because of my anxiety so that’s out of the question unfortunately.

.
Today, I’m missing a WHOLE damn molar and it shows when I smile. That’s how far I was willing to go. At one point my doctor caught on to my constant complaints and injuries and she stopped prescribing my requested medication. 
.
Soooo... I ended up going to my dentist and I complained of a nonexistent toothache in my mouth. He went ahead and wrote a prescription for pain meds as I requested. But when I went back he said he couldn’t continue to write the Rx and the best thing that I could do was have the tooth extracted. I knew that if I were to go to an oral surgeon and have this tooth extracted I would then for sure get another prescription for at least a couple months. At least I was HOPING🤞 I could get a couple of months worth of meds.
.
So I agreed to have my tooth extracted. My dentist gave me a referral and I took it  to the oral surgeon & scheduled my appointment for the very next day. I told her that I was in a lot of pain and that this was a “medical emergency”. The next day I went in they put me under general anesthesia and I woke up with super swollen cheeks and a big hole in my mouth. 
.
Guess what? I got my pain meds and to me that was a big win. I couldn’t eat anything solid for about a week but I really didn’t care as long as I had my fix. I then exaggerated the post-op pain and the discomfort for as long as I could until the oral surgeon finally stopped writing my refill.
.
Looking back now, in retrospect, that was just flat out crazy. And I have many stories similar to this one.
.
Listen... I know I complain a LOT about the depression and cognitive issues I occasionally suffer from now as a result of my long term drug abuse... but honestly I am SO thankful for how far I’ve come. I’m just happy that I’m no longer a slave to my addiction. Will I ever feel 100% normal again? IDK. But I’m optimistic. Each passing day, week and month it gets better and better. 
.
Getting clean and fighting thru PAWS was 100% worth it and I’d do it all over again if it meant being where I am today. It DOES get easier.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37810105}"

I'm definitely through the worst, but have:

1. Work tomorrow

2. A trip in a few days where I need high energy

Thankfully, I have a full blown arsenal: 

-tons of benzos

-a few 8mb subs 

-enough energy to go get kratom

-pedialyte 

I took an 8mg sub day 3 (did jack shit) and a half day 4, another half today. I don't feel like they're doing anything though.

Thoughts on how to continue? Main issue now is sleep, back pain, eating, energy, and how insanely boring it is to sit at home all day. Thanks a ton in advance.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.663253}"

My name is Ethan. I've been in recovery for 8 months now and have been in and out of addiction. I used to share on Reddit almost every day of my struggles. You guys helped me get to 63 days where I was then brought back into active addiction by a relapse. In these months without reddits I ended up totaling two cars in one day off percs(my drug of choice) and overdosing a few times on Xanax. Also spent 30 days in rehab. I finally feel ready to change. After all, I'm putting everything on the line. For me not to be clean and sober would mean a 6-month facility and a complete change of school systems. Now, this isn't what is keeping me sober but is hopefully something to be able to think about before relapse. Right now I have 48 days clean and 109 days off the percs. Even though I feel like I have so long off the percs(longest ever) they are still the thing I constantly desire. I am on naltraxone. Which makes it easier to not use them knowing that I would essentially feel nothing and it would be a waste of money and considered a relapse. But, I'm hanging in there and with all of your support, I'm feeling really good about it. I'm also getting back on my sobriety website and promoting that to share with addicts all over the world.

Still a bit of depression spurts for no reason but nothing a dab can temporarily fix. 2 days in a row solid poops, I've taken Imodium everyday tho scared to stop 😂.  Feeling hopeful.

Tommorow is my first day alone, and I work from home so that will be a bit weird. Still a bit nervous to drive but I feel my cognitive stuff has almost settled, feel more on top of it. I've had no craving for blues really but for reason craving xans. Probably cause I know it will help with the last of my withdrawal, but I know now I can't touch pills again even if I was able to not get addicted to Xanax. I opened Pandora's Box that month of using and it can't be closed, so I'm forever gonna need to be over cautious.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45060468}"

Fighting a relapse,"Hey guys i’m reaching out here because i currently have no where else to go. I’m a recovering opiate addict and by the grace of god have almost 6 months completely sober. I spent 3 of those months in residential rehab, and moved out of town to a sober house as my only way to stay clean. I’ve been grinding the 12 steps. I’ve got a sponsor and a homegroup. I’m checking all the boxes. I’ve been pretty on fire for recovery this whole process. Logically i know that if i go back out i will die. I’ve come far enough in my recovery to make visits to my home town and be able to turn down weed and alcohol. 

However in my last visit home when i was by myself in my room i stumbled upon a small plastic baggie tucked away in the last place i would’ve expected. I picked it up to throw away and in it i see a blue Oxy 30. Must’ve lost it a long time ago. I didn’t react how i had hoped that i would. Instead of being disgusted, i felt cravings more powerful than i’ve ever experienced in my sobriety. The devil is making it so easy for me. It’s basically a freebee. In my addiction i wouldve done it automatically without choice. this time i’ve at the least delayed myself. i stood over the toilet begging myself to just flush it but something in me wasn’t strong enough to do what i knew was right. it was the last day of my home visit so i negotiated with myself. i didnt have the strength to get rid of the pill but i DID have the strength to stay sober Just for Today! i hid the pill and decided at least i would leave it there so i could have time to meditate on it before i make an impulsive decision. 

I’m coming back home in a week from now. That Roxy 30 has been playing in my mind daily. i keep catching myself being consumed in the thoughts of planning my relapse. I have felt so sick with myself this week and probably due yo the situation. I don’t want to call my sponsor or tell my roomates out of fear of accountability (ironic right?). im so scared im gonna do something i regret but am currently feeling powerless. i dont know what im gonna do. 

not sure if im looking for advice or just needed to put my struggle into words. regardless replies are appreciated.
