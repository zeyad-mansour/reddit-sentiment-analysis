I was a polydrugaddict (my english is not good as i speak spanish but i think i learnt some English at School and Internet years ago).

Was, and i'm for the rest of my life an addict to opiates mostly the last 6 or 7 years. specifically morphine/fentanyl iv/im

2 - 3 months ago i asked for help. I see a psychiatrist, a toxicologist and a psychologist many times per week.

I am currently taking 5mg of methadone (very low dose), gabapentin 150mg (low dose), lorazepam 2,5mg (not low but not high dose i think) and my psych added me the last week Prometazine 25mg to reduce latency of sleep and if it works to  avoid a neuroleptic. Thats my daily intake. Gabapentin and Prometazine was added some days ago.

At this time i am fellin good, better each day, i'm working and styding. For me its a miracle that is working, and i'm feeling comfortable because if i have any cravings my doctors told me i can go to Toxicology ER 24hs/365days, so if i think i crave for opioids or something, they'll help me. luckily I have not needed to resort to them because I have not had cravings and i'm good with the RXs.

i now i'm not clean because the meds isn't clean, but is better than ratter be injecting thinks.

i'm happy, deppresion was gone, i'm styding since the last month and each day i feel better. 

Time ago i though i will be dead at this time, but now i can think in the future i have.

For the last time!

I’m getting married tomorrow. Come November it will have been 7 years since a syringe punctured my arm or heroin entered my system. I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting lately, thinking back to the days I spent being my 3-time-DUI drug dealers chauffeur as a senior in high school, driving him to North Philly and the laundromat and Best Buy and Harrahs casino in Chester, spending upwards of 12 hours in my car as an 18 year old at a rate of one bag an hour. When I went to college as a freshman, I went through my first bout of WDs in a dorm room with no A/C, vowing to change my life and quit, which lasted 4 days. I’d go home every weekend to get high, and fell out in that dealers apartment. He didn’t call 911, but he slapped me around and poured enough water on me so that I woke up. Said I started turning blue. He convinced me to quit. When I would return to heroin he was in jail, so my cost of time+gas money for dope dried up. Over the next 6 months I would do everything under the sun but dope - Xanax, MDMA, Adderall, lots and lots of LSD, coke, and anything else I could find, with at least a bowl or two of weed a day. I started committing more to my relationship with alcohol and ended up getting arrested twice in two weeks. Returned to the weed, and on 4/20/2013, went into a psychosis that did not go away with the high. I ended up in the psych ward twice in a month’s span and was in psychosis an additional month and a half before getting the right medication, which I still take to this day. 

I fell out again in a friends house when I returned to heroin. Again, he didn’t call 911, but dragged my limp body to a cold shower, fully clothed, which I came to again sometime later after being smacked around a bit. Spent the next few months in a daze, got arrested twice more, OD’d one more time, where oddly enough the heroin I used gave me an irregular heart beat and A-Fib, with a resting heart rate of 145 BPM. Went to the hospital, and two days later found myself in rehab. I used again on and off and got arrested one more time before I finally quit in November 2014. 

Between 2014 and 2017 I only drank on and off, but each run brought me lower. In 2017 I was basically 12th stepped, weirdly enough, by the friend who threw me in the shower, who was still actively using and drinking. He brought me to an AA meeting every day for two weeks, before he returned to using, and he basically is the reason I’m sober today. Things began to change quickly. I met my wife-to-be, got my degree in accounting, got a job, am one test away from my CPA, and my life has never been better. I can’t believe I am going to marry the love of my life tomorrow, but I am so grateful what no using and drinking has done for me, and that I am still alive despite so many close calls. 

I know I haven’t really been active in this subreddit in a good number of years, but it was instrumental in helping me quit heroin. Some of you were close friends for a very long time, even becoming texting buddies for a good while. It pains me to say that some I would text off Reddit aren’t with us anymore, but for those of you who are here, you can do it. I feel really lucky today and I am so grateful. None of this would be possible if I was still using. I’d either be dead or wanting to be dead. Cheers!",24

I remember when i was dope sick as fuck from fentanyl and xanax, the withdrawals were so bad that I thought there is no way this powder could be causing this and all my weight loss, I must have a terminal disease.  

The monkey on the back never left until i resolved the spiritual and emotional pain.  Any addicts here that overcame things like cancer?  

I wonder if addicts that overcome these addictions are different the other normal people.  It amazes me to see so many stories of addicts becoming successful and/or the best version of themself after kicking drugs.  Do you think your battles with this beast made you a stronger person?  In what ways did you benefit?

&#x200B;

If you could turn back time, and never fall into this, would you?  In exchange you would’ve remained sober but not gain the experience of the despair you went through.

&#x200B;

Sometimes i feel like the hoops we hurdle through and the shit we juggle especially functioning addicts to hide everything felt like navy seal training.  I never hit rock rock bottom where i lost everything and went to the streets though, and it always makes me astonished to see those guys overcoming those odds.  I was blessed where i didnt lose everything and was at a position to gain some things back.  But i wonder how my life would’ve been if i was out on the streets?  

&#x200B;

Is it me, or are most addicts really smart and cunning people?   Seems more so then the majority of the population.  Do you guys think the battle benefited us or hurt us in life for the long run?  Would you trade the expereince?",2

2021-10-28 09:51:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/qhnj7c/tough_love/,Tough love?,"First, I am an addict in recovery.
I’ve been clean from heroin for 4 years and got that way because I have family who just wouldn’t give up on me.

I just wanted to voice my opinion on tough love so here’s my story…

My husband and I had been opioid addicted for at least ten years when we finally came clean and reached out to his mother for help to get clean.

Her first instinct was to show her only son “tough love”.

She completely turned her back on us and our 3 children and told him not to contact her until he was clean. 
She actually had her husband call to tell us that we were not welcome at their house (which we rarely were ever there anyway) or he’d have his gun handy.

My husband grew up with just his mom and had no other family in the state we live. They were close.

She’s a very narrow minded person so she just shut us out. Actually, she made it out to her coworkers and friends as if we were doing this to HER.

After she did that, my husband fell in to a deep depression.
He just couldn’t get past his mother turning her back on him. Not long after that, my husband od’d. He survived but even that didn’t phase her.

Tough love may work on some people but addicts are very resourceful and will just move on to more nefarious methods to get by. 
You can’t create a bottom for an addict because most of the time, they are going to buck.
You have to let an addict hit his own bottom.

Just like you can’t force someone to think or feel a certain way, you can’t make an addict want to get clean. They really have to want it themselves.

Turning your back almost guarantees they are going to go and show you that they don’t need you. And maybe od or commit a crime that gets somebody killed.

I’m definitely not saying to enable them but addiction is a disease that needs understanding, support and treatment.

You wouldn’t show tough love for someone that has cancer or diabetes.

Addiction is the same thing. A disorder that needs to be treated.

I always knew you were dangerous, but the initial romance we had made me think I was special and could be the first person to control you, but it never works that way. 

One day without notice, your sweet siren song turned into a brutal and obsessive death screech. You slowly got rid of all my interests and replaced them with your selfish self. I used to think that you helped me deal my with problems, but have come to realize that you only helped me ignore my problems. I would have done anything for you, and what did you ever do for me? Nothing but take, take, take! 

You’ve killed my favorite musicians, my favorite actors, and even my best friend, and yet I still couldn’t end my affair with you. When you weren’t around, I felt like I wanted to die until I could see you, and when we were together, our relationship mutated into a very sick codependency in which I couldn’t think about anything else but you and how to spend as much time together as possible. You make me feel like life will be better with you, then you crush everything that matters to me. You turned a young, bright eyed kid who just wanted love and adored cinematic romance into a cynical man who distanced himself from everyone trying to get close. 

But no more, you still try and trick me back into a relationship with you, but I will no longer answer your siren. I can finally see past the seductiveness and see you for what you really are, an ever consuming bitch who will not give up until I am swallowed whole. Because I realize that there isn’t enough room in my life to both be with you, and to pursue the life I want and deserve. 

So I choose life! I choose happiness, I choose mental stability, I choose relationships of substance, and I choose self discovery. I will now do to you what you have been trying to do me to since the day we met, let you die alone.",30

For those who have struggled or currently struggling is there anything I can do on my part as the only help ?? Is there anything you wished anyone could have done to help ??,4

2021-10-27 01:45:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/qgpn7m/iv_been_worried_that_my_sister_was_relapsing_and/,Iv been worried that my sister was relapsing and i was hoping i was just paranoid but i just found dope in her purse...,So let me start this out right and give you some insight to my situation if ya dont mind. I have been a fent/H user for several years now and have finally managed to stay clean for almost 6 months with just one slip up for one day which is by far the best iv ever been able to do and weather it seems like alot to some or not i am very proud of myself even tho i fucked up one day i didnt let it get my down and i made the best of my fuck up and learned how to deal with the urges you have even after being sober 6 months i still wake up from terrible dreams and panicing wanting to get high. But iv learned to deal the best i can and to say it has been easy would be a complete lie much if not all of you already know. My sister has been using the same amount of time as me same as her fiancé. We all got into it at the same time and let it spiral out of control and completely run our entire life. We all decided to quit at the same time and went through the withdrawals together and even tho they both relapse over and over for a month before finally getting completely clean I managed to actually stay clean the whole month. And then took care of them and made sure they couldnt really get any and they made it through the withdrawals and at the time of quitting the fentanyl and H also quit our jobs for various reasons mostly due to the fact we were about to be sick for two-three weeks and knew we wouldnt be able to work and would end up fired anyways. At this time her and her fiancé and I were not living together and they had seemed from what i could tell to actually be staying clean. So fast forward about 4 months to about a month from today my sister and her fiancé moved back into my house with me and agaim they both just got really good jobs for the first time in there lifes like high high paying jobs because they were both sober and able to piss clean and get an actual career. Well up until about a week ago i started to notice them completely change. Its was like i was watching them start the process over again with the nodding out at any giving point in the day time. They were happy as could be one min and then angry asf the next. I was hoping that i was just being extremely paranoid and just looking at it the wrong way. But today my sister freaked out calling me and her fiancé(his name is bama) saying she needed one of us to bring her a purse cause she left something she needed for work at home and need someone to bring it to her. Well i could tell by her story that it just wasnt making sense as to why at midnight she wanted us to bring this purse to her work. Well bama(again her fiancé) was nodding out so bad he couldnt even stand up so she called me begging and crying to me to bring her this purse or she would get fired or something... well i get half way to her work and go to check her purse just to make sure she had what she was asking for was actually in the purse. And of course it wasnt and so i happen to see a balled up little paper receipt in this pocket and i open it only to find about a $20 sack of H. So now guys and gals i do not know what to do next. I know i need to confront her because she has already OD in the past and she was extremely lucky yo be alive. I care for botg of them and i dont wnat to make them feel bad or that im judging them but i dont want them to get caught back up in the cycle again. Sorry for the long vent i just needed to get this out.,3

I feel selfish for wishing i could see him. I feel weird doing normal mundane things knowing he’s there and probably feeling worse than i am. I cant stop thinking about what happened.

I don’t know how to go on, im so scared and worried and i just want him to be okay. I feel so alone now. I am trying to focus on the positive but its hard sometimes. The thought of losing him to this evil disease makes me sick, and i know that if he doesnt change for the better than im going to need to do whats best for me.

2021-10-26 11:54:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/qg9gtp/how_to_stop_restless_legs_from_opiate_withdrawal/,How To Stop Restless Legs From Opiate Withdrawal,"***Note: I am not a medical professional.***

Restless  Leg Syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by the  overwhelming urge to move your body to stop painful or weird sensations.  Restless Leg Syndrome usually affects the legs, though some people get  symptoms in their arms, torso or head. There have even been reports of  people with RLS in phantom limbs. 

**RLS symptoms can manifest in the following ways:**   

* Pain and/or aching in muscles 
* An itchy feeling that cannot be relieved by scratching 
* A “crawly” feeling 
* A feeling of being tickled 

**There are two types of RLS:**   

* Idiopathic – This is a primary condition without a known cause or cure. 
* Secondary  – Can be caused by many different things including side-effects from a  medication or medical conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, opiate  withdrawal and more.   

Restless  Leg Syndrome from opiate withdrawal will be the focus of this article.  One of the symptoms of opiate withdrawal is jumpy legs, twitchy legs,  dancing legs, or restless legs…. whatever  you prefer to call it. It is different than traditional RLS because the  cause of it is known (opiate withdrawal), and there is a cure (time)  because it goes away on its own after a few days or weeks. There are  many awesome strategies for stopping opiate withdrawal restless legs. 

If  you really want to know what helps RLS during opiate withdrawal, you’ve  come to the right place. My simple and effective 4-Step Plan can stop  restless legs from aching, tickling, twitching, crawling, and  break-dancing across the room. Furthermore, this natural plan is so  powerful that it doesn’t just stop restless legs…it can also work  extremely well for reducing insomnia, pain, fatigue, depression,  anxiety, sweating, hot and cold flashes, gastrointestinal upset and lack  of appetite. 

**Step 1: Exercise and Stretch**  

One  of the most powerful strategies for treating opiate withdrawal restless  legs is to exercise. Walking, cycling and swimming have all been shown  in studies to reduce RLS symptoms. Exercise at a moderate pace and don’t  over exert yourself. You can walk or cycle on the street, or on a  treadmill and stationary bike. 

**Note:** *Morning,  afternoon and evening are all excellent times to exercise, just don’t  perform strenuous exercise within 1-2 hours before going to bed as this  has been shown to worsen Restless Leg Syndrome.* 

**After you get done exercising, make sure to use the following leg stretches which have also been shown to be helpful for RLS:**  

* [Calf stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1HzSAuB-Vw) 
* [Quad stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH8js7uRU2M) 
* [Front thigh stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVYRUZ-k9HQ) 

**Step 2: Take Supplements for RLS**  

There are incredible natural supplements that can be used to stop opiate withdrawal restless legs. Valerian root is an herb that was shown in a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19284179)  to improve symptoms of RLS and insomnia. Valerian works on the GABA  receptors in the brain in a similar way that Xanax, Valium and other  benzodiazepines do. Valerian is well-known for its ability to relax  muscles and tension, decrease anxiety and improve sleep. Passion  flower is another herb I highly recommend using for RLS. It works in the  same way that valerian does, plus it can really uplift your mood. 

Magnesium is an “anti-stress” mineral that was shown in a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9703590) to  be a useful alternative therapy in patients with RLS. Magnesium can  help to stop restless legs from opiate withdrawal by easing muscle and  nervous tension, thereby allowing the legs to loosen up and relax. 

[L-tyrosine](https://opiateaddictionsupport.com/l-tyrosine-for-opiate-withdrawal/)  is a non-essential amino acid that can be used to stop restless legs  from opiate withdrawal. L-tyrosine converts to L-dopa in the brain.  L-dopa then converts to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Considerable  evidence suggests that RLS is related to a dysfunction in the brain’s  basal ganglia circuits that use dopamine, which is needed to produce  smooth, purposeful muscle activity and movement. Disruption of these  pathways frequently results in involuntary movements. Individuals with  Parkinson’s disease, another disorder of the basal ganglia’s dopamine  pathways, often have RLS as well. 

**Note:** *During  opiate withdrawal, you are literally going through the worst dopamine  withdrawal imaginable, which could be the main reason for RLS symptoms.  In traditional RLS treatment, doctors often prescribe dopamine agonist  medications, which are drugs that mimic the neurotransmitter dopamine. A  natural way to increase dopamine for opiate withdrawal restless legs  would be to use an L-tyrosine supplement.* 

**The following supplement can also significantly reduce RLS symptoms:** 

* Elimidrol
* Calm Support
* Bio Rebalance
* 5htp + Melatonin
* Somaderm Gel

**Step 3: Take Epsom Salt Baths** 

If  you’ve never had one of these, you are truly missing out. It’s a quick,  inexpensive and natural way to stop restless legs from opiate  withdrawal. Epsom salt is actually not even salt. It’s a naturally  occurring pure mineral compound consisting of sulfate and magnesium.  Both of these are easily absorbed through the skin. 

**Epsom salt baths are an ideal way to gain the following benefits during opiate withdrawal:** 

* Flushes toxins from the body 
* Relaxes the nervous system 
* Soothes back pain and aching limbs 
* Improves the absorption of nutrients 
* Helps RLS during opiate withdrawal 

**Note:** *Research  also shows that magnesium increases energy and stamina by promoting ATP  (adenosine triphosphate) production. It helps to produce serotonin, the  chemical in the brain that helps you feel emotionally relaxed. Stress  drains the body of magnesium, so it’s important to replenish it while  going through opiate withdrawal.* 

**To use Epsom salt baths to stop RLS during opiate withdrawal:** 

* Pour  two cups of Epsom salt into a hot bath and soak for at least 10-15  minutes. Stay in the bath as long as the water is still warm to get the  most benefits. 

Step 4: Apply Self-Heal Balm With A Hot Washcloth 

[Self-Heal Balm](http://selfhealbalm.com/self-heal-balm/) is  an all-natural topical pain-relieving cream that can be used to stop  restless legs from opiate withdrawal. It has a pain-relieving and  muscle-relaxing combination of organic herbs, essential oils, castor oil  and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). One of the main ingredients that are  useful for RLS is St. John’s Wort oil, which repairs nerve damage and  restores neural transmission. The DMSO and healing herbs work to relax  tight and sore muscles in just seconds. These ingredients can also ease  RLS symptoms. 

**To use Self-Heal Balm to help RLS during opiate withdrawal:**  rub a generous portion of the balm onto problem areas such as calves,  hamstrings, behind the knees, or anywhere else that is bugging you.  Next, soak some washcloths in hot water and ring them out so they are  still wet but not dripping. Apply the wet cloths to your legs over the  area where you applied Self-Heal Balm. The hot and damp washcloths will  help to drive the active ingredients in the balm into your muscles for  quick RLS relief. 

Finally,  get two dry regular towels and wrap them around each leg. You can use  two Ace bandages to tie the towels to your legs. Make sure they are not  so tight that they cut off circulation, but snug to the point where you  feel RLS relief. You can do this anytime you are resting at home during  withdrawal. 

**Note:** *Make sure to use this technique right before you get into bed at night to help you fall asleep.* 

&#x200B;

**Things That Aggravate RLS** 

**Even though your Restless Leg Syndrome is caused by opiate withdrawal, there are certain things that trigger RLS that I recommend staying away from anyways:** 

* Nicotine 
* Caffeine 
* Alcohol 
* Excessive stress 
* Excessive refined sugar intake 
* Antihistamines",12

I used weed to taper down and jump off. I was so fucked on the steroids that is modern weed  that I barely noticed anything except some motor agitation at night.

I had horrible constipation during the time I was drinking tea, I rarely smoked weed then but I noticed that when I did the constipation would resolve.  I had gastritis so bad I'd smell like I was composting at times.

Now my problem is that I still have gastritis but without the constipation. I think I swapped one shitty drug for another that I thought would be less harmful and found out otherwise. I've got symptoms that could be CHS including reflux and the gastritis I mentioned. I don't vomit though.

I've done the GP, hospital thing. They're hopeless. They gave me omeprazole which blurs my vision and domperidone that gives me severe stomach cramps. I gave them to the garbage bin. 

I simply can't live for any length of time without addiction. I won't ever go back to alcohol  because it would be the end for me. Too tired to bother gambling. I'm thinking of tanking up on tea and getting into a suboxone program.

Was 3 years on and off(a couple lapses) sober when hip pain lead me to a specialist for management of arthritis and an impingement (29yrs old 😭) with covid, treatment was a long way off so pain management was the approach, I hid nothing from the doc about my addiction and for some reason still put on opioids straight up. As you would expect after a month I had convinced my doc to put things up and up. At the end I was on 150mg slow release tramadol 2x a day and and 3rd strength of Oxy 2-3 times a day. Not sure how much it was. After a couple weeks of this the doc said they trust me and gave my a months script.
I ate it in about 4 or 5 days, I had already been abusing them but not like this. My last day was about a box of each in 2 sittings. 

During the weeks leading up to this I had started occasionally drinking again also. 

This was about 2 weeks ago, obviously I havnt been back to my doctor as that wouldn't go down well. I'm now a couple weeks clean and 3 weeks sober. The first 4-5 days where hell my sleep was either mon existent or for 18 hours straight. The pain my insides felt was excruciating and food was way off the table.

I've kicked heroin several times and never had a problem. It's staying clean that's hard for me. Usually either cold turkey, tapering, or Bernese method I've gotten clean at least 6 times over the past decade. I've had clean runs for up to a year. But I think I've dug myself a hole really deep this time and I'm just so done. Was using about .3-.4 fent per day, smoked. I never want to touch drugs again. I've fucked everything up and this is my last chance at redemption.

I've made over 20 calls to rehab places, doctors, psychiatrists, my pastor, friends, etc etc and I've successfully tapered down to a fairly low amount of powdered fent. I've used twice over the past week. October 17th - 21st I didn't use anything. On the 22nd I decided I needed to use so that I could take care of a family function which would have devastated me if I missed it. I had a tiny bit left on Saturday, but haven't used since. 

The problem with fent is that I don't even start withdrawals until, like day 3 or 4. I've been told to go to rehab, and I am willing to go, but there are reasons why rehab wouldn't be in my best interest which I don't really feel like sharing. I just think it's best I man up and try to do this myself. I've been Bernese'ing a bit. I sourced on 8mg sub which over the past 3 days I've been taking tiny amounts of just to get some in my system. I have an appointment with a rehab place this morning I am going to check out and ask some questions. But my current plan is to just man up and try to get through this week. You guys know the struggle. About 90% of the people I've talked to have treated me like I'm a piece of trash. I have been running a multi-million dollar business, and keeping my finances in well order. My therapist said, I'm a cronic relapser because I never have to face any consequences. But this time, I know if I don't quit for good, my SO is going to leave me. She is so so so very done with my BS. Like any addict I've lied and lied and lied and it kills me that I've hurt her so bad. Maybe I am a piece of trash - but only because my brain has been hijacked. I want my brain back. I'm ready to be the man I was meant to be.

I have immodium, about 6mg of subs left, and a few Xanax for sleep. I am worried that the fent withdrawal will take weeks instead of days like heroin. I've heard conflicting stories about this - I guess it depends on what analoug you were using. Anyways, I just wanted to post here. I am being 100% transparent with my SO and my parents who are my support system. Any other advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",3

I am 2 weeks clean and I am feeling totally fantastic.  I earn good money but have been living like a pauper to feed my habit and even got into debt.  Suddenly I can afford new clothes, gigs, eating out, pretty much anything a regular non-opioid addicted person with an income can do.

My head is clear and I am not constantly worried about the supply lines getting stuck and going into forced withdrawal, or having to borrow money from my credit streams to avoid withdrawal, or scraping crumbs of oxy out of containers to try to avoid going into withdrawal or trawling pharmacies to get codeine or DHC to CWE to avoid going into withdrawal. Admittedly there are times when I miss the oxy buzz, but I know it's not worth sacrificing all of the above for that, and in any case the buzz was only ever the restoration of my normal self and the relief from the withdrawal symptoms.  In fact that was the part I loved the most, feeling shit and then feeling the rush of feeling great within minutes of snorting or eating.  But no more of that bullshit.  Of course, one day at a time!  Having been on and off the horse for years I know how easy it is to slip back on so I will aim to be vigilant.

Then, like a fucking idiot, I decided to use heroin again. Only once but I did it and didn't tell her. This weekend, the guilt finally caught up with me and I told her. She lost it, she didn't care that I told her, she wanted me to come to her before I relapse.

She's told me she wants a break. She also told me that maybe someday we could try again but right now she feels done. She said she knows we are soulmates and that's why it breaks her heart so much. 

However she's not asking me to move out and our lease isn't up til late next year. I've already contacted my addictions counselor to find meetings I would enjoy and fo get set up at a weekly, thorough drug testing facility. 

Is there any hope of my relationship surviving this? I can't believe I am such a fucking idiot. I rebuilt so much trust only to throw it away. I know relapse is part of recovery and the regret was so overwhelming that I'd never do it again but she doesn't know that.

In time, could this be repaired or have I broken trust forever? I really don't know how I'd live without her. We had plans to have a baby this year.",29

I know this sounds stupid, but I really didn't think anything in this world could be this good. Obviously I heard all the warnings, but I kicked so many other drugs I thought I could be strong enough to get over this. But man opiates are a while nother league compared to everything else, yes even benzos! I legit lost everything I had in life, and I still want to use. People say it's like holding a loaded gun to your head well yeah I believe it now. I want to be clean, but some days I seriously have doubts I'll be able to go the rest of my life without using again. I know I'm still relatively newly sober, but I really thought after a month or two the cravings would die down. I now really understand why people say they think about it daily after being clean for long periods of time. If anything the depression I have still from losing everyone that I cared about and basically having to start a new life again, but this time with painful memories makes me want to use even more! I'm even on Zoloft for depression now currently and it doesn't help. Thankfully I have no way to get opiates and I'm on Suboxone so I can't use. I just really don't understand how anybody can get clean for years on end bc I really can't see me going the rest of my life without opiates especially now and I'm only 28 years old... It's gonna be a rough life. Sorry for ranting just really need to say this lol.

Edit: appreciate the help everybody. I think what gets me the most is knowing I lost almost everybody I once loved and they aren't coming back into my life. It's like fuck it all I have are opiates.",14

I couldnt sleep because i wanted to listen to him breathing. Hes addicted to fentanyl, which is in the percs he buys. Before we went to sleep he smoked one and he was relapsing from being 9 days sober. He told me he loved me, went to sleep, was breathing very slowly, so i stayed awake and listened. At around 6:30-6:40AM he woke up and immediately went to smoke more of them. I asked him not to but he still did it. He came back to bed after. He was nodding out but responsive, then i made him take a puff from his inhaler and he passed out. He was unresponsive, i tried slapping him shaking him nothing. Then i turned my flash on my phone and his lips were turning blue. I immediately started to panic and i woke up my dad and his girlfriend. His whole face was purple now. My dad helped me drag him out of my bed and on the floor, i performed CPR on him until the medics came and they revived him. Called his parents at the hospital stayed with him until he was discharged with them and i went to his house just now to say goodbye, hes going to detox/rehab today. I cannot get the image out of my head, he looked dead. I was crying so much praying that he wouldnt die. I love him so much, he loves me. Hes addicted and needed help but he wasn’t really taking action. Maybe this needed to happen for him to realize, but i cant stop thinking about what if i wasnt there, or what if i was asleep. I know that i was there for a reason and hes been given a second chance. Right now he needs to focus on himself and really think about things. I don’t know how long he will be gone for, but however long he needs is okay. I just don’t know what to do now, im glad hes gonna be okay but i still worry.

I'm thinking of going on to it, but am in the middle of divorce. My ex and I are on good terms and she's not going to oppose joint custody, this is what she wants, however as I understand it it still goes through the courts even if you agree because that's how the law works, and ultimately the court has the final say and can go against the parents' wishes. I only use pharma opioids (not always prescribed), orally, I have never been visibly intoxicated, it has never interfered with my work or parenting, in fact no one has ever even noticed. I just depend on them to function. So it does not in any way pose a risk to my kids, but at the moment there is no record anywhere that I have an opioid addiction and I know that when you start OST they are obliged to consider any child safety implications (which in a case like mine may simply mean checking to make sure you're going to store them securely, I don't know). So I'm just worried that once social services are informed maybe it's going to end up as a factor in the court process, and that those kind of people may not realize that it's possible to be taking opioids daily and be completely functional and a capable parent. I should say that I'm the kind of person to whom social services and the courts are likely to give the benefit of the doubt (white, middle-class, middle-aged, highly educated, etc.) But I have a general distrust of all these kinds of authorities anyway",1

The Suboxone immediately cleared up the Oxy w/d I was in, and I have felt fine each day taking 2.5mg.

I took ~2.5mg of Suboxone for the past 6 days, with my last dose of ~1.25mg being last night. Today I have been feeling kinda crummy mild w/d symptoms (I'm currently around 24hrs since last Suboxone dose)... Have I already built a dependence on subs or am I feeling the tail end of the Oxy?

I would really, really like to kick these subs right now and be completely free of all opiates. I have the determination to do it, but now I am terrified I have given myself 2+ extra weeks of w/d from trying to do a taper method using suboxone.

Edit: Update for anyone stumbling upon this post later on.  Still working to taper off. I took .5mg yesterday and another .5mg today to help lighten the w/d symptoms a bit.  Total dosing schedule has been:

I'll start. It was almost exactly one year ago on the date when I was going through a period of heavy oxy use, and I couldn't find anything but 5mg pills, which, well, are horrible. I hadn't eaten properly because I had no appetite and I crushed up all the tablets (80mg's worth), swallowed half and snorted the other, which completely blocked my nose. Now, I didn't get a rush at all, so I threw a snuff bag (strong nicotine product) under my lip to see if it intensified it for a bit, but since I hadn't eaten anything for a long time I immediately felt extreme nause and had to throw up. So I ran to the toilet and threw up, of course to see little pieces of crushed up oxys in my puke. And being the degenerate addict I was/am, I started eating them out of the toilet, off the floor... And that's when I realized I was also eating cat litter off the bathroom floor. I didn't even vomit at the thought. I did not get any sleep that night.

Probably a lot more stories but that's a moment that springs to mind since I was 30 days clean after that episode.

I have tons of CBD, supplements, and I can get Kratom,  but would rather avoid another addictive substance. Please help!!! This isn’t me!!! I miss me. My babies need a better version of me. I am at a crossroads. If I change this now, the life my girls and I could have is truly Magical. If not, we are all headed for poverty.

I have been clean off of heroin for a little less than 2 years. I am back in college, manager at my job, have my own place, good relationships with my family and friends, have a boyfriend that isn’t a felon. Shit is going well, objectively. However, I constantly feel like an imposter. Especially at school. Surrounded by all these normie kids who have never been homeless or shot up behind a dumpster. I feel out of place, but more than anything I feel fearful because I know that I will not be taken seriously professionally, and will likely be turned down from many jobs. 
In my learning and behavior class last week we ONLY talked about heroin addiction. What heroin addicts need to get high, how they use, why they use, how impossible it is to get clean, etc. I nearly broke a pencil trying to keep it together.. I am missing the apathy more than anything right now. Idk. I’m rambling, but was just wondering if anyone on this subreddits has experience with this feeling and has any advice",22

Need advice.","I've been on Methadone for over 4 years now. I topped off at 128Mg and have been slowly going down. Now I'm at 9mg and I'm feeling sick every night around 11 or  midnight but sometimes it hits me at different times during the day. My councilor told me to let my body ""catch up"" every once in a while and I did at 17mg, 12mg and now at 9mg. Everytime I start going down again, I'm feeling it right away and I'm starting to think ""what's the point of catching up if I instantly feel sick if I go down even 1mg?""
 Now I'm at 9mg and I've been on it for over a month but feeling sick every day for a few hours each night, then its gets a little better for a few hours then I dose and repeat the process. The sick hours seem to fluctuate as well. I took a dose at 7am and didnt feel better until 11am. I dont take my dose at the same time each day but it only really fluctuates within 2 or 3 hours. Sometimes I take it at 4am and sometimes 7am or 10am.

When i gave my last U.A, they didn't detect any methadone at all so it seems it's running its course before I dose the next day?? My councilor knows I'm not doing anything wrong but there seems to be a few higher ups that think I'm being sneaky and selling my dose but I've been complaining to my councilor the past couple months that I havent been feeling good so they are taking that into consideration. She seems to think I'm on such a low dose that it's out of my body before I dose the next day but I thought Methadone was long lasting and doesn't leave your system for 3 or 4 days? It's weird.

I'm really just looking for people who have been in similar circumstances that have some advice for getting off this medication with as little withdrawls as possible. Thank you.",4

It doesn’t matter how I use it but it’s the worst way you can do it if you’re wondering. It’s taken a toll on me as I can’t sleep in any position but propped up with my arms at my sides, if I sleep on my side my arms will go numb from circulation problems due to use.

I have two questions. I used to be very fit and vascular but not so much anymore no more vascular visible. I am wondering if working out can bring back some of this? I know probably not visibly but at least circulation wise?

My second question is is methadone worth doing to quit? I honestly wanted to take it for maybe 3 days to a week, long enough for the H to get out of my system but NOT long enough to get addicted to methadone. Is this a viable method of quitting? The last time I quit I had no relapses for a year before I got back into it.

Also how much does methadone reduce WD? And if I slip up and use will it get me high or will it set in precipitated WD? I know I can ask all these questions at a clinic but I feel like they might lie and tell me I HAVE to be on it for a year minimum or some shit to get my money.

And yes I’ve considered Sub but don’t want to deal with WD and the thought of avoiding them and PWD is preferred. Also don’t have the discipline for weening, but realistically who does?

I was hoping to get in the clinic and get started before the weekend if the advice takes me there. I tried posting this in opiates and no one responded. Thanks everyone.

I started on 500mg a day and I’ve gotten down to 250mg a day. 

However, I have endometriosis(which is hellishly painful) and suffered a miscarriage 5 weeks ago. I was put on oramorph (morphine sulfate) liquid 10mg/5mg oral solution, to help with pain. 

I have been given weekly prescriptions so that I cannot go over my amount each day etc… or I can but I’d be left short. This was my idea as I wanted off of them. It’s taken a long time to taper as I’m so afraid of the withdrawals. I’ve felt them numerous times and it’s the worst thing in the world. 

Long story short. 

I know that the liver converts to morphine etc…. 

But, when I’m on oramorph, obviously I’m able to take less tramadol, because it helps the withdrawals etc…. And the main thing is the mental withdrawals for me, the brain zaps, the depression, anxiety etc… 
Because of the SSRI. 
If I taper down off my tramadol to possibly at least 50mg/100mg this week while taking my oramorph(there’s only 100ml so it won’t last long) 
Will this help? Like…. When my oramorph runs out, will I just be feeling exactly the same because of how it converts? 

I just want off tramadol SO badly. Like I’ve been on it for like 7/8 years now. I’m trying for a family and with endometriosis it’s already bad. 
I’m just wondering if this will help the taper? 
I won’t get prescribed more oramorph just next week or anything so I can’t and don’t have access to it. So just trying to possibly use it to come off tramadol, and then if I have any slight withdrawals just take a couple mls? 

Or has anyone had similar and can think of a taper plan? I’m desperate. I know it’s not a crazy amount. 5 pills a day, but it really is for me. I dose all my 5 pills at once, usually around 3pm.

2021-10-20 03:34:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/qbvfsc/advice_needed/,Advice needed…,"I had an entire essay typed out but I realized people wouldn’t really pay attention to me venting so here’s the short version. 

I don’t really have anyone to talk to so even negative comments would be appreciated.

I turned 19 last month and for the past year and a half I’ve been doing hard drugs on a daily basis. 

By hard I don’t only mean opioids ( H, fent, zenes, oxys ) but also meth, other stims, benzos, pregabalin, somas and alcohol. 

I graduated high school in June (2021) and went on a trip to Europe, ( I live in the US but I got family and friends in Europe ) and I kept doing the same drugs + up to two packs of cigarettes per day. 

The whole Europe trip is a thing me and my close family do every summer. My parents have a place there so I lived with them. The interactions between me and my parents were limited as we all mind our own business and try to be as respectful as possible.  

I knew that after summer vacay was over I’d have to go back to the states and attend the university of my choice ( pretty solid college to be honest ) 

Fast forward to august when my parents came to the realization that I was abusing substances as they stumbled across a handbag in my room. It was not your typical personal stash and the quantities were pretty insane so the whole thing could have turned into a intent to distribute case real quick. Thankfully it didn’t. 

For the past 2 months I’ve been back in the states living with them since they don’t trust me and wouldn’t let me go to college ( it’s about 5 hours away). 

Right now I’m taking online classes and I’ll transfer to my city’s State University in January (2022). 

I’m 7 weeks clean off everything and see a psychiatrist and my GP once a week. 

Last month I was also diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and my GP was pretty concerned. 

So far the doctors I see only know about my benzo, adderall and alcohol abuse because I also have ADHD and want to speed the whole former addict medication thing up. I know they won’t put me on any stims for the next few years but that’s not my concern at the moment. 

My psychiatrist couldn’t believe the fact that I kicked a habit of up to 12mg of Xanax, 1.5g of lyrica and over 300mg of oxycodone a day. Cold turkey too. No seizures no nothing. Oh and about 15oz of hard liquor. I don’t really remember how much coke, meth and adderall I used to do but it was a decent amount. 

The thing is that I still crave these substances and I know for a fact that stims such as Ritalin ( or even 4f-mph) make me more productive and help me with my adhd. The benzos help with my adhd induced anxiety and help me sleep better. And the opioids, well… 

I have really easy access to anything and by anything I mean anything and this makes it really hard for me to forget about the euphoria and bliss they give you. 

I’m not in pain but the fact that I’m sober makes me feel invincible and Im really thinking about treating myself with a bag of H and some coke. 

I know that this is the worst possible idea that I could think of since it’s a terrible slippery slope and will probably have me going to rehab in a few months. 

I kind of want to risk it all just to test if I can maybe use with moderation this time ( I know it’s a cheap excuse, but I can’t really see myself staying sober in the near future). 

I know these cravings will fade overtime but I’m not sure if I’m gonna be strong enough to stay sober so what’s the difference ? 

I guess if any older folks would like to share their experiences I’d really really appreciate that. 

Thanks in advance.",1

For medical reasons, I have been on Valoron/Tilidin 50mg/4mg (ret.) for about two years with a break of about 3 months from September 2020 to November 2020. In consultation with my doctor I have reduced my dose from 100mg - 100mg - 200mg to 0 within the last four weeks. I took my last pill on Sunday at midnight. That was 48 hours ago and I do actually feel okay-ish and can even sleep a few hours every night, mainly thanks to Clonidine and Elavil/Amitriptilyn. The Clonidine helps me reduce the majority of the pain and it even helps a little with the restlessness.  


So my question is: for my last withdrawal in september 2020 I went cold turkey without any medical support. The withdrawal lasted about 48 hours and I felt pretty okay afterwards. Most of the remaining symptoms disappeared within the following two weeks. However, the severe pain never actually left. I still had that painful tugging and tearing in my legs, my lower back and my shoulders. I couldn't sleep properly for about 3 months due to ""the pain"" and I have also not felt any noticeable improvement within those 12 weeks. Finally, my doctors put me back on medication until two days ago. Has anyone of you any experiences with the intensity and duration of this kind of pain? Is it - at all - related to the withdrawal? Is there anything to improve it? Do sports/workout help? Is the duration shorter or longer when phasing out than when going cold turkey?  


I'm really afraid of it coming back because it weakens my preserverance. The withdrawal for the last six days was hell - as the 48 hours last time were. But what actually made me buckle last time was that specific pain that was there for weeks afterwards.",3

October 11th was 6th months off of methadone. Was on it for around 8 years before finally was over having to take it everyday. 1st month was a little rough but last 5 I've been feeling ok for what I came off of.

I do have some things going on with me that I'm not sure if it's partially due to paws or the methadone did some permanent damage. 

Past 4-5 years I've always had low energy,  motivation and just keep to myself majority of the time unless I took a good dose of 'done. Doesn't matter how much I sleep I just always feel run down, I feel like a 60 year old man most days. I don't work out but I do work a physically demanding job 50+ hours a week. Now I feel like I'm getting anxiety that seems to have started maybe a couple months after quitting . Usually it's not too noticable, then at times it gets intense where I feel my heart racing especially at work when I know it's going to be a long day and have to be around ppl I don't wanna be around. Other things like my eyes are sensitive to light & self confidence is basically non existent. 

I've been reading up some online and I'm kind of thinking it might be low testosterone or some kind of hormonal imbalance, which now I know methadone can affect. I tried 4 different places in town wanting to get blood work done and I just get told they can't help me without a doctor's order or not taking new patients. I found a family medicine center & made an appointment but it's over a month away. I haven't been to the doctors in probably 15 years except for a cpl times to the ER. So I'm a little worried hows it's going to go & if they're just going to try to give me Xanax or something of the sorts & send me on my way. The anxiety sucks but at the same time i'm real skeptical about getting on any kind of narcotics.

I’m a little nervous to take the jump and have some fear that I’ll still somehow be sick after it all, even though I’ve always been 90% good after 5 days detox, 100% day 8.

I know I need to make some changes to maintain sobriety, but right now my biggest thing is just to get clean. The depression from using is overwhelming. Once I get through the worst of detox, it’s always been smooth sailing for me. It’s staying clean 2+ years I haven’t been able to conquer yet before relapsing.

I know this is the easy part. Yes the first week was awful, yes tapering off subs in three days was worse, and yes the vivid drug dreams and emotions boiling up are horrendous. But I still feel sated; my cravings are mostly hidden by the pink cloud. When that cloud evaporates in six months, or a year, or whenever, I pray I'll have made something more meaningful in my life than a bit of gray powder. 

I'm lucky. I never went to prison like all of the other residents, I never OD'd, I never crashed my car and killed someone while I was nodding off. I still have the support and love of family and (some) friends, despite everything.

I know I fucked up my life on my own, but I certainly had help. I can't bring myself to forgive the people who helped make me a junkie. I certainly won't ever forget what they did. It's too much.

Pretty serious one too, not quite rhinoplasty but on par with pain. For some context ive been on suboxone on and off for almost 9 years. I understand thats way too long but its irrelevant to this story aside from some backstory. 

Anyways, i met my surgeon (ENT specialist) and went over with him how i absolutely cannot be on any sort of narcotics. He was very understanding considering my predicament. Even if they did, it wouldnt work as the suboxone would block traditional opiates. So yesterday was the day, i met with the OR nurses and the anesthesiologist. They all made it clear they wouldnt give me any opiates. Apparently after my surgery i was groaning in a lot of pain after coming out of anesthesia. When i started coming to in the recovery room i heard the nurse on the phone with one of the doctors saying she had already pushed 150 mics of fentanyl, and was getting ready to push 50 more. She asked me if i knew where i was, i answered but dont really remember what i said after that. She pushed more fentynal now up to 200 micrograms. 

I wasnt fully aware what was going on but definitely felt a bit of the typical ""fade"". Not as enjoyable as i remember. Ive been clean from all opiates aside from bupe for 10 years in february. Now im in the boat where i feel incredibly betrayed by the docs. They told me it was a miscommunication between the surgeon and anesthesiologist, although i remember talking to both of them prior about what i wanted. I also now have no idea when its okay to start back up on my zubsolv as ive gone through precipitated withdrawal and its miserable and want to avoid that. Any help understanding what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated. I feel like this was a great fuck up on their end and just ruined my 10 year sobriety. Also tips on when i can resume my subs would be appreciated as i know IV fentanyl is short acting and has a short half life.",5

I just kept myself busy and never really felt the urge to use Oxy - lo and behold, I found a legit connect who is always stocked. I don't want to count the exact amount of days but I'm pretty sure I've used Oxy the past 6-9 days. From recent usage, my tolerance has skyrocketed. I can sniff or eat 6 30mg blues (180mg) and not nod; in my past, 140mg was a huge night of nods. I've done all the potentiation that I can and have even engaged in polysubstance use to bring on a nod (pregabalin or xanax, mostly \[beyond the mandatory Benadryl and sometimes DXM\])

The past week, I've spent every fucking night chasing the dragon - I just want some clean nods like I used to. Out of my desperate attempts to nod, I've used at minimum 5 30's/day and up to 8 in a day, with ZERO success. Last night, in a last ditch effort to nod, I did the full potentiation with grapefruit juice, tonic water, DXM, tums and ate 6 30's - I definitely felt more than previous nights but like every time I've used lately, I add xanax at the end of the night to get every last bit of downer into my system AKA falling asleep on the couch

I'm spending $50 per 30mg oxy and I feel like that in the past 6-9 days, I've straight up BURNED 2k of my hard-earned money (which I am not in a position to be blowing). All just to unsuccessfully chase the dragon. H will never be on my docket but I have recently been a recluse with my social life, blowing off plans after plans and my work is taking a DIRECT hit (being a total shit head and sleeping til almost noon because I can get away with it). I was doing SO well before I found this connect but I'm realizing that I'm straight up mentally addicted, I get a craving and blow up my dude.

Thursday night, I gave myself one last attempt at nodding and failed spectacularly. Despite knowing each high costs $300+, I still find myself wanting to try. I'm trying to take off several weeks to get this tolerance down and try to find new outlets to supplement use (staying busy).

Not sure what I'm inquiring about but this opiate habit has gotten more out of control than it has in my entire life. I literally went to the bathroom twice during a family members bday dinner to rail Dilaudid in the bathroom (not to mention I tried plugging for the first time to feel something). I even went on a date all opiated out on some Dilaudid - fuck breaking a bone and experiencing IV Dilaudid as a youth.

I don't know where this stems from but I find solace in being very opiated and content.

Any advice on how I can move forward from this point? I'm too ashamed to speak about this with anyone but my therapist and I'm considering starting NA. My substance abuse goes far beyond just opiates. Looking for input on how I can break this cycle and try to kick OCs long term

Any input would be gold, thank you!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit: was scrounging around for any leftover fragments from previously broken Oxys like a fucking junkie. Found a full K9 and without hesitation, I snorted the whole thing while on 1.5mg of xanax, 350mg of Soma, several lines of top notch coke and several hits from the bong - wtf, I don't use for a night and immediately upon being able to use Oxy, I did - feeling shameful af.

Psychward crashed n burned. Which was worst place to go, as I got put on psych meds. Which I went cold turkey from after like a yr of trying to find right med. Horrible withdrawals bye the by. I ended up unable to kick klonopin which I'm STILL on. So, I still have that dance to look forward to. All that from tapering! 

Sorry for the rant. Well, I jumped off 1mg of meth on Aug 26. Almost 6 months no liquid handcuffs. Pretty strange, it now feels like steel handcuffs. PAWS is unreal. My vision, brain, anxiety/panic n depression are beyond. AND I ate 40 caps of kratom daily for 2 months after jump. Off kratom for almost 40 months.That was a Mistake!! I now have GERD that is keeping me in pain from belly to throat 24/7. That and every chronic ailment from head to toe. Real stuff, not in my head. On top of PAWs. Thyroid nodule, torn meniscus, pinched nerve under foot!! 

Makes me feel like the urban legends people spoke of on the streets. Like if someone dared to get of meth they would fall apart. I know this is not true, but I'm hanging by a thread. Mastery, not to be completely mentally lost. I was almost thinking about that shot people say u take 3x n off. Sublucade or something that sounds like that. That would be dumb though right?  A detour just like the kratom was a detour? Anyone, relate or know of someone who had it this hard n came good?

I had someone I used to use with hit me up and offer to buy 3 pharma Ms and do them with me. I stood strong and said fuck no. I’m finally not feeling like shit all day long. I can’t keep fucking putting myself through endless torture of giving a week clean then going right back to using and having to do the detox process all over again. It’s fucking exhausting. It’s weekend and I start a badass job on Monday! No more being a broke piece of shit. Let’s get it people! Next step is starting to workout again.

I dont even get high from it. I use it just not to feel so extremely depressed and anxious. It doesnt help anymore though. I have visited some psychiatrists and all of them told me that I should to the hospital for detox(+8-12 weeks for depression and addiction programme with psychiatrists and psychologists etc). Currently I am in winter semester but I cant bring myself to study. I have zero motivation, huge anhedonia, I am always tired …I have become addicted because of my depression, I wanted some relief …

anyways if I go to the hospital, I will have to repeat the academic year and I will feel like a failure but really idk what to do 
how did you taper off with minimal withdrawls symptoms?(any tips for help medicaments like memantine etc)

To start, I started using at the beginning of 2020.  It ramped up, over time, to about 1 gram a day, at the beginning of this year to about a few days over a month ago.  I had my first son last October. My only child.  I worked and took care of him high, never nodding, never failing as a parent, but I was abusing a drug and raising my baby.  It made me feel like shit, like I was less than everyone. I needed this drug to function and was doing it while, simultaneously, being the primary caregiver for my boy (his mom was in school full-time).  I had tried to stop a few times, never making it past two days of the sleepless, uncomfortable agony of the dope sick.  Then, after 3 times trying myself, I decided to check myself into rehab.  I opted for a Suboxone taper and it worked pretty well, although I still feel not normal, after this long ass month.  I feel like I should keep taking Suboxone, as it took away my cravings and made me feel normalish.  But, aside from that, I am a tiny bit over a month clean and that makes me feel a little pride lol.  I'm proud that I haven't relapsed yet and I'm far past the point of initial withdrawal.  I'm scared of the Post acute withdrawal symptoms but...I'll try and deal with that as it comes.  My son is my drug now, his smile and giggle has replaced the fat line of dope I used to need, do, enjoy.  

I just need some... reassurance that I will feel okay again, because, right now, I still feel shitty.  Like tired and lethargic and I can't sleep like a normal person yet. I toss and turn all night,maybe sleeping like 2 hours total.  

Thanks for reading my post, if you did.  I'll be checking in here, daily, as my clean time goes up. 

Much love",4
2021-10-15 10:02:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/q8p3hi/one_year_later/,One year later,"Oh man oh man ooh man…two years ago today i sat in my couch on the phone with my twin sister who is a recovering alcoholic, crying, withdrawing, “Will I ever be happy without it? (DOC)“. After years of addiction I had forgotten what is life without this drug. Every day waking up with withdraws, hiding from my partner what I’m really going through, sneaking around about where am aT because I can’t survive without this. My body needs it, survival comes first, this drug came first, making my body feel “normal” because normal now was this drug and then came my life. We all know here that feeling of waking up and right away feeling sick, do i have enough on me right now to survive for the morning just to feel “normal”. Do i have the $$ for my poison today? Can i make it to work??!? Or will i be withdrawing the rest of the time. But like most of you guys here my only problem was that I didnt know how to get out. How can I get past the withdrawals?! I didnt know how to get help. I didnt have the resources. I dont know anyone else going through this. I cant im too fcking weak! Why do i do this to myself?! Why did I get myself to this point?!? But I love the way it makes me feel.  I love the rush. I love the euphoria. I love the energy. But is this feeling worth ruining my relationships with my closed ones?! But it was no longer the feeling i chased for. It was now wanting to feel “normal” again. Living life without it again. But what is life without it? And my life when downhill. I am lucky enough to have a family that never let me down no matter what. Without even knowing what I was going through. They still supported me. One day I said I dont want to live anymore. If this is life I dont want it. I envied those who lived their life without taking a pill a day. I went on google and i found this subreddit and my life changed forever. I found so many stories similar to mines except i had never went to rehab or tried to detox because i just didnt know how to. Every day I checked in, every day the same people checked in with me and gave me the most and best information they can into going into recovery. I found a rehab center near me and got clean. I was so excited with my 1 month sobriety that I came here and expressed my excitement. One person commented how i will relapse, not to get so excited that the hard part was staying sober. I got so upset, how dare someone sh!t on my excitement like that. She was right I relapsed and my life went spiraling down once again just because of this fcing poison! But I was able to start all over again and I’ve never looked back. Im not going to tell you everything is perfect because is not. But let me tell you this new life of mine I used to dream of it in my sleep. I dreamed for the day that i woke up looking forward for my day, waking up in no pain, with no worries, just happy. With normal life problems. Yes life can be shity but life is life and we just have to handle problems as they come instead of drowning in DOC to numb the pain … to not feel. I come here every day and read your duly check ins. I read your question’s. Your comments. And i want to tell you all that I swear the clean life is so worth it man. Its been one year clean and Ive lost 50 pounds, I have traveled, i have found new hobbies, Ive been casted in TV shows, I’m still working in my relationship because so much happened that trust does take time to build. Rome wasn’t build in one day. It took me a year to see how beautiful my life has become. If anyone has any questions I’m willing to answer in all candor.",12

Stopped again then caved and took around 1/8th on Tuesday. Pills were 10mg norcos (prior to quitting I was at about 15 to 30 mg a day, but I’ve been higher than that daily in the past) I’d been having some bad cravings after that, but didn’t give in. Went to my GP and got back on a mood stabilizer I’d been on before (lamictal) and things are getting so much better!

The physical withdrawals have eased out again (not nearly as bad as the first time, but harder because the cravings were stronger). The lamictal has helped me so much already. Just last night I caught myself thinking, “life is boring without opiates” and then turned myself around like, “what am I talking about?? Look how much more I’ve been doing and how much better I’ve been feeling while I’m off them” and the craving stopped.

Just feeling really hopeful and excited that this time might stick. I’ve got a concert I’m going to Sunday and I haven’t been to a concert clean in 5 years. I’m very excited to experience it clean and I’m really hoping and pushing myself to make it till then and even longer after!

I’m 23 and big driving force for me is just wanting to be a normal person in my 20’s who can go out for a drink or two with friends on a whim. I never mixed, I was too afraid of dying lol.

Looking forward to the future, and to anyone struggling I’d maybe recommend looking into temporarily getting on some mood stabilizing meds? I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 18 so a lot of my use was self medicating though. But there’s hope and being clean is so nice!! There’s nothing like feeing like yourself again after years of yourself being lost without you even realizing you were lost in the first place",4

I’m in my late 30s, female, and I didn’t start doing heroin until 30 when a random internet date mentioned he had some and I wanted to try. I’ve suffered from severe depression my entire life, and at that time my best friend had just ended our relationship and I was suicidal. When I did dope, it was like 30 years worth of clouds suddenly parted and life was worth living. Other than that guy, I used completely alone. A different friend found out about my use, called my parents, and I agreed to go to rehab. Started using immediately after leaving, moved home, got on Suboxone, met and started dating my now husband (not an addict) and we have a son. Basically I’m a suburban mom. 
Through all this though, I’ve never fully moved on. I don’t have any dealer connections anymore, so now and then I’ll drive to somewhere I think I can cold cop (it’s worked like twice ever) drive around like an idiot, and eventually give up and go back to my regular life. Once I found someone on Craigslist but they only had coke, which I just ended up doing every day while at my corporate office job, just because it was something other than straight reality. I’ve had ECT and ketamine treatment for depression, done AA/NA, therapy, and nothing really helps to fill the gaping hole of despair. It’s like I’ll be doing okay with my life for a short while but it never really sticks. I feel like I’m living someone else’s life - a house in the burbs, a family, a dog, a decent career - and I just feel completely trapped and also like a freak. I don’t have many friends, and to this day I’ve never known anyone else who did hard drugs (outside of some NA acquaintances). 

I guess I’m just looking for any words of advice or anyone who has been in a similar place. Am I just doomed? Like even in the decent times, I think about heroin every single day. It’s like it permanently changed my brain by giving me a glimpse of the happiness that I’ll never achieve on my own. Thanks for reading.",27

I started the Bernese method 3 days ago. But I don’t dose twice I only dose sub once in the morning. I’ll wait 12 hours since last bag, then do sub. I increase each day. Yesterday I waited 12 hours, woke up did 2 mg of sub, waited an hour, did a bag. Had to do like 6 bags to be ok from PW which sucks cuz I did only 4 bags day before I was weaning down. But I had shitty quality stuff. Today i got better quality stuff but only 6 and can’t get more. I did about 3 mg of sub. Today after 15 hours & I’ll be doing a bag when I need it.

In the ‘process’ of getting help but struggling to obtain Codeine whilst I wait.,"I have been addicted to Codeine for around 4 years now and recently I approached my GP with a view to getting help in stopping taking them. I was offered no assistance by them and told to go ‘cold turkey’. Whilst I have approached my local drug service to request help in coming off the Codeine, it is taking an inordinate amount of time to receive any treatment due to their processes meaning I am forcibly being made to go cold turkey in spite of the drug service advising me it would be extremely detrimental to my health to do. This is due to the fact I’m struggling to obtain any Codeine as local and online pharmacies are refusing to sell me them owing to the frequency I buy them. I have asked the drug service if there is any possibility of them providing me with Codeine in the interim but each ‘request’ is ignored.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2

Got to day 40 before relapsing, now I’m on day 16. I even turned down opiates yesterday, so I was super proud of myself.

Bad news: I’ve come to the realization that I’m just addicted to not being sober. I’ve been smoking so much weed during this quit, which don’t get me wrong is a WAY better drug to be hooked on, so it is progress. When I got to day 40, a good majority of the time I was sober (couple drinks here and there with the homies). But this time around, every single time all my responsibilities are finished for the day I smoke. I wanna smoke while I’m typing this but I trashed my pen.

Opiates definitely started this tho, getting high every day for idk how long (been addicted for 6.5 years, but I don’t remember when it became a daily thing). They gave me the best/longest high, but in its absence I’m cool with anything that helps numb shit a bit. Thanks for reading my post that leads no where, but let’s end on a happier note.

But when it gets to the point where AA becomes your life, you become a book thumper and live a life of AA by the principles with a program i think its just bull shit.

I felt honestly so brain washed and it worked for a bit to keep me sober for a yEar. I stopped going to meetings after rehab 5 months in and replaced it with healthy activities like jiu jitsu and volunteer work.  I took the general principles behind what AA does and applied it with my hobbies.  Giving back to others, practicing gratitude and just realizing the fact that most people suffer from this shit and the stigma.

but aa is a double edged sword.  Counting days and wearing it as a badge of honor to get more cred, the house of cards falls down with your mental health being hit the hardest since it was your identity.  When in reality that slip up isn’t that big of a deal because your brain chemistry wasnt as physically dependent you are just beating your self up for the fact that you slipped up as a human being.  I really think rehabs misdiagonose many people as addicts/alcoholics and teach it as the only way for a money ponzi scheme.  when i relapsed i beat my self up real bad.  It was over .25 mg xanax. Next i took oxyS. And realized i started withdrawing after only taking them a week. Then i used Kratom to get over and was just depressed about my identity i worked a year so hard for gone.  I’m a fake i thought to myself.

i was depressed and just not being organized I n my thoughts.  I took a hit of meth and felt happiness for the first time.  I flushed the rest away after this experience and realized drugs are tools and must be respected.  when i used before i used it to self medicate, until my brain became physically dependent on them and used to feel normal.  I think the fact is this happens to everyone.  of course when you are physically dependent without the drug/alc you are restless irritable discontent.  No shit Sherlock.

&#x200B;

i followed cg kid and was surprised he was doing moderation now and is happy.  I started doing the same with my self as well.  I still dont do drugs that affect my mental health more than anything and i make sure if i take opiates i dont do it longer then a week.  after doing it again and my active lifestyle is realized i really thoguht it was over rated.

&#x200B;

this totally goes against step 1 being powerless over drugs and alcohol but for me it only applies when I’m physically dependent OR if i get to warped up in my identity as OH I’m an ADDICT/JUNKIE/ALCOHOLIC so if i take one i fucked up big time.  When i realized when i slipped up and got over the emotional turmoil i decided to partake in grabbing some xanax.  I  accidentally took meth and cleaned and reorganized a lot of things in my life it was almost spiritual and it really helped me get back on track.  The thing is nothing bad happened after and i didnt feel like taking more.  I respect drugs Now before when i had an ego and influx of money, i used drugs to cover the shame of being an addict.  

&#x200B;

Now i kinda see myself as person that was dependent on substances after long term use.  the only time shit got out of hand was when i didnt know about withdrawals and it was a cat and mouse game to not get sick no matter what and using copious poly drugs to just get my brain chemistry out of whack.

&#x200B;

i found that thorough giving back, fitness, Mma training and just vigorous exercise, socializing and the occasional gratitude prayer I’m happier then i ve ever been.  Yeah they have been hitting meetings, but i focused on my diet, my daily habits, and having a healthier lifestyle with exercise while they chain smoked cigs, sharing stories which makes them relive the past… how is that helpful?  Maybe to a newcomer that doesn’t realize that there are many of us out here.

&#x200B;

 i hated going to meetings hearing the same shit over and over again. hearing corny jokes,  hearing bullshit like one drink/slip up it always getting worse. i think its really dependent on the situation and type of drug.  Maybe if its heroin.fentanyl since the half life is so short and wd gets rampant so quick this could happen.  Maybe I’m just An idiot

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

thanks for listening to my rant.  I just heard 4 of my buddies from rehab that were heavily i in the program died while i was the odd one out that went against my rehabs advice and stuck with changing my lifestyle and going more scientific in my approach with vitamin D fish oil, exercise, natural test boosters (since opiates depleted my t) and not going to meetings to rant about the same issue.  yeah i get it i had a substance dependence issue in the past, but what use is it to reflect back to it, when i can take that time to work on doing a new hobby and getting better at it while making new friends.  Or would i d rather sit in a room of other alcholics talking about either how happy or how miserable they are with their corny ass quotes?

i been using some kind of opiate now since i think for the last at least 5 years. now i use fentanyl. i don’t even like it. i just do it so i don’t feel like shit. and of course now that’s cheaper than anything else and the only thing that makes me feel “OK”. 

my life i generally normal otherwise. i go to work, make money and usually don’t even use at all while at work. i’m a hairstylist so i just need to feel well enough to be on my my feet. 

i don’t have friends that use, i have a boyfriend that doesn’t  my family and friends knew at one time because i lost a ton of weight. now most people would have no idea unless they caught me using. 

then i think about money, and i know even my friends who aren’t addicts struggle and can’t save. i am staying with my grandma right now due to the fact i couldn’t work during covid & where i was staying essentially had to be sold last April. Sometimes i can save a bit but then work is slow send i have to compensate with what i have saved. besides work lately all i’ve been doing is staying home and doing nothing. i don’t know if this is how i would be on maintenance medication too?

i’m sorry i don’t know why i am saying all of this. in my mind sometimes i think i’m OK because i have a place to stay and have a generally normal life. 

but i really would not do any drugs if it didn’t make me feel so sick. but i don’t even know where to start. i don’t have health insurance, i don’t know if i can go to a detox or rehab since i never have before. i know i don’t want to do this anymore. but i am so very scared. i keep telling myself i’ll get sober when i’m 30. next april. I am scared to tell anyone. when i was using blues i sat down 
my grandparents and how i needed help and nothing happened. that was years ago now. & i know even if i didn’t use or had some help with sub ozone or methadone things wouldnt be perfect, but maybe i could have a little more money.   maybe i wouldn’t feel so lost. like i don’t even really like my job but i’ve never done anything else and am scared to not be able to afford my habit. 

i just want help  and i don’t know how to ask for it or find it anymore. where do i even start? do i need health insurance to get on maintenance meds? will they even work since i use fentanyl? i am so scared. 

i’m sorry for the rambling but i really don’t have anyone to talk to. i’m to scared to admit it to anyone anymore because i know i will let them down because they all think i’m “OK”. i don’t know where to start anymore. i don’t want to be scared to travel or plan around what i can afford. 


i just want this to be over. i’m so over it :(",14

yall know the drill. life is finally going good so what the fuck do i always fucking do? just go pick up one bag, nbd, right? wont shoot up, even through the shit i get is legit real dope, coming in cold no tolerence at all, snorting for me is the smartest thing to do. its when i start getting real strung out that i reach for the needle every time to 'make it last', ya fucking right. 

anyway been a week since i picked up, mainly cause work had us come in an hr early now, i live an hr away, and on a couple days i have school after 11hrs of work. i know im a huge pussy but when another hr of sleep was taken from me, plus the school work (which im totally not used to, doing the frontliners thing), i figured I'd pick up dope for some engery, keep motivates, happy, you know the deal. 

and it worked, but then i spent my three days off coming down trying to do HM, which was fucking nothing this time I had plenty of kratom, bud, and had barely used. but just those couple Gs I got have all ready light that fucking fire. I wanna pick up so fucking bad tmr, even though I know its fucking stupid. That money is better used literally anywhere. worst thing is i dont have any real 'excuse' to get it. other than i fucking love dope. love the energy, the calm, etc, etc. but just cannot afford it and thats why i self destruct every fucking time over the last 15 years. 

i like to think this time i finally got it. between kratom, bud, occasional phentibut, xans, i can pretty much get the same motivated, calm benefits of dope, but i can actually afford those. but man, its still no where near that fucking heroin high. 

rant over i guess. every day i wake up with that last snort behind me it gets a little easier to let it go. as fucked as it is just knowing that I can get it if i really 'need' it is comforting enough. like Dennis Leary in Rescue Me, he gets off pills, but keeps some in his locker, ya know, for piece of mind. idk, fucking stupid but mentally helps. i will not pick up tmr!!!!!!! there is literally no need to other than wanting to blow up when im finally getting shit together again. enough fucking times doing that retarded shit.",7

I wouldn't have believed it before, but even Netflix and reading become chores if there's really no other option to entertain yourself.

Tomorrow I have a talk with the head doctor again and by the end of the weekend I will be completely off of the diazepam they're tapering down now. I am scheduled to stay another week, but I still imagine they'll try to talk me into staying an extra fourth week.

25 years old. Got prescribed percs after a near death car accident about a year ago. Started taking them every so often when the pain was unbearable. I was aware how addicting they are and wanted to control it. They made me feel amazing, I starting taking them only when I was doing something social to counter the comedown from vyvanse. 

Fast forward, 5/6 months after I was initially prescribed, I was addicted. Taking large amounts and running out of my prescription quick, resulting in illegal means of sourcing them. 

Steadily got worse. I stopped in May for about a week with 0 withdrawal. Not sure how it happened, it just happened. 

Today, when I run out - it’s the end of the world. I usually get through my day and dose around 5/6pm. I want to stop. The mental effects of the withdrawal is what gets me going back. It’s all I can think about when I don’t have anything. I panic, and try my very best to find more. I’ve never had any physical withdrawal symptoms. They’ve always been mental. I try to lay down and I think I freak myself out and my brain exaggerates how badly I need these pills. I’ve tried Krantom but it doesn’t really help. I need to learn to cope and deal with the mental aspect and I should be able to beat this thing. I try to stay busy but as soon as I have any downtime I freak out. 

Please if anyone has some tricks or tips I’d love to hear them.",7

This is my 3rd time trying to get clean, still tired and dealing with terrible mood swings but it gets better everyday I guess except the paws.

When I was on suboxone I gained a shit load of weight and also drank a real lot adding to the weight gain. When I relapsed I stopped drinking,subs obv (I really hate booze I was just filling the void with what was available). So I lost like 70lbs in that 6 months. Always struggled with weight issues, yoyoing back and forth. I try to exercise daily now, don't get to it everyday but I'm way more active physically than my longest clean time. Not on subs at all

All I get from people minus my parents who know how I lost the weight was a steady diet of cocaine and heroin without eating, is ""wow you look great"" ""what did you do to lose all that weight so fast?"" ""Congrats what are you doing?""

I know people are just being nice and I should be happy to get a compliment but my brain is just like ""see, look how much better life is using. Go cop"" ""fuck this boring life, go have fun and you even get to look better to!"" it's fucking with me so much I'm at the point I think I might be developing an eating disorder. I don't really eat much anymore, it's almost a buzz having an empty stomach feeling. I know I'm sick in the head but has anyone thought about this?

I’ve posted here before under a different throw away and you were all so helpful. I come here again for some advice.

I discovered my partner was an addict earlier this year (Fentanyl). They’ve apparently had this issue in the past but were able to beat it. Then, about a year or so ago they just got involved with the wrong people and now we are in and out of recovery.

Thing is, I’m so used to being lied to and manipulated I’m having trouble really understanding if they’re clean or not. They finally, on their own accord, take their taper medication in front of me. I have some questions-

-My partner says they cannot take these simultaneously as they will put them in ‘precipitated withdrawal’. Is this true? What I read is mixed.
-I observe that they have small pupils, but I’ve also just become pretty high strung looking for signs. They seem to have no idea and claim it is likely from subs. Is this an effect?
-I haven’t seen many withdrawal symptoms with the exception of the gap days before they started medication. Does it really work that well, or am I just missing something?

My partner is an incredibly high functioning addict and I am so in love with them but so fearful of yet another relapse. Any info on what to look for would be so appreciated.

Thank you.",1

I’m an Australian 29 year old opioid dependent male with diagnosed in 2018 with degenerative disc disease from L1 to L4-S1.

Before being diagnosed , in 2016 , I started getting a sore back while working as a cleaner for a supermarket and I began using basic paracetamol and ibuprofen otc NSAID’s. These were not effective , so I started using codeine containing medications, which at the time in Australia , required no prescription and could be purchased every 5 days by presenting your ID and having your purchase history recorded.

After being freaked out about the potential organ damage due to the paracetamol etc, I started cold water extracting my medication so I could just drink higher dose codeine water without all the gunk it in. From time to time I would use endone (5mg instant release oxycodone) and it wasn’t long before I decided I enjoyed what this drug had to offer and the increase in my overall quality of life at both work & outside work and while playing sports .
 
When the doctors stopped prescribing the endone or panadeine fortes (highest strength codeine tablets that were script only) - I began purchasing them from other people and self dosing as I pleased. This was before I was diagnosed with DDD.

When I finally got the scans confirming the DDD, it was easier for me to get a doctor to prescribe mid dose oxycodone tablets that were 15mg oxy / 7.5 nalaxone . Unfortunately my tolerance was too high for this to be effective , and I was too afraid to be honest with my doctor in fear of being earmarked as a drug seeker for the rest of my life (they do this in Australia - your health records and prescription records are linked and monitored

my use when purchasing pills illegally  could range from 120 to 300mg a day if I felt like itnif I had it my way. After having a major accident in December 2020, my doctor put me on 2 x 30mg slow release oxy a day, meaning I could get a script every fortnight. This was life changing , as I could actually get away with making that box of 28 last 14 days , I saved sooo much money, my use decreased and my depression eased up a little and finally have me a glimpse that this is gonna work. My quality of life was fantastic and I was happy ! I was not purchasing anymore tablets outside of my script.

Fast forward this May , i was booted off the 30mg slow release and it started the shit from previous years all over again .I’ve had many many issues and hit physical and financial rock bottom after another car accident on the way to purchase pills. 

My entire family hates me , deservingly , because I’ve done some really shameful dodgey stuff, like stealing from family members and lying so I can purchase pills . 

Two months ago , the curtains were fully pulled back so to speak and all my secrets  that were kept from my family were revealed. I was given a choice, get clean or get out and leave the family business. I was pushed into seeing a psychiatrist who said yeah you gotta get off the painkillers, it’s gonna be hard, good luck. Fantastic help and learned a lot (sarcasm)

My whole quality of life has diminished to extreme lows. Im still working full time, but I’m still broke , I’m still in pain, I’m still miserable,i still have no trust from my family , and of course I am giving in once a week on average and buying pills . It makes me feel dirty , like a criminal , like a piece of shit, and worst of all keep letting my family down.

I am really confused as to what to do from here . I’m almost 30 , and every day my physicality and emotional pain gets worse and worse . Suicide has crossed my mind many of times and has been discussed with my family and professionals , but nothing has really helped . 

I basically have 2 options: keep my family  by keeping to  pretendto be happy and keep walking around with a fake smile and working with physically debilitating pain and replying “yeah all good “ when asked how things are , and live a shit quality of life 

Or other option is to keep buying pills on the side to create temporary happiness, all while knowing I’m letting my family down , ruining my finances and deleting any form of future .

I don’t have any intention of being high and doing nothing all day , this is what people around me  don’t understand . I stopped getting ‘high’ off these pills a very long time ago. All I want to do is pain free or at least at a manageable level, so I can  be as productive as I can be, help anyone around  me to the best of my ability and move on towards building. It costs a lot of energy to pretend to be happy , energy i could be directing towards something else.

I hate that I have to feel guilty about wanting to be pain free. I hate that I feel guilty admitting that oxycodone kills my pain but also puts me in a good mood and a productive mood. I hate that there is nothing else out there that is considered ‘ok / guilt-free’ that actually works . I’ve been prescribed morphine before , and it does not do what the oxycodone does for me. I don’t want to be swimming in morphine if it doesn’t work for me.

All i want is a decent quality of life and a decent level of happiness,  but I don’t think I can achieve this in this lifetime.

I want to go back to where I was stable on 2 x 30mg slow release oxy tablets every 12 hours - but the doctors have declared that’s a guilty act - my family has declared that’s a guilty act .

I’m lost as to what to do. I feel like I am being forced to live a low quality of life existence filled with physical pain and daily discontent . I cannot end my life because that’s the most selfish thing I could do to my family - I don’t want anyone I care about to experience the dysphoria / discontent I feel on an hourly basis .

Life is beautiful but I’m not allowed to enjoy it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this if you have and i appreciate any response or advise you may have.",7

I know i am weak. I did it before, 2 years ago but i was in a better place then. I tapered very slow and also used pregabalin, which i don't want again, because it was harder to quit the pregabalin and it gave me seizureing and suicidal. Now i have a stressful job who will allow me a week off, maybe 2. I really don't want to lose this job. 

I have a good support system: friends and family are offering help. My boss lets me take a paid week of without wasting my vacation days. My friends can take care of me, force me to eat and make sure i won't suffer from dehydration. My partner will be home often, but has a lot of work.. and maybe he will need some time away from me, I'm a demon towards him when i don't take my meds on time. Like really, i'm awful and i say awful things.

My doctors are not very helpful: i know in the US they give suboxone or whatever to make the WD symptoms less bad. None of my doctors want to give me anything helpful. Not even some zolpidem. So i got some from my mom. My docs say 'just taper down and you will be ok' but they don't even know how bad it is. The 'opioid epidemic' is known to few doctors over here, they don't take it seriously.

I am preparing myself mentally, but so tired. I worry about everything. I will make my partner's life hell even though i love him so much. I want it to be over now. Time will go so slow. Maybe it will take me much longer to be myself again than i hope to.

Is the WD onset quick? Is it just 4-5 days and then I am normal again, or can the anxiety stay for much longer?

Edit: please don't send me messages trying to sell me opioids. Thats a real dick move",6

Turns out I'm struggling more than I thought and now I wake up with morning shakes when I don't take them.

So I'm about 3-4 months clean, I don't do the whole counting days thing. But I'm really proud of where I'm at. I'll never do opiates again, and this time I mean it and I truly have learned to love my life sober. Even with my insane anxiety.

Which brings me to the problem. I went to the doctor cause I've had enough. Now I know this doctor just hands on Xanax to anyone, so I knew what I was doing. So I get my xans with am anti depressants. My plan was to take the antidepressant and off the xans to other pepe, maybe take them as needed. But I absolutely hate how antidepressant s feel, and the xans make me feel like the person I need to be. 

I've been fairly good about it, only taking them as prescribed  and not every day. But this last week or so was extremely stressful and I found myself taking them more than prescribed. Not all at once but as an example I'd take 4 .5 mg throughout the day vs the 2 .5 I'm prescribed, sometimes even 5 or 6, 

What's concerning me is some of those times I took them because I wanted to feel good, not cause the anxiety was I overwhelming. I never have liked the feeling of benzos, so idk what changed all the sudden. 

I started feeling like those addict tendencies were coming back, so I'm now 2 days without them again but I wanna take one cause I think I'm starting to feel withdrawals from them. I get morning shakes now and I hate it. I hate that I'm not even panicking but I still am craving them. And really it's more that I want to make my anxiety vanish. But sometimes I go overboard once I'm on them

I just needed to vent, I know no one has answers. Have a good day y'all and good luck in your recovery.",5

I have an appointment with a doctor on Tuesday to hopefully get back on a mood stabilizer I used to be on before opiates.

I feel a bit achey and restless this morning, just wondering if I set myself up to go through the same withdrawals I went through last week or if they’ll be a bit easier if I stop taking them again today?

I’m looking to get a gym membership too. I used to love swimming laps, I’m sure that exercise will help too.

I'm an ex heroin addict. I decided to get treated for my addiction in the local public rehab center. Antidepressants didnt work too much in the past and the only medication that helped me (aside benzodiazepines which they won't prescribe me for obvious reasons) was pregabalin. I quickly got set up on 150/300 mg dose (morning and evening) and then increased to 300/300.

The problem is - I quickly learned about opiate-like euphoric effects of pregabalin and their anti-anxiery effiiciacy. So I started overdosing it. I quickly started getting prescriptions by 2-3 doctors and took bigger and bigger doses. Currently I take quite massive doses which I won't even share because I''m afraid of your opinion.

Now I visited my doctor again, thought about everything a lot and decided that maybe I should try conventional therapy instead of replacing my previous drug of choice by a new one. I thought that maybe I should go back to 300/300 dose and introduce other medications that were prescribed me (naltrexone and bupropion).

But the question is - will it still work despite my massive tolerance? Should I take some break maybe? If I go back to 300/300 dose I don't expect normal effects right away. But will it go back to normal over time? Do I have to wait for this to happen a long time?",5

First off I just wanna say that y’all are my fucking heroes. I am the biggest fan of this subreddit and it’s visitors. If you have posted any post or comment in the past 6 months I’ve probably read it. 

However, even after reading countless stories, povs, tips, and experiences; I still am uncertain about my personal battle.

I wanna preface this by saying that yes, I am 1000000% sure the pills I snort are pharm. 

So I’ve been taking oxys for about 15 months. Started off with 10mg percs then sniffing 30mg oxy. I really want to quit but I don’t want to take subs or methadone if I don’t have to, and here’s why. 

I’ve never experienced the withdrawals that opiate users always experience; the vomitting, the sweating, the flu. I just get depression, RLS, insomnia and a 24/7 nagging chest tightening. I don’t know if that means the severity of my withdrawals are not that bad yet? (Trust me, it’s still very very very hard for me). 

So my tolerance for oxys is kinda rare, at least in this subreddit. I still get a very nice high from just 1 30mg oxy, even tho I prefer to take 1.5 at a time. The amount of oxy I need to get High has not increased in a long time, but i can still easily easily take 20 30s in 1 day (and I have before, it’s just not the norm; and I never take more than 2 at once). 

I want to taper off oxys, and I know it’s hard but 2 years ago I was very addicted to Xanax; and I tapered off that very easily and I haven’t touched since. So I think I have a chance. Will tapering oxys down to let’s say 2-3 a day make withdrawals much easier? Or do I need to get it even lower?

Also I have never touched heroin or fent ever. Does that mean my withdrawals will be easier than the ones that are most common in this sub?",1

What do you like to do in preparation for withdrawal?

I have a variety of comfort meds on-hand so I don’t necessarily need recommendations in that regard.

But what about vitamins, supplements, herbs?

Will starting an exercise regimen leading up to my last dose prime me for a quicker recovery?

What about starting an Ultra-Low Dose Naltrexone dosing regimen? Or taking other compounds which are claimed to reduce opioid tolerance? Will any of these begin the up-regulation of my receptors prior to my final dose?

Anything else I should research or consider trying?

Every single last doctor or rehab or detox facility has told me that even if I get completely off that I’ll need to be on something else blah blah relapse rate is 97% blah blah . I have not used in the past 5 years. Even two years ago when my newborn son died right in front of me. My doc at the clinic said that if I didn’t use after loosing him then I am headed down the right path. My problem is I don’t want to be on something else. But hey say that even if I had all the willpower in the world that if I get off methadone my biochemistry and neuroscience will work against me and I’ll relapse. Now wtf is that ?! I want opinions / stories anything really . I plan to get down to around 10-15mg and go to a center for about 60 days. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety ptsd. So it’s usually the mental fuckery after the physical withdrawals that puts me on my ass!,1

Intake on Monday morning was fine, everyone was very nice and I have a great roommate who I get along with perfectly and who doesn't snore. Jackpot in that regard.

The doctor offered me two options: either a quick taper with methadone or just management of the symptoms with plenty of diazepam and pipamperone. I chose the diazepam route with the option that I could change my mind if it got too much to handle.

The first evening was extremely rough, I was walking endless laps around the ward because of my crampy and restless legs and sweating and shivering. Also cried in the shower for about half an hour so nobody would see and almost planned to leave the next morning. 

Luckily the next day I felt better even after having only gotten about one hour of shitty sleep. The days are quite manageable, I get diazepam for every meal and can cope by going to therapy and talking to the other patients so I decided to stay and stick with the diazepam route.

Second night was shit again even though they gave me diazepam every two hours, but the days are more and more manageable.

Last night was really bad again, even though they gave me diazepam and pipamperone again I caught maybe 2h of sweaty sleep and tossed around. 

Today is again really manageable, I feel like I'm starting to get better. I still feel cold and shivery and have crampy legs, but it's much better than on day one and two.

I spoke with the head doctor again today, my blood stats look good so far and he prescribed me additional promethazine for sleep and magnesium for the cramps in my legs.

I had some acupuncture today (not a believer in that stuff, but I take what I can get) and some sports therapy (badminton) which was a lot of fun and helped with the pain in my legs.

Overall the most positive  day so far regarding the circumstances, and my parents are coming to visit me in a few hours to go on a little walk.

I am dreading the night though, I think a few more sleepless nights and I might lose my shit. Hopefully the new meds will help!

Everyone else doing ok today?",24

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer any sort of help/direction.,"So, I am trying to get on subs. I waited 4 and 1/2 days after my last use of what I believed to be fetty but who the hell knows what was actually in it. Usually, when I stop using, I'm deathly ill within 24 hours. This time, those 4.5 days had passed and I was kind of sick but no where near where I usually am. I figured waiting close to 5 days would be more than enough time to safely take subs without going into precipitated withdrawal. WRONG. An hour after taking 4mg of Suboxone, I was in full blown PWD, puking, shitting, crying, shivering, sweating, tearing my skin off, etc. So obviously it wasn't just fetty, it was cut with something with some ridiculous half-life.

Anyway, long story short, after going into PWD, I couldn't stand it anymore after about an hour. So I took out my backup bag of dope, which I prepared knowing that this PWD might happen, and snorted a shit ton until I could finally stop puking and I calmed down. 

QUESTION: now that the 4mg subs are in my system from yesterday, can I try to take them again without getting PWD sick again, or will I be in PWD hell again because I used dope afterwards and until I went to bed?

Thanks in advance.

PS any one ever waited literally 4.5 days to take subs and still get thrown into PWD hell? It's ridiculous, happens to be every fucking time, no matter how long I wait. I'm going to ask my doc for Subutex during my next appointment as perhaps maybe I'm allergic or something to the Naloxone. I doubt that's the case/I doubt that even makes sense but I'm out of answers at this point. I've waited 2 full weeks before getting a Vivitrol shot and ended up in the hospital. I've waited days and days before trying suboxone and ended up like I did above. I've waited 10 days before trying a half of a Naltrexone pill and ended up in PWD hell. I don't know what to do.",6

This is like my 60th time trying to get clean. Ive had months before CT, but this time was the hardest time. I'm 33 and each time it gets harder. Idk if its just because of my age, or length of time using, probably a combination of both.

I was hesitant to get my vivitrol shot because I kind of felt like I was losing my best friend(s) (alcohol too). Even though they both create chaos and destruction and im miserable on them. But also going through withdrawal, I want to die (literally). I felt like relapsing and doing H was my only real chance to die. And if I dont die, I just feel good. Its such warped thinking. I learned from a neurosurgeon that opiates affect the ""give a shit"" part of the brain. It's why we hurt so many people and keep doing what we do, because we just arent capable of giving a shit. But you can fight through that and your brain can recover.

So far so good with vivitrol. My ass hurts but thats about it. I got about 5-6 hours of sleep. My cravings now compared to before I got the shot is insane. Idk if thats just placebo affect or I just know I cant do an opiate, but it seems to be helping.

A mate of mine passed away recently from this stuff and unfortunately that’s been the shitty wake up call that I needed. 

Back story:

I’ve been an on and off oxy user for a bit over 2 years. I’d have stretches where I went on several month long binges and then a few weeks tea break before getting back on. My dose gradually jumped up - as everyone’s does - and I was doing about 100mg a day for the last 2-3 months. Most recently I had a tea break and went CT for just shy of a week before going on a 2.5 week long binge. 

I’m currently about to hit the 48 hour mark and I’m not feeling too bad. Tbh, I’m just pretty lethargic and flat. I’ve done cold turkey a few times before and it’s been a bit different each time, but generally speaking I’ve felt pretty good by the 4th day.

Basically I’m just wondering what withdrawals you guys think I should be expecting and whether you think PAWS will get me or not?

I didn’t touch heroin until I was 27. I was always an addict but didn’t develop a full blown physical addiction til then.

I’ve always heard a saying that a person’s emotional maturity can be stunted when they start to use drugs, or at least once their life starts to heavily revolve around drugs. In my personal experience and from what I’ve witnessed, I believe this to be true in a lot of cases. Which is why I think it was a little easier for me to get sober and why my addiction didn’t last as long as it did for many (I’m in my early 30s now). Obviously this isn’t true for everyone, as there is a lot of factors involved that cause a person to turn to drugs (abuse, trauma, deaths of loved ones, etc) as well as not get help (lack of accessibility to treatment, no support system, socioeconomic factors, and much more). 

It saddens me to see so many people develop full-blown addictions to opiates in their teens or early 20s. I feel like it’s rare to see people get clean before they reach 25-30.

Just here to say that life is fucking beautiful when you get clean and a MILLION times easier to manage.

If you’re reading this and struggling to get clean, take that leap. It definitely isn’t easy. However once you get distance from it and see how much better life is without it, you won’t go back. ❤️ super thankful for everyone on here who shares hope, I know it helped me.",36

Riding the pink cloud.","Yesterday marks 30 days clean from meth and heroin. And today marks 1 year since my nephew Kai started his journey to the next life. One year ago I experienced a loss and a heart break like never before. Holding him, holding my sister mourning over his tiny but chunky perfect body was something I’ll never forget. The trauma, the grief, the resentment, it fueled my addiction and my coping mechanisms were all fucked up. I wish I did better and figured it out then what I know now. I pray my sister will forgive me. And pray Kai will too when I see him again one day. One month later I had my first drug overdose. Pulled out of my car dumped on the road in November downtown at 11 pm. Found blue by some random man and came to, to find my car gone, and an officer and strangers surrounding me in shock. I went over a decade of being an opiate addict and never overdosed once. After leaving the hospital dope sick what did I do? Searched to find my car ransacked all of my things gone. 5 miles left in the tank. I knew I wouldn’t make it home so I went to the gas station to hopefully find anyone I knew being my phone was also stolen. I managed to find a crumpled up $20 under my seat. Imagine what happened next. Insanity. $5 in the tank $15 to get right. After just almost dying. The shame took over. Went to detox for the 4th time in 2 years. I went to mashkawisen. Hoping to amend the relationship lost with my sister bc I chose to get high over being there for her after the death of her son. My nephew. She hated me I don’t blame her. I did NOT complete treatment. I left early. Stayed clean for a short while but then was back in it... Full force. Pick up where you left off they say. Finally I made the choice to go to detox after private investigators were at my house looking for a loved one of mine Ricky who had been missing... I heard rumors and it scared me to know I knew people capable of such atrocities. I went to detox again, I got out to find out the rumors were true. He was murdered. Dismembered. Gone. His words replayed over and over about his lecturing me over being a hot mess and “this isn’t you Amanda, please do something to get better because I’ll never forget when I first met you in a trap house basement all done up in a sun dress wondering what you were doing there. You are better than this and this ain’t you” His murderer and the accomplices had all been close with him, that’s how I met them. That terrified me. Death had been too prevalent this past year. His life meant something to me so much that I wanted to get clean so his life wouldn’t go in vain. I chose to live. I checked into pioneer recovery and heroin had me by the balls still, I ended up overdosing AGAIN when I left for a week like an idiot because the temptation was still there. I checked back in, and yet again overdosed. Two weeks within each other. The last time I shit you not I saw the light. Scarier than the last. They hit me with Narcan more than once, I wasn’t breathing. They thought ‘brain damage’ about to call 911 I came to. Remembering what just happened. While overdosing I was too close to dying. I saw light, memories, replaying meeting my plug. Thinking “how am I asleep I was just in the front seat of a car?” I came to. Checking my pulse. Thinking I died died. Thinking of my sons. Thinking how badly I want to live. I want to live for them, and I want to do better. Be better. I went back to pioneer fessed up, turned my phone in, made it to every group. Graduated with flying colors. I’m doing 90 meetings in 90 days. I’m flourishing because I choose life. Too much grief and too much loss. Too much death knocking on my door and I can’t die over no drugs. Fuck that. I got better shit to do. This time I can’t make promises but for today I will remain sober and not use and for that I am grateful. I hope I can repair the damage I’ve done. One day at a time. Thanks for reading if you did. I needed to show the severity of my what feels like my life long battle with addiction. I want to end the stigma. And have a voice. I will be a better me today, tomorrow, from now on.

My goal is to get off opiates. As someone with chronic pain, I want to taper down using opiates (just the minimum, not to get high) until my intake is low enough to jump.

I’m hoping to taper down my opiate intake using the *minimum* to get by with extended release morphine.

Ive been taking short-acting pills like oxycodone and hydrocodone for a few months. My intake varies so much but on a “low” day it’s about 300mg oxy. I could probably manage with a bit less than that without feeling like shit. I’ve never taken a pressed pill, 100% sure of it, please don’t waste my time or yours challenging that. I pay $40 a pill and go through all kinds of shit to ensure they’re always legit.

At this time I ran out of oxy and only have morphine extended release pills. They’re 15mg (blue with RD 70 imprint) and I have a little over 60 of them (I can probably get some more but not sure how many).

I want to taper down my usage as best as I can - as quickly as I can tolerate, and I want to use these morphine pills to do so. 

I mostly just need to make it through 3-4 days until I can afford to get some more. But in these 3-4 days, I’d like to get on track with starting the taper. 

The problem is I don’t really know how to take these. I don’t exactly know what my “minimum” dose would be. I usually only take them at night so that I don’t wake up sick, and I’ll usually take 2, sometimes 3. Sometimes I’ll take a couple during the day to help me so I don’t take as much oxy. There was one time when I was sick and had nothing so I chewed up 6 of them and I started feeling well in about an hour.

For reference, if it helps: To get (just) well in the morning, I take 60mg oxy. I could maybe get by with an little less but I’ve never needed to find out. 

I just want some info or some kind of idea for a plan on how to use these because I have no idea how to do this. I was thinking something like I’d wake up, take 4, wait an hour to see how I feel, take 2 if I feel WDs, repeat.. but I don’t know how long these take to kick in and I don’t want to end up finding out that I took too much. I also don’t want to not take enough and then need to wait hours and hours until I get well. But I assume there will be some trial and error.

I suppose I could chew them which I think will make them kick in faster but that isn’t ideal for me.

Anyone have any insight on how to proceed with these?

**Tl;dr** - Coming from oxy (at least 300mg/day), how can i properly dose morphine extended release, taking just the minimum to get by, in an effort to taper down my intake.",1

I must say I miss opiates all the time. They were definitely my drug of choice. I still have a collection that I keep for just comfort reasons I suppose. I've quit a few times in the past but nothing lasting as long as a year since I started taking prescription opiates in 2007. I never did H, was around it but knew with my love of opiates I would grow to love it sooo much that I didn't want to go down that path of problems. Always been strong willed like that with certain things. They never messed up my professional life and I actually succeeded at a lot while going through the depths of my addiction. My personal life however, is about half way good to go. I often wonder how life would have been if I never got in the car wreck back then that introduced me to opiates. I wonder how my relationships would be with friends, how would they be romantically? Would I be married now? Girlfriend? Would I have kids now? Lots of asking the 'why' question these days.

Kratom served its purpose with helping me get off prescription opiates, however, I simply replaced them with Kratom and it became my new normal. Better from the alternatives I suppose. If used correctly I still believe Kratom to be a good and helpful plant. It has in the last few years gotten a little to commercialized for my taste though. It took me from having a habit where I had to snort 1x-2x Roxi 30mg and pop another couple to just get out of bed in the morning. Then proceeded to whatever other opiate pill I had on hand throughout the day along with many other substances. I’m definitely a poly-substance abuser when it comes to drugs. I tried quitting with Kratom in the past but kept going back to pills after a while. Mainly because well let's be honest they are better in the recreationally but really because they were easily accessible. This was back when pills were what they were supposed to be. Fentanyl was never a thing like it is today. Sure, I came across the patches here and there but never to the extent that pills have gotten today. Crazy that today you have to watch out for Fentanyl because it’s literally in EVERYTHING. Really thankful that if I was going to go down the path I did I was able to during a time where I didn’t have to be worried about what I was doing so much like kids have to be today. Another major thing was that I had a job where I was making so much money that it never hurt my finances. I am a functional addict and that sometimes can be a lot worse because you don't see how bad off you are really. 

I still have several substance issues to work on (another story for another day unless you really want to know) but opiates were a huge part of my drug problem. I consider it a big win and hope to look back at this and say it's been two years next year this time. 

To those who are in need of hope, encouragement, have questions or just need to chat feel free to hit me up. I am happy to assist others along in their journey to quit.",23

I've always been a recreational user of substances but never addicted. The first time I used an OC/80 was in 2002 in Michigan. When I moved to Florida they stopped making those and started making instant release 30 mg. By 2016 I moved to Phoenix Az. I attempted to get a roxy 30 when I moved there and got really sick for 24 hours after using just half of it. My roommate at the time said it was my tolerance and I knew better. He ended up taking a quarter of it and drug testing himself the next day. Much to my surprise he came in my room with the test showing me it was positive for fentanyl which I had never even heard of at that point. Soon after is when all the stories started on the East Coast of the hot bags and so many deaths with fentanyl involved. Weird to say but the cartels did a pretty good job of keeping every pill the same potency. Obviously sometimes you could tell the difference but I never once ODed and I was also mixing it with Xanax and prescription Klonopin everyday. Of course at the start I only needed a few day and they were cheap. But by the end of 4 years I was doing 10 a day and stretching those out with benzos in between. I tried to quit fentanyl so many times just like oxy or roxy's in the past but even 2 weeks or more clean I would relapse. I did things like giving my cash cards to my girlfriend and having her watch my phone in the middle of the night but I would always find a way and in the end I would just cash app him and he would drop it in my car for the next day when I went to work as I would stay a few pills ahead at all times. After what seemed like my 100th relapse a friend I knew took me to the methadone clinic. I had read so many bad things about it not only on here but on other forums and new I didn't want to be tethered to that for my life either. They started me at 30 mg. I was allowed to get 10mg more that day but I was still so sick. I was still doing the blues/fent while using the methadone because I would be sick and I was trying to get them to up my dose every day. Once I got up to 160 mg and told my doctor I still felt like shit she told me I absolutely needed to just detox a few days from there and step onto the methadone. Eventually I ended up doing it. It still took a lot of relapses after that. Therapy with the right counselor definitely helped me so much. In the last year I went from 160 mg to zero. I haven't had a dose since Tuesday at a half a milligram jump off. I felt very normal for the first two days so I figured there would be nothing from such a long taper at the end. Day three and four have definitely been socially anxious days and my head will not stop sweating. But that's $280.00 a month in my pocket now. I learned so much about myself through the therapy sessions. I lost the love of my life because of it all. But in the long run I ended up learning how to love myself which I never understood what it really meant. Even before addiction I was seeking praise and attention always having to have a girlfriend and never being along. It could have been from growing up in the foster care system or not parents. Either way I live on my own now and I absolutely love it. I'm not looking to get into any relationship and I'm so happy about that. I'm so happy to work on myself and see the changes the every day. I just always felt like after all those detoxes with this sweaty phone in my hand swiping through Reddit post after post about people trying to figure out how to get through it and that someday I would come here and post that I made it through. I was a highly functioning addict with a good job and I have no family or anyone that will ever find out about this. Nobody really knows about my journey and everything I've been through. I know many of you have been through this same thing. For those of you relapsing I just say please be careful. From what I can tell most of the m30s across the nation right now are fentanyl. It would be terrible to relapse on what you would think was oxy and turned out to be fentanyl. No one deserves to go like that. This forum has been very helpful to me and those dark times I felt like committing suicide and there was no one else who felt what I was going through. I never went to NA or a meeting. It just wasn't my thing nor is religion which is why I skipped it although I know there is a secular NA now. If you're struggling just know it'll get better but it doesn't get better right away. It's so easy to say it was this surgery or this person and that's how I got addicted.. But through therapy I really realized that what I think most of us are doing  ia killing pain that's actually mental. When you take away the pain relievers.. You're still left with all that mental pain. Counseling and therapy helped me through this. It wasn't the first two therapists either.. It took almost a year at the clinic until I found someone I could actually talk to and take advice from. I would say my favorite thing about being sober is that I've been able to grow out my nails which I never done my entire life due to anxiety from being in foster care since I was 4 years old. I don't have anxiety anymore. Also when I listen to music I get such intense goosebumps everyday. I call it getting my feels back. It's almost like a drug in itself. Sorry for the long post but it was a long struggle.  I'm happy to be on the other side. Changing my diet was also a huge part of how I felt. Also realizing I had an addiction to spending money even when I wasn't buying drugs was a big eye opener. Thanks for all your guys's posts and advice. It definitely kept me from going to the methadone clinic for the rest of my life. I wish all of you the best of luck, reach out if you want to.",10

My dosage has been all over the place over the years, but recently I’ve been around 15mg-30mg of hydro a day.

So far I’m feeling pretty okay. My legs are starting to act up, but I’m currently in a very hot bath with some lavender epsom salt which helps. 

Trying to keep my head in the right place and stay positive with my eye on the prize. Reminding myself that I’m not gonna feel good or normal for a few days-a week, and likely that I’ll feel gross as fuck but it’ll pass.

I’ve never succeeded CT before but after trying to find clinics to help and failing and an appointment with a bad doctor that was very condescending and told me, “if you could quit you would have done it already” I am fueled with spite to prove them wrong lol.

I’m not interested in subs, the withdrawals from that terrify me, especially bc I’m on such a small dose anymore.

The only comfort meds I have are tizanidine (a muscle relaxer similar to clonidine) that helps me sleep sometimes, and I know someone who has a kpin script for panic attacks that I might could ask for a little of if things get bad enough. I also have some prescription nausea meds from a couple months back

Here’s to hoping after 72 hours things look up

I’ll happily take any other advice anyone has to help make it through :)",17

Since that’s the case will they both show up as the same thing on a drug test?

The reason I ask is I have a prescription for Flexeril but it doesn’t do anything for pain, and I have Soma but don’t have a prescription but it does help tremendously with pain. 

Right now just laying down hurts and moving even just a little hurts. If I happen to walk a short distance I am hunched over limping slowly the whole way.

I got accepted into a Suboxone program and the rules are I go in everyday for a week straight no later than 1 pm and get my dose for the day and after a clean test after doing that for a week I get take homes so I don’t have to drive half an hour to the place and another half hour back.

As long as you have a prescription for something you’re fine. For example I tested positive for Benzos and I brought in my prescription for my clonazepam and was fine. 

I have a prescription for Flexeril, will Soma and Flexeril both test for the same so I can use soma and just show my Flexeril prescription or do they show up completely different on a test?",1

So like a lot of us in here me an my fiance have been taking the pressed 30s for about 6 months give or take. We are both really ready to quit these awful things an get our life back before eveything is gone. This coming Friday my mom is going to take the kids for the weekend or longer if needed and we are going to more less lock ourselves in the house an go through it.  We both have pretty good jobs so don't really plan to go full cold turkey(dont have the time) just long enough to where we can start using subs. I have a few questions. I have access to 90 600 mg gabbapettin and some 50mg tramadol the person helping me with the gabbapettin told me they help the most if you start to take them a week or so before you plan to stop the opiates to let them build up... has anyone else herd this or know from experience? I know they help at night with the jerks but if taking enough do they help in other ways? Also, would it be  of any benefit to start microdoscing subs now kinda like the bernesse method  To have subs built up on the receptors before the weekend and then when we stop all other opiates completely Maybe the time that we would need to wait before the subs will do what they are supposed to and keep us from being sick would be shorter then if we just stop on Friday and wait  3 or 4 days before we try to take a sub and hope that they don't put us into precipitated withdrawals? Any help an personal experience will help and thank you for your time in advance. Really tired of living like this 😪 hope everyone that is trying to beat this shit finds success",3

I feel better today (not completely depressed and run down) so I went for a bike ride and started cleaning. They interjected bullshit regarding everything I was doing and started saying I was high.

I was cleaning the table because it had a bunch of crap on it. High. I took my laundry out and started folding clothes. High. I shaved and put a couple band-aids on my sores. High.

They yell at me every time I'm productive. They yelled at me for applying for a job near the city that is up my ally (Engineering/IT). Last night they were bitching at me that I was staying up too late. It was 10pm and they were sitting up too. Blamed it on me being high. 

When I get pissed they threaten to call the cops because ""I'm high."" Because you know, getting mad at them for talking shit to me all day means I'm high.

I've been going to see this girl down the road. Every time I go there they get all up in my business and when I come back they accuse me of being high.

I decided to leave them out of my personal business because they fuck everything up for me. Bring girls here they throw them out and tell me to go see them. When I leave they start shit because I leave.

It's like they think they are helping me by treating me like a child.

I need to get my car fixed so I can go get meds at a recovery clinic. It's off Hillsborough in Tampa. Apparently coming up with ways to prevent me from getting my license back is helping me.

My grandpa fucked up the front end of my car and blamed me. It needed clips, like $10. He pulled out a drill and cracked the front end by bolting it in directly through the fiberglass and into the radiator and frame. Of course, him cracking the front end of my car was because I was high

I have chronic heart issues. Tachycardia and I get light headed and sick when I get over worked. Obviously my medical condition is because I'm high

Some crack head dude was walking up and down the road last week. They were yelling at me for some dude I don't even know. Most of my friends are professionals and engineers or scientists. 

I told them I need a dopamine and norepenephrin reuptake inhibitor (Wellbutrin). They bring home some retarded ass antidepressant that would make me sick.

I do have some problems but they do absolutely nothing to help me. They got me Suboxone prescription several months back and it helped while I had it. It expired and obviously went into withdrawal from not having the meds anymore. They think they are somehow more educated on the medical problems I have than I am.

Mostly oxycodone - some occasional fent when they were pressed. Before this I was a poly drug user for about 3 years and got addicted/OD’d on Oxy. Got clean for about a year and a half then went back. Any advice to kick the withdrawals the fastest despite how bad it may suck? For instance - would going out and running 3-4 miles each day make it go by faster? Anything I can take over the counter (non narcotic) that would help? I have vitamin c and multivitamins right now.

I dont want to do it anymore.. like a lot of us it started with taking a couple at the weekend, now for the last 2 years iv been taking them daily :( 

I GENUINELY dont do them anymore to get high… I do them because the withdrawal terrifies me! I went through withdrawal 2 years ago when i was came off of taking 10 a day and that was bad enough, so to come off them now from taking 34… Im worried Ill die. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice? Is there anything in particular that helps? Id rather not use Kratom in case that caused another addiction. 

I see people speaking about dirty 30s - is this DHC? Is it harder to come off fentanyl, Heroin and oxy etc than coming off DHC? 

Sorry for all the questions… even though iv been using DHC for 2-3 years, Im basically a noob to the drugs/medication scene. So again, I am sorry for all the questions and sorry if I have offended anyone.
