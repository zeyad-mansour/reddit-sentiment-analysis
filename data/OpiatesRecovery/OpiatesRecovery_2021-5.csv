Major accomplishment since he normally used every 2-3 hours. I'm so proud of him.  He has been microdosing suboxone since last Saturday (was still using during that time) and is taking several prescribed comfort meds. So far his symptoms and cravings have been manageable and I'm cautiously optimistic that he can stay clean this time (first time he has tried getting off with MAT). Two tips we learned in the last few days: Hyland's Restless Leg tablets and an acupressure mat are doing wonders to help with the crawling skin sensations. Just thought I'd share since I've been reading that this is one of the most annoying/uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. Fingers crossed I can make more progress posts about his experience. Good luck to any of you reading this who are trying to get off this stuff.

I'm ""only"" on 2 - 3 x 100 mg Tilidine retard. That's around the minimum you'd possibly even get prescribed for the ""mildest of strong"" pain. Before that, I've already taken it occasionally for 3 - 6 months. It's not really the dose that a typical recreational user would take, which would be higher and NOT retarded (the retarded pills are basically splitting the already low dose over 12 hours).

The reason why it's hard to stop is that I'm also depressive. When I realised it got bad again, I tried to get back on my previously prescribed SSRI, several times, but couldn't take the very strong side effects and the long delay before it works (can be 4 weeks!).

At that point, before any serious addiction, I went to my GP as well as to my psychiatrist. They both said it can be fixed, but I'll be OUT for a month, and then I'll be ok. But I had obligations, both for family and job, both in a crisis.

So I couldn't take their advice, and instead used / abused the Tilidine as an instant-anti-depressant. It works great like that! Better than a real one, without the side effects. And at that low dose, without any serious side effects at all, full focus and everything. But the problem is that the euphoria-aspect that causes the anti-depressant effect stops after a while. (As a painkiller for chronic pain, as intended, it's probably great even long-term.)

Now this ridiculously low dose of Tilidine prevents me from taking the required antidepressants, and when I try to stop the Tilidine first, I have my original depression & anxiety ON TOP of the one that comes with the withdrawal.

Doctors are up to date; next week will have consultations again and ask for solutions. I'll also open up to my workplace soon, no matter how they react. Still open for feedback & suggestions!

p. s. btw, the crisis management on opioids worked out great! My important project at work finished successfully, and I got the rest of the family through everything. Just need a way out for myself, now.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9170362949371338}"

Today is both me and my boyfriends 21 months clean date. It's insane, before this time the longest I ever made it was like 2 weeks. And I was in rehab during that entire 2 weeks. This time has been SO different. It's like something finally clicked.

My story is similar to a lot of other people's. I started using pills in 2008 when I was 18, due to a medical condition. Was prescribed perc 5s and 10s for a few months and then just stopped suddenly when my dr just thought I didnt need them anymore. I had NO clue that they were addictive or that my body could become physically dependent. I thought I was dying the first time I felt withdrawls. That turned into me buying them on the streets, which progressed to OC 80s basically right away. Did those until it changed to OPs then switched to 30s. (When they were all still oxys and not the pressed ones). Then once that got too expensive and some of the pressies came out I switched to snorting dope in 2013-2014. I was a functioning addict that whole time. Had a nice house, a great job, no one knew about my problem besides my bf (now my ex), my dad, and my dealer lol But I finally picked up a needle in 2015 and that's when everything turned to shit.

Started shooting fentanyl shortly after and lost everything. Lost my job, my place, my friends/family, & started living in my car. Then had a rough few years until I unexpectedly got pregnant in 2019. I had been to rehab around 25 times before and always relapsed. But this time, it was different & wasn't about me anymore. Before I always thought I was only fucking my own life up. But now, I had a little boy who relied on me & needed his mom and dad. So we both started MAT and the last time either of us have used was August 30th, 2019.

The last 21 months haven't been easy, but it's been SO worth it. Now I'm currently 19 weeks pregnant with our second child. And we're all happy, healthy, and living an entirely different life now. It's crazy to think about the shit I've been through. It feels like a past life and I can't believe I lived like that for over a decade. I also know I'm an addict for life so I could relapse anyday, but I still take things one day at a time and I know at least today I won't use.😊",22,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7321198582649231}"

I typed this up with the hopes that someone might have a tip on pain relief for an abscess because right now being only I am currently 33 hours sober I keep wanting to go buy something.

I am 38 weeks pregnant. I got clean thanks to methadone when I found out I was pregnant. I have been using just pain pills for 14 years because I had 2 kids under 2 (they are actually Irish twins they are 11 months apart). I began using H about a year ago when t became harder to find killers that didn’t have fenyt in them. I OD’d my one and only time on a 30mg oxy with fenyt in it and I was not told it was a fake oxy until I mentioned it to the person who sold it to me. I switched to H after that and one day I. began feeling sick and took a test and found out I was pregnant at 11 weeks and I’m went to the methadone clinic and worked on getting clean. 

Then when I hit 6/7 months pregnant I began to have problems with my back and hips and was diagnosed with something called SPD. My doctor didn’t really didn’t believe me with the pain. My dumb ass couldn’t stop thinking about how a pain pill would make the pain go away, so I tried to look for a real one and my old dealer gave me a g of H for free after he seen how much pain I was in. (I hid my pregnancy) all it took was snorting one small ass line  and the pain went away and I was able to walk and sit and do normal things again. So my dealer gets this new stuff after he came up to my car and surprised me before I could hide my stomach and he immediately stopped giving me white China or China white (wtfever it’s called) and switched over to something he claimed was stronger and better. The first g was on him because it was new shit and it was good, it had coke mixed in with it because it made my teeth numb. But every bag after that had the same taste it does when I snort it (I have never shot up I have only snorted H). That stuff would make me very ill like within 6/12 hours of not having it I would begin throwing up and go into full blown withdrawals even with the methadone. 

I kept trying to get off it but was worried about my baby every time I threw up because of the violence behind throwing up and how bad my withdrawals came on. The odd thing is that last month my drug test at the methadone clinic is clean I’m assuming because if it’s not I have to take a second one. The first month I used the pink shit they said I had coke and H and opiates in my system and all I did was the pink stuff. I have to call my councilor at the clinic tomorrow and I’m going to ask about my drug screen but I only had one drug test this month and my second one was supposed to be last week and when I asked if I needed to go upstairs to test they smiled and said no you’re good. 

I got a little bit of the pink on Thursday and finished it on Friday and Friday just go straight H because I’ve detoxed from H using methadone before and was able to do it. I wouldn’t do big enough lines to get me high I would make a line that would get me high and cut it into 3 lines. Just enough to keep me from throwing up and would only do a line when I began to feel nauseous. 

I DID MY LAST LINE YESTERDAY MORNING AT 6AM AND HAVEN’T HAD ANYTHING SINCE!! It’s been28 hours and counting!! I am spacing my methadone through out the day I take 20 mg every 2/4 hours because my body is burning it off fast. I have felt nauseous but it comes and goes I can’t seem to stop eating and my babygirl is handling it well. I have a fetal Doppler and her heart rate is great! 

The only thing is I haven’t been to sleep since yesterday about 3/4pm and I can’t seem to get tired and I’m nursing an abscess tooth which the addict part of me keeps saying just get something it will stop the pain. 

I actually tried last week on Tuesday to go to the hospital and I was honest with them because I wanted to be admitted to deal with the withdrawals there and was turned away even with my due date coming up. That’s when I took matters in my own hands and weaned myself off.

I know drugs are a means to cope and escape but I had many issues before this and never used it as a coping strategy. I’m partly attributing to being on lockdown for 9 months due to COVID and that perhaps my lonileness just got really bad and I could no longer manage it. People have different drugs of choice and oxy is like the feel love drug. You feel warm and safe. I dunno maybe fear of the change that my life was taking and the lonilness finally did it. This is not excusing my choices please don’t take this as me going it’s not my fault I take full responsibility but there are always underlying reasons for this. If your reading this and your think well this is just obvious please note I have never had any addiction before in my life so for me and the people around me this is brand new.

I've been taking opiates legally prescribed for 20+ years.  At my highest dose I was on 240mg of Oxycontin & 40mg of Oxycodone a day. However I am no longer on that THANK GOD.  I switched over to Morphine Sulfate Er. I weaned myself down from 240mg Morphine Sulfate Er a day to 15mg Morphine Sulfate Er twice a day. This past week I've lowered that to 1 pill a day. This wasn't like in the past month or anything I've weaned myself down over years and years. 

 I took my last dose at 5/29 @ 6:30pm. It is now 5/31 4am. 22 hours and I've not taken another dose. 

I haven't taken any since. I have ONLY had an upset stomach & a little bit of anxiety. No RLS, No body aches, No yawning, no hot & cold flashes etc etc.. Surprising the most NO CRAVING.  

I'm having a hard time understanding why this is.  Bc the half life according to Google is 4-12 hours. I'm well past the 12 hour stage & I'm just a little uncomfortable. Nothing major yet and it's weirding me out. 

I've been thru WITHDRAWAL before during my highest dose and lemme tell you it is literally what I think hell is.  I've had cancer,  lymphectomy, full bowel obstruction. The lymphectomy surgery alone is insane.  They pulled out all my organs from my abdomen to get to the lymph nodes and then carefully put them back in. A month later I was back in surgery due to complications of that surgery which caused the full bowel obstruction using the exact same incision scar from sternum to groin.  For the entire month they couldn't figure out what was wrong and I was in agony for the entire month.  

I couldn't keep anything down.  I lost 55lbs. At the time I was 135lbs & went to 80lbs. I was in such bad pain I had a pca pump with Morphine & a shot every 2 hours with more Morphine. 

The reason I'm telling you all this is to give an idea.  I would take all that pain over the withdrawals in a heart beat. I've not taken ANY kratom either. I just weaned myself this past week to 1 pill & then quit taking them. 

I should be pretty heavily into withdrawal.  Is there something I'm missing.  I know Methodone & Suboxone the withdrawals start about 2-4 days later can last up to a month.  I've never taken those either.

I have a date coming up on this coming Wednesday and I decided it would go better if I bought opiates. My connect told me he had carfentanyl pills (Canadian green goblins) and I figured I’d buy one and split it up into sections, take one tonight to test my tolerance and save the other half for the date night to take my anxiety away. 
I spent the last of my money on it only to find out it says “80” on one side, and “ON” on the other side. This is odd because the green goblins are labeled “CDN” not “ON”. So I begin sucking the coating off and quickly realize it’s really oxycodone but it’s Extended Release formula as the pill turned into a gumball type texture really slimy too and sticky. I ate half of the pill an hour ago and I don’t feel high. Ate the other bit as well and nothing.

My head is killing me. I know, considering some of the withdrawals I have read about, it could be so much worse and these are mild but it is stopping me from doing anything productive. The dreams have also started, when I quit after 9 months I had dreams of oxy where I could actually feel the tablet in my hand. I am getting to the point where I’m looking at my last actions when I really wanted oxy and where I am now and disgusted by how I let this happen a lot quicker than last time. It took at least a month last time when I first quit. I think I’m feeling a bit sorry for myself atm. There is so much I’m trying to understand about my addiction and trying to remind myself to “play the tape all the way through” it’s not just one night of escaping or one last time it’s either a permanent addiction or nothing.

\~

*I remember when I first met you. You turned plain towns into circus tents, with cotton candy and a kaleidoscope of colors all raining down on me. This, this, I thought, was how things were supposed to be. With you, I felt like only the very best parts of me, the big top music sure did drown out all of the ugly (all of the rest of me). As the shows went on and on, my attendance never wavered- no I came to watch and clap for the elephants and lion tamers every single day.*

*Soon, though, things began to seem amiss- I think I first began to notice when you doubled the price of admission tickets, until my pockets were always empty. So, I had to give up more and more of me, give up every, every,* ***everything*** *just to keep attending.*

*Then, one day I walked by one of the beloved elephants I always screamed and cheered for...and a gust of wind toppled it right over...all along they had been made of cardboard. I had the most terrible epiphany at that moment- you were never honest. You wooed me with your house of mirrors that were just reflective stickers laid onto Styrofoam.*

*God, how my throat choked then... how had I never suspected, even once before?* ***You were never honest.*** *You were an evil force that wanted to run me off of my projected, intended course. I have given more than I knew I could lose just to be hooked on your despondence like I was Hooked On Phonics. And now I've ruined myself to stay and play here, in this fabricated wasteland that I always thought was real.*

*None of this inauthentic circus was ever real, how well I know this now. And oh, how I wish I had just left the day I realized that. But your sad face clowns danced all around me, begging me, fooling me, manipulating the hole in me to stick around and watch the ""show"" that was just a tattered old film reel looping on a projector. The darkness seeped so easily inside of this vulnerable and broken girl, swinging through the sky (but only in her mind) on a wretched tilt a whirl. I never wore a harness.*

*The thing that's proven to be the hardest is detaching myself from the way the colors and the lights seemed  to absorb all of my pain...to make peace with the fact that all the promises you made that led my eyes to glisten... you never planned on keeping even a single one of them.*

*Sadly, too, I've spent my life learning from you, so I have made many, many promises of that very same nature since I met you. I thought I'd never have the strength, but I have* ***finally fucking left you.***

*Now? Now, I am working on keeping my word, keeping my soul; because the circus life was only ever a figment of my imagination that made me less and less whole, every day.*

*I will always love the big top, but these days I'm trying to teach myself how to quell my thirst for that which will only destroy me. I'm trying to fight my hunger for that which is only fantasy, insincerity, tragedy and calamity: you.*

*I will create my own light show, if I miss yours too much. I am sure there are much brighter ones, just past the other side.*",34,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9655581712722778}"

My depression made me fall to my lowest point in life especially being around so much oxys, lean & weed I let it take me under. Being deep in these streets took a toll on me specially everything I’ve gone thru in life. From growing up poor in the projects to abuse in my household. All I ever wanted to feel for the first time in my life was to feel alive, feel normal & less depressed when I started to get my money up. That’s where I fucked up. Got real depended on opiates to the point my body can’t function w/o it. It’s still hard but I’m making progress. Started off wit a real bad lean addiction pouring up 4-6 ozs every day to hopping on percs & Oxys off & on for bout 2 years to the point I was running on 90mgs (3 30mg blues) worth of oxys every day for the past year. I OD’d about 4 times nearly killing me. Not until the bad experience I had accidentally taking fentanyl recently. Was trying out some K9 blues to re up. Shoulda known seeing the color a slight bit off. I first licked it & it tasted fine. Chewed a little piece & still wasn’t convinced. And like the dumbass I am didn’t realize it was fent until I snorted half to see if it would hit me. & boy that muthafucka knocked me out cold. mind you I’ve never done a fake pill till that day. The feeling was the strongest shit I’ve ever felt in my life. It was so bad, I felt my soul leave my body as it was slowly shutting down on me. Absolutely the most uncomfortable feeling I’ve ever felt. Couldn’t breathe or even keep my eyes open. Went into a minor seizure & my body got really irritated like it had caught a bad reaction & felt like I was slowly dying had it not been for Narcan I probably would’ve been dead who knows. The experience I felt I vouched to never ever come near that. I’m usually not scared to die cause I done been shot at close range, had all types of guns upped on me, beaten by bats & crowbars & all that. How I felt at that moment mentally was so low, disappointed in myself that I let that happen but fuck it, it happens to the best of us. I personally hate Heron or Fent with a passion. I’ve lost couple close friends to it. That was my wake up call to stop fuckin around wit these drugs before I end up dead. Made me not want to come near another pill again so that’s when i vouched to quit somehow. I’m down to atleast 30mg a day (taking 5mg every 4 hours so I don’t withdraw). Doesn’t sound like much but that experience made me realize this ain’t the life for me anymore. I don’t want drugs to run me. I don’t wanna ruin my life even more especially over no damn pills. Hopefully soon I’ll quit 100% to the point I can feel high off soberness.

It blows my mind how many people are caught up in the game and come here for support after such a short period of time using, it’s amazing. I never considered getting clean until I was in too deep and by that time there was no option but to keep going. I wish I had known about this group or even if Reddit existed when I was only a few years in.

Regardless reading certain posts and going through personal issues make me wonder about the future sometimes. The possibility of injury, pain, illness is very real in this world and my biggest goal is to continue to live a happy opiate free life.

Dec 7th will be 30 months clean from opiates, I have been experiencing a lot of pain this past week and thought it could be some type of of pinched nerve, or pulled muscle. Of course my hypochondriac self always thinks to the worst possible conclusion which is cancer. Yesterday I noticed a rash and self diagnosed my self as having shingles but doing research it’s not common for people my age (30) to get them. The internal pain radiating from my back to my chest was so severe this morning I went to an urgent care despite me knowing they were gonna blow it off like it’s just some common injury. When I took off my shirt she said wow, you are one of the rare cases, definitely the youngest person I have ever seen with shingles. She came back a minute later and was just puzzled as to why. Apparently it comes back and flares up due to stress and having a compromised immune system. 

I went out and told her immediately I use to IV and use lots of opiates from 18-28 so my body has been abused but am clean now. It felt really good to hear her words of support and wishes for continued sobriety. Of course after telling her that she didn’t prescribe any nerve pain meds like gabapentin just an anti-viral med. I guess a bunch of ibuprofen will have to do. I feel guilty for even posting this because I know people are in way worse pain then me.

I think the message I was trying to get to is just tell someone. If you are in active addiction or a recovering addict just let someone know, it does wonders for your psyche. There is a higher chance they will be supportive then not. You can’t keep it bottled up forever.

I’ve never used. What am I doing on this subreddit? Well, my son was a user for nearly ten years, even though I only found out in 2017 after he barely survived an overdose. A couple years ago, a guy in long-time recovery gave him some suboxone & apparently the experiment succeeded. My son started using it, but without a prescription it was costing him as much as the opiates had. Finally in September 2020 he went, saw a doctor, got a prescription. That is also when he started being more open with me. He said that when he left the office with that prescription for suboxone in his hand, it was the first time in years that he thought maybe he had a future he could look forward to. After three years of my anxiety & his prevarication, you can imagine how happy that made me. It wasn’t easy though. A co-worker tested positive for Covid-19 and so my son, who had been seen talking to him for about one minute, got sent home for a 14-day quarantine. You know where this is going, right? Relapse, then massive fentanyl overdose. You can read about him in [this article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/05/fentanyl-opioid-crisis-overdoses-covid-pandemic).

Got about 2.5 hours of sleep last night. 
Headache is gone though...perhaps just a dull one that comes and goes. But those brain zaps are gone. 
But I'm definitely feeling the opiate withdrawals. 

I got meds and more supplements. Taking hot baths and getting outside (no choice in that matter lol gotta feed animals)

I'm definitely craving everything hard-core.  Tbh I almost slipped a minute ago with alcohol. But then I remembered how bad it makes the withdrawals and nope, can't do it. 
I also remembered that my pee is normal colored now and my face isn't as puffy!! My skin looks better. Not so dehydrated.

She just says she too drug naive so I’m just trying to pull one on her and disrespect her. Ive done all I could do to prove to her im not using.

From reading the title you can see what I’m trying to achieve here, just sobriety that lasts. I started using heavy back in November 2020, realized I had a dependency when I went a day without dosing and woke up in full blown withdrawals. I realize my dependency might be seen as a literal joke given i was taking 2 fent pressed m30’s a day but a dependency is a dependency. Around January i got to 11 days clean and relapsed, and i’ve been doing that same cycle ever since January, going a couple days clean, fighting through withdrawals then going right back to it like an absolute idiot. Last week I got to 4 days clean and threw it away, and 2 days ago i got to 3 days clean and ever since have gone through 7 m30’s and finished my stash, now i’m all empty. However, this time I want to make it last, make it stick. I dont want to go back after this withdrawal period, and any words of encouragement from you guys is greatly appreciated. I understand that this might not seem like a big thing at all to some of you that have gone through way worse than this, but for me this is my own version of the nightmare we all go through. I’m going to try my best to not relapse this time, as that is not an option I’m giving myself this time around, and I believe posting on here, finally after all this time is a great step in the right direction to really make this the last time I ever go through withdrawals again, and say goodbye to the shitty drug that holds us all back.

Got clean about 7 weeks ago but made the mistake of using this past Tuesday. I had moved away, but I'm kinda stuck at the moment. No job and actually today I get an update on a small cancer issue so I had a pity party n got fucked up. Honestly all it did was waste money, and gave me almost a wicked hang over. Nothing good came out of it. No withdrawal symptoms but mentally def messed my head up. So wasn't worth it. 
I was waiting for that ""ahhh moment"" where everything was ok for that short amount of time. It didn't happen. I got tired, headache and then my girl who has never used, I completely risked my relationship btw, questioned why I look like shit, didn't want dinner n basically passed out on the floor. 
Been through this before and I know that little devil will tell you anything but if anyone new to recovery just try not to. One overdose is very possible, two the mental toll is worse than any physical shit. I haven't had any cravings since which is nice and today woke up (still very early) and feel decent. Guess I'm waiting for that top of the world feeling but I lost the pink cloud on my first 700 tries to get clean lol. 
Again today I go back for my ultrasound, my GF doesn't want me to work or hit the gym (was a gym rat) until the doctor ok's it so walking is about the best I can do. I'm scared bc they found a tumor (I'm a guy so one guess where it is) but I let it go for well over a year bc I was using. My mom just passed away from cancer two weeks ago so time to take this seriously. 
I know it's a long post and most people here have been through the ringer, have had relapses, lost loved ones, had sicknesses but it's no reason to run back to a drug that just destroys everything. 
Hope everyone is doing well and has a good day.

Massive pupils, crying, sneezing, coughing, shitting, feeling sick, delirious, unable to sleep even with benzos and phenibut, heart racing, feeling exhausted and too weak to do even the most basic things. Time going so painfully slow. Honestly felt like there was no escape. I felt very suicidal on day 3 and was thinking of ending it, or going to the hospital one way or another to try and get opiates. Was even thinking of trying to rob a pharmacy, how fucked up is that.

The next few days things slowly got better, but still felt awful. I started doing basic things, I changed the bed sheets, did some washing, emptied the trash. Hot baths help a lot, and music.

I still feel bad today, aching, sweaty, no motivation to do anything. I am still going through withdrawals from taking low doses of OTC codeine throughout. But over the last few days I have started to feel moments of happiness when listening to music, watching stuff, or talking to people on here. I can eat food again without feeling sick, I think I've lost a lot of weight this week. I can walk without feeling like I'm gonna faint, weak with a racing heart.

I’ve been taking blues for the past 2-3 years but have been taking oxy for the past 3 and a half. The first part of my addiction wasn’t so bad, i wasn’t taking it every day and when I was taking it I would take 10-20mg, sometimes 30mg but not often at all.  Fast forward to now im taking 2 the minimum on a bad day, 3 1/2 to 4 on a good day, & 5-8 on a day i know i have a lot of cash on me which is about 2-3x per week. I haven’t been able to save the time money for this reason because I clearly use it all on my self to get blues. If i don’t take them I feel completely horrible and breakdown dreading every moment that passes by.. My body feels very weird, if I wait a whole day or 2 my back will begin to ache, my knees get this restless feeling where I feel like I have to keep massaging them or stretching them because I can’t get my body to relax(restlessness), stomach aches which lead to diarrhea and anxiety.  Im at the point where the blues aren’t enough and im the type of person who would ever think about taking dope, fentanyl or whatever hard opiates are out there.  Im at the point where im tired of being broke and wasting opportunities to make money or invest my money into things that are going to benefit me financially in the future.

I have surgery coming up in 7 days.

I have a week off of work before surgery, and was wondering if it would be worth while to detox, and go through withdrawals before surgery. I say ""worth it"" because I don't know if only being clean 7-8 days before surgery will matter in terms of impacting the withdrawals when I stop the painkillers I'll be taking after surgery, which will likely be about a week or so of usage (thankfully a family member will be handling dosing).

Am I just putting myself through unnecessary suffering because this short of a break won't really do anything, and the withdrawals I'll be dealing with now will be as bad as they would be after I stop taking anything after surgery? So basically a double whammy of withdrawals for not real point.

I wouldn't necessarily dose heavily this week, just take a little bit of kratom to keep the withdrawals at bay so I'm physically ok. Which in of itself would be a taper of sorts, so maybe that's a reasonable middle ground?

As a note, my pain management doctor and surgeon said ""it's up to me"" with what I want to do.

Everytime I was about to fall asleep at rehab my legs would have a spasm and wake me back up. After 5 years of taking Kratom I figured it was time to try to quit. I use to take 1.5 Tsp every 3 to 4 hours 4 to 5 times per day. 9 days ago I started taking only 1 Tsp every 3 to 4 hours 4 to 5 times per day, cutting my dose my 1/3.

It was very manageable as long as I was staying active. Other than being more sensitive to temperature that was the only thing I noticed. Now I have to decide on how long to let my body adjust to the 1Tsp per dose every 3 to 4 hours. Should I do it for another week or 2 to let my body completely adapt so I can have minimal symptoms on the next faze or should I just right into the next faze.

I've been abusing rx opiates (real stuff) since I was 15...got seriously addicted in 2011. Quit a bunch...relapsed a bunch. Did the kratom thing. Got hooked on that, then back to the pills. Terrible.

I've currently tapered down to Morphine 50 mg and oxycontin 40mg (some days 20 mg)   

I *was* at 100 mg morphine and probably 80 mg oxy a day for quite a while.  So, I went straight to halfing it. Ouch. 

I'm also an alcoholic and I'm on day 2 of CT. 
 
Needless to say, I'm feeling pretty terrible. 
My stomach is a wreck...I don't really have any comfort meds, just some supplements. The constant cramps are killing me. 

The sleep is horrible...that feeling like your heart is jumping through your chest. I can't stop getting weepy and crying. Ugggghhhhh

Below I list the main phases of my addiction (I appreciate this is not relevant to those medically prescribed the drug):

- Try oxy, think this is fucking amazing, like the most miraculous anti-depressant with no downside. I can take occasionally with days off in between. (Feel completely in control)

- Now I view Oxy as a tool to help me enjoy or get through challenging or big events. (Still feel completely in control)

- I begin to think I won’t enjoy social events or be able to get through difficult periods without a pill inside me (Still feel in complete control)

- The periods where I don’t take the pill start to feel worse, I just want to feel good all the time, what’s wrong with that? Right? (Still feel in control)

- Run out of pills due to a slow delivery or some other reason and start to feel really fucking bad, panic when I realise I now need a pill to feel ok (Panic at a sudden feeling I’ve lost control)

- Start buying more and more, spending money I can’t afford to ensure I don’t ever need to run out, take pills round the clock to avoid the bad feeling. (Realise I am completely out of control, that the drug is now in control and I am just trying to stay well)

The point of the above is to demonstrate the suddenness of the change from feeling completely in control, posting on r/opiates about how amazing oxy is, knowing I can stop any time but why should I? To the heavy slap of feeling those first signs of withdrawal that don’t go away in a couple of hours and the desperation to get a pill down my throat to make it go away, planning how to make sure I have an adequate supply with me when going on a trip becomes all consuming.

The reality is that from the very first pill and good feeling, the first point in the list above, the rest was inevitable. The descent is inevitable, because no matter what anyone would say to warn me I didn’t think it was a real threat to me (I’m far too in control) until that point when it’s too late to just stop.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9962142109870911}"

Generally just feeling down about the continued discomfort.

This morning I woke up to very little discomfort in my stomach and felt warm enough to drag myself out of bed relatively easily. I was actually hungry for breakfast for the first time in about 11 days. Stomach is a bit off now after eating but not feeling as uncomfortably cold.

I’m very wary of saying I feel good progress has been made because the improvements have been such slow, tiny incremental ones. I hope to God that this is a turning point.

I have a week or so vacation coming up and so I am hopeful I can enjoy it so much more than the trips away I had whilst worrying whether I had enough oxy hidden away in my luggage to get me through. I’ll be getting plenty of exercise and open country air, I really hope to be posting on here in a weeks time that I am coming home over this terrible experience.

After getting out of the hospital I was in a lot of pain still but had to work, a friend continued to supply me with the Oxy 30s from a family member who was prescribed, I would go through 5 30mg pills each week for roughly a month and a half. Near the end of the first month being out of the hospital, I knew my pain was no longer bothering me to the point where i needed to take them every day, so I tried to stop but due to withdrawals I relapsed after a week. It’s been about four months sense then and I’ve tried to do better, I take 15mg every day, sometimes I skip one day but end up feeling so low and get minor withdrawals so I never take a break longer than a day. Feeling quite stuck and controlled by these pills. I spend a lot of money on them because out of concern for my well being my friends family member stopped supplying me them. I’m not sure what to do at this point, I feel as if I cannot get up and go to work or live my daily life without taking these pills. I really need help just not sure where to start, am hoping someone here can help me with advice, I don’t know the effect it’s having on my body entirely but i’ve been having sharp chest pains the past couple of months and am too afraid to tell my parents i need to go to the doctor because they can’t find out i’m on these pills.

 Usually trying, always failing, to resist the calling of the sirens eerily haunting screams, to stay away from the demons that visit me in my dreams. To put it plainly, I’m usually trying, always failing to evade the darkness and just stay clean.

But my skin is still all salty from my last dip in this dark dark ocean, and my heart is thin from all the erosion that’s muddled up my concept of emotion. Seems as if something has been stolen from right out of my chest, though there was no bleeding, there was no mess. Somehow though, I became less and came to think the very best remedy was the searing caress of hot tar.  
I feel like an imploding star, somewhere between here and mars. Doesn’t science say that every star we see today is actually already dead, only an illusion of light, so you’re telling me if I have my facts right then we stare up at corpses, wish and chase after nothing at all.

2021-05-26 12:46:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/nlljmq/sick_days_pt2/,Sick days pt2," Well I pissed away 2 1/2 years of clean time. I love this place and I have gotten a lot of great responses from past posts so I guess I just wanted to come here and get some accountability, let everyone know that we can fall and get back up. I don't feel all that guilty as of yet, although I am sure that will come with time. Besides I am just not in a place where I can afford to worry about other people at this very moment, as selfish as that sounds it is the truth. I am proud of myself in some sense, for not washing totally down the drain as I have in the past. I am also thanking my lucky stars that I am a smoker and not a shooter, so relapses are a lot less dangerous from an OD standpoint, although fentanyl is everywhere now including the west coast where I live. 

   
 

Obviously the most important part of relapses is to catch it before it gets out of hand, I am a drug addict and I am always going to have a proclivity for drug abuse. Catching slips before we go down a slippery slope is of paramount importance, maybe even more important than preventing them in the first place. Statistics will support the fact that we are more likely to relapse than get sober and stay that way the rest of our lives, in a perfect world we wouldn't need communities like this but the world isn't perfect and I am most definitely not either. Although I haven't been able to string together a massive amount of clean time, it has been on an upward trajectory and I am still proud of the 2 1/2 years. I pissed away the 2 1/2 years but that doesn't mean I need to fuck up my whole life. If I can use this to push me forward to get 5 years of clean time minus 3 weeks then it is probably still a net positive. I also don't need to exacerbate an already negative situation with really negative thoughts at the moment, I am doing what I need to do to get back on track and then I can deal with the pain and suffering this has caused. 

   
 

Now I will get in to a bit of what happened so that hopefully if you are reading this you won't be as cavalier with your clean time as I have been. I have been buying adderall for someone close to me, who cannot get an ADHD diagnosis with their current healthcare provider. This has been going on for a few years, with no issues. Suddenly though a friend steered me in the direction of a new dealer whose prices were half of what my original guy's were, so I started going to him. I should have seen the signs and said fuck this it is too dangerous, because the new guy is an absolute bartard, and that is a very dangerous drug for me personally. Xanax is a bit weird in that I have had some benzo issues, never long-term addiction but definitely short term, although it is much more of a crash and burn drug than opioids are. I used to be able to do opioids for a while and conceal it for a remarkable amount of time. For me Xanax/benzos lead to absolute catastrophes in such a quick manner that usually I don't have enough time to develop a bad addiction anyways, but it hasn't quite gotten through my thick head that I absolutely cannot do it under any circumstances the way opioids had been for a while. I guess for all the damage that xanax has caused, it has been more recent, and opioids have been draining me on and off for 10 years. 

&#x200B;

So anyways, after buying from him a few times, dealing with the stupid bullshit of waiting outside his apartments for 20-30 mins or more, him forgetting shit and just being an idiot in general I ended up buying a couple bars. I was having surgery and I knew that the person that was going to be holding my opioids was going to be really stingy with them, and I didn't want to be in pain. That is exactly the poor type of rationalization that should have been an easily recognizable red flag and has led me into trouble in the past. I never had to deal with that kind of stupid dealer shit with my old addy guy, and I should have just seen the red flags but I didn't. Something about dealing with waiting in parking lots to buy drugs triggered me a little bit as stupid as that sounds. The worst part is that I was taking the xanax with my Norco (every 4-6 hours, as prescribed :) lol) for a few days and then I ran out of the bars and I wanted to stop the opioids so I’m pretty sure I didn’t even finish the bottle. It all went really well actually, ***too*** well. I didn't get any more for a few weeks until I needed to get more of the addys, and then a couple weeks further down the road he informed me that he had real OC 30's. Being a smoker, and having fallen down the rabbit hole of the OG 80's, this was kind of a big deal. The fact that I had been using Xanax and Norco with relative success did not help matters either. I only bought two, planned on leaving it at that, and we all know where that goes. By the way they actually were real oxys, I know because I took a drug test. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward a couple weeks, not of consecutive use, but of increasing amounts (buying up to 5 at at time so I wouldn't have to put up with his dealer bullshit) and here I am experiencing minor withdrawals for the first time in a few years. And although they are minor, they are pretty fucking debilitating. Things like making the bed feel monumental, my body cannot control temperatures, I am twitchy, jumpy, uncomfortable in any position, muscle aches, diarrhea, stomach issues, the whole deal really. Probably one of the worst parts of withdrawal is just the dread and anxiety of waiting for symptoms to appear, the first few days knowing that it will definitely get worse, and knowing that my body and brain are going haywire because I lost control again. The situational irony of having just posted a month ago here about remembering the old days when I was laid up in bed sick during beautiful spring days is not lost on me. Falling back into this hole seemed so far away then. 

&#x200B;

Part of the problem of having used heroin extensively in the past, is that I have sort of achieved the pinnacle of the drug universe, the top of the pyramid if you will. I have a tendency to look at other drugs as lesser than or not as dangerous, and although that may be the case, it still is a really slippery slope. I was rationalizing the drug use in my head, just a couple bars here and there, then the oxys were not even half the milligrams of the original 80s that I started using 10 years ago so they can't be **THAT** bad. Besides, I handled the Norco/xanax really well and I've been clean for a while! I am probably forgetting a few more rationalizations but I am sure you have all experienced this avalanache yourselves and understand how in control it feels in the moment. It is really scary that I know that what I am doing is dangerous, but somehow I convince myself that everything is OK, and I fall into the exact same traps that have led me into drug induced madness in the past. This is exactly the same thing I have done so many times, it starts off with just a couple little slips here and there, and then before I know it I am right back where I used to be. 

I don’t want to include much about the loved ones that have been affected by this because you guys know how that goes already and I really am trying to avoid that type of thinking right now. I will deal with that when I am ready, I have a lot of support, and a lot of people that are here as a safety net to help me when I do fall. It is sad to watch how much this affects them, I cannot think of another condition that creates so much unintentional damage to other people. I am extremely lucky to have the support, I've been lucky to have support throughout my entire using career. Although at certain points I had isolated so much, I couldn't afford to let those that were still around down again, and so I didn't really have anyone left to turn to. It was easier from a guilt perspective in some ways then, because I was mostly hurting myself, but there are always casualties, and doing it alone is really really tough.

Sometimes the circumstances of our lives overwhelm us, I did not include the massive amount of stress I have been under, a lot of it not of my own creation either. But I did create the conditions that allowed this to get as out of hand as it did, and for that I take complete responsibility. I am really lucky that I am able to take this time off of work, get away from the mess I created, clear my head for a few days and come back stronger and better. I am on day 2, which is a little better than day 1, and hopefully I am back to my normal self here soon.

Working in the same rehabilitation center I got sober in helped me stay grounded. It helped me stay focused on my recovery. It was nice, for about a year. Until there were layoffs, supposedly from covid. I was one of the lucky winners. Me and another guy that went through the program. He had been hired for the same position, maintenance. Fresh outta rehab. They shipped him to the other side of Florida to work at the Pinellas facility. He went back home after the layoffs. He made it about two weeks before he overdosed. He died January 20th 2021. 

   You see nine times out of ten, the people that come to treatment have lost everything. Rock bottom as they say. Generally, it takes a real calamity to motivate an addict to seek help. Their lives have crumbled. Their world is upside down. So, most of the time clients in recovery are completely starting over; rebuilding from the rubble. Desperation, denial, pain, suffering, loss, hopelessness. An overwhelming sense of loneliness. All of these things drop on their head like an anvil when they sober up and they have no choice but to confront them. They have no choice but to confront themselves. 

  True introspection is a foundation of recovery. Addicts in recovery have to look inside and try to conceptualize what they are looking at. It is hard, it is uncomfortable and usually quite painful. Most people are terrified of themselves, whether they know it or not. That self-ridicule begins. That shame. That guilt.

  “Look at you. Look what you’ve done. You have ruined everything. You have no purpose; you have no place; you are nothing but a burden.” 

  Being an addict going into rehab, I felt as if I have been thrown away by society, or by my family; and I knew it was all my fault. The vision of my future went blank. My perception of the present was just a kaleidoscope of raw devastation and unregulated emotion.  Getting sober, drying out, detoxing. It’s grueling. It's painful. It’s physiological torture. But you would be surprised what you can do when you have no choice; when you are cornered and out of options.

  But what happens when you are back upright and you learn how to play that shit hand life dealt you? When you are doing everything right; staying clean, going to work every day, exercising, getting closer to your goals. When you start to feel what it's like, to actually be proud of yourself. What happens when you do everything by the book and still, life decides to blindside you with another fucking catastrophe?

  As an addict, maintaining sobriety during a crisis can feel like swallowing a live grenade. You want to explode engulfing everything around you. There is no hiding from the threat. No running. Because it is you. Your mind. It’s your thoughts, beliefs and emotions. An intricate spiderweb of cognition and you are tangled in it. If you don’t somehow untangle yourself quick enough, that ominous spider that is your addiction, will eat you alive and you will let it.

Quick backstory: I'm in my 30s and will have a whole year alcohol free in just over a week. I had occasional prior experience with opiates, but things have really escalated to a point now where I'm using daily to feel normal. The only problem is, it's not normal. Normal me is happy, healthy and productive. I feel the complete opposite right now.

It started just before Christmas when I met a dealer. I got a few oxys every other weekend, then every weekend, then during the week and so on. I've taken a few days to up to a week off a few times since then.

I've been taking 20-30mg of oxyneo per day (chewing) and a few lines of hydromorphone here and there for a kick. This has been going on for almost 2 months straight. I feel like shit every morning, I'm sniffling and anxious until I take my first 10mg around noon. An hour later, I feel good, but brain-dead. I'm acutely aware of this due to the projects piling up.

I'm ready and willing, but terrified of withdrawal. I have a few 40's left. I was thinking of doing a quick taper for a few days then CT. I'm not sure if I'll have the discipline, and also not sure if I even need to taper. One way or another though...I'm getting this monkey off my back for good.

2021-05-25 06:17:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/nkmb5x/time_to_quit/,Time to quit,"So, I’ve been using opiates on and off for around 4 years. Mainly lean/codeine, morphine and oxy.

For a long period of time I felt I was in control of my usage, but this year things have got pretty bad, to the point of dependency.

Currently I’m taking ~80mg of oxy per day, most of the time it doesn’t even get me that high, you know, I’m not nodding out hard - it just keeps me feeling good and functional. But I’ve now got to the point where I know this isn’t sustainable.

I’ve quit several times before, last year I managed about 2 months completely clean and was in a much better place. But alas, relapse has led to more frequent usage and subsequently dependency.

My question is this. At the moment have 12x 80mg oxys left, and a few morphine pills and a small amount of liquid morphine. What is the best way to approach this, do I:

a) go cold turkey from the off, and just deal with the acute withdrawals that will follow; or 

b) do a mini taper with the remaining opiates I have left. Something like a few days on 80mg, then reduce to 60mg, the 40mg, 20mg and so on. So when I make the jump it’s from a lower dose. With the bits that I have, I could probably get down to 10mg of morphine per day for a few days before going cold turkey

The caveat with a) is that if I’ve got oxys in the house, I know it’s going to be incredibly difficult to not use them when going through the acute WD stage. Yes, in an ideal world I would chuck them away etc. But we all know this is easier said than done! 

I’m just not sure whether continuing using  with a mini taper for a couple of weeks is just going to make me more dependant and hinder me further; or whether it will make the WDs less intense when I stop.

As I say, I’m familiar with what withdrawal entails, and the little tricks and tips that help you alleviate the severe symptoms (staying hydrated, hot showers, imodium, paracetamol, benzos etc.). So whatever option I decide take I know what I’m up against and what I need to do. This isn’t my first rodeo, as they say!

I just want to know if a mini taper is going to benefit me. 

I’m pretty ashamed that I’ve let it get to this point but I’m a pragmatic guy and I know I need to sort myself out. I live with my gf and although she knows I’ve battled with addiction for a long time, she has no idea of the current situation I’m in. Telling her would break her heart, so that is not an option.

2021-05-25 01:48:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/nkidsl/day_7_update/,Day 7 Update,"
My dear god, I can’t quite believe it’s only been 7 days. It feels like weeks since I last took oxy, weeks of feeling like shit. But, it’s day 7 and I feel like charting the progress, for my own sake and in the hope it helps anyone else.

1.5 to 2 year oxy habit (60mg per day - maybe a bit more on special occasions), 2nd attempt at quitting, first failed to really even start due to a combination of weak will and bad luck (obviously more the former). This time I did a rapid taper that I am not including in the day count and then ct.

My rapid taper was a single, last pill that I split in half and consumed over 2 days, it was a small amount but I think it only delayed my pain.

I work Monday to Friday and couldn’t take time off, I spend most of my days in video meetings so need to be functional. My only comfort meds are some Valium (I know the risks, if I thought I could function at work on no sleep, or taken time off, then I would have tried without).

Sunday - dosed as normal until early evening then stopped, or more accurately arrived at my last pill.

Monday - Felt like shit, all the usual wd symptoms, took half a pill at midday and felt a bit better until the evening. 10mg Valium in the evening didn’t help me sleep so took another 10mg and slept.

Tuesday - Exactly the same as Monday. Hence my feeling the rapid taper idea was a bad one.

Day 1 - First day with no oxy. Shivering, sweating mess. Stomach discomfort, no diarrhoea for me (spoiler - I don’t shit till day 5). I feel achingly cold most of the time but also sweaty. As soon as each work meeting finishes I respond to a few emails then strip off and dive into bed, on which I’ve added a heated blanket, and lie there until I start sweating (about 5 minutes...).

Day 2 - Much like day 1.

Day 3 - The random sweats seem to reduce in the evening. All other symptoms stay pretty much the same. I feel freezing pretty much all the time. Stomach is feeling twisted, I force down morsels of food but I have had no appetite since Monday.

Day 4 - Weekend! Time to go shopping, spend half the time leaning on my trolley with my head on the handle, sweating and wishing my stomach would fuck off. Get lots of strange looks, “bit of a stomach bug” I say, rubbing my belly and trying to look normal. Took a bunch of constipation meds - I feel like I really need to shit. Drop my Valium dose to 10mg, a regretful decision.

Day 5 - Sleep, my old trusty friend, I love sleep. 1 fucking hour of it. The rest of the time I’m lying in bed twisting and turning with my roiling gut and shivering limbs. 5am and a miracle occurs, the god of bowel movements takes note of my dire state and brings forth redemption, in the form of a disappointingly unimpressive bout of mild diarrhoea. I go back to bed feeling cheated, stomach still feels bad. Spend the day feeling like I am going insane, I really love sleep but whenever I close my eyes my mind is filled with random shit. The last two days have been the most difficult emotionally; a lot of sadness, occasional hopelessness, why have I wasted the best part of 2 years? How could I have neglected my loved ones for so long? What if one of them dies just as I stop the drug, and I’ve missed all this time? Soul hurts. Stick to 10mg of Valium and finally sleep takes me, repeatedly and briefly before letting me go again, fucking sleep.

Day 6 - Back to work. I’m still freezing cold most of the time, stomach still rough and still no appetite. However. All of these symptoms have eased, slowly and almost imperceptibly over the last 2 days. It’s still a tough day to get through, but I make it. Come the evening I start to feel hungry, actual hunger, for food, an uplifting moment. I cook a decent meal, my first in a week and eat all of it. Stomach still feels a bit off. I go to bed and for the first time take my t-shirt off when I get in - I don’t feel freezing, another uplifting feeling. I go to sleep feeling generally uplifted but I still took 7.5mg of Valium.

Day 7 - (Today) Feel significantly better this morning. Slept relatively normally. Discomfort levels are way down, mild stomach discomfort and a bit colder than I would normally feel. Have a combination of emotions, not wanting to work and yet feeling proud to have come so far, a bit of elation when I think about how bad I was feeling just a couple of days ago. I also know I need to stop the Valium, I have about 10 pills left and no way to get more easily, just dreading more sleepless nights.

To end this overly long novel of a post I just want to say that my over-riding emotion is a yearning to be free, free from the pills and free from their horrific effect on my body. Fuck those sinister little bastards, I know some people are stuck, needing to use them for actual physical pain and to you I can only offer my heartfelt wish that you can find a place of balance from which you can enjoy life with as little pain as possible.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988853335380554}"

Sounds great !,"So we are trying day 1 again as I have just finished taking my last endones and I realised something scary... I don’t think I want to stop. I enjoy how I feel on oxy so much. The ritual, watching things online to help me get into my fantasy world going at night on the balcony with my coffee and smokes and music and creating a world for hours. I want to just be in my room with unlimited amount of money and oxy and stop living all together and just be high constantly. But here’s the thing, I remember a quote someone posted from rehab stating ‘play the tape all the way through’
I know this dream is unrealistic, there’s no such thing as a causal oxy user and I’m sure if I keep going it will slowly but surly ruin my life but a part of me doesn’t care because of how happy I am when high. However, I think this is just because I am so serverly lonley and depressed that I haven’t had anything good happen in my life that I’m viewing this as the only good thing in my life. I know that there are things in  real life that feel so much better than any drug high and the longer I keep taking oxy and am stuck in this rut the longer it will actually take me to get to a place where I can experience those things. And I know they exsist because there was a time where I never needed drugs or anything to be happy. For some context my life came to a screeching halt 4 years ago when I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I fought like hell for two and a half years in intensive therapy to re wire my brain and overcome it and anxiety. I am mentally a completely different person from bpd me but coming out of therapy felt like coming out of a prison. Everyone had moved on in life and I was at a standstill for two and a half years. It was an incredibly lonley feeling than after a year of getting my life started again COVID happened and isolation for 9 month destroyed me and started my oxy habit. I think I am dreading having to go through the struggle of slowly having to rebuild AGAIN to get back to a place where the life I have is better than a life on drugs. Maybe because I have fought for so long already. But I know the longer I put it off the harder it will be. I’m just so exshausted and being on the drugs is like a relief and I really wish I didn’t feel this way about it. I wish I felt ashamed and disgusted by my actions. I don’t want to have to reach rock bottom to finally have some sense knocked into me. Gods I have worked so hard on my mental health for what seems like such little pay off at the moment. Please don’t mistake this rant for self pity I am just trying to be honest and put how I feel into words. Maybe in hopes I’ll make some sense of it. Or someones reply will give me some understanding. Right now I’m starting day one of being off oxy after a month relapse from being clean for 4 month of a 9 month habit. But it feels like I’m getting clean cuz it’s the right thing to do rather than cuz I want to stop doing it. And it both concerns and bothers me that I feel this way.

Gym was my biggest helper in the WD and I really made it for 4 months. I also even had weeks where I did not even thought about opiates anymore. I was too busy thinking about my new girlfriend and training my body.

Lockdown came and I slowy came back to my old habbits. I started chipping first and then came back to daily usage.

Thanks to lyrica I was able to handle the pain. Without it I guess it would be almost impossible for me. Lyrica kills 80% of the pain for me but im still knocked out very baldy.

Has someone made experience with tapering down and using lyrica at the same time? Would it be possible to cut the pain almost to zero? If I go very slowly down with the tolerance and use lyrica to handle the small pain due the tapering?

My backstory is pretty linear, I was an IV heroin user for 8 years. Blew out all my veins, destroyed my body, stole, lied, cheated etc. just the quintessential “Requiem” dope fiend. I spent the last two years and 10 months on Suboxone. I ended up being able to do a complete 180 with my life. I’m now engaged, bought my first house, make pretty good money, and more importantly had my son. I set my vacation time at the beginning of the year and planned to jump from Subs then. I was able to taper down to 1.5mg from starting at 24mg in detox/rehab. I had trouble stabilizing lower, so I just went for it. Days 1-3 weren’t bad, and days 4-10 I used Low dose Kratom and it helped a ton, but I was having anxiety attacks about getting addicted to something else. Days 10-14 I started using 300mg of gabapentin before bed which helped my sleep a ton. So far my worst physical symptoms have been RLS/insomnia, lethargy and extreme back pain. But as of the past couple days I’ve been having some really bad ups and downs mentally (which is unusual for me, I like to consider myself pretty stoic”.

Rehab - clean for a few months then relapse x4times. 
Now ive been on for about a little month without a break on benzos and opiates, going to my doc. Tomorrow but very anxious about they cant help me out there, since some very bad experiences with my doc when reaching out for help. 
Rehab again is not a possibility for now. 
My question is, should i just CT after this month binge on opi+benzos or what to do if the doc. Really cant help me out with any detox medication.

3 year habit of daily codeine use, about 300g codeine a day spaced between 2-3 doses. Also a 1 year habit of oxycodone about 70g a day, more on days when I had more access to it. The oxycodone wasn’t actually every day, but only 1 or two days off a week. I do have some baclofen 25mg, about 20 tablets left. I have magnesium and vitamin c (lol). I have weed but it makes me really anxious, although sometimes I’ve tried to use it to use less opiates. At this stage I won’t be seeing a doctor in an attempt for help, I live in a very small town and am not ok with telling my doctor about this as she is close with way too many people that I know (I know about doctor/patient confidentiality, but it still makes me uncomfortable). I have about 50 tablets of 30mg codeine left, I have tried to taper with them and it just never works because with me, it’s all or nothing. No oxycodone left and no more access to it. Any suggestions appreciated.

Also, I know this doesn’t seem like a crazy high amount of opiates, but when it’s done for 3 years straight, the withdrawals are real. I’m not worried about physical withdrawals, I can handle that pretty well. It’s the mental aspect, the dysphoria, anxiety, depression, unease and irritation that kills me.

I would take these pills because for once i actually felt happy and could do anything i wanted. Im not a huge gamer but with these pills it’s the only thing i enjoy doing and can actually sit there for hours (which i know isn’t healthy).

recently i started taking oxy 10mg and would take about 3 to get the proper nod and wow i’ve never felt better in my life. All i’d need is those 3 for the day and i would be set and happy as ever knowing there was more waiting for me tomorrow. it’s like i would gain happiness knowing that i would be happier tomorrow (if that makes any sense)

I’m also on 20mg lexapro and that shit makes me sleep 12+ hours a day and honestly i like it. I would rather sleep than be awake at this point. 

Anyway, starting tonight will be my first 24 hours without any oxy and will be without forever. it sucks knowing i won’t be able to enjoy anything and the withdrawals are going to suck. Also i hate glorifying it so much but it really is something else. It wasn’t my choice to come off of it. 

I guess i just need more help and i’ve been a lurker on here for ages knowing i’m fucking my life up. But why would i ever stop it it’s giving me so much happiness? I know i’m not in to deep and it can get far more worse but i’m honestly at the stage where i don’t care about anything anymore. Few years ago i was so scared about the thought of death alone. Now i couldn’t care less.

I have been off a 24 yr 155mg methadone dependency for 29 days. I tapered for years. I ended up in psychosis at 65mgs (taper too fast) Hospitalized n poly drugged. My meth taper was rudely interrupted to allow 1yr of psych meds. 6 different anti-everything they had later...  n I was withdrawing from lithium etc. The last of those meds was klonopin. Way too big a cut from 1mg put me in 6month withdrawal, even though I eventually resumed original dose. So, I still have that dependency waiting to be concurred. 

I look back over last 5yrs n see that I probably kindled my brain. The Residents in power at Psychward didn't recognize my state to be from withdrawal. They told me wk 1 that I was a schizophrenic, bi-polar wk 2. They claimed methadone was suppressing my disease, and withdrawal can't give u psychosis. Bullshit!! A layman n google can see that's a lie. Anyway...

Now, I'm supposed to be over the rainbow. Sadly, I'm in a place rainbows don't seem to exist. Even with tapering to 1mg from meth, it feels like a cold Turkey in my brain n body. After 12mg I stayed in withdrawal. Before that I would stabilize between drops. So I have been in withdrawal for months. But after 0....  Volume turned way up. So bad, I have turned to Kratom. Against every fiber in my being I take it, to save my mental n physical health. And yet....

Here I am day 29 and I feel fucked! Worse than days 1-7. Brain is twisted. I can feel my brain literally. It's like being forced to wear bifocals when u dont need them. How blurry would that be? How bad would ur head get? Even a simple thought gives me panicky brainfog. And the physical... Electric shock therapy must be like this. I took a month off n it's not even close to over. How can I work?!? I can't. The kratom brings much needed short term relief. Probably more than I realize, but damn!

Every battle I won. Every night n day I stayed in the game hurt. It could not have all been to lose. Right? This post is so long. If anyone can chime in, please do. Unless, it's a horror story with no rainbow. I have an abundance of that already. Lol. Love n light needed 🙏",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992043375968933}"

Quitting cold turkey as of tomorrow.,"So as the title says, I relapsed approximately a month ago after learning that my father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. My dealer gave me a 'pitty bag' today after I broke down. I've been chipping away at that today, smoking the odd line to keep the sweats away. I'm going to keep enough for a line or two in the morning because I might be able to get to visit him in the hospital and I don't want to do that in withdrawals, but that'll be my last smoke.   


I'm just making this thread so I can track my progress as well as vent on the bad days. Hopefully, I might be able to get some support from the great community here in r/OpiatesRecovery too, as I'm currently living at home with my mother and brother and they can't find out so I can't confide in them.  


Just for context, I was smoking a €20 bag a day almost every day over the last month. Before the relapse, I had almost a month of clean time.   


Luckily I've managed to get some valium from the pharmacy which should definitely help, and I have some Immodium here for my bowels.   


This is going to be the worst withdrawal ever because the inevitable depression is going to be compounded by the fact that my father is likely not going to recover from this.  
I need to be strong for my mother and younger brother as well as my father now so this has to be nipped in the bud right now.   


Its extremely trying to think clearly right now so for the moment I'll leave it at that. Thank you so much to everyone who has read this and any words of support would be greatly appreciated. I'll expand more upon whats going on in my head tomorrow.   


The worst thing about all of this? I cant get down to visit him because of Covid restrictions. I've seen him 3 times since he was admitted but he was recently moved into a new ward where visitors arent allowed. I have to make an appointment if I want to see him and the likelihood of me being allowed is very slim.   
I'll be sure to check in daily and provide a timeline of symptoms as they rise and fall - though I know I'm in for at least 10 days of misery before the symptoms begin to ease.

I had a 10+ year heavy IV heroin and cocaine habit. I was pretty much speedballing round the clock by the last year. And I would get oxy 80s off and on during that time too - that was when you could find the real OCs. I also had a 5 year attempt/run on methadone in there, which I abused and I was prescribed 2 benzos which I did not abuse.

I cleaned up because I was backed into a corner that I couldn’t get out of with every aspect of my life- financially, spiritually, socially and career-wise.

I did a way-too-fast methadone taper to give myself a softer landing. But my WDs lasted for months because I was coming off so many things. I got off heroin, coke, methadone, Xanax and klonopin. I still can’t believe I survived that.

Since I’ve been clean my life has changed is so many positive ways, and to a large extent I’ve been able to start becoming the person I always hoped I could be.  I have achieved things I can’t believe were even possible for me. And I’m old! You young ones getting clean: the world is yours, believe it.

Quick story: I had to get clean in the same neighborhood I used to score in - which has been a challenge. Today I was walking the dog, and up drives one of my main old plugs (who I hadn’t seen in forever), and he hollers at me out the window. He yelled “hey MetaMeta it’s been 3 years right?” And I was like “nope 4”. 

I swear he didn’t know my clean date. And of course it was implied that if I was not clean there was opportunity. But when I said “4” he waved and drove off lol. I feel like that was some kind of sign from the universe but I’m not sure what it meant. Kind of blew my mind. I guess I’ll take that as “hey, this is your monkey... just letting you know I’m here when you want me...” You can’t ever let your guard down.

Everyday I realize more and more things that never made sense when I was high. I have an app that tracks my sober days and finances. During my addiction, I had a very very very high paying “job” ;). Making 500-1000$ a day I felt unstoppable and good. What I didn’t realize is how much I would spend to get high. I used an app to track my spending habits on drugs and found this statistic that made me sick to my stomach but now I’m using it as motivation to keep pushing. 


In 2020, this dumbass (me) spent on average $170 a day getting high. That means every month I was spending $5170 just to get high....THATS $61,000 A YEAR TO FEED MY ADDICTION. That number is not even counting the days I’d “party” and take 4 Oxy 30’s, 6 Xanax bars, AND 1-2Oz Promethazine Codeine (STUPID EXPENSIVE)...Most people I know don’t even make $61,000 in a year working a solid job and I spent that much just to be high for a year?...I literally blew through a down payment for a house in 1 year of using. Reading that makes me sick to my stomach but what’s gone is gone already so I told myself I need to move on there’s no reversing my decisions. Now those numbers haunt me and keep me from going back. I plan to use all the money I would have spent this year getting high on a Corvette c7. Nothings going to feel better than riding in that new corvette knowing I earned a new car just for staying sober... after all it’s easier to justify a new race car for $50,000 instead of a lot of pills. 

Hope this post can help those recovering to see how much better they’d be off financial and physically/ mentally of course just by kicking a bad habit. 22 days strong and I’ve saved $3,570 on average so far. Life is good (:",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978362917900085}"

It’s day 4 since ct from oxy (1.5 years-ish maybe half that was regular, multi-doses per day doses up to 60mg per day), my stomach has been sickly, painful, just horrible throughout and no significant diarrhoea, maybe a bit day 1. I’ve been trying to eat something each day but I’m barely crapping at all, almost nothing for 3 days. But feel this constant, horrible pressure in my gut. 

I thought stopping opioids left you with the opposite problem. Anyone else had the same issue? Or maybe it’s all in my head and the stomach pain is just the wd and I’m barely shitting because I’m not eating enough.

*update* For anyone interested in my toilet habits! I forced down 3 sachets of some godawful powder throughout yesterday evening, it said it was for relieving constipation and 6 sachets would deal compacted bowel. Anyway, I slept for about 1 hour last night but after many false starts I eventually succeeded in the early hours.

I am new to this forum this is my first post a little bit about my story I’m 26 years old and I am a fentanyl and Xanax Addict. I have been using opioids daily for 2 1/2 years. I went to treatment at the end of March and long story but was essentially kicked out three days before completing the program Because of an altercation that I got into with a staff member. When I got kicked out my mom and family basically abandoned me and disowned me. It’s been a month since I have returned from treatment and I’ve used every day since. My mom would not let me come home after I was kicked out was basically left to fend for myself mind you I have a brother 16 months younger than me who was in treatment at the exact same time for the exact same thing and my mom is Currently finding an entire apartment of his own and his whole life food groceries etc. so I’ve had to spend my entire bank account on hotels to put a roof over my head. It sucks because I truly was in a really good place towards the end of treatment and I planned and wanted so desperately to live a true sober life. I thought once I got out of treatment I would make my mom proud for the first time in my life. But it was simply the opposite and it broke my heart. So crying as I type this it’s caused me to spiral and use again since the minute I stepped off the plane back home. I am almost out of money I have about two days left in a hotel and then I don’t know what my next move will be.

I just want to die so badly, it would take all the pain and misery away, if I could I would but my body has never even put me close to an overdose so I know it’s not possible for me I can’t even get high only well and haven’t gotten high for a year and a half regardless of how many pills I do.
I’m so depressed and trying so hard to keep myself from doing something stupid but it is so hard when I feel so alone and so uncared-for and neglected especially with what my moms doing for my brother vs what she does to me. 
Any support or stories you guys have I’d love to hear. Struggling or succeeding.


I do have one big question though that I’ve been researching some that I don’t seem to understand. Suboxone’s always worked very well for me, but waiting the 24 hour period to take it is what holds me back from escaping this life. It sounds so stupid, shouldn’t I be able to do ANYTHING for 24 hours? I wish it was that simple. With that said, my main question is is the Burnece method a method where you take Suboxone while using? How does that not throw you into precipitated withdrawal? And how does it exactly work? Has anybody had Success with this method? I know it’s probably so much easier and so much less of a hassle to just power through those 24 hours but I know if there truly was a way to take subs and get off the shit without having to go through the horrid day off with drawls i’d give it a fighting chance.

Thanks so much for anybody who’s taking the time to even read my post. Much love and blessings to all, keep fighting, being an addict isn’t easy. Always making sure you somehow have money for your drugs, always making sure you have them, always making sure the dealer is good so you don’t run out, rationing and always making sure you’re in a place where you can use for example my friends went to go float the river one day but I couldn’t go because it’s a seven hour float and I couldn’t be snorting pills on a raft. We give up so much as attics and work so hard to make sure we always have what we need if you have that tenacity for drugs you sure as hell can have it in another aspect of your life. I always think to myself wow, if I were to put in the money, effort, and energy not to mention the relationships and everything else you give up into something else in my life I would destroy any obstacle ahead and I believe that holds true for any addict.

The circumstances are rather mysterious, and there are a lot of suspicious actions & statements from several people. I want to be specific here, so my question is about heroin use in particular.

She had gotten into heroin and other drugs since coming to Seattle to join the band Hole. Apparently there was a lot of peer pressure. She found the environment toxic in other, figurative ways as well. She decided to take a vacation of sorts by rejoining her old band from Minnesota, Janitor Joe, and going on a tour with them. She came back to Seattle clean and happy, and wanting to stay that way.

She was in the process of moving back to Minnesota, and returned to Seattle to collect the rest of her stuff. On the final night, a friend/traveling companion slept in the U-Haul in the parking lot to prevent theft, while Kristen slept in the apartment she was vacating. She was within hours of being free. Apparently one or more people (probably certain people she knew) visited her that night, and she was found dead in the bathtub the next morning, with drug paraphernalia nearby. Her death was said to be an accidental heroin overdose. (I'm not going to go into some suspicious things about that declaration.)

Even I know that relapses are insidious, and that people in that circumstance can misjudge their dose. I just find it hard to believe that she (clean for months) would request ""one more for the road,"" when the biggest reason for her to get on the road within hours was to stay clean. If a ""friend"" (or more than one) brought heroin to her unsolicited, would her addiction return then, & lead her to accept the ""gift,"" rather than declining and/or asking them to leave? If they had left heroin there with her, would the temptation to take a dose (rather than throw it away) return with a vengeance? Either way, what a *disgusting* thing for these ""friends"" to do!

**Tl;dr** (best that I can do; reading the whole post is a good idea)- Would someone who's been clean for months, wants to stay that way, and is within hours of driving far away from their heroin-ravaged environment, be tempted to take ""one more for the road,"" either by requesting it, or by accepting (& using) if it was brought unsolicited?  (How's that for a run-on sentence?)

2021-05-21 01:35:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/nhl1kc/recovery/,Recovery,"Hey guys. I haven’t been on Reddit in around a year or so now, honestly it didn’t even cross my mind until now. This is my first post back into this group, and I know it’s long so I don’t expect all of you to read its entirety. I just appreciate having a place to express myself and feel I’m not alone. I relapsed several times while trying to get clean from Benzos, Opioids and Alcohol, I was physically addicted to all three (although I could get by with one or the other of Alcohol or Benzos, naturally). I tried and tried, and in the process my wife left me (unrelated reasons, but addiction played its part), and I just lost myself. I ramped up dosages on everything over the course of the next 2 or 3 months, lost my job, got a DUI and went to jail, lost my truck, my apartment, friends, family, and like I said my wife and youngest son. When I got out of jail after the weekend, I went home and gave up. I regressed very quickly and ended up in a dark place and didn’t want to live or at the very least be conscious. So I dosed and dosed and drank and drank all day every day, and every day I lied on my couch just using and crying, bawling even, and begging to just not exist anymore. I was absolutely at my worst rock bottom that I had ever hit, and I thought I had hit it several times before. I’m not sure exactly what happened inside me or inside my mind whether subconsciously or at some level consciously, but one day I told myself out of nowhere that I was going to try again. I called my aunt in Utah and my mom, both of whom had dropped little hints here and there trying not to push me but letting me know treatment is an option at the same time hoping I would change my mind. My aunt set everything up and I got absolutely blitzed out of my mind because I felt like I was giving up in a way, maybe because I couldn’t do it on my own. So two days later, my dad was picking me up from my apartment to take me down to Ogden Regional to their ACT (Alcohol and Chemical Treatment) facility, and for the first time in my life I checked into inpatient treatment in a state where I was alone with no chance of just leaving and walking home, no friends to pick me up, no family to pressure if it came to that, and these were the reasons I chose to go where I did. Something changed in me and I decided I didn’t want to die. At the point that I texted my aunt to set it up, I was puking at least three times a day, usually somewhere around 5 or 6, my body just was rejecting anything and everything and it was shutting down. I hadn’t eaten for 5 days, hadn’t drank more than a smart water bottle over the course of 3 days, hadn’t slept more than maybe 2 hours a night, hadn’t showered or left the apartment in over a week and was isolating from my wife who at the time was gone and family. My body was just rejecting anything I put into it, including drugs and alcohol. I could not keep it down and as a result I became more violently ill. I was a hollow body that just existed as a shell of a being. I had nothing to live for I felt, and no reason to stop using or killing myself. I don’t know what internal epiphany or resolve happened, but I followed through and rode with my dad to detox. I was in the detox unit for 3 days, during which period I still had a part of myself convinced that I was just going to do the 3 days detox and then come back home and do outpatient on my own. I had the most caring and compassionate counselor during my time period in detox. He checked on me constantly, gently probing me to learn more about me, and at the end of the 3 days he seemed like he knew me personally. He read me right off the bat and I trust him, so when he guided me to stay in inpatient there over the 3 days, on my last day he convinced me to stay. So they did my intake into the inpatient or residential unit, where I stayed for 28 days learning more and practicing skills and slowly getting my feet under me without being violently sick, just well enough to push through. My counselor was there with me every step of the way, all while he was determining my mental state and history, traumas and formulating a very concise insight and diagnoses before sharing them with me and helping me create a plan for treatment for both drug abuse and my mental illness to help me address everything I had repressed. I moved back in to my parents house after my 28 days in inpatient, as my wife and I were separated and I didn’t have a home to go back to. I stayed living at their house for about 5 months using them as a support system and a relapse prevention system. I felt confident but I knew relapse happens to the best of us so I kept my goals realistic. Last month, I moved out of their house into my own apartment after landing a once in a lifetime dream job in March, a job that I feel the chances of were next to nothing as I had more on my record now and hadn’t worked for about 5 months. I was offered the job and took it, I saved a bit for about a month and a half before I felt it was time. I put money down for an apartment while still living with my parents, and got some stuff moved over prior to moving in. My wife and I have been back together since December, we are doing couples therapy along with my therapy, and I am working my way through Intensive Outpatient. I currently have phased up to level 2 which means less classes per week and less responsibilities, I have a great job and a nice apartment, my relationship with my parents and my brothers is better than ever, I am reliable and more trustworthy and I feel again. I feel a love for my wife and sons more than the love I repressed before or numbed myself so much that I couldn’t feel it. I am doing great at my career and feel so much better, I look better and healthy again, and my loved ones are so proud of me which is a feeling I never thought I’d encounter again. I feel pride in myself for once, and I have confidence and as a result my anxiety has gone down. I feel competent, like I’m needed in my work and home life both, and I feel looked at as more of an equal than I have in a long time. I know this post is long and most of you won’t read the entire thing which is okay, I just wanted to get this out there and off of my chest as I haven’t really expressed the entirety of my recent life and world. I just want to say for anyone feeling hopeless.... brother I know. I know how hard it must be for you right now, and how much you’ve struggled. And the truth is I can tell you all day long that it gets better and how, but that isn’t going to matter as much to you as it does to me because you may not be able to see it. There is life and love and happiness after addiction and abuse even if you can’t see the forest for the trees right now. This group is amazing, and if you are reading this and struggling right now, reach out to me. I can talk about anything you want, or I can just listen. I want you to know you’re not alone. Thank you everyone for this group and I will be putting in more effort to be active in this group and help those in need. If anyone needs to talk, message me and I will give you my cell number.

There is some great advice here that isn't nearly as depressing as some IRL group therapy I have attended; where dry alcoholics and addicts alike whine about not being able to reach for their DOC. Instead, there is some great shit here that actually helps with readjusting to normal life. And LOVE the positivity.

The reason for my post is this:

If there are underlying reasons for your drug use, whether they be poverty, abuse or mental health-related, ANYTHING. It is just as important to address those circumstances in order for you to totally recover. 

HOWEVER, the drugs have to go first.

Everything else can wait, no matter what, none of the shit your are using to deal with your other issues is ever going to go away unless you quit using. So, if you're sitting there thinking ""what's the fucking point, my life is fucked anyway"". While that may be true, it is never going to get un-fucked while you're high, it's just going to keep fucking itself and getting darker and darker. Our frequent flyers know, there is always a rock below the bottom.

So, if you're ready, psych yourself up, do what you have to do to prepare to come off, and while you're at it prepare to deal with ALL THAT OTHER SHIT *after*  you're finished with dope.

I apologize in advance for this long-winded post.  My boyfriend (27M)  has struggled with drug addiction with heroin and fentanyl in most of his early and mid-twenties and has been clean for about 2 years. For the first 6 months of our relationship, he was kind, witty, caring. I (23F) loved him with all my heart and was so sure of a future with him. I loved to cook and bake for him and we always enjoyed our time together. About 3 months ago, he started acting...off. I have no past experience with individuals who have struggled with substance abuse, so I thought he was just stressed out with school. he became angry, very negative all the time and when he said or did things that hurt my feelings and I would try to express that to him, he would become defensive and chalk it up to me being delusional or too sensitive because I do have a borderline personality disorder. 

2 weeks ago we had just moved into our first condo and he started to act like..not himself.  One of the weekends I came home to the apartment being a mess, bloody loogies/spit in the sink, dirty dishes in the sink, keys left outside in the door, groceries everywhere and he was in bed. I should have known something was up. I was very upset. I know I hurt his feelings when I told him didn't do anything he was supposed to this weekend in terms of chores. he got really defensive and mocked me. When I asked him to stop mocking me he said ""yea yea yea I don't give a f\*\*k"". that was so unlike him. The morning after this I was still very upset and angry and I shouldn't have been because I said some hurtful things to him such as ""Clean up after yourself"" when he went to get food and ""how can I trust you to have children with if you spoke to me like that last night? Will you speak to our future children like that?"". Fast forward two days, he bought all the furniture for us and built it for us, for which I am very grateful, but he started to have at seemed like abrupt emotional changes and he would become very upset. His nephew also passed away from substance abuse last year and he hasn't been handling it well, and he feels responsible for his nephew's passing. We started to argue more and more in the past two weeks and felt like he became more erratic. 

The breaking point was a few days ago when he was supposed to pick me up after work.  he drives my car as he does not have his own car.  When he dropped me off in the morning (3 AM)  to catch the shuttle he was literally nodding off behind the wheel but trying to act like nothing was happening and that he was fine. I was just utterly confused. When I was finished work, I had given him a rough time estimate of 9-9:30 PM or around there as the shuttle takes around 40 minutes to arrive to the drop-off spot where he was to wait to pick me up. he got there very early, around 8:40, and at this point was really afraid to upset him, so I said I could take an uber home if he was mad. That was my bad. But I updated him on every highway exit I passed so he would know where I was and how close I was to the drop-off point so he could plan accordingly because I was kind of expecting him to drive back to pick me up destination because he drove back to the condo. The pickup point is only 16 minutes away from our condo, but he said I would have to wait ""40 minutes because of traffic""  and if I can't make up my mind to just get an uber. I stood outside alone in the dark for 20 minutes until a lady was kind enough to drive me home. It took 16 minutes for her to get to the condo. When I got inside I was really sad and upset but I tried to hide it so he would not get defensive or start to argue with me. When I saw him, I felt like he was not even my boyfriend anymore. I told him how upset I felt (and made sure to be very calm and speak softly), but he said I came in like a storm and I was attacking him (which I know for a fact is not true), and he basically blamed it on me because I wasn't clear enough about the time of arrival and that he doesn't understand why I'm so upset and then proceeds to bring up my past and all the ways I've ever hurt him and at the end, he tells me I have absolutely no resilience, and ""maybe I need to be humbled just because you're pretty, you think you can get away with anything"", and all the words he was saying to me, just dripping with such disdain and contempt. It got so bad I think I dissociated because I cant remember half of the hurtful things he said to me. I was just sitting in my chair shaking and looking forward. I just remember looking into his eyes and seeing nothing behind them. Just empty eyes. Then I go to my car and it wreaked of marijuana and it's a mess with food crumbs everywhere and dirt. He told me he had hung with friends earlier so I'm assuming he smoked in my car with his friends even though I told him not to do and he has never done this before. I am in such shock and disappointment so I go back up to the condo and go to the bathroom to cry quietly. He comes into the bathroom apologizes for what he said then I leave the bathroom. He proceeds to go to the bathroom, lock the door and run a bath. But the bath never stopped. 20 minutes later I am knocking on the door trying to get him because I hear him make this noise that sounded like a heavy sigh which I knew something bad happened. I used a card to pick the lock and when I finally got into the bathroom he was laying the tub naked, unconscious, with a pipe in his hand and a small bag of blue rocks beside him, which I later learned was fentanyl. I woke him up and he got up as if nothing happened. He said he was fine. The rest of the night was me trying to make sure the drugs stayed in the garbage and he kept trying to retrieve the pipe and keep a small bit of the fentanyl. This went on for about an hour until I realized I can't stop him or parent him, and if he wants to take the fentanyl, he will find a way. So we decided to just go to bed. I couldn't sleep all night. 

Around 7 am, I go through his phone to get the phone number of his sister and sister inlaw and make calls to them telling them what happened and how I need help because I don't know what to do.  They end up driving to our condo, with his father as well (with whom my bf has a bad relationship with) and I coordinate with them to get them up to the condo. My bf refuses to go with them back to their home for a weekend so his father calls the police and he is ultimately escorted to the hospital. My bf put me as his emergency contact. But before the police came, his family left and it was just him and I alone. I felt so emotionally destroyed and afraid, I wanted to leave so I started packing my bags. At that point, I hadn't slept or ate for days because I was so shaken by his behavior. He saw this and started to yell that I was just like every other borderline, how I just go to other guys to get attention (which I do not) that I was just going to abandon him like everyone does (which is not true, he has a very supportive family), how everyone sh\*ts on him and he does everything for everybody, that everything was my fault, that he was going to kill himself because of me, and that I ruined his life. He was hitting things and dented our mental trash can. Over and over again. I could not stop shaking. 

After he was escorted to the hospital, the doctor asked me and his family if we felt it was best to keep him there for a couple of days. I said yes and his family supported my decision. I  didn't want him to be alone because he said he was going to take his life. Soon, I started getting non-stop calls from the hospital, from him, saying the same things. How I had ruined his life, how I need to leave his family alone, how I'm all these nasty things, and because of me, he has a plan to end his life right there in the hospital. He emphasized the  ""because of me"" part a lot. I tried to reason with him that that is why he is there. We can't lose him. He starts to yell at me to ""shut the f\*\*k up, he's not going to kill himself"". At this point, I was so emotionally exhausted and an anxious wreck I just hung up and blocked any more calls from that number, as advised by his father. His family thanks me for what I did and wants me to stay with him after this because ""I am really good for him"". But I don't think they understand this whole thing has emotionally destroyed me. I know if I see him right now I will have a full-blown panic attack and be sick. I moved out of the apartment and moved back home. I feel so many emotions. I feel selfish that I left, I feel like I caused him to relapse and that this is all my fault. that I ruined his life. I also feel confused because maybe I shouldn't feel as upset and shaken up as I do and l maybe this is all in my head like he said. But I feel so bad I cannot function. Since I got home I have just been laying in bed having panic attacks. He made me feel like I have no reason to be hurt and I am selfish for leaving. He says that ""he would never do that to me"", ""he would never leave me"" and that he would never put me in a hospital, and that I am ""f\*\*ked in my head for doing that"".  But I just wanted him to be safe. I am so hurt and emotionally weak right now I just need to be alone and start sleeping eating again. I almost feel traumatized but I am also beating myself up for causing all this, for being mean/angry to him before, and not being there for him when he got out of the hospital. 

Before I left the condo, I got two naloxone kits and wrote him a letter wishing him a healthy and happy future and left it on his desk, but I'm really afraid he is going to be offended or upset that I did that. Am I allowed to leave the condo and him? Is it selfish of me to want to not be around him? Am I being too sensitive, dramatic, and stupid? I can't even trust my own feelings anymore and I just feel so emotionally broken and physically sick. I love him so much and I miss who he was. I care for him so much and want him to be happy again. But maybe I feel like I caused him to not be happy and fall back into a relapse. and I hate myself for that. I feel like I never want to see him again after this and I feel very conflicted. Any advice on what to do or how to feel would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.

I’m 32 and a chronic relapser. First use of opioids was around age 12. Haven’t touched heroin in about five years although I don’t know the exact amount of time. Use poppy seed tea in that time to fill the gap and bounced between it and subs and kratom for a long time. I’m currently tapering down on subs and I’m incredibly depressed and have been doing it pretty rapidly so I feel like shit so much of the day.

I don’t know what to do. Part of me wishes I was kicking a decent heroin habit because I know the worst of it would be over faster. I’m extremely hesitant to go inpatient because of COVID and the health problems I developed from a severe staph infection before I abandoned the needle some years ago. Another part of me wonders how successful I’ll even be at home. I’ve done it at home a million times before and always relapse. And while I am very grateful I stopped using heroin, the discovery of tea and the realization that the seeds are sold all over the damn place in a couple big chains of stores where I live has made it incredibly difficult to stay sober. I can drive in any direction and find a store that has them. Then I get on subs and it’s just a back a forth cycle I’m so tired of... and then I go to detox and they try to encourage me to either stay on subs or get on methadone.

Just feeling... hopeless and honestly worried I will just relapse again in nursing school and fuck it all up.

I hope you don't mind me posting here to ask for some advice. 

I already have an dependency historial with benzos and I refuse opioids or addictive drugs of any kind. I don't want to go through that. But doctors keep insisting offering opioids to me in every visit pretty much and any doctors, because I'm in quite some pain I guess. But I refuse to handle it with opioids. 

Conversations are as follows:

I've tried being direct like:

+""I'd like to know what options do I have, leaving opiates out of the table""

-Then you're leaving half of the options out the table.

+I don't mind, just half sounds very good to me.

-Yeah we really don't have that many other options.

+""I've decided I don't want opiates of any kind""

-Why so? Are you afraid of dependency? Or addiction? What do you think it's going to happen to you? It's OK nothing will happen you can take them. We can give you small doses. I give them to people after surgery all the time and no problem ever.

+OK but it's different if you decide when to take them or have them available at home.

-I can give you some of the less strong ones. Nothings going to happen to you. You can take it no problem.

+""I want to avoid opiates dependency issues and other possible side effects""

-People don't get so addictive. They're safe to use. You don't have to worry.

+""I'm not interested in opiates""

-Well, it's respectable. But why so? (and so on)

+""I don't want opiates"" -Why? (and so on)

+""Please if I say I don't want them don't insist any further""

-I am not insisting, I said it was very respectable (after some of the above...)

+I already had dependency issues with benzodiacepines, I don't want opioids. 

-But this is different, it doesn't have to happen. 

And so on. I tell them such things but as you can see they continue to insist.

My daily doses were every 3 to 4 hours 1.5Tsp. Over the past 48 hours I have cut down to 1Tsp every 3 to 4 hours(5 times a day) a 33% reduction in each dose. The day before I started i woke up with a sore throat and today woke up with another sore throat so I'm think that's not related. What I have noticed is today at work ( day 2) I have noticed some mild to medium cold/hot flashes. My plan is to stay on the 1Tsp every 3 to 4 hours ( 5times a day) for the next 9 to 10 day until my body adjusts and the expanding the time between doses to every 5 to 6 hours (3 to 4 times per day). My plan Is to try to get off or almost off my the first week of july for my birthday and for vacation (even though I probably wont go anywhere). I have been working out 3 to 4 times per week for the last 5 months and will try to increase my workout durations to make my body worn out so hopefully I wont notice withdrawls as much while tapering down. Worsr case scenario is the first week of july I have off work so I can have bad withdrawls and not affect work but I'm hoping that tapering down for the next 5 weeks or so that the withdrawls will be more mild.,4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987165927886963}"

Hello! I am writing from the NYC Department of Health to see if anyone would be interested in this paid opportunity. We are looking for individuals who have lived experience with opioid use disorder and can speak to their experiences in the medical system. The goal of this project is to create a testimonial-style video (in-person with a crew) with real people who tell their stories (good and bad) about healthcare experiences in receiving general medical care and/or substance use treatment. Once completed, this video will be used to train new medical professionals on how to identify and combat stigma towards people who use(d) drugs. Due to the nature of this project, the testimonial will use your face/name and will NOT be anonymous. We understand that the lack of anonymity is a dealbreaker for many people and we do not want to pressure anyone who is uncomfortable with this. We hope that this video will ultimately lead to less stigma in the medical system towards substance use. 

Logistical info: After expressing interest, there will be a very brief phone call to go over basics. If it seems like there is a good fit, we will conduct a virtual Zoom interview to learn a bit more and discuss logistics (compensated $50). Anyone who completes the in-person video shoot will be compensated an additional $500. For mainly logistics-related reasons, we ask that people who contact us be in the NYC area and able to come to a full-day video shoot (sometime this spring/early summer). Because the shoot is in person, we are taking COVID safety precautions extremely seriously.

Here’s how I did it!,"So as the title mentions, I was stuck in a shitty habit, throw in some fentanyl every now and then because half the times the oxy80’s I was getting were Canadian “Green Goblins” that are really fentanyl. 
I lost everything in the span of a few months. I lost my apartment, I lost my girlfriend, I lost my life savings spending around 40K on this shit since the past year and now down to zero dollars. I’m VERY lucky my parents allowed me to move back with them, not everyone has that privilege. In doing so I reached out for help from them and from the local hospital. Went cold turkey with only clonodine and melatonin, not even any weed was used and I plan on staying away from that as well now. 
I figured I couldn’t do this alone so as a result of asking my parents for help they would go on to take all electronics from me so as to cutoff contact with the outside world while I spent 14days in detox at home. That way I’m definitely unable to relapse. 
Within those 14 days I went through hell, but I decided to take the advice of Reddit and really work those endorphins through 1H long cardio sessions. The exercise bike at my parents house has broken electronics so the resistance is stuck on its highest setting which made these 1H workouts very intense. You think you sweat during withdrawal? Wait until you add that onto this routine you’ll be raining from your armpits! 
Of course day 1 I had no energy and skipped out, but day 2 I took a fuckton of vitamins and omega3 pills, then drank a protein shake and worked out until I couldn’t any longer. Each day after I did the same thing. Living without my phone for this period sucked but I used the time to create a poem (lol), a song on guitar, got a 92% in a midterm exam, and dropped from 230lbs to 198lbs. 
Today I got my phone and laptop back so I charged it up and took advantage of my newfound cardio abilities and biked up the tallest mountain in my city which took 2.5hours to complete but the feeling of making it to the top outweighs any feeling opiates ever gave me. Weird, I’m down to zero dollars and lost opportunities but I’ve never been more genuinely happy in my life.

Dr. Jaffe believes the root cause of addiction, the crutch, is mental health and it is the mind that needs healing. Rather too often people are labeled and shamed for their mental health struggles and default of substance abuse.

During the COVID lockdown I was isolated for a year as I live with someone who was most likely to die if they got it and my family wouldn’t let me leave the house. Isolation is worse for me than normal as I had it a lot in my childhood due to abuse and during the lockdown to escape I started to use a Lot of oxy regularly. My day would revolve around me waking up at 5pm, watching stuff on YouTube to get me into my fantasy world, taking oxy then sitting on my balcony all night high, chain smoking and escaping into a world I had created with my music and smokes. This went on the maybe 9 months. I eventually started seeing someone for the addiction and was clean for a few months. I recently had something happen that was emotionally devastating and as I have no family support I started doing oxy again and have been for a month. The sad thing is I am not enjoying it much anymore as I’m very aware that the life I want in my fantasy world I can never have in the real world unless I change my habits and get my life together. It feels like more of a chore now than actual joy and I’m aware of how miserable I feel regardless but I can’t seem to stop at the moment as I don’t feel I have anything else. I don’t know what I’m hoping for out of this, maybe anyone’s personal story of recovery or some advice on what the best thing to do would be as I don’t know who to turn to as I’m dealing with this very much on my own. It just feels like an unending pointless cycle with this drug. I’m trying to achieve a sense of happiness that isint there but I don’t know if I can stop this time. If anyone can help I would be very great full",7,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995305597782135}"

And surprise i got the call and had to explain myself. Damn I felt so miserable having told the doc the day before „no I don’t take any drugs“ while being high af on Xans and Oxy and this went well for too long already, like I made everyone believe I’m not addicted or taking anything. At some point maybe also myself.. Now I gotta stay clean and go cold turkey because the rules are strict for me and I can’t mess this up. Still got shit loads of drugs and I can’t even taper off because I don’t know when they wanna check again and another positive one would make them lose all believe in me and I’d lose my job and everything. And yeah it was my own fault, first got them prescribed for a long time, then they tapered me off (officially) while I was was still taking them though. And my dumb ass had to overdo it and be high all day, being high when the doc sees me and thinking this won’t blow up at some point.
So I’m like only 30hrs of being sober and it feels horrible Ofcourse and the worst is yet to come but this is my only chance of getting any therapy (also for my chronic pain) again. So I gotta be serious about it and can’t miss this up.. I already miss them, but better be sober and suffering wd than losing everything I have",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9962383508682251}"

Before that, 3-5 years of oxy use, roughly 270 mg/day to keep myself out of withdrawal. I finally got off of the oxy after the best man in my wedding got a dirty 30 and died. Since then I don’t think I could find real oxy if I tried, my area is all fent now and I don’t have any desire to start those. 

My husband and I are planning on trying for a baby soon, so I decided I wanted to be off the subs. We had our first while I was on them with no withdrawals or sub-related complications, but I was a goddamn nervous wreck the whole time. I had an anxiety attack that led to a hypertensive crisis that led to an emergency c-section, so I’m not trying to do that again. So before anyone asks why I would want to get off them in the first place, there it is. 

I’m 10 days off now. My symptoms peaked around day 3-4, but the lingering symptoms are fucking beating me down. 3-4 hours of sleep a night, constant sweating. I know that sub withdrawals are a drawn-out affair, but I’m getting so tired of this. I don’t feel awful, but I’m so weak, exhausted and cold/sweaty.

Despite all this I still find that the deep feeling of dysphoria and unhappiness that comes with the physical WD's is making me relapse. 
I don't find the physical side that bad and it doesn't seem to matter how bad the WDs are. I think this because I've been able to overcome pretty strong acute WD's and also relapsed with very minor WD's. 
Anyone got any advice or experience that works in overcoming the debilitating sense that life is rubbish and nothing matters? 
I know this isn't true. I have the ability to rationalize this away most the time and have been able to live and work through this feeling regarding other things. You know, the normal sense of depression that everyone seems to have and get on with it. Work for example.

First off you guys all make up one of the best communities on Reddit .. this place has always been somewhere anyone can come for some words or stories of encouragement and fuel to keep pushing on the path toward a life free of opiate dependency and addiction. Thanks for that.

I’m in a situation that has recently (past 6 months) really gone down hill. I’ve struggled with opiate and poly drug use for the last 10 years or so but the first 5 I would claim were the ‘party’ phase and I was able to hold down a corporate job, fulfill all my responsibilities and pay my bills before getting or thinking about drugs. 

Fast forward another 5 years and it’s gone from the days of actual roxy 30s and crushing them up to come down off a night of coke with friends ... to now choosing to buy bags of heroin and a little bit of crack x7 days a week .. over buying food and other essentials. I’ve worked from home full time since last March when the global situation started and my use has shot up since then. Previously, I was on a subutex prescription and would stop taking it for a couple days and then use for a few days before getting back on the subs. 

I’ve now reached the point where I need to spend 80-100 per day and am smoking a gram or more of heroin and a point or two of crack every single day. This is heroin #3 as I moved from the US to EU during the course of all this. Due to my binging, I’ve been blowing all my disposable income after bills are auto payed within the first 10 days of being paid and I’ve been relying on my two older siblings who, between them have been sending me 30-90 per day for the last couple of months. They are starting to become suspicious and I feel awful abusing their love for me this way. I need to come out and tel them that they can’t send me money like this because it is enabling my addiction. I have some sub left and plan on doing a quick 10 day taper while I work from home. Has anyone had an experience similar to this, or have any insight or words otherwise to share with me?

Been using for a decade now but worse over last 5 years. Only oxy and dillauteds (hydros rarely) and I’m at a low point. I’ve wanted to quit for a couple years but just can’t say no. I use about 100 MG/day when I use but only have 2 connects of my own and 1 of my bro’s. Every 15 days, every 10 days, and random bring me to a few days of clean time per week. I’m basically paying to knowingly feel like shit at this point. The enjoyment of being high is getting lower and lower and lasting shorter lengths for more pills each time. I take care of my family and pay all my bills but that is about it. Everyone reminds me of how stable I used to be and how they looked up to me in some aspects, particularly finances, and now I’m back to pulling cash off of my credit cards. I make decent money and just paid off my truck and CC bills but the wife isn’t working rn so lost a lot of income, which of course as I barely scrape by I now I realize all that went to my habit. Ran out of savings and just started pulling off cards again (just paid off from last years Fuck up) and it’s really hitting me that I don’t feel good on pills, and feel worse coming down off them, with so little clean time in between I’m really paying to feel like shit. Spending money I don’t have to feel like shit. Wasn’t as big a deal to me when I enjoyed it but now it’s just stupid. I don’t go looking for pills but as soon as my bro calls or the day of the month come around I say yes without even thinking or when I’m screaming NO in my head.

I’ve always thought methadone was too much for me and since I didn’t use daily (though almost) that I shouldn’t replace one for another that I would use daily for sure.....I wish I had the will power to say no when they call or block the ones I can or move away again (only clean stretch longer than days) but I just can’t bring myself to do it. My bro and I go back and forth as the only 2 in our circle to have plugs and I feel like I’m letting him down if I don’t buy some when he gets them and would be letting him down more if I stopped getting mine. Same with my 2 connects. Both dependent on the $ to live, though one of them could sell elsewhere, so don’t want to let them down either even if it is absolutely killing me. 

Short of being able to say no or move away I’m starting to think that getting on methadone is one of my only options if I stay here so that even if I want to say yes my body wouldn’t accept it so I wouldn’t spend the money?

I’m sick of being sick and putting my family last with the justification of them having a roof over their heads and food in their mouths, I’m sick of putting things off until I have pills, I’m sick of needing a “hair of the dog” to function the following day, I’m sick of not enjoying anything at all anymore, I’m sick of pushing people away, Im sick of my body hurting and adding more BS to my fucked up teeth and lungs, I’m sick of not having money to spend, I’m sick of paying off my bills to start racking them up again with nothing to show for it, I’m sick of my entire life revolving around getting and using a damn pill.

I'm super proud of myself. I was holding onto a false belief that it would be impossible to stay clean during this pandemic, because of social distancing and lack of in-person groups (online meetings don't do much for me), and in turn, it sort of became true. I'm sure we all know too well about the curse of the self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Since then, I've given myself the chance to try new methods of recovery, particularly doing 12 step work that I've never tried before, and getting in touch with my spiritual side and connection to my higher power. Meditating, yoga and playing the shit out of my bass have all brought me such genuine joy. Even if I never forget the memories of how good heroin made me feel and how much withdrawal made me hurt, I plan on staying on this path indefinitely as it's a hell of a lot more comfortable than having my contentment revolve around consumption. I'm aware of the dangers of the pink cloud and complacency. Staying clean has always been my biggest hurdle to overcome, but now I have specific methods and a loving support system (my family and girlfriend) to help me address that. There were thoughts and cravings here and there in the first few days, which I realize I can't control. Previously, I've tried so hard to fight those thoughts, or make it so that I wouldn't have them, obviously to no avail.

It helped me learn and kept me remembering recovery is possible. Thank you all for that.

I was stuck in a cycle of addiction and I thought I was being abused because I was an addict and therefore deserved it, however my realization was I was in a cycle of abuse that never ended even once I became an adult. That fueled the cycle of addiction and it was one big circle seemingly impossible to get out of. I made a plan to use sub to break dependance and then quit sub too.


Going to aa(I am anti-religion btw)helped me hear from other old school junkies to help fix my thinking(of course not every meeting will have awesome helpful ex-junkies but if you go to enough you will find something to help you,as the saying goes take what you need and leave the rest.

Off my aa soapbox. I understood noone would pay for rehab for me and I didn't think it was possible at the state provided options where they forbid weed. My addiction was really bad, I was buying oc80s for $20 back 10 years ago and never really quit until jan 2020.. 


The pain was immense, i used edibles to help leg pain and dabbed all day until I didn't need to and next quit smoking and drinking entirely.


The realization of being stuck in an abusively minded house hold and finally getting clean was a trip. I was screamed at in the midst of the worst withdrawal, gaslit, verbally abused by a paranoid narcicist. and through it all did not relapse. I feel noone is beyond saving but also it is tough to deal with what I understand to be a personality disorder so ingrained in them that everything is a battle. But I did it and am doing it and I hope you can too. I hope I can help inspire those thinking about making an action plan to take their life into their hands again. My biggest worry was I loved opiates so much I truly thought I couldn't love anything else, but once you get clean the love does come back. It might take a few months but

But that was yesterday! Today feels like the first day of the rest of my life and I don't care how cliché that sounds! Felt a bit ""bleegh"" for lack of better words, this morning. But as soon as I had my fried eggs and herbal tea and washed my face, I was straight out the door! Full of new strength and confidence i went down to the doctors the get the forms i need to fill out. Then went down to my parish priest for a chat and to ask about volunteering at the church (I'm not particularly religious but Catholicism is big part of the culture where I'm from and that Jesus guy seems like a pretty chill dude)
Then I got home and cleaned my stinking burnt up smokey AF oven , sprayed that cleaner stuff and maaaaan did I scrub! It's literally spotless now , pretty much like new, and that thing has been annoying me for months! 

Today is the one year anniversary of my brother's funeral so I cooked up a lovely little meal and me and my Mam (who I've recently gotten back in my life yay!)  walked down to the beach and had a lovely little picnic in his memory. I walked my Mam home and then instead of heading home I walked around town for a bit, bumped into people I used to use with and it didn't bother me at all, didn't give me any cravings at all,quite the opposite actually, I just gave them my love and cigarettes and told them ""I'm sorry but I can't hang out"" and they were really happy to see one of us doing well, I still try and avoid bumping into all these people but I live in a real small town. Went home then to get a drink and just in the spur of the moment decided to go down to the beach and was walking around for like 2hrs, could feel my bro in the wind, was amazing. 

The contrast from yesterday to today is just unreal. I'm doing stuff, and getting the healthy natural dopamine rewards and I just feel so so so so great! Not letting myself get too excited though, I don't wanna over do it and end up chasing fake highs again! 

Trying not to think *too* much about the future cause it can be really overwhelming tryna decide what to do with your life without being in recovery so I'm not gonna add that stress to my plate. 

I get paid at the end of the week , and while I have had some fleeting thoughts in the back of my head but I just tell them to fuck off and I know for a fact I'm not gonna score! Gonna get myself an electric toothbrush , my teeth already look so much better! Gonna get a pair of nice walking boots, cause as fun as the beach is, wet sandy socks are not! Also thinking of getting myself a guitar, used to love shredding away when I was youn but never learned any chords or anything so I think that will be fun to learn! So exciting!! 

I smoked a shit tonne of weed during the first week and half and that really helped but the past few days I think it was holding me back. I've run out now so it'll be the weekend before I could get some. Gonna try rationing it out and just having one nice doobie down on the beach in the evening after I've done the day. If I can't do that though I'm just gonna give it up for a while , I like how it makes me happy but takes too much energy and motivation away smoking during the day, with me personally anyway. So next week we'll see if I'll either be a responsible smoker or if it's just another vice I need to drop. 


So to anyone who's still going through the horrible cold sweety achy phase, trust me it gets better. 
If you wanna speed your recovery along perhaps try these things I did. 


~Drink copious amounts of water all day long, you'll be peeing every ten minutes nearly but you wanna flush those toxins out! 

~Take vitamins or drink multivitamin drinks, the supplement tablets vegans take are great too , cause remember your bodys tryna repair all these differents systems inside ya - so give it some help :) 

~Wash as soon as possible in the day , might sound silly to some, but if your anything like me it could take you up til the end of the day just to build up the mental strength to hop in the shower but believe me , the sooner you go and wash yourself (even if it's just in a bucket or even the sink like me[which was a bastard at first but I'm like a pro now lol]) the sooner you'll be feeling better. Especially if you have a shower, it'll get that grime off ya, ya won't feel so sweaty for a while, and it'll just sooth your soul and make you feel better, the earlier you can do that the easier your day is gonna be :) 

~Eat something God damn it!! I know this is soooo hard for soooo many people, including myself. Ok so if you're on your first couple days and your getting sick a bunch maybe your not ready for food yet , but try and drink something like one of those fruity multivitamin effeverscent tablet thingys (Berrocca is the big expensive brand but you can get cheap ones in most supermarkets) because atleast with them you'll get the nutrients your body's craving, but if your a few days ahead of that, make yourself eat, even if it's 1 mouthfull you can manage thats ok, later on or the next day you'll eat more. Your body's healing, it's a lot of work so it needs some fuel in there. I was feeling a bit nasty and groggy after eating up until today actually , but each day was easier, I could eat more and I'd always get a big boost of energy an hour or so after which really helps with my next point!

~Get active and make your space nice! So just like with everything else I've mentioned this is gonna be much harder at first but it gets easier and easier to do each day. Ok so when I was using and doing my rattle this place was a pig sty, but after the first few days of heavy withdrawals I started forcing myself to get up and say just bring the cups and glasses into the kitchen and leave them next to the sink. Then I'd probably get a head rush, go white blind for a second and come to on the floor, but I was (a teeny bit) proud that I got up and did *something*. Then as the days passed I was able to do more and more and more and as I got the sitting room clear and tidy I started to feel so much better, then I blitzed the kitchen , bathroom , the place is looking pretty nice now and it feels amazing. So your kinda doing a few different things that really help here, one is your training your brain to start enjoying accomplishing goals again, your making, your making your surroundings nice which will give you a massive mental health boost seems silly but it works wonders for you and your also moving around which is so important! Don't over exert yourself or you'll be exhausted but don't sit around all day cause it'll make you way more exhausted than even over doing it! 

Okay one more and I'll finish, just realised how long this is lol 


~Don't bother tryna sleep it off, maybe at the very very  start you might be able to sleep a bunch until your symptoms get heavy. But see when you wake up in the morning? At like 4am or whatever?  I wouldn't bother tryna go back asleep , in my experience I just end up feeling worse and worse and worse until I get up, so after a few days I just started forcing myself outta bed , even if I was just sat on the couch for hours still better than lying there. Keep as active as you feel your able to be during the day, try and accomplish a goal each day even if it's a tiny little thing you still achieved your goal. Dont try go to bed early neither, your either gonna wake up in 25 mins feeling 25 times worse. Wait til it's late and you actually feel tired, heavy eyes etc etc *THEN* hit the hay and you should get a nice 6 hours then. I've done a 100 withdrawals and I know how much of a bitch not being able to get to sleep is and hopefully these will help you in your journey. 


I've tried to give as much info as I can here but I could go on all night about this, if anyone wants me to explain something a bit more or has any questions or even criticisms please say, I'm open to all feedback :)

My understanding is that you have to be withdrawing pretty bad before you can take the first dose of subs - how long do you have to go without methadone for? I don't handle withdrawal well at all and I have an 11 month old son to look after so I need to be able to function. I'm dreading the switch - has anyone done it? What's it like?

I went to rehab and went cold turkey. The main withdrawal sympotm that kicked my butt was the restless legs while trying to sleep. While in rehab for 2 week I got maybe 16 hours of actual sleep. Everytime I was about to fall asleep my legs would spasm and wake me back up Along with waking up a few a few times drenched in sweat. After getting out of rehab 2 weeks sober I still couldnt sleep at all. I ate healthy and excersized while i was in rehab and took daily vitimans. After rehab I ended up taking Kratom which instantly helped with the sleep. Now almost 5 years later I want to stop taking Kratom. I have been taking it daily 4 to 5 times daily 1.5tsp per dose. When I stop taking it and go into withdrawls since it affects the same receptors what can I do about the restless legs or to help with sleep. I have been working out almost daily for the past 5 months and eating alot more fruits so I have a good habit of that which should help with the symptoms.

I have an appointment at a clinic tomorrow morning and am terrified with no idea what to expect. Methadone is probably the absolute last treatment route I ever wanted to take but the fentadope has made suboxone impossible (pws) and the current batch my guy has has me fully sick within 3 hours, and constantly throwing up vile with no relief after 6 hours. Even when im driving to meet him which usually makes me feel 80% better, Ive thrown up on myself twice while driving. So things are very very desperate and very very scary :(
But my methadone appointment, while quelling some of my anxiety, is also creating a mess of it's own. My biggest fear is getting off. If I had a street sourxe I would ideally just do a 7 day rapid methadone detox at home to get me through wd instead of having to fully get on it myself. The last thing i want is to end up feeling like ive put myself in an even worse situation than I began in. Does anyone have experience with getting off as quickly as possible and still having a bearable w/d? Im really afraid of the length of methadone wd and dont know how ill ever get off if Im going through acute w/d for weeks to months, but also desperately dont want this to be a very long term or permenant thing 😢
Also, the last thing i was wondering is should i be worried that Ill still be sick tomorrow or the following days? Ive heard most clinics start you at 30mg no matter what, is this enough to keep someone whos never done methadone (but has a fairly big h/f habit) well?

i learned the lesson and stopped everything, but these last weeks i took 150mg one or two nights because i have some trouble sleeping and i sleep very well when taking tramadol. Its a coward solution i agree but im not in a reasonable mood for multiple reasons but anyway thats my fault i agree. 

SO last wednesday night and last thursday night i took 150mg on wednesday and 100mg on thursday. And then took 150mg on sathurday night. Today we're sunday its 9pm and i experience withdrawal symptoms?? i know you can experience withdrawal even for short periods of time of taking tramadol but im surprised... i didn't expect it at all, even more with the fact that i ""only"" take 150mg of tramadol for the highest. 

So i took 100mg because i couldn't handle the symptoms and i plan to reduce doses to avoid the withdrawal...

Basically, I’m clinging to the metaphorical coattails (or the cobalt blue scales that leave callouses behind on my palms as rough as chain mail) of the antagonist I’ve laid to bed with every night since the very dawn of my adolescence.

To speak outside this abstract rhetoric I’ve tediously begun to establish in a feeble attempt to assign poetic intent to a concept that in and of itself is nothing close to art, not even a distant relative. Yes, I will get to the point now that I’ve been tip tip toeing around as if there were freshly cracked eggshells scattered on the rough and jagged ground: about 15 minutes ago I inhaled the very last breath of dope that I desperately hope more than anything else in this world will be the last of the toxic fumes I invite into my body in this incarnation. 

In less than 10 hours I will be on an Amtrak, with 2 suitcases, a duffel bag, and my beloved black cat, headed towards the horizon of a new chapter of my life. And God, I already miss the high, I already miss the emptiness of floating somewhere inside of my head that made me feel as if I might not actually have to return from the clouds and continue my existence. 

(I feel guilt even admitting this, but part of me always *always* wished that my physical shell would slow down until my essence could truly escape from the prison bars in my chest- made of calcium, called my rib cage.) 

What else is there to say about it really? I didn’t die, my mother won’t have to bury her 24 year old baby, no matter how hard I might have tried (consciously or unconsciously) my spirit and my body stubbornly have always clung tight to this life.

I don’t know why, but I’ll find out eventually and in the words of my father that is a “certain degree of peace.”

I wonder then, how long after the hunger sets in for a taste of the utter absence- the reprieve I traded my soul to receive... the gift of not having to be anything more than my physicality present - my tortured mind finds a moment of freedom after endlessly and ruthlessly being flayed alive day and night by my own personal trauma-fed demons, yes, the price that I paid to escape the constant and oh so secret pain... the squishy pink matter locked inside my skull.... you would have traded anything asked of you too, trust me.

And now I got no dope for the foreseeable future, and by that I mean no dope, ever again (*despite how bad I already fuckin want it, after less than 30 minutes*) and I got no soul if you compare me to who I am when my spirit and psyche are whole.

I realized a lot this time around during abuse. The obvious is this does nothing but destroy me, but also that this is the last thing my mother would want for me, she made that clear when she was alive. Also, I just want better for myself.  Anyways, I've been using good ol H again. I was using subs and it became unavailable, so I started h. I want off the H. Also, I do have subs at the moment. How do I use the suboxone when I start to feel the sickness setting in? Also, I am not asking for medical advice, just what worked for individuals here. It is suboxone I will be using (8mg bupe/2mg naloxone) to hopefully get away from h. Last time I did this, I divided the sub strip into 4 pieces. When 24 hours had elapsed from my last H dose, I put 1 portion of the strip (in theory, that 1/4 of a strip would be dosed at 2mg bupe/0.5 mg naloxone). I waited till most of it dissolved and was left with whatever wouldn't, and spit it out. I continued this every half hour till 1 whole strip was gone. The reason why I spit out the remainder was because I believed it was majority naloxone, since it has poor bioavailability when used sublingually (I believe the bioavailability is at 20-30%). It worked for me last time, but am not sure if it will this time around. Does anyone have any other solutions or methods? Last, and it is just my opinion, but I would rather come off of subs than H/opiates.

I’m starting to feel like my normal self again. This is my third detox. First was with pressed 30’s quit pretty easy, second was brown h (7 months use) 6 months clean after that, this time it was the straight white. I thought I was disciplined enough to only do one on the weekends back in December 2020, but you know where this story goes. So my girlfriend invited me with Florida May 11th-17th and I thought it would be the perfect time to get clean. I planned to stop a week before to not be in full withdrawal in Florida but of course I did my last hit before I got the the airport secretly. Today (day 4.5) is starting to end all the physical symptoms and I know I’m gonna get through it. (I went as far as walking the streets at night while she was asleep trying to find something and got robbed for $40 by getting powder sugar. I think that was some higher power giving me a blessing in disguise. But my big problem is when I get home. I know I have a stash waiting for me, I know most of my friends are addicts, and to top it off I’m an MMA fighter who has somehow been able to perform at elite level with this stuff and have a fight in July. I’m just so scared because I just wanna go home and do that bag knowing I can’t afford it. Please I feel hopeless this time because the other times I didn’t want anything to do with them (initially) after detox. I know it’s only day 4.5 but I just want to remove the chains that are holding me back from life. I almost ruined my relationship over this vacation trying to get clean but being off so many Xanax gaba and clonidine i was a sloppy zombie. Okay you guys get the picture, I’m 25 years old and I would love all your kind words to help me or just any direction to give me. I have a therapist and a MAT doctor but I’m able to use fake pee...

My life is crumbling all around me as if I were from Jericho, can’t remember most anything that’s been happening, but of all the things that I do not know- there is one that I am sure of. This misery and destruction of everything in my life that I find joy in... it will only get more and more horrific, the snowball will only pick up speed and grow in size if I do not arrest it. 

I’ve desperately been wanting to seek treatment, what’s been stopping me is the fact I’ll lose my place of living, I’ll lose my job, but I can live with those things- it’s mostly
Been the fact that i have a 4 year old cat and haven’t been able to find someone to take care of him while I’m away for treatment for 30+ days. It’s been hell knowing that I need help but being unable to take action to get any.

Tonight my good friend agreed to take him in, though she’s 12 hours away in the area I grew up in. I could’ve used the distance as another excuse to refuse to help myself and I very nearly did... but I didn’t. I booked an Amtrak ticket and decided to check into my old treatment facility that helped me a lot a few years ago as it’s in the same area and is a bigger facility with more resources than the ones where I live. 

So I’ll be on the train this time tomorrow, and in the facility in less than 48 hours. From detox I’m hoping for residential, and when that’s finished I’m going to be staying with that same friend who will have my cat for a while and do outpatient, and after that who knows. My future is completely up in the air and totally unsure, which is terrifying. The alternative, however, the future that I see for myself if I don’t make an effort to help myself (and FAST)... that is 100000x scarier than the unknown. 

Because it is only a matter of time before I lose it all anyway if I keep going on this way- including, more than just possibly, my very life.

Eventually I couldn't resist going back to dope. So the other week I started trying to chip again (which I've never been successful at). I'm stubborn tho so I keep trying.  Got dope from another source then 2 days later after shooting up woke up to cops and parents over my body. 3 narcans and a trip to the ER. I had more dope tho so I continued using for days after the overdose. Now I've run out and my family wants me to do treatment or leave. I'm 30 and have money so I could leave.

I still want to use heroin. Logically I want to get sober and stay sober but the feeling heroin provides is just too amazing to give up.

I am almost 7 months clean which is a personal best since 2001and at the moment I am living in a sober house and have been in the program I am in since the end of January I am not going to get into all of the events that lead up to me blowing up but it was a lot. So (and I do get where she's coming from, trying not to see things in black and white) So at the start of our second half of group the counselor running the group asked if anyone needed to get something off their chest, he knew I was a little off, I am usually upbeat and positive and alway have a smile on my face so I was definitely ""wearing my feelings"" so I get into all the shit that I went through over the past few days and am pouring my heart out because in recovery when you have a ""buring desire"" you are supposed to get it all out so people can know what is going and either relate or talk you off the edge so to speak. So I am getting into everything and my counselor comes barging in and tells me ""to stop talking and come and talk"" and my response was not the best but, ""are you fucking kidding me?"" You're not going to let me say what I want to say?"" I just want them.....she cut me off and said it's time for our one on one.

Needless to say I pretty much snapped in her office and said I have never seen anyone get cutoff like that in a group or at a meeting.  She said she knew where I was going and that the people in the group didn't need to hear it. Oh so I have to hear how you feel about it but you didn't extend me that same courtesy in the group? Also I  sent her a text yesterday explaining all the bullshit I was going through but she said she woke up to it and was sleeping when I sent it which I understand, it was around 10PM by the way, but she had all of today to reach out. She  didn't see me until 730 tonight. She""may have dropped the ball"". That did not help....at all. After that I was livid tears ensued and I shut down. 

Sorry for ranting but getting interrupted while talking while I am sharing was a first for me myself and a first for any group or meeting. Definitely thought about ""re""doing a ""lapse"" of judgement. Luckily I was able to get back to my sober house and breathe all the fire out my lungs to one of my housemates. Long story short be smart make smart decisions. Recovery starts and can easily end with one decision stupid decision.

About 6 months ago I came off 12 years of Suboxone. I went through hell for months but started to feel better about 4 months after stopping it. Like clockwork the cravings started to kick in, and to make matters worse I'm tapering off Valium and right when I started feeling better from the opiate withdrawal I went right into benzo withdrawal and it was too much to take on. Last month I started taking kratom in hopes of curbing the cravings, but I still ended up smoking tar a few times. Then last week the guy I go through said he had some fentanyl and asked if I wanted to smoke it. I took a few rips and got the most insane rush throughout my body which didn't feel good. It felt like my body was shutting down and it was disorientating. After that subsided I felt super high. This past week I was smoking very small amounts each day just to get a small buzz and it seemed to work. Then this morning I smoked a chunk smaller than a pea and I only remember taking two rips. The next thing I know I'm coming to in my room with a bunch of paramedics and firefighters around me. It was surreal and felt like a dream. Fortunately they didn't have to give me narcan and I came to on my own. Later when I got out of the ER my mom told me she heard me gasping for air from downstairs so she went to my room and found me with my eyes wide open trying to take a breath. She shook me and cried for me not to leave her, and really thought I was dying in front of her. I thought I was being careful by only smoking small amounts of fentanyl, but remember this stuff is pure poison and unbelievably potent. Right now I feel like crap and the withdrawals seem to have kicked up, but I'm happy to be alive and have another shot at staying clean.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9842687845230103}"

I'm an addict. Currently 75 hrs in, but I feel fine, because I just had 14 days and only used for a couple days, sure I can't sleep and my mental is fucked up. But, at least I'm not tossing and turning in bed and puking on myself. I had 4 years clean and relapsed. 4 years clean after a 10 year habit. 5 on real oxy and 5 on real H, I assume. So I relapsed for 3 months got sick and put together 40 days..Took an oxy and then started using H again, but only for 4 or 5 days out of the week. Once my habit got bad enough the gram of H (10 bags) started to only last 4 days not 5..So i would withdrawl, every week Fri-Mon until I picked up Monday morning again..It stayed like this for a few months. Putting 4 days of clean time every week, but those days suck..Not full blown withdrawls, but enough to fuck up your next 3 days..Now I'm putting together 8 days..12 days..17 days, clean, and then using for 4 days or 7 days, and feel a bit shitty for a couple days, but nowhere near as bad as it was when I was consistently using mon-thur. I literally just had 14 days and picked up some oxy. I didn't get sick after the oxy..but 2 days later I picked up a gram of H, and used that for 7 days and it definitely through a wrench in my mind state and physical, but like I said, I'm 75 hrs in and the only thing that's bad is I can't sleep. I guess I'm here, because I want my life back, and I don't know what to do. Man! When I first got clean and out of rehab I was the most adamant mother fucker on staying clean...My girl died, I had nothing, I wasn't getting high anymore just maintenance. I was soo ready. One little mistake, and the drug is all consuming. I can't even get drugs where I am..im telling myself the next time I'll be able to get drugs is in 40 days..But I don't want to do it. But I'm literally planning my relapse..When all I wanna do is get my mindset back that I had months ago at my 4 year mark. Anyways, I don't even know why I typed this, guess I just wanted to introduce myself and have some people to talk to.

 When I take opioids, I take \~100mg of tramadol/day or \~1.25g of a strong kratom extract/day.

I’ve been on nothing but methadone for about 3 years now but I obtain the methadone on the street and am not part of a methadone program.
I take it responsibly and do not plan on getting off anytime soon.  I hope people don’t get hung up on this part.  I have not told my primary who I have just started seeing.  My other primary doctor I saw for years retired and I never shared this info with him either.

I have a Dr appt tomorrow with my Primary Dr.  I had some tests done and all I know is my thyroid is elevated and he wants to have further testing done.  

My question is should I tell  my Dr. I’m on methadone?  I realize there is a good chance it is the cause of my hormone imbalance.  Do the pros out weigh the cons having myself labeled an addict on my medical record?  What are some of the cons that may affect me by telling my primary doctor?  

I obviously realize what the ethical thing to do is here but I am hoping to get some honest advice as to how this may negatively affect me by having this on my medical record.  I live in Illinois(not sure if privacy or whatever  varies by state)?  Will it affect future employment, insurance, or obtaining things like sleep aides(not that important just curious) in the future.  Anything else I didn’t think of that it could affect?

Tramadol to take 300mg daily, loperamide, ibuprofen and maybe i forgot something but those are the most important.

About me:  24 Year Old Male Born in USA

Age 13 -14: Hookah and Smoke Cigarettes

Age 14-20: Smoked Weed, Cigarettes and went to raves frequently popping MDMA every chance I get

Age 20: MDMA use took over and I felt it. It was very easy for me to quit all I had to do was stop buying festival tickets. When I realized how terrible MDMA was for my young brain it scared me from touching it ever again (4.5 years).

Age 24: ADDICTED TO ANY HIGH !

Notice how my timeline skipped 4 years? These 4 years of my life was a big BLUR. From the moment I woke up until I passed out I needed to be high on something. I began taking Xanax religiously. Before I knew it I was on 4-6 2mg Xanax a day. While taking Xanax I felt invincible. Throughout these 4 years I was making great money so I felt good like everything was under control. WRONG. I need a new section for this portion of my life.

Jan 2020- Present: DRUG COCKTAILS

6 Xanax bars a day
3-5 Oxycodone 30mg per day
Promethazine Codeine (when around)
Weed all day morning to night

This was a really bad time. I felt unstoppable making $1000 a day some days only to realize I spent $500 just to get high that day. I felt like a young El Chapo lol. I had women around me so I thought I looked as good as I felt until this happen.

At the beginning of 2020 I looked in a mirror and saw a MONSTER. My physical health was at rock bottom. I lost near 50 pounds unintentionally. I felt weak like all my muscles had left my body. Basic day to day tasks felt like long intense workouts. This is when I realized I need help. Upon observation of my poor malnutrition physical health I told myself I need to stop. 

2021 :I told myself I needed help and I would stop last year but here I was still addicted to the cocktails. I would wake up around 12-1PM get very high and work until 2-3 AM squeeze in a midnight jack in the box run and pass out and repeat.

ROCK BOTTOM 2021: It was right before the beginning on May 2021. A friend called me over to help him with his garden. I drove for 20 minutes to his house and called him and he said he was running late. No problem. I reach into my bag and decide I’d take a Xanax (my script) and a Narco 10/325 (Not mine). I was saving the M30s for after. My friend ends up coming home and I park my car and get to work. I was holding a plant one second and then I wake up. Woke up on a stretcher confused. Medic says “we hit you with Nar can and you woke up , what did you take?” I yelled 10mg narco and passed out again. I wake up again in the ER. WTF IS GOING ON?! The medic says “your heart stopped we had to Nar-can you 3 times” they did a toxicology test and found FENT 2mg in my blood. NEVER HAVE I TOUCHED FENT...HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?! THE NARCOS ARE FAKE. NOBODY KNOWS THIS YET... MIND RACING...... IF I DONT LEAVE THE ER NOW SOMEONE MIGHT TAKE MORE THAN 1 & POTENTIALLY DIE. The medic dosent advise I leave but I’m panicking so I leave anyway..I was right the narcos were fake fentanyl pressed. THANK GOD I DIDNT DIE. I WAS GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE...IF TODAY DIDNT HAPPEN I WAS OFF TO VEGAS THAT WEEKEND...I WOULD HAVE TAKEN 3 10mg aka 6MG FeNT and died... or worse gave it to a buddy and their death would haunt me for life.

When fentanyl hit Canada in 2012, I was horribly addicted. I went to federal prison in 2015 and got out in 2018 and I continued using. In 2020, I got clean and haven’t had a slip of any kind or a relapse of any kind since. I got on suboxone and it literally erased my craving for opiates. Literally gone. It’s like I don’t even know they exist anymore and my life has improved so much in so many ways. I found my love of guitars and music again, wrote an entire album. Saved my money and recorded said album and it’s dropping May 20th. Formed a band and I’m having the time of my life playing. Married my girlfriend and found non using friends. I credit Microdosing mushrooms with helping me get through one of the most painful things in my life, hands down. I wake up happy and healthy and I love every minute of my life when 7 short months ago, I didn’t give a fuck if I died or not.

I made it about 6 weeks and then very consciously relapsed. Then had a minor surgery last month and got 10 pills and couldn’t be cool. So yeah, I’m an addict. And I’m fucking ashamed of myself because I read stories from people who have battled through addictions so much stronger than mine and here’s me whining and not be able to be strong over a couple pills. I rarely have physical symptoms, it’s all completely mental. So am I really so weak? I guess so. 

The worst and weirdest part to me is that when I first started taking them after my son was born, I definitely had PPD and the pills cheered me up. These days I’m pretty much the happiest I’ve ever been. Life is good, I take a lot of pleasure in my hobbies, started working out again. I’m not trying to fill a hole or anything. Yet I just can’t stop. I finally want to and I can’t. My husband is aware but not of my recent relapses. I’m sure he would be so disappointed. 

I’ve gotten tons of great advice and support here in the past and I don’t understand why people can quit things like heroin and yet I convince myself that I need a few stupid pills. Like yes, I get that my brain has rewired itself but also where is my self-control? I’m to the point where I’m considering asking my doctor about Vivitrol although I feel like that’s ridiculous.  All I know is that on my son‘s birthday last year, I was super grouchy because the doctor was dragging her feet about giving me a refill, and I thought for sure I would be done with all this by his next birthday. And yet here I am.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9658970236778259}"

It's just funny (not actually funny) but decide to clean myself up and that damn thing called reality hit. 
Caught minor charges back in September for possession n a DUI, on unemployment bc of covid and of course last week got all fucked up bc NJ updated the system so I couldn't file, my engine blew in my car the day before I moved and they just moved my mom to hospice with stage 4 cancer and I am also dealing with a minor cancer issue (male cancer issue). 
Guess this is more for venting and or giving hope. Not sure which one but I do know that life can be great and fun, filled with love, sunshine and good days but man some of the bad days are just so fuckn bad it's almost like everything gets stacked against you. Of course I hate that drug but still a part of me would love to get fucked up just to escape but that's all it would be. A temporary escape that could come with massive repercussions. 
I hope anyone out there who is getting clean, been clean or thinking about getting clean just remember life is tough, add an addiction and it's even tougher but when you wake up and have an unplanned just plain old good day, enjoy it. Try to remember them when you have those tough days and if u fuck up, just keep trying to do better.

So Ive been using (""h,"" though I think it's probably mostly fent) for about 5 years now. My boyfriend and I meet the same guy every time so we're using the same thing for at least a few months at a time before he reups to something new. Around the begining of the year, it got noticeably stronger and our Wds did a complete 360. It went from being able to get by 24 hrs without feeling too bad at all (mostly just entirely mental cravings) before the symptoms really set in to being in pretty freaking rough shape 6-12 hours after the last line. So its scared the shit out of me, and I desperately want to get clean. 
Rehab/detox feel impossible to bring myself to go to because A) Wd is already such hell and medical settings terrify me, so I cant imagine going through it without the comfort of my own home and distractions. B) no one in my life knows, so what should feel like something my family would be proud of me for would actually probably feel like quite the opposite. C) also dont have insurance but ive heard mixed thing about whether or not I could still get in somewhere 
So I've been trying to taper, I bought myself a timer lock to keep me from messing up at first, and now im at about .045g every 5-6hrs (with an extra .045 before bed) im at a point where im feeling desperate to rip the bandaid off and just get through it, or at least start speeding up my taper, but now within 6-8 hours of using im getting horrible and terrifying brain zaps? I havent gone much past 8 hours, but my boyfriend does his bun all at once and then starts to wd 12-24hrs later, hes had to go to about 36hrs a couple times and said as time went on, along wih the zaps worrsening, he also hears a constant roaring ""swoosh"" sound in his head? 
Everything I look up says this isnt possible from opiates but instead only: antidepressants, benzos, adderrall and MDMA. I doubt antidepressant wd would set in so quick, and also think wed mentally be feeling pretty effed up if we were dosing antidepressants this way. Benzos: even when ive done bigger lines to actually get high my pupils pin but my coordination and memory are completely unhindered so it doesnt feel like a benzo high. Also I take .25-.5 mg of xanax occasionally for panic attacks and dont think the .25 would still help me if it turned out i was doing it daily, Im sure my tolerance would be much higher. Adderall: absolutely not. Its 100% not in there. MDMA: Ive never done it but I reallyyyyy dont think so?
Does anyone have any idea what this could be from? Im terrified of letting it get worse because it feels like Im going to have a seizure or something but desperate to start pushing through a little more wd/discomfort to lower my taper :( :(",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984856247901917}"

I spoke with my brother 31 every single day via Facebook Messenger. He last messaged me / ""saw"" my messages on the morning of April 26, and never responded or ""saw"" another message again. Between April 26 and May 5, I started to get really angry. It was pretty typical of my brothers to not respond to messages (they only communicated via FB and did not own cellphones) and it was always impossible to plan events or anything like that with them. They were endlessly unpredictable and impossible to communicate with and get a hold of. Usually, when they went ""dark"" like this, is meant they were using. However, I didn't really suspect anything. I was just insanely frustrated as my Dad and I were trying to get ahold of them to plan a BBQ for my mother for today, Mother's Day. After not hearing anything for several days, I told my boyfriend that I would have to go the ballistic route which I had employed a couple times in the past and just drive over to their apartment and knock on the door. I basically said to him if they didn't respond to me by the end of the night on May 5, I would just go over there. I am really glad I didn't.

The thing is - our family had been led to believe that both these boys had been clean for about 2 years. My brother 31 had recently completed suboxone treatment. Last summer, our family had a big BBQ party to celebrate his first year of sobriety and I won't lie, it was one of the most fun and happiest days of my entire life. After years and years of pain and suffering and worry caused by my brother's lifestyle, I finally felt as though we were out of the woods, our family was going to be a complete family again, and my parents and I finally let our guards down. Why would we have to keep them up anyway? Both our boys were clean, and swore they'd never go back.

Anyway. During the period between April 26 and May 6, I definitely had the thought that they might be using again, because it had been quite a while since the last time I had experienced a lack of response from my brothers. We talked every single night to discuss that evening's episode of TimCast IRL, or the Tim Dillon Podcast (among many other podcasts), or the rise of DOGEcoin, or music, or happenings in the world. I was pissed off the first night he didn't answer me. I was worried by the second night. I noticed that he hadn't been on FB in a while and that was not normal for him as he was ALWAYS on FB. My first thought was, ""hey, maybe they finally found a job!"" My brothers (who lived and worked together - they did literally every thing on Earth together) had been out of work since the very start of the pandemic, and had been trying to get back to it. I got to enjoy that thought for about a day. I realized the next day that there's no way they wouldn't have told me if they had gotten a job, and if they didn't tell me, surely my Mom would have. We were very invested in their health, recovery, and day-to-day lives. But still our guards were down. After like 15 years of true and honest to God chaos, we had finally let our guards down. I started to wonder if they were using, because they hadn't answered me or my Dad. I started to get very angry.

I suppose my parents must have also had a premonition, because on the morning of May 6, they decided to drive over to their apartment. The window to their 3rd story apartment was open, and they yelled and yelled up to it (we didn't have any other way of entering). My Dad told me that he already knew before they started yelling. They called the police, and sure enough, both of my brothers were located deceased in their beds in the apartment. Their bodies were badly decomposed as they had been lying there since April 27 - over a fucking week.

I will not try to describe to you what receiving that phone call was like. I was having a great morning at home - working, as I've been working at home since March 2020, doing some chit chat with my friends online. I booked my vaccine appointment for my boyfriend and I (which I had texted my Mom about earlier, when she was in the car on the way to the apartment). Then at about noon, my Dad called. Somehow I already knew what that call was going to be. But I will never, for the entire rest of my life get it out of my head,

""SurvivalistTales . . . 31 and 29 are dead.""

And here I am now on May 9, Mother's Day, the day we were all supposed to be together laughing and enjoying and celebrating our dear mother, with my life in utter fucking ruins, without the two people I love more than life itself. My parents suffering the most excruciating pain that a parent can know, and believe it or not, they have not lost 2 but now 3 sons in their lives. We had an older brother that died as a child to leukemia. Now they have lost all their sons. The worst thing a parent can ever endure has now struck again, as they lost two fucking more.

I won't go on and on about the unbearable pain, the insane loss of both my brothers, my family, and how I cannot imagine how I am going to live in this world without them. But I will go on about the following:

The medical examiner's provided us with interesting information about brother 31. He was found with a lighter in one hand, and a rolled up scratch ticket in the other. I am extremely innocent with regards to drugs, and I have no clue what that would have been, but we won't receive a toxicology report for at least 6 months, apparently. They said that he died instantly, because the autopsy revealed that he was actually already in the process of dying a slow death due to a severely enlarged heart. They said the enlarged heart was caused by extensive drug usage, likely cocaine. But I have since learned from his friends after his passing that he consumed all sorts of drugs I never imagined: meth, crack, cocaine, ketamine, GHB, heroin, and I have learned that he specifically sought out fentanyl. Our family was always led to believe that he was ""only addicted to heroin"" and I dunno, somehow that made it better. I won't be passing this extra information on to my parents. But the sad thing is, no matter if he had truly been clean, we were about to lose him anyway. The drugs had already ravished his body to such a point. His liver was also failing. He was not aware of either of these things.

The medical examiners would not provide us with details about brother 29's death. While they went into detail about 31, they were not so forthcoming with 29. I've received a couple of messages from their friends asking me whether or not they died simultaneously, or if 31 passed and 29 discovered his body and decided to take his own life. I think their intuition is correct. Their friends told me that the boys had a ""system"" for their drug usage, where one would watch the other consume their drug and wait before proceeding with using it themselves. Considering that 31 died instantly, I am unfortunately led to believe that this is likely the case. And if you knew these boys, you'd know that there was simply no way, no version of reality, in which one could live without the other. They were cosmically linked. I can live without them, as unimaginable as it sounds, but there's simply no way that they could live without each other. Sadly, our family doesn't get to hang on to the quiet comfort of knowing that they both passed at the same time. We now have to accept the possible horrible reality that 29 had to endure the worst imaginable pain, and had to decide to end his life instead of endure it. How fucking ridiculous. **Edit: for anyone in the future reading this: it has since been confirmed that 29 did not take his own life. I met with the police and they stated that they didn't provide details on 29 as it was "". . . very hard to identify him."" The police assured me that it was an accident, he did not take his life, and to put that narrative to rest. I am putting it to rest.""**

I am writing this because the pain is very fresh, and I feel fucking weird in this new world where I exist and my beloved, wonderful, blessed brothers do not. There is nothing that is ever going to make this okay. I feel rage, resentment, helpless, confused, and a sorrow that I could never have imagined. I can hardly even think about what my parents must feel. But I want you to know that it is NOT SAFE for you to consume these drugs. You may think you are safe after 2 years, but YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT DAMAGE YOUR BODY HAS ALREADY SUSTAINED. There is no safe way to do this. It is NOT worth it. Nothing on Earth will ever be worth it. Think of this family of 5 now widdled down to 3 and how we are supposed to exist for the whole rest of our broken lives. Is it worth it?

I won't claim to understand addiction. I have no fucking clue. I spent most of my life feeling resentful and at times even kind of scared of my brothers for their addiction. It just made no sense. We were a happy family and came from a prosperous, stable, supportive home. Our parents are fun and happy people who gave us a good life. We suffered no amount of dysfunction or abuse or like, anything bad. I'm so fucking innocent even at 33 years old - I've never even lost someone until now. But I assure you, I have now lost all remaining innocence, and I'd give literally anything to have it all back.

Don't do it. Don't do it. Please, don't do it. If you want reasons why not to, just imagine your mother and father on their knees on the floor screaming in pain. Imagine the police finding your 10 day old decaying body lying in your bed in your apartment with your dead brother who took his own life in the other room. Imagine your cat trapped in the apartment with you, for 10 days with her owners dead and likely without access to any food (imagine) or water. Imagine that your sister will never ever ever ever get her imagined versions of these images out of her head. Every time I close my eyes, I see it. I didn't even see it, and I am so thankful neither my parents and I did, but it doesn't mean it's not there in our imaginations.

If you or anyone here needs to talk or anything - message me. I am dedicating the rest of my life to addiction awareness and advocacy. I've learned now that my brothers were never clean of drugs. I don't know how I can ever forgive them.

The 6 or 7 years before that has been a messy alcohol and heroin fueled blur. Countless attempts at getting clean, sometimes cause I was being told I needed to, sometimes cause I was so sick of shoplifting and dealing and would do the whole cold turkey and then bam pay day, score again and of course many times was because I wanted to stop. But I've always messed up. 

The first few days were pretty horrible, standard. But after that it's like I wake up feeling surprisingly great then within about an hour I'm feeling like crap again (not as bad but still not great) and it takes me a day of smoking weed to get to where I feel kinda normal, usually by the evening time. Legs still ache but I don't feel so heavy and just generally horrible but then next morning same again? Seems to be getting easier each day which is awesome lol 



I'm 26 by the way, an (older) ex introduced me to heroin, it was great having sex ALL night, feeling all warm and cuddly together on it. Started dabbling again after we'd broken up cause I was bored and depressed and whatever other issues I've got , cause who doesn't ay? :D and so from there on it was the usual story of fucking everything up, jobs , home, relationships, homelessness, dealing, selling whatever you wanted from the shops for half price the whole shebang. 

Eventually got introduced to Subutex from a friend while I was deep into the worse cold turkey of my life , shaking in the bed almost seizure like and passing out, stand up to fast and end up fitting on the floor, I should probably note that for the past 3 maybe more years I've been an IV user of most Heroin but also Crack and Speed Like the squishy whitish yellowish  amphetamine goo you get all over Europe, meth isn't really a thing where I live, luckily enough. I was never really into benzos even though I had done them plenty of times but sadly, my brother died the 12th of this month, last year. He took a bunch of fake valium (really popular in my country unfortunately)  he went to sleep and didn't wake up. He was my best friend in the while world and I really really wanted to respect his memory by getting clean. And I did right after the funeral. But Id never ever heard of things like the ""pink cloud"" you all keep mentioning and the depression that comes after and what PAWS is, nevermind how long it can last. Didn't really understand Dopamine Addiction, or atleast I was oblivious to my own lifelong dopamine addiction. I grew up on playstation like so many others. But anyway so I passed the pink cloud phase and started feeling really crappy again and I really didn't understand it, didn't help I was grieving pretty hard at the time, but of course I start drinking a bit here and there and hey presto back on heroin back on the streets gah!!! 

But now thanks to r/OpiatesRecovery and YouTube I've learned why I'm still feeling crappy even after getting over the acute part, why I gotta be carefully when I'm high off life cause I could end up chasing a real high, the depression after that honeymoon period. How recovery actually takes a number of years, in cases like mine atleast and not just a case of getting past the withdrawal.

  It's like I've experience these things 200 times but didn't recognize them until actually learning about now. 

Being on here is giving me lots of tools and helping me mentally prepare from what's coming down the road. 

And because of all that along with the fact that Covid isn't really great for Meetings and I'm waiting to be appointed a drug worker. And to say thank you. I'd share a bit of my story and where I am now. Seemed like it'd help to get involved and hopefully maybe I might be able to help someone else out too :) 

So thanks for reading if you having any questions or advice I'd love to hear it :)

It wasn't any real high but took away the minor lingering symptoms but def even that little amount prolonged the detox period. Still feel like crap pretty much. Tolerable crap. 

I had a decent size habit and it's to be expected. Went cold turkey the day I moved in with my girl. She had found a bag of Kratom and read up what it was so I just said I quit n I'll have to pay a little by not feeling well. Problem is I like kratom but it's still just a crutch for me. Was going to go pick some up today but stopped myself. 

At the same time I had got caught basically nodded out on the side of the road with bags n a straw so caught a DUI, probation for a year, my mom is diagnosed with stage 4 lung, stomach, pancreas cancer. It's spread like wild fire and to boot I'm on unemployment but there's an issue for some reason.

Today marked my 14th day clean!

This group has helped me quit heroin in such a huge manner. I learned that it's normal to feel horribly and anxious the first week. Fortunately, I work out daily so the endorphins from weights and cardio had me in a positive mood even by day 4.

The first week was bad but week 2 has been nothing short of amazing. I'm in the pink cloud phase, and my counselor and I spoke about the dangers of being in such a positive mood. That's my homework for next session -- to find what my triggers are, and how I will avoid them in the future.

I need to go back and finish my undergraduate on Computer Science...but before that, I'm in desperate need of cash so I'll go to the first place that accepts me. Minimum wage? I'll take it. 

After months of proving to myself that I'm being stable, I'll either stop working or make it part-time and then go back to uni.

----------------

 I let heroin take everything from me. It's been a long and strenuous dance with my devil. Hell, just last year I spent more time with a needle in my arm than without. I've seen people shoot up and drop dead, and even more just barely make it back from an overdose. Through it all, I believed I was the anomaly. That I couldn't lose to it; lose my family, my life. I'm me, I'd think; still believing there was anything special about the Junkie I'd become. Even after my heart stopped twice I stayed the path headed further into nothingness. It didnt bother me that I was alive simply because Rachel thought to check on me while I had a cigarette. I used again less than an hour after the paramedics left. 

I truly no longer felt anything positive. There was no love or joy or laughter anymore. Sure, it was around, but it wasn't for me, and I knew it. I missed it but I buried those thoughts deep with every syringe I filled with poison. None of the pain left with my happiness though. No, the loneliness and depression and self depravity clung to me like a dark cloud that I couldn't wash off. Even in the brightest of days I still felt nothing but the hollowness inside of me and my existence. The worst part is, I knew all these years that this was all wrong, that I could be so much better than my addiction. Instead, I chose to put self-rationalized excuses in my veins because it was easier than facing a life without. 

What I craved the most was heroin, and with each dose slowly turning into a highway of scar tissue across my arms I could feel Rachel's stare from across the room. Her presence always made me detest what I was doing. What I was becoming. So in her absence, I sunk deeper. It became my obsession--part of my everyday routine. No other person would do what she could for me like she could: heal me from the inside out. There were times when she begged me with tears in her eyes to stop, but like autopilot switching on I avoided issue and without thinking about it would leave the house to take the easy route again. I would drive to a secluded area and remove the glove box, revealing my personal kit of despair, and prep another shot with as much broken glass mixed into brown sugar as possible and chase it down with some vanilla extract to sweeten myself for heroin's acidic taste that stained all that was good about who I had been once upon a time.

But I knew deep down I was testing how I felt about it. 

I've been so sick since my second vaccine and my symptoms have honestly been comparable to the opiate withdrawals I had when withdrawing from fentanyl and oxycontin. I know that sounds dramatic, but I've been shivering non-stop, fever of 101.1, feel like I've been hit by a truck, run over, then kicked and trampled. I've been vomiting non-stop. Sweating, insomnia. Hot flashes. RLS. I've been crying from the body aches/muscle pain. I have lupus, so I'm definitely having a worse than average response, so people shouldn't be scared to get their vaccine. 

It honestly feels similar to when I went into precipitated withdrawals from subs, AKA worst flu of my life x10 minus the sniffles or tearing up/sneezing. I'm crying as I type this, but I'm still so glad I got the vaccine. 

Now that I can recall just how terrible withdrawals felt, especially with underlying health issues.... I'm just SO grateful I didn't relapse. 

These side effects will be over soon. But Fentanyl withdrawals lasted WEEKS for me and I can't go through that again.

I always knew not to touch it due to my addictive personality & successfully turned it down all times before this one . At the end of the day it’s no ones fault but my own and I wish I could take it back but here we are 2 years later after being in and out of jail due to herion & on dec 22 2020 I got in a severe car accident & totaled my car . I died on the scene due to all my injuries , I broke both femurs , my right tibia broke , completely shattered my right wrist , had acute lung failure , level 4 spleen injury & bruised main artery & some broken ribs.

She told me she was helping a friend get some and she would get some for free so they would do it . At this time I was sober due to legal issues & just getting out of jail.  Fast forward to my car accident my little sister came and saw me in the hospital, she knows I relapsed and that’s what got me there , she’s seen me overdose before and watched me battle with this demon .

I have relapsed on herion a few times sense then but mainly just get pills of the street .  My addiction is back in full swing because one day I relapsed and got in a car accident that made me that much more opioid dependent. I use the pain in my legs as an excuse to stay on them but it’s taking all my money , & ruining my relationships. I don’t even wanna post this tbh it’s pretty embarrassing. Today I went to the Suboxone doctor & I’m attempting for the second time to get clean with Suboxone.  I came home & got pills because like I said earlier my little sister is now on them so now they’re just a call away .

I've been an addict since I was in my 20s. It wasn't necessarily addicted to one thing. Im just addicted to getting fucked up. Started out with weed then psychedelics, then slowly morphed in to just about anything I could get my hands on with the exception of meth. Over the last year I pretty much dove head first into opiates. Normally I would just be getting Vicodin or percocets. Then unfortunately the pressed m30s started coming around town, and I started getting those unknowingly. I finally found out the were pressies when I asked him like why are these so much stronger the a regular perc 30. I was livid but unfortunately it was too late. Last summer I went from using maybe 3 to 4 pervs a week to 3 to 4 pressies a day. I was doing anything I could to get high. When I started withdrawals by the time I woke up in the morning from crushing the night before I knew I had to do something. And I checked myself into outpatient treatment and graduated from out patient after 90 days clean. I felt good and I was on the right path..... Until my lung collapsed.

I started using the pressies again to manage my pain. It's freaking scares hell when it hurts to breathe and your lung feels like paper. I had to do something and my addict brain took over and I convinced myself that I can keep it under control this time and I won't go over board. That didn't happen. I've been on a bender for the last 3 months with using at least one a day. I lost one of my jobs due to the addiction. I've pawned almost all my stuff just to get a high. I spent all my money on them and now I can't pay my rent  pay my electric bill, phone bill internet, buy groceries, cigarettes pretty much anything. I feel like I've dug myself a huge hole that will be impossible to climb out of. I'm at a loss and I have no idea what to do. I'm absolutely terrified to go through bthe withdrawals again. I know there is stuff out there to help with it but I'm still terrified. One of the reasons why I haven't checked myself into treatment again is because I still owe them 4 grand, and cannot get services until that is paid. I just did my last half of a pressie tonight so I can get some sleep tonight, but tomorrow morning I HAVE to something. It feels like I have no way out and death will be the only release, even though I know it's not true. I need to call my mom.

2021-05-05 11:39:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/n5iuz2/sick_days/,Sick days,"I was just reflecting this morning on how many days I have spent sick in bed withdrawing, or unable to function because I was waiting on drugs or some dumbass that sold them. Or just the days where I could only do the bare minimum, when just showering felt like a monumental chore (I vividly remember being in so much pain that I would just sit on the floor in the shower unable to really stand anymore and let the hot water run on me, or how much dread I had getting out of the shower because my body had lost its ability to regulate temps and I would be wet, freezing, and have to get dressed). Days when I could barely handle conversation with other people because I just didn’t have much to offer and emotionally/physically I wasn’t there. I feel like I missed out on so much time. I guess when I reflect back I don’t really feel as bad about the time I wasted when I was actually high on drugs, more so the amount of time I spent obsessing over them, waiting in parking lots for late dealers, and probably the most understated aspect of drug addiction: recovery. Getting clean is a bitch of a time and towards the end it felt like I was losing a piece of myself each time I went through it and I guess that kind of is what ended up being my bottom was that I was just so sick and tired of being sick and tired ALL THE TIME.



The rinse and repeat cycle of addiction to clean to relapse to get clean again was just so exhausting. The insomnia the first few months, being hungry yet unable to stomach food, the shame and guilt of letting down friends and family again, feeling like a fish out of water those first few months of sobriety, like a true shell of myself. I was a shell of myself using and I was a shell of myself initially in sobriety, but at least sober I was able to work towards being less of a shell of myself. Gradually I was able to find things I loved doing again, enjoyed social interaction again, built healthy habits like working out and meditating. And now I feel stronger and better than ever. 



I guess the point of this post is that once you have a respectable amount of time clean, it is really easy for me to oversimplify things and kind of lose track of how hopeless and lost I felt at points during the entire process. Which is crazy because I know this is the tendency, yet I fall victim to it. Inside of this tendency I am also prone to looking at drug addiction and recovery separately which they were most definitely not. PAWS was always the hardest part for me because that was when I was the weakest, I had already gotten over acute WDs, and still would have a ton of shitty symptoms and not feel right and it would be a month or few months later and it just felt so much easier to stay on the path of less resistance and go back to what I knew. 



I guess what got me started down this tangent was I woke up at 4:30 this morning and was unable to get back to bed. This used to happen in early sobriety all the damn time, and it is such a weird time/feeling because no one else is awake, it’s too late to take a sleep med and try to salvage going back to sleep, it’s way too early to really make noise and go about your day, so you just kind of are stuck in this purgatory. You are too awake to sleep but still sort of groggy and out of it so you don’t really want to turn on the lights. It really serves as quite the metaphor for addiction and recovery for me, those moments where I didn’t think I could go on living clean or in addiction. Just kind of stuck bouncing between the two, biding time until my next run, kind of just going through the motions in both, unable to really bring myself to commit fully either way. 



I never really took the plunge in drug addiction. I was a heroin smoker, shot up a couple times but somehow had the foresight to know where that was headed I guess idk tbh it just never took, but I was always just kind of trying to manage, do enough to be high but not really have people notice (obviously some days better than others with this), save a little bit for later or the morning (once again varying degrees of success). But I guess my point is that I saw a lot of other people dive head first into the drug game, start selling, start shooting up, hanging out with fellow drug addicts all the time, etc. I was never like that. I had basically one guy I used with, one of my best friends, he dove in head first and OD’d by 23. The rest of that time was spent alone, no one to run with, just buy my shit and go use it by myself. That’s not to say I didn’t have friends, but once again you are kind of caught in between hiding your addiction and hanging out with friends that obviously wouldn’t want to be around that kind of shit (even unknowingly). So then you start to isolate, try to only hang out with people when I had control of the situation, I had picked up my drugs, showered, looked presentable, used enough but not too much. The problem with that is the drug game is unpredictable and I started having to flake on engagements because the conditions weren’t right, and I would isolate even more. Nobody likes to have plans cancelled on them. 


I went to rehab at 21 years old, back when I was just using oxy, it kind of ruined using for me from there on out because the lies I was telling myself had been exposed and there was obviously more going on than purely just chasing hedonistic desires. I was obviously fucked up internally and had developed horrible coping mechanisms. I had now also been exposed to true* hardcore addicts, I couldn’t keep lying to myself saying that would never be me, and I realized I had a lot more in common with them than I wanted to believe upon arrival. I was convinced that I was different, I was just using a pill, not shooting it like the junkies in the streets. The problem was that all the junkies in the streets started off the same way I did, had been where I was, and inevitably you use long enough and you are basically headed towards being a junkie on the street. I saw what I was doing to my loved ones, realized that I didn’t just like using drugs because they felt good, and knew where I was headed if I continued to use. I now knew that what I was doing was wrong, and I was headed down a very dangerous path, which was obviously not enough to impede the monkey on my back for more than a few months.


Unfortunately, as is the theme here, it was too early for sobriety also. I was far too immature, and although I had learned a lot in rehab I had not committed enough of it to conscious thought, and was still determined to be the lucky lotto winner that could manage to use like a gentleman. I (as is another theme) would go to meetings, get a sponsor, and put in a lot of time and work on recovery, but not enough to truly get anywhere meaningful. Even though I did some good work that was meaningful, I always had one foot out the door because I knew I wasn’t going to be completely sober and I had no intention to be. I just was going to be sober as long as I had to be to feel like I had tamed the monkey, usually about 3-6 months, and then I would return to drug and alcohol usage with the exception of opiates. 



It was from that point on that I was stuck in this limbo, a decade of on and off usage until opiate cessation about 2 1/2 years ago, where I would get anywhere from 3 months to even a year of clean time before I would relapse back into usage. But the cat was out of the bag already, at least for those closest to me, and they were no longer so easily convinced that I was doing fine, they knew the signs to look for now. So that even during my runs I would spend a lot of time trying to get clean, or thinking about how to get clean, which was ironic because when I was sober I was thinking about how I was gonna use. Truly stuck in limbo, a theme that if you made it this far you can tell it is the point of today’s reflection. All of this time was spent not knowing what I truly wanted, or maybe put more succinctly: not knowing what I wanted and how to get it. 


And if you’ve made it this far, and you are in early recovery or maybe just need an extra kick in the ass, know that this all could have been prevented. We all know that we can get back friendships, even relationships, finances, objects we have pawned, jobs lost, etc. but we will not get back that time. Not just the time spent in opiated bliss (for that is, after all, what we signed up for initially), but the nights we spent unable to sleep, the beautiful spring days where we couldn’t get out of bed, the hours upon hours waiting in shitty parking lots. The time spent lying down on the shower floor, or freezing in the fetal position with a towel, the countless hours just wasting time until I would be able to achieve my next high, distracting my brain from its obsessive pursuit of opiates, only momentarily of course. The half sick blues, purgatory, knowing that you were indeed going to get sweet relief but no clue as to WHEN. So I would distract my brain, scroll social media incessantly, checking r/opiates non-stop and reading all the stories, the anticipation of opiate bliss laid in the background of not knowing if “20 minutes” meant 20 minutes or 3 hours. Each relapse not knowing if it was gonna be 3 days or 20 years, or I suppose as so many have done before, pure darkness...



That time could have been spent doing so many better things, I admit I sometimes look at non-addicts like “what’s your fuckin excuse!?” But that time spent was a part of my process, which fortunately eventually turned into my progress, and I have suffered and put myself through way too much fucking shit to give it all away, whether that be through relapse or just merely taking it all for granted. Because in relation to where I was, any beautiful spring day where I’m not laying in bed sick is a good one.",101,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984239339828491}"

Transitioning from Heroin to subutex ( not suboxone ),"Ok so I was 13 years clean and relapsed in March 2020. I've tried about 5 or 6 times to get onto subbys, one time for a month then 3 weeks 12days and some in between. Relapsed each time sometimes down to my partner bringing gear into the house and others myself, well always my choice I know.
I last used heroin Sunday night/Monday morning was using around £35 a day I'd guess over half a G not actually sure what I'm getting weight wise for a 10er and tend to use different dealers, just whoever is on at the time. 
iv been getting about 5 possibly 6 hours before I'd start to withdraw, usual shit wake up runny eyes, sneezing, spewing up etc. 
I've not been IV using iv been smoking it mainly in a pipe sometimes foil.
So I  took a 2 mg subutex at 10 30am another 4mg at 11am then another 4mg an hour later by 2pm I felt like I'd had nothing at all, well not quite but I was experiencing aches and pains in my shoulders, arms, ankles knees and thrashing around some diarrhoea not sick though well not at that point anyway. Of all the swap overs I've been through this has been the hardest/ most painful.
So it's like 3 30pm on the Monday and my partner came over and said that the only thing that would stop the pain but I wouldn't get high was to use a very small amount of heroin, which I did, and yes it took the pain's in my joints away for around 2 hours then I did the same thing again at 5pm both times made sure the subbys were in my system before the heroin. 
Very unorthodox I'm sure but it seemed to work. I had a ruff night on the Monday/Tuesday morning then again put 8mg of subutex in me at 9am and more later then again had a little bit of a pipe yesterday afternoon then subbys since. The thing is I'm finding I have to take them every 4 hours and I'm taking upto 24mg a day. I'm only I prescribed 10mg and have no chance of an increase only to espranor but that's a different story.
So I'm 3 days into trying to get on the subbys why am I having to take it every 4 hours and when will I start to feel better.
Please be kind and keep thing's simple as I've some brain problems from my past years of using phet paste iv.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.994155764579773}"

However, I'm really struggling with various things and don't know what to do. I cannot go back to my life using dhc for the sake of my finances, my parents, my feelings of self respect and self worth, for my own well being and future, and because I just want to feel normal. Even if I wanted to go back to using which deep down I really don't, it's not really an option anyway due to the decrease in availability obtaining them and the increase in price. 

I am currently over the worst of the physical withdrawals but it's hard to explain, my body just doesn't feel right and really uncomfortable. I feel agitated, my legs feel horrible (not rls just uncomfortable and tingly), like they need the dhc to feel normal and relaxed again, I feel unsettled and down in the dumps with a massive lack of enjoyment in things I use to love whilst using dhc, along with an inability to focus. I also have literally no motivation or energy to do anything. Add all of these things to a lack of sleep with intense cravings and you can see how hard of a struggle it is. 

The thing is, deep down I know I need to keep going and not give in, and therefore continue suffering, however it's so hard and it seems to be getting harder and harder. I am exercising each day and start back at work in a week. In a way I feel trapped. Going to doctor isn't an option tbh. What's making me really concerned and pessimistic is that I keep reading personal accounts from people who say they suffer for months and end up giving in anyway as they don't feel better!

I can sleep easily, and just have tiny episodes of the physical effects of withdrawals, especially when I'm not busy and in my mind. Other than that, I feel good. But I've been doing quite a bit of research about the whole process of recovery, and things that I have read aren't really sunshine.

In my mind, I've only been experimenting with it. I'm in lockdown for some time now, and Oxy filled a huge hole. I've had this whole plan in mind that I would only use them during the lockdown period, to relax and step away from it all, but it turned into a kind of an habit. I have been aware of the consequences of opiate abuse, but it takes for a person to experience it to fully understand it I guess.

I haven't been on it for the entirety of the five months, I had off days, and three weeks in the middle of my ""journey"". In the beginning I've only used them at the weekends, or on occasion and shared it with my friends; but by the end it, became an every night thing. By the last days, I could feel that I was withdrawing from it when I woke up, so I started to take it a few hours after waking up. Then I realized what I had done, and decided to taper off  with some of the capsules left, and quit for good. And now we're here.

The thing that concerns me most is that, since I'm in the beginning of my quitting process; I know relatively little about things to come, and the past few days haven't really given me much positive thoughts about the future, to be honest.

Since experience vastly differs from person to person, from duration to duration, and from substance to substance, I'm afraid. Some of the posts I've read say that the anxiety never goes away, some say that you always feel terrible all the time, and you just have to live with it; and addiction sort of defines you, that you just have to best it one day at a time, throughout your life etc.

Damn, I just want to know if I've done something terrible for myself for the sake of my curiousity.

I wanna know what I'll be dealing with in the coming days, and months, and years, basically. 

But deep down I just want to be comforted that I didn't go off far; that 5 months isn't a long time for abuse, and I will be just a-ok. That will do too, I guess.

I realised what a sick mechanism heroin operated on; sure perhaps the first couple times it elevates you and you feel great, but from then on, even if you're not physically dependent, it still affects you such that you feel like shit without it.

Although I was an addict, I am a functional self employed person who brings in an average of 3-7k a month. I would have travelled to detox but due to covid I hid out at a 5 star hotel for 5 days-- I figured that the luxurious environment might quell any anxiety or negative feelings that might arise.

By day 4, I felt a lot better. Initially, anhedonia and serious chills/goosebumps/cold sweat although I live in a tropical, humid climate were the most evident symptoms. On day 6, a friend gave me a tiny bit of local h. 

Personally, I feel that the h from where I'm from is gross and many levels beneath the afghan and turkish stuff you score from the deep web. It's nowhere as potent, and often leaves a powdery residue on my tongue. Doesn't taste as vinegary or herbal/sweet either.

Got mild effects from the tiny bit of h, finished it and don't feel the urge to smoke more. I know there's residue in my drawer upstairs; normally at this stage I'm fiendish and scouring my house for residue in foil pipes, but rn I just feel like tossing it.

In the days that followed up till now, I wake up anxious and suddenly have a gigantic appetite as though I just want to eat everything?? Does anyone know if these are normal and linked to recovery or perhaps they're standalone and unrelated.

I am also wondering about my tendency to go back. At this point it doesn't feel too strong since I express disinterest in the h produced here, but i can't say the same if I were to get my hands on some afghan. I wonder if it is possible to smoke recreationally since its not often that I find afghan h here anyway.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9958916902542114}"

I tried eating better. I tried therapy/CBT. I tried giving myself more clean time. Creating a schedule to distract myself. Nothing helped.

Nothing I did made me happy or gave me a feeling of pleasure. I was uninterested. I cried every day.

And after coming clean to my girlfriend felt was the time to come clean to them as well, and that has helped me so much mentally that I can already see better days ahead. 

I haven’t used kratom, Xanax or anything even since 11:40 Thursday night, which was when I crushed my last half and sniffed it away. Friday and Saturday weren’t too well, but it’s almost the end of Sunday now and well, I feel OK. I have stomach problems as well as restless legs, the issues sleeping, hot and cold flashes, but I’m smiling at them all and keeping positive. 

Coming clean helped me when I was at my breaking point mentally and emotionally a week ago, I am now scheduled with a therapist for Wednesday and already planning ahead. Plus I’m starting to be able to eat real food and not squirt it out an hour later. Call it 2 days 20 hours whatever you want. I’m calling it 3 days and not looking back. I’m even denying myself kratom.  
I’ll still be here over the next little while, But with more of a voice and less of a secret, hoping posting here keeps my mentality.

I’ve managed to taper my h doses to once or twice a day and no more than .3 maybe .4 (smoking only) I have my amazing girl supporting me and I have given her the rest of everything I have, she and my mom are in control of what I have, and I told them not to give me anything if possible, so the last time I took any opiate was 3 am this morning (2 oxy 10mg) just to help me sleep. I’ve been struggling with quiting for the past few weeks now (oxy 100-150mg a day mostly and just recently 6 months of h ((covid made everything so much worse for the manic depressed addict in me)) and I’m ready to be sober or at the very least just a stoner again) 

my question is what can I do to survive the physical withdrawals? Currently I have gabapentin, Xanax, weed, Imodium, and I think about 20grams of kratom (20 capsules that scaled out to about .5 each) 

I was able to get through the first day with Imodium Xanax and gabapentin by sleeping most of the day, but weed would just make my anxiety worse 75% of the time, not like it use too when I was younger.

I want to be able to get passed the physical problems without prolonging them. I currently have from now til Thursday evening before I go back to work. I’m worried kratom and possibly the Imodium might make it prolong the physical withdrawals.

I don’t doubt the paws will be difficult but with my mom and girlfriend supporting me and my determination to get off opiates along with a new job possibly coming up I’ll have my time and mind occupied.

Should I be taking kratom and Imodium to help me get past this? I don’t know if I can do it without the Imodium but I managed the first day without any kratom ( of course I caved at 24hrs as I was saying)

I decided to go and tell another family member who lives about an hour away from where i’m from about my situation and just because i needed some type of support and they were more than welcoming and had brought up the idea f staying over there for a couple days to get out of where i live. i thought it would be best for me to just go there for the next 3-4 days and deal with it. I honestly remained pretty busy yesterday and so i really didn’t experience much discomfort. Surprisingly i did end up getting some sleep which i thought was crazy because i’ve read stories on this page about people going days without sleeping. To take the edge off last night though i did end up drinking some beers and getting buzzed. I’m not a big alcohol fan but the family member im staying with even told me to try a few drinks and see how i feel. The drinks made my night manageable. After stopping drinking around 12 i just watched some netflix until i felt it was ready to try and sleep. I also ended up taking some trazadone of course so it’s not like i fell asleep all naturally. The first time i fell asleep it was only for about half an hour but i decided to take half of the trazadone again which then knocked me out for a good 3 and half hours. After i woke up from that i had a splitting headache which i took some tylenol and took a dab to which both did help out. After coming down from the dab i had fallen back asleep for another good hour or so. For my symptoms though, besides my energy levels being pretty low right now to where i just wanna lay around but besides that and the headache i really almost feel fine. I do have a little bit of restless leg but it’s honestly pretty manageable.

Mornings are the worst and I wake up all sweaty with a feeling of dread in my stomach. It gets a little better as the day goes on and I’m usually busy all day at work but as soon as I stop and have time to think then the anxiety hits me like a fucking truck again. I’ve still got physical symptoms going on as well, so I’m either freezing cold or boiling hot. Luckily I work in construction so it just looks like I’ve been working really hard if I’m sweating like an idiot. I dunno what I’d do if I worked in a job where I needed to look presentable.

Most of the time I feel like I’m a robot. I get up, go to work, come home, go to bed then repeat. My head feels like there’s so much going on inside it that it’s all just noise now. I haven’t got the brain bandwidth for anything pleasurable. I’m supposed to be playing football with my mates tomorrow but I can’t even face doing that and I used to really look forward to going to 5 a side and I also played rugby as well (before the pandemic).

I’m lucky in that my job is physically demanding so I’m usually so tired at the end of the day that I can just go straight to bed after I’ve eaten. There’s been a few nights where I’ve woken up sat on the couch still in my work gear and boots with my tea still on my lap, lol.

Anyway, the reason I feel like I’ve failed is that I ended up ordering some subutex from the onion fields because I’m just done. I can’t deal with this fucking PAWS any longer. I genuinely don’t want to get high but I need to feel well again. That’s why I chose subs because they’ve never got me high, just made me feel not sick.

This time I’m trying it without subox.

The first four days were absolutely indescribable as many of you can probably imagine. 

But it’s 2 weeks later and I am still going through  what feels like withdrawals. Here comes the list of symptoms.

Hot and cold flashes like crazy. I never feel the right temperature and am constantly getting waves of sweat that just pour out of me. If you haven’t experienced this it’s really the worst feeling.

Extreme fatigue. I get winded and light-headed just from standing up.

Aside from the expected depression and anxiety, those are the two most extreme symptoms that are making life unlivable at the moment. 

Sidenote: I do take .5mg of alprazolam at night, unprescribed, because I can’t even get an rx for trazodone from my dr because of my history. So I don’t know what else I can obtain that will help with sleep. I am being as careful as I can with this.

Has anyone dealt with these symptoms so far out when going cold turkey? I don’t have the energy to find a new pcp and see them but is that potentially worth it? Could it be more than PAWS? And if it is, how long does it last? I know these are questions for a dr, but wanted some experienced opinions I suppose.

I really hope this doesn’t last much longer because I can’t live this way, but I also can’t go back to opiates.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980996251106262}"

Have you just went through a long lasting detox, possibly from multiple drugs. Alcohol maybe? If so then your guts have not been circulating proper for a while. You may feel somewhat grumpy/slouchy just general negativity.

Try a gallbladder flush, plenty of guides online. Particularly for heroin addicts it is not uncommon to develop gallstones (fairly quickly, just a few years can do), which in western medicine are only treatable by surgery once later in life.

However there is many ayuvurdic techniques used to flush the body, consisting of apple juice, olive oil, enema and certain resting positions.

I never thought I had gallstones, in a effort last year I tried a flush. I passed about 20-50 little pellets.

I felt a noticeable decrease in lethargy and increase in energy and general mood.

I continued drinking and I am contemplating another, it is one of those things many countries do as standard first line treatment. Given the nature of the procedure it is kept to mostly a mid/late life surgery in western country's. I hope my early intervention may prevent that.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9960728883743286}"

I’m an opiate and benzo addict/alcoholic. I have been using/drinking on and off for about 16 years now and it’s been a long road. I was able to put together 5 years at one point but went back out and my late twenties have been extremely tough. I have my first honest 33 days in 3 years. I am burnt and feel like I had some sort of emotional snapping point this last run. I went up into the woods and put myself into precipitated withdrawals by taking 16mg of suboxone at 24hours on purpose, no comfort meds and felt the pain. It was the most hellish detox I have been through but I believe that I needed it to be that way. 

Unfortunately, my life was so intertwined with active users that I am still trying to unwind it. I have a lease to break, a phone bill to split off of and need to grab my things from my old house where my roommate is a serious meth addict and has slipped into essential insanity. 

Regardless of all this I have stayed clean and kept my head pointed in the right direction for myself and for my fiancé, who is the love of my life and the best woman I have ever met. We both got sober around the same time, and detoxed separately then reunited after about 2 weeks. 

Her life has been difficult/traumatic and she has a brain tumor that could essentially rear its head at any time but we are unable to do any type of treatment until she turns 30, without risking permanent damage to the rest of her brain. She has suffered with this tumor since she was 3 years old and has sort of had a death wish/lack of care for life because she never believed she would live to see age 30 until we met. 

She has picked up heroin the last 2 days and I do not know what to do. I am a certified welder and just landed a good/high paying job for the first time in years, and have been taking steps to get us into a new environment, till we can leave our state and start over somewhere else. But I cannot do it alone, and I know that I cannot change her or get her sober, she has to want it and take the steps necessary to stay sober. I don’t want to leave her, I know she isn’t maliciously using, she’s just doing what we all do when we are fucking up. 

My emotional cup is full and I need to make sure I am okay, otherwise I could go back out and I’ll be useless to myself and my fiancé, but I cannot give up on her/walk away. I am a true empath with her and it is extremely difficult to have to have tough love/stick to my guns because I am so scared of watching her destroy herself. I know that I can call her mother or her sister, both of whom I am on good terms with and in contact with daily, but they are at their tipping point with her use and they will be out her life permanently if they find out she used again, or at least that’s what they have said, and it would destroy her. 

I know deep down we are all good hearted people, we just have a disease and so does she. But I truly do not know what to do. The pain of walking away is just as painful as watching her use. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much.

Much love too everyone.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978912472724915}"

I just sniffed five 8mg Dillies after a 3 days tolerance break. I’ve heard that these are fake and are actually isotonitzine. 
I recently lost everything but I don’t even care because I have the most deepest passionate loving warm blanket to cuddle me that is opiates. 
I never seem to have very bad physical withdrawals but the mental side is anguish. The anhedonia is all too real I can’t enjoy a single thing in life. 
I don’t want MAT of any kind I just want to be free from this insanity. 
Tomorrow I’m waking up and calling the recovery Center. I promised mom and dad I can do this at home no problem but I just went under their noses while they were asleep and had the plug drop off 20 little bastards to me for another $380. 
I used to have $40,000 saved up since last summer and now I have $700. Part of me does not even mind spending that remaining $700 on another score at least I’ll feel happy or sumshit. 
I don’t want to break mom’s heart again so I’m going to lie and say “I DID try to relapse but I got scammed and didn’t have anything” they’ll probably see right through that and kick me out again but please pray for me or wish me luck or whatever. When this stash runs out I’m going to try again.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974990487098694}"
