I went straight to a friend of mine and in the evening i started to feel alot of cramping in my legs, the next day i tried to fraunticly call everywhere just to get some clonidine but to no avail, i ended up taking H again, the seroquel made me super depressed and i was on some sort of suicide mission, i didn’t give a shit about paying my rent which ive never done before in the past, after two whole weeks did i realize that the medication made me this way and i quit right away. 

I have applied for rehab but it takes months before i can start which is killing me, had to start on subuxone again but i only agreed to 4mgs and nothing more than that since its a temp solution,  but its still better than H.

At the clinic, I was told its three shots in your stomach, extended release buprenorphine, and ultimately lasts a year. Also, that you don't have to wait so many days as with vivitrol, and get precipitated withdrawal because of it; but that you can begin injections immediately after detoxing (even earlier I would assume, but I prefer to get through the pain before medication to keep me off). Now my friends' experience and information clashes. It makes you sick, doesnt last a year, and some other points I honestly forget. On top of that, I googled info about sublocade and even THAT contradicts the pamphlet and info from the doc at the sub clinic. It suggests its monthly just like vivitrol, and that you can get withdrawal from it when you finally stop your doses. Now, theres so many more things I could go on about with this and my curiosity, but I feel I've dropped enough to ask for some answers from you guys. So; what do you all know/think/experienced/etc..? I need to get clean asap, and if the clinic was right and it lasts a year - I've never made it quite to 6 months - I'm confident a year under my belt, free from the slavery of heroin, that I'd have a good chance to continue living dope free and progressing through my life in a positive way.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9906111359596252}"

I felt that I wasnt really doing anything productive in the program and I didnt feel like I was actually clean. I know some people need subs and consider themselves clean on them and that's totally fine, I'm just not one of those people.

So all i would think about in here during all the groups and meetings and everything is that i must get off this and give myself a real shot at true sobriety.  I'm in the perfect place for it because I have no responsibilities and tons of support which I am blessed to have. So It just hit me yesterday that I'm going to hop off and the 2mg dose at 6 p.m. last night would be it.

It's been over 24 hours now and to be totally honest I am feeling alright still. I know they say sub withdrawals dont kick in for like 3 days but i am one of those people with an extremely fast metabolism and i usually start to feel some symptoms  few hours before I'm due to take my sub. 

At the moment my symptoms are fatigue and lethargy, I cant stop peeing but that's also cause I'm chugging water like a mad man, I dont have the runs but I am going to the bathroom more, I occasionally yawn but only when I'm not doing anything and just lying around. Other then that I havent got a hot flash or the sneezes or cold sweats or any of that. It's weird cause I have been expecting it all to hit and it hasnt. 

I guess the point of this post is to hear from others that have gone through it and to hear what I should be expecting. Is it going to be worse or not? Most of all I'm just looking for support because like I said I'm in a rehab and at times I get depressed in here cause I cant be out and around my family and girlfriend and all that. But I know I need to be here. I also have a court case and am facing 3 years flat in prison and have already violated 5 times. I really dont have any more chances so leaving isnt even a thought  but I still get upset.

2019-12-28 06:13:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/egpng4/experiencing_the_symptoms_of_paws_is_an/,Experiencing the symptoms of PAWS is an opportunity to practice walking through pain without picking up a substance to change the negative feelings.,"

Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndome (PAWS)


PAWS may be a condition with a cute acronym, but its symptoms are really ugly. Let’s set the scene. You’re a month or two or nine months  into recovery, feeling better and starting to learn how to live sober. Out of nowhere, you start feeling different. Nothing horrible, just a little off, so to speak.

But the next day, it gets worse. Social situations become difficult to navigate. The work environment seems extra stressful. Sleep is evasive at best, and you have trouble with cognitive tasks. You may also find yourself daydreaming about executing a fatal judo-chop to the guy who gave you a “funny look.” 


Welcome to post-acute withdrawal syndrome.

Roughly 90% of those addicted to opiates long term, like heroin or prescription pain medication, experience this uncomfortable condition. It affects virtually everyone who gets sober from substance abuse at some point. And it might be the most underestimated cause relapse.

 Some common symptoms of PAWS include

• Dysphoria 
• Mood swings or anhedonia
• Sleep disorders
• Anger
• Lethargy or chronic fatigue
• Depression
• Anxiety or panic
• Inability to concentrate

While the above list is formidable, most people do not experience all the symptoms on the list (or all of them at once). Also, the human body is strong and resilient; with continued abstinence, the recovering person can be confident that his or her body and mind are repairing the damage. The above problems will come and go, and the symptoms will decrease in strength and duration as the body continues to repair itself and heal.

Dysphoria 

The opposite of euphoria. A fancy word to describe the feeling of basically want to jump out of your own skin. 

Anger / Irritability

As in deep unfounded resovoirs of endless raging anger for no reason at all. The kind of anger that rages subtly like a small flame that even the slightest unexpected  event outside of your control will set ablaze into a blistering inferno of ""fire and fury"" !

Depression

Like serious everyday is dark and gloomy when will I feel better -holy shit -wtf -depression.

Insomnia

Insomnia doesn’t necessarily mean you are experiencing post-acute withdrawal, but it is often a tell-tale sign. You may notice your sleep cycle disturbed. You may endure nights of extremely restless sleep. Vivid dreams, often involving the use of alcohol and drugs, may also occur during this time.

In severe cases, you may go days without sleep despite months of sobriety. Stressful situations often trigger these episodes.

When I experienced bouts of PAWS, there were times where I had no sleep. This usually lasted one day, but sometimes it continued into the next day. There were also times where I’d have trouble going to sleep, and times where I’d wake up too early. I endured just about every form of insomnia possible. In almost every situation, stressful life circumstances brought about the sleeplessness.

Anxiety

Anxiety and insomnia seemed to be two sides of the same coin. The less I slept, the more anxious I was. The more I slept, the less anxious I was.

Worry and fear clouded my mental climate in early sobriety. I think everyone, to some extent, deals with anxiety when they get sober. But I feel opiate addicts, in particular, battle the soul-wrenching tension more so than substance abusers of different varieties.

Early on, anxiety intruded on almost all circumstances. I felt like the Tin Man with no oil when I was in a room full of people I barely knew. 


Heightened levels of stress and/or increased sensitivity to stress

Stress was never something I’d handled well. My mind amplified situations that shouldn’t have been that big of a deal. First, I’d never developed ways to take care of myself. Second, my mind invented fairytale perspectives, specifically relating to social situations. Third, I never learned how to say “no.” I often pushed myself to the breaking point, piling on responsibilities to an overwhelmed schedule.


Trouble with cognition/thinking

It was equally disturbing when I realized how simple the answer was to certain problems. Sometimes, my job required me to do simple math. 15+18 presented a mental challenge only Texas Instruments could solve.


Trouble with emotions (overreaction or little/no emotion)


There were also times where I felt incapable of producing a single emotion – total emptiness. It went as far as me giving names to my emotions when they surfaced and feeling incredibly insightful that I had reached such a level of maturity.

Trouble in social settings

Granted, there wasn’t much social exercise occurring in the using of heroin and other drugs. My social skills were never that sharp anyway, and years of drug abuse really rounded this out.


THE BEST DEFENSES AGAINST PAWS

Meditation

I believe With some good direction, you can begin to calm your mind.

Regular sleep schedule

This is fairly self-explanatory and really just entails consistent discipline. I feel like there are three critical elements in cultivation of healthy sleep habits.

The first element is diet. I can’t sleep when I’m hungry.

The second element is target time. Set a window of time, say 10pm to 11pm.


Sober friendships

It’s time to say goodbye to all those terrific people with whom you drank and did drugs. If you truly want to stay sober, you must shut the door on the “old playmates.” 

Sober friendships add a layer of accountability to your program and provide people with whom you can confide in times of need. You must lean on these people when PAWS cycles start. Talk to them about how you’re feeling. Ask for direction and support.

Exercise

Exercise helps your body heal faster and may shorten the amount of time spent experiencing post-acute withdrawal.

Even something as simple as a 20 minute walk can do wonders for your mood.

Diet

It’s a good idea to keep caffeine to a minimum. These days, I’m a one or two cup guy. 

Sugar should be treated in like fashion. A candy bar here and there isn’t going to kill you.

I’ve found on days I keep my meals restricted to eggs, chicken, oatmeal, fruits and vegetables, I feel fantastic.  Like recovery, however, it doesn’t take much to throw me off the beam.

Recovery 

Have a healthy, active relationship with your sponsor will shield you from a potential relapse due to PAWS. He or she is someone you can talk with confidentially and honestly. An authentic line of communication can go a long way in calming the unwelcome side effects of your body’s readjustment period.

Healing is a slow process, but there are things the recovering addict can do to help. It’s good to remember to be very kind to your body, mind and spirit. Get plenty of rest, eat well, and exercise. 
Take time to make nutritious meals, exercise, cultivate a clean living space and fellowship with friends. By finding time to unwind, you will help decrease the severity and frequency of post acute withdrawal symptoms. Form friendships with others in recovery and with people who are trying to live healthy. Take every opportunity to have fun. Laughter is a great healer, and especially when things are frustrating, it helps to laugh at oneself; this is possible with the knowledge that things are going to get better.

Above all, do not go back to using. Experiencing the symptoms of PAWS is an opportunity to practice walking through pain without picking up a substance to change the negative feelings.

One feeling you can cultivate to combat despair and the temptation to use is gratitude. It is really hard to ingest a harmful poison when you’re full of gratitude. It’s possible to be grateful for each experience, even pain. Allowing oneself to experience pain without doing something to change the feeling engenders strength and growth.

How long will this last? There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. You can expect to feel progressively better the longer you abstain from your substance(s), but there can be days that you’re feeling depressed or anxious for no apparent reason. Just remember that this is normal and that it will end.

I’m going to try to mostly go to NA and CA meeting because I know those guys will be more understanding. The problem is that there are way more AA meetings available in my area than NA/CA. I am going to meetings to hopefully find a sponsor and don’t feel like some of the people in AA will like me/want to sponsor me because of my meth face.

Been doing black/clear/blues (press) for nearly 10 years straight.  Haven't gone to jail knock on wood.  I've never wanted for money (not balling outrageous, but my habit is not a problem).  With the new year coming and soon to be going like the last 10, I have been seriously considering since about October last year about quitting.  The anniversary of my ""contemplation"" of quitting came and went and I began to think; when your ""seriously considering quitting"" thinking is having anniversaries, something may be wrong.  Now my life is pretty damn good in comparison to what others I know live like; but I've run into people I knew years back and they either do the avoid thing or tell you to take care of yourself and then depart after some quick chat or don't even recognize you.  My mental block usually comes from the whole thought process of ""all of these fiends I know have been to jail/prison/had bad shit happen to them, live on the streets ect. and they STILL come back for more; I've got no shot"".  I recently turned 30, no longer in my 20s.  Can no longer say I'm just fucking around because im still in my 20s.

I said I never wanted for money because my habit is taken care of and while this is true, I have had to make sacrifices to continue to use.  The kind of sacrifices that I feel if I become sober and meet new people, telling stories about our pasts, they could only think of me as an imbecile.

My motivation for quitting is financial and lifestyle.  I just don't want to live like this anymore and want to be doing the things I used to do.  I'm not going to go into what I do for a living because a lot of people in my world are lowkey addicts and should one come across this, put 2+2 together (a little hint, those of you that understand that reference, maybe we have even met and copped together if you were local).  I used to travel the US following the main series of events for the sideshows.

A lot of fiends feel as if the time they spent doping was a waste.  I don't feel that way because when high I spent a lot of time thinking and improving professionally.  So I believe myself to be ahead of where I was say maybe 8 years ago; but I am with a different crowd right now, and haven't been able to verify (for that I need to stop spending all my cash which is my principal motivation).

I was going to wait for the 1st to quit cold turkey for my new years resolution but decided if I am going to quit on the first, then may as well start now.  If I am unwilling to quit now, then I will likely not commit on the first.  So I just finished the last of my last and was feeling pretty good and strong; so decided to post this.  Mostly to make myself commit.

I will come back at the end of January and post an update; if I don't come back, then I was not successful.  If anyone has anything of value to say ill be checking back every so often.  I know im not the only one making the attempt to leave our fiendish ways in this decade; so to everyone making the jump with me over the next few days, good luck and I hope we all succeed.  This is my first attempt at sobriety, so wish me luck.  When I sober up in the morning ill probably end up deleting this lol.  Peace.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976213574409485}"

A Primer on Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome

There are two stages of withdrawal that every addict in recovery will have to go through before they can truly move beyond their dependency on drugs or alcohol. First comes the acute stage, which will begin as soon as an addict stops using and will continue for several weeks after that. During this period of time, the physical cravings that the addict experiences will be intense and persistent, as the body has not yet adjusted to the loss of the drug it had relied on for so long. In this stage of withdrawal, the desire for chemical relief from the pain may be so overwhelming that addicts will feel like they are dying, and most former substance abusers will tell people later that this stage of their recovery was the hardest thing they ever had to go through in their lives. But unfortunately, this is not the end of the story. Addicts must pay a high price for their long history of usage, and it will actually take up to two full years before their neurochemistry finally returns to something resembling a normal state. After the acute stage of withdrawal ends, the post-acute stage begins, and the raft of troubling symptoms that those in recovery will experience during this nearly 20 month plus period of time have been labeled Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, or PAWS for short.

Defining PAWS

While the physical cravings associated with chemical addiction will start to abate after the first few weeks, drug and alcohol abuse cause more than just a simple physical dependency. It is during the post-acute stage of addiction that emotional and psychological symptoms of withdrawal begin to emerge and become dominant, taking recovering addicts on a roller coaster ride through a full range of thoughts, feelings, and reactions. While individual experience varies, some of the most commonly reported manifestations of PAWS include:

Attacks of anxiety

 Irritability 

Sudden mood swings

 Fatigue

 Lack of motivation

 Insomnia 

Inability to concentrate

 Obsessive thoughts 

Fluctuating energy levels

 Memory loss 

Difficulty in solving problems and thinking clearly

 Depression

These states and conditions will come and go throughout the duration of the post-acute stage, and they generally strike without warning. In the early days of PAWS, emotional and psychological turmoil is the norm, as the ups and downs come and go so quickly that recovering addicts will feel like their lives are careening out of control. Recovering addicts will experience alternating periods of dysfunction and near-normality throughout the post-acute stage, with the only change being that as time passes the duration of the good times will begin to increase. This is the result of the brain slowly re-organizing and re-balancing itself, and even though the negative effects associated with PAWS will remain a part of the equation for quite some time addicts should take heart in knowing that eventually those comforting feelings of normalcy and stability will transition into a full-time state of being. The symptoms of PAWS are the equivalent of a ghost that haunts the soul of the recovering addict, reminding him or her over and over again of the damage they did to themselves by abusing chemical intoxicants for so long. Thankfully, over time the relentless voices of those persistent spirits will begin to fade away, until there is nothing left of them but a barely audible whisper. But if they expect to reach that final destination of sobriety, the suffering associated with PAWS is a toll that all passengers who have taken the ride of substance abuse will have to pay.

Learning to Cope with PAWS

Despite the intensity of the cravings in the acute stage, many addicts are able to resist them, only to relapse later during the post-acute stage. This is because substance abusers are often well-prepared for the strong physical symptoms that accompany abstinence, but they are not ready at all for the scary and unfamiliar emotions they are suddenly forced to deal with after the onset of PAWS. That is why knowledge is the most important defense an addict can have against PAWS; as long as they know what to expect, they will not be taken by surprise when the various manifestations of the post-substance abuse blues descend upon them. When dealing with bouts of PAWS, recovering addicts should remain calm and relaxed, realizing that this too shall pass and that all of their inner turbulence is just a natural and unavoidable consequence of getting clean and sober. The best strategy for coping with the negative emotions and loss of focus and motivation associated with PAWS is to scale things down and to simplify. Outside of work, days and nights should be filled with small activities that bring pleasure, such as playing sports or games, exercising, reading, taking nature walks, journal writing, pursuing favorite hobbies, and so on. Generally anything that does not involve too much time or effort is acceptable; however, it is not a good idea to while away the hours by surfing idly on the internet or by vegging out in front of the television, since passive, unfocused pursuits like these can actually reinforce a negative mindset and end up making a person feel worse rather than better. Activities that require real effort and concentration in manageable doses, which is what recovering addicts dealing with the symptoms of PAWS should be looking for. Another thing that has worked for many is a change in diet that replaces the typical junk food and processed fare with plentiful helpings of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and lentils, brown rice, lean meats, etc. Healthy foods are the building blocks of a healthy body, and there is every reason to believe that improving the nutritional quality of the things we consume can help a damaged brain restore itself to proper working order much more quickly. Avoiding substances like caffeine and refined sugar is also important to recovering addicts, since these products cause spikes in energy levels followed by crashes, which recreates the effects of drugs and alcohol in a milder form and could ultimately trigger dangerous new cravings for something stronger. More than anything, recovering addicts taking the long march through the post-acute stage of withdrawal need the support of their counselors and their peers. Appointments with therapists should be made regularly and kept, support group meetings should be attended religiously, and no one who goes to either should be reluctant to share a single detail about what they have been feeling and experiencing with PAWS. The kind of advice, encouragement, and understanding that recovering addicts will receive from support groups and in counseling sessions during this time will be invaluable, and the odds of surviving this difficult and taxing stage of recovery will be improved exponentially for those who are smart enough to take advantage of these priceless resources.",30,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9891276955604553}"

I'll say thank you ahead of time and also I'll preface I'm not unfamiliar with the whole process due to friends, but this is the first time it has been like this - I know its her who has to want out. So my girlfriend of several years fell off the wagon 6 months ago and went MIA in the neighborhood where everyone cops in a specific town. This is the first time it ever got this bad. Life has not been kind and she's in a bad way. We all thought the cold would have her tap out because she was homeless at first and living in bandos. However, she hasn't, because it's been 6 months she's had time to make buds in the game and prolly has some places to crash. 

The area is rough. On many aves/blocks, if you aren't a local or buying the lookouts or dealers themselves will have you 86'd off the block.

We were incredibly close to eachother. She has a child that needs her (this has been brought up by others but hasn't worked). She doesn't have a phone or anything. 

Other family members and volunteers have tried, but I don't think they saying the best things to reach into her. As some of you know the idea of detox or just getting approached by people you don't want to face while using makes people shifty/paranoid/panicky. 

I've had a lot of advice from other friends who went through the same situation, but I'm trying to cast a wider net of ideas and things to say or not to say. Generally in this area, once someone gets sucked into it, they don't leave unless they are arrested, OD and choose to go into recovery, get hospitalized from a beating, or freeze their butt off and decide to get help. My state changed bail, so getting arrested doesn't work anymore (unless it's a violent crime, they are released). 

She can pack up and get into recovery whenever she decides to try, but on top of the addiction power, I think she is too deep in her head concerned that she is depressed and wouldn't be wanted around.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970309734344482}"

I’ve been attending my NA meetings 3x a week in my city, the past 4 weeks and switched my OAT med to methadone which has been working really well for me. It has mostly combatted and worked well eliminating pretty much most of my DOC (drug of choice) drug cravings and thoughts but somehow today, after my usual NA meeting for some reason, I had a HUGE craving that I just could not overcome. For some reason, my cellphone felt like a thousand pounds and I felt like I couldn’t call anybody even though I probably should have and could have. Instead I called my dealer and got a $40 point of dope and smoked it in my usual areas: an unlit neighborhood street and the staircases of my apartment building. Man was I super disappointed in myself and wasn’t even worth it.

I also recently have asked someone to be my sponsor but we have not met up yet for our first appointment to go over everything and doing my steps and I didn’t feel comfortable enough to call her yet, as we just got acquainted 2 meetings ago. I am still quite new to narcotics anonymous as my addiction started a year back but fortunately I was able to start seeking help and treatment from my doctor in April this year because of my mom.

I started using Christmas time a year ago.  Would order on the deep web and that worked for a while until the DEA/FBI shut it down.  I casually used pressed roxies and stuff.  Used all drugs and have had 0 problems ever stopping, its just these damn opiates.  On top of the quite literal physical pain (and mental suffering/anxiety of the future) I turned to heroin.

All in a short span when I started a year ago - my grandfather passed away after some tragic years of amnesia and strokes and watching the deterioration.  my girlfriend and i separated after a long term relationship.  my mother had to deal with breast cancer.  and my MD continually deteriorates my muscles.  When i was a sophomore in High school (\~2014), one of my close friends and his mother committed double suicide together.  I was very young and this really took a toll on me.  I've seen many of my old friends go down roads I can relate to, but know are NOT for me.  my story is complex and long and confusing, and my mind is set in stone that no one can help me with some of my problems.  My parents blame themselves, but I'll come back around to that later on.  This is just to point out the main triggers that led to my start.  Over the next few months of Jan-March I was just using by the gram, making it last a week.  Now, for the last 4-5 months I was going through an 8ball of H every 3-4 days... bad. Spending $700 a week on heroin just to maintain. I know there's people out there with it worse than me, but with my medical problems this poison is just that - poison.   I never used needles, never would, and even though everyone claims ""you eventually get there,"" i know I never would have..  But i would snort and smoke til I could get away from this world I tend to hate so much some days.

While I was doing all of this, I ""successfully"" maintained through two college semesters, only failing a class (due to my usage 100%).  I planned for many weeks to confront and tell my parents over winter break (now).  I have a loving family and am very lucky in many ways.  I have a history of getting in trouble with the law or my parents or anything.  I've sold drugs, lots.  Nothing hard, just marijuana.  I planned on buying a car with the money I had been saving, but that was before the Devil of Heroin stole that from me.  I spent well over $20,000, probably more that I don't even account for with the gas money and whatnot, in just a span of a few months.  All while I paid my bills/rent/gas/food/drugs.  My parents pay for my school so I was able to hide my addiction very well being mostly self-sufficient.

Now, a week ago.  I told my parents and explained what I had been doing and that It had to stop over this break.  I'm a senior about to finish college (\~20 credits left).  Ohh, quick side note - I was expelled from college my freshman year, losing 15 credits due to being arrested with a pound of weed.  Like I say, I was a 'wild child,' albeit I am one of the most mentally gifted, intuitive, smart people I've ever known.  Not trying to brag, as i nearly threw it all away.  I want a future but I also don't at the same time.  I'm no longer afraid of death.  I've never OD'd or ever planned on it, but with the withdrawals sometimes it feels like the easy way out.  fuck that though, right?

I told my mom i was going to try and taper down for a few days and start with withdrawals, cause it HAD to be over this break or this next semester starting Jan 14 would not be an option.  I COULD continue to do this for the next half year, year, multiple years - but we all know it's just putting off the inevitable all the while you slowly taking days, months, years off your life.  But I did not care.  I did not care about a degree or a career anymore - just smoking my H and feeling 'right.'  Until feeling 'right' was now just 'not getting sick.'  I tried to taper some but was still using about a half a g a day.  I definitely cut back from the $350 8 balls I was getting - but money dwindled down over time and with me not able to sell weed in my college town I knew i was about to hit rock bottom.  I owe some people money, but they know me and know I WILL get them theirs.  I always have in every past situation, even if it was someone else's fault that I didn't have their cash.  This time it is MY fault.

5 days ago I started to withdrawal.  Utter hell.  No sleep, shit leaking out of my ass for 40 hours, 30+ times vomiting anything I drank, eating nothing, not able to get comfortable at all.  But my parents were there to support it as well as my older sister (nurse) to get my fluids via IV and whatnot.  After 40 hours, as many of us know, my mentality caved and I snuck a way to have my dealer get me a gram.  Didn't even hide it, and went to smoke it as my Dad walked in and caught me.  He took the bag but i had a small piece aside to smoke and after I hit just the tiniest amount I was 'normal.'  but the wrong kind of normal as we all know.  Not even high, just not sick.  I felt awful and knew my parents would be mad, thinking these last 40 hours all had just gone down the drain.  4-5 family members came over and it got kind of tense due to differing opinions and thoughts on what to do.  I just felt terrible even saying anything and should have handled it on my own, I'm an adult right?  But sometime, someday, we all as humans have to ask other humans for help.  Otherwise nothing we have in this world would be possible.

After I had smoked and we all discussed it - I pleaded for a deal to smoke one more time off some foil and then my sister discarded the rest.  They watched me which i never in a million years imagined they would see my smoking heroin inside their home.  But as you guys know - heroin does things to you you wouldnt imagine.  The WD's were unbearable.  To my surprise, the next day I was not set back.  I imagine this is because of how high my tolerance really was, so even though I relapsed after 40 hours it honestly did NOT set me back.

Now, 45 hours after that - i have 0 sickness but depression, anxiety, cravings, uncomfortability - but i believe the worst of it is behind me.  Of course my parents were suspicious that I just kept some but I really havent.  I was just as surpried that it didn't put me back to square one. I haven't mentioned my age but I am only 22 years old - having started some point when I was 21.

Just about 2 hours ago, being 43 hours since I had 'relapsed,' I took a small small piece of suboxone as I was confident it wouldn't put me in precipitated WDs.  It really has seemed to help as I wouldn't even have the desire or want to type all this out otherwise.  We all know how bad suboxone really is - just heroin dealers doing it legally.  Worse to get off than H.  I don't really plan on taking any more subs unless I really find it absolutely necessary but I do have a nearly full script I've held for months as a last resort because I will not be using Heroin forever.

I never thought I would be able to do this and it was pretty much forced on me by my family, with me agreeing somewhat.  After they caught my sneaking more in at the 40 hour mark - I agreed to hand my phone, keys, wallet, cash, everything over to them.  I hate myself for doing that and letting them discard my last bit of heroin, but I also thank myself for it.  It's a love/hate thing - I say things that are positive about wanting to quit and be clean of opiates, and then the WDs hit and it's the opposite where I am instantly scheming and craving and almost literally dying to get some.

It's been about \~85 hours since I initially first started and things are immensely better than I thought they would be.  I've NEVER had a problem with addiction of anything, or any drugs. Just this mu'fucking heroin MAN.  I never thought I would have been able to get this far and even though I relapsed I could cry like a baby I'm so surprised and happy that I am at least where I am at NOW.

Bottom line and thoughts - The war on drugs is evil and a scam.  Our government/pharma is absolute shit.  Fuck the Sackler family.  Fuck the doctors that ever introduced me to painkillers from surgeries and wisdom teeth and kidney stones I've had.  Fuck the doctors making thousands off addicts just getting hooked on Subs and lying about 'tapering off.'  Fuck myself for being curious enough to try it.  Fuck me 2x for spending \~25 grand in such a short time on some smoke - just some smoke.    I pray for a future where our world isn't so stigmatized against people like us.  We may be drug addicts but we are NOT bad people.  We all have things we can achieve and learn here.  Mike Majlak said it best - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EggMvfNotoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EggMvfNotoQ) (SKIP TO 1:00 to hear what he said).

It's gonna be the worst hell you may ever go through, regardless of what pain or grief you've been through.  I will not become another statistic of one of the tens of thousands of precious souls we have lost in just America.  This shit's a problem and I can only pray and advocate that one day it gets better.

Put one fucking foot in front of the other and keep. fucking. moving. forward.  Look your god damn self in the mirror and fuckin scream at yourself if you have to.  Have someone tie you the fuck down if you have to.  Get yourself the FUCK out of this cruel, seemingly endless, painful, torturous, and humiliating addiction.  I don't care how old you are, where you are in life, do something about it.  Don't ever give up even if you do relapse.  TALK to someone, anyone.  It doesn't matter - have a convo with your god damn dog if you must.

2019-12-23 14:17:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/eep3dv/low_selfesteem_drug_addiction/,Low Self-Esteem & Drug Addiction," I had a realization as of late and was doing some research on the topic.

I think the major reason why I, personally, chose to use is because I have low self-esteem that was rooted from traumatic experiences from other children in my early years.

It contributed to my living in anxiety for as long as I could remember from that point on. I remember my grandmother (who I spent a lot of time with in childhood) was very critical about everything about me, which I don't think helped the matter. Nothing was ever good enough for her. There would ALWAYS be this, or that, that was wrong with me.

Don't get me wrong, I love my grandmother very much. However, I think there was some unhealthy behavior that made me believe I was never good enough.

Whenever someone would say do you have high self-esteem, I would always say yeah I definitely do. I think good about myself, but did I really deep down?

*Why was it that I'd always be self-critical around others I didn't know?*

*Why was it that I'd always charge low for my services that I know I could charge higher for?*

*Why couldn't I say no to people when I didn't really want to do it?*

*Why did I like to seclude and isolate myself from others from weeks on end?*

*Why is expressing my desires so difficult to do?*

*Why did I feel I'm not good enough for a person I wanted to be in a relationship with?*

*Why was my gauge for happiness based on my lifestyle and money I was making?*

*Why when I lost all the money I was on the brink of suicide and the drugs were the only thing that would make me feel better?*

These types of questions had me torn.

Did I REALLY have a healthy self-esteem if I **HONESTLY** did these things?

I think if I was completely honest with myself... I didn't.

Which is the whole reason I believe I used. I wasn't addicted to the chemical.

I could go weeks on end without using and not even think about it, but something would trigger me to WANT to use.

What was that trigger?

I have realized that the trigger was my self-criticism and subconscious self-induced emotional pain and the only way to cope with it and take a break from it for a while was using drugs.

Every time he got up, the demons would rise. To pull him back down, barely alive. Never give up the hopeless man cried. Fight your way forward, if only to try.

Try as he must, he couldn't yet fly. Dragging these demons, every inch he would sigh. Life is too hard, just let me die.

Die I will not, his brain would attest. Onward he'll go, to take on the rest. Never lament, never regress. I made it this far, pounding his chest.

As he trudged on, the demons lost grip. The hopless man had hope, he wouldnt let trip. Crawls became walks, and walks became strides. His once dark world started to rise.

Rise from the dead, the hopeless man did. Never look back, never surrender. Life is too short, you must always remember.

The hopeful man was forever changed, to help those before him, into the darkness from where he came. He helped fight those demons, unnerved, unchained. No man left behind, his motto became.

Together we stand, together we fall. No one amongst us can carry it all. Stand as we must, upright and tall. A group is the strongest, we are one for all.

Miracles happen when hopeless men fall, this is my experience and i share it for all...",17,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9066434502601624}"

I’m already in the field I want to be in and I love it. This would be a very special subset of my current profession. Better yet I know I’d be good at it.

I thought I was just going to have to live with this pill addiction for the rest of my life. Even though I wanted to stop, I couldn’t. But here I am, cleaner then I’ve been in a whole year. No cravings, feeling almost 100 percent. Wow the tapering really is the key, the last time I tried this I was still not feeling right on day 6. After two days of absolute zero sleep, I hoped into bed exhausted thinking I would sleep. Nope, didn’t happen. I had to take a Xanax, I took half this time. Put me right to bed, I figured since a whole Xanax would put me out for 5-6 hours, half would do the same. Welp, I woke up for work six hours later and something amazing happened, I was sleepy! I finally woke up six hours later and felt like I just wanted to keep sleeping. And I did! Slept till about 12, it was amazing. I finally feel like my brain isn’t sending out those anxiety and fight or flight signals. I am at 95 percent I would say, cuz I actually feel kinda sleepy still. So guys, there is hope. Don’t let it get to the point of heroin, that’s the no turning back spot. This isn’t a game, this is life for or death shit, and it’s nothing to play with. If you don’t stop now you WILL eventually pick up the needle, it’s only one plug away from happening. It’s a dangerous game. So guys please, taper down to 30mg, buy Imodium, weed edibles and Xanax, take 5 says of rest, and kick the shit out of this obsession. I’m sorry to those who use to cop with childhood trauma, I’m one of the ones who stumbled into this game because I’m an experimenter. I had a great childhood and a great life now. Sober life sucks guys but guess what, there’s weed and alcohol! So if your sad about living life sober, that’s just food for thought, there are other intoxicants to keep you busy that aren’t nearly as destructive. You WILL get that drive again and you WILL want to smoke and drink. With willpower you will not touch the stuff. But you have to be ready to kick it because you want to, not because you have to. We all know there’s always a way to get dope, so you won’t ever HAVE to, unless your on probabtion. Anyways dudes good luck and write me anytime!

Long story and TLDR,"Ya so still figuring out how to start this but I’m just gonna put it all out there, edit into paragraph and make a tldr so here it goes. 

Have a messed up back(DDD/scoliosis / sciatica) anxiety/depression, and a pretty severe panic disorder. I’ve  been seeing a pain doc for the last 5 years. Been on as little as 30mg Hydro a day and as high as 200mg MS ER, 120mg Oxy IR, 3x Soma 350s And 8mg Xanax a day. I know it’s a fuck ton I’m lucky to still be alive writing this. In fact when I was at that dose it messed up my HPGA and I need supplemental Androgel daily still (2 pumps (40.5mg Test) a day. As of this month I was off the Soma, off the Morphine, down 1/4 on the Xanax to 6mg/day, and still took 90mg oxycodone IR daily, 3 X 30mg. Been this way for about 6 months 

Well after my last refill I ran out in 7 days. It’s a mix of using them to get high, kill mental/depression pain, boredom and legit ass pain from just living. I’ve also been spending increasing amounts of my money on buying blues from other friends with Rxs. Last month I spent nearly a grand. After that first week I said fuck all this BS and turned to the 80 or so mg of Suboxone/Bupe I had in my freezer. Did a two week long taper with a daily schedule of: 8mg, 8, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1.5, 1 and jump. 

The jump was last Thursday and yeah I was expecting a lot more physical discomfort, but got away with feeling like I had a mild cold last 2 weeks for the taper, and maybe a minor flu starting that night that’s almost gone today (Sunday). 

What I didn’t account for was the psychological side of this. I’ve detoxed off a lower dose before, Outpatient Suboxone rehab over 6 months and the sobriety lasted about 18 months. But now....we’ll the boredom and malaise and lethargy are why I’m typing this long ass post. I did buy and 8 ball, and that helped me get shit done last 3 days but no more of that. Last thing I need is to transfer addictions but yeah. I did relapse Saturday, not from pain just boredom...intra-nasal last 45mg oxy with blow...stupid idea felt horrible rest of the day when that tiny fuck up wore off. But yah...Friday and Today Sunday are the only two days I’ve gone without opis in at least 5 years.  I’m happy about it, but horribly depressed and reaching out to Reddit to see how you guys cope with, I guess this is technically PAWS. Seeking therapy first thing tomorrow, not religious and have gotten bad vibes from 12 steps in the past so imma try to find another kind of secular group.

When down comes the cut from the back of your throat

That smell of vinegar, gas or whatever no longer lingers and and down comes the weather
But the illusion it helps and the warmth it creates keeps you tethered
You’ll try and try but no matter how much you hope the pull towards your vices is to much to cope

I've been a longtime lurking of the sobriety and recovery subreddit for some time now. I've been battling an opiate addiction for 13 years now, since the summer after my college graduation. I'm working on a whole about me post for my blog that I've decided to put together, but for the meantime I'm just tweeting my thoughts, struggles, and hopefully successes.

It isn't that I didn't know that it is absolutely insane to sell your iPhone for $200 to buy pills for two days, only to have to replace your phone so you don't loose your job, it is just that I rationalized it. Writing it here, on Twitter, in a blog - in the public, yet somewhat anonymous domain has given me a way to really see the insanity in my actions and my struggle with addiction in a way I couldn't have predicted.

I'm hoping it will help with accountability, keep me honest (as I can't tell anyone IRL these things), and also hopefully help others.

I would love input, feedback, followers, pretty much any sort of just knowledge that someone else is there. Someone else has gone through this. There is a light at the other end of the tunnel.

I have had severe migraines for over 25 years. I’ve been to various doctors (primary care, two neuros, pain management doctor [this is my current one], gynecologist [migraines are awful during my cycle, sorry if that’s TMI), GI doc to see if something was going on it’s my gut as I tend to have outbreaks that are VERY similar to cyclic vomiting syndrome) and I’ve tried every med I could safely take (beta blockers + blood pressure medication = no bueno bc my BP and heart rate are already so low: Topamax really lived up to its nickname of dopamax; I have a whole list but I’ll spare you).

Anyway, when I had to leave a final (100% of my grade) early due to a horrible migraine attack, i knew I had to do something. My mom’s best friend gets migraines and takes this medication, and when we were getting a hurricane, the pressure was going nuts so naturally, my head started pounding. My mom gave me one of her best friend’s pills. It knocked me tf out, but I woke up pain free. I went to a neurologist after the whole graduate school final thing, and I asked what she thought of putting me on Fiorinal with Codeine with us butalbital-aspirin-caffeine-10mg. She didn’t see an issue, and I had no issues up until recently. I was so very careful, but it took over. I became addicted and used to binge for 10 days at a time u til I could get my refill.

**BUT: I am now on day 10 of being clean. Longest streak I ever had, and I KNOW I can keep going.**

I do need the painkillers for my bad migraines. They respond to nothing, even meds specifically for migraines like the triptans (Imitrex, Relpax, Maxalt, etc.).

I am on day 10 so I’ve done my time in WD jail with the 5-7 days. **My question is... if I get a bad migraine that is unresponsive to everything, will taking one painkiller unravel all my progress?** I don’t plan on binging as I know my body’s tolerance is going down minute by minute. However, I work a full-time, high-profile job that requires full attention, lots of computer time, and working between 60 and 75-80 hours a week.  I can’t afford to miss a day. Well, maybe one day but my migraines, if left untreated, will last multiple days including me vomiting for all that time. So.. does anyone know the answer?

It was sold to me by saying it has less effect on constipation than other opiates.

I have found it EASY relatively speaking to get off of oxy or hydro. No problem compared to tramadol.

They say taper but I am now cutting 50 mg pills into 1/4 so I'm taking 12 mg about every 24 hours … I'm expanding  the time between pills BUT ...

I am stressed and miserable about half the time (meaning the first 12 hours are OK but the next 12 suck!!). Get anxious, twitching, depressed, etc.

I have taken Lyrica to help with the opiate addiction side - nerve stuff. I worked the first time (after 3-4 months of Tramadol) but not doing much this time after 3 months. Both times taken for the pain after serious surgeries.

Is there any reason this should be more difficult the second time?

IMHO, this drug should have GREAT warnings as it screws with serotonin, etc. I think the negative impact of this drug will be analyzed for decades. Just stay away if at all possible!!

Should I ignore my doctor's instructions and take less? She also does not want me to try to taper down quickly, but I might have no choice.","I had my first outpatient MAT appointment yesterday, and it was absolutely wonderful.  My addiction has been my deepest, darkest secret for 2 years, and I can't say enough about how huge a relief it was to put everything out on the table and talk about it with someone who is so compassionate and understanding.

I was started on a 2 mg buprenorphine, .5 mg naloxone dose.  I took my first dose last night as instructed, and before I knew it, I was HIGH!  It was a different kind of high than what I usually get from my pills -- I felt more alert and clear-headed -- but it still felt like a high to me.  In fact, I felt better on that stuff than I've felt in quite a while on pills.

2 mg is the lowest starting dose the outpatient facility even offers.  Will they be okay with me splitting my next dose in half?  I go back for an appointment tomorrow, during which I'm supposed to take the suboxone in front of my doctor.  I don't want to make the mistake of starting at too high a dose and making it that much harder for me to quit subs down the road.  Since I had this reaction to the lowest dose of suboxone, I'm guessing my habit would actually be considered pretty mild?  I don't know... I've been dosing with opiates/opioids daily for 2 years now, though that came with several failed attempts to quit via a rapid taper once every couple months or so.  I have access to almost any type of pain pill out there and in any amount, so it's hard to say exactly what my average daily dosage was because I didn't keep track.  But just for reference, the last day I did pills, I took about 40 mg of hyrocodone, 10 mg of dilaudid, and 60 mg of codeine. 

Also, when I told my doctor that I'm interested in tapering down off the subs fairly rapidly, she clearly did not like the idea.  She told me to use this time to focus on my recovery and to not worry about trying to taper down.  She implied that I will be on the subs for a year, possibly longer.  Since I apparently don't need more than 1 mg of buprenorphine to start, couldn't I feasibly taper down and quit much faster than that?  I have an international flight to Taiwan booked for the end of January, and I can't find much information online about whether or not I'll be able to take subs with me.  I'm terrified of the idea of the TSA searching through my bag and harassing me about my prescription, not only because it's humiliating and annoying when they do this, but also because my husband doesn't know about my addiction or the fact that I'm getting treatment for it.  It would be horrible of him to find out that way!  I fully plan on telling him myself someday when I've been off pills for longer, but I'm SO not ready for that yet.

Up until this situation I always used to scoff at the people who claim they had no idea how their urine is positive. After using for so long it's easy to tell who is doing the right thing and who isn't. I do not need a urine test. However I do have my doubts after my experiance. 

I have gone to a third party lab to see if my clinics lab does indeed have poor quality control.

My counselor will not put in a word for me. Despite this being my first illegitmlamite dirty since I presented at the clinic 10 months ago. I've kept two jobs since I cleaned up my act. Gotten everything I ever put in the pawn shop out. Paid fines to whoever was saying I had them. I've taken care of my family. I've proposed doing community service for the clinic i go to. And still this one issue is putting me back to square one at the clinic.

It does not make sense to deal in absolutes in addiction treatment. If this was a legitimate relapse and continued for a few weeks I'd agree. However this weeks urine test is CLEAN.

It’s weird cause none of my band mates really care I don’t know why they are in it at all. I have 75 followers which is basically 0. 
It’s like everyone is fine in their lives without me. I’m a needy fucker but I can’t find someone else who needs me.

**Edit at almost 11 days clean:** Again, I know that’s relatively small compared to others’ achievements in sobriety, but my biggest win today was actually something else.

It was when I got a bad migraine — the kind I’m prescribed pain pills for or I puke for day, can’t function, and end up in the ER. I didn’t know what to do, and I even tried all the usual stuff that doesn’t work, that I KNEW didn’t work. I even wasted an Imitrex I knew wasn’t going to work because the migraine had progressed too much. In a last ditch effort to get rid of the guilt of what I was probably going to do, I came on here to ask how far back one painkiller would set me, and everyone told me it was a slippery slope.

But man, I was in excruciating pain. So.. some of you will chastise me for this; others may think it’s quite interesting.

Me? I’m PERPLEXED.

I took my NORMAL dose to get rid of a migraine of this severity: two pills (20mg of codeine + bunch of other stuff in the pill).

That’s it.

That’s all I did.

My migraine went away, and I had zero desire to pop any more pills.

I know cravings go into the post-acute phase so I honestly was as shocked as I was prepared to urge surf for a few days to ensure I didn’t binge again.

Anyway.. besides me being stupid for taking that huge risk, anyone got any ideas as to what happened? Is it a chemical thing? Genetic? I’m not on any anti-craving medications. I detoxed myself using medications I had left over from a previous detox.


**Original at 8 days:** I know this may not be much to some of you but as a chronic relapser, I never made it past 6 days. I am hoping I finally got it through my head now to quit this stuff unless I need it (severe migraines).

Those of you who used to chronically relapse or keep bouncing between subs and dope what did it take for you to finally get considerable clean time?  For the last year I've been bouncing between Sub and dope and it has got to stop.  I'm also noticing the sub is becoming less and less effective.

First the good news: I am 77 days clean. I had been using for well over 5 years. Starting with oxy, graduated to heroin. If you feel like reading a mini novel check my post history and you read the long version. Long story short, I lost everything and then some. Having 77 days under my belt feels amazing. I can honestly say, I feel like a new man. The best version of myself and the thought of using again makes my skin crawl. I’ve been around friends of mine who still use while they’ve shot up, I’ve handled oxy’s that I’ve sold, and not once have I been tempted to relapse, not once.

I want to preface the bad news that I’m about to share with first stating that I wasn’t completely honest in my original post that I made a month or two ago. I alluded that my wife had gotten clean too as the same time as me, but she didn’t. I didn’t feel like explaining why this was for numerous reasons. I’ve learned a few things regarding recovery/addition and as I’m sure a lot of you will attest, a person can’t quit on another persons behalf. They have to want to do it themselves. She wasn’t ready to quit. I did more or less give her an ultimatum but I also wanted to be reasonable as I love and care about her immensely. We agreed to her using for a few months due to her having just gotten a new job and she is currently supporting the both of us so I couldn’t expect her to go through hell and obviously start a new career while she supports us both for the time being. She also told me she wasn’t ready to quit yet.

About two weeks ago she tells me she feels ready to quit. I think her seeing me basically transform into a healthier/better and more accountable version of myself, really inspired her. She was also dealing with being sick all the time, shitty dope, even shittier dealers, and she just had enough. I had extra subs and Xanax on hand to make the withdrawals as painless as possible. I am happy to report that she is 1 week clean. She turned the corner yesterday and is feeling better and better, and was even able to attend a social event this evening and worked the past two days. I try to be very encouraging and supportive and constantly remind me of how great she is doing, how she’s saving her own life, in addition to our marriage, and while there will undoubtedly be bumps in the road here and there, she’s going to reclaim her identity and reap the endless rewards of being opiate/heroin free.

Now that all of that is out of the way I’ll get to the bad news and where I need some advice/help. A family member of our gifts us roughly 100 roxy’s a month. These roxys played a huge role in our downfall and eventually lead to us getting addicted to heroin and losing everything. Now that we’re not using them I sell them and it’s obviously very lucrative as you guys are aware. I am in possession of them but I never let her see them or know where they are (out of sight out of mind), as I am not only much further along but I just have more discipline and self control. Up until this evening it hasn’t been an issue. We split the money I make and it basically covers almost our entire rent, which is obviously awesome, as we are in this transition period getting clean. 

I made a terrible mistake of showing her that I actually found a single pill on the ground when I was cleaning earlier. We always joked and lamented over how many drugs and pills we have lost in our bedroom and many times out of pure desperation we have searched and almost never found anything, but now that we’re sober a magical blue appears. Since she has found out about this one pill she will not stop asking me for it. To the point where she’s getting me non stop. I’ve explained to her this is an awful idea, not to mention she’s on subs so she won’t even feel the effects but it hasn’t deterred her one bit. She now is demanding not only that I give her the pill, but she wants to start taking 1 pill a week. Like I previously mentioned we are gifted those oxy’s and she is demanding that she take one a week and is really adamant. It’s scaring me, angering me, and besides telling her “no”, “that’s a terrible idea”, I don’t know what else to say. I was hoping for some advice regarding how to logically explain to her why this a bad idea. She swears up and down it would only be one, but as I previously mentioned she has zero self control and I’m in the midst of a real crisis here. I love her more then anything but I don’t want to be with someone who is using, even 1 pill a week (like that’s even possible..) and the whole situation is really overwhelming me, hence why I’ve brought it to you guys.

Many of them travel to PA for Suboxone clinic help and other outpatient & inpatient treatment. It really bothers me knowing that WV has the highest rates of addiction and overdose deaths, yet the help is nonexistent. I'm curious to get some insight from others in WV and what their lives are like seeking treatment in their state. I am extremely bothered that their government offers no help to an area in such need. If the services are so hard to find, how can an addict have a path toward success? I want to get more involved but seem to hit dead ends because I'm not a resident of the state (when trying to find treatment options).

What they need to do is be completely honest with kids about drugs.

Original post from /u/vanman33:

> Hey guys, I just want to make a post right now because I feel like I have noticed a major uptick in the posts discussing suicide in a very concerning way. If you are suicidal, or even entertaining the thought of suicide you need to get help. NOW.
I'll paraphrase a response I gave in another thread: opiate addiction already has a ridiculously high mortality rate, when you add in depression and suicidal ideation you would have a better chance of survival getting ebola while cave diving. I don't want to diminish the value of this message board, and I don't want to discourage people from posting here if they are struggling with this stuff, but I can't stress enough that considering suicide goes FAR beyond the purview of this forum.
So, if you are considering suicide PLEASE get help. Tell a loved one. Tell a doctor. Call a hotline. Go to an Urgent Care or ER. Call 911. Ask someone to hold onto any firearms for you. Whatever it takes. I tried to kill myself in 2008 and have lost too many friends since then. I fucking hate cliches, but it really is a permanent solution to temporary problems.

> You CAN do this. Please, if you are considering suicide you should know that you can walk into any medical clinic anywhere in the United States and tell them you think you might hurt yourself and you will get treatment. You could walk into a fucking plastic surgery clinic and if you said you were concerned you might hurt yourself they would either render care (unlikely) or get you to someone who would ASAP.

Do you guys think if I use Vyvanse to get through the first month of withdraw. That when I stop taking them I’ll go right back to being completely bleh?

It’s been about two months since I was in active fentanyl addiction and except for one day of weakness I’ve been clean from all opiates during that time. I was still dabbling in other drugs however, namely weed, and I’ve hesitantly decided to try abstaining from everything because I could see myself straying back into bad thoughts and behaviors regardless of how “harmless” I kept insisting marijuana was to myself. 

I still think weed is pretty harmless, just not for me.

And holy shit, this SUCKS. In some weird way giving up weed feels harder than giving up dope. It’s been my safety net for so long and this is the first time in like 5 years that I’ve made a conscious decision to go without it.

I have posted here a few times before offering advice and stories about the past. A little on my backstory, I started smoking OC 80s recreationally when i was 17 in 2007 off and on due to finding a family members prescription lying around the house. I told my self i would never buy them. It wasn’t until they changed the formula to the OPs that i found it wasn’t the same feeling just popping them so I started buying 30s. Told my self i would never shoot them. It wasn’t until 30s became way to pricey and realized i needed more for my buck then i took my first shot in 2012. Told my self i would never do heroin. It wasn’t until 30s became hard to find and i realized Heroin could get me 10 times higher for 10 times less.  We all tell our self these things that we think we will never do until we become desperate and corrupted in the mind from the constant mental abuse.

I had periods of clean time. 3 months here, relapse. 6 months here, relapse. 8 months here. Relapse. I could never make it a full year due to me being a fucked up person i would always find some 30s, OP 80s, or methadone in my house once the scripts got refilled. I finally moved out of the house and started putting my money to better use, paying rent and bills to live on my own. I was doing well for a few months but the addiction was still lurking behind me. Fentanyl started to replace the Heroin market in 2016-2017 and things weren’t getting any better. I bought a g one day and when a friend came into town from his rehab and he was ultimately at the same point of searching for a relapse. I gave him a few lines and smoked a little bit, luckily didn’t shoot it. He ended up overdosing and falling out in my backyard, lips blue, seizing. It took 3 shots nasally and 1 IV to bring him back to a stable condition.  When they did his blood work it turns out he was smoking crack that morning and basically OD’d and had a heart-attack simultaneously. They told me if  he didn’t make it that i would of caught an involuntary manslaughter charge. We decided i was going to go rehab 3 days later on the first of the month. Jan 1 2017. 

I entered impatient, did a 30 day stay with no MAT. I wanted the pain, the withdrawals, the sickness. Experiencing those feelings were the only things that would force me to change my life.
I had to punish myself for the things i had done and i felt the best way was to drive my self to brink of insanity. I got out 30 days later riding the pink cloud. Yes things are better now or so i thought. Went to go on a little clean and sober outing with a buddy i had met in rehab thinking “Wow this will be nice to hang out completely clean and sober and just have fun.” Nope. He had relapsed the day he got out 2 days before me and didn’t mention it, so when i saw him holding a little bag of green 15 mg oxys i couldn’t resist as much as i wanted to. As soon as i sniffed a few i was off to the races, buying wax bags of dope in a new town hundreds of miles from my home. After you go 30 days there is nothing but regret and guilt. It’s not the same as it once was. I knew i needed more therapy and couldn’t go back to inpatient due to insurance and no money so they approved IOP. 4 hours a day, 3 times a week for a 2 months. 

Needless to say that didn’t work either. As many times as i got clean i relapsed again when I got back to my hometown.  They say relapse is part of recovery right? Then i was definitely recovering. People, Places and things. You hear this shit hundreds of times when you are in inpatient and meetings.  The feeling of being in my hometown. The sights, The places i got high, running into old friends. The despair and depression. It was inevitable. I thought I couldn’t go any lower. Found a new dope connect, bought some coke from the Salvadorans i was doing construction with, and started shooting speedballs. The girl i was buying shit from house got raided and i knew it was a sign. It was time to stop, It has been 10 years of using on and off and if I don’t stop now i will be dead or in jail along with the others.

It wasn’t the sickness that made me stop it was the pure depression. I was planning on killing my self. I took my last dose of methadone on December 7th, 2018. 
I wish i could say things are perfect like all the success stories you read. To everyone in early recovery one year doesn’t solve everything, everyone’s situation is different but for the most part it will take time. Even if it takes years i am ok with that. I have no significant other but i am grateful for what i do have. I am emotionally stable, Renting a shitty apartment in a low income apartment complex and have an ok job that keeps me busy. I consider it almost like a nonprofit. The pay is just enough to survive and they give you benefits and time off. I am happy that the anxiety and cravings have finally stopped so that is something for the newbies to look forward to. Once the active addiction is over, now the real struggle begins. LIFE. 

I am thankful for everyone here in the recovery sub and reading all of the posts every day, To be honest its the first thing i do when i get off work every day.

My trust in him is broken and I am constantly suspicious. For the past few days I've smelled the same smell on his breath. It might be oxys but it might also be my imagination.

I've been a lurker on here for quite some time and have gained some great insight and motivation.  It really is nice to know that I'm not alone in my struggle.  I've been attempting to shelve my addiction to opiates (Norco/oxy) for good, and have come a long way the last few months.  My addiction began like so many others, starting with an overprescribing doctor after back to back shoulder surgeries.  

I'm completely blown away the power this disease has on my mind, every time I think I have it beat I slip up.  At my worst, I was a daily user of roughly 90-120mg of oxy (about 8mo ago) but as of the last handful of months its just been Norco.  About a month ago I completely detoxed from everything and made it about 10 short days before I broke down and took a handful of Norco.  I was instantly angry and disgusted with myself, and told myself I wouldn't go back to where I was before.  I have a hatred for these damn pills.  However, no matter how convinced I am in my head that ""I won't slip up again"", a handful of days goes by and I find myself repeating my damn mistake (then feeling like crap for a day or two).  It's like my mind keeps trying to trick myself over and over until I give in, and I'm just becoming so incredibly upset with myself.  I'm doing much better overall, working out daily, getting up early, and feeling better in general... but then I'll cave and find myself losing the battle in my mind every 4 or 5 days.  The mental battle is just exhausting.  

Part of why I wanted to make a post was to provide some accountability for myself and write down some thoughts.  I also wanted to hear from some people who have been able to quit and make it out of these trenches, and find out what you tell yourself when battling this terrible cycle.   I've also began writing down exactly how I feel after I give in, to remind myself and reinforce those thoughts in my brain.  

I'm grateful for this community, and I wish everyone the strength to beat this crap.  If you made it this far, thank you for reading.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970011115074158}"

2019-12-06 18:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/e76olz/im_clean/,I'm clean,"So I've been talking with a few people on here about the way that I tapered. I didn't want to make it a general post because I was afraid of being judged and thought weak. But I've just been informed that I have been oxy-free for anywhere from 2 days to a week. My husband has been giving me less and less, and I've stopped taking gabapentin, and I asked him to not tell me how fast I was tapering. Anyone who thinks he's being forced into this or whatever is wrong because he took the reins when he knew I couldn't. He was willing to save my life, and i'd do it for him too in a heartbeat. I've had it in the back of my head that this weekend I was going to stop completely in order to go to an Of Monsters and Men concert--I've adopted them as my getting clean band. My husband just told me that i've already been clean. Psychosomatism and fucking with my own head is something I specialize in--like many of us--so I feel like this was the best way for us to do it because now I can't talk myself into thinking I should be feeling a certain way based on what day I'm on. 

Don't get me wrong, I feel like microwaved shit and just cried a lot because i couldn't believe that I have lived even a day without that poison. I developed an attachment to it when I was a child and I've never gone without it by choice since I was a teenager. I'm 37 and I don't know what to expect from this new way of living. Tomorrow he's gonna tell me how long it's been that he's been giving me nothing but tylenol. 

I have an obsession with time--what time am I gonna take it? How long till my next dose?--that has been my constant companion for at least 13 years. I need to learn how to look at time as something other than a chain around my neck. I have deep bruising and damage from that chain, and my neck feels bare without it--like I'm naked and lost in a place I've never been before. But it feels good to get it off. I fucking refuse to be a slave anymore. 

I'm all over the place. Please, if you're going to judge me for taking the route I did then keep that judgement in your head. I'm finally done, and that's what matters. I can live a real life as soon as I figure out what that is.

I found different opinions with regard the possibility of precipitated withdrawal.

Is it a real possibility? 
Given then the patches release the substance very gradually and slowly, by the time I get 1mg in my body, the heroin will have left the receptors already.

I've currently worked my way up to 160 odd pills a day to be comfortable. Like most I had a long history of opiate addiction prior to the loperamide, and the reason I started on it was to be able to pass urine drug screens at my sober living house (halfway house not a rehab by any means) and still have a buzz, a feeling, anything at all. I'm here by LAW and when I first got here, I didnt really want to be clean so I'd pop 72 to 96 generic loperamide and it was a nice boost that would last me a few days. I'd grown fond of and comfortable taking lopes to avoid opiate withdrawal since 2013, but that's all I'd use it for. Had no idea how physically addicting it was, or how serious the heart risks were.

I remember the drop in my stomach when I realized that I was physically hooked on anti diarrheal medicine. I immediately said enough is enough and tried to quit but the withdrawals from this was freaking intense! Worse than when I kicked 65 mg a day methadone in jail and that was back when I'd only been on them for a month at much lower doses. I had to get a shitty job, play the part of recovering addict and attend 12 step meetings so I couldnt afford to kick in habit in bed for a few weeks. My whole family was counting on me.

I should have started tapering then, but I didnt really want to be clean, I was still depressed so I just kept taking them. If I wasnt getting drug tested and had to stay in the sober living community I'd have left right there and gotten on methadone. Besides at the time I didnt even have a car or enough money to pay for the clinic. 

I couldn't order kratom to the house for risk of the package being opened and getting kicked out. A few times I bought the overpriced kratom at the smoke shop determined to kick, and I must say it worked fairly well. I could take several grams, several times a day and take about 30 lopes (back when I only needed 96 a day) before bed and still be able to function. But I wasnt willing to spend 50 dollars every day on kratom when I could steal the loperamide for free.

So I pushed my fears of heart problems and my shame for being addicted to loperamide to the back of my mind and accepted it. I got a great job, I saved up some money, I bought my own car, new phone, new clothes, my family is proud of me, made sober friends and connections, all the gifts of recovery. As long as I had my lopes, I felt normal, maybe had more energy, but I wasnt really high or euphoric. With a never ending supply and supermarkets on every corner I never run out. At times I'd get a taste of the nasty withdrawal, which would lead me to pop more pills and my habit would grow. Soon I was taking a 120, to needing 144 and then some. I've only needed 160 a day for a month but my vision is starting to get blurry and that cant be good.

 The withdrawals are so freaking intense and I only have 40 days left at the sober living house until I can just go to the methadone clinic and move into my own place. I've started tapering until then starting yesterday I only took 120 pills. I plan on taking only 120, one single dose at night so I can sleep, for the next 10 days or until I feel stabilized and then slowly drop from there. How slow? I'm not sure let. Probably a little trial and error here. 

I should note that my dose of 160 pills usually lasts me 18 hours until I start to get very, very sick. No way to possibly cold Turkey this much

I'm getting really bad anxiety, fast elevated heartrate. I stopped taking xanax after day 5, and I had a few left. It's helping for sure, but what's scaring me is this pounding heart and I'm even thinking heart arrhythmia because I used a heartrate monitor and I'll feel my heart skip a beat every couple minutes. My family has a history of heart issues (although always later in life). I kinda want to talk to a doctor about it, but I also want to be honest with him. If this elevated heartrate is a normal PAWs thing, I think I'll give it another couple days. I'd rather not get ""opiate withdrawl"" added to my medical record. I woke up to a 77bpm which is still a lot higher than I'm used to when waking up (50-60).

It's resting at 80-90 so not dangerous per se.. but... it's enough to screw up my sleep and make me short of breath. I've been exercising a little TOO hard. 30 minutes of running, and 30 minutes of lifting each day. Should I chill out on that?

Is this normal? This isn't my first relapse/recovery rodeo, but this heart thing is new. Maybe I'm just thinking about it too much which makes it worse.

How are we? What's going on? I hope everyone is happy and healthy. My life has changed drastically.
I'm currently inpatient if you know my story. I have 66 days clean. I'm happy. I'm healthy and I'm doing the right thing. Positive changes in my life are coming. I was so ready to quit. The last day I used, I threw an ounce of heroin and an ounce of meth to some other users and walked away. That's how serious I was.

I was always caught up in the fast life and the law caught up with me. I've picked up 5 cases this year alone  and was looking at significant prison time. That has changed. I'm still looking at some but not as much.

Originally I picked up a heroin trafficking, meth manufacturing, poss for sales, poss with intent and a slew of other charges on 1 case. I picked up another sales case with 4 felonies, they dropped it to 1 and I got a plea deal.

Now they've filed the bigger case, as well as 2 others. BUT THEY DROPPED THE HEROIN TRAFFICKING AND METH MANUFACTURING charges. Those carry significant weight. I have 10 charges through all 3 cases, only 4 are felonies. I'm still going to have to fight poss with intent x's 2 and transporting a controlled dangerous substance x's 2.

Here's the kicker, when I found out they filed. I wanted  to run run run but I didn't. My life is exponentially better now..I finally love myself, like myself and I'm  fucking happy finally. 

I have court monday, but it's kinda fucked up, they might take me in because I have a bench warrant, i have probation violations and I'm absconding from a sentence. It's time to clean stuff up. It's time to give back to society and it's time to live and feel loved.

I’ve been rummaging around these parts for a couple months now, and it has been such a blessing to me. I absolutely love giving y’all encouragement and what little advice I can, it really fills my heart up in a way I can’t quite describe. I have never actually had an issue with opiates; cocaine and meth were by bugaboos back in the day (next year is 20 years clean from both). Here’s why I’m here:

In the spring of 2018, I began dating a girl I was madly in love with from the word go. I knew without a doubt she was the woman I was going to marry. So much so that last July I cosigned on a car with her; sure, I was nervous, but I was just so in love. A month later, things started to get tense between us. She ran late for everything, told me I was being “clingy” and was sometimes impossible to get ahold of. This continued until January of this year, when I got the first shock to my system.

We’d planned a dinner, and I cooked filet mignons for both of us. They turned out badass. I had them ready at the time she said she’d be at my house, and about that time she texted me to say she’d be there in another hour or so, as her roommate had cooked dinner. Obviously, having made plans to eat together, this was weird. When she finally showed up, she was very hungry (?), and also very...pilled out. I know how downers make people act when they take too much, and she was far past that. Falling over my ottoman, very slurred speech, etc. I asked her what pill she had taken, but for hours she denied she’d taken anything. Finally, she blurted out that she’d taken a xanax. 

This really shook me, because it was the first time I saw her take a lie as far as she could before she finally relented and told something towards the truth. I begged her never to lie to me again, but over the next week she lied to me another 3 times. I should have known then there was trouble. That same month, her dad went into the hospital, so all cares about pills went by the wayside as we focused on being there for him, her mom, and the rest of the family. 

Fast forward to March, dad was well and home, and things between us had gone back to tense. Once again she said I was being clingy, and I couldn’t help but have suspicions based on a number of clues I had seen. One Saturday she was at work, but her laptop was in my room. It’s all apple, so the texts she sends from her phone sync to it. Well, the top text was to a guy asking if he had roxies. I didn’t really know what they were, so I googled them, found the other names for them, etc. She planned to meet him on her break that day to hook up. I found dozens of these texts, going back months and months.

Then, I did a keyword search for sexual words. Three men popped up, and in those messages I saw her telling them how she wanted to be fucked, I saw every sexy picture or video she had ever sent me, I saw my whole world crumbling. I messaged her and told her I knew, but she did not read it. So I drove to her work, calmly walked in and asked her to read what I had sent. She went into tears as I walked out the door, and called me crying minutes later. We talked, and she admitted (some) of what she’d done and begged me to take her back. Well, y’all, I’m a fool, and I did. 

From March-July of this year, she kept using, kept sexting other guys, and kept lying to me about all of it. The manner in which she lied and the lengths she would go to in order to protect them from getting out astounded me. Once she ran into my house saying she had to poop really bad. No, she was snorting a pill. Once she sent me a picture of a clean drug test after I asked her to take one for me. Turns out she had gotten a pill before she took it so she could get high right after. The lies numbered in the hundreds, and sadly I know full well that I was never told the full truth. In looking back, it wasn’t really a relapse, the signs were there from the beginning of our relationship that she was already on pills. 

All throughout, each time a lie was uncovered she swore it would be the last; that I was what she needed to quit using and become a better person. I let her know that once she was clean, the work would begin on me, in order for her to gain my trust back. I let her know what those things were, and oddly enough most of them involved her doing things that would help with her recovery. I wanted her to take walks, to journal, to talk to her parents about how the way they brought her up led to some of the issues that caused her addiction. She did some of it, but only begrudgingly. I had tried to start all of it off just as I talk to all of y’all--only encouragement, positivity, and the like. That got me more lies. What I found worked was a tough love approach. Unfortunately, that also served to drive a wedge between us, and basically damn the whole relationship. But, if she stays clean, it will be worth it for me, a sacrifice I would make again. 

There is so much more I could say, but I’ll leave it here. Just know that getting to chat with you all has really helped me over the past 2 months; my natural state is an encourager, not a probation officer, so to be able to get back to what I tried and failed at with her and see it actually helping you all is a boon for me and my soul. I love each and every one of you, and if you should ever have a question about the perspective from my side of things, please do let me know.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9781103730201721}"

a week ago I was buying my prescription pills (sertraline and pregabalin) on a new pharmacy for the second time in a place where there is a lot of competition, so they cover any price from other pharmacies. seeing I was going to buy monthly, the clerk said if I needed some medication but don’t have a prescription he could “see what he could do for me”

I found out when CPS called me today to talk about her kids.  They told me she overdosed after injecting heroin.

I am so overwhelmed.  I want to help my sister, but I don't know where to start.  She won't admit that she has a problem.  She won't talk to our parents, and has sworn me to secrecy.  

CPS is asking me to check up on her daily from now on to make sure she isn't doing drugs, but I don't know anything about it.  I'm worried that I won't know what to look for, but worse than that I'm worried that this will happen again, but next time she'll die.

She insists this is the first time she has ever tried it, but now that I look back on some of the shit that has happened the last few years, I am pretty sure this isn't the first time she has overdosed.  The one thing I know for sure is that she isn't being honest with me.  She is trying to downplay this and make it go away, but I am worried about what will happen next if I can't help her.

How can I help my sister?  Are there any resources out there to guide me in the right direction?

If this is the wrong place for this, I'm sorry.  Any advice or guidance is appreciated.

Stupid freaking idiot ...1 month clean!,"First time poster and I’m on mobile so here goes.  This is the condensed version of my story. Currently I am a F/46 and had never touched an opiate until I was 38 years old. I definitely have an addictive personality. I smoked cigarettes for over 30 years, I’ve smoked weed since I was 14, my ex husband and I had an issue with cocaine at one point,  

For the most part, I had a normal, nice life. I met my first husband when I was 16. We were together for 6 years when we got engaged. We were together 9 years when we had our first child, a daughter. 3  1/2 years later we had another daughter. 13 months after that we got married. 7 years later we got divorced. In the 20 years we were together I worked a full time job, only stopping after I had my babies and going back to work when they were 2 months old. 
I went to all their school functions, helped with homework, cheered them at gymnastics and drove them to Girl Scouts. I kept a clean house, cooked balanced meals, sang my girls to sleep and gave them a happy, healthy childhood. 
My husband went to work and worked on his muscle cars. That’s it. We never did anything together other than a week at the shore every summer. I took the kids to all his family birthdays even when he was too coked up from the night before or was just going to bed when it was time to go. I bought all the Christmas presents for his mother and nieces and nephews and got cards for everyone’s happy event. He never came to any of my family things but that was ok, I really didn’t want him to. We lived separate lives. 

So in 2009, when he cheated on me and moved out, at first I was devastated. He was all I had known for 20 years, since I was 16! 
Then I found my first boyfriend who took my virginity on Facebook and we met up and it was like we were meant for each other. We instantly fell in love with each other  again and went wild. 
He gave me my first Vicodin and started me on the road to hell. I’m in no way blaming anyone for my actions. No one forced the pills down my throat and eventually, up my nose. But we were having so much fun it got out of control really quick. He was prescribed 5 mg Vicodin and gave me one to calm my nerves on our first date. 

I liked it. 

It progressed to getting the prescription upped to 15 mg oxycodone then buying 30s when that ran out. When they were no longer accessible he asked me if I ever did heroin. I said no, just the word was scary enough. He says it’s the same thing only cheaper. So we started doing bundles of heroin and having the time of our lives. 

My kids loved him. He actually did things with them. Took them to play tennis, shoot buckets at the driving range, bought them goats to take care of on his farm, we went camping, we went to myrtle beach, He was a plumber and made good money and spent it on all of us. 

At first, we only partied on the weekends when my ex had the girls. Then it started trickling into the weekdays. Then it was everyday to the point where we’d have 2 lines chopped up and ready for us when we woke up.  

My divorce was getting ugly. My ex was trying to take my kids from me and I was helping him with my drug abuse. I was forced to take a hair follicle and urine drug test for family court and after washing my hair with $100 shampoo I bought on the internet and flushing my system, I actually fucking passed and got custody of my younger daughter  
My older daughter wanted to stay with her dad because she missed her friends. We had moved upstate to get away from the temptations of cocaine and when we split up I came home and he stayed up there. 
So I had won custody of my youngest and was like ha ha fuck you ex! 

For 3 days. 

Then I got a DUI. I apparently nodded out and smashed into a car that was stopped at a red light and caused a chain reaction . No one was seriously hurt thankfully. 
I was taken to the hospital because I was too fucked up to refuse. Someone called my boyfriend so he came to the hospital. I guess this is a testament to how fucked up he was because instead of leaving my daughter play at the neighbors house and just telling them hey, I gotta go, OP was in an accident can daughter stay here, he picked her up to bring with him. 
In his Porsche.

That seats two. 

Idiot!

How the Hell I was supposed to get home, I have no idea. 
Anyway, apparently on the way there, someone side swiped his Porsche and took off so when he got to the hospital he spotted the cop who was there investigating my accident and proceeded to tell him all about the hit and run and the cop is like, have you been drinking? 
No, my bf doesn’t drink. Drugs? Just my prescription sir. 
Bam. Cuffed and stuffed and charged with DUI and endangering the welfare of a child (my child) and recklessly endangering another person. Plus he was on state parole from a drug manufacturing/delivery charge where he got 3 to 10 years (it was multiple charges for the same thing, selling cocaine). 

So, we both got separate DUI’s on the same day. He went to jail for 15 months and I fell apart and got worse. After a couple months of not eating (I lost about 30lbs) I was 5’9” and weighed about 115 pounds. I couldn’t keep anything down and resorted to drinking ensure for the nutrients.  
Eventually I started going over to my best friends house to sulk over there and she was meeting some guy she was fucking and drug me along with her. So I’m sitting on the couch in some strange house while my friend bangs this guy on a mattress in the basement. See, she was cheating on her husband and he was breaking up with his girlfriend but she was still living at his house so they would meet at his grandmother house that his brother and his girlfriend were living at. 
Eventually I got really close with the brothers girlfriend and started hanging out with her all the time. She had a script for perk 30s and sold them to me cheap. 

Meanwhile, the guy my friend was banging quickly lost interest in my clingy married friend and we started getting very close.He was  my best friend. We’d talk for hours and fuck for longer. I started having fun again while my fiancé was rotting in jail. Yes we got engaged on NYE. Anyway, friends with benefits turned into love and that’s the man I’m married to right now.  

Back to my DUI.  

After doing my 72 hrs for my DUI conviction, I got another DUI 10 days later. My parole officer told me to go to rehab or go to jail. So I went to rehab. There, they detox you with suboxone for 5 days. Then you move into the rehab part where you go to 8 classes a day, no exceptions. I ended up staying there for 17 days total until my insurance company kicked me out. I got out in the beginning of February 2012 and pretty much stayed clean until my sentencing in May because I didn’t want to withdraw in jail.  
Since I was also driving on a DUI suspended license, my state has a mandatory 90 day incarceration period. I was sentenced by the judge to house arrest but when I was screened beforehand I was told I didn’t qualify so I partied the night before my sentencing. So I took my piss test in jail knowing I was fucked and went back to my cell and fell asleep. 
Some time later, I was called to pack up, I was going home! I thought, holy shit I must’ve passed somehow! I got changed into my street clothes and called my sister to come get me. 
While I was waiting for her in the lobby, a CO comes over and crooks his finger at me, like, come here. I was like, what? He said, I don’t know but I was told to come get you. Turns out I didn’t pass my test after all. Let me tell you, that was one of the worst feelings in the world.  Back I went into my cell for the next 100 days. From May 16th to August 23rd.  My entire summer. It sucked. 

When I got out, I had 20 months of parole to get through and stayed clean the entire time. 
I lost my license for  4 1/2 years. 12 months for the first DUI, 18 months for the second, 12 months for driving in a DUI suspended license then I was required to get an ignition interlock license for 12 months. Back then, if you didn’t have a car registered to you, you could bypass getting the thing installed and just apply for the license and hold it for the 12 months but without driving because your not allowed to drive anything unless it has a breathalyzer installed, so that was another 12 months of no driving. 
Finally got my license back after almost 5 years of not driving. Life was good, I broke up with the guy who introduced me to heroin and met someone else.  I moved in with him after I got out of jail and we ended up getting married 2 1/2 years later and we were super happy. 

Sometime after I got off parole, I was talking to a girl at work about pills and my troubles with them and we both said how much we love them but how bad they are. Next thing I know, she’s offering me one and I’m taking it. Turns out she has a connection that has a script for 15 milligram oxycodone and I was back talking (well, snorting) pills again. It took a while but eventually I got hooked again and had to resort to heroin again. This time I found someone who had a Philly connection and we would drive down to philly 3 times a week at least. 

I hid everything from my husband. I would sneak out after he fell asleep and would be gone for three hours because I live an hour from  Philly.  I started spending so much money on dope that I was neglecting my responsibilities for my part of the bills and the electric would get shut off or the gas would get shut off. Then, after a midnight Philly run, my luck ran out. I got home around 3 am and there was a note stuck to my front door saying “Go sleep somewhere else, ASSHOLE”! I went in the back door and my husband jumped out of the darkness and confronted me about where I was. I told him the almost truth, that I went to go buy pills. I was afraid and ashamed to tell him I was buying heroin. He thought I was cheating on him which couldn’t be further from the truth. 
That was the beginning of a horrible time in our marriage. My husband started finding the zip tops that I would rip off of those tiny ziplock bags that I just couldn’t seem to get rid of, and kicked me out more than once. I’d be gone for a few days or a week and I’d come back telling him how sorry I was and I wouldn’t do it anymore and then he’d find something else. He started checking my phone and keeping track of my comings and goings. He didn’t believe anything I said even if it was the truth and I really couldn’t blame him.   

Finally, I had enough and went to a doctor to get on suboxone. But I couldn’t kick it. I had graduated from snorting it to booting it after one particularly horrible withdrawal episode and asked a friend of time to shoot me up. I blew off going to my next doctor’s appointment and started up again worse than before. 

My husband started hitting me because he was so disgusted by the fact that I was shooting up. We fought all the time. He has pushed me and kicked me while I was down, I have many pictures of my bruised body. 

2 years ago tomorrow, December 2nd, 2018, my best friend since 7th grade overdosed and died. Her death shocked and terrified me but it wasn’t enough to stop me.  3 weeks later, I overdosed on fentanyl laced heroin and was revived by my drug dealer with narcan.  The immediate withdrawal was so awful that I shot up the same shit that I just overdosed on, just less of it. I continued using knowing this had to end one way or another.  

Then, in February of this year (Super Bowl Sunday), my husband had heart attack. He was 47 and his artery was 100% blocked. It scared the shit out of both of us. We vowed to stop all the bullshit between us and try to work things out. We quit smoking and started eating healthier. I went back to the doctor and started suboxone again. 
 I stayed clean this time and started catching up on my bills and I was always home, I tried not to do anything to make him think I was going drugs again but the heart attack fucked him up mentally. He started drinking every day and in the past he was a happy drunk. But if something set him off... forget it. He was like a monster. 
Then on the night before our 4th wedding anniversary , we went out to dinner and had a few drinks. I didn’t want to stay long after dinner because it was a weeknight and we both had work the next day and we were going out again with my in-laws for an  anniversary dinner the next night so I wanted to leave and he wasn’t ready. I was not happy about that so he got pissed and called me a miserable bitch and was just plain nasty to me about it. 
So we finally leave and I’m driving us home and we get into an argument on the way home. By the time we got home we were screaming at each other and things got nasty. He started taunting me about going down to Kensington (a notoriously bad drug area of Philadelphia) and selling my ass for drugs (something I have never done no matter how sick I was) and I lost it. I grabbed him by the neck and dug my nails in as hard as could. He pushed me off of him and while I was crouched down on the floor he punched me twice in the back and broke two of my ribs. It fucking hurt like hell and I was screaming and crying and begging him to stop and to take me to the hospital but he screamed in my face to shut the fuck up, he didn’t care. I ended up driving myself to the hospital to make sure I didn’t puncture a lung because I know they really can’t do anything for broken ribs.  
They did an X-ray and sure enough, two of my ribs on my lower left back part of the rib cage were fractured. 

I was out of work for 2 weeks and eventually lost my job because it was a temp job and they were getting slow but I know they were trying to keep me as long as they could because they liked me but couldn’t justify it when I was out for so long. He was surprisingly remorseful (he wasn’t the type to apologize after hitting me like a lot of other abusers) and said he didn’t mean to hurt me (yeah right) but I was in so much pain, I couldn’t lay down, I couldn’t get up, I couldn’t breathe without being in agonizing pain. 

Eventually I gave up and went down to the city to get a bundle. It was a mistake I know, I numbed the pain so much that I ended up doing too much physical work and made it worse.  When I ran out and it wore off I was worse than before. But I sucked it up and got through the worst of it until they started healing. 

I stayed clean for a while, from about April 22/23rd to mid October so about 6 months. Things were getting back on track. I got a permanent job at the same place that let me go and things were going well until I ran into an old drug buddy who said he was trying to get clean but didn’t have insurance or the money to go to see a sub doctor so I took pity on him and sold him some of my subs. 

He was short on cash so he offered me a couple bags and stupid me took them. I had been thinking about getting high a lot lately and it just came along at the wrong time. Now in the 6 months since I had been clean, things changed dramatically. Heroin was no longer heroin but mostly fentanyl. I hate fentanyl. But I wanted to get high so I thought I was smart and could handle it so I would do teeny bits at a time. Before I would usually shoot a bag at a time I was always too scared to do more than that, so now I figured I better do just a quarter of a bag. So far so good. 
Until Saturday morning when I shot up and woke up on my kitchen floor after I overdosed. I woke up on my own and was fine for the rest of the day but I was shook. This shit is powerful! So the five bags I got off him lasted about 6 days. 

On Wednesday I was in the bathroom at work shooting up my customary tiny amount, but I must’ve put more in than I realized because the next thing I know, I’m standing at the sink washing my hands and I come to hearing someone saying my name over and over again asking if I’m ok. Long story short, someone called an ambulance and I had to go to the hospital. I tried to play it off that I was a diabetic and my sugar was low but they made me take a drug test the next day and I was fired. 

I was terrified to tell my husband because two days before this he booked us a cruise to the Bahamas in April for our 5th anniversary and I didn’t want to ruin everything. So I pretended I was going to work for 3 weeks until I got a new job and played it off that I wasn’t happy with my old job and wanted to quit. I got behind in my bills and had to borrow a couple hundred dollars off my friend and my bank account is overdrawn about 3 hundred dollars because everything was due at once and if I didn’t borrow the money and overdraw my account the water and electric would have been shut off. The water was shut off as a matter of fact but I got the money and had it back on before my husband got home from work. 

I feel incredibly guilty for lying to him but I feel it’s better than the alternative. Right now I’m working again and have been clean since the incident at work but I can’t get rid of this monkey on my back. I’ll tell you one thing though. This incident caused me to have absolutely no desire to ever do “heroin” again. I don’t want to die. And if I use again, I will die. This fentanyl is no fucking joke and that’s all you can get anymore. Real heroin doesn’t exist anymore. 

I have a long difficult road ahead of me. I have to deal with my recovery and my marriage. I love my husband to death regardless of what has happened between us. I know he had no right to put his hands on me and nothing I did can justify him breaking my ribs but I abused him in a way too by lying to him over and over for over a year about my drug use. 
I am still taking suboxone every day but I hope to free of that someday too. One step at a time though. Thanks for listening.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6993464827537537}"

I'm constantly bruised and looking for somewhere to hit it's awful. Ive tried rehab subs make me sick af I Don't know what to do. I should quit I need to I just didn't know if I can do it. I keep thinking about it and making myself nuts. I'm tired of busting my ass only to hand it all over to the dopeman and being broke all the time. I work to damn hard.i beat a 4 year bath salt / meth addiction about 3 years ago but this demon is way different. I can't stand being sick it fucks with me. I Don't even know why I'm posting this but you all are an inspiration to me that's for sure. Keep it up.

I used 3 times during one week close to the halfway point. Idk wtf is wrong w me and I wouldn't look for dope (I'm a lazy man to boot) but being where I can make one call makes it so hard.

I dont want to use but in this place there is another voice that is very loud and thinks shooting heroin is sort of funny and almost like my occupation in this geographical location. The voice was way, way quieter when dope was an hour long trip away.

It's almost killed me. At least a dozen times. I truly should be dead the ways I've woken up alone...very, very dead.

Yet I crave it and start just following my using pattern, thoughtlessly. Disregarding the help I've had.

Took 12mg of sub my first day of kicking because i had work after that went cold turkey. Physically i feel like im at 90%. Mentally im all fucked. In my head all the time, freezing up, lethargic, depressed, confused...all that shit. Guilty, shameful, less self loathing cuz im trying to give myself credit for getting this far.

I was in a fucked up place not long ago. Every shot i was taking felt like a suicide attempt. Knowingly doing fentdope bags and increasing the dose only to fall out and wake up a couple hours later. Dont know where that courage to get clean came from but it came and im thankful. Grateful i havent been waking up dope sick or having the first thought in my mind being what i can lie, cheat, steal, manipulate to get a needle in my arm.

Over 15 years of hard drug abuse i know its not gonna be easy and i dont expect it to be. But if ive been struggling all these years with only negative outcomes, what is one day of struggling towards the positive hurt?

I dont know why im writing this post. Maybe cuz i just want to get these thoughts out of my head and into writing. Cant hurt anything.

If youre struggling know youre not alone, and each one of us addicts has it in us to get better if we want. And for today i know for a fact that i wont be picking anything up.

I've been so insanely busy and have enjoyed it for the most part but right now even after a nice 3 days off seeing my family in nyc, I feel so overwhelmed and isolated. There is no way in hell I would relapse and let that demon win and ruin my life again but this shitty isolated feeling is one I have not really gotten in these last 8ish months being off dope. I hate it so much. R has been really fucking mean to me lately and i get that the holidays are rough for him and try to be understanding and accommodating but him calling me a dumb spoiled piece of shit cunt or something like that I can only block out so many times before it really does hurt me. Typically im happy to be busy and welcome the distraction but I have all this pressure from R to not work on final projects and study for final tests at school and instead clean the house... there's just no way I can win. Im just really sad and lonely and feel lost and need some support idk.  

All my bullshit aside; did everyone get through the holiday alright? I know this time of year can be rough for a lot of this but we're strong and with each other's support we got this. I really miss checking in every day, I think it was good for my mental health and I should try to start doing it again.  

Edit: I wasn't being fully honest in this post. Even at my most upset I have a tendency to try to make things sound better than they are or ""look on the bright side""... but in all honesty I have been really suicidal this morning. I would never want to leave my beautiful perfect dog or upset my parents, brother and best friends, but right now I just feel like it's all so pointless. I know I've felt this way many times before and always gotten through it but there's something about my current state of mind that makes me feel like I'm more at risk now than most other times.  

I feel stupid because it's not even like things are going so horribly in life, but I just get this feeling that no matter what I do or how hard I try I will be lonely and taken advantage of forever. I just really don't know what to do. I've gotten so good at quelling my emotions and/or distracting myself but for whatever reason those just do not seem like viable options right now.  

 R is sleeping right now, after spending all last night telling me how this house is a horrible pig sty and only a junkie would have such low standards as to live in it, and how he doesn't like me and I drive him crazy and I was a mistake. I don't get it- I do have an issue with cleaning my house, I am shitty at it and need to improve, and although it's definitely not looking ideal at the moment its nowhere near as bad as he thinks. Im just dreading when he wakes up and goes straight into continuing his tirade of beration from last night. It's so pathetic, I could kick him out if I wanted to as he doesn't contribute to bills or rent, but I'm just a sad lonely fuck who can't stand the idea of being alone and clings onto these dumb thoughts that because he's slightly less delusional than my exes and does at times have moments of clarity about his actions he will somehow change and this shit will never happen again.  

I'm so fucking sick of dealing with this; this is so far from the first time I've been in this situation and you'd think I woulda learned my lesson but no, the same addictive tendencies that led me to getting strung out keep me in situations where I overlook all the horrible shit for that tiny sliver of potential happiness. I stopped spinning the wheel, trying to fill the void inside of me with drugs and alcohol, and I thought that I stopped looking to others to fill that void as well, but obviously I was fucking wrong.  

 R will use my insecurities to try and pick me apart: ""I thought you were such a bad bitch but obviously I was wrong and that's what you want to come across as but actually you're just pathetic"". According to him showing any slightly emotional response to hours of being berated and belittled is pathetic and somehow reason for him to believe I duped him into thinking I was someone im not. No, I'm pretty sure 99% of people on this earth will have some sort of emotional reaction after being meticulously and methodically picked apart by someone who conveniently remembered all their worst insecurities, foolishly disclosed to them over the relationship. Im just sick of it. So sick of it. At this point he can't make me think im a worthless piece of shit. Im not, I know that. But he can definitely make me think that there is not happiness out there for me. That, well, maybe I am actually delusional and I am a horrible person to live with and put up with and that would be even sadder. But maybe easier to accept as a reason than just accepting that my previously mostly loving and supportive partner is now absolutely revolted by me and everything I do.  

 Im so sorry guys I was trying to keep my original post short but I just had to get all this out. I don't know what to do. Do any of you guys have any good coping mechanisms to get through a time when life is just beating you up? Or how you got through bad break ups without using? (Cuz as much as my stupid ass still doesn't want it to happen, that's likely what's gonna be in my cards). I really need some tools or support or just anything even just saying some textbook shit like ""don't worry it'll be okay"". I've tried so hard to get to the point where I can deal with absolutely everything in my life all by myself and I've gotten pretty good at not having to burden or bother others with my dumb problems but I really need to hear from a source outside myself right now, as all my head is doing is playing ping pong with whether I should kill myself or not.  

Thank you for reading if anyone did. Im sorry I can't keep my annoying mouth shut. Thank you guys for always putting up with my rambling on here. Y'all are the best 💜",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997729480266571}"
