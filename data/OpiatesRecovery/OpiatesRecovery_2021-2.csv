So I ~~have~~ **used to** **have** a dihydrocodeine addiction. I understand it's not very common in the states, but it's used fairly frequently in the UK for post-operative pain and the like, as a drug that's roughly 30-40% more potent than codeine alone. It also, unlike codeine, doesn't have a true ceiling dose, though eventually you will just start feeling sick and lethargic rather than good (ask me how I know).

My habit was bonkers - 1200mg at least once a day, sometimes twice, to very little effect. Basically pissing money down the drain. These last few days I've been motivated more by spite than anything. No more.

But I know two things - first, that most things I've read about rehab and detox strongly discourage cold turkey if you can help it. A taper is better. Obviously this is harder when you're not supervised, but I've been speaking to kind redditors and keeping myself in check. Second - bad withdrawal *will* just send me back into the arms of my DOC.

Codeine does nothing for me recreationally anymore and hasn't for a long time, so I've used that as a replacement and a taper, which has been working fairly well. Due to the ceiling effective dose of codeine being about 400-500mg, the first drop down was... a little grim. Nowhere near as bad as I've had when coming off CT, but I felt pretty unwell. Now it's been a few days and I'm dipping down about 100mg every day to good effect. Tonight's dose will be about 300mg.

But a little bit of my brain says ""just jump off, wuss. stop completely. suck it up. you deserve to feel like shit. and if you keep taking codeine all you're doing is continuing your habit and justifying it"". And I can't. Stop. These thoughts. I seriously spend several hours in the night staring at my codeine dose, knowing it's been long enough to take another bridging dose, feeling the hot flashes and cold sweats rising, the running dose, the pounding headache... but some part of me keeps ranting that I don't deserve to taper and it's without actual supervision, who knows *what* I might do. I certainly haven't been trustworthy with tapering with DHC in the past, but that's why I've been using codeine. I literally *cannot* get high on it anymore! But the thoughts go on and on. And I have to keep reminding myself. ""Dude, stop tormenting yourself. Stop crushing yourself under your own heel. It's hard, but that voice hasn't been proven right yet. You're still on codeine, and still going down. Hold on. Just hold on.""

&#x200B;

Am I right? Or should I give up the fantasy of being able to control my own taper? My worry is that partly I've been controlled by a lack of money and an unwillingness to hassle my friends for cash since I've already done that too much. But I get paid on the first. I *could* buy my DOC then. Could. But I wont. I can't. I really, really can't afford to. But I'm scared. I'm really scared that the nasty little voice is right and the moment I have the opportunity my willpower will snap and I'll purchase a shit load of DHC and I'll be right back where I started. I want to prove that voice wrong, I really, really do. But I don't know. I'm scared, to be honest. But I need to try, right?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992524981498718}"

## Long-term Sobriety

One of the many keys to the ever-changing lock of long-term sobriety is compartmentalization. The idea of compartmentalization is very simple however, this does not mean the application process is an easy one. The definition of compartmentalization is, ""the division of something into sections or categories.""(en.wikipedia.org) But, how does this relate to my sobriety? We've all heard the coined term ""one day at a time"", clear use of compartmentalization. Many, if not all of us, can not imagine our whole life without the use of drugs or alcohol. However, this is possible by using compartmentalization to break forever into one day at a time. Some addicts can go 24 hours without getting high or drunk, this is how they must break it down. For the addictions and alcoholics who cannot abstain from using or drinking for 24 hours must break this concept down into smaller pieces, I will not drink for 6 hours. There are those of us who cannot even imagine 6 hours and must be broken down even further, I will not drink for one hour. The true success of this method comes when you can realize you ONLY have to not drink for 24 hours. Sure, you can drink tomorrow but just not for the next 24 hours. The secret sauce, if you will, is that by the time that 24 hours ends you reroll the dice and a new 24 hours commences.

## Large Tasks

Though this concept seems simple and counterintuitive it has been proven again and again to work. Not only can you use this for sobriety you can use this for day-to-day hassles and mundane activities. Say I have to clean the entire house, an enormous and daunting task. Naturally, as addicts and people in general we will procrastinate and leave this task for the very end. The solution to this problem is apparent but not easy. You can make this daunting and intolerable task seem simple and easy through the use of compartmentalization. If you have 10 tasks to do start with one. Tell yourself, ""I will do one task and then I will be done."" By the time you are down with the first task, you have initiated that spark of motivation. If you don't trust me try it for yourself. About 80% of the time if I have a big task and I tell myself I will do one thing I end up completing the entire task. Completing that first task will give you the motivation you need to complete the subsequent tasks. This works incredibly similar to your sobriety. You develop a 'streak' of sobriety time and you've already completed one day, why not try to get another day. These days string together and before you know you're sitting there wondering how the hell you got a year.

2021-02-26 13:48:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/lt4qog/oof_big_oof/,Oof. Big oof.,"This seems to happen a lot. When I try to cut myself off or vastly reduce my usage to taper off, I start getting incredibly unhappy and weepy. It's so fucking stupid but I feel like I'm losing a friend when I try to kick the habit. Something that's been there for me when nothing else helped.

Like a lot of people I ended up on opiates originally for pain. I was also diagnosed with clinical depression and stressed in my final year of university. I still remember it so vividly, taking 60mg of codeine and I felt *incredible*. Like all my problems and bad feelings were just gone, all my fears and misery following me around, gone.

I guess my usage really went into addict territory the first year out of university. I just. I felt like I had no one. My flatmate, as much as I love her, wasn't there at all. I saw and spoke to no one. My best friend had to leave the country, which felt like cutting off a limb. My referral to a psychiatric nurse was in permanent limbo. I just. Wanted someone to be there and tell me it would be ok. But I had no one so I relied on drugs instead. It blunted my feelings. Opiates are great for physical pain, but this was definitely emotional pain.

And once it started, I just kept isolating myself. I'd stay in my room all day. I'd only leave to pharmacy-hop for pills. Even as my depression started getting treatment and I started having a social circle, it was too late. By that point my poisonous ""friend"" of my DOC was embedded in my life, and I was sooo sure, as addicts are, that I could stop if I wanted to, I just didn't want to.

You'd think almost killing myself with paracetamol overdose would have changed things, but no. Went straight back to it. Just kept on and on and on and then when the pandemic hit and I got access to other ways of getting my DOC cheaply and in plentiful amounts, my usage spiraled. I suffered my first real ""withdrawal"" over last easter weekend, and I wanted to fucking die. And it scared me, because it meant I was truly dependent, not just emotionally but physically. More than ever, I would have to plan around things to make sure I had enough to keep me feeling well. I got so sick and tired of it all, nevermind the lying to my friends and family.

And now I'm just... I don't know. I'm not fully clean yet as I'm using a low dose of codeine to bridge and taper down. But I just feel like I've wasted so much, and at the same time I want to go back and time and yell ""why didn't anyone ever check on me? why was I so alone in this period? why did things have to be that way?""

I don't have any answers. Sometimes life just is. But I'm feeling my actual emotions right now and it feels like I've been shanked in the gut. I feel both empty and hopeless, like I'll never crawl out of this hole I've dug myself. I know I need to keep trying, I know it wont be fixed by itself.

It has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do. The whole reason I started using was because my mom had battled lung and brain cancer when I was a teenager and ended up beating it. She had a lot of health struggles and I started using because of her various health issues almost 2 years ago. I picked up meth and heroin while in college due to her health problems and eventually had to take a break from college. She got better but I continued to struggle until about a year ago I finally said enough is enough after her finding me 3 separate times when I overdosed. 

I have been doing great and wonderful, but out of nowhere she got pneumonia and aspirated on some food. She‚Äôs now in the ICU on a ventilator and they don‚Äôt think she can overcome this infection in her lungs. Her body isn‚Äôt strong enough to recover and they want me to come in and talk about end of life care. They have to start taking extraordinary circumstances to keep her alive in about 3 more days if she doesn‚Äôt get better.

I‚Äôm an absolute mess. I have always taken care of her my entire life and now I could be losing her. I have family flying in. I have a wonderful girlfriend who has supported me in my recovery more than I could ever ask for. My family is here for me too. I want to use more than ever right now and if I was using, I would probably be going overboard and have another OD. I‚Äôm just not ready for this, I‚Äôm beating myself up for wasting time not spending time with her while I was using, things I made her go through. I just wish I had more time.

I was a heavy opiate addict(heroin,fent,carfent) , benzo(xanax)  and crack for 4 years. I used to speedball and Id go through half a breezo a day(brick). I got clean 2 months ago getting off benzos, heroin, crack all at the same time.  I guarantee getting off all these substances is literally one of the hardest thing to do in the world. Ive been clean ever since, and right now i don't even have a single thought during the day of using nor do I even think about the drug. Im focussed on other things, hobbies, my job, and its something extremely new for me that I don't even have a thought about it. I was at a NA meeting the other day and I said my clean date. I later proceeded to mention I do smoke still. And someone shouted out your not clean. The people that came up to me and told me that they were offended that I smoke weed and call myself clean were at the meeting because they struggle with ""weed addiction"" . I actually find it extremely offensive that they are going to say that when stopping to smoke weed even after 10 year( ive done it many times) is literally a walk in the park. Not even. Comparing the two literally made me want to slap them(would never do that)thinking about all the shit I went through to get clean.. I know everyone has their own struggles. But it absolutely blew my mind that they said that.

They started recommending Rehabs for me to go to for my ""pot addiction"".  Listen I word a hard 70 hours a week.  I was able to get off crack ,heroin,fent/carfent, and xanax all at the same time.  And ive been able to stay clean for more than 2 months.. How are they going to telll me I need help because I smoke 3-4 times a month on the weekends when I am off to relax and sleep.  It is 100% my choice I havent smoked in 2 weeks not because Im trying because I simply don't have the time right now.  Some other people told me too that weed withdrawlls were worse than theyre xanax or dope withdrawls and I call 100% BULLSHIT",58,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990757703781128}"
2021-02-24 15:34:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/lrmrl6/looking_for_someone_to_hold_me_accountable/,Looking for someone to hold me accountable,"Let me preface this by saying that I know this is a big ask, and I'm not necessarily expecting anyone to be able to do this for me. I'm just at my wits end, feeling deeply depressed and need to yell into the void a bit.

I need someone to hold me accountable. I need to have someone who will ask if I've been using too much, someone I can talk to when I'm struggling with my urges. I've been an addict pretty much since I finished my university course 8 years ago, and I know I'm just... wasting my life. It hurts to acknowledge it, but it's true. I've been letting all my hopes and dreams slip away because it's easier and more comfortable just to be high on my own. I have moments of clarity where I realise I could easily waste my entire life if I don't change. I can't bear that thought, but I'm struggling so much even just to not binge constantly.

Ever since the pandemic started, my usage has become far worse. I used to use dihydrocodeine every second day, sometimes a little longer gap than that. But the pandemic happened. Lockdown happened. I lost the job I loved, lost contact with my coworkers who were all wonderful, supportive people. Had to stay with my parents for a while which I have a... rough relationship with. All these factors meant I started using every day, heavily. But honestly, even typing this, it feels like an excuse. I can't even understand myself anymore. I know it's harmful. I know I've basically had my life on pause for years. I know I'm getting worse. I know I don't even get all that much enjoyment out of it anymore. But I can't stop.

So I guess I'm trying to be realistic about where I'm at. What I want to do in the short term is cut down my usage. I want to be able to space out my doses more, at least get back to once every second day, maybe every third day. I want to get there and then slowly, slowly claw my life back and get off it forever, eventually. I know tapering is hard at the best of times, and we always tell ourselves ""I'll just do this! I've got my plan, no problem!"" and it never works. For me, I think it's because there's no one to hold me accountable. Who's going to know if I break my rules and take more than I'm ""supposed"" to? There's no one to talk to when I'm craving. I can't tell any of my friends around me. Nobody knows, and I can't reach out. Honestly, I felt utterly alone for a long, long time. It's only recently that I've found other people in the same situation as me.

So I'm asking for help. Begging, really. I know it's a big ask. I know there's not really any reason anyone should invest their emotional energy in helping me. I can only throw this out into this subreddit and hope.  I need someone I can chat to and someone who will check in with me on the regular. Someone who will know if I don't stick to the rules I'm trying to set myself. Someone who understands how miserable it can be. Someone who understands and can offer a little kindness, and remind me of why I've set these limits, these goals, when my thoughts are clouded with the need to be high. Honestly, I was scared to bring this to this subreddit, because it's not a ""serious"" opiate. It's ""only"" dihydrocodeine, and there are people struggling with so much worse. It made me scared to bring this here, but I desperately need to try and reach out.

I want to be better. I want to try harder. But I don't think I can do it alone. It's no one's job to babysit me to make sure I don't do idiotic things, I know, so I'm writing this post with no real expectations. I can only hope that someone might have the emotional strength, time and space to talk with me and hold me to account when I slip or break my own self-imposed rules. Or at least have a sympathetic ear. I feel so isolated, and it feels impossible to claw my way out of this pit on my own.

Thanks for reading. Even if no one has the time or energy to help, I appreciate all these support and recovery subreddits and I appreciate the feeling that I'm not totally alone. Stay safe, and take care.

Let me know if not. This question is for my husband who is currently trying to get off of opioids. He initially got on them for herniated discs in his back, sciatica, etc., and this escalated into over a decade of abuse. The thing is, even if he stays off of the pills, he is still in a lot of pain. At one point he was off of them for over a year but the pain was making him crazy and he started using again. Those of you who have been through this, is there anything that can help? He doesn't want back surgery because it hasn't helped anyone in his family (the back problems are, in part, hereditary, and also from a couple of car accidents when he was younger) and his relatives just ended up back on opiates after their own surgeries (which will just put him right back where he is). He has also tried physical therapy in the past and says that was not helpful either. He has been a chronic pot smoker for years and that does not seem to help his pain.

I know at least some of this is him wanting the pills, specifically, and looking for a reason to take them. Another part is the depression that he is prone to anyway that seems to accompany withdrawal. But I also know his back pain is legit and I know there are a lot of really awesome people on this board who have gone through what he is going through and have come out on the other side. Looking for suggestions from people who have lived this. Thanks in advance.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973760843276978}"

I had 2 children with a girl that i loved, life was good. We worked, had a car and everything we needed but everything changed when i got into an accident. We had a babysitter for the night so we went out. It was om the way home a car hit us head on going down the highway, both doing 55 so the impact was quite severe. I dont remember it at all to this day. I remember waking up in a ditch puking and trying to find my right eye because i had been ejected from the vehicle and fractured my skull. I remember the helicopter landing. I remember waking up the next day and everyone telling me how lucky i was to be alive. It was crazy though because i wasnt in any pain. I actually walked laps around the icu because i felt so great. The hospital had me on so much dope and i really didnt know any better. I was able to go home the next day and noone could believe it. I had fractured my skull and i wasnt sulposed to be able to remember things. I lost my kneecap and it had to be sowed back on. I separated mt entired shoulder from the arm but i was fine. They gave me my medication to take home and that was the beggining of my hell. Me and my now ex girlfriend flew thru the prescriptions because it made us numb and motivated and helped us get everything accomplished and why not because we needed it right? Family started telling us we needed to stop taking it, it would turn into something else. We didnt need that negativity and who were they to judge us. It went from pills to heroin because its two of us and its cheaper. Then from snorting to shootinf because it will stretch the money. They were the first things we lost. Thwn the house. Then the jobs. Then we used each and every person who gave us a chance to until they couldnt take anymore and it was on to the next. Eventually we lost everything and sadly it wasnt until i lost my children that i rwally had to ask myself what the fuck i was doing. Sitting at a salvation army with her under a bridge withdrawaling with nowherw to go, no one to even call...trying to figure out how it got so bad in a year. I needed to find a way to get my life back. My mom was an addict, she killed my stepdad and grandpa for insurance money for drugs and i grew up in foster care because of it. I promised i wpuld never be that person, how could someone love a drug more than there childrwn. I didnt have an answer but i knew it was possible because if you love it morw than yourself then what is going to top that. I figured she must feel the same sitting next to me so i asked her....she said we could get a front from someone she met while she was bonding me out and we could do day labor and one of us get a room and one of us get a half of g and we could be good. I had to leave. My first time getting clean, i think i was so mentlly and emotionally done that i didnt even withdrawal that bad. Like i had some chills but norhing like what i used to experience when i couldnt get some or i was waiting on the plug. I guess it is mental to an extent. I started at a conpany that knew what i was going through, the man paid for a hotelfor me for a month, took me to visit my children and attend classes and to my court dates. I met a girl. She accepted me with all my flaws and all my past and she was perfect and i didnt k ow what she was doing with me. She went and took classes and fingerprints and background check to be in my childrens life. She got pregnant. We got a place and things were looking up. Then one day someone offered me a lortab. I didnt realize the danger that litrle weak pill would cause. I mean its a glorified tylenol right? It wasnt enough, i started using injuries from my accident as an excuse to buy pills and within a month i was hiding in the bathroom shooting up heroin. She knew something was wrong but not what but she wanted to help. Anytbing she could do. I told her it was the doctors fault because they wouldnt give me anything. I failed a drug test and violated my probation. They put a warrant out. She waz 6 months pregnant and i was in the bathroom again, shooting up with money from thw pawnshop because her grandmothers ring didnt matter to me. I told her i would turn myself in after the baby came. He came. We left rhe state. I told her i wanted to move and get her situated and then i would save money and turn myself in so i had a lawyer. It was a 6 hour drive and i was taking the trip for another reason. I had to stop. We got to georgia with our newborn baby and i proceeded to break her heart. I told her i had been using, lying, manipulating...i wasnt tired from work, thats called a nod. My eyes, yeah not from beibg tired. Marks on my arms, not from trimming bushes. She cried. She spent hours researching what i was going through and how she could help. She took care of me for 7 days, while she breastfed a newborn and didnt barely sleep because i was doung karate in the bed all night. I finally got sleep though and held our son sober for the first time. What was i doing? Had to stop i told myself. I didnt last a month. Pressed 30s were taking over and oh my how i loved them. I mean i broke my ribs because i got into a fucking bar brawl and i literally couldnt breathe. I told her i would jist buy one and break it into pieces and thats all. She coyld even hold it. She said it wouldnt cause me to go through my addiction again right? Oh no, definitely not. Convinced her it didnt work orally, had to snort it. She didnt know that if i had taken more than a qaurter of this pill i would have oded because these were ztronger than the heroin i was getting. That 1 turned into 5 and there i was again. I ended up fucked up one night arguing with a neighbor and the next day family services was at our door. We need to go take drug test or they were gonna remove our son. She went. She asked when i was going. Told her i couldnt because of the warrant, told her i waould go turn myself in. They took our son. I held her as she cried for hours. I told her i was done. She told me please because she couldnt do this anymore. She loved me so much but i had to stop. I got on a bus to go to tuen myself in and she got our son back after about a week. My aunt picked me up and sine i was turning myslef in why dont i try this fire ass boy shes been getting. She had a shot ready to go. Told my girl i waz gonna hold off on turning myself im so i could send her some money from working. A month later she had sent me 1500 dollars. I would western union 200 as soon as her check hit. I got pulled over driving at 3 am because i didnt have headlights. Called her and told her beforw the cop took me to jail. She waz happy. Finally you can get this over with and come be with your family. Called her again the next day from jail. Told her how sick i was. Told her what id been doing. She had a feeling but didnt want to believe it. Tbis was the last straw. Just tale the time in court, no probation and come home to our family. I would. I promised. I stayed up for almost 14 days straight this time because of the restless legs. I had court 30 days later. Judge said you can do 6 motnhs in county with 4 months served already or i can reinstate your probation and send you home today. I had nowhwere to go but i toom the probation. What the fuck is wrong with me!?! Seriously. I called my aunt to pick my up from jail. How could that make sense to anyone. I told my girl they didnt give me an option. I literally violated within a week and ran around on the run for like a month before i got caught but this time it got bad. Never tried ice but my aunt did some and offered me some. Sure. Why not. Idk if it is me as a person or my genetics but the first 12 hours im good. And then i get the worst psychosis i have ever seen or heard of anyone getting. I cant sleep for days. I dont eat or drink because its poisoned. I pick worms out of my skin. Lol fun huh? I called the cops and told them to come because my aunt was trying to kill me. Not before i callwd my girl and told her how much i loved her and i was sorry for everything. Went to jail again. I woke up 3 days later and her number was blocked on the jail phone. Had someones girl call her. Leave her the fuck alone. Shes done. I couldnt believe it. Tried to call 3 tines a day for 30 days. Nothing. I finally did it. She left. Judge took his glasses off and laughed when i said i needed probation. Hahaha he said you know i can give you 5 years right? Im gonna give you a chance though. I got happy. 18 months in tge department of corrections. Heart stopped. Prison? Fuck. Wrote her a letter. She answered the phone a few days later. She cant be with me but she will keep me informed about our son. My heart broke as i spome to her every few dyas over thos 18 months. Shes dating, shes happy, and im here. I had everything and threw it all away. I told her i would win her back. She said never. Broke her too many times. She said i needed to get out and go to rehab before i could see her or our son. I have a month left and maybe she will pick me up and i can stay with one of our good friends and prove i can be apart of our sons life. Stop asking her to be with me because its not gonna happen. She picks me up and buys me clothes and a phone and we get a hotel. Different beds but still. Im sober. Im happy. This is what i beegged for in prison, what i never thought i would have again but i do. I can stay with her. Were not together but she will help me. Then one night i dont have to sleep on the couch, boom shes mine again. Longest ive ever been sober. Ive really changed. I got out june 2 2020. In February of 2021 someone offered me a pressed 30 and i have no clue why i fucking took it but i did. And then i did two more. Shes not stupid anymore, what the fuck is going on....i tell her the truth. She says she is not fucking doing this again. I did boy for about 2 weeks. Trying to find subs. Knowing what ice did to me, i fucking got offered some and did a shot. I experienced the same thing. Im eith her and my son running around the house tweaking. Shes 7 months pregnant. Our son is 2. Shes given up so much for us. I told her everything finally. Asked her to take me to get suboxone. I havent slept in 3 straight days. I got my suboxone yesterday. I finally slept last night. Waking up today i couldnt believe it. What am i doing. I have to be able to say no because running into substances is likely. I am happy where our lifes are...we have our own place and a car and jobs and it was starting to slip away in 2 weeks. Like i was at the pawn shop everyday. We dont have a tv right now. My sons ipad is gone. Im on a piece of shit android because my iphone didnt matter. How do i make sure this never happens. I know for sure that even if i use one more time i will lose everything.

I just wanted to share my experience with the sublocade shot because it has been a true life saver for me and I think it could help a lot of people who have been a slave to subs/opiates. 

I‚Äôm a 32 y/o medical professional who has struggled with an oxy/herion problem for over ten years. At one point I was on 80 mg of methadone for two years- I did a blind taper (they reduced my dose slowly over 7 months and never told me when they dropped it). When I got to 16 mg I switched over to subs because I was in grad school and couldn‚Äôt go to the clinic in the mornings anymore. I started on 16 mg subs and tapered myself to 8 mg. Over a year I dropped to 2 mg. When I tried to go lower than 2 mg, I relapsed on H. After that, I had a downward spiral for 2 years. I went to rehab 3 times and tried the vivitrol shot. It made me depressed and I used on top of . After two OD‚Äôs and two lost jobs I went to rehab again. I did a methadone detox and a few weeks later they started me on subs and I received the sublocade shot (300mg) before I left. 

This shot had been a miracle for me. I‚Äôm even all day long and have minimal cravings. I won‚Äôt lie, the shot does burn but it‚Äôs tolerable and the stinging goes away shortly after.  I‚Äôve received 4 shots so far (2 300mg, 2 100mg) I was afraid that the 100 mg shot was going to put me in withdrawal and leave me vulnerable for relapse but it didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve had no symptoms of withdrawal. At the end of each month I have noticed that I have more thoughts of using and mild cravings but it‚Äôs manageable. 

I‚Äôve been able to achieve 5 months clean and this is the longest time I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm not sure when I will stop getting the shot. I want to be on it for at least a year so I have some substantial clean time under my belt.  However, I have read a lot of posts about people stopping after shot 6 and having little to no withdrawal afterward.  I feel like there is not a lot of info about the shot and I just wanted to get the word out to those who are stuck and enslaved to sub pills/strips or other opiates.

I did prostitute myself. I am a gay guy. I sold my body and nudes for drugs. Yes it is a thing and it gave me a lot of shame to come with it. Got meth and laced heroin out of it and a dealer. And in a few hours when I am sitting outside a starbucks for 6 hours I am going to reply to your guy's comments. I really appreciate you guys and your encouragment. But here's the update, if you have read what's up with me I am just jorunaling and getting it all out there. My last post says a lot about this. I am homeless going to rehab with no money and no insurance but, it will be okay. I just found out I was going to rehab. I am probably going to try to get on methadone/suboxone at least for a week or two and try not to relapse in this place I am going too. Haha I am from the suburbs so I am not used to any of this. I mean I grew up nice. But the childhood abuse from my dad beating me and raping my mom and I don't know shit happened. When I started to get in depth with this trauma it hurt so bad. This was almost a year and a few months into recovery. Which lead to me going back out for months which is where I am now :)... I was so close to killing myself I had a pile of heroin in front of me around a gram and I was going to do it all in one line. I didn't shoot up. But I was about to kill myself, knife to my throat I didn't want to lie to my friends and family anymore. That is when I got honest to my sponsor that I had been lying to for 3 months. Sorry jumping all over the place. I am still in a teen and sober program called and APG. The only way I can get back to living with people within the APG is to go to this rehab and hope for the best while I'm in it. Have to detox, need to get sober and stay sober. Sure I have a lot of willingness and motivation but that dosen't change the fact that I lied to everyone around me, getting high for 3 months. Y'know haha, but the counselors said that was the only way I wasn't going to be homeless, and have people to live with. So i'm ready. I don't want to be homeless in downtown houston. I mean I could but that wouldn't help me get sober. Gave my sponsor my phone and I'm ready to detox and go to rehab. I have been to rehab 3 times, in the adolecent unit but this is going to be a lot different, very different. But I need that. Whatever gets me sober. Okay welp I don't know when the next update is going to be but probably whenever I get out.

Now I‚Äôm reaching out for any advice on the only parts of withdrawal that make it feel almost impossible for me to make it through.. 
‚Ä¢MAJOR anxiety
‚Ä¢restless leg syndrome (arms hands and legs)
Now a little background for info:
I‚Äôm tapering off rather successfully before pulling the trigger I‚Äôm down to just 2 bags a day and I‚Äôm planning to try to get down even further before doing so. (110 pound 27 year old female)
I‚Äôve always suffered with anxiety so I luckily enough have a Xanax prescription that i use very rarely on really bad days which I plan to use to assist me during this. I‚Äôm hoping this will help me sleep through a lot of this as well.
Now the main problem for me with all of this is the RLS it drives me insane as it keeps me from getting any sleep and makes me even more anxious possibly due to the lack of sleep. 
I have my boyfriend by my side for support and he‚Äôs one of the strongest people I know so I‚Äôm 100% positive I‚Äôll make it through I just truly fear the days of rls and cold/hot flashes because I know exercise is helpful but with the cold sweats getting up and moving around is nearly impossible.

About 4 years ago this habit ramped up a little and I started doing it weekly, around 150mg, then over the past two years due to personal issues it went up more, hovering around 210mg. 

No real issues at this level though. Then last year, due to COVID lockdown it became a bit of a problem. I found myself doing it twice a week at times, and in higher amounts, up to 400mg and sometimes combining it with DHC and doing it on consecutive days. Added to this, I started feeling *horrific* about 3 days later, physically ill, diarhhea, horrible mood, anxious, wanting to take it more often to stop feeling like this. 

Over this period, I was also doing 300mg Pregablin (and benzos a few years ago but started to hate those, so quit with no issues). Again, over the past year or two, I started to do it twice a week. Never really noticed any major negative after effects from it though and it helped my social life so this was less of an issue but I'd rather not being it so often. 

A few weeks ago I decided to sort this out. I don't think I can go cold turkey. I like opiates to relax, like a glass of wine, but I figured it was impacting negatively on my life and I needed to do something. I started halving the amounts I took, so 150mg of codeine on a Saturday then 90mg midweek. (And 300mg Preg on a Friday and 150mg midweek). I found this worked really well. I got enough of a buzz to enjoy it and didn't get the urge to redose, plus the negative after-effects were a LOT less harsh. Still a bit unpleasant but manageable. 

I think/hope when lockdown ends in my country this summer I'll be able to cut down further, hopefully  down to once a week. The aim is to reduce the codeine down to 90mg too. 

I know this is codeine and it's seen as a weak opiate but if anyone else has a problem with it at the moment, it might be work a try. I don't think I have a massively addictive personality and I feel a lot better mentally and physically from reducing my intake. I guess it's a kind of low-key taper with no real end fixed. 

But are there issues with this method? If there are pitfalls to be aware of, do let me know. I am concerned that both these drugs are floating round my system for more than half the week and that my body hasn't had zero amounts of either for a long time. But how worrying is this?",2,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 2}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9838734269142151}"

Was at an AA meeting with an addict today who said she relapsed on day 3 everytime. Lemme tell y'all what's going through my head. I had 6 months sober at 17 then fucked that shit up. I'm in an APG which i don't know if you guys know what that is. Basically a teen sober group that helps drug addict kids get sober. Crazy Right? In AA meetings I always hear "" When I was your age I wish I got sober so i didn't fuck all of my family up and lose people"" I have lost people to overdoses, drug deals gone bad. I don't know why I am saying that. In the past three months shit has gone south. The person I was living with in spite of my 6 months sober, my program helped me live with someone ""hosting"" as they call it in the apg. Well I fucked that shit up, stole from my good friends mom kpins, codine, adderall vyvanse. A bunch of shit. Got tramadol too. That was the beginning. Then I moved home from ""hosting"" continuing to go to AA meetings fucked up, show up at my APG high, and was lying to my family. This is where shit went south. I bought from a dealer who used to be a friend of mine. A day later she overdosed on xannax. My friend in the APG who i've known for 4 years out of highschool was best friends with this girl. I have to make a living ammends for that. Coke and Oxy's, was it worth it? fuck no. Then I proceeded to prostitue myself for nudes to try and get meth and meetup with people who did meth and had heroin. I found a guy who was going to have sex with me for meth Luckily he gave me his dealer so I didn't have to do that. Also I had sex with a man for some alcohol who was 31.. I am 18. Anyway yeah shit went really south. Speedballed for weeks, my job knew something was up. Stopped the meth, was buying a gram of fentnyl laced heroin every chance i could get, twice a week I don't even know if that's a lot. I've had nobody to talk to about this shit. Welp the fent made me paranoid, threatened to kill someone in a whataburger because I thought I was getting jumped. Was going to overdose, had a knife to my throat.

Will the kratom just take the edge off or nearly eliminate it? Idk if it'll be similar to being on methadone or subs where you feel ok physically after finding the proper dose. I don't want to keep taking more waiting for it to do more than it will.  

And does it cause any precip withdrawal?? Idk if waiting until morning is enough or if I need to further into first.

My tolerance went up year after year. Was prescribed 3 @ 30mg oxy for the last year. I would bump that amount too so I ranged between 90 and 120 mg a day.

Was in hell for 7-8 days- twitching and restless leg all night, diarhea for 4-5 days. Finally back in the same bed with my wife after 9 days of night hell.

My big question- I thought by now I would be feeling somewhat normal. I have this anxiety or buzzing, uncomfortable feeling all of the time. I have to eat all of the time to take the edge off. Any time frame feedback on when I may feel ""normal"" in terms of everyday life? Another week? Month? I did a cold turkey on my own because my Dr retired. Now I know why people ramp down over a long period. I have ramped down with lower doses before but this has come as a surprise to me. Its always hell the first week but then I thought I would return to a place where I could just ""be"" without all of the anxiety and crazy feelings and lack of energy.

2. 100ct lyrica @ 150mg
3. 100ct trazodone @ 150mg

When I was previously in rehab, I believe I was given 0.1mg of clonidine twice a day, maybe a little more PRN. I was also given trazodone for sleep, and found it worked quite well for this purpose (I did not get the dreaded ""Iron Dick"" - Priapism - fortunately). 

I plan to use a similar regiment this time around, however I also want to use Lyrica as needed, as I found during my suboxone taper that it's incredibly effective.

**Can anyone tell me how long (and at what maximum dose) I can use Lyrica for without risk of developing dependence?** I am lucky in that I do **not** enjoy it's effects (makes me feel drunk), but it does work very well for withdrawals. I just want to ensure that I don't end up with another dependence.

I was thinking of dosing it at maximum 300mg daily for the first 5 days, and then tapering down to 0 over the next 5 days... does anyone feel this will still put me at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms? 

I know to be careful combining clonidine and lyrica since they both lower BP. Thanks in advance!

Not able to communicate, her phones dead etc. Staying at the trap all night just sounds like trouble.  She doesn‚Äôt want me to meet her friends, because they are mostly users, and the lifestyle choice makes them come in and out of her life -  ‚Äúfleeting‚Äù in her words. 

I am a recovering alcoholic so all I do is smoke weed. I also struggle with codependent... I come from a family of addicts, we just love our codependent relationships lolz. üôÑ

We talk pretty openly about her addiction. I know that she is a grown person and makes her own choice, she enjoys drugs. She is also one of the funniest, smartest and strongest people I have ever met. I just wish I could support her more. We live together and I keep a pretty quiet sober house. I think she is selling the oxy and doing h again. Or both. I haven‚Äôt asked her yet cause Im not sure what I will be told. Maybe the truth, maybe not ...I know I have told some doozies to cover how bad my addiction actually was.

A few months ago I went to rehab for the first time (I‚Äôm 24, F) for alcohol. I never had a serious drug problem before but was a raging alcoholic and it was destroying my life. While I was in rehab I met someone and we got romantically involved (terrible idea,I know) and he was a heroin and fent addict. I left rehab and let him move in with me for what was supposed to only be two weeks but turned into more than a month. We relapsed together on benzos and I‚Äôve never loved anything more, I still haven‚Äôt drank since leaving rehab, I‚Äôve barely even thought about alcohol now that I remember how much I love benzos and know where to get them. I live in SF and he taught me how and where to pick up, I wish I could erase that information from my mind. The last few months of my life have been a complete blur and my life spiraled completely out of control. We were doing meth, adderall, so much Xanax and kpins and methadone, etc. 
it finally ended when I decided to try fentanyl for the first time. My life was completely falling apart, i had isolated myself from my friends and family, destroyed my relationship with my roommates, was lying to everyone in my life, and in this abusive relationship I couldn‚Äôt seem to leave. I had spent all my money on drugs for us both and on stupid shit like getting my car towed because i was high on benzos. I felt so completely hopeless to the point where i wanted to die. So it wasn‚Äôt exactly a suicide attempt, but it felt like it. Like if i died I wouldn‚Äôt have cared. 
Every step of the way from driving to the block, to getting out cash, to picking up,  i kept saying it was a bad idea, I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt stop it. I know how fucking dangerous fent is but he kept reassuring me that he knew how much to give me. It took so little for me to OD. We had been hitting it all night in this cheap motel room until the early morning and I was fine, high but itchy and nauseous, I was kind of relieved I didn‚Äôt like it very much. 
Then, right before I was going to try and go to bed, I asked to hit it again. It was complete darkness after that. I came to surrounded by EMTs after he narcanned me and they took me on a stretcher without my wallet or phone or shoes or a jacket. I‚Äôve never been so scared. I was heaving and throwing up and in what felt like violent withdrawals. I kept asking them if I was dying and to hold my hand. I have a cousin addicted to fent and I always promised myself no matter what I‚Äôd never touch it.  I‚Äôve never been more sick, I couldn‚Äôt take two steps without fainting or vomiting. They kicked me out of the ER after monitoring my vitals for an hour without shoes or clothes or any of my things. The guy i was with said he‚Äôd meet me there but never came. 
I feel so empty now. Im not religious at all but i saw no light, it just felt like a warm hug or falling asleep. I thought after that experience i was done, that I‚Äôd have a stronger will to be sober or at least stay alive, but i relapsed again not even a week after with the same person because it felt like he was the only person I had left in the world. 
I‚Äôm exhausted even trying to tell this story. I am back in rehab (day 1) now but I feel so much more lost and hopeless than before. How do I build myself back up from here when I‚Äôve destroyed every relationship in my life and only developed a worse addiction than what I started with? How do I get rid of all of this guilt and shame and deep fucking loneliness? It feels like I‚Äôve fallen so far that I might not find a way out again. All of these painful memories keep flooding back in and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never get better.

Original post from /u/vanman33:

> Hey guys, I just want to make a post right now because I feel like I have noticed a major uptick in the posts discussing suicide in a very concerning way. If you are suicidal, or even entertaining the thought of suicide you need to get help. NOW.
I'll paraphrase a response I gave in another thread: opiate addiction already has a ridiculously high mortality rate, when you add in depression and suicidal ideation you would have a better chance of survival getting ebola while cave diving. I don't want to diminish the value of this message board, and I don't want to discourage people from posting here if they are struggling with this stuff, but I can't stress enough that considering suicide goes FAR beyond the purview of this forum.
So, if you are considering suicide PLEASE get help. Tell a loved one. Tell a doctor. Call a hotline. Go to an Urgent Care or ER. Call 911. Ask someone to hold onto any firearms for you. Whatever it takes. I tried to kill myself in 2008 and have lost too many friends since then. I fucking hate cliches, but it really is a permanent solution to temporary problems.

> You CAN do this. Please, if you are considering suicide you should know that you can walk into any medical clinic anywhere in the United States and tell them you think you might hurt yourself and you will get treatment. You could walk into a fucking plastic surgery clinic and if you said you were concerned you might hurt yourself they would either render care (unlikely) or get you to someone who would ASAP.

Given the usual protocol for quitting, one thing I really do not want to do, is to trade one opiate addiction for another; i.e to use Suboxone therapy, only to then have to quit that horrible shit down the line. So although I have all of the following at my disposal to get me through this:

Clonidine

Gabapentin

Tramadol

Suboxone

Kratom Extract

Valium

liposomal vitamin C

magnesium 

5-HTP

Melatonin

&#x200B;

I think the most sensible, and most high chance of success, will come in the form of a week long program of something like this, for a week, tapering down where necessary:

Clonidine - 0.3-0.7 every 4-6 hours, Do not exceed 2.4mg/day.

Gabapentin - 300mg, 1-3 a night

liposomal vitamin C - 3000mg, 2-3 times a day

Valium - 10mg, every 6 hours

magnesium - Daily, along with multivitamin

Kratom Extract (home made from powder) - dose as needed

5-HTP - dose as prescribed on bottle

Melatonin - 20mg, night time only

&#x200B;

If there is anything that anyone can recommend, I would really, truly, appreciate it. I have given myself a week away from everything to get over the worst of this. During that week, I will be exercising regularly (I am a 6 days a week gym enthusiast, as well as a 2 hour a day/10,000+ steps dog walker) and will have a great friend who will check in on me daily after she finishes work).

And just for a little background; I started down this nasty path when I was introduced to Oxycodone for pain. After learning how nice it can feel when insufflated, rather than swallowed, I started buying in extra, and then, realising how badly I was fucking myself financially, switched over to Heroin, which I have had even less control over, always seeking that fleeting high, which comes at a higher and higher cost and dosage.

In the weeks leadup to my week of detox, I have been bringing the dose down - avoiding trying to feel a high in exchange for simply fending off WD's - but I still succumb to the desire for a high from time to time, pretty much always when I've had a few drinks and I lose my inhibitions. 

I've read so many stories in this reddit group; my first real foray into reddit, and I have been truly inspired by the support and success stories I have read here. So please, I beg of those kind and experienced members here, to please help a man at his wits end, who is willing to do anything (aside of sign up, by name, for any kind of program - long story - but simply not an option) to regain the freedom I once knew and thrived on so well. So much so, that I would call freedom the most central tenet of my existence; something which has been noted by anyone who knows me well, making it all the more ironic that I have fallen into a trap where I have willingly given it up in exchange for a fleeting high which only gives me the illusion of having freedom from the numerous difficulties inherent of the human existence. What a joke I have played upon myself...

 I stole some shit from my job; the kind of scenrio you can getaway with once or twice but keep going and BOOM! Well got fired and this was a job I was at more than a yr, felt respected, built up a reputation and even more so my faucet for more drugs, so why do anything to turn that faucet off? Well... More drugs. Then car breaks down woe is me but I started getting unemployment quickly and the weekly funds helped me keep the facade of a Potemkin village. Not so much hiding ever growing descent from anyone but more so I had the money to get high and thus could bullshit myself easily. So about this time my mother tells me its time to get help (we all know if when people start to see our dirt it's 10x worse than we tell ourselves) but fuck that more drugs to do so MARCH ON! One day or weekend binge I get so high I don't remember shit, time got really 
 distorted and I lose my wallet ($120 along with it) So I cancel my cards. Long story short unemployment cut me off due to ""fraud"" and rn I have a better chance contacting God and getting a reply than reaching them (Md) few more weeks go by I start I owing people and get desperate, needing a way to fund my habit & how ""convenient""  for me my sick grandmother goes into the hospital and... Ya know where this is leading I found out her info and send myself $500 telling myself I'll find a way to cover this up. How?  Tbh never did (any ideas). She's on her deathbed I come clean and am public enemy #1 as I should if I'm being honest (who does shit like this?) Me and my brother get into a fight, I'm in the process of being kicked out (atleast to rehab preferably) and while I try to inject some humor in here to fool myself once more I feel the consuming pit of shame with every letter I type making this so hard.  On top of this I have an autistic child who obviously won't mind being let down once more.  I'm typing this LOOKING FOR SOME SUPPORT but know I really don't deserve it reiterate who exactly Steals from their dying grandma that would have walked the ends of the earth for them ? I always thought I felt rock bottom but the truth is it gets lower and lower the more I March on.

Quick back ground on habit: on 125mg of methadone which doesn't hold me for shit due to this fucking fentanyl (I know amount can be subjective but for me got up to 2g a day which is a career high from .5mg) so I either can dip in take homes or do some more dope to keep from WD's.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996594190597534}"

I did have a real serious 10month tear of heavy heroin use ending Aug 5 '19 and went thru some godawful depression and anxiety then I starting chugging like 15-20 beers and 3-5 dime sacks of Heroin beginning around the first of December last year and ending on Dec. 31 of last year I got myself into detox. It really tore my head up and drove me back to meetings and now after 50 days I am like completely freaking out more and more as though I literally don't know what to do with myself. I did get diagnosed bipolar and actually have the credentials and may find out anyday that I will get a crazy check in a month or so. A lump sum. BUT!, yes the big BUT---What's going on? Why am I like flipping out? Why can't I control my brain and my mind and the nonstop depressive and ultra anxious thoughts and feelings and just plain my whole consciousness.

I'm even telling myself and outright feeling uncomfortable at meetings and JEEZ! even sitting in my living room and watching some old movie in the evenings I can start into myself and have these fairly deadly serious thoughts and feelings down into my core- ""I'm alone again everynight and it's always gonna be this way"" Everyday I start feeling strange, dark, eerie FEAR and hellacious discomfort.

I would like to use the methadone for the next couple of days to get through the first few days of fent wd, just took my last dose and am not going to get more. I've heard of the Bernese method, and would like to try that once I am able to. Would it be better to just not take the methadone and try to get through a couple days using kratom & then slowly introduce the sub? Or could I take a little bit of the methadone each day and once it's gone take some kratom, then after about 24-36 hours after the methadone runs out start on the Burnese method with subs? I have a child coming and seriously need to get better now, I just have never experienced this where induction of suboxone takes SO long to do. I have heard three days should be long enough to start, but I am concerned if I do take some of the methadone for those three days that it may build up in my system and add another couple days on. It is only 90mg like I had said, so am hoping if I do 30 or less each day that by day three I would only have to wait another 24hrs and can start to safely introduce subs to the mix so I can finally be rid of this stuff.

For me, I had stumbled into pretty intensive opiate abuse when I was in my early teens. It was the biproduct of using it as a prescription painkiller and also feeling depressed. I didn't know how it got so bad and so fast, but it just did. Whenever I was really upset I tried to use it to make the pain go away. And then I just needed more and more. The worse part was I never really got the help I needed because I wasn't exactly the ""stereotypical"" image of someone who was going through those problems. I was, and am, a highschool student who did well, didn't hang out with the ""wrong crowd"", and never skipped a day of class. I am in band and I have hobbies. But no one understood that the days I went to school shivering, I was going through withdrawl. No one understood that some days I showed up high just to let myself live through another day of it all. That's why I think perpetuating the image of drug abuse as  something that only rules certain neighbourhoods or people is so so harmful. This can be ANYONE'S problem.

What's your story and how did you get better? I'm at a point in my recovery where I can't take it anymore. Some days I'm really struggling to stay sober, probably because I used when I was so young.

I got off the suboxone but fell into using morphine in the fall of 2019, I then got on to kratom about a year ago with occasional periods of morphine and other harder opiates. But I‚Äôm so tired of it all,  I want to achieve complete abstinence from all substances. And I am doing so much better than I used to even managed to get a few clean urine tests. But ever since getting to get off all opiates I struggle with constant cravings and anxiety not to mention a lack of appetite. If you were to look at me you wouldn‚Äôt notice I struggle with this issue as I somehow manage to workout everyday and have a very strong body but it‚Äôs like I can only eat after I take an opiate cause it takes away the anxiety. The anxiety makes me unable to eat or do much of anything cause the anxiety and cravings are so overwhelming sometimes. Could my brain not be fully healing cause I am unstable with opiate use meaning the anxiety and cravings are so intense I end up using sometimes? I would have thought my brain  chemistry would be back to normal by now cause it‚Äôs been since September I went through the physical withdrawals but I‚Äôve also have yet to  reach complete sobriety. I would be able to reach sobriety if my brain didn‚Äôt feel so chemically unbalanced everyday.

I do think some people are more prone to addiction then other people for example some people can try dope and never use it again.

However other people will not stop using it once they get their first taste.

I am not saying addiction is a product of your environment although I do think it plays a part.

I have never met someone who uses heroin and is truly happy with their life, in fact from what I have seen they are only happy if the dope is in their veins.

The reason why I think using drugs is a product of your environment is backed up by science and in this video, I will go over why and what makes me believe this to be true because at the end of the day numbers don't lie.

Hopefully this will give people a new perspective and possibly a new hope, I still plan on making a video on EMDR.

I was consuming tramadol for 6 years on a daily basis. Couldn't live without it. There were times I was consuming 600 mg per day to feel normal. I was so active and encouraged and as a workoholc, I was in need of it forworking about 12 hours per day.

Then I stopped consuming it about a month ago. Why? I could't bear it anymore, I hated myself for doing it and there were thoughts of damaging my liver or my health system. I'm 32.

I wrongly thought the concequences of withdrawing from it is just physical. I was wrong, dead wrong. When I withdrew I was on a 150 mg daily dose. I was almost OK for about 3 days and then suddenly I began shaking, there were unwanted thoughts all over my head, brain zapps, mild seizures and crying. I was crying like a baby, I didn't know why and I was horrified. 

I was in hell, I thought I'm going to die, so desperte and dead inside. There panic attacks that drove me crazy. I felt hopeless, and seere depression was around. A friend told me to call a doctor.

The doctor prescribed me Sertraline and Chlordiazpixide. She said it's normal to feel these kind of emotiona and because of low serotonin dosage in your brain, severe depresion hits you. 

Now I'm on week 3 of consuming sertraline and it balances my hormones in the brain. I'm OK but not happy as I was with tramadol. there is no panic attacks and no severe mood swings. 

What I want to ask is will I ever be normal again? I was so horrified at those moments that the feelings of never recovering bothers me all the time. I also don't want to live on these medications for so long, I don't know till when should I consume sertraline.

The fact that doctors were also handing them out like candy at the time didn‚Äôt help, if you went into see the doctor for an issue as simple as a sore muscle, tooth ache, just very ordinary ailments that did not require opiates made me wonder why doctors were so generous in prescribing these medications that lead your mind and soul to the gates of hell. Many times while in withdrawal I would beg for a spiritual enlightenment, it was like my being was screaming for my soul back. I felt like I was in a spiritual battle without a proper defence, I had no spirit and was therefore doomed to fail. At the moments of withdrawal I always wondered if I was the only one having these spiritual cravings, but if you think about it going through withdrawals you are absolutely reminded of how vile and horrible this experience called life can be and are therefore more likely to forsake any notion of there being a higher power of any kind whatsoever. Not only that but there was times when I was trying to get clean and I had a friend come see me who was going through withdrawals I just got this insanely bad vibe from him or something to the point where being around my bro made me nauseous and genuinely scared.

Today I considered finding methadone. Feeling as if nothing can be fixed, and that nothing can be solved. 

I feel stuck in my emotions, and I don‚Äôt know how to escape. If the point is to be happy in unhappiness, then I feel I‚Äôll never find it.

I sit in bed all day looking at YouTube videos, or reading Wikipedia, just trying to pass the time. I find distractions all week long while I wait to see my girlfriend over the weekend. Nothing else matters. Everything is grey and morose until the week passes unto the weekend. 

Everyone complains that I need to do more things for myself. But no matter how much I try, it all seems impossible. I wish I could find a modicum of motivation. I wish I had what it takes to find something for myself. 

I‚Äôm so stuck and hurting so bad that I didn‚Äôt know it was possible. I tried antidepressants, but no SSRI has ever done anything for me. I try so hard to treat my bouts of panic and melancholic state. I wish I had an answer, but nothing gets me through the day. 

I‚Äôve given myself to doctors, therapists and other self-respected persons with no luck. Happiness seems to only visit twice a week through brief moments of mania.

My life has boiled down into two options now: all other treatments seem rubbish. It seems I can either wake up with amphetamines and calm down with benzodiazepines. Or else I can get through it all with opiates. All other treatments make me feel like a slow, painful death. 

All I can do is sit through the pain and work towards the illusion of happiness. Today I will try to better myself by not vaping nicotine for the first time in a year. Today I will continue my Gabapentin taper down to 900mg. Today I will continue my first week of sobriety off Prozac.

Total time on these has been from the beginning of august 2020 to now which is mid February 2021. Starting my taper today by taking 2 whole pills (4 halves). I‚Äôm documenting this because there doesn‚Äôt seem to be many subs on this specific topic. Most likely because it‚Äôs hard to give a good idea of the strength of this trash. 

I‚Äôll try to update daily. My wife recently did the taper and it worked well for her so thankfully I have that mechanism of support with full understanding of the problem I‚Äôm looking to tackle.
I will be working 10 hour days 5 to 6 days a week during this excursion. 

The plan will be to do the 2 pills for a week or two (or until I stop shitting my guts out). Then I‚Äôll cut it down to 4 quarters 4 times a day spaced out by 4 hours. Finally I intend to knock it down to 2 quarters a day one in the morning and one before bed.

My intention of this sub is to help people that are attempting to get their life back have somewhat of a roadmap of what to expect. Before I got stuck on this junk I was big into weight lifting and shredding guitar. Since I got on these I haven‚Äôt touched my gym and I can play stuff I already know but learning new material is near impossible. It‚Äôs like my fingers are stupid and I can‚Äôt hold attention. I just want my life back for myself and my family...

I'm kicking ass in life and have almost everything i could really want.  I never burnt bridges in my addiction and somehow still put myaself through college.  So now I'm able to enjoy my life free of addiction, however im hitting the same wall that always sent me out before.  

When I was growing up, my best friend and I were both super driven toward a very specific career and life path.  We trained together and he couldn't pursue it at the time because he needed perfect vision.  I delayed a bit after that happened and ended up catching a DUI which disqualified me.  At that point I lost the only passion, purpose and direction I have ever really had in life.  I doubt I'll ever get that back.  He, on the other hand, corrected his vision and successfully pursued that path.  I'm happy for him.  A few days ago he reached out and it was cool to hear how he was doing even if he cannot disclose much.  I have to say, I'm ashamed that I feel MASSIVE ENVY towards him.  I want to just be happy for him but I feel hatred towards myself for ruining my own life.  I don't believe we really have choice in life, so I don't think things could have gone any other way, but I still cannot seem to let go of the resentment towards myself.  My sponsor has been MIA for like two weeks now and I haven't been able to get to a meeting and I'm getting to a point where I'm isolating and I cannot make these thoughts stop.  I just needed to express this because its driving me crazy and I don't want to be an envious or jealous person, especially towards friends that I really value.

My recent plan to kick fent didn't go so well as my WD symptoms were very delayed and my anxiety spiked high.  So I went back to drawing board for a plan to speed up WD with minimal discomfort  and I have done all calculations and read enough to give the Bernese method a try and looking for ANY feedback on the following 2 options

Is there anyone who has tried this method with feedback to give.  All responses are welcomed but really hoping I can find people WHO HAVE DONE THIS METHOD.

**ALSO..out of the hours of research I have done I learned something pretty cool to share**.  Fent gets stored in adipose tissue (body fat) but yet **IT IS NOT DOSE SPECIFIC**.  What that means is that I could snort 100 pills a day and my buddy could snort 2 a day...and it's possible his WD are worse than mine because of dietary, hereditary, genetic, and physical activity variances.  So while I am not at all upset with people's response to my last post...but the people who told me IT WAS GOING TO BET REALLY BAD ON DAY 5...that advice isn't actually scientifically accurate.  It is possible because I am a bodybuilder who regularly takes (doctor injected) testosterone and have low body fat (currently 9.3%), it's possible my WD's may not be that bad.  That being said, I did have terrible WD's a few months back but I since have switched dealers so to everyone else's point...who the hell knows what I've really been taken which could also be playing a gigantic role.  Anyway...I will post my live updates when I start on Wednesday..but

Which plan would you guys use? (for those who have tried and maybe succeeded...or those who have tried and maybe learned from their experience?)

**OPTION 1 (**[from sidebar of r/opiates sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/suboxonefaqs)**)**

EDIT#1 Everyone is quick to say you will go into PWD.  So why is it proven in medical journals that I have posted?  Are these journals lying about their results?  Also, why are other people writing this method WORKS and detailing their every day with the good and the bad...but ultimately saying this method works?  example ([https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/i2conf/day\_5\_rapid\_suboxone\_detox\_from\_pressed\_fent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/i2conf/day_5_rapid_suboxone_detox_from_pressed_fent/)). 

I just don't understand if people have read a bunch of these posts where people tend to recycle this notion that it doesn't work and thus disregard the positive stuff???

My partner is a recovering drug addict and has recently relapsed and had been using (primarily smoking) .8-1.2 grams/day of fentanyl for about a week. He's getting sober today. He's planning to home detox 18-24 hours so fentanyl gets out of his system to then take his prescribed suboxone (avoiding precipitated withdrawal). 

I am concerned that not going to medical detox is unsafe because I cannot provide medical support and don't know what his symptoms will be like and which ones are normal and which are dangerous to ignore. Of course I'm also afraid he could die. Every detox websites have claimed detox cold turkey is unsafe and it's only safe to detox under medical supervision. (But aren't they paid to say that to get sponsored by detox facilities?) 

He's gone to detox 7 times in the past 10 years in and out of recovery. He was successfully clean for 5  years until covid and other personal difficulties caused him to relapse. In the past the detox facilities would not do anything for the first 24hrs to avoid dangers of precipitated wd. They just check his vitals every hour. 

If the concern is he could be tempted to use if he detoxes at home, know that there is nothing stopping him from using after getting out of detox. He's choosing to stop using drugs, I am not his mother forcing him into detox and rehab, this is his choice and his responsibility to get clean.

The Question: is there any safety difference to detoxing at home for one day (before safely using suboxone) or at detox facility where they will just be hovering over him checking his vitals every hour for 24hrs before offering him suboxone for WD symptoms",6,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980402588844299}"

If it helps others, here's the GUIDE of MEDS I used:","BACKGROUND OF MY STORY:

I am absolutely impressed and I have no words to say about this. I've been using daily heroin for a long time now (around 8 months since my last relapse), and the last months due to my increasing tolerance I began to shoot up around half a gram to almost a gram per day, but due to some circumstances related to my family and loved one I really had to quit this time, because if not I'd be sent to rehab again and since I live in a state where there isn't meds available for heroin addicts like me (such as oxycodone, methadone, etc.).  My thoughts were like ""Fuck no, I don't want to lose my job and be forced against my will to be thrown inside a 4x4 room, completely locked up, and on top having to be sharing it with other 4-6 dudes within such space, without adding the fact of having nothing to ease the wd's symptoms"". Honestly, the most they would give you (if you're luck) is an Alprazolam pill (Xanax) to calm you down for a bit, but then you only would get Ibuprofen with Paracetamol at much, which it's trash since it does nothing to help to get through this type of withdrawals. 

My mom and dad told me they would not force me this time, but instead said they were going to have me tested for drugs in the next two weeks at a clinic near by which is very accurate and almost impossible to cheat on them (they put personal behind your back when you pee). We made an agreement that if I did a positive result in the doping test, then I'd be sent to rehab right after that. I'm only 22yo and still living at my mom's house so, yes, she is the one who rules in here. My dad, from the other side, he doesn't live here (has other family now) but still pays for our home services, insurance, food, etc. 

I know how horrible opiate withdrawals are and can be if used to frequently. These last days before quitting at all I began experiencing very uncomfortable feelings (due to the lowering of dosages). I was really scared to stop because of wd's so looked up on Internet and Reddit to know which meds would be the best ones to use for this situation, then I bought them and as of now they have seemed to work perfectly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUIDE:

-  4-6mg of Alprazolam (Xanax). This one may varyed from tolerance but since I didn't have any I dosaged 2-3mg per day. 
- 275-300mg of Pregabalin. 
- 350-400mg of Tramadol. This one gotta be careful with dosage since it can overdosed on it and seizures aren't fun (already experienced it).
- Kratom (red vein). I gave it around 3-4 different tries during each day with a dosage of 5-7 grams per cup. I used Red Bali by the way.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9923129677772522}"

We met 11years ago and he abused pain pills during that time like most teens and young adults in our neighborhood. We had our son in 2011 and he started using heroin in 2012 or 2013. He turned into a different person when using heroin. Disappeared for days, stealing, lying, disrespectful, irritable, irrational, in and out of jail...just a complete asshole. And like an idiot... i stayed, thinking eventually it would get better. He's had times when he tries to go cold turkey but he always gives in because of how uncomfortable it is. The only time he's ever been sober is when he's in jail. When he gets released, he's only sober for a couple weeks. About 2years ago, he overdosed and detoxed in the hospital. That time he really seemed motivated and ready for change but he gave in to the urges again. Then we tried kratom. For some reason it would make him nauseous. So he gave up in that. Finally he decided to go to the methadone clinic and that was horrible. It didn't seem to be helping him. It seemed like a legal way to get a buzz in my opinion. I wish it worked for him but it didn't. Then he got into some legal trouble and ended up on an ankle monitor. He got high and cut the monitor for whatever reason. I still don't know why but I'd had enough. I broke up with him. About 2 weeks ago he contacted me apologizing for everything and promised he's going to get better. He said he was going to rehab in another state. He gave me a date of when he'd be leaving. And he asked me not to give up on him. The day comes for him to leave for rehab and he loses his wallet(something he does regularly) so he no longer has an ID. He needs an ID to go through processing at the facility. So he calls and asks me to set him an appointment at the DMV so he can get a replacement ID. Because of the pandemic the next available appointment to get an ID isn't until the end of April. I set the appointment and hid the fact that even though it's out of his control...it bothers me to have to wait. I have to hope that he actually goes to rehab when the time comes in April and that makes me nervous. I can't trust that he's going to do what he promises because he lies so much. There always seems to be one obstacle after another or one excuse after another and I'm just ready to leave this in the past and start healing. I've wasted a lot of years waiting for him to get better and holding his hand and I'm tired of feeling like I'm his mother. One minute I want to help and the next minute I want to give up. I just want to finally live a boring lifestyle with no chaos or confusion. I do love him very much and when he's sober..it reminds me of who he really is and why I love him. But when he's using, I don't want to even be near him. I don't want our son to grow up and realize his dad is using drugs. I want him to grow up and hear stories about how his dad changed his life around. I know its not my addiction but i have a fear that if i give up, he'll give up and never get clean.

It's a lot easier now than it's been in the past but they'll always be that small part of me that wonders...maybe this is the time I can get away with it for awhile and put it down. 

But I know myself better now, and I know its like a pack of smokes for me and that I'll use n use until they're gone and the desire will linger on. 

Opiates are so fucking insiduous, they're like an invisible virus of thought that slowly tickles the back of the mind massaging the reptilian impulse desire centers of the brain. The part that says sex is absolutely vital and yearns for pleasure and companionship.

Opiates temporarily shuts up that lizard and whispers sweet nothings into his ear into the night. Constantly reminding of the good times that were had while glossing over the slavery and chains that came with using.

The constant clock watching every moment. Every second. Wondering how much longer the buzz will last, when I'll be using again. When I should order more as to not run out, if I really /need/ to order more or if I just get that /perfect/ high with my current supply then I can finally call it quits.

If the current pleasure is worth the impending restless legs, warm and cold flashes, the chills with dread and emptiness and a feeling of utter hollowness...and when that is over the boredom.

Oh god the boredom, I think Im bored now, I can't even begin to comprehend the suffering that freshly awaits me with aknew if I reopen pandoras box and reach into the forbidden cookie jar.

I just don't know anymore, I wish they didn't have such a hold over me like fuck I don't even think the high is anything special its honestly boring as fuck why do I romanticize something which brings me so much god damn pain?

Fucking duality is why, I assume that if something can bring me so much terror and anguish, then the opposite must me true as well? The hair of the dog that bit me, I mean in order to love something you gotta really hate it at times to don't you? Like a rainbow in the dark, or a snake eating its own tail or some shit.

I know if I relapse on opiates it may give me energy in the beginning, and it'll likely be a fairly positive 2-3 weeks... until it slowly turns my life into a living hell.

The fire will be slowly burning down my house, and creep up towards my bed while my family dies of smoke inhalation in their rooms above me. With my eyes closed in bliss I smell a waft of smoke and ponder ""am I laying in a sleeping bag near a beach fire? Mmmm how nice maybe someone brought marshmellows, graham crackers and some hersheys and I'll have a smore"".

After awhile the high always transitions to me becoming lazy/antisocial and wanting to stay inside away from people. The high becomes my soul focus, the reason to go to bed at night, and the reason to wake up...after all hey the first high of the day is always the best innit? That is even if can manage sleep, as opiates always have an annoying quark of both paradoxically keeping me tired but just slightly awake enough to not enter full restortive REM sleep.

I don't know why I even wrote all this, their really isnt a point to all this rambling. I guess I'm trying go convince myself to stay clean, and if anyone else is reading this then I hope they do to. Maybe I'm throwing the proverbially penny into the well hoping for a splash from an addict who can relate.

I just wanted to tell my story and maybe it can help someone.
My boyfriend got a surgery on his foot that left him fucked for months. After the surgery he was prescribed oxys and pain killers. We both starting abusing them for quite some time. Fast forward two years I find myself in a dark hole. COVID doesn‚Äôt help either. During quarantine we used so much that after we wanted to stop we couldn‚Äôt. We went into MAT and it work amazing for me. 
I knew I didn‚Äôt wanted to be in methadone for too long. I hated the whole process of dosing and the treatment center. It had a specific smell I couldn‚Äôt stand. I took my first dose of 30mgs but my body was still withdrawing.  I went up to 35mgs. 35 was too high for me ( my eyes were rolling backwards) and I didn‚Äôt wanted to go higher. 
That day I started tapering and going down 5mgs per week until I got to 15mgs. When you lower the dose your body needs to stabilize for you to feel somewhat ok. It will take 2-3 days for my body to adjust. I still had a job that I needed to go to and that helped with taking my mind off my wds. When I got to 15mgs I started tapering 2mgs per week. This is when everything got harder. My cravings came back. You have to fight them back and get busy doing something. Finally I‚Äôm on my 3 week with no methadone or any opiate. Weed helps a lot for me. Edibles do incredible things to make you feel better. 
After my treatment my heart got a little fucked. I ended up with high blood pressure and head pressure while I was taking methadone and even though I‚Äôve been off of it for 3 weeks my heart is getting better day by day. This whole MAT experience was something that changed my life. I realized I was hooked with opiates and I didn‚Äôt want to be in the same situation with methadone, but needed to be off. I tried my best and finally I‚Äôm 3 weeks off. I‚Äôm telling you after you are done every day you feel better and better. Weed and edibles helps a ton.

Now let me tell you what my boyfriend is going through. He used for longer than I did so his wds were stronger than the ones I had. He ended up going all the way up to 80. For some reason he didn‚Äôt keep up with my pace of lowering as soon as we could.
Now I‚Äôve been trying to convince him of going lower. Hopefully he listens to me. We all need to try out best to get off any opiate on our system. Opiates are the devil.

I understand that everyone is different and their process may differ, but we all want the same. BE OFF OPIATES (the devil)

Now finally after three weeks I start to feel like my old self. Opiates made be forget the essence of What I was. I realized all the bad traits opiates bring (low sex drive, no need of socializing, you become very antisocial and very paranoid. In essence you just want be home getting high) it‚Äôs hard to remember your old self but with time you will remember things that makes you happy and you realize how even the smallest thing can do the difference. 

This past two years are all a blurred. I don‚Äôt remember even a quarter of those two years. After finally stopping methadone your brain starts to re-wire and you start remembering what your old self was. 

WE ALL CAN DO THIS!!!
ITS NOT AN EASY ROAD BUT IF YOU GUVE YOUR BEST YOU WILL SUCCEED.

If someone need someone to talk to Im here you can message me and we can talk and get through this together. 

All I really want to do is help people, but you have to be willing to get help and try your best. If not it‚Äôs hard to succeed!

Alll the best wishes for everyone who is struggling. But have faith and be strong! Your mind is capable of anything!!!!

Many many people would benefit for getting a very limited prescription of benzos when requested to assist off an addiction will in fact help far more people.  

Some people are willing to go to detox just so they can get the Benzo.  How stupid not to just let them go home on the overhead?

Give more addicts very low sedatives would see a huge drop in dependency.  Whenever I've had zanax I could always make it through a wd and that lasts a while at least so more time clean while most other times I do not make it to the other side. 

Not everyone addicted to opiates is going to go off the deep end on Benzos. Most don't even mess with Benzos.  Most of us are just as aware and nervous as you.  Are you that worried to give 6x.25?  That could mean the difference between someone getting well or staying in the chase.  We just need that tiny sleep that couple hours chill time anything just a scrap to break away from that horror.  I just don't think you understand it.  

Also please don't think gabapentin is better! Forewarn people it will lose efficiency especially on WDs if you take it everyday.  It is a powerful weapon but loses so much weight after being prescribed even at low doses for so long.  That takes it out if our arsenal.  After awhile it does in fact start to become in impossibility to sleep.  I'm still weaning. 100mg drop= 4hours sleep lost with only 2 hours regained at 2 weeks.  This stuff isn't what you think if you're worried about dependancy at first there is ZERO wd a miracle but eventually becomes to where when I stopped cold turkey from only gabapentin was sober I didn't sleep for over a week not one hour in over a week.  

I tell you these things you've been trained otherwise and I don't think you are hearing any of us.

(If you're wondering how the hell I was able to afford this - I live in Europe, oxy is dirt cheap here compared to the US/CAN/AUS). 

For me, addiction didn't really creep up on me. Seven years ago I made a conscious decision to start taking oxy daily, knowing full well that I would become physically and psychologically dependent on it. I just wanted to be numb all the time and I thought that I was better off on oxy. And for 7 years I really believed that I needed oxy. That I couldn't live without it.

That is until recently, when something suddenly snapped inside of me. I finally realized how much opiates changed me and how shitty my life has become. I realized that I wasn't blocking just the negative emotions that I was running away from, but also all the positive emotions and joys that life has to offer. I realized that I've become a dull, emotionless, lazy recluse with no girlfriend and no social life at 27. Throwing away my youth by getting high alone in my messy apartment.

I finally realized that this is not the life that I want to live. I have so much potential that I've been wasting. So many dreams and aspirations that I want to achieve.

So for the first time in my life, I decided to get clean. I'm on day 13 of suboxone taper and I'm now 100% comfortable on 0.7-0.8mg of bupe / day (started at 12mg). I'm continuing to taper down and I'm hoping to jump off the bupe in a few days once I'm down to less than 0.25mg/day.

Even though I'm still not 100% clean (in my mind) because of the small amount of bupe I'm still taking, I already feel a massive difference in my mindstate. It's like I'm waking up from a long sleep. My emotions are coming back, I cried several times during the past 13 days after not being able to cry for years on oxy. And it felt amazing to let it out. 

Music sounds so good and it's been helping me a lot to stay positive. My libido is coming back and I'm starting to notice girls again after being esentially asexual for the past few years. I feel like I'm finally ""present"" again. I don't feel so disconnected from the world and everyone around me anymore. 

But most of all, I feel so good about myself. I had a few moments during the past 13 days where I was thinking of giving up and relapsing, but I always managed to talk myself out of it. And I noticed that every time I manage to do that and overcome the cravings, I end up feeling really happy and proud of myself because I know that I've made the right decision.

I know that I still have a long road ahead of me and that the hard part isn't over yet. I'm also aware of the ""pink cloud"" stage of WD and I realize that some of these strong feelings will subside over time and that this new reality will become more dull. But I honestly feel happier than I've felt in years. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I just wanted to share this with you guys, since nobody in my life has even the slightest clue about my addiction (and I want it to stay that way). I also noticed that it helps to write down my thoughts and feelings.

I went to a 30 day residential treatment the following February - my second time doing an inpatient program. When I got out in March 2020, I relapsed the next day. Since then, I've not stayed off heroin longer than a month. I started suboxone in September and was on 3mg for a few months, but kept relapsing every so often, and after using daily for the month of January, have now started 8mg of suboxone daily. Yet, a week later, here I am, using again.

I just don't know what to do. When I'm clean and on suboxone, I just feel like I have nothing to live for. I'm 30 years old, have some college credits from a decade ago but no major. I was always and I'd say still am passionate about music, and enjoyed writing and performing music for a long time. But for the past 5 years I struggle to keep that a part of my life. I feel that I have no real talent and no longer really truly enjoy the process of creating, which makes me feel really sad. Because other than that, I've never really had another passion. 

I guess I'm just wondering how to find a purpose and a reason to keep living. When I try to come up with it myself, I think of the obvious; friends, family, my cat, etc. Basically a gratitude list. But it doesnt feel like enough. I wish I could maintain the junkie lifestyle, but I can't, and it makes me want to not live anymore, which makes me feel guilty in itself lol.

I have gone to some dark, dark places through my substance use, as I'm sure you have too.

I started the dance pitifully young and I am still young, turn 27 next month. 

Opiates came back into my life (after a nearly 4 year hiatus) about 1.5 years ago. Crazy how different of an experience it has been compared to before.. Anyways, if you are interested in learning more context on me for whatever reason (lets be friends?) feel free to check out post history, I've given more details. 

The change I am referring to in the title - I have been trying to go from shooting black to starting a short sub taper. Inducted and went back to dope 3 times in the past 3 weeks. 

I am now 48 hours since any black and have taken some bupe (just for the first 3 days, maintenance FUCKED me up). 

Something that changed in the last week. My perception of heroin went from seeing it as my friend, a loved one.. you know.. to something foreign and harmful. It doesn't feel like my friend at this moment.

I've had this experience before! Afterwards things became much, much easier. It feels like i have been so disconnected and I am finally mindful and feel like I can take the observers perspective and see that I AM NOT MY THOUGHTS. 

I'm excited to be me again. I'm excited to experience life. To love and grow. I hope to be more active in recovery communites. I have had a great experience in AA (and some pretty bad ones). I hope to give Recovery Dharma a proper go, it seems to really line up with me right now. 

Can you relate to that 'change'? It feels LIBERATING.

Over the past year, I‚Äôve been addicted to kratom. I take the red strain averaging about two ounces a day at the height of it. Probably averaging around an ounce 1/2 a day.

For most of it, I lived in a large city where I've created 'triggers' for using over time (bars, bathrooms, certain areas of the city, etc.).

Thankfully during the pandemic my wife & I were able to relocate to a rural area, where I had little access to anything, except for kratom. I used kratom for a month or so, and eventually quit. I'm now around 10 days into being clean, and I feel pretty good. Lethargic at times, but things are looking up.

However, we are moving back to the city in 3-4 weeks, and I'm starting to get a little worried about some of the triggers I'm going to encounter there. As it stands now, I know if the right trigger hits me at the right time, I may use. I can avoid some of these triggers, but avoiding all of these triggers isn't really an option, as some of my triggers are things that are necessary in every day life.

I'm looking into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but it is a bit of a challenge with the pandemic right now. I've also taken up some old hobbies to occupy my time, and I'm getting back into the swing of things with work (I have a tech job, so I can work remotely).

I know withdrawal from Prami or Requip can *itself* cause RLS - among other symptoms. My question is: has anyone used one of these meds for RLS during withdrawals? How long did you use it for, and did you find that you had any rebound symptoms when you stopped the medication?

I'm not trying to sound like a whiner but I am pretty lonely. Does anyone want to try to get sober with me? Or maybe check in with me to make sure im on the path? I feel like if I had someone holding me responsible it might make it a little easier. I have kratom and I get gabapentin, so the withdrawal should be relatively painless, I genuinely dont know what my problem is.

Went from 80mg to 160mg over the weeks, until I had no money and had to borrow from distant friends or colleagues just to get my fix of this stupid anti-diarrheal.

I'm also on paroxetine 20mg/d, which is reportedly as strong a Pg-p inhibitor as quinidine, which allows more loperamide to cross the BBB. Now, before anyone says it's placebo, I don't think placebos constrict your pupils, nor do they depress your respiration.

Anyway, I took my dose on January 24th, caved in on January 29th and now I'm day 5 clean off it. Day 3 was perhaps the worst one for me - I was having severe bouts of anxiety, restlessness, chills, flushes of hot and cold, RLS, basically everything you get from classical opiate withdrawal. I had no idea this underwhelming drug would produce such gruelling withdrawals.

I phoned my GP, basically begging her to script me some clonidine - in my country it's a completely unheard method of mitigating drug withdrawals, she was hesitant, but I told her I knew the dosage for this particular use of clonidine. Since then I've felt a lil' bit better, taking 0.3mg throughout the day in three separate doses.

Even though, I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, I can't carry all the burden that this detox has thrown upon me. I'm almost 29 years old, still living with my parents, had a horrific argument with my mother yesterday, which ended in her telling me she doesn't want to know me.

Also, I really want to meet my girlfriend whom I love so much I'd do anything to her, but whenever I leave the house I'm accussed of attempting to get more drugs or booze. My beloved girlfriend tells me I'm neglecting her, but I just don't want to pay the price of being thrown out of the family home. I'm so torn apart. Detoxing while having to cope with family and girlfriend is just too much. Last night I was contemplating suicide. I don't have a stable job and I'm highly indebted.

I have no means of moving out, besides my parents are absolutely sure my gf provides me environment where I can do drugs, but they are WRONG. Sorry for the long ass post, I feel like I'm trapped.

I was married to the love of my life. I went to prison when I was twenty, got out at 25. While inside I met a woman through writeaprisoner.com. We fell deeply in love through letters as crazy as it may seem. It was so nice to just have someone to listen. Someone who saw past all my bullshit to that inner child who is vulnerable and sweet. When I got out we were married within 4 months. She was my everything, the love of my life. She left me after 4 years. While she was gone I tried heroin for the 1st time. Actually my first shot was heroin and cocaine. Me and my wife patched things up after a month. She started using heroin with me when she found out. We were the same person, do as much as I can as fast as I can. Push the envelope. After a year of on and off using and trying recovery we decided it was best if I moved back home to get clean and she went to her moms. We couldn‚Äôt get clean together the moment I saw her sick I went and picked up. I just couldn‚Äôt bear seeing her that way. I moved home and cleaned up for about three months. She decided to go to rehab and right before she left she broke off our marriage. She said she was used to being alone. I of course relapsed. I found a dealer here and I‚Äôve gotten progressively worse since. There hasn‚Äôt been a day I‚Äôve been sober in almost a year and a half. I‚Äôm using iv fent about 1 gram a day and meth. I‚Äôve lost everything. My job, my wife, my car, my home, my dignity, emotion. I don‚Äôt know how to beat this.

He's 23 and been doing drugs for the past 5 years. It was casual use and i did it sometimes with him (weed and rarely coke) but he stepped up the game. He did so much coke so he needed heroin just to go to sleep, and once he tried heroin he was hooked.

I would say he is functioning user. Means he has job, but thats all he does. Job and drugs. He works at home and lives at home with my parents. He doesnt give a fuck about family members, has no passions, no hobbies. After job, he just goes to his dark room and spends the whole fucking day there either sleeping or watching some bs. We had family talk at the start of december about usage and he said he will never do it again (he was crying and all) and he went into withdrawal and was clean for 1 month and then he fucked it up again.

He's never agressive, always says he swears its the last time. If my mom busts him with drugs, he gives her everything without complaining. I think he really wants to quit, but he just cant. Since he started doing it again me and my mother are keeping this from our father, because he said if he ever gets him high after new year he will be living on the street. He is lying all the time.

By one of my favorite poets, Iain S. Thomas:

*‚ÄúThe world would be easier if the homeless were all just lazy and all they needed to do was just get a fucking job.*

*The world would be easier if evil were a real thing, instead of just confusion, misunderstanding, miscommunication and misplaced desire.*

*The world would be easier if you could just be happy for what you had, while you had it. If you could eat memories like flowers to keep your heart alive.*

*The world would be easier if comfort didn't rest on the backs of the broken, if your swimming pool was dug by soft hands that never worked a day in their life.*

*The world would be easier if we all just got rich and famous and we were all each other's #1 fan.*

*The world would be easier if it were an automatic.*

*The world would be easier.*

*But it isn't.*

*The world is hard because it requires real human effort to make it turn.*

*The world is hard because you may wake up today but not tomorrow. And yet no one will accept ""fear of death and a futile existence"" as a reasonable excuse to miss work.*

*The world is hard because you will have to fight for the things you love or worse, fight the things you love.*

*The world is hard because the things you love will kill you.*

*The world is hard because it was made that way by thousands upon thousands of hard men and no one wants to admit we have no idea why we're doing the things we're doing anymore.*

*The world is hard because it's hard to forgive and even harder to forget.*

*The world is hard and you should just give up, right now. Just lay down and die. Nothing will ever be easier.*

2021-02-02 08:28:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/lavfs2/update_a_few_weeks_in_now/,"Update, a few weeks in now","Hi guys. So I've gone from a minimum of 180mg dehidrocodeine per day (1260mg mg per week at minimum) to 300mg per week. 

I have actually increased my dose than what I was on before but my mentality to the drug has started to change. Whereas before I saw it as something I need to get me through the day I now see it almost like a treat. 

I get 10 pills a week and I go through them over two days, but whereas the days without pills would have been difficult before, I'm now not dreading them like I was when I was using regularly. 

Before the pills where the default and when I didn't have them it was a bad day. Now days feel normal again and when I have pills it's a good day. Sort of like it's flipped into reverse. 

It's taken a little while for me to feel any difference in myself. But recently I notice that I am in a better mood throughout the day, even when I don't have pills. And I'm not as prone to mood swings and depression as I was. I still have bad days but not as bad and I'm slowly getting better at dealing with them. 

I think because i know I can get pills by the end of the week, I'm not trying to find something to replace them with on the off days. The other day I had a bottle of whiskey in the morning and I was tempted to have some to make the day better. But I was repulsed by the idea of needing alcohol to get through the day. Then I realised that's what I've been doing with the pills and it made me feel differently about them. 

The changes are slow and I don't intend to kick the pills completely for a while yet. But I think at the current rate I am ok to hold here for a while and let my mind get used to the idea that drugs aren't a crutch anymore and that days without pills are the default so not having them is no excuse for being sad or frustrated. 

I may not be going about this in the best way. Instead of tapering like I wanted to I have instead just reduced my dosage. But given that the mental dependency is my issue I think that's a harder thing for me to break them the chemical addiction. I am very unhappy with life right now and it's not going to change anytime soon so removing the coping mechanism too quickly is a recipe for disaster. 

But all in all its going well I think. 

Good luck to you all. This is harder than I expected but I feel better for getting some control over it at least for now. 

I still want the drugs. I don't want to quit. But I do want the benefits that quitting will offer me. So I need to keep hold of that. 

Stay strong group.

However, is this just my area or is there a long wait-list elsewhere? For those of you also waitlisted, don't give up!","My significant other wanted out. She's been homeless for 20 months because of her addiction.

She would go with a counselor, her sponsor, or myself to the detox and rehab center she was eligible for with medicaid. Sometimes she even took the bus by herself. It took dozens of times waiting at their for hours because each intake day (not even every day) were limited to zero to three people at most. The coronavirus has caused serious disruptions in the process. She applied for the waitlist to other recovery centers that would accept medicaid, too.

There were 4 attempts over a 14 day period where she was turned away after 30 minutes because she tested positive for rapid test coronavirus, so that's fair enough. At least here, if you test positive they cannot treat you unless you are admitted to a hospital.

About twenty days the 1-3 spaces available were taken due to police psych holds, OD's, or people who were arrested and offered ""go to jail or rehab""; which get priority. In the summer there were more ODs. In the winter, sometimes people freeze their butts off and will say the magic words to get a psych hold for 72 hours.

About 12 days they simply didn't take anyone that day due to already being at capacity.

Three ER visits but it wasn't for OD so she wasn't given priority and without an open spot, it was discharge back to the street.

SIX times she was denied because she needed health clearance for her medical issues. This was a real pain to get medical clearance and records not related to coronavirus. Finally showing up with a physician signed letter and medical records on a day without too many ODs or psych holds worked.

Don't give up. Between the virus and winter, public resources are stretched thin. It is very frustrating to see others get help before you when you really want it. Stay strong. Your time will come.

As to my question, I am curious if this experience is in other regions as well? It used to not be THIS difficult.

But I've been diagnosed with cptsd and have had depression since I was very young, and I can feel I'm never truly happy, struggle a lot with energy and motivation in life without tramadol. This drug has saved me, given me the most wonderful days where no problem or trauma could touch me. 
My job performance has been so much better.
But its not real. Not me. Who the fuck am I without this chemically induced state.

I've been struggling emotionally since I was a child. I understand why I've done to cope 
From bulimia, to cutting for 4 years. 3 hospitilazitions in a psych ward from 13-15 years old. 

When I turned 15, the same day as I got out of the hospital after five weeks I tried cannabis for the first time and that replaced the other coping mechanisms. Did that for 5 years before I startet to have panic attacks when I smoked, then I found pills
I'm 24 now and I was last committed right before Christmas because I didn't want to live anymore. But I do, but not like this. It was only for 4 days but I did tramadol in there. 


But for the first time in 14 years I won't have anything to manage my emotions with when things get hard.
It's a painful lesson yet to be learned for me that I havent ever really learned to comfort myself, grow healthily and give me the chances in life I really deserve but have not been provided by others or given myself.

I‚Äôve tried my hardest to win her over but she‚Äôd rather believe I‚Äôm the same cruel addict I used to be so it‚Äôs fine, even after a great day with them, I finally give up and admit defeat. For me it‚Äôs what turned me to using especially when I relapsed. But even over the years I‚Äôd try to forget about her and that wasn‚Äôt healthy I needed to admit defeat and move on. I‚Äôm hoping this leads to long term sobriety for me since that was my biggest emotional toll. I know a lot of you will say I should have stopped being a bitch sooner but I truly felt like she was the one especially before I started using more and became a monster to her. I feel like she‚Äôs been sending mixed signals which have kept me hoping since I got clean, but I‚Äôm fucking done. If someone wants you, there‚Äôs no strings attached, and I told her if she wants it she needs to bring me flowers.

That being said I loved dope more than anything else in the world even her, and I realized if I can let that relationship go. Letting go of a human can be much easier, especially considering it doesn‚Äôt include physical and the post acute withdrawals.

Whatever you guys are going thru, it will pass but using it as an excuse to use is not okay. I wanted to pick up on the way home today and realized that worldy attachments are way easier to let go and stop stressing about than I‚Äôve been telling myself. No matter the stress you go through it‚Äôs wayyyy easier than getting off opiates. I‚Äôd rather not stress out than stress myself to the point of using again. 

Many blessings all, just how I‚Äôm feeling tonight!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9897834658622742}"
