Al-anon is fine but it's often just sharing with other family members. I want to talk to people who can shed light on my brother's side of the story, so I can better understand him.

My cousin OD'd last week, which has me thinking about my little brother - I've basically given up on him for the most part. He's in a different country and from what I can tell, homeless and potentially sleeping with people for money.  My parents are sweet people but are self-obsessed, no rules, and had/have no idea how to handle him.  They're lovely but aren't strong parental figures, haven't acknowledge that they also share blame in him turning out this way, and have finally cut him off after financially enabling for years.  I'm 2 years older but I think I'm the one that's been there for him the most as sort of a 'firmer/stricter/parental' presence...

**How do I talk to an addict?** All I want to do is lecture him and make him snap out of it. I know that doesn't help him. I've been reaching out regularly via text, etc I love you, you okay, call whenever you want to talk, etc... the rare times he actually calls I try be unconditionally loving, but I often reach the limit of my patience and turn condescending/lecturing which I guess doesn't help... He also rarely calls me sober, it's as if he can't handle a sober conversation with me. Unlike the rest of my family, I always call him out on his bullshit and I can pretty much always tell when he's been using. And when he does call, it's usually to ask for money.

And frankly, he's a real asshole.  I'm torn between not liking him as a person, and having very little in common as people, but loving him as my brother and being really worried and concerned for him.

It's been a long hard road with this kid, so much insanity and heartbreak.

As long as my cousin was alive, I figured my brother would be ok. 'If cuz is alive, then bro should make it through'. But my cousin didn't make it through.  

**So I feel like I'm waiting for this call... for him to call me up one day and tell me he's fine, he's got his life together. And we can have a relationship.  So do I just let go of him and fingers crossed that one day I get that call, or will I get a call saying he's dead?**

**Question for you guys is, what should I do? What helped you? Did family reaching out help, or make it worse? How can I be nice and loving to someone who's such an asshole?  Do I keep trying to get involved, do I quit trying to reach out? and if I do get him on the phone, what the hell am I supposed to say?  Text him motivational quotes?**

This is my first post here; just stumbled upon this sub. I struggled with oxycodone throughout my 20’s, after graduating college. The past 4 years have been some of the most difficult in my life, involving lots of therapy, rehab, doctor visits, interventions, etc. But I’m happy to say that today I’ve been clean for over 16 months. Wow, crazy to think that within the 8 year period of my addiction I was never sober for more than 48 hours. I’m lucky to be alive, and fortunately I did not lose too much. Hurt me financially (now bankrupt), but I feel stronger mentally than ever. Today I feel great; life has made a turn for the better.

I strongly recommend that anyone trying to quit using opioids, please ask your doctor about buprenorphine. Look for substance abuse group therapy; a local hospital had a decent outpatient program which led me in the right direction. Go to meetings. Just show up. Be present. Don’t participate if you’re not comfortable. I guarantee someone will say something that will help put things into perspective, and you will want to share once you start seeing some progress.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8871242}"

Anyway, I have a lot of reasons to quit so now I’m going to do it. I’ve heard withdrawals can be hell but I am hoping for the best. 

Anyone have any experience with that I should expect withdrawals-wise from stopping 60-70mg a day of oxy? I’ve been taking oxy for 2 years, but the dosage I’m trying to cold turkey from started in March.

In October of last year at 37 years old i had a mental breakdown, just about everything and anything that could go wrong happened, from family deaths, ill health, financial problems, it all happened at once, and my addict brain decided in it's infinite wisdom that using would be the answer, all be it short lived, i couldn't believe that 14 years of sobriety, no alcohol or heroin, could be undone just like that, so i went and planned how to score, how much and how i was going to use it, and i went ahead and used. By January i was a mess, habit was in full swing, i looked terrible, I'd lost alot of weight, was in bad shape and was spending money i didn't have, i knew that i had to get help and support, I couldn't believe i was in this situation again, after all this time, hell even my doctor was shocked about the whole thing.

I just got done watching the Intervention episode that aired tonight and I feel more depressed than ever.  I envy these people who are given these amazing opportunities to go to these amazing rehab centers that are usually the best in the country.  I have been trying to get help for over a year now to no avail.  A lot of background:  I was fired from my job of over 16yrs in May of last year and believe it or not it wasn't even drug related.  Only a few people know that I'm a heroin addict (snorting only, never shot up).  My entire family has no idea, which makes everything even worse.  Sometimes I wish everyone knew... Anyway, very shortly after I was fired I started to get physically sick from the dope(/stress? idk).  I have been puking almost several times daily (at times) for a year and to say that my existence has been miserable isn't even scratching the surface.  I have never wanted/wished/contemplated death so much in my entire life.  I just feel like there is absolutely no help for me.  I have called so many places and no one will help me because I'm not rich or because I don't have health insurance.  How can i possibly afford almost 5 grand for a 7 day detox?  I can't even get into a methadone program.  I also can't get insurance through the government because I live with my parents and I'm expected to give them the household income I guess because they're expected to pay for me?  We're not right now but my partner and I pay to live here but it doesn't matter to the government.  I have completely ruined my life.  My future is ruined.  I've been with my partner for over 15yrs and we're both addicts.  He was actually fired right before I was (also not drug related believe it or not) and after that we both cashed out our 401k.  WE ARE SO STUPID!!!  I am so sick when I think about all the money we spent in a matter of months and it's not the first time we've done something so stupid.  Our addiction started in '08 when we were in a pretty serious car accident and we were put on percocet and muscle relaxers.  I slowly started losing my mind after we started abusing them, using more than we were prescribed and buying more off the street.  I've been suffering with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideations since I was 11yrs old (when the bullying started in school) and I guess the drug use exacerbated my symptoms and I just lost myself and wound up going to rehab in 2010 for 38 days while my partner continued working and was put on suboxone from our pain management dr.  I didn't even stay clean a whole month after I got out because I was ""so bored"" even though I went to meetings daily.  I lied about being clean then too.  My life is one big fat lie.  We were awarded a good amount of money each from the car accident and we pissed that away as well.  I am also now in a credit card debt situation I was in when I was younger and I just can't believe I did this to myself AGAIN.  I am so ashamed of myself!  My mother's heart will break once she finds all of this out and I know it will break her and my partners heart if I kill myself but I just mentally and physically cannot do this anymore.  Someone told me to go to an er and tell them my situation and that they \*have\* to help me, I have not done this yet because #1) of Covid and #2) I don't believe they will help me detox in the hospital, I have NEVER heard of anyone doing this.  Why would they help me when there are rehab facilities?  It doesn't make sense to me but if there's someone out there that has done this please let me know.  This is my last reach out for help, I am not asking for medical advice -I read that this sub's description is ""We are a group of people dedicated to helping each other kick the habit.""  I don't want to kill myself but I can't take much more of this- between the constant nausea/vomiting and my depression/anxiety/suicidal ideations, I am just about out of hope for myself and my partner.  I don't want to leave him or hurt him by killing myself and I worry for him if I do do that but I cannot live like this anymore.  Today after I hung up with the last place I called: American Addiction centers or National Rehabs Directory (it says both on their website) and they told me I needed 19k for a month of rehab or almost 5k for a 7 day detox and I told him I couldn't come up with anywhere near that amount of money, they referred me to a state funded help number (I didn't call yet but will tomorrow although I don't have much hope), after that I grabbed all of the pill bottles I could find while crying my eyes out I seriously considered swallowing everything- but I didn't.  Anyone who is still with me and read my entire post- thank you, I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this.  I am begging-pleading for help, direct me, what do I do?

My god, everything that has happened has been crazy to this point. Seriously. I can’t believe I’m still alive.  I can’t believe everything that has happened to me while maintaining sobriety. This is insane.     
    
My story is something I benefit from sharing. So I’m going to post it here. You’ve probably seen it before if you’re active in this sub.   
   
My ex girlfriend left me in February of 2019. She had caught me using a few times before, and we were under the mutual agreement that any more heroin in the house and she would be out. Of course as an addict, rules didn’t apply to me. I got away with hiding some use from her a few times, but it always comes out. She busted me right when I took out a ton of money to make the down payment on a house. Since she was gone now, there was no house. No house, lots of money, and a whole lotta heartbreak could only mean one thing to me - burn it all to the ground.   
    
That’s pretty much exactly what I did. I rode the wave of money until it went out in May. I had spiraled so far out of control. I was using heroin, cocaine, Xanax, and alcohol almost daily.    
   
Clearly my work knew. You can’t hide that for long. One night I stayed up all night and ended up going to work on no sleep. I fell asleep in a meeting and got called out on it. Pending the results of a drug test, I was suspended without pay. I knew then and there I needed rehab so I started looking right away. Had an appointment to go to detox that afternoon. On my way to detox, I got pulled over for DUI. Turns out no sleep will do that to you. So instead of detox, I go to jail. Not good.   
   
I sit for 30 hours and they let me out with stipulations. I now need rehab, an attorney, and a whole lotta money. Meanwhile I’m still using (even though it could result in a warrant) so I can get myself together enough to go check in. I have a ton of stuff to sell, and I can’t risk not having money to live off of and pay my attorney.   
   
I finally stopped using June 22nd with a check in date of June 26th. They want me through withdrawals by then. Alright, here we go. I sat through an absolute living hell for 3 days before I pushed my check in date forward another day to get through it the rest of the way.   
  
I finally check in on the 28th. I get a call from my boss that says I can return to work upon completing a program and I told her I was already getting checked in. That was that.    
   
My insurance allowed me 30 days of inpatient so that’s what I did.  I got out and they recommended follow up with outpatient. I’m craving that at this point.   
   
I go back to work the following Monday. Everything goes really well for about 2 weeks. I went home one night and my stomach was absolutely killing me. I had no idea why. I didn’t sleep well and was miserable but decided to go to work anyway since I wanted to show dedication and commitment. My boss notices I’m not acting right and accuses me of relapsing. She suspends me without pay pending another drug test, I flipped out on her and said I was in pain and probably needed a hospital but it didn’t matter. She didn’t believe me. I went to the hospital and sure enough, it was gall stones. My gall bladder needed to come out, and fast. I sent her all the documentation as a fuck you.    
   
Didn’t matter. I was going to be back paid for it anyway since I knew I was clean. I had my gall bladder out (definitely tried without narcotics but it was pretty painful.) I got 2 weeks off, paid, and didn’t have to use PTO or FMLA since it was all for drug use anyway. Come back to work and now it’s the beginning of September.  
   
I end up getting my drivers license revoked for the DUI once the chem test came back. If I want it back I have to take a test, pay $700, and put an interlock in my car. Fine by me.     
   
I keep plugging on through rehab, I get basically a slap on the wrist for the DUI since I was trying to get help, and it also helps I’m a white dude with no criminal history thanks also to being a white dude.   
   
I complete the rehab program, maybe a clerical error or maybe someone somewhere was looking out for me, but the interlock requirement expired after 2 months. By November I am free and clear aside from a little community service, and a MADD class.   
     
I get a random text from a really good friend of mine from high school. Had a total crush on her a long time. She needs a favor. She comes over to my place and we have a chat to get caught up. She asked some questions and I told her everything. She didn’t run away at least.  Anyways, I add her on snapchat, help her out with the favor she needs, and she’s on her way.    
    
We start snapping back and forth and this turns to that and by thanksgiving we have a date scheduled. Things go significantly better than expected, and we are officially dating by Christmas.     
    
Things have kept getting better every day, just like that, for me all along. I’ll never use heroin again.",20,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7924886}"

To all those who have kicked opiates successfully or are kicking opiates by using Kratom

I’ve been on methadone/suboxone for over 10 years and it’s been 28 days today that I quit this habit along with a 13 year daily benzo habit. I’m currently dosing 5 g Kratom 3x a day along with 2g early in the morning when I always wake up. 

I’m not sure if I’m still feeling withdrawals or if I have really bad unresolved chronic pain/nerve pain. Week 2 and 4 off methadone was terrible. I wake up every morning around 4-5 am, miserable and in severe pain along all my nerves, and especially my legs. It takes me about 4-6 hours every morning to feel normal (around my second dose of Kratom) 

I don’t think it’s the methadone from 28 days of kicking. Could it be the Kratom?

Do daily Kratom users feel terrible every morning?? Is it normal to wake up exhausted after 4 hours and only get sleep once you take another 2g for a couple of hours? This sounds like a hell of a habit to keep!

I’ve  never experienced chronic pain before, but I was also on a dose of daily opiates for 13 years so it was probably numbing everything I needed to take care . I’ve tried quitting Kratom but every morning I start to feel hellish. Is this my pain, the methadone or the Kratom?

I’m so exhausted from not getting even ONE nights worth of decent sleep in the last 3 weeks without waking up feeling horrible(although not NEARLY as bad as when kicking methadone)

I’ve heard that people addicted to opiates tend to get worse withdrawals from Kratom than those who don’t, so I’m really confused as to whether I’m just experiencing severe withdrawals every morning from Kratom, or do I actually have a chronic pain issue. 

Can Kratom users who kicked other opiates weigh in on this?

My problem is that the withdrawals/ pain every morning is so bad, I just want to dose my suboxone and be done with feeling so miserable every morning and so extremely exhausted all day from 3-4 hours of sleep every day. 


Suboxone has not been so dangerous to me as Methadone(DOC) has in the past. However, the fear of going through lengthy excruciating withdrawals down the road makes me want to keep going this Kratom route. However, I feel like the Kratom doesn’t work as well as it did a couple weeks ago but I’m either still kicking methadone or feeling the Kratom withdrawals every morning( which is about 1/3 the suck of methadone but still bad)

I really need some opinions here. Should I continue using Kratom and will the mornings just get better?  Am I having PAWS from the methadone or withdrawals from the Kratom. Or are these just symptoms of chronic pain that are surfacing more than withdrawals are. 

I really hate being on anything but the pain has gotten me to a point that I’ve become a pain on my family(for at least the first few hours of the day) and this has become a painful reality. 

Will this even go away if I quit Kratom or are these symptoms not of daily Kratom withdrawals and could This possibly be something else

1) If you times your last dose for the morning, u might be able to make it to sleep, but u kno as soon as that 12 hour mark hits, your eyes are wide open with pain just being shot all over your body. You kno that day has finally come, and you’re about to be in hell for the next couple of days. The worst part is you have to live through every second, since you won’t be able to sleep. Xanax just isn’t enough. I took 2 grams of kratom, lied down, and as the minutes kept going, I felt lighter and lighter, way too comfortable to be in withdrawal...but wait, those same receptors are being hit and it’s soothing me to bed, boom I’m out cold for at least 4-6 hours while the kratom is in my system. Time to repeat. 

2) Stomache cramps, diarrhea, or vomiting is completely gone. You are able to shit but you are still somewhat constipated.

3) absolutely no hot and cold sweats. 

4) Slight running of the nose in between doses.

5) I’m in a good mood, my energy is at about 80 percent, unless you take a real good amount, in which you can actually feel euphoria and the warm feeling around you. Irritability is nowhere to be found. 

Kratom is an amazing, amazing plant. Here I am on day 5, almost complete, and I have not once wanted to rip my skin off. I dose now every twelve hours, but I can notice the withdrawal doesn’t come in at full force. My body is almost 6 days without fent, it is practically all out of my body, and my body barely feels it’s Absence.

well I thought his behavior was still sketchy a few days ago. when I went downstairs I noticed a lump under the carpet. when I looked to see there were two wrappers. when I asked him about it he claims they are old. I don’t know if I believe this.. the wrappers from when he used February-April have a different stamp then the ones I came across just recently. also the wrappers I found underneath the rug have the same stamp as the ones his brothers gave him. 

yesterday his behavior still struck me as odd. his pupils look small to me (I don’t know if the light takes part) but he also sounds really drowsy and lethargic. what other signs can I look for that will tell me if he’s still using or not?

Today I asked for help.,"Long story short, I was medically discharged from the military almost ten years ago due to a back injury. April of 2019 I went to Orthopedic Surgeon and scheduled surgery on my spine. April 2019 I was given my first prescription on Norco 7.5. I had surgery in June on my spine. Began physical therapy, a couple months go by and my recovery isn’t progressing, it’s getting worse. Fast forward to January 2020, MRI shows massive herniated disc right below the one that was previously fixed. Doc says let try PT and bump you up to Norco 10s. Time goes by, the pain gets worse, and after being rushed to ER in agonizing pain, I told my doctor enough is enough. We schedule SECOND spinal surgery. That surgery was done a little over a month ago in June. I was told that due to my tolerance of Norco, after the surgery, stop Norco and they are prescribing something stronger for Post-Op pain. That ended being Percocet 10s. I’ve been taking them as directed and my pain is starting to very slowly get better. The problem is, I’ve been on some form of opioids for over a year. I’ve become dependent on them. When I try to taper and put more time between doses, the withdrawal symptoms begin. I know myself better than anyone and I can’t handle it. 
However, now I WANT to be done. I want off of the pain medication. I need to be off the pain medication. I feel like I’m letting my spouse and my children down. I know I need help. I just don’t know what to expect beyond the agonizing withdrawals.
I called my mental health doctor today and told her I need help. I need to get off this stuff. The appointment is scheduled for Monday and the nurse told me it will most likely end up being prescribed Suboxone.

Started off with sniffing but have IV’d for 6 months. I was clean for about 8 days in February with little to no WD’s. After that, I used pretty consistently up until now. A week ago, I went through about 2 and 1/2 days clean, but unfortunately I gave in. I’ve been using again for 4 days, but at a much lower rate than I was before the break.

I just got my hands on 6 subs today, 8mg each. In order to take advantage of the little progress I made (my tolerance went down by about half, but I am 100% sure that i’ll be back in the same place after another week), I’m going to try again. Is it worth doing a short term detox using the suboxone, tapering my dose down throughout a few days?  If so, does anyone have a short term taper schedule with the doses I’d take? 

Or on the other hand, would it be damaging to use the subs? Would it just prolong the WD’s without helping with the severity? The last thing I want to do is get dependent on subs and have to spend a month in WD’s. That’s why I thought a short taper would be beneficial. Let me know whether or not that’s the case.

 Lately, post fentanyl era, I've noticed that people have been going into precips after waiting longer, and longer to take their first dose. Even though fent is classified as a short acting opioid. While this is true, it has another trait that will cause it to act as if it is a longer acting opioid within the body of a habitual user.....it's highly lipophilic.

 We care about this for 2 reasons:

 1) because the more lipophilic a chemical is, the more rapid the onset of effects, as well as quicker it's effects fade. This is because lipophilic compounds pass the blood brain barrier easier than traditional opiates, which are hydrophilic, and

  2) because of this fentanyl, seemingly, is metabolized at the same rate as other rapid onset opiates like dope, or Dilaudid. NOPE! Because it's lipophilic, it's duration of effects it's short.....while coincidencely it's overall elimination half life is a lengthy 3.1-7.9 hours (morphine's, which has a much longer duration of effects, elimination half life is a brief 1.7-2.2 hours!). This is true because the opiate ""high"" typically follows the same curve as the amount of an opiate/opioid detected from the.... blood plasma. Fentanyl is cleared through blood plasma within 8-21 minutes. However, it is not fully metabolized, or eliminated out of blood plasma, but instead it gets redistributed into....yup our fat cells. 
  
  Ironically, fentanyl addiction, as well as it's withdrawal are a double edged sword of, rapid onset, and quick duration of ""high"", in concert with an intense, and lengthy withdrawal period.

  What does this mean for us trying to get off this shit comfortablely? Well....unless you're getting actual heroin (you aren't) let's forget the dated information that's still being regurgitated as misinformed advise to anyone unfortunate enough to reach out. Back when it was real dope, no matter how heinous your habit after 24hrs of final use, you were good. Even waiting to score high enough on the COWS scale is not a guarantee that you're ready to take a sub. There's just too many variables when a drug has the tendency to be stored or released from fat cells. Everything from, the amount and size of our fat cells, our current metabolic state, our diet, liver health, presence of ketones, blood sugar levels, etc.

  In summation, I'd love to hear back from anyone who has recently started Suboxone from a substantial fentanyl habit. I've read that microdosing Suboxone; starting very small and slowly increasing dosage, whilest simultaneously taking our DoC for the first couple of days after initial Suboxone dose. I believe it's referred to as the Bernese method.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57371914}"

Im alrdy feeling movement so im kinda nervous i could alrdy be in 2nd trimester and had been taking norco for the last 4 years.

They poured my urine into a 2nd cup which also showed positive for Oxy. I have been on daily Naltrexone for months now and haven't taken any oxy in over 2 years.

My brother (20) has been doing drugs for years now. I believe since around 14 (kind of common in my country. Won't disclose but it's in Europe.)

As far as I understand it, he'll do just about anything, but mainly Cocaine, Xanax-type pills, and Weed. He's been diagnosed with ADHD, and I suspect (will never say this confidently as I'm not trained to diagnose) he might have Antisocial Personality Disorder.

My parents tried everything: love, tough love, therapy, etc. and nothing has ever worked. I'll also mention that my parents smoke weed frequently and are okay with that, although they were careful around us growing up.

He has always been a very manipulative person, and is very good at making people do what he wants. This was very noticeable, for example, in therapy. He's admitted to me that he only ever went to psychiatrists because he could manipulate them into prescribing him drugs, and that he refused to see anyone who couldn't prescribe anything because what he wants are the pills, not the help.

He's also stolen from our parents numerous times. Our family is in no way comfortable, and he knows this. We always had food growing up and we never lacked anything, but we were never in a position to buy much that wasn't needed, so anything that's taken is a big blow. The last time around he stole over €1000, which is huge for the family, and we only found out in time to get most back because he posted videos on Instagram with the money and I alerted dad on time (I don't live with them. In a different country altogether).

After this last time, they had to kick my brother out, as he steals anything he can in the house (mainly alcohol that's locked and hidden and money, but I wouldn't be surprised if he'd stolen other things to sell). We also know that he's stollen from a random house (maybe more) at some point, sells drugs, and goes around trying to instigate fights with people. This isn't the first time he's been kicked out, and it doesn't seem to work either. He's been out of the house for a couple of months now and still hasn't found a job, nor does he want to, and has been jumping from place to place as whenever he finds a room, the landlords want him out shortly after (he's messy and eats their food and will call them at 3 in the morning because he loses his keys). He's also been surviving on food his friends give him, although my parents obviously help with that, as they love him and don't want him to go hungry.

He knows we want to help however we can, and our parents have tried countless times, but since he's an adult we can't force him to be seen or into rehab and we just don't know what to do.

Add: We're not sure how physically addicted he is, as he can go sober for months with absolutely no issues, but cannot kick the mental side of things. I think that maybe the fact that he can't physically feel symptoms of addiction helps him think everything is good.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62135315}"

We tried all sorts of early intervention programs, took him to PhD therapists, had him tested twice for autism (both came back negative). I had to convince one of his PhD therapists that he has ADHD, and likely ODD. He disagreed and said he has adjustment disorder. Not once did they request to see how he acts at home in his natural environment. This was paid with private insurance, not medicaid. I’m at the end of my rope.

I write this as the older sister of a H user, I’m looking for advice on how to advise and support my brother  has been on it for the last 3 years.

He has recently split with his gf who was also a user. So he now finds himself alone with his ‘ball and chain’ (as he describes it) habit.

At this moment he has no money for it and has been forced to go into withdrawal for the last 2 days - and is suffering some pretty nasty side effects. He is currently staying with our mum, I spoke to them both today and he says he just needs enough heroin to get him through until his appointment with the clinic. 

Could someone help or advise how best to deal with a situation like this with a family member? Obviously we want the best for him, don’t want to see him suffer, but also don’t want to hand him money for H.

My mum has been speaking to a helpline for family, but it seems to be all about getting him to go to the hospital for emergency medication (which he doesn’t want to do).

He also said he sometimes mixes it up with crack too 


He says he wants to kick it, but on his terms. It’s hard to get inside his head as I just don’t understand it - it would be great to hear from those who have experienced similar and been through it.

He’s my little brother and it breaks my heart to see him at rock bottom, so depressed and down.

How can we help him? 

Thanks in advance :)",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59708273}"

I’ve spent endless hours on this subreddit researching withdrawals, what helps what doesn’t, asking for advice, just looking for someone who’s been in my shoes, in my boyfriends shoes etc. The people on this subreddit are just incredible human beings. I will admit meeting my boyfriend changed my view on addiction completely. I never judged, but I also never saw someone in active addiction. I never saw the intelligence, the kindness, the compassion, the humor, but also the incredible sadness first hand. It honestly breaks my heart to read some of these stories of people who have had time clean and come on here to talk about their relapse. Don’t let it get you down, it’s hard as fuck but it’s possible and I believe in all of you. 

I don’t want to jinx anything because every time i get excited about my boyfriends recovery it seems like he relapsed but he seems different this time. This is a whole new person. Ive never seen him this happy, this motivated to change his life, this excited to be alive. He’s doing things he never thought he could be able to do without opiates, and it’s not even significant thing. It’s going to the grocery store, cleaning, doing dishes, getting out of bed, going outside, just being a functioning human. I am so incredibly proud of him, I am so happy for him, he absolutely deserves this - as do all of you. 

Thank you for giving me the advice and the hope. Thank you for showing me the kindness and the humanity that most people don’t think someone who’s addicted to drugs is capable of. Thank you for talking with me and telling me that i’m doing great as a girlfriend when I felt like I was failing him. Thank you for letting me know it has nothing to do with me and that this is his battle. You guys were my naranon. Most of all thank you to my boyfriend.

2020-07-19 12:18:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hu33jz/a_lost_cause/,"""A LOST CAUSE......""?","Hey, what's up guys, DON'T EVER believe that you're ""a lost cause"", or there's; ""no help for you"", I been hearing that since I was a young kid in grade school, just off my behavior alone! I grew up on the mean streets of Chicago in the 80's, till 2006. I got heavily involved with one of Chicago's most powerful gang, & along with the gang life, between that, & my brother I was introduced to hard drugs, especially heroin & cocaine, my 2 former drugs of choice. Because of my crazy lifestyle, & drug use, I ended up serving 17 yrs. in prison, 12 yrs. in Illinois & 5 yrs. in Nevada, this is where I was diagnosed with severe PTSD, & Anti-social Personality Disorder.

 I went to prison in 2010 here in Nevada, & during this time, I guess I REALLY HIT ROCK BOTTOM, & remember sitting in the hole, & having an epiphany about 3 mos. in, & just really started picking apart me, my childhood, my life, to see where I went wrong, but it seemed that I was just destined to go through this, that was my final conclusion, but that doesn't mean I can't change the direction of destiny, & start to edit this book, from the middle, to the end of the book, & THAT'S EXACTLY what I did! From that moment on I dedicated to changing when I got out! I got released on Feb 2nd 2015, & paroled to a halfway house, because I knew I still needed some structure, I couldn't go from crawling, to running, without fear of falling, so I took baby steps. I got married, had my first child with my wife at 39, & NEVER took a look back at my former life, biggest thing, NO MATTER how bad it hurt, I had to drop ALL my old ""friends"", & keep it that way. My wife slipped beck into addiction, to which I kicked her out from 2016-2019, & then unfortunately 3 weeks ago, for THE LAST & FINAL TIME!!!

 I celebrated 10 yrs. of sobriety on Jan. 10th. 2020, I NEVER thought I'd get there, nor did anyone else, people STILL don't trust me to borrow me money, etc....,but that's their own shit to deal with, I know who I am now, & I'M NOT that lost cause, waste of life, piece of shit that EVERYONE used to call me, now I get called names like; ""good father, hard worker, & loyal friend""!!! This week I started working IN A REHAB, as a Tech Aide, if someone would've told my former ""stick up man"" self this 10 yrs ago, I would've laughed & robbed my future self!! Lol! 

There's about 4-5 people I know from either prison or the game that's a patient at the rehab I work at, & they didn't recognize me, not more off of looks, but that I was working at a rehab, so it's good to show them that if I changed, ALL YOU GUYS CAN TOO, I'm  ""A LOST CAUSE NO MORE!!!!""💯 I used methadone to quit, but WHATEVER works for you, methadone & suboxone are life savers, my brother also just celebrated 10 yrs clean too, & WE BOTH did it with methadone maintenance, it's definitely better than poking yourself, & getting arrested, like I said earlier, you can't go from crawling, to running, so take BABY STEPS to get clean, sobriety isn't something you can rush anyways. I'd suggest getting mental help in conjunctionwith drug therapy, because if you JUST TREAT the addiction, that's like putting a regular band-aid on a gaping wound, you have to find out in your childhood what went wrong, or if it happened just from hereditary, but from my experience, EVERY DRUG ADDICT IS MORE THAN ""A LIL CRAZY""!!! Lol! I wish ALL you guys luck, battling this devious beast called addiction, make ALL your doubters EAT THEIR WORDS, & SHOW THEM YOU'RE NOT A LOST CAUSE OR A WASTE OF SPACE!!!!💯",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5725997}"

Anyway im really happy because earlier this morning my ex who I first ever did dope with and rode freight trains with hit me up on Instagram after we had lost contact for nearly 4 years! We broke up on perfectly good terms, we had known each other since I was 13 and he was 18 so we were friends before and after we dated, but the main reason we broke up was that I wanted to stop using and he didn't so we ended up losing touch for a while. But we just talked for like 2 hours and he's doing awesome, he's not homeless anymore he got a private room in a shelter with no curfew, he got his GED and is going to school, and has been on methadone w no relapses for the last year or so.  

Made me really happy because this is someone who despite not talking for a few years knows me really well- had the same group of friends in the punk scene back like 12ish years ago, also grew up in nyc, etc etc- and it's just a really nice feeling to hear someone is doing good and be able to reconnect so instantly like that. It's kinda like we're both on the ... other side, I guess, of things now. All that craziness that defined both our lives back then is behind us and despite the long hard road to get there we're both living semi normal lives. I remember when I was a youngun seeing older ppl in the punk scene who were at where im at now and wondering what it must be like. Time goes by in a surrealistically quick way sometimes man.  

How is everyone else doing today? I gotta leave for work in like 2 hours but today is my Friday and I only work a 6 hr swing shift thank fuck. My fucking couch I ordered came yesterday a day early and I panicked because I was at work and couldn't lift it alone but luckily A and her boyfriend were able to swing by and help me take it in and put the old nasty punk house couches on the curb and like 3 of my neighbors were like ""oh Emily did you get your package alright??""

emotionally, codeine seems to work for me. i have energy, happiness, and enjoy life when i'm on them. i've been worried about the damage of excessive ibuprofen use (ibuprofen/codeine combo) and wanted to give up the opiate crutch.

i stopped cold turkey, just over 2 weeks ago. i'm still feeling pretty shitty to be honest. depression, extreme lack of energy, aching/restless legs, and brain fog. came so close to relapse yesterday, to the point of driving to the pharmacy i get the pills from but turned around at the last moment. previously i'd just transfer to another addiction like alcohol or benzos. i can't smoke weed (gives me serious panic attacks).

I’ve been on 6mg of suboxone for almost 2 years now. Ive come to realize that I’ll never feel that now is the time to taper because of my fear or feeling sick so I think the time to start is now. 

I’m perhaps not as strong as some people because in the 2 times I forgot my dose, by about 5pm the next day I start to feel noticeably bad. 

Questions:

1: my doctors first step is to go from 6mg to 4mg. Will I feel any noticeably negative withdrawal-like (physical or mental) from doing this? He assured me I won’t at all but I’m wondering if I will a little bit even and how long that would last if so. 

2: I haven’t obviously ever had a mental effect from this med, it was purely for withdrawal avoidance and maintenance after the fact but I have this feeling that maybe it is helping my mood or something and I worry that when I get to 0mg that maybe I’m more depressed than I think. This is wrong to think right? There isn’t any mental benefit?

Heavy dilaudid habit for a month. Only stopped when I ran out, January 2020 was the only time I went through physical withdrawals.

I've relapsed a handful of times since. A small dose of tramadol originally prescribed to my dog. Oxycontin stolen from my mother's safe. But what I used and when I used it doesn't matter.

This morning I woke up feeling like shit. I get irritable with my anxiety and depression sometimes, and today was one of those days. My mom woke me up to give me a list of chores, and I responded annoyed because it's my only day off this week and wanted to sleep in. And I could tell she was annoyed that I was complaining.  I went to mow the lawn and the mower battery died halfway through. It was disgustingly humid outside and I was soaked with sweat. I just felt fed up with everything that I had to deal with today, and in life in general.

So of course, my brain went straight to oxy. My mom wasn't home. I got into her safe with a nail file. I ate a 5mg pill. I don't think I even really wanted to, but I did, and then I waited. In about 30 minutes I calmed down from seething to okay. But I didn't feel happy. And I wasn't proud.

My partner texted me and I told them what happened. And they asked if I had considered doing anything else to cool my anger and anxiety besides oxy. I was about to type out some excuse about how it's too hot for me to go skating or do something physical or I didn't have time or whatever but I stopped. Because they were right.

I have slipped back into my old impulsive ways of doing things without a second thought. I am better than this. I deserve to be better than this. I am taking accountability for my own actions and I am going to commit to getting clean and staying clean.

When I felt like a person instead of a body. But I have realized I'm not going to find that person in drugs. That person never used opiates. Oxy won't bring him back. Only I can do that.

From now on I refuse to act like a victim and keep continually hurting people I care about. I have therapy on Monday, I'm going to tell my therapist about my drug problem. I haven't mentioned it because my mom has been home during my video sessions, and my last therapist told me I didn't have a problem (among many other weird/unhelpful things).

I have a few pills in my drawer that I took this morning. I snorted half a 5mg about an hour ago just because I hate the feeling of coming down off oxy, and don't want to be all groggy and annoyed while eating dinner with my mom tonight. I am slightly high and I will be honest I hate it. I want to be sober again. I'm getting rid of the pills before I go to sleep tonight. And I'm never touching them again.

Thank you to everyone who has commented on my posts/posted on this sub. Your words played a part in me waking up and realizing something has to change. I am going to change things. I want to be myself again.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78205353}"

After 3 days of detox from fentanyl blue pills...I caved in and relapsed, I know I probably had a day or two before all the physical symptoms were gone...but I couldn’t handle the restless nights and...I relapsed. I digress. I am now thinking of admitting myself into a residential detox program to rid my body of this demon drug, but...is it worth it? They seem to be so expensive; though I’ve probably spent more money on fentanyl; but does anyone have any personal stories of getting clean in a rehab or detox facility? Does it still hurt like Hell for 3-5 days during the detox? Would you recommend it other than doing a personal detox? Any information or stories are welcome. If not recommended, I’m going to relapse for a day or two...then go back into Hell, but this time I will kick this habit. I would just like to know if rehabs and detox centers are the way to go, or if you should just tough it out with high amounts of Vitamin C, and Kratom in solitude. Any advice is appreciated.

People are coming to this forum to recover from opiates not transfer their habit to another opiate. Plus, need to be extremely careful telling others they should use Suboxone because it worked for you. Especially,  if you don’t know their history, usage, life environment etc. Suboxone is a serious opiate drug and to recommend it is playing with fire. 

The irony is literally what Purdue pharma did to advertise OxyContin and it was over prescribed, misinformation, and misused. Then folks got hooked and couldn’t get off...I.e. Suboxone. 

I’ll end this with I don’t care what you claim your sobriety or how you define it, that’s your life. And it is fine if Suboxone helped you get clean and change your life.

Not knocking methadone, been there done that and everyone's sobriety is different but maintenance is key for sure. 

It's nice getting therapy and working on your emotions and actually being able to feel moments of joy, happiness, and hope. The program is pretty chill and you kinda get out what you put it but for me I just needed a controlled place where I could break the cycle.

Fuck i love u babe....
Its fuck up and it incredibly piss me off to be like that, i tried for years to try to get closer to people so idk i would get a friend or a girlfriend that would respect me and maybe like to spend time with me.
But nothing works as i dislike humans kind it dislike me, and honestly i wasnt using with people and try as much as possible to be pleasant( if i would be my own host each time would have be awsome)

people arnt confortable or enjoy spending time with someone like me whatever they say..
To get back on point i grew to hate so much people, even before being homeless i understood that people are mostly full of shit and way disapointing.
So my life was pretty lonely but not as after the 2 and a half years homeless, its just disgusting how much people i knew alot and a little that told me non stop bullshit; U can spend one night on mt couch, u can come hace lunch home or what ever need they think they can help with, but they wont or mostly wont just to give u a true clue lets say 3/100 was honnest, the rest whatever the relationship i had or if they owe me money or not always had multitudes of excuses and i wasnt even hoping but i could say i had hopes i was wrong and told myself just test it if they choke u wasnt exoecting much.
All that shit i went trought just show me that as much i hate to be in love with opiates, it was my only way not to feel so lonely and somehow ""loved"".
Afters years of being in that state and for a while sick of living like this cause now i feel my life is just about opiates, people find me sympathic, intelligent and if great short term compagni, so can still penhandle or have my fix by commision, which dosent help, for a while now my relationship with opiates is like an old annoying wife that would give me awersome sex, as much as she piss me off im so use to have her that a life without her seem alienated to me...,
My life is fuck up and im open about it cause i try for awhile to change it even if it would be just little by little..

To be honest i tried a damn lot to killmyself with multiples failures, before i starr using opiates, once i get my fix it push suicidal thought away for a while, which was great at first but now it would feel great if my problem were only self harm and being disgusted if life and humans...

I just don’t know what is wrong with me. Why do I keep fucking up, just had my longest stretch of sobriety in like 5 years, basically since i truly started using daily. And fuck man did I feel great during it, no stress, saving money, and no fucking withdrawals. Then I was like fuck it I can do a 30 and be good about it and that one 30 was so great I got so fuckin high. Of course that turned into starting to do it every other weekend, then every weekend on and on blah blah blah. Then back to the dope cause I am week and have no self control, or money. Then I Od’d and then a week later I Od’d again and both times I woke up to the cops and my mom balling her eyes out. like that I think may be the worst part of it. My dad died pretty recently and I just gotta continue dragging my mom through the shit. 

Anyway here I am having dug myself a substantial economic and emotional hole. Of course I’ve been doing benzos with my opiates cause why wouldn’t I. Oh yeah i’m a complete piece of shit waste of life moron, whoops almost forgot. Again I just don’t get it I just want to be clean but I continually fuck up over and over again. Now i’m super depressed and my anxiety has been through the roof, I really wish I never woke up. Actually I feel like that all the time. Honestly if I had the balls and my mom and sister were not around to be completely torn apart by it I’m pretty sure I would have ended it already. I just really wanna be clean but I continue to make the wrong decision and just keep getting high. IT’S SO FUCKING STUPID.

Ever since I was a 19 year old professional hockey player and my team doctor prescribed Vicodin so I could play on a bum knee. I was a superstar and my team needed me. Unfortunately, opiates just mask the pain and do nothing to build strength. My knee gave out and I lost the hockey career one rainy Tuesday night in Portland, Oregon, in 1977.

But the addiction remains. I’m 62 years old now and have graduated to heroin for pain relief. I started going to a methadone clinic two weeks ago. It seems to help the withdrawals but 20 pathetic little milligrams of methadone does little for the pain.

I know I’m going to use again. I was thinking of trying a real detox clinic in the Vancouver, Washington area but they are full up until September. But I’m on the list!

Your stories inspire me but some of them scare the shit out of me! Like PWD’s? Wtf?!? I’d rather stay using than go through Suboxine treatment!

I’m trying to do the right thing and NOT use but it gets harder every day. I have drug dealers constantly texting me to offer me great deals during COVID and it is so hard to turn them down. 

This methadone seems to be helping and they’ve offered to up my dose to 40mg on Thursday, so let’s see what happens. I go in to dose at 5:30 every morning. But I need help at night. That’s when my cravings hit. Maybe they’ll let me take half home at night. I got a lockbox for it.

I have been using lortabs on and off for about 10 years. I stopped for a long time but in 2018, I started using almost daily. They are 7.5mg I take 1-4 daily. I have chronic pain but the last couple months I have been trying to stop completely and Jesus Christ are the withdraws insane. 

So I have tapered down to half of a 7.5 daily and I’m trying to go 24 hrs without taking any
So my last dose of 3.75 was last night at 6pm. I was trying not to take any at all but I got so irritated, shaking, I legit felt like I was going crazy. Had a full panic / anxiety attack and meltdown. Ended up taking half a pill. 
Couldn’t sleep all night and ended up taking a melatonin at 3 am. 

Fast forward to today. I was trying not to take any at all. I woke up around 11. Drank coffee and around 3 pm decided I wanted to get out a bit. I made it to the grocery store started having crazy withdrawals. Anxiety. I left the store shaking. Couldn’t finish shopping. I drove home and took 1/3 of a 7.5 mg. So 2.5 mg. 
I live alone. No one knows about my addiction. I don’t have anyone I can talk to. I been researching detox clinics to do a medical detox but want to try to do it alone at home. 
I am now in the bath because water is the only thing that calms me down so if anyone has ANY advice or can offer me stories. Anything
I’m seriously going crazy. Also have bad thoughts when in withdrawals.

Feel like dying on it and dying when I’m without it Day15: starting to slip/struggle!,"Hey I’m desperately looking for help. I’m stepping away from a methadone/suboxone habit for 10 years using Kratom. I was wondering if I should reach out to groups in Minneapolis. I’ve relapsed every time I’ve tried to quit and this is the longest I’ve gone so I’m hoping the worst is over but I am an inch from relapsing every few hours and I feel like dying on drugs and dying without. 

Even though this isn’t a “clean stop”, I’ve made it to 15 days without methadone/ Suboxone but still feel withdrawals. Kratom worked wonders for a week and then stopped working 50% of its basic course effects. 

I get horrific nightmares at night, takes me 3 hours to get out of bed/relapse using my subs in the drawer, intense pain and weakness all day, not to mention unmanageable depression, anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts ( not because I hate my life but because withdrawal and drugs give me no hope or ever being normal as I’ll be hooked on the Kratom after which I have to take 3x a day)

I have ALWAYS relapsed due to very poor social support. I’m a Muslim guy of Indian/African descent in the USA and addiction rates in our community our extremely low. It goes without saying, this causes great stigmatization of the problem as one being of personal will rather than a disease. For years I denied telling myself it’s a disease and I sometimes continue to (because no one around me sees me as sick but morally wrong instead). 

I ask them how they can’t quit a nicotine habit and they think they could quit an opiate habit. These people have no idea that this is not a choice it mine. It’s a trap where I need the drugs but I also cannot take the sickness of being without them while having to work full time, be a husband and a father with no break. 

I wish I could get some support. It would be tremendously helpful folks! 

Day 15 on Kratom 4-5 grams down from 10 years of methadone and suboxone daily abuse (6 years methadone followed by 3 years suboxone with the last being a flip flop between the two with excessive methadone binges in between. 

- I’ve tried all the supplements. I can’t tell that they do much. 

- I try to eat. I’m usually starving but nauseated simultaneously 

- My wife, as beautiful and lovely as she is does not understand the utmost basics of physical addiction. I don’t blame her but it would help to have someone around understanding that I’m not “weak”. (My point about people who can’t quit nicotine calling people like me weak. It’s laughable at worst)

- Every morning is a following of a terrible nights where I sweat like a dog and have nightmares so bad that I cannot bear them emotionally. I haven’t dreamed this vividly in 15 years. It’s extremely disturbing. This is the point during the day I’m most likely to relapse. But if I do, I will undo 15 days of hard work and restart at some point. I also however have to keep my job which has been very hard to do during this! 

- I have guests coming over in a few days. Should I take an extended oxycodone to feel normal for one day. I know this sounds idiotic but in my culture, I can neither skip this nor tell people anything about my condition. 

- I ended up quitting a 14 year daily benzo habit during the methadone binges of the last 6 months. Should I just take benzos for sleep for now so I have a lesser chance for relapsing?

I’ve tried all the supplements and honestly CBD cigarettes have helped me best so far but I need help and would sincerely appreciate learning how I can best continue till it’s just Kratom in my system and then finally start working down my Kratom use. 

PS: eating always helps make me feel good but marijuana gives me terrible anxiety and personality disassociation. CBD cigarettes helped with all these issues. Is there any CBD only bud I could buy to help me with this?

Much blessings folks!

What’s helped me is my 3 year old son and faith in God to not despair. Any tips to help me avert these worst than life nightmares (I understand I’ll need therapy regarding this some time down the line) as well as the terrible feeling during the mornings.

I've been on suboxone, bought off a friend, for about 4 years, on and off. This last dependency started in Sept 2019. I have wanted to get off deep down, for good, and 15 days ago was forced to due to him selling them way too fast. My dose was about 4-8mg a day, but I improperly tapered and took just like 1-2mg for a few days then 1mg the last day and jumped.

It didn't work. So, two days in I had him run to the dealer twice and get me 2-3 bags of the east coast fentdope whatever stuff, and used that for about three days (last Tues-Fri morning). I know it's bad but I have literally no money so couldn't really form a new habit. 

Friday was starting to get sick, and Saturday (4th) was feeling HORRIBLE. At that time I figured it was just the peak of sub withdrawal (day 6 at the time). 

Somehow, Saturday night he got someone to front us like a half gram, and that lasted till Monday (1 week ago, day 8 no sub). For reference I snort and I'm talking tiny tiny bumps. 

Well monday I obviously start to feel like hell, somehow make it to Tuesday where I get paid and buy one more bag. It runs out wednesday but I have enough money to drive the next state over and get some kratom (it's illegal here). It keeps me well but runs out Friday morning, wherein I start to feel sicker and sicker and sicker for the next three days. 

Yesterday, day 14 of the detox from sub, I went to go get more kratom with the last of my money, and am using it here still, so I'm ""safe"" for now. I usually feel much better around day 14, even cold turkeying high doses in the past.

My question is, did those little bits of dope form a new habit, even though I was doing for like two days and then quitting for almost 48 hours? Or did they somehow start the sub withdrawal over? I'd honestly rather it be fentanyl or dope withdrawal or whatever just for the sake of that lasting less time. Does anyone think I'll actually feel somewhat recovered tomorrow?

And I will most definitely run out of kratom tomorrow morning, but it's then payday and I'm thinking I'll just go get more to have till Thursday when friend gets sub script, and instead of having to worry about the crazy fentdope (been five days as of now since that), and then take tiny doses of sub for 3-4 days and be done with it (I've had success with this in the past, kratom doesn't have precipitated withdrawals)

Lastly, I have been taking a fuckton of kratom, but my stint with it after about 3 days of nothing is gonna only be like 36 hrs.

Firstly, I wanted to thank everyone for such nice comments, it meant a lot to me. 

My partner came back home two days ago. That means I'm two days clean. He obviously wasn't happy with the fact that I started using but he isn't going to leave me. In fact, he helped me find a psychiatrist and after I'm done with detox I'm gonna start attending NA meetings. It's not gonna be easy at all and honestly I'm scared. But I am going to do my best and I'm already trying really hard. I managed to shower and I eat as much as I can without vomiting. My partner is staying for two months and it doesn't seem like a long time but I want to enjoy it while it lasts. I'm scared of how things will change when he leaves again. It's not even about having someone to check up on me, it's just that loneliness is seriously messing with me. But I guess that's something future me is going to have to worry about.

The phone interview felt more like shaming me than any plan to recover and focusing on dumb shit to cover their own asses.

1. Basically wanted to report a child in family to social services incase they happened to be around me when i was high or took one of my pills. I dont live with kids and pills are locked away. 

2. Wanted to report me to dvla maybe to suspend lisence i dont even own a car currently.

3. Wanted me to tell everyone which would just ruin my life

4. Wanted me to take home overdose kit.


The plan they gave was to self reduce slowly no help other thab when i kick it to give me a tab to block opiate receptors.

I feel like going to them is pointless. They just basically want me to lose a lisence get me in trouble by having social services calling to my familys kids and make we walk around with an overdose kit when i never overdose and only orally take tablets.

I’m not sure where else to post it. I’ll start with a little bit of back story and then get to the point. 

I started using pills at about 16(25 now)when I got my wisdom teeth out. I don’t remember much about those days just that I was left to my own devices with them(my parents didn’t hold onto them and divvy them out as prescribed) and I abused them as soon as I got them. I would drift to a heavenly sleep and I never fully stopped. My dad has had dental problems for years so he usually had a bottle or two hanging around that I could grab without him noticing. As you can see my parents aren’t the most observant. Though one day my dad did find an empty bottle of his in my trash can and all I got was a strict talking to. 

Couple years passes, I’m not doing them daily or anything but the thought of how much I love pills is still in my mind. I start working at about 17, and meet my best friend Maggie.(not her real name, of course.) we hangout for a bit never mentioning pills until one day she asks if I want to try adderall before work so that the shift goes by faster. I of course said yes and we had fun with those for awhile. We eventually meet someone who can supply us klonopin and though we never used those together, we both began to use them regularly. 

Couple more years have passed at this point and I meet my boyfriend who Maggie actually introduced me to. Me and Maggie drift, but we are both still dabbling in the pills. Maggie meets a boy who is utter garbage for her, and she tells me they have been getting a little heavy on the klonopin use. What I didn’t know was the new boyfriend was a heroin addict. They overdosed at a house party; in a car, in a driveway. Eventually someone found them and Maggie was pulseless. She didn’t even have to be at that damn house party; she texted me and asked if they could spend the night at my house that night but my parents never would have let her boyfriend stay here without having a clue who he was. She could have overdosed in my damn spare bedroom. I don’t know how to cope with that. 

The most painful part of this is Maggie never regained conciousness and lives in a near vegetative state; in a care facility I do not the name/location of. 19 and her life is over. She will never wake up. while the boyfriend got narcan and didn’t even spend the night in the hospital. 

I saw her once, about a week after her overdose and she was not yet breathing on her own. I could never get a response from her mother regarding visits after that visit. Her family doesn’t respond to texts with updates. The dealer who sold them the laced heroin went to jail so I wonder if the police also saw the texts between her and I about the klonopin use. Maybe they think I knew she was doing heroin. But I didn’t. I worry that that’s why I was cut off. I don’t blame them, I can’t imagine the pain they’re in but I have to believe she’s in there somewhere and could just maybe hear my voice if they’d let me near her. I feel so much guilt for being here and healthy. I feel guilt for not staying closer to her and more involved after getting with my boyfriend.I am still fighting to stay sober to this very day and that makes me feel even worse. She lost her opportunity to make a life for herself and I am still willing to waste the life I still have at my weak points. 
I just have so much guilt.

I am probably about a year clean from opiates (dunno exact date) and I've been thinking about those pills again.

Every time I'm clean for a while and ive sunken back into a routine, I start realizing how unmanageable my anxiety is. I've had extreme anxiety since a traumatic experience when I was <10yo. I couldn't believe how magic opiates were for anxiety when I found a family member's script back in 2009ish. 

Until a couple years ago myanxiety manifested in a typical panic attack - crushing chest, rapid breathing, heart racing, sweating, racing thoughts, shaking, etc. I still do get those but now I also get nauseous to the point of dry heaving or my eyes blackout and everything sounds far away or sometimes i actually pass out. I have also developed some weird thing where I keep saying a word or phrase repeatedly like ""hello hello hello"" or ""no I don't, no I don't, no I don't"". It's EXTREMELY embarrassing and I can't control it.

Opiates and lorazepam both relieve these symptoms for me but I cannot take opiates in moderation and my doctor will not prescribe lorazepam for long term use. I've been on effexor, paxil, prozac, wellbutrin, zoloft, and cipralex, which I'm on right now. I don't know why it won't work for anxiety but does lessen my depression quite a bit.

It makes me miss opiates so much when my anxiety holds me back. Today it took me an hour to get to a bank that was open and I couldn't make myself go inside when i got there. Recovery kinda sucks sometimes",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.90397865}"

I told my sister what's going on last night. I just met a new girl that I really like but she's starting to ghost me because she's an ex meth addict and I told her I've had some slips. I work full time and rent a place, for the first time in 4 years, thanks to a 4 month treatment program, which I used for the last month or so off and on until the last two weeks I was using every day. Graduated and came home with a habit I managed to kick. Only shortly to be replaced with a benzo addiction. Now I'm using both. I try to use minimal amounts and I don't use opiates every day but I do use minimal amounts of benzos every day as I'm physically dependant. (Clonazolam, usually  .5-1 mg a day sometimes  .25 mg. Lately I've been using meth too so I've used doses along the lines of 1mg or more a day. I don't have a lot left but enough to wean off, and I have Etizolam coming too. I'm not too worried about the benzos (yet), and I have 2 8mg subs which I know is enough for me to kick the shit. 

I want to try MAT because obviously something needs to change. I've tried Suboxone and I did not like it, and would like to try methadone. Only problem is I have to piss dirty. 

I know I could get and stay clean for two weeks. But to be told I have to be dirty to get into this program that is hopefully going to save your life.... I told them yeah whatever set it up, I'll make sure to fucking come in dirty. Hardly holding back my tears and puffy nose. 

I feel so defeated. 

I'd go back to treatment if I didn't have a job and just sign a lease for the first time in 4 years. I'm not ""that bad yet"" but I can see myself getting there quick.

Was able to leave work early yesterday Cuz we had extra ppl scheduled and I was feeling kinda shitty. Today we're likely gonna be closed all day Cuz of the rain. I went to bed early last night which was much needed but woke up earlier than I'd have liked and felt kinda toss and turn-y. I've been doing really good this last week or two but for whatever reason today the thought of doing drugs crept into my mind for the first time in like a month. Could just be Cuz I have that awful like restless churning feeling rn idfk. Still can't help but get a lil mad that when I finally get my shit together and am fine with living a boring comfy life is when the world decides to start veering towards the apocalypse. Torn between my love for mad max and my love for sleeping in a real bed, idk.  

In other news, I like never ever watch TV shows because my attention span sucks when it comes to things like that, but the German Netflix show Dark just came out with the 3rd and final season so I've been rewatching the first two and just started the third last night and im SO EXCITED HOLY SHIT. I like never ever get into shows and media like this so I like cannot shut up about it lol.  

How are y'all doing today? Well I hope 😊 this rain were having in the northeast is kinda nice kinda have the weird urge to go walk around in it. Have a good day everyone love y'all! 💜  

Edit: I totally glossed over what's actually on my mind so I didn't make the post all long and annoying but fuck it. I've been clean for 14 months now which is longer than I ever ever thought I could go not constantly chasing down some way to get high and fill the void. But sometimes I feel like going back to using is like inevitable. Like im just not made to live a normal stable life, like what im doing right now is me playing fucking pretend; a sham. I have all these dumb ass Hope's and dreams for the future and I have done really good for myself in this last year clean but as the world crumbles around me (I'm being dramatic here but lemme have it lol) it's hard to feel 110% for it when it comes to continuing doing what's right.  

I don't believe in destiny at all so it's hypocritical for me to feel this way but sometimes I do feel that I'm just destined to be a fuck up, to live on the fringes of society again, to have my only purpose be seeking out a way to get high. That life was fucking miserable and I lived it for over a decade (first few years was booze n drugs other than opiates alone) and never want to go back to it, I know I can snap myself out of feeling this way but sometimes getting those flashes of being like ""you're just a fucking junkie stop lying to yourself that's all your good at"" is just intense and a lot. Kinda related im not really a fan of that kid Juice WRLD music at all, RIP obv but his shit ain't really for me, however he has this one song/ video that just GOT me the first time I saw it- mostly on a personal level but also in relation to his death. People glorify addiction, us addicts even do it while we're using. Shit is sad but even in recovery glimmers of that feeling can arise. The video and song are really good but CW drugs and overdose.

however...in just the last two days, my mindset has completely turned around -- I got encouraging news from the engineering school that I'll be attending this fall, I found a new job after two months of being unemployed, and it seems like my husband and I are finally starting to make up after many many months of unrest.  I don't remember the last time I felt such hope and calm.  the chance that I might disturb this peace makes me slightly wary of relapsing...more like I don't even want to do it anymore.  I feel now that I have too much to risk for a weekend of nodding out.  my marriage is the strongest deterrent...there's a chance he'd be sympathetic.  but it is just as likely that shooting up again would undo our newfound understanding and reset our marriage back to the hell it had been for too long...or end us altogether.

I've got an important week coming up, one that will determine the rest of my year, and several years to come.  most of me says don't you fuckin do it ho...a small part wants it so, sooo badly.  one day couldn't hurt right?  but what if it does?  but nothing bad's gonna happen!  so why not?

I actually think thats half the battle is not reading into it too heavily when u quit, because last time I tried quitting 2018 I was miserable, spent days reading horror stories before jumping, and wound up immediately dependant on kratom before going back on subs when I started traveling for work.. this time when I quit I only posted here once when id quit the other week and stayed far away from any quit reports. 

My taper schedule: I was on 2mg bupe daily for a year, decreased to 1.5mg daily, then the next day down to 1mg. I kept myself at 1mg daily for a week, then jumped off for 3 days until the sweats and shits started, then had one or two last days of half a mg per day before stopping entirely. 

Things that helped/are helping me: exercise (I moved apartments during peak withdraw and was the first night I slept good that week), then homemade weed butter every other night before bed after that seriously worked wonders for sleep, thc dabs in the morning and before lunch, and an LSD microdose every 4 or 5 days to supplement some damn serotonin without getting dependent on another pharma med (no disrespect to those on antidepressants, im personally scared of them due to experience from family members, but know they work wonders for some).


The weirdest part about it all is i cant tell my siblings or parents to celebrate or at least explain why I was a grumpy jackass for the last 2 weeks. Im 28, just recently left my job, and they all think my last brush with opiates was a one time fluke in 2016 when I ODd on oxy and xans, none of them know how bad I was on H thru early 2017 before I switched to subs or that I was even on subs at all, Just wanted to share in case this gives someone the spark they need to quit <3",77,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48572105}"

Hey everyone, had a quick question for you guys that may have experience with this. I’ve been a regular opiate user for many years with some short stints in recovery here and there. I seem to do much better when I’m on Suboxone and going to my alcoholic anonymous meetings or narcotic anonymous meetings. Right now I have a good job but I currently do not have health insurance through them which makes everything way more expensive. I was seeing if any of you guys have any experience with getting Suboxone prescriptions with no health insurance?

I have looked at Suboxone‘s website and saw that they have a program for people without health insurance to maybe get it a little cheaper. I have also looked at GoodRx to see some different discounts that they offer and some of them sound really good but I don’t know if this is just a scam. If anybody has any suggestions on how to get on Suboxone without having to donate your arm or give up a finger I am all ears to listen to what you did.

I truly believe Suboxone is my best bet for long-term recovery. I don’t want to be on Suboxone for forever but I think it helps me a lot when I start out. The Alcoholics Anonymous group I’m in is pretty OK with Suboxone as long as it’s used as prescribed. I think a lot of these groups are coming around to know that some of these drugs have a great purpose in recovery and I feel like I found one that supports this idea. I appreciate any help any of you guys can give me and look forward to hearing your experience with this particular problem. Thanks!",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8004543}"

Two days clean.,"As of today, I’m two days sober. I last used Saturday at lunchtime. It was an RP 30. Wanting to put this drug addiction and constant life of spiraling behind me. I’m sick of feeling this weight of guilt in my stomach, disappointing myself, my girlfriend, my family, my boss, everyone is being affected. They don’t know only my girlfriend whose also going sober with me. Long story short I’ve been hooked on painkillers on and off for several years now. At first it was simple, so simple. A couple hydros here and there made my body feel warm it was great. At the time a good friend pushed me towards snorting diluadid. It was too much I puked every time. Yet, I’d continue to go back. Mind you I was 22 at the time. I was young, naive, and thought I’d never have an issue. Getting off them wasn’t too hard looking back I just got off. Then, a few months go by and next thing you know I’m popping hydros, perks, codeine syrup, etc. Also, an ongoing addiction to Xanax. Looking back it felt like I never was really “off” them. I never could go passed month 3 without relapsing. Didn’t even want to call it a relapse because it didn’t feel like an addiction. It felt like a different reality where I was safe guarded and I was okay. No problem holding a job, was confident, and felt ambitious for the future. Now, two years later I find myself upping the dosage I use to take and habitually using. Oxy, specifically provided me energy, enthusiasm, and I felt ready mentally sharp. I was kicking ass at work. My mind felt like I could tackle anything. But, looking back it felt like a blurry trail of 75% of what I could really achieve. Mentally, was continually telling myself I was achieving much more. I was blinded by what the drug was telling me. It feels hard to accomplish tasks like I use to. Where’s my enthusiasm for life? Why does it feel like an endless journey? How can I regain my excitement for life I once had? Feeling depressed, but hopeful that I can do this and make it to the other side. How do I not relapse on week 2? Or after 1 month? I’ve tossed all my paraphernalia out yesterday did a huge cleaning, detoxed myself the best I could. Now, being at work I can barely focus feel foggy, and it makes me immediately want to get an oxy to go kick ass at work again. But that’s not sustainable. I’m not broke, but I’m sure as fuck in a bad spot financially because of this. I feel sick to my core about my usage, the money spent, the hours wasted. Feeling sick like this just makes it that much harder. I know someone out there has gone through something similar, or is going through it right now. I want to not feel alone in this.

Got all the way up to 90mg then since about 6 months ago I'm down to 40mg. Yeah it's been a lil fast but I'm just sick of depending on something to make me happy or even okay ya know. I'm ready to be done with opiates all together. 

But that's not the real problem, about 4 months ago, I started talking to this girl I've known for over 13 years prolly. We messaged back and forth for about a week or two with deep conversation. Then we decided to hang out. The first night went AMAZING I MUST SAY. She even asked me back over the very next day after I got off work. And I said I'll be there. So that night, we ended up having sex. Was not suppose to happen at all but it did. And let me tell ya, AMAZING FOR THE BOTH OF US. So for the next 3 weeks I was over there every other day. Starting to really enjoy life again and gain hope back. I started to feel feelings again. Started to laugh at shit on TV again and just smiling for no reason through the day. 

Then she ended up moving into a new house, I helped her with all the furniture shopping and moving it in and setting up everything. Decorating the whole house basically. And for the next month serious I stayed with her every single night. It wasn't just me asking to stay. She wanted it to. She came on to me more than I did her because yes I'm still kinda fucked up in the head from 7 years of heroin use ya know. So emotions are flying high right now. And after that first month we are laying there one night after literally the BEST SEX I've ever had in my life and she tells me, ""You know I love you right???"" ""I really really do"". I have never met someone like you that is so sweet and so considerate to others and me and always worried about my feelings and if I'm okay. You are one of a kind and I couldn't see myself with anyone else. 

Well this change my whole mind set. I ended up thinking really hard on it for a day. Went back over the next night and told her I did love her to. So 3 weeks go by and things couldn't be better really. They are amazing. And she tells me one afternoon, we needa slow down a lil. I still wanna be with you but let's slow down just a tad. I said I would respect what she wanted and I would slow it down for her a lil bit. Then we ended up working out in the yard all the next day, and I've never showered with a woman before ever and I'm 29 :( I sad. But I like to save special invites like that for a woman I really love ya know. That means alot to me doing stuff like that. But she ends up getting in the shower with me and that was amazing to. Then 2 nights later we take a bubble bath together which is something I've never done either and she knows this. She was my first for ALOT of things and I was really falling for this woman. She is absolutely beautiful and amazing. Has a beautiful soul inside and out. Very caring. Just amazing. 

Well about 3 or 4 more weeks go by and she messaged me this past Monday and said she couldn't do this anymore. I wanted to get to serious to quick. But I wasn't the one that said I love you first. She was. She made alot of the first moves. It wasn't just me. She was throwing a bunch of signs of never wanted to have this end as well. So for the past week, I haven't really ate at all. I can't sleep more than 4 or 5 hours a night. I've cried so much this week that I'm so hurt today I can't even get a tear out. We just had big plans for this 4th if July for my first one sober and having find love. And it was all ruined. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, the past 7 years of heroin use, it killed me inside. I had no feelings. No emotions to anything. I wasn't happy at all. But when I met her, she gave me hope again. Taught me how to feel feelings again. Taught me how to love again. Helped me learn how to live life again and be happy when I've tried everything to be happy. She was a saving grace and a blessing all together. She said she knows I have no one. No friends or anything. And she would always be here for me and she still loves me and would do anything for me but she just can't get serious with me. But for this past week she hasn't even talked to me. And it's killing me. I guess you could say I started to get addicted to her w lil bit. I got into a new lovely routine. But now it's all gone and shatter. 

This has been by far one of the worst weeks of my life. The other one was my dad killing himself 7 years and sending me down the opiate path to numb it all. She was helping with that as well she knew everything about me and still accepted me and saw me for who I really was. This is the first relationship ive been in in over 5 years. So it's like all these feelings I've never felt before. It's like feeling them for the first time again. And God damn it man its been hurting me. I wanna use so fucking bad but I can't miss that up. I just can't.

I'm reluctant to go to them for help. I guess part of me is afraid they will cut me off but maybe that's exactly what I need.

I could not stop relapsing and if I did stop briefly... I would always go back. In fact, I would say things like I “can’t use again” I’ll die or theres no way I can relapse because I can’t afford getting sober again. Here is the truth. The evidence suggests for me that I always go back to heroin, meth, crack you name it. So what does “always” go back mean? No matter what I do left to my own devices I will eventually relapse again. For me that is the crux of the problem the mental states prior to a relapse despite all of my consequences (jails, relearning how to walk, psychwards rehabs ect.). This is what powerlessness means for me. So, by saying things like “I can’t use again” I am still trying to manage something I have no control over and just admitted 1 sentence ago that I am powerless!! Self will take back the show if you are not on top of how it manifests itself (usually resentment, pride, fear ect but that’s fourth step stuff!) so it kinda leads up to my favorite saying “what do you want to be when you give up?” Well, for most relapsing junkies this is the start of a surrender. A true surrender doesn’t happen from you, it happens to you. Ahhh ha! This is the magic moment at least in my experience with myself and people I sponsor! (I am available for sponsorship 484-548-4908 in AA) this magic moment does a few things. It provides “grace” for the real fucked up addicts like myself to give enough separation from drugs and alcohol to finish the steps. It all comes from this position of “I am completely fucked and I will always go back I have ran out of options on my on willpower”. Something like that. But the second beautiful part about that is the day I admitted I was completely fucked, I got unfucked. Happy freedom day!

I have had a long 5 years of getting myself into this hell that I seem to never be able to escape. I need help. I can’t do this anymore. I’m tired of waking up sick just to take methadone, liquid fucking chains. So much worse than having to stick a fucking needle in my arm 12 times a day to feel remotely normal. This detox is different for me. I’m only about 90 pounds now, I was 130 when I started. I’m withering away to nothing it seems. I’m on 65 mg and I am miserable. The only times I’m ok is when I’m sleeping, but the same reoccurring dreams for months and months where I’m in rehab or I’m at the methadone clinic. My withdrawal is something out of a movie. I wish I had words to describe what I was going through. I don’t. My boyfriend has been on opiates for way longer than I was and he doesn’t withdraw like this. My dad has been on opiates, multiple. Methadone and heroin. And he still doesn’t get as bad as me as quickly. I go into withdraw about 8 hours after dosing, whenever I was shooting it I would just stay sick. The only good feeling was that of the needle. I wish I knew what to do. I’ve never had a stable home, both of my parents are drug addicts, one in recovery and one that took me to the clinic. My mom is willing to do whatever to help me and not watch me suffer anymore. She was never addicted to opiates though. So she doesn’t quite understand. I feel alone. I feel tired. Sometimes I wish I could just go back on heroin to get me off of methadone. Of course that sounds dumb, but I don’t have any way of doing that anyways. I wouldn’t trap myself again.  I’m willing to go through this hell. I will face myself. I am just so scared. I don’t know where to go.. I’m from Kentucky. I’ve detoxed at many hospitals and I’ve been to recovery works three times in the last year. Everyone can give you a Sub detox about 12 hours after the opiates leave your system. Some earlier, depends on how much they care about watching you suffer. And since I’m on methadone there’s no telling how long this will be in my system so they won’t be giving me subs for a while. It’s like staring the devil in the eyes. Especially when you have felt so alone for so long and you’re already just so tired and jaded by everything. I don’t want a pity party. This is my complete fucking fault. Excuse my words but I wish I could really describe the anger, regret, and depression I face every moment of the day. I couldn’t go on a run if I wanted to right now. I couldn’t go when I feel the high from the methadone. As soon as I get outside in the heat I start feeling the hot flashes, I feel like I’m going to collapse. My body frame is too small. I feel like I’m dying. Sometimes I wish I had a terminal disease that gave me this pain because it would be easier knowing it wasn’t my fault, and that at least the pain would end. I don’t mean to be so morbid. I’m really ok, I’m not suicidal. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to get better. I want to get out of this hell thats keeping my soul and my body. I am miserable in ways that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. 

No matter how bad it is. Please try to be sober on your own if you are very young like me. This will keep you in the opiate trap forever... Different things work for different people. I thought that methadone saved me, at least I wasn’t shooting it anymore to survive. But now it is a lot worse, there’s nothing about this that makes me feel any type of hope anymore. I refuse to go up on my dose. It will only keep my longer. This is a fucked existence right now. I will take any suggestions. I’ll take any type of help anyone can offer. I know that eventually I have to bite the bullet. I’m more than willing to do that. I will suffer for days because it doesn’t compare to the suffering I’ve went through battling with this. Thanks for anyone who has read this. It means a lot. I kind of have nobody except for my mom and my boyfriend. I really need someone to tell me what I should do, where I should go. Every time I call a facility they don’t give me any info. I’ve been there enough to know that a lot of the people working there just want to get you in there, out of love I’m sure, and they don’t actually know anything about this indevidual detox. Anyone. Please. Even maybe a person to tell me it’ll be ok. Hope everyone is alright and well during this covid shit.

To keep things short, I’ve been addicted to pressed M 30s, which contain fentenayl. I’ve used these for about a month and a half or 2 months now, pretty much daily maybe aside from one or two days, and the withdrawals are just insane.

So i’ve officially tapered down to my last quarter, going from about a half to full pull a day to now just a half through the day. I have some liquid methadone, about 80ml i’d say. not much, but my friend said it should help with the withdrawals.

I’m 23, and this is my first and only addiction (besides gaming haha). Not only do i not want to keep tossing money into this crap of a habit, but i want to just be opiate clean as well and I’ve decided to take this month to try it.

My questions to you fine people;

-How long do you all think these withdrawals will last? after some brief research i see it can go anywhere from 10-20 days, which seems crazy to me but i’m willing to put my mind to it.

-How intense can i expect the withdrawals to be? from what i experiences from a days break would be irritability, cold sweats, insomnia and, ahem, diarrhea.

-In the cravings of a relapse, what are some recommendations you guys can give? I’ve made a list of things i want to start doing to occupy myself; lifting weights, taking hikes, hanging out with my girlfriend and going out etc. any other ideas?

2020-07-04 01:04:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hkxthk/methadone_my_experience_thoughts_regarding_this/,Methadone: My experience & thoughts regarding this controversial harm reduction treatment method,"A quick back story. I've been addicted to opiates for the better part of the last 13 years. I've tried every possible way to get clean that I have available at my disposal (I can't afford to leave the country to try one of the psychedelic experinces to allegedly reset my brain). My longest span of not using any mind or mood altering chemicals was in 2015-2017. 

 I attended my first 12 step meeting in 2008 and periodically would come around the program to try to string along 30/60/90 days of sobriety. 
I've done countless research on addiction to try to create my own solution.
I've tried moving to different cities, counties, and states. 
Living with others who don't have issues with drugs and alcohol. 
Living with those who are deep into the 12 step program and understand me better. 
Attending both impatient and out patient rehabilitation programs (attended 10 in patient rehabs ; only completed 2). 
I've been on Suboxone/Subutex therapy a handful of times which mostly ended up with me just selling them to support my habit. In the defense of these harm reduction options I would like to say I never followed medical professional recommendations in regards to attending therapy/meetings. I would just attempt to get on the medication In hopes it would a fix-all solution to my problems.


8 months ago I moved to a state which I had no connections or negative influences. Unfortunately, the first thing I did was unpack myself and all my negative destructive behavior. Soon enough I was weeks into using heroin daily again and developed a habit which would not be easy to kick on my own. Although I knew I would need additional help I tried a few attempts to quit cold turkey as well as trying other drugs to help transition into a sober future. As most would expect this method failed drastically and I found myself homeless in a state without any support network. Methadone has been a harm reduction method which I've heard nothing but negative talk about. Countless times I've heard how hard it is to get off of, how the withdrawal can last months. It's often thought of as a treatment method that is just a substitute and the same as using heroin off the street. Talks around the 12 step tables, at least where I'm from, is that ""you're cheating"" and ""not really sober"". All of these ideas kept methadone maintenance from even entering my conscious thoughts until I was laying in my tent not wanting to live this way anymore. I didn't want to die necessarily but I didn't want to continue living the way I was.

Keeping these thoughts fresh and thoughout the dreadful opiate withdrawal is nearly impossible. One benefit I knew about methadone was you didn't have to be clean off all opiates for a set amount of days prior to starting treatment. In the past I often failed to remain sober for the required days leading up to Suboxone (24-72 hrs) or Vivitrol (7-10 days). For those of you who don't know precipitated withdrawal will begin if either of those harm reduction medications are started to early. The ability to start methadone right away is the single reason I gave it a chance.I couldn't dismiss the longest used harm reduction method without at least giving it an honest attempt. I began doing research to see if clinics were in the area. To my surprise there are 3-4 where I'm currently living. I called them immediately, which happened to be 2am on a week night so assumed I'd be leaving a message. I was awestruck when the kindness woman answered and happily provided the requirements and additional details regarding the program. By 5am I was at the clinic and beginning the intake process. The intake process was a bit lengthy (about 4hrs) but I didn't care because I was so broken mentally a multiple day intake process would of been okay with me. Full disclosure: I did use heroin during the first couple weeks of methadone.  I don't think I was receiving enough methadone considering the habit I had when coming in. Withdrawal symptoms would slowly start after 12-16 hrs afternoo my methadone dose. Looking back on it the symptoms were mild and tolerable and I think it was more my brain wanting the real thing coupled with a deep addiction to using drugs via IV. I'm sure using while beginning methadone only made it harder to transition. After the first few weeks were behind me I was receiving a dose that worked for me. Only once in that time did I tell the staff I thought my dose was to high, considering I would fall asleep for hours after returning home from the clinic.  So there are times that you will need to be honest with yourself to determine if you are just using methadone to get high/escape reality or as a harm reduction
Method to better your life.

Once I began feeling good physically I was again started to get the urge to want more from life. My drive, energy levels and just pure thirst for growth and not wanting to be another statistic grew daily. I've began attending 12 step meetings again, listening to open talks, reading others stories of struggle and overcoming adversity, going to the gym regularly,  working, meditating, reading material on addiction/mental health/personal growth. 

I'm coming up on 3 1/2 months of only Methadone and I feel GREAT. I continue to go to 12 steps meetings and actually working the steps with a sponsor (there is an extreme disconnect between these nowadays). Those who think you can't have a spiritual experience or experience growth while on any harm reduction treatment methods please don't share your thoughts or options unless you have personal experience. It all comes down to the person, blanket statements don't work in recocery. All the years of people giving others on methadone the cold shoulder at meetings or discrediting them influenced my decision to not even give it a try myself for 13 years. Who knows where I'd be if I would of tried this years ago or maybe I had to go through all I did for a reason. Either way I hope this will reach at least one person who might be on the fence. Don't let the opinions of others hold you back from exploring recovery options. There isn't one specific road to a way of living a happy, sober and fulfilled life.  Be open minded, honest, and willing.
Remember how  blessed we are for all those who have an opportunity to get another shot at life because addiction hasn't taken yours early. 

TL;DR  Methadone has always been shown in a negative light in regards as a harm reduction treatment method. With a 13 year career in IV heroin use, I've tried MOST methods to achieve sobriety, never attempting Methadone until now.  I began intake 5 months ago and have transitioned to methadone exclusively for the past 3 1/2 months. From being homeless with nothing to slowly rebuilding my life... Again. I am hoping to shine some light on methadone as an treatment options.",38,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5760462}"

This post is an update for post I made 11 days ago.   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/heg582/cold\_turkey\_of\_920mg\_codeine\_daily\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/heg582/cold_turkey_of_920mg_codeine_daily_use/) 

So here I am... Typing out this post on the same PC that I did 11 days ago, but the difference today is that I'm CLEAN.  I finally did it! I'm alive and well. I'm back at work full time (after taking a week off) and now taking control of my life.

How do I feel? 

Physical Withdrawals are basically GONE. I am now in the Acute Withdrawal phase. It's an absolute roller coaster, emotionally. I have days where I am just flat, down and just want my own space. I also have days where I am up beat, happy and energetic, and sometimes a mixture of the two. 

This is normal as my brain is re-learning how to reward simple tasks and induce pleasure naturally. This will go on for some weeks, months. 

How were the withdrawals?

Pretty bad. I was cold and sweating bullets at the same time, I have really bad pain, I was agitated but this was mostly gone by day 5, so I'm lucky and grateful.

What did I take to help?

I went Cold Turkey. I used Magnesium, Vitamin C, Milk Thistle, Valerian Root, Propranolol 80mg per day, Ibuprofen and Lavender oil.   
I had Diazepam 4x 5mg per day **for ONLY 3 days** (I don't recommend this for those who can't control themselves. *This substance's addiction and dependence can creep up on you without you even realising.* Thinking back now, I really didn't need it).

Supports?

I have been so blessed to have the Support of close family at the start, then I came clean about it to my close friends, who did nothing but show love and support consistently.

I have also had the pleasure of quite a few of you reaching out to me directly to offer support, and I have made some life long comrads among you and you know who you are.

I also have scheduled counselling appointments and I attend ad-hoc NA meetings via zoom (due to my state lock-down).

Advice for anyone wanting to get off?

Not sure I'm qualified to give any, but here's my 2 cents worth. Be honest with yourself, to make sure you are quiting for the right reasons. You must WANT to do it so you can get your life back, because those who love you, want you back. In saying that, don't do it for others, your are going to WANT to do this for yourself first and foremost.

Have a plan. So schedule counselling, NA meetings in advance so by the time you can leave the house you are getting support right off the bat. If you don't have a long term plan, you are at GREAT risk of relapsing.

Also: I have about 2-3 showers a day which made my recovery much much better, as physically my body loved the hot water and mentally, I love the alone time, music and just time to reflect and think clearly (Even through the worst of the WDs).

So what now?

Now I feel like I've been released from a life sentence by miracle. I wake up, go to work and I'm slowly starting to feel normal again. I can feel, I can think clearly, I have emotions that I never knew I had. Outside of that I spend most of my time trying to be active, playing with the kids, and actually spending my time not thinking about when my next hit is going to be. I'm also going through the daily routine of exercise, taking supplements to restore my liver function and ensure I have no nutrient deficiencies to ensure my brain has a head start and speedy recovery.

I have made a decision when I quit on day one that I would never look back to that life. and I wont. For me, that life is OVER. 

A special thanks to  u/Elua7 for being my biggest support. Having you, has ensured that I remained focused on what I set out to do from day one. You are a genuinely amazing human and I can't thank you enough for the support you have given me and treating me like a brother/sister.

I’m currently putting together a detox toolbox and came across some from a back injury last year. Also indomethacin, its a prescription anti inflammatory pain reliever as far as I can tell. If anyone has any information it would be greatly appreciated. Btw I also have a couple suboxone strips but they only seem to make things worse even after waiting nearly 72 hours. A little background, I got clean from heavy iv heroin use in April 2016 However I relapsed this past Xmas and I’m trying to get my shit together before it gets any worse, for what it’s worth I’ve only been sniffing it this time, (yay me!) But I noticed things are a bit different these days. I was in suboxone for 5 years between 2008 and 2013/14 and I never had issues with it so I’m assuming it has to do with the garbage they are putting in the dope these days. Back then I could use the previous day, wake up sick and take a sub and it never caused PWS. I’ve also noticed that it seems to take almost a full 48 hours for withdrawal to really set in which seems strange because I remember my last run 4 or 5 years ago I would wake up sick every morning regardless of what time I used the day before. I didn’t think I was getting fent the past six months because it was never particularly strong and remember I was clean nearly four years so I had no tolerance, however it seems to stick around the brain for a long time these days. Anyway, I’m just trying to get off this hamster wheel before I lose everything and experience any more consequences, I just want my life back, I loved being clean and I’m really beating myself up for fucking up.

I felt like CRAP and wanted to say F**k it and just get high. BUT im not the old me anymore, this is the new me. I said F U to the old me. Pulled out my mountain bike and drove straight to my local trails, I rode a total of 5 laps, which consists of a 3/4 mile trail down (you start at the top) rode super hard and then a 2.5 mile long road back up. 

So after getting some miles in and being tired. I felt better, so much better, I almost felt high. It was amazing. It literally helped my mind body and soul. 

If you have access to a bike or any (sport) that will give you exercise that you enjoy. Please try it. It works.

Side note, I did crash on the last lap and landed on my shoulder and ribs. But im almost glad I did. I didnt once think to taking something for the pain. It actually feels good not being numb as weird as that sounds. I embraced the pain and it makes me feel a little more like a ""normal"" person and im enjoying dealing with it like a ""normal"" person, instead of running from it.

I could really use some input.","What are some tips or advice you'd give somebody in my position to maybe help me increase my odds of staying sober longer. I've taken subs so I'm not in physical pain, but mentally I am really struggling. I have no job, no car, nothing. All my worldly possessions are my clothes, a few pairs of shoes and the phone I'm writing this on. All my friends understandably distanced themselves from the fuck up junkie friend awhile ago. So I have little to no support system or strong base to fall on if I need it, which I do. I live with an immeasurable amount of shame and regret, my reflection disgusts me. The person I used to be isn't in here anymore, and I'm not too fond of the degenerate who came after.  My bed is 5 pillows on the floor with a sheet over it. I have not a penny to my name. 



I'm tired of all that being my reality. I'm tired of waking up and living the same day on repeat for the last 5 years. I'm tired of having to rip, run, or finess whatever to get well. And if I can't I spend all night in my luxurious pillow bed in utter agony flailing my restless legs while drenched in a cold sweat as I vomit stomach bile for the seventh time tonight into one of many half full Solo cups filled with water and cigarette butts. I'm tired of waiting on a dope boy who's been telling me ""15 minutes"" for the last four hours as I squirm in pain counting the seconds who knows I'll keep waiting because I am a god damned slave to the white powder he gives me wrapped in half a pick 3 lotto ticket. I'm tired of only feeling even the slightest bit content with life when I'm locked in the bathroom with my white powder and my headphones laying on the floor no more than two lines away from death but in my comatose state I get to leave my current situation and I can dream or think back to when things were good. I'm so fucking tired of being so fucking tired.



I will not survive if I continue like that. I will either die by my own hand, or overdose. I want to be normal, and have normal people problems. Like paying bills, or a fuck head boss or whatever. I want my friends back, and my life back. I want to look in the mirror and not utterly fucking despise the reflection in it. I want to find someone to love, and to be loved. I want to accomplish a task or goal and feel pride and feel accomplishment. I want to play video games again, I fucking miss video games so much. I want to go places with people and have experiences and make memories with people who love me and who I love. I want people to look at me like another person instead of some dirty subhuman junkie scum. I. WANT. TO. LIVE.



I'm still very very early into this, but I've never been so genuinely committed to never touching opiates again. I can't tell myself that I have to be sober forever. One because I know it's a fucking lie and two because I think alcohol, pot, and some softer drugs are completely okay in moderation or as a treat. Hell I could smoke crack cocaine for 12 straight hours, then put it down and not touch it for years. But I know I am completely and totally powerless and unable to responsibly or safely consume opiates, and I never will be able to. If I think I can get away with murder then I would go on a killing spree. So I can not under any circumstance put myself in a position where opiates are present or it's all but assured I will swallow, snort or smoke any and every opiate that comes into my possession.




Please give me any advice, personal experience, tip or trick, some profound shit the old guy in AA/NA said. a guide or book, A message you read in the stars during the winter solstice when the moon reached it's peak in the sky. Your fortune cookie. Anything I could do to fortify my resolve and feel completely steadfast in my current convictions. If I cannot make it work this time I doubt I'll see Christmas. And I don't wanna hurt my mom like that, she doesn't deserve it. And I'm sure a handful of other people would also be upset. But I've come to the conclusion that I personally feel my suffering is unbearable while living that way, I honestly and truthfully find death preferable to living that life.




This is way longer than I originally planned but I'm very emotional, needed to vent and if I'm honest I have nobody I could vent this to. So here it is opiates recovery.

2020-07-03 04:55:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/hkfoc9/life_polytechnic/,Life Polytechnic,"This was my experience of heroin addiction and recovery - I found it helpful to write about it and I hope someone might find it helpful to read about it. The title is a play on the old expression 'the University of Life' - for anyone reading who is not from the UK a polytechnic was a sort of second-rate learning institution, accredited to award degrees but with little of the academic or reputational merit attached to universities themselves.

I moved to London from the country in the autumn of 1999 with little more than the rucksack on my back, a place at university and £50 in my pocket - and a vague ambition to become a heroin addict. My student loan - a much less complicated affair in those days - was pending, and £50 back then went a lot further than it does now so I wasn’t worried about my reduced circumstances. I felt like a latter-day Dick Whittington, and as the titular character in my own rags-to-riches drama I was prepared for a few privations on my journey.

Like so many travellers before me, accommodation was my first concern. I had some family and friends dotted about the capital, but nowhere and with no one I wanted to stay. The struggle to find accommodation in London on a budget is well-documented so I won’t linger on my own experience, except to say that the situation then was not anywhere near as bad as it seems to be now - all things being relative though, and still with the proverbial provincial grass in my hair, the cost of renting a flat (or even a room) and the speed at which the rental market operated were daunting.

It was a mild October - an Indian summer, I suppose - and I had a sleeping bag with me so I gathered some cardboard for a makeshift mattress and found a spot to sleep in a stairwell behind the university. The entrance to the stairs was locked with a gate which I could hop over, and the stairs themselves were covered by a CCTV camera. In the stairwell I couldn’t be seen from the street and the gate and the camera (which may have been inoperable, for all I know) seemed enough of a deterrent to anyone wanting to join me down there. It was dry under the stairs in everything except very heavy rain, but the weather remained mostly warm and the evenings light until the first student loan payment landed in my account at the end of the month.

I found a room in an unfashionable area without a tube station, not far from the university. It was a bedsit in a boarding house where I was the youngest resident by far - the others were all much older men with depressing backstories who seemed to have fallen on hard times, for surely they would not have been in such a place at their time of life if things had gone better for them. I would learn later on however that this was not at all uncommon in London, and neither was it necessarily an indicator of misfortune, or a lack of ambition - it’s just how some people have to live.

The landlord was a parsimonious man who lived in the basement and was punctilious about collecting the rent money - something of a Rigsby character. The water in the communal bath and shower rooms was heated by a coin-operated meter in the hallway, the operation of which evidently triggered something in his basement rooms because every time someone turned the immersion heater on he would appear upstairs to make sure it had been switched on intentionally and electricity wasn’t being wasted. Despite his obsession with these details, however, he had missed the bigger picture which was the tremendous inflation of rental costs all over the capital, even in his obscure and ungentrified district. The cost of one of his rooms was far less than people would have been paying in the area five or even ten years earlier and as his tenants we entered into a tacit conspiracy to shield him from this knowledge, lest our fragile utopia be shattered.

My degree course was interesting without being too demanding and I was able to continue my routine of heavy drinking and hash smoking with little interruption. I spent a long time trying to find a reliable source of hash or weed and inevitably I gravitated towards Camden Town - the Amsterdam of London. While I invariably found something to keep my pipe warm I rarely got what I paid for - as the new kid in town I was always going to get ripped off, and I was scoring off the street where everyone selling cannabis seemed to be doing so to finance their heroin and crack habits. I considered myself experienced in the ways that drugs were bought and sold but this was a new world to me, and the stakes were much higher for the people doing the buying and the selling than in my home town. Of course I had long been aware of the influence of hard drugs but my provincial upbringing had shielded me from the worst of their effects, and my nocturnal wanderings around these less desirable parts of London forced me to confront the realities of the situation.

The capital had exposed its seedy underbelly and everywhere I went I started noticing disenchanted youths and embittered men and women gathering on street corners or huddling in bus shelters, waiting for their dealers to show up. Yet as much as this appalled and horrified me, I found myself in equal and opposite measure intrigued and fascinated. I had read Irvine Welsh’s ‘Trainspotting’ some years before and the ‘anti-glamour’ of it had enticed me - I thought that hard drugs must have something going for them if people were prepared to endure such hardship in their name. I told myself these were the very privations I had steeled myself to expect during my London adventure, and resolved to take heroin at the earliest opportunity.

Back at Camden Town I approached the shifty-looking individuals who gathered around the tube station. Rather like my earlier attempts to buy cannabis from them, my attempts to buy heroin were also unsuccessful - much as I had predicted they would be. I was not so naive that I imagined a middle-class white kid with a provincial accent could approach a perfect stranger on the street and negotiate a successful heroin deal without complication. Even armed with this knowledge, however, I still fell victim to my inexperience. Those I approached who offered to help me quickly revealed themselves to be untrustworthy, departing with my money and promises to return - I was on a number of occasions left in a stairwell at a block of flats, or on the corner of a back street, with instructions to wait while the ‘deal’ was put together. I am ashamed to recall that I would sometimes wait for an hour or more before concluding that I had been scammed - hope really does spring eternal in such circumstances. Others who I thought were genuine would not take my money or even speak to me - they muttered darkly about undercover policemen, and one even pulled my white-boy dreadlocks in an attempt to dislodge what he believed to be a wig.

Eventually I was approached by an older black man in a leather trench coat - ’The Matrix’ had only recently been released and he did not yet look absurd. ‘JJ’ had witnessed my clumsy attempts to score and took pity on me, taking me to a phone box where he produced a ‘stem’ - a tubular pipe - and some crack, which we smoked together. I’d taken cocaine before but experienced nothing quite like this, and in our reverie we formed a brief fellowship for which I have never understood his motivation - months later he was to disappear forever with £10 I had given him to get me some weed, but this amount was nowhere near the value of what we consumed that evening in the red telephone box. Later that night we found some heroin and in a serious breach of etiquette I took off without repaying the favour - perhaps this was why he had no compunction about his later disappearance with my weed money.

The heroin itself was a disappointment: I smoked it on foil but was unfamiliar with the technique and consequently wasted more than I smoked, carbonising the powder before the fumes had been released. It would be some time before I learned to take the drug effectively and economically, and it was only after several months of sporadic and ineffectual use that I decided to embark on a serious habit. I returned to Camden Town where I had befriended a homeless Scottish heroin addict called Mike, who had a large black dog called Heather. Although I had initiated this relationship as a means to an end I had genuine affection for Mike and Heather and to this day I wonder what happened to them - although Heather, I’m sure, will have died in the intervening years, and unfortunately for Mike I don’t imagine his life expectancy could really have been much greater. I briefly practiced Mike’s lifestyle with him, and funded some of it, and for my part I was grateful to have a partner in crime - this being a phrase which is much overused these days for people who are no such thing to each other, although in our case this is pretty much what we were. I remember him saying to me one evening that ‘crack had ruined the heroin scene’, which seemed a strange observation at the time, for what on earth could there have been to ruin? However I think now, looking back, that he may have had a point.

My bedsit was only a half-hour bus ride away but may as well have been on the moon after one of our Camden nights, and I often slept in the back of abandoned vans or in tower block bin sheds (the trick is to block the chute before settling down for the night) next to Mike and Heather. The difference of course was that when the fun was over and the hard times loomed, I could repair to my room and the relative normality of university life - while Mike had no such option. I had no wish to take him back to my place - he was an alcoholic and told me that he would wake up vomiting and in withdrawal, leaving him no option but to swallow his vomit in the hope that its alcohol content would recover him sufficiently to stumble to the off licence to get his first can of Special Brew. I did take him home once, however, and he immediately placed himself down directly in front of the TV, where he remained all night. He looked around occasionally to grab a can or chase some heroin, but after so long on the streets it was the TV that held his attention.

I see now that addiction had put Mike on the street and that living on the street was in turn preventing his recovery from addiction - the twin problems of his homelessness and drug and alcohol use were inextricably linked, but at the time such an observation would have escaped me entirely: we were just drug users, that was all, and I had a place to stay and he didn’t. The following morning he waited impatiently for me to get up - I doubt he slept - so that we could continue the session, or ‘get back on it’ as we didn’t say then. I wasn’t feeling good and wanted only to sleep more - I didn’t have his appetite for self-destruction - and he left in a huff with Heather, who he had to carry down the stairs because her back legs were going by then. Like JJ, I never saw Mike again - a theme was developing.

I next visited a hospital in North London that operated a drug treatment centre: they provided me with needles and literature about harm reduction, safer injecting techniques and related injuries and diseases. I no longer needed to travel to Camden at this time, having met another homeless addict outside the supermarket near my home who introduced me to two much older, seasoned heroin users - Katie and Adam. Also from Scotland, they were a double act who lived on my road and took me under their wing - they would often see me making my way up our road, coming back from university (they were never awake to see me on my way there) and would call me up to their top-floor flat for a smoke. They introduced me to a local network of dealers which was to be the next stage of my downfall - the distance between the place I lived and the place I scored (notwithstanding the odd night in a bin shed) had been the greatest protective factor against the steadily increasing frequency of my drug use, but now I could score virtually on my doorstep.

I started buying my heroin from Katie and Adam and injecting at home - I never did it around them, for fear of contaminating a needle or an injection site in the unhygienic and unsafe chaos of their flat. I initially injected tiny amounts, so concerned was I of overdosing; a seasoned addict would have laughed at the measures I cooked in my spoon, but had I overdosed in my bedsit it could conceivably have been many days before someone found me: probably it would have been my landlord after his rent. Nevertheless I got myself incredibly high - although probably ‘low’ would be more accurate - even to to the point of having to walk myself around the room like a horse with colic, in order to prevent my eyes rolling back into my head and the drug taking me from consciousness. I didn’t realise at the time that ‘gouching out’ can be one of the more pleasurable side effects of heroin use, but it speaks volumes for my naivety and ignorance that I believed if I passed out following an injection I wouldn’t wake up.

My life became a ritualised sequence of wait-score-inject-sleep-repeat. I stopped attending university, I lost contact with my friends, I blew my student loan and my arms and the backs of my hands became dotted with puncture marks and grew bruises the size of eggs. Despite the many fresh veins I had to choose from I was not adept at injecting and I probably wasted more heroin than I ever managed to shoot into my arm. Eventually I missed a vein and accidentally shot my fix into the soft tissue of my upper arm: a large lump appeared and on visiting the GP I was told to keep my arm elevated above my head for forty-eight hours or risk amputation. It occurs to me now that the doctor was perhaps playing a trick on me in order that I might take some time to reflect on my situation - certainly this period triggered in me what I believe alcoholics refer to as a ‘moment of clarity’, wherein one is compelled to question the wisdom of one’s actions. I subsequently stopped injecting heroin but continued smoking it for several more months until my student loan ran out.

There was no question of committing acquisitive crime to fund my addiction, so once the money was gone that was that. Again this was something that separated me from the few people I knew on the scene - I had been playing at it, really, flirting with it, and when all was said and done I would head home and resume my old life. This was not an option for the people I met during this time - this was not a diversion from their life, but the actual life that they were living every day. This was a sobering reflection and the thought that accompanied me as I drifted away from them and out of their lives.

I managed the withdrawal symptoms with codeine linctus, a preparation that used to be available from pharmacies as a cough syrup and is now enjoying a resurgence as a recreational drug in America where it is known as ‘lean’ or ‘drank’. It’s much harder to get hold of in the UK these days, largely because the only people buying it were heroin users trying to stave off withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively I would buy kaolin and morphine, another over-the-counter preparation intended for the prevention of diarrhoea but equally effective at managing withdrawal symptoms. The morphine is separated from the kaolin suspension by refrigerating the bottle until the morphine separates and rises to the surface, where it can be drawn off and drunk or - with some preparation - smoked (I had read about this in Will Self’s short story ‘Scale’). As a last resort I would take codeine tablets from my parents’ medicine cabinet at their home, the downside being that many brands contain high doses of paracetamol preventing the user from ingesting large numbers of tablets at any one time. My heroin use didn’t stop entirely at this time, but I learned to only use it intermittently and never for more than three days at any time - my body never forgot the old days, and punished me heinously every time I slipped up. For all I know it still would today.

In the end I finished my degree - a lot later, and at considerably more expense than I would have liked - and left London. I always intended to return, perhaps to resume where I had left off, but life gets in the way and probably just as well that it does, sometimes. However for many years afterwards I remained acutely aware of the presence of heroin wherever I went. I had developed a sort of spidey-sense that would tingle whenever I saw a rat-faced youth lurking furtively in an alleyway, or a teenage cyclist with bulging cheeks pedalling frantically along a canal towpath. It seemed to be everywhere I looked and I would have given anything not to notice - I never used to, and it got in the way of my recovery. It was a long and lonely road to find my way back from addiction and I didn’t feel that I was entitled to any sympathy or congratulations on my journey, because I knew that I never should have fucked it all up in the first place. Despite everything I don’t really have any regrets - heroin addiction was not the worst thing that has happened to me, and if I could do it all again knowing what I know now, I really don’t think that I would have done it much differently. A little more education on the pitfalls of injecting and better preparation for withdrawal episodes, maybe. I had a lucky escape - a series of lucky escapes - which really were down to luck rather than judgment, but the experience illuminated a dark side of the street that I otherwise never would have noticed, and I really can’t say that I would have wanted to miss out on that.

These days I have a professional career and even worked in a substance misuse service for a while, but my personal experiences did not stand me in such good stead in the profession as I'd hoped - I had the habit of seeing people's experiences in terms of my own, and struggled to understand how people who had clearly long ago arrived at the conclusion that drug use was ruining their lives could not stop repeating this harmful behaviour. I think now that the difference for me was in having a strong 'first world' - supportive family, secure housing, good education, employment and relationship prospects - that drugs took me away from, and which I always knew was there to return to when I'd finished fooling around on that dark side of the street. If that hadn't been the case and drugs were helping me to shelter from a cruel, hard world that I had no desire to return to I don't know how I would have found the emotional resources to stop using.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6017025}"

I’m deep in it and I just have no motivation for anything. I don’t really even get too much enjoyment from using. I just try to get to the point in the high where i can feel contentment which keep taking a higher dose to reach. Opiates suck my soul from me. I feel like if I did die it wouldn’t be that much of an issue. I feel like that’s how people overdose. They lose a reason to live. Am I crazy?

I’m addicted to pain pills... man I’ve never written that down before. I’m a woman in my 30’s with a professional job that I’m currently on furlough for but have to start making moves very soon to change that. I’ve been wanting to quit this shit for a while but finally received the push yesterday/today. My best friend broke my heart over one fuckin 30 that’s all I am worth to him. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I don’t want my heart broken by people who care more about drugs than friends anymore. I’m fuckin sick of being depressed, sick of being anxious, sick of being so alone and isolated, sick of running out and w/d, sick of wasting my money, sick of hiding, sick of my life, sick of myself. 
I have so box strips that help with the physical w/d but not the associated depression from detox, kratom and a connection to a supply, small Rx for Xanax and the potential for some bars!, a connection for clonidine, but not very much of a support system at all. 
I guess that’s why I’m here. Rehab is not a possibility due to my profession but with the right tools and support I can do it without medical intervention in that manner. I’m looking for support and accountability and mutual connection that’s not tied to what people can get from me. 
First challenge I faced was a walk I just took- it was nice and pumped me up to write this. But the REAL challenge is to NOT go get more pills when the dude gets back to town today. I’m probably about 48 hours in and have been taking strips and kratom. What now.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78862876}"

Things have been okay, other than having to just fight those ""I used to use right now times"" and filling it with something else. 

Today one of my hooks reached out to me and asked me if I was going to reup, I told him I was good. He messaged back asking if I was positive because this time he got 500 yellows (norcos). I told him i was good. 

Later on he messaged me asking if I was sure ""because he's got a couple people interested and doesn't know when he'll be able to get more"" keep in mind, over the last two years I would buy anything and everything him and another person had as soon as they got it. 

Later on he followed up with me again just confirming I was sure that I didn't want them. I told him the same thing, but this time he told me ""sweet, now im stuck with these because I bought them assuming you would buy them all.

I told him sorry man dont know what to tell you, but tomorrow,  the next day and a month from now the answers going to be the same so politely stop reaching out to me about this and he kept pushing it. I just said no thanks. Take care. 

This is a huge win for me, before I would run straight to the bank and take a handful of cash over to meet him to buy him out and then the same with my other guy, but today was so freeing, i didn't drop what I was doing,, I wasn't running to meet him, didn't have that stress of keeping up my supply, no stress about having enough on me for a long day, that can possibly run longer than planned. None of that, like a huge negative weight was lifted off my shoulders. 

(Not to mention the money I've already saved since 6-24)

I did sub treated before with a decent period of clean time after A LONG hard run with opiates, but this time it feels different. I went from taking 20-30 pills a day, EVERYDAY for over two years (this time around) to taking 2mg in the AM and a 1 ish mg before bed without so much as a craving. 

I guess I could have made this much shorter by saying im doing okay. I got this. 

Thank you guys, i lingered here for months reading and reading and decided to do it because so many of you reminded me it was impossible. I know you dont know me but you saved my life.

I have been an oxy addict for a couple years. Over the last 6 months I have been a low dose .5 mg Suboxone user to great benefit. Sadly , I buy black market, and it has unexpectedly run dry . I haphazardly found connects for Xanax and meth today as I was having the start of withdrawal. I took a bump of meth early in my shift , got what I needed to get done at work done, and then took some Xanax to chill out after work. My cocktail has me at a functioning baseline. The two worst symptoms for me in withdrawal are lethargy and anxiety, they are why I got addicted to those damn pills in the first place, to improve work performance not be sedated in  They relieved all the pain, stress and fatigue from running a restaurant by myself. Now I have no intentions to do this long term. My idea is if I can get thru the weekend which would be excruciating cold turkey , then 4  days or so go into the cold turkey. For context , I have no tolerance to stims or benzos and have never enjoyed them. I fully realize this is playing with fire for someone who knows they have addictive tendencies, but I don't think I will develop a habit because I simply just don't enjoy the effects and I am highly motivated to get clean. My question is as anyone experimented with this combo, especially as a way to deal with acute withdrawal while having to maintain a demanding workload, and what were the pros and cons?

Everything is dull and boring. Even playing video games feels like a chore. I work every day, and I feel like a zombie on my commute and throughout my shift. I've picked up cigarettes again as a minor comfort. Don't even really have fun smoking weed. 

Only thing stopping me from picking the lock on my mom's safe and stealing a few more pills is my partner. They've been so patient and compassionate and no one has ever cared about me as much as they do and I can't keep hurting them. They told me they can't stand seeing me throwing away the inches of progress I've made again and again. I don't want to lose them. But god, how much longer can I live like a shell of a person before I break?

I had this feeling after I got through withdrawals last time I was heavily using. But I was at school, I was seeing friends regularly, I kept busy with a part time job I really liked, and my partner was there with me through most of it. And I didn't have easy access to any more pills at school, so I figured I may as well just get better. I don't remember it being this hard.

The only time I have been smiling is when I have to do my customer service facade at work, and occasionally when I talk to my partner on the phone. I'm supposed to go to a ""beerlympics"" party with a bunch of my coworkers next week. Initially I was really looking forward to it but right now I just want to cancel on them. I don't have the energy for that.
