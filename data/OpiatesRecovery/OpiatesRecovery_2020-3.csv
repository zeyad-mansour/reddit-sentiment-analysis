A family member (let’s call her Jill) has been on Methadone for 20 years. It was originally prescribed by a doctor for migraines, but the doctors office was shit down 4 years ago after being investigated for being a pill mill. Since then, Jill has been going to a methadone clinic and paying $112 per week. She has since lost her house, her job, and seemingly all motivation.

Her unemployment ran out last month and she can’t reapply until August. She has been unemployed for over a year and is not getting many call backs, especially with the COVID-19 stuff happening. She also seems to lack motivation to truly put an effort into finding a job and didn’t even start applying until a couple of months ago.

Since she lost all income, she is relying on me to pay for her methadone each week, which is putting me further and further into credit card debt.

I can’t do this anymore financially, but I don’t want to see her suffer from going cold turkey. She’s in her 50s with no health insurance. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",3

Since december ive been jumping through the hoops that my insurance and the gastro set up. Like staying clean for 6 months with regular u.a's and showing that your active in your recovery.

Still taking kratom 30 gpd & it’s completely destroyed my life. I have set up a plan to kick this habit soon as it’s at its end with me. My SO kicked the same heroin habit the same way only kratom has never really built an addiction to her body she’s one of those who could just stop it whenever. 

I’m already setting my plan up to detox, planning to get back in school etc. 

Well my SO has had a severe toothache for weeks now, starting at the beginning of COVID lockdown. She has called & called to see an emergency dentist & they say they’ll call back & set her up but they never do. She calls back & nothing ever happens. She’s resorted to her primary physician which prescribed her antibiotics, & painkillers... (she was drug tested to attain the prescription, she legitimately needs them)

One reason kicking the habit has been so easy (with exception of having nasty kratom) for me is bc I’ve not had access to the actual drugs. I don’t hang around anyone with them. And it doesn’t bother me until I know I *can* get them. I’ve told her to keep them away from me & I don’t want to know about them. But still it’s on my mind & she will ultimately give me some if I ask. This is horrible bc she needs them. I shouldn’t be thinking this way, I’m a cruel horrible person & it should be so easy for me not to entertain any ideas of having meds she needs....& yet it’s like oh well we could just have a nice party together, it’s only one night huh? This sucks. 

I’ve been closeted about my addiction the whole time, no one has ever known other than my SO. So I have no support & no one other than her I can talk to.",5

Hi all. I just started suboxone maintenance on Thursday (16 mg/day). I was living in transitional housing and had 6 months clean, I was doing really well. Last Friday, I got a Xan from a fellow coworker and was off and running from there. I hit the streets and had a 30 hour binge using all the dope and hardware that I could get my hands on. I blew through my whole bank account and only stopped the binge because I got arrested and have a pending charge for possession of Heroin, crack, paraphernalia, and prescriptions that were my buddies (my first offense). I have gone through the whole Vivitrol thing many times but always skip my shot; so I am now giving suboxone MAT a try. I can’t move into any transitional houses while on this treatment so I’m staying at my parents until further notice. I’m 21 years old and I’m worried, I want to get sober but I haven’t been able to because I can’t help but always have reservations in my head to use. The Subs seem to have been helping the cravings since I started but I still crave that euphoria I get from dope. Anyways, I appreciate this forum and would like to congratulate you all for getting sober. Thanks and wish all of you a happy and joyous life.",6

Another beautiful day in quarantine 😑 I'm soooo stoked for my school to start back up online on Tuesday. Finally something to give me more of a sense of purpose, thank fuck. Yesterday I did an hour of yoga, did some fun colorful makeup, walked the dogs, did some drawing + podcast listening, made really good roast chicken  n potatoes with asparagus, and gave myself a lil spa hour in the bathroom again (ie doing face masks, listening to more podcasts, and smoking a joint while laying on the bathroom floor with my yoga mat and neck pillow lmao). Slightly better than other days in terms of productivity but still not great and real fucking far from my normal standards.  

I actually had a legitimate craving last night while I was sitting in bed it was fucking weird. Not enough to actually make me contemplate attempting to go cop or anything, but definitely like a sharp kinda spike in my brain that was like ""you know what would make this antsy pent up feeling go away? Heroin would make it go away"". I shook it off and got over it but man it's been a long ass time since anything of that nature has happened to me, at least that strongly. This quarantine im guessing just hits close to home for a lot of us, as in being reminiscent of the days we used to spend isolated inside away from the world focused on nothing but getting high.  

I dunno. Im hoping I can use the motivation from school as momentum to get other shit done. I've always been pretty all or nothing about life in general (def not always a good thing, more often than not a bad thing, lol) so hopefully this can shift me out of the nothing into the all. Tbh I'm hoping there will be some type of video conferencing involved just so I have a better excuse to actually get dressed and do my makeup!  

On another note. My home city of NYC, my motherland, the place I love most in the world and is an integral part of my identity, is getting absolutely ravaged right now. As well as a huge number of laymen, doctors, nurses and nursing assistants, orderlies and paramedics are getting diagnosed in huge numbers, sometimes having to return to work despite a positive test due to sheer lack of personnel. My heart fucking hurts for our brothers and sisters on the front line, going into battle with this virus without the protection they need. They did not sign up for this. No one in their right mind would sign up for this. Sure, they knew if (when) a pandemic came they'd be busting their asses, but not with a disgustingly callous (on the part of government and hospital admins) lack of PPE.  

NYC is really in the trenches right now and I wish I could do something but I don't know what so in true desperation I've been praying for them, as well as all the healthcare workers across this nation and world, every morning when I wake up. I pray for everyone else on the front line without PPE too- grocery store workers, janitors and sanitation workers, infrastructure workers, even police- despite the typical hatred I reserve for them, they have done and are doing a lot to help deal with this situation, at least around my neck of the woods, and many of them are interacting closely with sick people and the general public with no PPE. I only pray when it's fucking dire straits. I am a nihilist in the true sense of the word but due to my religious upbringing my brain will default and start praying in really severe situations. Never did I think I'd live through a time so severe that I'd wake up and pray every morning.  

Well, I hope everyone is hanging in there. To those who have been trying to avoid news etc of the virus, understandably so, sorry for my rant. It's just really been weighing on me- no human should have to be in the position that we, apparently the richest and ""most developed"" industrialized nation in the world, have put our front line workers in and it just kills me that there's nothing I can really do. If y'all would prefer to keep the virus talk to a minimum (as in news about or relating to it, not the effects of it like shutdown and quarantine,seeing as that pervades all of our daily lives to the extent where it would be near impossible to avoid mentioning it) let me know and I will try not to mention it, if there's a wide enough consensus maybe we can make a few loose ground rules or make a covid related questions/ venting weekly or daily sticky post like some other subs have done if the other mods think that might be a good idea. Im always down to keep this sub as minimally regulated as possible which historically has been fine but if y'all do feel a type of way please let me know!  

Man this was way longer than it was supposed to be. Ah well y'all know me by now it always is. 20 days until im a full year clean, yay! Love y'all, hang in there, and have a good one. 💜",5

Hoping I don’t break any rules. I apologize if this post is all over the place. 

So I had almost 2 years heroin free with the help of a suboxone maintenance plan. It was a blessing and a curse to be honest. I ended up losing my health insurance about 3 weeks ago and was forced to wd cold turkey from 6mg of Suboxone (was previously on 12mg/daily)

I live with my father who I love so much. He’s currently undergoing chemo treatments for stage-4 non small cell lung cancer. This disease will unfortunately probably kill him soon. He is also an addict who had about 3 years up until recently.

Long story kind of short, after being prescribed a heavy amount of Oxycodone because of pain due to his cancer and chemo treatments, my father ended up relapsing on heroin and crack cocaine. While undergoing chemo. While self quarantined because of his weakened immune system...

You guys, I lost it. I was so upset he relapsed. Mainly because I love him so much and seeing him hurting himself while going through this incredibly difficult time broke my heart.
I was also upset because we don’t have much money and I got laid off from my job because of COVID 19 while he’s buying drugs and I’m scrambling to keep us afloat.
While simultaneously enduring horrific acute withdrawals from a 2 year suboxone prescription. I’ve been craving really badly to say the least, this pushed me over the edge.

I relapsed a little over a week ago. My dad and gf, currently staying with us, don’t know this. It’s been I believe 4 days since I last used. I’ve been taking kratom to help ease the worst of it which has been a blessing. (Though I know this too is physically addictive and I will need to stop)

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don’t want to use anymore, you guys. I know all of us, all over the world are struggling right now and to those of you who have been strong enough to stay clean through this difficult time, I have infinite respect and admiration for you.

If anyone has any advice or even just some encouragement, it’d mean the world to me. Sending love to all of you. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",12

I am usually only sleeping 3-6hrs a night though. The physical symptoms are what's bothering me the most right now. I still have very little energy, I'm sweating more than usual, and I often feel like I have a chill. Before detoxing I would run pretty much every day. Now I get exhausted almost immediately. I'm still making sure to walk at least a few miles a day though. I'm wondering how long for you guys it was until you regained a sense of normalcy? On Wednesday or Thursday I really started to feel better, but the symptoms described above have not been subsiding as quickly as I expected. On a side note I was prescribed Lucemyra and Gabapentin to help. I've been taking 1-300mg Gabapentin per day but i'm stopping that now too because I don't want to become dependent on that, and I'll be reducing my dosage of the Lucemyra over the coming days as well.

Had therapy over this video chat app yesterday.. was difficult to convey to my therapist the kind of stuck, deer in headlights way I've been feeling, but I think I managed to get it across and she explained to me this certain way to look at the things im doing to mitigate my need to constantly feel productive, like don't get down on myself if I'm not doing something that results in output all of the time; but as long as whatever I'm doing somehow furthers me towards a value or priority of mine, don't get down on myself. Dunno if I described it in the best way but I think it's a good middle ground and a realistic way to go about things for me.  

Also finally wrote out a daily routine with times and set alarms on my phone for it and everything so im hoping my self discipline can pick itself up a lil bit. How is everyone else doing? The new season of Ozark came out on Netflix!! Its so rare that I actually get into a drama type TV show but Rs brother and his gf recommended this to us a while ago and we figured why not try it, ended up being one of my favorite tv shows.

I have been home a week at my moms(super thankful), and my entire aftercare plan fell apart due to the virus. I had outpatient scheduled, but it was canceled, and obviously AA meetings are canceled as well. 

I had a high tolerance before i went in, about 3g of tar, 2g of powder, or ~1400mg of oxy daily to stay well, with 8-10mg of xanax daily. trying to get clean for the past 10 years, had 1.5 years clean in 2018-mid 2019. 

i did a 5 day sub taper at detox, and was planning to not be on MAT, but been struggling at home, so been taking 1mg of subutex every other day(dose in morning, skip next day, and redose, basically 48 hours apart). 

i know i am basically getting dependent on the subs again, but with 1mg every 48 hours, will that be a hard habit to kick after the virus? 

I have a bunch more questions, but my mind is so very confused right now, with my aftercare plan in shambles. just looking for any advice or support, thank y’all 🙏",2

I'm 38f with 13 years alcohol sobriety as of  March 5 2020. After my csection in 2012 I got hooked on pain meds. 3 months later,  caught my exhusband involved in a soft porn shoot and he blamed my pain pill use. Went to rehab voluntarily to save our marriage, checked out 30 days later, felt renewed.. but reality set in again. He was a nightly whiskey drinker.. and after a hernia surgery I had 6 months later I thought I could hide my pain pill use. I received positive reinforcement at first for being a better wife and mom, coworker, happy to do it .. focused.. but 8 months later I got sloppy .. I couldn't maintAin it. I had needed more and more y'all know the story. I signed up at a pain clinic to get suboxone b4 I was found out but it was too late. Nodding off at my exhusbands family get together and the next day he took my 1 year old away. Since his family is well known ... long story short, despite my follicle tests to prove myself clean, the at litem said I was still on an opiAte since I took suboxone and my ex got physical custody /I have to pY support although we do have my son almost the same aMount of time. 

Fast forward 7 years and I've met a man I never believe existed for me. A man of God and integrity. 
Ive quit vaping (nicotine) dec 27.. and was working out b4 I got pregnant. (Surprised but a blessing)
He hasn't taken so much as a Tylenol in 17 years although he drinks wine a few times a week... although hes supportive of my cessation of everything, he has trouble understanding he difficulty.  He's not an addictive personality

Back to me- I've been on subutex and/or suboxone since the end of 2013 an d it's taken a toll on my body. My hair is thinner. Overall I look like Ive aged 10 years in the 7.. 
Doctors need to encourage a slow taper plan after a couple years max.. while offering other meds to temporally offset wd symptoms. My doctor would have just let me stay on it Forever I guess.. going on 7 years 

Hpwever I'm 6 mo pregnant and finally had the umption to do a taper over ten weeks off subutex down to 1/2 mg per day (each drop was a little difficult here and there) but now by the Grace of God Yeshua Jesus it's been 15 days
W nothing but black seed oil, folic acid, and some expired klonipin (1mg) to sleep... Wd symptoms were not too bad after first few days (rls was terrible and the general discomfort feeling was rough at 72 hours ) but I feel like I'm over the mountain.,, except for now this .. profound lack of motivation,, problem feeling pleasure (o have gestational diabetes so i can't even eat chocolate and ice cream lol) just SO lethargic it's unreal, shortness of breath.. general depression.

Thankfully I don't have a desire to use but this isolation is killing me. I thrive on pressure, I need pressure to be motivated and get shit done. Probably one of the reasons I got good grades and was one of the ~best employees~ at my job. But now that it's just me and all the time in the world, I feel utterly useless. I feel like I don't even exist if I'm just cooped up in my house. Like what's the fucking point. This year was the year I fell in love with the world and realized how much cool shit was out there that I could just enjoy by myself; without the companionship of a subculture or partner. And now that's all out the window for now and the unforeseen future.  

 What is something you're grateful for during this shitty time? Im grateful for my dogs, for my job actively trying to help us laid off employees, and for an apartment with multiple rooms and no roommates. What are some fun/ funny things you've done that prob wouldn't have happened without the quarantine? (CW CANNABIS) Last night I rolled myself a joint, took my neck pillow, my yoga mat, and a low lamp light into my tiny bathroom, lit some incense and put a podcast on my speakers and did a face mask and shaved my legs while laying on the floor pretending I was at a spa, then took a nice long hot shower afterwards. As I was gathering all the stuff to bring into the bathroom I was laughing my ass off like ""girrlll this some quarantine ass shit right here"" 😂 I'm sure im not the only one finding creative ways to ""repurpose"" rooms of the house!!  

Well, I hope everyone is hanging in there. The weather today is nice so I'll prob take dogs on a long walk. Only thing is they get aggressive pack mentality towards other dogs when they're together (which is 99.9% of the time) and I know mad other ppl gon have the same idea as me and have their dogs out too.

2020-03-25 22:31:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/fp3l6u/having_problems_with_my_sponsor/,Having Problems With My Sponsor,"Hey guys, I haven’t posted here in a while, but I really gotta get something off my chest because I’m really frustrated and pretty fucking angry right now. I’m coming up on nine months clean and I got a sponsor about three or four months into my recovery. I’ll admit, I kind of jumped in and just asked someone to sponsor me without really knowing her. I realized it wasn’t a good fit about two or three weeks into sponsorship, but I’m bad at ending relationships, whether it be friendships, romantic relationships, or in this case, a sponsorship.

One of the first things that I noticed was that we only ever talk about her and her issues. We’re five months into this, and I don’t think she knows a damn thing about me. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve managed to tell her some details about myself, my life, and what led me to seek recovery, but she doesn’t remember anything I tell her. I dread talking to her on the phone because she talks about her problems for over an hour, complains about the people in the NA groups we attend together, and then hangs up. She also doesn’t respect my time. She’ll call me at work and I’ll tell her I only have a couple minutes, but she traps me on the phone. Short of hanging up on her, I can’t end the conversation. I’ll say I have to go, and she’ll just keep talking.

Anyway, a few months back, we had a business meeting after our regular NA meeting. I won’t go into details, but she had a verbal altercation with the other members. Usually after this particular meeting, we would all go out to eat. It was one of the only things I looked forward to at the time. She seemed to have made up with the group members and said we could still go out to eat, but then she held me back as everyone else left and started ranting about how everyone in the group was out to get her. She kept me there for forty-five minutes and we missed the after-meeting hangout. I drove her home, went to a fast food restaurant, and ugly cried alone in the parking lot while stuffing my face with a cheeseburger. It felt like I was robbed of the only thing that was keeping me sane at the time.

A couple months later, the same thing happened again. She got into another argument with the group members, she kept me from hanging out with them, and she complained about them to me for about an hour. These people are my friends, my fucking life lines. And she shits on them constantly. Saying shit like “oh, that’s not how NA is supposed to work”, like she works a perfect program and no one else does.

And tonight was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Because of COVID-19, one of the groups I attend has been holding Zoom meetings. It was going great until it was my sponsor’s turn to share. Something on her end wasn’t working properly, so we couldn’t see or hear her. The woman chairing the meeting said that we would come back to her and let someone else share so my sponsor could figure out her technical difficulties. She got pissed off and left. Then came the tidal wave of angry texts. She was texting me saying “fuck these people, they cut me off, they wouldn’t have done that if it was someone else”. I understood why she was upset, I know she had something she wanted to share because she had told me all about it when I called her this afternoon. I was on the phone with her for an hour and a half and that was the only thing we talked about. And I’ll say it again, I called her. Not once did she ask how I was doing or say anything involving me or my recovery, other than to say “you haven’t called in a few days, you worried me”. Anyway, I tell her that we couldn’t see or hear her, and that I understood her frustrations. I was going to tell her that I would attend another meeting with her that night so she could share. But before I could, she started getting angry with me. The person who has listened to her rants and to her talking about her problems for months. The person who drives her to meetings multiple times a week, every week. The person who helps her cool down when she’s having problems with someone else. And she was fucking giving ME attitude? She was angry at ME? Fucking really? What the fuck did I do? Plus, I’m her SPONSEE. I’m not her sponsor, though most of the time it feels that way. And despite her getting mad at me, I still tried to talk to her. She cut me off and told me “it’s all good, have a good night”.

I was on the verge of a panic attack while she was texting me, and I still tried to mitigate the situation, like the idiot I am. This isn’t what sponsorship should be. She makes me feel guilty about not “doing more” for my recovery. I’m sorry that I can’t make seven meetings a week. I have a job (had a job? this whole COVID-19 thing is a terrifying mess) and I’m a full time graduate student. I have family members who are knocking on death’s door. I have a lot of shit in my life that I don’t want to deal with, but I have to deal with anyway. But I still talk to people in recovery, I still have NA commitments, I have regular meetings I go to every week, and I’m doing step work. But it’s not enough, according to her.

I’ve had enough. I’m done putting up with this shit. I may not deserve much, but I sure as hell deserve better than this. The amount of times I wanted to use because of this whole situation is fucking ridiculous. I should have cut the cord as soon as I realized it wasn’t working. And she wonders why none of her other sponsees have stayed. I’m sorry for the long post, and I’m sorry for ranting, but I have been simmering in my anger for too long. I can’t share about this at meetings because she’s always there. I am so fucking upset and I don’t know how I’m even going to go about ending this. And she just texted me saying that I should have done something to fix her technical difficulties tonight. Fuck man. I don’t know what to do.

ETA: She also has some issues with her physical health. It causes her pain, so she takes pain medication. I didn’t know until I had asked her to be my sponsor. I now I know that she’s prescribed some powerful opiates and benzos, which she takes multiple times per day. So when she falls asleep in a meeting, I know why and goddamn can it be triggering. I don’t know if that matters, but it’s also a major factor that has caused my uneasy feeling about this sponsorship. Fuck me. Why did I put myself in this situation?",8

I found a really great suboxone program, they require NA or AA meetings, which is fine with me, that's probably a really good idea. They also work on addressing the root causes of addiction rather than simply treating the addiction itself. Also incredible and exactly what I'm looking for. The only problem is that it requires *complete abstinence* from everything besides nicotine. The problem with that is that I use ADD medication (I have ADD) and I use CBD flower for my chronic insomnia I've had since I was a kid, and my CPTSD when it gets really... bad and traumatic. It's also just nice to unwind after a huge work load, it relaxes my body and mind but I don't get high at all. I've never had a problem with CBD or regular weed, or with my ADD medicine. I use both pretty damn sparingly. I use them purely as medicine, and give myself rules so I don't overuse them, because I know what I am like with opiates. The only drugs I've ever been addicted to are benzos and opiates (both for numbing emotional pain). 

I guess I just wanted to see someone else's opinion. Should I look for a program that is a little more lenient? I wouldn't mind going without these psychiatric drugs for a while because I've had many months where I just don't need them and don't feel any urges to use them like I do with opiates and benzos. But at the same time, when I'm having a hard time, they help me in a similar level as my antidepressant.

I understand the idea that being an addict means you just want to abuse the shit out of everything, but there genuinely are some things I have never had that urge for.

I so badly want off this awful fucking kratom train because it really is fucking up my life. I also don't want to give up what are basically creature comforts and a tool for studying more efficiently, especially when I just started working on a huge scientific meta analysis on depression. I understand wanting to use a sort of general rule for the lowest common denominator, but some people vary in what they have control over and I'm one of them.",3

Is anyone out there detoxing or planning on detoxing in the next few days? I’ve been trying for a long time but now have seemed to back myself into a corner in a pretty bad spot. I don’t think I would be able to use the next week or so even if I still wanted to. Everyone know the anxiety they face before the real sickness actually sets in. How sick am I going to be? Is it going to be different this time than any of the others? Are the few different meds I have going to work better than other cocktails I’ve took in the past? You know the normal shit we all go through when we know we are going to be looking at a detox. 

My question however now is.... anyone out there wiper super worried about a possible infection while going through detox. I mean idk about everyone else but when I’m dope sick I’m not leaving my room let alone my house. So the chances are very low. However it is still possible. So if found myself a few times already before using for the day sitting here with some symptoms and just absolutely freaking out because it’s going to not only be hard to tell if anything extra is going on through detox. But if it is I mean would you really know? Or would you chalk it up to detox symptoms. Also with a full blown opiate detox going on. If one does have the virus I would have to imagine your chances of not being able to fight
It off have to be 10 fold compared to others who aren’t dealing with any other outside issues and are healthy. Because everyone knows when your an addict and have been for a while. Your immune system is trash. You don’t have a proper diet at all. You typical are going to be way way malnourished. So idk. Was just wondering if others out there were thinking about this or if it was just me being overly worried like I’ve seem to grow that way about every god damn thing since I’ve been battling this opiate detox issue. I’m 33 years old. I’ve went through my entire life with little to no anxiety. This detox shit and being sick and trying to quit now for the last year and a half at least once or twice a week has caused the worse anxiety I’ve ever imagined having. Even when I first felt it the first few times I remember being like ahhh this is what pretty bad anxiety is like. Well it wasn’t to bad until I dealt with it for a year and a half. Now when it hits it literally stops my entire world and makes me have these thoughts and feelings that I just don’t know what to do with. Until I use of course then I’m ok. I’m 99% sure that it’s basically massive fear of getting sick and going through
Withdrawal for a week or 2 depend on your use
How often how much you were doing.  

That’s how my anxiousness continues to be I mean I really don’t think anything is going to change that until I just man the fuck up and go through it. Anyone with the same experience or similar that has gotten through or anything that maybe made things easier for them to get through feel free to let me know. Thanks ahead of time.

I know getting the motivation to exercise is tough sometimes especially if you are feeling depressed, but you know yourself the fight isn't easy. You have to try. I really had to force myself when I started (and it sucks sometimes while you are doing it) but once I did it afterwards it was instant relief. It gets way easier after a couple of days and then you start to enjoy it and look forward to your run.
Let me know if anyone else found peace through exercise and self improvement, instead of all the 12 steps and higher power stuff. Stay safe and thanks for reading! :)",15

What other way is there, that works?","Anyone who's been through NA or AA will know how essential the higher power part is, for turning recovery into long-term sobriety. Non-Christians often find a way to God (the individual Creator) via a different face, same substance, like faith in an unknowable omnipresence, a creative universal spirit, benign transcendent Gaia, etc.

So I'm asking anyone out there who's been through NA or AA - or gotten clean other ways - how do you deal with the God / higher power step?

My father is going through the steps (some version of NA/AA) but he talks about this divine higher power as if it's a problem. You know, like he can't get his brain around it. I don't know what to say to help give him what this concept is there to provide. Does anyone out there have a brilliant persuasive angle on the whole faith in a higher power thing?

He has relapsed before but maybe a sincere line of thinking that reconciles reality with the higher power will help make it stick this time around. That's what I'm hoping.

Any thoughts, any advice, any cosmic flash of insight, I'll be very grateful. Thanks for reading.",11

Is all progress lost?,"So I‘m trying to quit heroin for the millionth time. I went cold turkey with the help of pregabalin. I made it to exactly 60 hours before I couldn't take it anymore. So day 3, that’s pretty far I think. But today withdrawals got too bad. So I did heroin, but only a small amount. Just enough to handle the withdrawals. 

After this fuck up, will I start at zero in terms of withdrawals or does the progress I already made kinda count and the withdrawals will come back milder tomorrow? I heard people say that breaking up the withdrawal in the middle is a strategy that can work, but I am not to sure about that... But than again, I must have made some kind of progress by going 60 hours without any opiate, right?

I dont post very often so sorry in advance.

I am 7 days clean cold turkey and I just need to vent my mind.

A little background: I have been addicted to diacetylmorphine for About 2 years now, which started with my mother disappearing voluntary, because of her being heavely manic depressed/bipolar.

Since then I fucked up a lot.
-school was going to shit, so now I have a year off.
-Was fired from work.
-And obviously financial troubles because of the addiction. 

I have been to rehab 3 times now And was given suboxone afterwards, which I tried to taper, but giving me very long withdrawel on seizing.

I have been clean for nog longer than 3 months in a row, and this fucking life has been tough.I have been so consumed by this escaping of reality.

And now being taken in by people I met in rehab, giving me a home when my dad kicked me out. I just have to say, I am so Done with this way of life.

I decided enough is enough. But I was Scared shitless having to withdraw for 2 weeks.

This time was different since it wasnt the long suboxone withdrawel.

I am currently 7 days in. Slept good for the first time in this what feels like a way longer time. 

I Thank whoever is watching over me or has a good heart to me, giving me the strenth to endure what I havent been able for over a year.

I Also want to Thank everyones post, giving me perspective, appriciation And sympathy of emotions.

I am determined to conquer, no matter how Many times I have to do it all over again. Failure is part of the journey, And I keep failure close to me, as I do not want to have it overthrow my vision.

Have a good day, And to all: Nothing is impossible if you start believing in yourself, And set goals for yourself.",52

2020-03-23 19:14:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/fnu6y6/day_1_of_many/,Day 1 of many,"I've been taking opiates for around 8 years. Started when I was 17, took random pills from family and friend's medicine cupboards mainly tramadol and codeine. I also took many other drugs during that time such as ketamine, MDMA, cocaine, mephedrone, LSD and countless others but I always preferred the warm comfortable feeling of an opiate.

As I got older I managed to get a small monthly prescription for codeine due to a ""chronic"" issue, where I live codeine is available OTC and I had friends with genuine problems who were more than happy to give me whatever they had, tramadol, oramorph.

Eventually I weaned off of tramadol and oramorph, have been taking codeine every day for the last 4 years (besides some breaks for holidays to places where opiates are incredibly illegal and ending absolutely hating my entire trip because I've felt so ill). I have managed to stop cold turkey for these holidays but have always gone back to it.

My country is in lockdown, I have around 10 tablets left from my prescription and can't really buy anything over the counter with the lockdown. Fed up of driving round to pharmacies to buy more medication and hoping that they don't recognise me and fed up of being so dependant on something. I can't even calculate how much I was taking a day, way over the ceiling dose and it no longer has any effect on me other than making me not feel like shit. What's the point?

I took one tablet this morning, 30mg, which is probably less than a tenth of what I have taken most other days and I'm doing this. I don't have much to help me with this other than vitamins, paracetamol and ibuprofen but I'm going to do this. I've had chills and sweats all day as prior to this morning at 9am I hadn't taken any since 1pm the day before and I have a gnarly headache but this is nothing compared to the rest of my life free of this. I don't want to move on to something stronger and I physically cannot take any more codeine and I do not wish to move back on to tramadol or anything stronger.

I know this isn't anything compared to what some of you have gone through, are going through and hopefully will not have to go through again but I'm posting this to reaffirm my decision and for any tips or tricks people might have.",4

Hope everyone's doing well (& inside) and not outside licking doorknobs and coughing on old folks. Just thought i'd post about my short term recovery and how i feel on day 14 of my withdrawal. 

A bit about my background - I've been psychologically tied to opiates for about three years (used sparingly back then), and physically dependent for about a year. I've been snorting pressed 30's for the past 8 months, and in totality, i've spent 3 of the past 12 months sober. Went 28 days clean in november 2019 but relapsed. I don't think i was really ready to quit then.  

I've quit and relapsed probably 10 times over the past year and a half. Each successive time withdrawing feels exponentially worse. This attempt at stopping, however, feels different. Using did make everything interesting and allowed me to do well in my grad program as well as land a cool internship that i'm currently working at now, but the negatives so heavily outweigh the benefits. I'm tired of constantly thinking about using and i'm tired of being dull and lifeless. I won't pretend that everything was rosy and beautiful before i started my self destructive behavior, but i had more life to give back then. My girlfriend, my friends, and my family all deserve to have the real me back. 

My rough timeline:
• Day 1's are always pretty easy for me- a bit frustrating but not debilitating 
• Days 2-5 are horrific. Sweats, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, RLS, insomnia, anxiety, you name it. I've used benzos in the past to knock myself out for this part. It is highly effective, but i figured it was ultimately hindering my long term progress, so i decided to do this kick clean
• Day 6-9 i started improving very slowly, but i could feel some emotions and physicality/energy return. Started walking/jogging again daily. Still having RLS, weird bowel issues, and riding on about 3-4 hrs of sleep a night
• I had a blip of depressive tendency on day 10 and 11 and felt that life was hopeless. These two days were incredibly difficult to get over, but the thought of letting everyone down kept me from copping
• Day 12-14 i keep feeling better every day despite still struggling with sleep. Been getting about 4 hours each day. It's driving me nuts, but hopefully there'll be a light at the end of this tunnel. Physical symptoms have more or less dissipated. 

Three less common things i've learned: 
1. Adderall can help your energy levels in the day 2-5 window (if you have obligations that need tending to). It's not something i recommend for more than a day or two max because ultimately, it is another drug your system doesn't need 
2. Walking, cleaning your place, and running errands helped tremendously with cravings. It sucks to have to get out of bed, but the sooner you force yourself to get up and about, the sooner your brain will heal
3. Recovery is not linear. Every day will not necessarily be better than the last. Detox/withdrawal/recovery is a marathon and it's likely that a few days here and there will be seem terrible. But each week will see vast improvement and it's worth it just to see how each new week feels on the body

For those of you just getting clean, I'm going to be very real with you: in my experience, sobriety is going to suck. For a while. Especially if you had a long habit. I had been on and off opiates since the oxy epidemic, but on various drugs for more than half my life. Learning to deal with sobriety is *not fun.* 

That said, the real payoff for me hasn't really been my own happiness, but that of those around me. People like being around me more now, and my family isn't constantly worrying that I'm going to die. 

Here's what's gotten me through:

\-No MAT. I tried Suboxone for a year in the past and it just made me feel bad being stuck on a substance every day. I don't really believe it allows your brain chemistry to recover properly until you're actually off of it. **Note: this is what worked for me, not you. If suboxone keeps you from killing yourself shooting fentanyl, I support it 110%!!**

\-As close to 100% sobriety as possible, with a few caveats. First off: I find things like caffeine and nicotine to actually be harmful to the process. They're really both crutches and while I'm back on the coffee train right now, I find it to be a step back in how I feel every day. Second caveat: psychedelics. **Again, this is my personal experience**. I find microdosing psilocybin with the occasional macrodose helps me a lot. It gives me perspective on what I find important and just helps sort my head out. To be clear, however, I would never recommend anyone do any drug they've abused in the past. If you were someone who couldn't stop dropping acid every weekend, find a different way.

\-Daily meditation, yoga, workouts, cardio. Go to bed early, wake up early and do these things. I'm not saying to never make an exception, but I prioritize these things above anything else as much as possible. I'd rather sacrifice my social life than not do the things that keep me sober.

\-Detox and long term recovery program. I did a week detox and a 3 month program. I highly recommend it if you can. Just about everyone can - you have to put sobriety first though. Since you're essentially not good for anything when you're high, there's no ifs ands or buts about whether you can do it. That job is not an excuse. If there's an option for your kids short of foster care, they're not an excuse. 

\-NA/AA, etc - I did these for a while, when I was in my program. They were ok. I imagine some people would find them very helpful. **The most important part of their program: acknowledging a higher power, which is just a spiritual way of giving up control. Stop grasping. Stop clenching. Realize that regardless of what you do, your life is going in a direction that you may not be able to direct.** The only group that I would still attend is Refuge Recovery, when I can find a good group in my area.

\-Counseling. Find a good counselor you connect with that you can go to long term. I still go twice a month. He keeps me in check and makes sure I'm on the right track. I'm 100% honest with him.

I still get cravings. At least once a week, sometimes more. Sometimes they're intense, sometimes they're fleeting, sometimes they're nearly unbearable. They will pass. Life gets better every day. It's a sloooooow climb, but it will happen.

I did not sleep for 20 something days, with the exception of dropping my head for minutes at a time due to complete exhaustion.   I have talked to other dopers who have experienced similar episodes due to kicking methadone.  For me, it is the same for all opiate withdrawal with a week or two of sweats, kicking the sheets, throwing up, and diarrhea.  But the sleeplessness that comes with the kicking methadone will take you to the edge of insanity like nothing I have experienced.   ***Does anyone else have the same experience?***  It is so much easier to be clean and sober.  I have to remind myself daily that there is no such thing as a ""casual or recreational heroin user.  I would really like a shot to take the edge off, but ""1 shot"" is a lie.

The problem I've had each time I get clean is that I don't commit to or even ever join any sort of treatment/counseling/therapy group(s)/programs. It's never been because I don't want to. It's actually all that I've ever wanted; however, it's never really been financially viable for me and the MAT clinics here don't offer any sort of worthwhile programs and all of the typical programs around here just aren't well suited for me (or really anyone younger (i'm 25)). Luckily, I was accepted onto a grant program for MAT treatment at my local clinic. But I need to take this further and actually start with counseling or therapy or something to do it right this time because enough is enough and I just want to do what's right once and for all.

So, long story short, I was hoping that some people here might know of any sort of online programs, whether it's drug counseling/therapy specific, even just broad therapy/psychiatry, outpatient, etc... I've always wanted to find an online option for things like this, especially now with the whole mess that our country and the world is in with covid... So yeah, please share with me any and all suggestions, experiences, resources, etc. for any sort of online treatment programs, apps, etc. that you might know about. It would be incredibly helpful and I'll be immensely grateful!

My head feels like it's hot and I got the nasty Mudd butt. How bad has been your experience coming off methadone. 

I have gotten meds from the doctors. Honestly the only reason I was in methadone clinic was my doctor gave me naltrexone and I took it 5 days after doing methadone it was horrible. Both ends, ending up in the shower with Jean luc Picard and Jordi both coaching me to inhale the steam and hyperventilate so I could pass out and do it again.

I am about 22 days clean off my doc.. currently still going to my pharmacy daily for my daily witness doses! They aren’t doing extended takeaways or carries for anybody☹️but are taking the necessary hygienic precautions to be safe. Maybe because I was working in healthcare full time before, I am pretty much used to daily hygiene and sanitizing or washing my hands before and after most things I do anyways. But oh man, is the world changing quick everyday.. If anything.. I think now, more than ever, is the time we need to be supportive  and help one another-not turn against one another!

But yeah I suffered and struggled with my opiate addiction for almost a year before getting help in NA. Working towards getting into my rehab in Toronto now. My rehab center luckily is still taking admissions but have strict rules about no visitors and about cleanliness and respiratory hand hygiene care for all residents and staff and taken numerous precautions to keep everyone safe and prevent any transmission into the facility. They’ve even substituted their preplanned outings for the residents with virtual reality exposure therapy and group therapy is in the biggest gymnasium possible with chairs all spread out etc. So I’m very impressed! 

Problem is that even though my out of province funds for the 7 weeks of rehab have been approved there, I still need to wait for the ministry of health of Toronto to finalise it all and then there is the issue, will I be allowed on the plane to fly there, from Vancouver BC, Canada.. anyhow all my upcoming doctor visits have been put on hold for now, my treatment at my rehab, a lot of meetings have been stopped, and other appointments for therapy including my physio and acupuncture and cupping (to help with my quite painful and daily aches and pains I get as a side effect from my methadone-I may be a rapid metaboliser!) have all temporarily shut down and yeah I know, not the end of the world but still sucks.. also many other things have been put on hold now for me but that’s my blurb for now. There’s others who are in less fortunate circumstances and although I’d love to be able to help those individuals I can’t, so.. 

Trying to stay positive and grateful for the things I do have and the change I can make-by focusing on my mental health and calling and supporting friends in NA. Ultimately, am now taking time to cherish the little things-taking time to make all my meals homemade, journaling, working on my organization, making my speciality coffee with my nespresso machine and reading!

Seems more like six months since the days go by so slow. Most of the withdrawal symptoms are gone except for being lethargic some days an occasionally a little anxiety. But not taking any meds for comfort. Going to gym every day helped so much. Have had a few ‘I can take one pill for pain’ days but just remembered how I felt that first week and it went away. Had many mental days where you can’t stop thinking about things from the past. Those are basically gone. 
The biggest obstacle now is this lockdown for Coronavirus. Can’t go to gym, can’t watch sports (my best diversion through this ordeal), can go out to eat. It can get kind of depressing. But this will pass!
So many people have helped me through this first phase and I thank you. I really wondered if I’d be able to do it because my back condition (lumbar fusion, 3 disk replacements, stenosis) is so bad that the pain can really affect the quality of life. But after 50 days with no opiates I can say the pain is no different then when I was gobbling down pain pills. It’s still bad but manageable. The big difference is that my head is clear now. My thinking is so much better and I know it will continue to improve as the brain rehabilitates. 
If I can do this you can too! A 13-year run taking 4-5 Norco EVERY SINGLE DAY! Seriously never missed ONE day. Was just a way of life. When you get to the point when you know you need to quit it’s scary. No one wants to go through intense withdrawals, especially while working.
Take a week vacation or week off from work. Get the comfort meds in advance and go for it. It’s brutal but knowing it’s temporary is the light at end of tunnel. My biggest fear was wondering if I’d ever feel good again without pain pills after taking them for so long. And I do! Actually even better and it’s only been 50 days. 
It’s hard for people (family, friends etc) who haven’t gone thru this to really understand what it’s like. You can tell them and they can see the suffering through withdrawals, but they just don’t get the full scope of whats going on. So you got to find it within yourself and lean on people who have been through the mental and physical WD’s.",17

I find it ironic how the nation dealt with, heck allowed, the opioid crises to unfold. How greedy we are as a nation when it comes to consumables even toilet paper. We have no internal care for everyday citizens of America any longer, not that I have ever truly experienced it before.

The machine that was my scholarly upbringing was streamlined to create direct servants of the state. New doctors, lawyers, nurses and scientists to help solve all the world's problems. We were meant to compete against each other with possessions so burdensome that one must spend the entirety of their life at work.

Then came the insurance policy to recoup funds, dim minds, and punish those that weren't doing their capitalistic duty to the fullest. The pharmaceutical companies that were truly languishing needed a guaranteed sell and the overpaid doctors needed something to keep patients in the offices. Opioids and anti-depressants were born of this situation.

How could a nation be truly happy when the entire family unit was disbanded? Men were told they needed to work their entire lives for a home and truck. Women were told the weren't needed in the household and needed to enter the workforce and quit caring for their children. Children were being bred up for the sole purpose of serving a broken state.

This opioid crises in comparison to this virus engulfs the death toll. Just take a look at this chart of America's opioid deaths  [https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) . The people in power flirted with the idea of a middle class and then looked for a complete and sweeping way to gut it when they realized it was unsustainable. Their favorite choice of drugs impeded hormone production and the natural urge to reproduce, many different types fit the bill, including opioids.

Now that the market is all tumbling down, although it wasn't a strong one to begin with due to China's extreme power over manufacturing and debt, they are trying to bait us back in with zero interest debt and free money. I feel like I'm at a fucking circus.

They didn't care when they extended you that line of credit for that car/house/credit card that you would fail to pay. They didn't care when they knew you couldn't make the payments. They most certainly didn't care when China was flooding our streets with deadly fentanyl killing our peers, thought of as a casualty of trade. They don't care now.",5

It really helped. I value this forum so much. How beautiful is it that this rare demographic of people suffering a particular problem can all get together to encourage each other and share advice! Even once I get clean long term I intend to frequent here to offer anything I can if I feel I could be of service :)  


ANYWAY. Thank you everyone who wrote back to my last post. Legends! I found great encouragement and advice and it means the world to me. It's made me convinced that this is a forum that is very beneficial to us all. <3  


Got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is I picked up on day 6. Good news is for the first time in my life(which is kind of weird I haven't before) I dropped the spoon and the liquid became unattainable. I ended up having only 10mg of morph. Which is obviously nothing and I didn't even notice it. At first I was devastated. but now I feel like it's the biggest stroke of luck I've had in a long time! I highly doubt that miniscule amount will noticeably affect my withdrawal for I didn't stop withdrawing for a second. My weakness and stupidity was saved by a most fortuitous occurrence.   


 Then, to further increase my chances of success, a friend came and gave me a very decent amount of benzos to help me through the rest of withdrawal.  


Despite loving humans and all other beings, For a long time now I am often focusing on how much negativity we bring into this world. Maybe that's because I'm a semi-depressed addict who is focused on his own problems, but after reading/writing on this forum for the past few days and my friend helping me out of the blue it's a true pleasure to return to noticing the beauty of humanity.  


I've got a long way to go. I know that. But I'm not craving anymore. And I'm so glad I failed to lapse!!!!  
A few of you wonderful folk literally stopped me from lapsing the past few days. That's just so fucking amazing and beautiful. I cannot wait to return to the position to do the same for someone else.  


I'm rambling. I've had a lot of benzos. The intention behind this post is basically to express my gratitude and just share the story of my lucky slip of the spoon. Obviously at the time I was like ""FUUUUCK!"" but after a minute or two I just smiled and felt so lucky.  


I hope you're all feeling well and if not I hope you are sticking through the hard shit. I know you know it, we all do, but it passes. Everything does. Good times and bad. Impermanence is one of the only objective truths about reality as far as this eccentric man can garner.  


Thanks again for the beautiful welcome into this community. Without it I'd likely not have developed a positive enough view of it to continue. But am so glad I have!!!  


My one question - Do you think that extremely miniscule amount of morph (roughly 10mg IV when I'm used to either decent doses of smack or 180mg morph) after 6 days clean will have a noticeable effect on my withdrawal or do you think I'll get off scott free? I'm thinking I'll be fine but just curious what you guys think?

And it’s always spread out, so I don’t have much of a physical withdrawal besides some insomnia, restless legs, and headaches. 

But the mental withdrawals and the cravings are insane! I don’t have any suboxone left because I stupidly stopped seeing my psych when I relapsed because my brain just pushed the idea into my brain “well, you relapsed so there’s no going back now”

Well, I’m in the middle of looking at some more rehabs (I can’t imagine how embarrassing it would be to show up to the same rehab for a third time, all times within 3 months of each other. And I’m not sure if they’d take me back if they kicked me out of their IOP program for a dumb decision I made) and I can’t seem to gain the nerve to call my psych or the one who helped me while inpatient.

Went back upstate to school and moved up to 15's , 20's , etc. It wasn't until I graduated college and started making real money that the problem became clear. To make things worse I started dating this amazing girl and got her on them about year ago. For the last 14 months I've been spending $10k/mo on these fucking pills. At first I wanted to quit because of the money, but it has gone far beyond that.

Finally took a stand last Monday and have been doing around 4mg of subs/day since then. Most of the severe withdrawals have passed but I still find myself extremely unmotivated, fatigued, can't sleep, etc. I'm in sales so my whole job is calling people all day and I can't seem to pick up the phone. I want to make sure I don't become dependent on the subs now, so I'm not sure if I should continue taking them even though I feel like shit. Had some people tell me the withdrawals from subs aren't bad and others who say they're worse than opiates.

Really appreciate everything you guys are doing in this group. I just wanted to hear from others who have been through this and can give another perspective on when it will finally end.",13

We have 3 amazing kids and a beautiful grandbaby for him to live for. Our 3 kids are teenagers and are terrified of losing their dad..and I keep telling them to pray.  My hubby decided to get clean after long time on his own.  Some days are GREAT then we have the days where he is verbally downright cruel. I've never been addicted to drugs so I have no clue what he is going thru...only what I read on here and the internet. I know when his mental state gets bad and he says he hates us and it's our fault he did drugs and this is what we asked for since wanting him sober..I know in my heart this isn't the real him..he wouldn't say these horrible cruel things to us. I tried to get him to get sober in past but I learned til he wanted it wasnt going to happen and this time he said he was ready. I talk to the kids and tell them please try to understand that your dad is going thru a living hell right now but in the end it will be worth it. The last couple days have been back to being bad and he says he is going to go back to the drugs today no matter what. I'm so terrified and no idea what to say or do to try and help him cause when he is in this state it seems no matter how I try to help it sets him off even more. He is sleeping now while I'm writing this and I'm hoping the ""dope sick"" and craving he is having will pass when he gets up later.

In the meantime I have been told to just keep doing the same old thing.

Well last week I felt like complete shit from Monday until Thursday(re-up.) I wake up today and I'm barley feeling anything from withdrawal.

 The only big difference was I felt myself waking up multiple times in the night, which for some reason make me Les groggy. When I sleep less/less good or I stay up all night without sleeping because I am high as fuck....somehow I feel less groggy and whatnot in the mornings?

I usually take between 10mg and 30mg hydromorphone continue(Diluadid) each day. I always keep some 2mg pills as back-up as sometimes that's enough to knock me slightly out of withdrawal enough to not be a miserable pos to my very-pregnant wife.

So, any ideas why sometimes withdrawal kicks in earlier, harder, sometimes easier,less bad, slower? And any idea why such a low dose as 2mg can be enough to help get me through the day? I mean 2mg compared to 10-30mg seems so....small.",3

Seizure potential after three weeks?","Hey guys, thanks for all your previous support - I am at day 21 off fentanyl and doing wayyyyy better than a week ago when I was posting about how depressed I was and how I hated everything lol. Absolutely insane how much a few days of finally sleeping can do to improve mindset and help ameliorate withdrawal symptoms. 

Tldr; I abused benzos for the first ~two weeks to cope with opiate withdrawal, and used Gabapentin in tandem at doses avg'ing 900mg the entire last three weeks of withdrawal. I feel I don't need my GABA crutch to get thru withdrawals as I am finally feeling stable and consistently normal. Although it might not be fun, would cold turkey off Gabapentin at these time periods/doses potentially give me seizures? 

More detail: I have been feeling amazing, mostly because I am happy the physical opiate withdrawals are finally subsiding. Today (day 21) I took 600mg Gabapentin and felt fine all day, just a few of the same old chills - but nothing like it was a few weeks ago. 

At this point, can I just stop taking the Gabapentin completely? A lot of people online say they can't even get off 100mg of Gabapentin a day lol. Seems kinda silly to me given what I just went through. I want to just up and quit so I don't have to deal with more GABAergic withdrawals setting in from a longer period of use (at least more so than the three weeks I've set myself up for). I can mentally tough out being uncomfortable, but should I be worried about seizures? 

Also, please guys, don't tell me I can't do it and that I'll be too uncomfortable. It seems nearly everyone in previous posts like to make a point to tell me that I need to go to rehab and that I can't fight opiate withdrawal given my high pattern of abuse. I understand your guy's concern cause withdrawals suck, but still, here I am three weeks later clean off the fent with no intention or craving to use any opiate. I don't want suboxone/kratom/rehab/etc or to be told I can't do something when I have support here and at home, and a mentality to quit. None of this shit ever feels good or is easy. Even though I might complain because I am a baby, I am confident in my ability to get sober (granted I can do it safely). I am determined to be off these damn support meds so I can be off everything by the end of the month.

Would my best option be 600mg over next week, then 300mg for a week and then nada? I'm worried by doing this I'll be adding two more weeks of GABA inhibition, thus exacerbating the GABA withdrawals by extending the period I am on them. What sounds more ideal to me is quitting now and suffering more intensely over a shorter period. Gonna ask my doctor next week, but I don't want to wait that long if it means extending my GABA usage by 25% longer if I don't have to...what do you guys think? 

As always, I appreciate your guys concerns and help. Venting here and hearing others experiences has made this process a lot more pleasant for me. So thank you if you made it this far. I know I have a tendency to write too much.",7

I saw an article saying that many addicts are at an increased risk of complications arising after contracting COVID-19. I realize that a large part of this is because of homelessness, lack of hygiene, lack of health care, weakened immune systems, etc. 

But my question is, since one of the biggest dangers of COVID-19 is respiratory issues, and since Suboxone/Methadone and other opiate-based medications cause respiratory depression, does that mean that current Suboxone/Methadone patients are also at a higher risk than others?

I was 265 days clean when I went in for the procedure. They gave me a Valium to calm my nerves down, and it didn’t work too well but I survived. I was sitting in the chair when the doctor recommended a script for an antibiotic, as well as Tylenol-3.  I thought to myself “good, that shit is useless to me as an opioid...” I hate Tylenol 3, I always have. It was never enough, but I knew I needed it this time for real.  
  
I filled my prescription and immediately gave it to my girlfriend to dispense it appropriately to me. Which she did. After the first dose, about 8 hours after surgery, I felt it. I liked that I could feel it. You see, when I was just 35 days clean, I had to have my gall bladder out (I’ve been a mess since starting the whole sober train. Ailments left and right, including a kidney stone as well. It’s been a rough 8 months) and they gave me 3 rounds of fentanyl and it wouldn’t even touch the pain, thanks to my tolerance at the time. So the fact that I could feel the codeine told me I had come back down to baseline at least some. 
  
Except there was one small problem - it wasn’t enough.  I wanted more. The familiarity of it came back, the feelings I had before when I would get Vicodin or Percocet and it would send me to the streets running to heroin as fast as I could get it, just to get higher. Nothing was ever enough, I would spend thousands of dollars just to get a legit legal script only to turn to H anyways. There was no way she was going to give it to me, and I didn’t want to let her down, or break any trust, so sneaking and was out of the question. I knew I didn’t want either of those things again anymore. The fact that I gave them to her and made her dispense them was a safety measure in and of itself. For me and for her/us. She’s smart, she’s tracking this for me because I told her all my secrets and sneaky ways. So I took what I needed, and now she still has the rest, and they’ll be flushed or disposed of before I get back to her place. So essentially, I made it.  And I know better than to go hit the streets. 
  
267 days today. And still strong. Just be careful, and if you need them, have someone help you. I doubt I would’ve been responsible with them had I had to manage it on my own. But I did make it.",57

I've been browsing this subreddit for a long time but only just joined and am making this post because I am day 4 of admittedly only mild-moderate withdrawal but am so close to picking up.  


I want to nearly as much as I don't want to. I fear the former desire is going to outgrow the latter.  


Just managed to leave the porcelain prison to head to the bottleshop and bought a few strong cans to hopefully take the edge off. I also fear that despite the edge being taken off, it will also reduce my inhibitions to a point that I'll fuck up!  


Fear seems to be the predominant force in my mind presently. I suppose that's the human condition's predominant force.  


I've been struggling with addiction for the majority of my life. A few years back I was nearly two years clean of everything and my life was proper juicy. Alas, I lapsed and here I am. I'm 29 and living with my mother again. Constantly switching between off my face or withdrawal. I reflected on how I got clean last time; a mixture of being fed up with the pain, some skillful psychedelic use, rehab, hope and determination.  
I've obviously tried all those things these past few years but unfortunately to no avail.  


I suppose the intention behind this post is to both vent and also to hopefully receive some encouragement or at least something that will help me ensure that I don't want to use more than I do!

We agreed I would do my ‘conversion’ (stop taking oxy and wait 24 hours to start suboxone) last Friday; I took the day off at work and mentally tried to prepare. once I did the ‘conversion’ I was eligible to start group therapy. Well apparently his ‘system wasn’t working’ according to the patient coordinators I kept bugging, and he only sent in the scripts today. Clonidine, suboxone and zofran. Therefore, I missed the opportunity to feel like massive shit over the weekend and maybe, maybe be able to work tomorrow and pretend like none of this is happening. I was already super pissed about the whole situation and my supply is dwindling.        

So I get to CVS today at about 2:30 and they won’t let me have my prescriptions because the bitch pharmacist ‘went for lunch’ and they need to ‘consult’ before I start the meds. I have all the information sheets necessary for my ‘conversion’ from the detox clinic, I don’t need to talk to fucking CVS. This is humiliating enough. They wouldn’t even give me my thyroid meds that I’ve been taking for the past 6 years or my fucking ibuprofen. Nope. Go fuck yourself and come back later when we feel like giving them to you. I can’t come back later because my husband needs the car to go pick up some stupid bookshelves at ikea 40 miles away and the pharmacy will be closed by the time he gets back.     

I’m really trying, guys. Last night I had a mental breakdown and was just screaming my head off in my bedroom. I can’t stand the constant pain anymore. I tried upping the gabapentin and it doesn’t work. I probably need a much higher dose but I’m terrified of becoming dependent on that as well, apparently it’s a bitch to wean off of. I was thinking of going to get detoxed at the hospital until surprise surprise, bitch psychiatrist decided to do his job and send in the scripts today.

The songs i liked made me have tears of joy and be excited about recovery, since i already had involuntary headstart. Of course sometimes the emotional sensitivity meant having crying spells out of the pure hopelessness and the ""i can't anymore. kill me"" feeling.

But then the music again would trigger some deep emotional part of my brain, and i would never feel that good before, like when using, and not even before even starting any drugs.

I personally found that the really intensive schedule, while for some works really great and instills that sense of self through repetition, just did NOT suit my temperament. I could hear my body screaming at me to slow down and just be still and heal along a more natural timeline.  
The only things I regret missing out on are the therapy sessions I had only just begun working in. The facility I went to did CPT/CBT along with Schema therapy, which I undoubtedly need. But, so far I have no regrets for deciding to take myself out of an environment that wasn't working for me.  
Has anyone else opted out of rehab and went on to have a successful recovery? I'll be doing a lot of the leg work myself now, so any tips on creating my own support system would be wonderful. Oh, and I'm not a fan of the 12-steps for personal/spiritual reasons. The one NA meeting I went to left me with a really uncomfortable feeling, so that may not work for me. It could've just been that one group though. I'm open to try another. I'm open to anything!

Staying high all day to make it through my work day, just to come hone and lay in bed all night. Sheesh wtf was I doing?!

It's a new day, and I'm optimistic about my new life! Once again, thank you for all the support and sorry if I haven't responded to you, I will try to get to everyone today between chores lol I love you all and have a great day!",58

Whether today is your first, or 10,000th day sober, you’re amazing, and you matter to this world.   
  
Today I am 265 days sober from opiates, cocaine, and alcohol addiction. To make it so this is not a novel, I will say I am still suffering from some relatively minor PAWS, including some physical side effects.  Some of which may be permanent. Most notably, sleep issues, and some weakness, coordination/balance issues.  
  
It’s pretty common knowledge that heroin, and other opiates can suppress the immune system. I for one can almost always count on a rash/hives, and a relatively severe cold sore outbreak both when I start using, and when I stop. These can go on for quite some time afterwards. My last outbreak was around the 6 month mark.  
  
I work in a large sales office. My company is required to allow me to work from home if my immune system is compromised, or otherwise leaves me vulnerable to COVID-19. So, I am here asking the community what your opinions are on that?  My work knows I had a substance abuse problem - they gave me 90 days off last year to get myself through rehab. They’re incredibly supportive. For that reason, I don’t want to take advantage of them, but I do want to protect myself in the event that I would be considered immunocompromised. Anyone have insight on that??

If you don't want to hear about it, I totally understand, here's your out. Take it.

I live very near to Richmond, Virginia. There are currently 30 presumptive positive cases in my state. We went into a state of emergency yesterday and quickly after that K-12 schools started closing for two weeks to start. Yesterday and today I made trips to get everything food-wise we may need, fresh stuff for at least a week and lots of cold/frozen foods and nonperishables. I made sure we had a normal amount of your normal on-hand cleaning supplies and soap. I'm not stocking up on toilet paper.

I have a middle-school-aged step kid who spends 50% of his time with us, the other half with his mom and step dad. He's with us this weekend. He's gonna be out of school for two weeks. He's so excited, and that's great, but I am worried that this isn't going to feel exciting fourteen days from now. His dad and I both have to keep going to work. His step dad works out of town and is currently gone for work, mom works from home. His mom suggested that because dad and I have to go to work, kiddo should stay with her where they can better practice social distancing. I totally get it. But that doesn't mean I won't miss that kid like crazy. 

It's all together been a REALLY stressful situation. Sure, maybe I'm being overly cautious. But you know what? I'd much rather play it safe and self-distance as much as possible and be okay, than end up getting sick - or being asymptomatic and getting someone else sick. Call me crazy. Regardless, I'm trying really hard to keep my anxiety in check. 

The last time I felt this intensely anxious for an extended period of time was my most recent relapse on heroin. It's fucking hard keeping deception up 24/7. I had to get money, pick up, get works, use, and keep the cycle going - and I had to hide it all from the people I live with and everybody else. It was work, lots of calculating and pre-planning and sneaking around. I hated it. It was awful. I don't ever want to do it again, and I try to remind myself of that anytime I get a thought about using being a possibility. 

With the real possibility of people in my community dying looming over my head, anxiety's never been higher besides my relapse. Which brings me to my point. I am *so fucking grateful* that I'm not using right now. That I don't have to hide using when I can't go anywhere but work and home. It makes life that much easier in this super crazy time. 

I just wanted to express that. Thanks for reading.",71

Not trying to offend anyone who's died/been sick/will get sick...but seems like this is an ironically good opportunity for anyone who has to stay home to get clean. I know I could never get clean while working. Plus staying home will help our potentially immunocompromised asses stay virus-free. I know forced recovery doesn't work, but seems better than jail.

I'm not sure how this will affect the street supply but I can't imagine it will help. Dealers might run out/I've heard in Italy they're forbidding people from going outside. Not trying to make anyone panic if they're gonna run out. But ive heard methadone clinics are staying open? For now? Maybe get to one if you're worried.

I heard a podcast today that taught me a lot about myself and about the opioid epidemic that is going on. I really wish i heard this 2 or 3 years ago.

When I tried total abstinence before I failed and went back to dope right away. This time I feel like allowing myself to drink occasionally and smoke pot will help me not look at recovery as so black and white. They say in AA how they can't believe that anyone would put down a half full beer and how they can't just have one. Well I have done both. Same thing with pot. When it comes to dope though I can definitely get carried away. My problem is how do I find support in groups like AA and NA while still partaking in certain substances just not heroin? Any body have a similar view point?

Relapsed summer 18 mostly due to losing a really good career out of the blue, so I just said fuck it and next time I was close to any opioid I did it. Anyway off to the races.. eventually after a few weeks I used 5/7 days out of the week or daily fentanyl heroin (snorting).  Struggling I was able to not fully stop but prob by spring 2019 was about to string together a week, relapse once get another week, repeat, sometimes twice a week, but not daily use. Fast forward to end of summer fall 2019, I’m finally getting 2 weeks, relapse, than 3 weeks, maybe a month once. Since near xmas, my use has slowly ramped up and now it’s at about once every 5-6 days split between fent and opioids... the last 30 days I’ve used 7 times. I’m at 6 days clean now.  Usually never any physical withdrawal symptoms. 

My big question is my social anxiety is at an all time high, like I have a good career where I am the youngest guy in a union shop with a lot of responsibility.  Nowadays especially the few days after using I can barely hold a convo with a coworker or supe or anyone I’ve known without my face turning beat red, starting to sweat, feeling just that dread of anxiety.  

I’m kinda asking for some reassurance, my confidence is super low currently due to this infrequent use and not being able to control anything really right now other than finances. 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of intermittent use, if it will have you constantly in a state of feeling low and anxious, basically permanent PAWS? I am aware that if I can stay sober it will probably diminish but I wanna hear some testimonies if so, possibly for some motivation.

Thanks guys.. much love",4

I made a similar post about this a month or so ago, but a lot of things have changed as I've slipped further down the opiate slope. To catch you all up, my girlfriend and I have been doing various opiates every day for the past five months or so. That includes dilaudid, oxy, xr morphines, even snorting some ""H"" once, and most recently; fent patches. Oh how those fuck you over. The fent patches were the last straw.

To put it simply, I'm over it. I can't do this anymore. I can't take the cold sweats when I wake up, I can't take the mood swings when I don't have my pills, and I definitely can't take the lying, manipulating, and stealing from my family members who just want the best for me.

I've been to 12 step, rehab, therapy, psychiatrists, I've even spent 13 months in a residential treatment center when I was 14 and yet I still set myself up to fail. I'm only 19 and I've done pretty much every drug you can think of. Almost my entire high school experience is covered in a xanax, meth haze. For a while, I was proud of this. I almost got pleasure out of telling people I've tried everything, but now I see this is not the case. 

Now I see that this makes me a loser. I had no friends in high school and up until now I blamed that on the world, the other kids, and the teachers. But now I see that there is no one to blame but myself. I chose drugs over people.

Anyways, sorry for the rant I just needed to get my feelings out. My question is: what are the best tips you can give for someone who wants to quit opiates? I'm planning on using both prescription and otc drugs to ease the symptoms. So far I'm stockpiling benzos, gabapentin, kratom, clonidine, and maybe some muscle relaxers. What other medications help?

Besides medication, what are some tips to help with the mental/emotional aspects of withdrawal? I have very little willpower and know that no matter how much medication I load up on, my thoughts will be my biggest demon. Any and all tips are appreciated. 

Thank you for reading my long ass post and sorry for any spelling mistakes as I took a xanax earlier.",8

CORONAVIRUS?!?!?!?!,"Went to the exchange today and they were checking everyone's temp with a forehead thermometer for coronavirus risk. This exchange serves lots of sex workers as well so obviously people coming into close contact at a higher risk, might not have healthcare, yada yada.

Anyway, my temp was 95.something, then I asked him to take it again because I was like, do I have the inverse coronavirus? The good beer virus (ha.)) ? And it was 96.0 .

Note: I recently did a quick methadone taper off a pretty bad (but tapered) H habit (this has worked for me in the past, but I have to warn anyone else considering it the PAWS hits immediately and the cravings are right there and your tolerance is down and you are at risk for OD if you relapse). Have extended it a little longer than I'd like. Did maybe 7 days, jumping off at 10mg. Felt fine then three days later BAD cravings and couldn't sleep. Took 20mg yesterday and then had the weird temp thing today. I wasn't feeling cold sweats or even cold and it was about 55 degrees out so I was stumped. Then I slowly started to feel shitty...ive been working out hardcore because that's the best thing that helps PAWS for me...but had my coat on the whole time I did 40 min of decently intense cardio. Was so cold. Plus I've been walking everywhere. Took 10mg of juice when I got home a few hrs ago and feel better but don't have a thermometer.

Of course my paranoid ass searched the internet and low body temp can be a sign of particularly bad sepsis. But I don't think I have any other signs of that???

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it the slight withdrawal from the extra days of my meth taper? I always thought acute withdrawal made you feel HOT, but with chills. Or is it just PAWS and the dreaded temperature deregulation already starting? Then of course I read Opiates themselves lower body temp so I'm just totally confused. Is it the tiny bit of methadone?

This time I'm looking into supplements and food to repair my dopamine system, btw. Tryptophan and all that. I'm already committed to the exercise and human connection. But my dumb ass ALSO read PAWS can last 18 months??? I'm sure that's with longer and stronger habits (mine was 5 yrs with like 4 months of good clean time in the middle?) which mine was. But I was lucky enough to support my habit which means i haven't had much of the dreaded kindling effect. I know I'm psyching myself out with the 18 months PAWS thing. I'm feeling alternately great and shitty. I just know last time I still felt bad at 4 months, but I realize now there was a big emotional component. I have more support now but am still terrified of the physical symptoms that really aren't talked about enough. Worst flu for 7 days? Try that plus months of a mild flu.

Sorry for the long post. I can't be the only one who gets chatty in recovery. Thanks to anyone who reads and/or responds to this. I have supportive (pothead - I'm jealous, it gives me major anxiety) friends who I'm just recently opening up to (they always knew, I think) but it helps to talk to people who've been there.",1

The latter part of the outpatient program has yet to begin since they've had a surge in people wanting to get clean.

 This is good because that means more people who are suffering are seeing help getting clean, but I cannot help but feel a bit bitter since it's causing me to need to wait "" four to six weeks"" before getting into the MAT ""go to the pharmacy at the same time each day ti get your dose"" program.

The thing I am struggling with the most has been the counseling aspect. The women doing this is very friendly and I feel comfortable with her since I have now and my first entry session with her and my second/first follow-up. We spoke about many things and she let me get things off my chest, but there is no actual program to follow she claims. She doesn't have a specific method of helping me explore why I started using drugs or anything else. She is just there to listen to me and give her feedback.

What I want to know is what I could do to get the most out of this counselling. Should I be trying to create my own structure to the counselling? Should I just wing-it and talk about whatever comes to mind during our sessions?

Basically I don't see how this counselling will benefit me in the long-run the way that it is setup at the moment. I want this counselling to be an effective part of this whole recovery thing...but I was expecting more of a structured program where this ""expert/counseller""would be guiding me on exploring things?

I apologize if I am not making alot of sense right now. I jsut want to get the most out of this counselling that has been offered to me, but I have never been good at structuring things myself or anything...in the last I have ALWAYS required the psychologist or whoever to guide me, ask me certain questions, basically like a school class. I have never been great at self-learning myself things I am interested in learning about and I NEED formal education wirna teacher, progeam to follow,etc.

Please help me succeed by getting the most out of this counselling while I wait and suffer through withdrawal on a weekly basis before getting the green light on the Suboxone treatment

2020-03-10 08:08:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/fgcsp4/day_5_on_suboxone_due_to_oxycodone_dependency/,Day 5 on suboxone due to oxycodone dependency: does it get better?,"Hi all: Last week I was diagnosed by my pain management doc with ""opioid misuse disorder"". I've had 2 back surgeries in the last 7 months and I was on some kind of opioid (mostly oxycodone) every day. I was lying to myself in the last month as to how I'd become dependent: super anxious about making sure I ""had enough"", signs of withdrawal if I didn't take it regularly (irritable, muscle aches, flu like symptoms), taking more than prescribed because the prescribed dose wasn't as strong anymore, and so forth.

The doctor put me on suboxone and so far I'm up to 12 mg daily. I was taking at max 50 mg of oxy per day. The first day of withdrawals really sucked. The suboxone has relieved some of my back pain but I know that's not why I'm taking it; the only time I ""crave"" the oxy is right after physical therapy when my back muscles are spasming so badly that I'm shuffle stepping down the street.

Current side effects: super sleepy but also having insomnia, feeling fuzzy headed in thinking. I'm also having muscle twitching all over but I read that's a side effect/withdrawal of oxycodone. Maybe I'm still having withdrawal? I talked to my doc yesterday and she encouraged me to split the suboxone to 4mg three times daily to decrease my sleepiness (I work full time). 

Does this get better? I don't want to spend months feeling this way. I can't take any other type of pain medication due to having had weight loss surgery (can't take ibuprofen because it can cause ulcers) so all I have is a muscle relaxer. It helps but I still have spasms so bad that I yell out loud when I get out of bed.

The pain docs are very nice and they have a great substance use program; I'm seeing their addiction specialist this week. I never thought I'd be in a place like this: I've never used illegal drugs, don't drink excessively...but addiction runs in my family so I was always at higher risk. Thanks for reading.",6

2020-03-10 02:25:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/fg9i99/relapse/,Relapse,"Tonight, after 9 grueling days clean, I relapsed. After a lot of thinking I decided that I do very much want to quit, I want to be rid of the handcuffs, I want to have a healthy and normal life. However, I think it’s important that quitting brings positive things into my life. 

 I am a college student at a very competitive large school and despite my addiction I am very much functioning and have maintained a good GPA my first 3 semesters of college and am on track to graduate next year (1 year early). I’ve decided to continue to use as minimally as possible for the remaining two months of the school year, beginning a taper again about a month from now, and then quitting again at the beginning of summer, potentially with actual medical help this time. I feel like if quitting now means that I perform poorly for the next month or two (which I believe it definitely would), causing my GPA to take a hit, I may very well end up in a worse position than before. School is really important to me and my future. I deeply worry that quitting now and the inevitable drop in my academic performance would make me regret quitting when I did, which I do not want and do not think would help me maintain future sobriety. 

I filter my buys through one of the closest people in my life who will be monitoring my use and only giving me small amounts at a time. I’ve run my plan through 3 people who are close to me in order to maintain accountability. I will also be telling my therapist about my plan. 

I want to be free, but I feel like I tried to quit when I did because it was spring break, it was convenient, and I had some time off to go through the toughest parts with really no idea how badly I would still be struggling even once the physical illness mostly subsided. 

Do I sound reasonable? Is this just my stupid junkie brain convincing me to use again? I will stick to this plan. I will make sure of it. I guess I am just wondering what anyone else thinks of this, especially those who have been successful with recovery. Please let me know your thoughts.

Finally, thank you to everyone who’s been commenting on my posts over the last few days. I am sorry that I have let you, and myself, down. I do feel shame and a fair degree of self-hatred but I am just trying to do what’s best for myself at this moment. 

Best of luck to everyone still out here fighting the good fight. You are all so strong and inspiring. I will be back. I hope to be like you in the future.",2

 So thanks doctor bitch, probably have addiction on my paperwork now. what should I do to find more support in my area.

 I go to AA but NEED more. I need something I feel like or I will go crazy. 

I was trying to get xanax or gabapentinor val or anything literally! (and no i didnt say any names of drugs to her) just something that works better than ibuprofen for extreme nerve pain from withdrawal.

oh and yeah I got back on dope that week after she told me that thinking fine, fuck you. I actually quit heroin as fucking difficult as it was and she is going to tell me, I can tell your fine. 

Like no shit I look okay because suboxone only! and I want to taper off it to not be on opiates my entire life. 

 I can see now that I deserve better but my god it is tough to even get help. Like so because the doctor wont give me a god damn benzo, 


I am so tempted to try benzos on the street but I KNOW thats how you get fentanyl and I don't want to die. But I did buy some and it wasn't fent, but each time I took one I think,

 ""Okay my anxiety is so bad I will take the risk of death to get the tiniest bit of relief from this. If I die, I die.""

I'm really fucking scared next time I won't be so lucky. Please anybody anything, I need advice for what is available in this f'd up system and what others that felt similar situations and what you did??

2020-03-09 12:41:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ffxi4d/i_really_underestimated_paws/,I really underestimated PAWs,"I just feel like rambling a little about this. I was doing a gram or more of fentanyl every day for years so as you can imagine, my initial withdrawal was hell on earth. The physical agony was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Terrible, terrible time. Anyway,

In rehab they talked to me about post acute withdrawal syndrome, and I didn’t think much of it or take it that seriously. I’ve had major depression since I was a young child, so the idea of being depressed was Whatever to me. Nothing I hadn’t already been dealing with my whole life. I was so certain that if I could manage to get through those first couple weeks of all the painful physical symptoms I would be golden. Surely the acute withdrawal had to be the worst part of the process. Surely. 

Well,

As I approached my two month milestone, PAWs got its claws (rhyme intended?) in me. I was so miserable and depressed...and like I said I’ve always been depressed, but holy shit this was different. I won’t even try to describe it because no words can do it justice. I don’t have the words to describe how absolutely hopeless and tired and sad I was. 

And I was still experiencing physical pain on top of it all. It wasn’t anywhere near the same as the pain I felt those first few weeks clean, but it was a beast in and of itself. It was like....death by a thousand cuts. Like being slowly burned to death over a fire. I was constantly sore and aching and lethargic. All day every day. It took great effort to do even basic tasks. That pain took a devastating toll on my mental health and was, quite literally, driving me insane. 

It finally got so bad that I was becoming suicidal. Like, not just vague ideation like I’ve had before, but actual vivid and detailed plans were forming in my head. I got  very scared I was going to hurt myself, and admitted myself to the hospital/psych ward. They started me on a new mood stabilizer and, thank the stars, things slowly started getting better after that. 

TLDR: I thought acute physical withdrawal was gonna be the worst part of recovery, experienced PAWs, and promptly ended up in a mental hospital for planning to kill myself. 

The good news is, this was months ago, and I’m doing SO much better now. But....yeah. Things certainly do get worse before they get better, huh?",11

I am currently involved in a relationship with a recovering addict, and I'm afraid he's using again. From what I understand he was a high functioning heroin addict (supposedly held a Wall Street job) and he has been clean for a few years, but had one or two relapses in there. I personally have no experience with the drug, and don't have much experience with it's addicts, so I want to make sure I'm not assuming things and over-reacting. I've tried googling lots of stuff, but it just gives me information on addiction, and not what signs I should be looking for. 

There's lots of things I've noticed over the year we've being together, but sadly I just recently started putting the pieces together... It's hard for him to hold down a job. He finds excuses to go out to his car a lot while he is spending time with me. He is very secretive with things, almost to the point where I don't even feel like I know him sometimes. He will disappear for a day sometimes, and says he left his phone at home, or some other excuse. Sometimes he is so manic with so much energy,  it almost looks like he's been doing coke.. his pupils will be small and he will be bouncing off the walls talking a million miles an hour, and other times he seems so tired and delirious I feel like he's drunk, and he will just sleep the entire day. Then there is the temper, lately his temper has been so off the walls, name calling, belittling me, and then telling me that he just wants to give a taste of my own medicine, that I'm asking for it, but begging me to unblock him,. I've seen a lot of sociopathic behavior, but lately I've just felt like it's been different. He never as any money, he doesn't work out anymore and he was so into fitness when we met, I feel like I can't connect with him at all. I don't think he's using heroin again, but I haven't exactly been looking for needle marks, I'm concerned he's manipulated my elderly neighbor into giving him pain pills. He is very charming,. 

I'm aware my relationship is over. After his last freakout I blocked him, and haven't responded to his 5 emails over the past few days telling me how horrible of a girlfriend I am since then, but I am more concerned with his well-being. if I should try and contact family and let them know I think there's a problem. We both live in San Diego, and all of his family is on the East Coast. He doesn't have many friends here as he just moved here a few months ago, and I'm afraid if he's using, his using will only increase if I continue to ignore him. I don't know where else to go or who else to ask..",1

2020-03-08 20:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ffluei/easy_way_to_detox/,Easy way to detox,"I'm not a doctor, but I was a heroin addict for a solid 30+ years. During that time I grew to hate my addiction beyond measure. I suffered a ton of partial detoxes, went off and on methadone (which always brings me to a very suicidal place).
I even tried URD, ultra rapid detox. I was acutely sick for 3 months after that. I don't know why. Suffice to say that like most things I'd tried it did more harm than good and wound up in another relapse.
I finally got my head ready to get off of all opiates. Yet my experience being that each time detox seemed to get harder and last longer. So I was immensely terrified. I started scouring the internet and stumbled across something that seemed laughable to me, but given all else had failed and kratom didn't work for me the way it does for some, I read the silly article on the silly seeming blog. It proclaimed a ""cure for opiate detox"" has been known for years, but the doctor who'd proclaimed that was basically made a mockery of.
I looked up that doctor, who's name escapes me now. Everything the website had said about him was a little buried on Google but I had easy luck with DDG. Only problem I had was he was giving his megadoses by IV, and though I'd shot dope for years, I had no idea how to replicate that at home.
So, I went back to the original website called calm support and looked a little closer at what it said, and in the comment section as well. Now, this site does offer a few of their own products and a coaching program by the guy who put it up
 His name is Matt Finch. And though he has videos all over youtube and offers so many different ways to detox from opiates, some of which I had tried already to no avail. Despite the myriad of literature and videos he'd put up, I could find not one review of him, his products or anything else, aside from testimonials he posted on his own site, and that increased my skepticism.
I was pretty broke at the time as are most end of the road junkies. So, I could definitely not afford his remedies or services.
Here's what I was able to do. I had a bottle of gabapentin (another tool he recommends, but only for the first few days. The worst ones). I had benzos that I take for epilepsy, but I have a tolerance, so they likely didn't do much to help. I had potassium, Benadryl and some NSAIDS. Basically, comfort meds that had done little to nothing to help in prior detox attempts.
With great skepticism, and very little cash I ordered ascorbic acid type vitamin C. As recommended by the website I began taking scheduled doses along with lower amounts of heroin for 3 days before stopping. I actually slept the first 2 days of ct. I still had a few grams in my kitchen the whole time. No need to touch it. Then I hit a hiccup. I hit what they call ""bowel tolerance"" and I wasn't going to take a large enough dose of Imodium to stop it, because I didn't want to drag out my detox.
So I broke down and did what I should have done from the start I ordered the more expensive type of vitamin C that has no bowel tolerance. It was a liquid form of liposomal vitamin c. I got the brand Matt recommended though I'm certain from other people's experience I turned on to the method, cheaper brands work just as well. During the 2 days of waiting on the new vitamin C I cut it out and detox reared its head full on. So I broke into my stash but did only like 2 points of very watery looking shots, but nothing like before. For only one day after getting my new vit c I loaded up on it while simultaneously doing my minuscule shots. I once again took about 1200mgs of gabapentin for 2 days in a row. Once again, no signs of detox whatsoever. I kept up with the mega doses of C for a few weeks. I likely could have stopped a bit sooner, but I was terrified of any detox. It was like a magic bullet for me. I never even experienced PAWS.  And definitely no relapses. The rest of my dope I never did.
Sry so long, but I hope my experience helps someone out there in dopesickland.",1

I see how much happier and stable things are. It’s no longer just about me... I love being in “control” of my life again!  It’s clearer and it’s just so clear. It’s possible, yes, it hurt... and I know I deserved every bit of struggle it’s been. I even relapsed a day or so... but in that cloud even... I realized how much I fucking hate opiates. Throwing away money and eloping into a dark cloud, it wasn’t even what I wanted anymore. The juice is worth the squeeze peeps!  Give yourself a chance!  It’s gonna hurt, but then it’s gonna be the best fucking thing you’ve done for yourself. And I can attest.... wife fought for years form me and our pursuit of a baby together... BTW- ***ITS GONNA BE A GIRL***. And thank you guys, lurking here has saved so much for me, and helped push me to realize... we’re together even alone, and it’s possible!!!

I honestly have no idea how much fent i'm dosing. Been using it for about 7 and a half months now. For the last month I've been trying my best to wean myself off it and I think i've got my tolerance way down. In fact, I took my usual dose last week and then threw up all night so I think that shows it's lower than it used to be. I'm able to take 120mg - 150mg of codeine to remove about 90% of my withdrawals. Does that mean my tolerance is low or high? 120mg of codeine doesn't seem like a lot.

The first several times I tried to cold turkey the first 2 days of withdrawals were horrible and I couldn't function at all, but now they're not too bad. It still sucks and the symptoms are still there but they're not as crippling and i can actually slightly enjoy watching stuff on youtube and netflix, but day 3 is when shit gets absurd and I'm absolutely crippled and all i can do is try to sleep. I'm guessing that's the 72 hour peak i've read about. They're beyond awful but I think I can manage them It's kind of fucked how quickly my withdrawals go from ""this sucks but it's not too bad"" to absolutely horrific. How long will the peak of the withdrawals last and is my tolerance low or high?",2

I was getting to be convinced that I was doomed to hurt for the rest of my life and the thought was so depressing. 

But today it dawned on me that I haven’t been hurting the last couple of weeks. So much so that I didn’t even realize, haha. I had nearly forgotten how nice it is to simply not think about your legs!

I'm 19F and have been into opiates/opioids/benzos for about 7 years now. My last run was IV meth/heroin (goofballs) multiple times a day for around 6 months. I caught a pretty bad needle fixation and I was shooting old cottons up to 12 times a day and would even shoot the leftover blood out of old rigs other people had used weeks before (wouldn't recommend) to try to get well. Then I got clean for a hot minute, then started using kratom, then PST, doing up to 4 pounds a day (it was a lot). 

Jump to September 2019 and I hop onto subs and have been on them since. I've got about 5 and a half months under me and have been doing really really well. I'm pretty happy, not depressed, and putting my life back together. Got on the right meds and am excited for the future.

Yet for some reason, the past few days I can't stop thinking about using. I'm not trying to numb anything, which is the usual reason I would get cravings. No, I'm doing great, yet I can't get it out of my head. It's like I miss the good feeling, and it's getting to the point where it's almost visceral and I've tried distracting myself. But it always comes back, or it sticks in the back of my head, creeping in the background.

I've never meant anything more than when I say this: I DON'T want to use. I *know* it would just lead to devastation. I can't go back to where I was. Never. Again. This is different from before. Before, I would get a craving and I was half-hearted with my attempts to get clean so there wasn't much resistance to fight it. But now, I *hate* having these cravings. I want nothing more than for them to go away. I've never had such strong cravings while being so incredibly opposed to them. It's really bewildering, especially since I'm not depressed. I heard after like 4-8 months, cravings come back. Maybe this is it for me? I just want the obsessive thoughts to stop.


I know that if they stay this strong, I'll crumble. If it doesn't end soon, I know I'll give in and mentally relapse. And then its all over. So I can't. I don't want to. I'm just so confused, why this is so hard, if I'm so against it? What do I do? What do you do? Is this normal? Has this happened to anyone else like this? How do I get through this?",1

I'm very familiar with opiates in general (heroin, fentanyl, etc.). My question is - can methadone put you in precipitated withdrawals like suboxone or subutex (I think no, but...)? I have taken those before (I've had almost every kind, really). You have to wait to take your first dose with those  two so you don't throw yourself into precipitated withdrawals. Does the same apply for methadone? I searched and browed for this question/an answer, but I found nothing. I understand agonists and receptors, also. Can someone help shed some light on this/tell me some experiences with methadone, please?

I also read about a taper method once. They said take your first methadone dose 12 hours after your last dope dose. Then, 24 hours your 2nd methadone dose. 24 (or was the third dose 48?) hours you take your last methadone dose. Supposedly this curbs all withdrawal effects, and by day 4 - you are past them. Now, I've heard and read so many different things. Some people swear by 2 week withdrawals. One guy said he got withdraws months later during his PAWS. I think he may have had the flu that time though. Anyway, what do you think about thar taper schedule? I am quitting a large daily fentanyl habit.",3

*  Day-One (three days prior to day of withdrawal): Drink six ounces diluted fruit juice (DFJ) containing 500-1000 mg of sodium ascorbate (SA) every two hours until bedtime. 
*  Day-Two: Drink DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg of SA every two hours until bedtime. 
* Day-Three: Drink DFJ with 5,000-7,500 mg SA every three hours until bedtime. Begin withdrawal at bedtime. If withdrawal symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 5000- 7500 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate.  
* Day-Four: DFJ with 2,500-5,000 mg SA every two hours until bedtime. If symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 2500-5000 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate. 
* Day-Five: DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg SA every two hours until bedtime. If symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate.

I'm 27 yo married with 2 kids
Had an okay childhood so I thought it was normal but now being an adult realize it wasn't. Parents always partied drinking/drugs but they were good parents as in we always had a home and things we needed. In high school I thought I was the cool kid because parents let me have parties and my house was the ""fun"" house. Then some bad shit happened to me got pregnant at 14 gave birth at 15. Parents helped me out graduated on time thought I was doing good. Thought I was the only ""normal"" one out of my family that graduated hs got licensed to do something I loved. 

Fast forward to today and I'm addicted to pills mostly pain pills like hydrocodone and percocet but I take adderall exos anything to not be sober. I'm so fucking disgusted with mysel. I don't know how I could be so naive to not realize what I was getting myself into. At first for a while I could take half of a 10mg loratab and feel so good now it's about 5 at one time. The other day I took about 7 percocets and  60 mg of adderall through out the day and puked when I got home to finally eat something and just cried because of the person I have become. I used to have decent things and take my kids to do fun things and have money saved. What hurts the most is I'm putting my drug habit before my family I have no problem spending $120 on pills to last a couple of days but I'm scraping up money for my kids book fair. I literally HATE myself. I try to talk to my husband but he doesn't know the extent of my habit and doesn't really understand he say well just stop. It's not that easy my job requires me to be around people and making them happy. At first taking these pills I thought they helped me make better tips because I was this happy nice talkative person. Now I have pills on my mind constantly on how I'm going to get them or who has any and I'm so fed up with this. I don't know how to function without I don't know if i should quit my job so I won't have the money for it or if that will make me more depressed and miserable. I have no one to talk to no support. I'm so scared. I have kratom but I don't know if I'm dosing right because i still have awful anxiety when I try to use it I want it to work for me so bad I read amazing stories on how it's a miracle I know they say not to expect to get high or anything like that I just want it to help me function at work to not feel like such a peice of shit. 

Sorry for the long post been wanting to post for a while on here. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm so exhausted from this shit. I feel like I don't love anything or anyone anymore and that kills me I'm terrified at feeling this way when I admit I've been choosing drugs over my family but my brain won't let me win sometimes I just want to fall asleep and not ever wake up.",4

The probation department adviser set me up for counseling to start next week after detoxing. But for the detox they gave me a couple options. 

Option 1: Go to a detox (dont have a free one in my area so I will have to pay and I can't afford)

Option 2: Go to methadone clinic ( I don't want to get hooked on methadone and the advisor knows this so I told them I would only go for a few days.)

Option 3: Go to suboxone clinic ( I don't want to get hooked on suboxone the advisor knows this as well so I would only take suboxone for a few days.)

So between option 2 & 3 which is the best route to take for only a couple days? 
I know with methadone clinic starts off at small doses but might help me quit methadone after 4 days. 
I know with suboxone clinic I have a very good chance of getting PWDs. 

P.S. I have 7 Xanex bars to help me with WDs too.

Plz nd thx..,"Long story short.. I've used oxy (10/15/30mg) w.e I could find the past 5 years. Tried getting off handful of times by myself with subs.. but always ended relapsing like a dumbass..
Near the end of 5 year of bullshitting and wasting precious time/life... I ended switching to H.. or what I thought was H.. due to financial reasons.. 
After using that got about 3month, I had finally broke down and got help. 
Another long story short. My first rehab visit was good and bad.. the withdrawal I've exp was not the same as oxy.. vomiting, feeling dehydrated constantly.. and even getting sent to the hospital from the rehab cause I was supposedly hallucinating. just overall bad experience (borderline medical malpractice type experience too) 
Anyways. After 15/16 days in of rehab (4days In hospital then back to rehab for 2 more days) till I said fuk it and got out against facility advise..
After coming home and trying to stay clean.. by this time I had no huge physical withdrawal.. just  minor discomfort and brain feeling lost and confused all the time.. I just felt too uncomfortable and scared I would never feel the same, after a week back home.. I relapsed... I've made many bad life choices.. clearly.. but never have I regretted a bad decision as I have now for relapsing after a rehab visit.. 
Anyways.. I'm deadly afraid of the withdrawals that I went thru at rehab and know I'm going to have to face it again.. no longer have insurance.. so no option for rehab.. 
My hypothetical question:
if.. a big if.. I were able to get some oxy.. and switched to using oxy to get off H, most likely fent and other crap mixtures. Would that work? And if that did work out and manage to stay off H/fent/street cap bullshits for a good week or 2.. I'm assuming my withdrawals would be much less severe? (Withdrawal from oxy compared to H/fent)
In my experience, I've never puked stomach acid (yellow vile) crap from getting off oxy.. I've only experienced that from my rehab visit coming off fent/mdma/benzos (the stuff I was getting had those 3 mixtures) which made my withdrawal at rehab that much worse.. 
I NEED ADVICE.. any support i could get... I'd really really truly appreciate it..
I would also like to ask other questions/explain more in detail of my exp thru phone to gain the most accurate advice. 
If anyone was willing to hear me out and offer some advice by conversation thru phone call (I dont check reddit often, and find talking on the phone is much easier and quicker to explain than having to text/chat/mail back and forth) I'd be very grateful.. please feel free to PM me.. any and all advice and words of wisdom would be much appreciated.
Thank you..",1

I would be just now falling asleep from a night of celebration and congratulations to a year clean and sober, but instead I lie here shaking like a fish out of water, unable to keep my body at a stable temperature, unable to hold still for 30 seconds, unable to sleep except right after vomiting, just to wake up with every inch on my body hurting to limp to the bathroom and do it all again. Grown men are not supposed to shit themselves for any reason and yet I do it everytime I vomit. Don't have the energy to bathe so I lay in the shower as the water does the work I cannot. Did this happen overnight? Absolutely not. It all started as a troubled and naive 16 year old fresh into high school, smoked weed a few times and was absolutely in love with it, why? I'm a bi polar schizophrenk and for me the pot did what the meds couldn't quite do. No, due to my parents intellect they never allowed the doctors to provide me anything highly addictive, but I find xanax on my own. I was introduced to the little pill of pain at 16 years old in the lunch room of my high school, a boy had stolen his mothers prescription after his older brother hyped up the drug. For me, it lived up to all the hype. A drug to wipe my anxiety and not give a fuck who you are or what j think you're thinking? Sign me up for good. That was the beginning. After 2 years of heavy addiction starting at 17 I cannot remember a single moment of my junior or senior year of high school. I then had my wisdom teeth surgery and was introduced to opiates which was even more of a BINGO moment for me, the euphoria and energy I would receive in the beginning was a feeling of complete nirvana. I began with perc 30s and eventually progressed to fentanyl after dealing dog food for quite some time. Introduced as a money maker I fell in love ASAP and ran with it....until I found myself at 21 living under a bridge with nothing to my name but the clothes I had on and a half gram of fentanyl, at that moment I did all.i had left and went to rehab. On the 28th of February I should've celebrated 1 year clean, instead, I relapsed on valentines day of 2020 and I now sit here March 3rd after a heart attack yesterday morning from not taking any other medications of mine after being on them for 10 years besides 330mg of oxycodone. I am now back at home and seeking detox and treatment and believe I have found a bed come Thursday. I had been on suboxone and decided to get off it early and even after suffering through those excruciating withdrawals the opiates sang to me like the sirens in Greek mythology and I couldnt turn away
 I do not know why I am posting this maybe I just needed to talk to myself or what but my mind is a jumbled mess so I will not be proof reading any of this I just need whoever is going through the same thing that as long as your heart is beating the fight ain't over yet",57

I have been taking 1 Tylenol #3 for about 5 months a couple of times a week at night and it used to work great for pain. It stopped working for my pain so my doc moved me up to 2 hydrocodone 5mg a day saying it's okay to use up to 3 a day if the pain is bad but only a max of 60 pills a month before my back surgery. I have been taking about 2 hydros a day a couple times a week but I'm worried it's no longer gonna be enough and my doc is gonna leave me out to dry. Currently am on my 6th day as part of a self-imposed tolerance break (the last dose was 2.5mg hydro February 25th and the day before I took 1.5 5mg hydro). I have been taking Agmatine 1000mg twice a day to help reduce the tolerance for a couple of days now and plan to take it before my dosage when I start again. I was wondering how long yall think before my tolerance gets cut by about 50%. I also take Cymbalta, 3000mg Tylenol, 200mg Lyrica, 4mg Zanaflex 3 times daily, and sometimes lorazepam .5mg or Klonopin .5mg for pain/muscle spasms/anxiety. The pain has been so much and I don't think I can last longer than a week (I originally planned 3 days), but I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms except I'm in so much pain I just want to give in and take the hydro. I have access to 62 Tylenol #3 and like 50 tramadol's but I hate the side effects of those. Only thing is I don't want to do anything illegal or take anything else that may interact with my medications since I take so much.

Also, If anyone has advice I've been having this problem with hydros. I would get quite high on 10mg of hydro but still be in bad pain sometimes. Getting high makes me anxious so I didn't wanna take more any tips?

TLDR: Took 1 tylenol #3 3-4 times weekly for 5 months, then 2 Hydros 5mg daily for 2-3 months 4 times weekly. On day 6, is 1 week enough for a 50% tolerance reduction, or do I need more time? Also just started Agmatine for around 2 days to help counteract tolerance.",1

The Doctors,I was clean for 3 years until a couple of months I slipped up on these fentanyl pressed 30's. The worst thing to ever happen to the opiate world but that's about a 100+ page post for another day. Anyways about 2 weeks ago I tried to wait 36 hours then took half an 8mg strip I got from a buddy. Bam PWDs at there greatest. Right back on the pills until I felt normal again. So then I switch to some BTH for 10 days wait 12 hours snort a xanax bar sleep 24 hours straight and then take half an 8mg strip. Bam PWDs not as bad but still bad. So go back to shooting BTH. So I call my doctor who can prescribe methadone. My idea is to take 3-5 days of methadone slowly weaning down. Of course He disagrees... he wants me to take clonidine for 48 hours then give me a week worth of buprenorphine alone with out naloxone. Then wean me down the following week with suboxone. So 1 week buprenorphine and 1 week suboxone. I want anyone opinion on my doctors idea? I still think my methadone and clonidine idea is better but I'm no doctor and I have been outta the game for 3 years. Thanks ahead of time for you help,1

**Abstract**

**This UG3/UH3 project will develop vaccines against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds as a strategy to reduce illicit opioid use and the incidence of fatal overdoses.**

**-Proposed activities will include lead vaccine selection and optimization, manufacturing of GMP vaccines, and IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies (...) As a complementary strategy to current medications, we will develop vaccines against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds to reduce their abuse liability and lethality.**

**-Our team has already developed vaccines against heroin and oxycodone that induce antibodies effective in reducing opioid distribution to the brain, opioid-induced behaviors, and opioid-induced respiratory depression.**

**-Vaccines effectively and selectively target the intended opioid but do not interfere with endogenous opioids nor with approved pharmacotherapies.**

**-Opioid vaccines offer a long-lasting, safe and cost-effective intervention complementary to medication assisted treatment (MAT).**

**-Vaccines may reduce overdoses in opioid users as well as protect those in professions (e.g., law enforcement, airport security, postal workers) at risk of accidental exposure to fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.**

**-Our team has identified a candidate fentanyl vaccine consisting of a fentanyl-based hapten (F0) conjugated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein, and adsorbed onto alum adjuvant.**

**-Immunization with F0-KLH reduces fentanyl distribution to the brain, and selectively reduces fentanyl-induced antinociception and respiratory depression in rats.**

**-We will further optimize the lead F0-KLH by testing alternative carrier proteins. In parallel we will develop other conjugate vaccines containing a new series of haptens (Fn) to target carfentanil, remifentanil, and other fentanyl analogs.**

**-Development will be staggered across UG3/UH3 phases, and we expect that the first lead F0-carrier conjugate vaccine will be ready for IND filing by the end of Year 3.**

*AIM1 focuses on optimization of vaccines containing the lead F0 and new Fn haptens conjugated to industry-standard carrier proteins, including two E. coli-expressed carriers obtained from our industry partner FinaBiosolutions. Leads are identified for efficacy in inducing antibodies that will reduce fentanyl (or fentanyl analog) distribution to the brain as well as reducing antinociception, respiratory depression and lethality in rats.
AIM1 also characterizes additional immunization regimens and vaccine efficacy in fentanyl self-administration rat models. As a contingency plan, AIM2 tests whether AIM1 leads containing F0 and Fn haptens can be co-administered in a multicomponent vaccine formulation to simultaneously target fentanyl and its analogs.
AIM3 focuses on manufacturing of GMP vaccines and evaluate their safety in GLP pre-clinical toxicology studies through CMO and CRO partners.
AIM3 will then file an IND for at least one vaccine formulation against fentanyl and/or its analogs.*",1

Well I've been clean about 2 months and I'm a full-time student and broke and just getting on my feet and she tells me she has to move in two months and I need to either move in with her or she's going to her friends across the country bc she can't afford rent here.  I'd need to leave all my support structure and move right around finals week.  My gut is telling me it's a bad move and to keep doing what's working for now but I feel I owe it to her to try otherwise I feel like I'm the dick here.  I love her but I'm not totally in love with her yet as we have alot of baggage to work through.  I was abused as a child though and list my virginity in a non consensual way and I've never been able to open up to anyone and build an intimiate relationship before I've always just slept around and left before I caught feelings.  I'm scared I'll never find someone again. I want to just disapear and use but instead I have to pretty much break up with her after the gym today. I'm going to a meeting with my sponsor tonight.

During the ride I had two realizations one about seat height the other about unclipping and clipping in the cleats. The seat height was no big deal to adjust so I raised it up which took the pressure out of my knees. I had been feeling cramped up and pain in my right knee and couldn't figure out why until it dawned on me that it needed adjusting. Secondly, but most importantly the cleats. I had been unclipping the hard-way which I learned by myself and thought was the right way turning the ankle outward instead of inward.

My cleat un-clipping was reactionary and even fear driven at times, and I noticed that I would ride with my heal turned outward putting strain on my tendons. When learning to ride last year I taught myself to ride like this after all the falls and tumbles. There was an easier way and that is to turn your heel inwards, not in a reactionary way out of fear instead in a proactive manner with skill.

Learning the proper use of my bicycle cleats and riding stance has made me a better rider, and it has brought awareness to other areas of my life. My opioid habit was reactionary, I had taught myself to cope with life with substances. I am learning and living a better life now with lots of cushion and smiles! I do however choose to remain vigilant for fear could bring up old habits. I know how to properly unclip, but if a runaway car crosses my path will it cause to regress on old habits. Eyes open, fully aware, feeling, these are the ways I choose to be.

Side-note

Reading another post brought to my attention that I too have quite the amount of pent up sexual emotions. I have remained clear of relationships while rebuilding my life and this spring I intend to start building those again. I want to be involved, a good provider, a father, but I have had to clear so much from my life to even try. This year I graduate parole, this year I pay off all remaining debt, this year I love again.",1

Tl;dr: bf relapsed on meth after 2y8m clean, but at least he admitted it within a few days and didn't use opiates.

Update: he overdosed on heroin 2 weeks ago the day of his dad's wake while I was on the way to meet him out of state for the funeral. Since then, he's used heroin and meth multiple times and we've thrown away ""the last"" of his works 3 times. I went through his phone early this morning because he's continually gone back on his commitments to go to a meeting and talk to his recovery friends. I found that he picked up again yesterday and solid evidence that he had sex with at least 1 dealer when he first relapsed, but it seems that there were more guys that he hooked up with besides that one.

I'm lost. I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do other than go to my therapy intake this week.

I want to support his recovery because I know what he's like when he's clean, but it doesn't seem like he wants that right now. I'm scared of what will happen if I kick him out...or if I even CAN kick him out. What are some of the best things a partner can do at this point?",1
