I’m coming off methadone (street methadone), which I used to get off of pressed blues. I have successfully tapered myself down to what I believe to be a few milligrams or less (not sure exactly). From there I started replacing a dose every here and there sometimes with 3ish grams of Kratom (this has only been happening these past two or three week). Today, I decided to just go without. I’ve been trying to get to this point for so long.

I don’t feel the full brunt of the withdrawal, but I’m just so lethargic, chills, sweats, ect. Fuck and the over horny-ness. It’s not even my mind, just my body. And it doesn’t go away no matter what. It is sooo uncomfortable. 

And again, nothing like how I experienced in the past going CT.

But fuck, it’s hard. I want to cave and take some Kratom, or dig out the methadone, I would be sooooo happy with a little blue pill. My partner knows I’m uncomfortable but he doesn’t get it. 

I started out this post to ask a question but I’ve forgotten it at this point. I just want to be better. I am grateful I don’t feel worse. But yea….",8
2022-02-27 12:49:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/t2tkvx/126_days/,126 days,I was addicted to blues for around 6 months and got up to about 5 to 10 pills a day. I never was into opiates before trying them besides a couple occasions of taking prescription hydros and oxy. I ended up overdosing and my gf saved my life and went to treatment that day. The rehab was ok but I chose to go on the Suboxone route which I’m still not sure was the best decision Bc I’ve struggled getting off of it and still can’t seem to kick it. I’ve also had a long battle with panic attacks and my doctors still haven’t been able to give me medication that works. On average I have 2 to 3 panic attacks a day so I do take Xanax pretty regularly. So I’m not completely sober per say but I promised myself I would do anything to stay off fent. Main reason being it’s too risky and I don’t want to die. I’m now 126 days fent free and so proud of myself I know I’m still technically using (benzos and weed) but honestly those are still the only things that can keep my anxiety in check. Would y’all still consider me in recovery or does using those substances make me not. I have been a casual drug user for years and I’ve never been addicted to anything besides opiates idk why but it was just so perfect to me. Never had an issue with any other substance and still don’t. Is it possible to only be an addict to opiates Bc I truly believe I am.,16

Also, occasional Lortab (hydrocodone) use, but only once or twice a week. Before that it was an occasional/manageable thing for both oxy and hydro. The daily use really crept up on me pretty quick and seemed like I went from once or twice a week to everyday for a few months in a blink of an eye. Although not so much w/ opioids, I have had addiction issues in the past. I’m a 50 M, married/kids and had leg pain, stomach issues, and anxiety before I started. The oxy really does seem to help with some of those things, although to be honest, I mainly took them for the high and extra energy to keep up. I need to quit. Too much money spent and I don’t like being so dependent on something. WD symptoms are kind of a double-edge sword. Not sure how much the leg pain, anxiety would be there anyways or if from withdrawals.

Suboxone scares me from the idea of possibly not being able to get pain meds if needed – I have a history of kidney stones, diverticulitis, still need two additional oral surgeries, etc.., but seems easier to get and would not require me to be at the clinic daily.

Methadone scares me from a being dependent on the clinic (wife has two, week long vacations scheduled already for this summer) and the tired effect I see some talk about. I took the oxys for energy. Also, mornings are definitely the worst time for me and not being able to dose right away when I wake scares me a bit too.

CT I am just changing jobs and can’t really take time off. I do have access to gabapentin and kratom and am considering trying an anti-depressant, Remeron (mirtazapine) which did help me get through some tough times in the past.

I guess I’m looking for suggestions. Would CT be best? Would Suboxone or Methadone help with some of the leg pain and anxiety and be worth it?",1

Context: Work injury tree lopping - smashed my left ring finger open fracture of bone. had to go surgery. In Aus Oxycodone is called Endone and on the packet it says (oxycodone mylan hydrochloride 5mg) not sure if this is similar to American one.

Situation: My 17yr old dumbass brain heard that these things give u a good high so i go to doc and get prescription saying my pain is very bad for finger. NOTE (he writes 10 TABS ONLY) on the prescription and i get the tabs from chemist and go home. NOTE (5mg tabs) Day1: 1 tab, Day 2: 2 tabs, day 3: 3 stabs, day 4: 2 tabs. I felt good not what i expected first time ever having these drugs in my system. I noticed my first time having them i dozed off on 1 tab and woke up in a semi dream state was weird asf, like vertigo minor brain fuck. it felt diff and cool so i wanted to find out more. Anyways i think im draggng this on... rn im on end of day 3 and the first day off was HELL, It all hit me at once, joints sore, headache, muscles ache like physical wole body ache, sweating like pig, so bad ive never felt this shit before. If i new this would happen i would run as far away from oxy's. i wanna know is this normal? why tf am i having this shit feelings for only taking them for 4 days. I legit had 8 tabs over those days and BTW HOLY SHITTTTT! First thing i noticed, massive constipation not funny at all would never wish upon anyone, then straining my bowels trying to push i couldnt do it for first day, i think after metamucil, like laxative tabs i ended up shitting all of it out about couple days later. Now i got violent extreme grim gruel diarrhoea. WTF why do docs prescribe this shit?

What i wanna know:

Is this normal for 17/M first time ever using opioid drugs?

Any tips im on day 3 its actually getting beter though especilly when i take paracetamol or panadol?

My journey with opiates began when I was 25 years old. I was prescribed 3-15mg of oxy a day for endometriosis. In retrospect, that is an insane amount to me to start an opiate naive person on, but at the time I had ZERO experience with them. I thought, hey my doctors wouldnt give me this if they didnt know what they were talking about. Fast forward 5 years- habit raised to ab 5 of those a day- 75mg habit…new doctor…cut me off cold turkey. Thankfully I knew a little old lady who had like 100 of those bad boys but would only take like half of those, and would sell some of them to me on the side. Im now 35 and I hate myself so much, I feel like total wasted potential. I work so fucking hard and ALL my money goes to this shit. It breaks my heart bc its such a secret I hide from everyone… except my husband who also has developed a habit on top of a benzo habit. We both are shells of our former selves. Im too embarrassed to come clean to my family, and I know they would want me to move back in with them for a while to help me but, and I KNOW this is so shallow to think this… I dont want to be another stereotype millennials who move back into their parents home. I just feel so fucking stuck and angry and depressed all the time. I feel like I have totally wasted the last 10 years and I hate myself for it. I do take kratom for the days I go without, and it can help with the physical aspects of WD… it doesnt help with the mental. I want SO badly to change, but im terrified of taking the steps to do that. And as much as I love my husband, I do not think we can get clean while living together. 

All in all, I just feel so completely broken while also dealing with a broken husband. Having nobody to talk to about this and holding it inside for years is quite literally killing my spirit. Im lost. 😔",38

But it eats every last dollar that I have. I have to lie about it constantly and that hurts my relationship with my family. I want to do something with my life but I will never advance my life if I keep using. These pressies have caused me to lose a job that I loved, drop out of school, and I need a new car but I can’t save money. But when I’m high, none of that matters, I’m just happy, alone in my room, doing nothing but snorting drugs and playing video games and watching random bullshit on streaming services.

I don’t want to stop, but I know I have to because I will die if I keep using. But if I stop using, I will feel so shitty that I would rather die. 

No amount of drugs is enough, it’s never enough, I could get 20 at once and they will be gone by the days end. I live life on a clock, knowing I have 8-10 hours before I start to get dope sick. All I think about is drugs, the only way I know how to be happy is by using drugs. I have almost no friends or hobbies, I just sit in my bedroom alone using drugs and work a fast food job that I hate, but it gets me drug money so that’s okay with me.

For some reason, I thought it was cool to take them so I continued taking them even though I wasn't addicted and didn't need them. Once I got to college, I was addicted and was buying a ton of pills a few times per week. 

Once the pills dried up, I moved on to darker things. It's been years and I spend close to $2500 a week on it now. While the money part of it hurts, I can sustain that part of it. It's more that I just don't want to do it anymore. I feel unhealthy, I can't travel outside of the country, I'm always worried about making sure I have enough so I don't run out, I'm always worried my connect is going to fall through, and now I'm stuck doing stuff that I don't even enjoy doing because everyone I used to get it from is locked up or dead. I hate feeling like this (while I might not have made it sound that bad, it is worse).

I've tried quitting before and it was brutal. I need something to get me through it. People have told me about Suboxone and methadone before, but if I'm going that route, I want to do it legally with an actual prescription. The only issue is that I work for my family's business and they pay my insurance. I doubt if they ever actually look at anything I use it for, but I don't want to risk using it if I don't have to. I do not want my family knowing anything about this.

Is there a way I can get a prescription without going through insurance? What is the best way to go about doing this? I'm sure doing it without insurance will still be cheaper than what I'm doing now.

At the same time, I know the chances of staying clean, and the negatives of getting clean with a spouse.

We plan to quit a week from today.

I mean, poppy has been around throughout history and used in many medicines. 

Far longer than opiate withdrawal was ever recognized. Hell, the medical community STILL doesn't understand it. I can only imagine how much worse it would've been for them!

As awful as withdrawals are, imagine how much worse it would have been without heat or A/C, food and drink... Just a clean wet washcloth. Toilet paper.

Add to all that the fleas and lice (depending on your social status) and the religious nuts who assumed ypu were possessed.

I don't know, I think about stuff like that. Especially when I am going through withdrawal... I get that hopeless depression and it takes me to places I never want to revisit. 

That's why I got clean.

But last week, I had full upper dental extractions and implants... I took pain meds as prescribed but even so, last night was rough.

So thankful I had that Kratom to get me through! I felt awful, but I woke up better. Still, the thoughts and emotions haunt me. 

I can only imagine that many probably threw themselves from the church tower - if they could make themselves climb up - to escape the misery they couldn't explain, couldn't treat, couldn't escape from, and didn't know if it would ever end...",23

I don't understand how people survive eating fast food, and such things, it's basically like picking food out of the garbage and paying for it, cause the service is fast.  I get how food can be an addiction, but it's also medicine.  Look into it if you keep trying and nothing works.  It could save your life.  Also the food there is good too, like gluten free and stuff, but drinking healthy juices that don't have a lot of sugar, getting good organic vegetables in your system, your tummy will love you, and your mind will start clearing up, and it's just so so so much easier to stay sober, eating healthy, organic does make a difference, I hate to say it I get that not everyone has the financial push to be going to ""upscale"" grocery stores.  But it's just honestly worth cutting other expenses, to fuel your body right.  also there's plenty of other organic grocery stores not just what I mentioned, doesn't have to be the WF, but just give it a try.

It's now over 18 hours since I took heroin and 15 hours since I took 200mg Lyrica.And I have zero withdrawal symptoms. I am absolutely smashed, I slept like a stone for 10 hours and my eyes keep falling shut since I am ""up"". Just smoked a cigarette and my knees got weak. Feeling kinda drunk, but most importantly: absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. I am gonna wait as long as possible before taking subs. This is definitely an awesome helper for the first day of sub, where the waiting time can always suck and even after you dose, still feel bad because sub lacks a sedating component. Just don't take too much Lyrica! I took 200mg and wish I took 150mg.

\+++UPDATE OVER+++

&#x200B;

Doing the switch from Heroin to Subutex tomorrow in order to do a quick taper. I've done this many times, so I don't need any advice about that. But I decided to take some Pregabalin/Lyrica in between to ease the waiting time before I can safely take sub. Lyrica has worked wonders for me in the past for heroin, so I want to see how long I can stretch out the waiting time without suffering. In other attempts, Lyrica would erase 100% of the symptoms. But that was back when I was rather new to this and ""only snorted"" about half a G per day. Today I'm an IV user, been on it for 4 months now (was clean 6 for 6 months last year) and consume anywhere from 0.5 to 2g per day. So I don't know if Lyrica will be just as effective this time. Anyway...

...the problem: It's a 300mg capsule and I want to do half now, other half another time. What's the smart way to do this? Sure, I can open and re-close the capsule to make a 150mg one˛; but what is the best way to consume the loose powder? Should I just put it on a spoon and chase it down with some water? Put it in cigarette-paper and swallow a little bag? Any advice is welcome.

And for those who care about my detox-routine:Last heroin dose at 6 PM. 150mg Pregabalin around 9 PM (to ensure a sound sleep w/o being woken up by withdrawal symptoms in the wee hours) and at 10 AM the next morning, I am clear to go on sub (16 hours never failed me, 100% no fent). Though I wanna see how well the Lyrica works and if I can wait longer, ideally till 6 PM. And after that it goes...Day 0: 1g Heroin, 150mg LyricaDay 1: 6mg SubDay 2: 4 mg SubDay 3: 4 mg SubDay 4: 2 mg SubDay 5: \*\*\~\*\*1.3 mg SubDay 6: \*\*\~\*\*0.7 mg SubDay 7-10: No more Opiates, but I may take 150mg Lyrica if needed in those days.",2

I'm up in Scotland and I've been on 8mg Espranor since July 21. I decided to start reducing myself last month as it's taking forever to get an appt with my support worker. I'm currently taking 2mg by splitting my dose into 4. Can't wait to get moved onto the 2mg wafers so that I can accurately judge the smaller amounts.

Anyway, anytime I've discussed reducing with my worker in the past, she keeps saying that anything below 4mg ""has no therapeutic value"". I'm assuming she's referring to the fact that lower doses don't completely cover the opiate receptors but I'm long past having any cravings and my life is completely stable now, with no illicit drug use and I have lots of recovery support too.

Since reducing to 2mg 13 days ago, I've been experiencing very mild withdrawals so I know for definite that my body is addicted to the Espranor and I will suffer if she tries to make me jump from 2mg. I know Espranor isn't interchangeable with other Bup medications but there must be a way to work out equivalent doses so that I can taper down and eventually jump off from a much smaller amount?
Can anyone tell me what happened when they got down to 2mg, please? Did you get switched over to a different form of bup that comes in smaller doses? Were you prescribed any comfort meds once you'd stopped? Also, if you did manage to successfully come off, how were your acute w/d and did you suffer from PAWS?

Any info at all would be great as my worker seems to think that because the lowest dose they make is 2mg that it should be a walk in the park to stop there when everything I've read says the complete opposite.

I'm addicted to benzos 6 years, heroin half a year. I've been tapering by my self with the heroin for months and it's going pretty well. Maybe 100mg a day.

Last week I went to like a parole psychiatrist, told him I used heroin and benzos. he is gonna put me on methadone for 6 months and then tapering down. I was like wtf and asked why I couldnt do it quicker. He responded with I can also choose to wait 3-5 months go to a detox center with a MAX stay of 2 weeks. I told him 6 year benzo addiction, combined with heroin, and NO weed (which helps me a lot) doesn't go away in 2 weeks, he disagreed. It seems like he has no idea what he is talking about, but at least he is making shit happen and also prescribing me valium on top. (Pretty much unheard of in The Netherlands). All other doctors were like : ""Oh yea sorry I can't prescribe drugs like that, not my responsibility, here's a detox clinic""

I've done research on methadone and suboxone, and suboxone seems to be way better for me. I dont wanna get high, I dont want to feel sick, I snort heroin, I feel no positive effects, ever.

I went to a detox clinic in 2020, just an intake interview, I didn;t want to be a patient there, they gave follow up phone calls, and a year later charge me with a euro 5000 bill.",2

[PAM](https://www.genome.jp/entry/1.14.17.3) has ascorbate and copper as co-factors.

With deficiencies of ascorbate PAM would be dysregulated which would dysregulates synthesis of POMC which would dysregulate synthesis of endorphins. Supplemental ascorbyl palmitate and copper from copper gluconate could re-regulate PAM resulting in increased synthesis of endorphins.

[Copper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29402466/) is transported as copper (II). Vitamin C could reduce copper (II) resulting in decreased transport of copper.

I was wondering if anyone tried this: Stop using fent. Once I start withdrawals I am going to get on Suboxone. Take Suboxone for about 3-4 days, or just until the fent is out of my system. Then immediately stop taking the Suboxone. Would that work or would I just be having withdrawals from the Suboxone then? I really just wanna be sober, no methadone, no subs, just clean.

He's alright. Definitely not getting a lot out of telehealth, very hard to meet someone like that and try to get to know them in an hour. Just staying positive. My options are very limited due to insurance, but I'm just giving it a good shot.

After work, I organized the mess under my sink for the first time in since I moved into this place. Holy shit do I have so many extras of..... everything. Someone please explain why I have so many bottles of Tums!? I could cure the acid reflux of all of you with the truck load I got piled up over here.

I listened to the advice that a few of you provided in my last post about how you guys would approach working out after basically a decade of sitting on your ass. I went to the gym! I have fibromyalgia and my back is twisted like a damn snake, so I spent a lot of time stretching. I got to about .45 miles before my left knee started to hurt while walking on the treadmil, so I decreased the incline. Made it a mile before my back was killing me. Listened to my body and went home. It isn't a lot, but it's something, ya know? It's entirely possible that the knee injury ended up shifting the weight distribution on my legs and causing my back to start hurting. Going to wait on body weight training and build up to that.

I really don't have the muscles to support my spine, so I'm looking into a physical therapy appointment to get trained on exercising for my specific situation. PT is so fucking expensive, but I have saved a lot since being in methadone treatment and being off it for about a month. Really just trying to help my body help me at this point.

I also scheduled a haircut for tomorrow! Time to chop the covid mop off.

Overall, I'm doing really well off the methadone. No cravings or anhedonia. I think I got a bit sick from going to the club over the weekend, but I'm feeling better now. On the up and up.",9

Please help!,"I began this journey in late November when I was laid off and very slowly tapered off dirty 30s (Fentanyl) which took until Mid-December. After I was totally off I used Kratom almost daily to help with physical withdrawal, Xanax for panic attacks  (.5mg, a couple of times a month - for interviews), gabapentin for anxiety, trazodone for insomnia, and weed. The Xanax, gabapentin, trazodone were all prescribed by a psychiatrist that I have used for years to treat ADHD with Vyvanse (30-40 mg) that I only used periodically during withdrawal - I wasn't sure if they made the withdrawal off Fentanyl worse and attributed to insomnia or if there were additional withdrawal symptoms from the Vyvanse if I didn't use it. 

Once totally off the Fentanyl (Dec 15), I relapsed on the 8th day buying 3 dirty 30's, then again after another 8 days clean. Finally, I made it 35 days but buckled and smoked 2 dirty 30's 5 days ago. I feel guilt, shame, hopelessness, and fear. I was given some prescription suboxone from a friend who had gotten off Fentanyl a year ago (he claimed they made him feel totally normal and he is now tapering off them with no trouble). I decided to try them and cut an 8mg/1mg strip into 4 (taking 2mg/.5 mg) and took one yesterday.  I felt like a different person, my energy was back, my cravings were gone and I was motivated to go surf (I live in Cali). 

I was very hesitant in using suboxone because I didn't want to get addicted to another substance, however, I want my life back. I have gone to 12 step groups (AA) and even have a sponsor who is hard core and doesn't believe in using anything. He thinks I need to go to rehab or an outpatient and live in a sober living (he owns one), but I also believe in modern medicine! I graduated college with honors, just started my career, and hit a bump when I was laid off.  I did not tell anyone about my use except my family who is supportive. My mom is an LMFT and addiction counselor who supports 12-step but also supports my choice to use harm reduction and get back to work. She has been very supportive, monitored my taper, and is aware of my relapse. 

I don't want my current psychiatrist to know of my Fentanyl issue (I pay out of pocket) because I am so embarrassed and I am not sure if she prescribes Suboxone or if there is certain accreditation to do that. I tried to sign up to bicycle health (an online Sub prescriber) but they want to contact my primary physician (don't have one) and my psychiatrist which I don't really want to do. 

I am not exactly sure how I go about getting suboxone without involving my psychiatrist - or if that is even a possibility. Ideally, I would like to try suboxone (totally monitored at home so it is not abused), for a short time (like 6 months) to get my life back on track then taper off. I think having a Xanax to take in case of a panic attack helps because it usually prevents the panic attack (as most of the panic comes from thinking I am having the panic attack) and the Vyvanse does help with my severe ADHD, when I need to focus. I plan on continuing therapy a couple of times a week, and doing meetings to fill empty time, but I feel like I will gain my self-confidence a lot quicker by getting back on track with my career and doing the activities I enjoy like surfing as opposed to going to rehab and everyone knowing (employers, college buddies, and my grandparents especially) about this nightmare. 

Does anyone have any advice? I appreciate any help.",2

So I just wanted to let everyone know that I’m now 10 days clean from a 3 month long 1x 30mg’s pressed a day habit (never sniffed/only orally taken). I am 100% aware that my habit is no where close or near as bad as most people on here, but I just needed to get this off my chest since I have no one to tell in real and if I did everyone would be shocked because I’ve been known to everyone as a leader, a great guy, a warrior type mentally, and one of the nicest people you will ever meet.

I’m 27 years old and I literally never have taken or abused substances up until about 3 months ago. Long story short a “friend” of mine posted a Snapchat of him with these blue 30’s called Percocets and I said fuck it I’ll try it…Biggest mistake of my life which lead me to a 3 month long binge of doing them. I had no desire to take them other than to cure my bored at night (pathetic I know). I’m in great shape, 27 years old, run a successful company that I started at 25, and decided 10 days ago “fuck this I’m done, this isn’t who I am”.

Now here’s when I knew I had a problem-
I ran out on Christmas Eve (didn’t think any of it- but boy was I fucking wrong the next day). I woke up on Christmas Day and I felt MISERABLE. I was shaking, anxiety throughout the roof, and felt like I was gonna die lol. I had no idea what was happening until that “friend” told me I was withdrawing and I immediately freaked the fuck the fuck out. I ended up buying about 30 more, woke up about 10 days ago, and legit just decided to CT this because I know where this will lead to if I keep going down this path. 

Again-

I know some may laugh at me considering this wasn’t that long of a thing, but to me I couldn’t believe how a little pill could be so fucking addicting and how much it would fuck with your mind and change you as a person.

I’ve been lurking every single day on here for the past 2 weeks reading all the stories and the tremendous amount of support from everyone on here which is what led me to writing on here. It’s day 10 and to be honest I feel fine. Been working out since day 4, meditating, took Kratom for the first 7 days (under 3-4grams per day), (also took an intense 3 day detox to get all this shit out of me) and now I’m feeling fine. The only thing that’s a bitch and a half is the mental part where you get that itch to pop a perc sometimes but I know that my brain needs time to heal. Anyways- Thanks for letting me get this off my chest and I promise I’ll never take that shit again. For anyone going through it, don’t ever give up. You’re mind is more powerful than you may think.",30

I don't even know where to start with working out. I've got a chronic pain condition, so even things like squats kill my knees. It affects my muscles, joints, and especially my tendons. Even carrying groceries causes my joints to lock up. I can't carry a bag of cat litter without triggering an asthma attack because of exertion. It's a mess.

Every time I've gone to the gym in the past, I go for a week and then my body completely gives out, I break the habit of going, and I'm basically hobbling around for a few days. Got asthma out the wazoo that's gotten a lot worse in the last few years. The chronic fatigue is really a killer too. Without paying a personal trainer, where would you even start with my situation?

The supplements I’m already planning on taking are; L Tyrosine, Vitamin C megadose in the first week or so or however long it takes to feel better, vitamin D, Vit K2, phenibut, hopefully only 2-3 times a week (I’ve had a daily habit with this before as well),  and I plan to microdose psilocybin every other day if I can get some more. Zinc 50mg every 3-4 days, magnesium glycinate, L theanine, and I’m thinking about adding niacin in there for that sweet niacin flush. Isn’t niacin good for opiate WD?

Let me know what you think about my stack and what I could add. It’s going to be hard but I have no choice but to cut this poison out of my life and stay relatively clean.

I will just be taking kratom, phenibut 2-3 times a week never back to back days, hopefully microdosing mushrooms for my mental health and all the benefits it brings, and smoking weed daily, and I also smoke dabs everyday I think I’m going to stop doing that. It’s what I use at work to get high but I will probably just bring a bowl to pack to smoke during the day and just save the dabs for the weekends. 

Can’t wait to get my life back.


Warning, NSFW language below. I had to vent. 


Hell I won’t be completely clean but atleast I won’t be on fentanyl every damn day of my life. They are trying to ruin my life. I hate being a slave to a drug. This drug really grabs you by the balls and makes you it’s bitch. Sorry for the language.",1

I've been on this sub for about 4 months now and can not understand how someone will say they have clean time but be smoking weed, doing Kratom or benzos or whatever other SUBSTANCE! then mislead new recovering addicts with ""3 days clean and I feel awesome"" posts 🤨 

I'm not judging per say do whatever the hell you want but lets not make new people in recovery have false hope !! That will make them quit within a week expecting life to be great with no drugs the first week which is hiiiighly unlikely for long term users, even short term with potent opiates. 

Please keep the term ""clean time"" out of your text or ""day so an so"" when your still getting HIGH, it is a slap in the face to us recovering with no medications or substances and dealing with our demons like were suppose to and coming out the other end, battle after battle, to a point of peace and happiness SOBER! DONT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE USING ANOTHER SUBSTANCE IS OK WHEN ITS FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT WANT TO COME TO TERMS OF SOBRIETY. it's ok..

Sobriety is breaking every chain that held you back and changing everything about you that caused you to use, not simply using a drug to feel better. Sobriety takes hard work and realizations that your better of no matter what free of substance abuse or I won't heal or just simply fall into another addiction, making my life miserable in some way because I can't function like a normal person without GETTING HIGH OFF SOMETHING, your still using and that's that. 

All that to say keep fighting the good fight and stop lying to yourself and peers, it will definitely hold you back. Man up and take responsibility and show you love some one with honesty and openess. I'm 9 months and can't believe I made it this far with no help from medications or SUBSTANCES , been brutal but I've finally got over a hump about 2 months ago which I wake up feeling great and happy throughout the day and now starting to look into ""new"" hobbies and a career down the line.  Not a good idea to be too optimistic right now but I am finally very hopeful and can say I'm FREEEEE!

After about 6 months, though, it feels somewhat similar to the opioid: The positive effect is hardly there anymore, and it's just this weird, unpleasant feeling.

So stop it? Slowly? Quite worried about depression during and after taper.

So I went into a very bad ODSMT addiction. I used for approximately 5 months in total every day. Last week saturday night, I took my last massive dose of 800mgs.

I was on 1200mgs of ODSMT a day at the very end.

So, I did it with the help of a clinic which said Suboxone would be the key for me. I waited 48 full hours since my last dose and started to take 14mg Subs on Monday. Then 16mgs on Tuesday. Wednesday also 16mgs. Then thursday I took 2mgs more because the anxiety became just too much in the evening (I take the Subs once a day sublingually) so I was on 18mgs and it became so much worse. Took 18mgs on Friday and felt like I had a fever. Then, today I only took 8mgs and I instantly felt better.

No more sweating, no more bad Anxiety, no more temperature disregulation, way less fatigue...

The clinic told me to stabilise on 16mgs for a week but I just feel so much better with just 8mgs once a day.

Do you guys advice to just do a quick taper? I had serious pain, but it became less and less everyday. Now, I'm one full week off the ODSMT.

Shall I take 4mgs tomorrow, and look how that goes?

Suboxone feels so dirty to me. The jump from 18 to just 8 felt like 10 times better. It really seems that less is more with Subs.

I don't really care about what my addiction doctor wants. She is a real bitch. She didn't even know what ODSMT was, I had to explain everything to her. She even calls me annoying and stubborn (and I do have a grade in medicin... I know what I'm talking about... But some doctors just always think they know it better...). When I call her for advices, I get instant Voicemail. She doesn't even call me back. It's just bad. To the point I want to make my own decisions. 

I want to get off Suboxone as soon as possible. The jump from 18mg to 8mg in just one day felt like a relieve. I instantly had 10 times more energy, I had a very relaxing day with my best friend. Sober life is so much better (yes, I feel no high whatsoever from the Subs, only side effects, I guess from the high doses...)

Is it better to stay on 8mgs a day (taken every morning) until I see her next week wednesday or just jumpship to 4mgs tomorrow, 2mgs the day after that and then just quit. I know it will be a bumpy ride, but I tried quitting cold turkey with the ODSMT two times and that didn't work at all so the Subs helped me a lot. Even with the subs last week (especially su, mo, thu, wed) were hell. But I'm really getting feeling better. 

I also got on Myrtazipine for my depression (10 days ago). It's a 5HT2c antagonist, just like ODSMT. I had to ask for it myself because I knew that the Subs would do nothing for the rebound depression the ODSMT gives because of the 5HT2c antagonism. The clinic didn't knew a thing about it until I asked for a psychiatrist that spoke my language and she knew exactly what I meant to say, and introduced the Myrtazipine asap (and I quit CT with Zoloft, 6 weeks, 50mg a day).

Please give me some advices! I know; the longer you stay on Subs, the longer it will take to get free from it. I hate the feeling on it, and a lower dose did feel much better!",1

Fast forward to maybe two months ago… I had a very low point, I was manipulative as fuck, hitting up my exes for money, and whoever else would give it to me really. I never did anything really super gnarly like I never had sex for drugs and I always made sure that my pets were fed and my bills were paid. But I hardly have any money besides that, I can see my friendships and relationships are definitely affected by this. My best friend thinks I’m sober, my boyfriend thinks I’m sober.

I’ve tried to quit maybe three times now and I can’t really go longer than about a week. I’m used to the physical withdrawal, it’s really not that bad. I mean yes, I get drenched in sweat, restless legs, and I overall feel like a real piece of shit. But that’s not the hardest part, once I’m sober I feel completely bored And anxious, and like I just can’t function without the stupid fucking 30s. I can’t afford to miss several days of work to go to an intake program, I’m thinking maybe I should go to na meetings? I really feel like I’m kind of running out of options here, and I’m really happy in my relationship, and I have the most wonderful best friend in the whole world And it would devastate both of them if they found out I’ve been lying.

Until March 15, 2019, every time I tried to quit heroin, I secretly looked forward to lowering my tolerance and being able to use *just once.*  I went to rehab in 2018 but I had two stamps in my hand not even an hour after coming home. The high felt different now, and I told myself I hated it, but I couldn't stop going back to it.  I overdosed a 4th time in January '19 and had to be put on a ventilator when my lungs filled with my own blood. I got high after that anyway. I was convinced I'd die a heroin addict, and I still don't give a fuck what anyone thinks about me.

The burn marks on my body from when I would nod out with a cigarette in my hand have healed, and the physical scars are no longer visible. I learned to code and landed a job at a large tech company for more money than I can reasonably spend. My friends no longer pity me and I've made so many new ones. I've met amazing women, I travel twice a month, and I fulfilled my lifelong dream of skydiving last month.

Still, sometimes, it feels like this is all an accident. I'm a heroin addict. I did this to myself and I shouldn't be here.

I’m a Marine Corp vet who took a piece of a mortar round to the lumbar, L2-S1.  Instant herniated disks and shattered vertebrae. Temporary paralysis. 
VA changed their pain med management from too much to too little. Found other few other vets such as myself. Was introduced to, and am using, IV H @ .8g a day. 

I have for Rx’s: 
Beat blocker (name escapes me)
Clonidine
Klonopin 
Gabapentin 
Baclofen 

Not asking for advice, just history. 
What helped you the most in getting through WD’s? How did it help? What dosage was that at? I have a plan for recovery. The entrance fee is being clean. 

WD’s for me is usually cold sweats. Massive sweating at night. Frequent bathroom visits. The worst has to be the crawling leg and shoulder muscles.  

Thank you",2

I am a 30 mother of 2 with an excellent job as a plant manager at a huge manufacturing plant. I have it all- 2 perfect kids, great husband, 2 houses, 3 cars and a boat. Who knew this would happen?? I lost a child at birth and that’s when my issues started. I was depressed and had to have an emergency vertical incision and c-section. Because these are so invasive, I was on morphine, then oxy for months. I enjoyed the energy they gave me, so I began “doctor shopping”. Since I was getting the pills prescribed I wasn’t an addict, right??? When I found myself snorting and smoking oxy that was laced with gent I was DONE!

Got my shit together, tapered off the oxy. Around this time zaza (tianeptine) hit the scene. It was sold as gas stations and legal. It had a short half life and gave this amazing burst of energy. I got up to 3, 4 sometimes 5 bottles a day. Typically my supplier sold me bottler for $12. By my calculations I spent over $50,000 of our savings on this. My husband noticed the money was dipped into and asked what it was for. I broke down and told him. He supported me! He helped me taper off. I quit Tia in March 2021. I could feel the urge for oxy begin to rise after a few months so I got a prescription for subs. 

I may be alone here, but 16 - 24mg of subs did help me not crace the drugs, but I also don’t feel like they gave me euphoria or anything. I was on those for a few months and decided I was ready once again yo be substance free. Last Saturday I took my 24 mg dose, got rid of the rest and haven’t looked back. I don’t recommend quitting CT, but it has been surprisingly easy for me! I have a massive headache one night, some GI issues and some insomnia but I’m now sleeping 6-8 hours a night. I’m so clearheaded and feel so good! 

If anyone needs support I’m here for you!",12
2022-02-19 12:45:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/swfitw/subutex_advice/,Subutex advice,"First time writing, anyways here goes, I had a nasty accident with a tractor some years ago, which in the end started me on my painkillers addiction journey. 

My highest daily oxy perscribed at one point was 180mg twice a day, with 100mg oxynom liquid for breakthrough pain, I did get down to 30mg in 16 months, unfortunately I found a nice chap who was selling these,and eventually restarted my addiction,and in 12 months i was spending £1500 a month buying strips of 14 of all different MG strengths. 

Anyways sorry for going on, I went to my local opioid addiction clinic, and they started me on Subutex,which now I take 16mg a day.

Don't get me wrong, I feel great, and free, and no wd worries,not to mention extra money,but without sounding selfish I do miss getting high,I really do, I have too codeine while on subs and got few itches but nothing special, I also had a full 300ml oramorph, which I had in a 24h period again whilst having subs in my system, it helped me sleep but nothing else. I was scared incase I had pre WD but lucky for me I didn't have any.

I am very tempted to try just 10mg oxy to see what happens,for a weekly buzz,no an everyday high,just a treat on a certain day of the week.

Has anybody else had this experience, or can advise on how to get high while using subs. (Started subs 3 weeks ago)....

Cheers guys.",1

The love/hate i have for them is unreal. Im in a 12 Step treatment in Sweden and i really like it. I go to bed early and wish for the next day and go to treatment. Im 20 years old and used 500-800mg oxy every day for 3 mounths straight. Its hard asfuck to kick it and it is possible. 2 weeks ago getting a glas water was mission imposible for me. Now i can take a shower and enjoy it. Ive started to get back feelings that i cant describe. Ive never gone this far and im aiming for a mounth. Ive been to NA and AA every day this week and i look forward for it. My family pushed my to quit in past and all i wanted and could think about was the next high. I had to keep using and reach my own bottom and descover my own reason to be sober. That was critical for me, i had to use it so civeirly to the point where i could eat 80mg oxy like it was advil. I remember i took a shot of 4x80mg and boofing it and not feel a damn thing. I was on the poin of overdosing everyday. I woke up 2-5 times a day gasping for air. My body shut down completely, looked like a ghost completely white face and body. I remember i told myself. If i take ome more hit, i would die. And that made me to start caring and start to recover for my own sake, thats my critical point for stayng clean. I havent thought about oxy, bearly nothing. I know it wont give me anything. Already in past 3 weeks i start notecing posetive changes in me. I go to my 12 Step and i can connect my brain and body to my higher power wich is NA and my group. Im a guy from Sweden that is recovering from this hell of a life. I set new bars every morning and challenge myself to to better. One method that helped me alot with withdrawl was to Sauna really hot!Drink 2 liters water and take 2-3cold showers. That helped me so much with stress and urge to have oxy. I deaply recomend to suana and take cold showers. Its better than to take benzos or anyting else for withdrawl. Challenge yourself with an obstle, you will get a reward.

I've had major problems with heroin and a little bit with fentanyl and a little bit with Xanax. I do feel though that just because a person is addicted to one substance does not make them addicted to every single substance. Many of the people who have ran these programs that I've been in have always told me that because I am an addict it is unsafe to use marijuana or any other drugs that aren't prescribed to me. I think that I am not addicted to cocaine nor am I addicted to marijuana nor am I addicted to MDMA or LSD or any other psychedelic and there's no scientific proof they can tell me that someone is addicted to one substance they're addicted to all. I've never even had a problem with drinking. Anyone else have any thoughts on this? 
I found what's best for myself is to continue to smoke weed and occasionally trip a little bit of Lucy or mushies and I know that I'll always be an addict but I truly don't think that I am addicted to every substance.",2

Today is the Fucking day I think to myself. It’s been a long 9 months but I’m so ready for this.

My bunky looks at me and says “pappas I can’t believe it man you’re fucking leaving today, what’re you gonna do?”

“Shit I don’t know probably get a steak and go to a party, then see my girl.”
“That’s wassup bro, now that you’re leaving that means I’ve only got a month now. I’m so fucking close.”
The sergeant hears us and tells us to “shut the fuck up.”

“Yes sir.” I hear myself say. It still pisses me off and I’ve been here 9 months. I do feel bad for some of the other kids, they’ve been here for years. Juvenile DOC is a bitch, they can hold you till you’re 21 if you don’t complete a program.

I go about my day and don’t make a sound, I’m ready to fucking leave this shithole. My dad finally pulls up and I’m called down to receiving. I’ve got all my shit packed and change my clothes. It’s what I was wearing when I got arrested. Jordan’s, camo shorts, DARE t-shirt. No bullshit, the cops thought that was hilarious.

I had been breaking into houses and stole a 1911 .45 and sold it. I got caught on camera and my license plate was on the video too. I was 17 and didn’t know any better. The detectives questioned me and I ended up admitting I did it but didn’t tell them who I sold it too. They did not like that. The judge ended up sentencing me to house arrest and I ran before I got my bracelet put on. Arrest day is another story i hope to get to.

I see my dad walk in with a big ass grin and he laughs at the fat ass CO, she was always a bitch. “Ready to get outta here man?” 

“Hell. Fucking. Yes.” I say back. It’s a long drive back to the Nap, I light a cigarette and take a drag. It is Fucking terrible, it’s been so long that I hate it. I think, I don’t wanna do this anymore, but continue to smoke it. The second one is better.

I get home and do some push ups and pull ups and take a shower. Going to get a steak downtown and I’m Fucking pumped. My dad, sister, billy, and grandma are with me and we have a great time.

Billy is like my brother and he asks “you wanna come over tonight and have a party? I mean like no heroin but everything else hahaha.”
“Yea dude, absolutely. Let’s fucking go.” I go over to his house and pick up the bong, I take one hit and pass it to billy. I’m immediately stoned, I’m chopping up lines of Molly and coke. I snort about a .1 of each to start out. I’m starting to get a decent roll on but the coke is making me tweak a little so I start taking shots to level me out.

I awake

Fuck. Where am I? As I’m looking around it hits me.I was supposed to meet Sarah at my dads at midnight. “FUCK! She’s gonna be fucking pissed.” I say as I sit up and see that it’s dark outside. What the hell I think. “BILLY!!!” I yell and stand up. “What the fuck happened and what day is it?”

“Wednesday.” He grumbles from the couch. Damn he looks rough, his eyes are swollen and hollow, his face is pale, and the trash can is right next to him.

“Bro there’s no fucking way. It was just Monday.”
“Yeah that happens when you take bars and drink dumbass.” He says to me. That Fucking asshole, I think. I didn’t even take any bars.
“Dude I didn’t take any Xanax, just the Molly and coke.”
“Uhm yeah ya did.” He says. “You took like 4 bars and I tried to stop you. You were drunk af and so coked out you wanted to come down.”

Damn, I think. Only 2 nights and i crashed that hard? I really have been gone awhile. “Lemme use your phone, I don’t have one yet. I gotta call Sarah.”
“You really think that’s a good idea? I’m pretty sure she’s still getting high.” He says to me.
“Fuck you man, look at you, I’m chillin with you and we just Fucking ran through a ball of yay in less than 36 hours and a gram of Molly and then blacked out for a day and you wanna preach about getting high?”
“You know it’s different man. Dog food is not the same for you as this shit.” He points to the table that is covered in paraphernalia. Razors blades, baggies, ashes, cigarette butts, 2 small piles of blow and Molly, bottles of Jim beam and svedka, and then a bottle of Xanax.

I kneel down at the coffee table and cut out a line of yay. I snort it, pop a bar, take a shot, and light a cigarette.

“Give me your fucking phone.” I say.
“Here.” He hands me his phone and I type in her number.

It rings once.

Immediately I hear yelling through the speaker. She’s obviously pissed but she’ll get over it I think to myself. “Hey what’s up” I say after she stops screaming.
“What the fuck I waited outside all fucking night the past two nights, what the fuck were you doing?”

“Listen I’ve had a rough couple nights and don’t have a phone, just come by tonight at midnight. I promise I’ll be there” I say.

I go home and pass out again, I wake up to knocking on my window. I know what’s going to happen if I open it, talk to her, and then leave with her.

I don’t wanna do it.

She has a car, money, and a pussy. So I open the window. “What’s up babe?”
“Hey fucker, you actually came through” she says.
“I told you I would, let’s get the fuck outta here” I say.

She has a 2012 Impala with a system and 5% tint on the windows. We hop in the car and immediately start fucking. I bust quickly since it’s the first pussy I’ve had in almost 10 months.

Then we go straight to the trap. We hop out and knock on the door. “Who is it?” We hear a voice through the door.
“It’s AJ.” I say.

I hear the door unlatch and see my plug. Black dude with dreads and tatted up. He’s got cameras all around the house and a couple heroin enthusiasts are shooting up on the couch.

“Wassup wit u bro? You just got out right?”He asks.
“Same shit different day, it’s just good to be out.” I say.
“Shit hell yeah, I feel that, watchu tryna grab?” He asks.
Sarah chimes in and says “how much for a ball?”
“Since he just got out I’ll hook you up for $175.” He says.

He weighs out our sack, puts it in a paper, and hands it to me. “I appreciate you man, mind if we do a quick shot here?” I ask.
“Yea no problem just don’t fuckin od in my house” he says.
“I’m not going to dude, imma be real careful.” I say.

Me and Sarah sit down on the couch and start working on making two shots. As she’s making them I’m thinking to myself how terrible of an idea this is. It’s the first time I’ve ever been 9 months clean since I started using at 14-15.

I don’t want to do it.

She hands me my shot and I start tying my arm off, back when I still had veins in my arms. I gently push the needle through my skin and pull back, blood rushes into the 29g 1ml insulin syringe. I let go of the tie off and slowly push the plunger down. I feel the warm rush up my arm and then through my whole body. “Fuuuckkkk.” I hear myself say.

Then it all goes black.",6

Got my wisdom teeth out at 16, and it was game on from there. Having alcoholic parents made Using a substance as a crutch feel as natural as anything to me. 26 almost 27 now and while I’ve sometimes had years sober, the most I’ve had in the past 3 years is a couple weeks. My boyfriend and I are addicts, together for 9 years this July. Though at the moment, you may not call us “together”. Due to our 7 month old daughter and CPS being involved due to me testing positive for oxycodone, we have hit a point of what feels like no return. Get clean, or lose our daughter. To be honest I know it’s unlikely that we can get clean together. The codependency is so, so real. I haven’t used in 24 hours and I’m struggling something fierce but I have my eye on the prize. I finally told my therapist yesterday that I had relapsed and she called CPS as soon as I left. They were at the house in hours due to aforementioned positive test a few months prior. Our daughter has always been well-cared for, but I realize that’s not the point. Either or both of us could get a bad pill, die, and leave her unattended. What I’m looking for now I guess is someone who can relate, and maybe who can tell me I did the right thing telling my therapist that I needed help cause it truly has dropped a bomb on my entire life and now the pieces I’m looking at just make me wanna use. How fucked is that?",4

On the other hand I know its neccessary. 

Also Im kinda scared of which kind of people I'll meet in the detox facility. I mean, dont want to hate on anyone, but I just cant stand dealing with users of hard drugs (most of them). Well maybe thats too harsh, apologies to my comrades x)

Should i just do that last oxy now instead of dragging it out another day and will the gabapentin help with wd? Ive seen mixed things on multiple subs about whether gabapentin works for wd. Some swear by it others say it doesnt do shit.

I feel like I’ve been living a lie the past 3 years. I’m beyond ready to put this period of my life behind me. A little background - I’m 31, I have 3 college degrees, an incredible career, an amazing partner and two amazing children. I say this because none of that really matters to addiction. I could be superwoman and I’d still not be safe from the grip that this disease can have on you. The worst part is, nobody knows about it. I’ve been so good at being a high functioning addict that I think I’ve even convinced myself I don’t have a problem (absolutely not true anymore, I know I have a huge problem). So unfortunately I will be suffering through this alone. I know that’s not the best idea and that’s why I’m turning to this forum for support and advice. My addiction started with Vicodin about 3 years ago after a c-section. It gradually got worse and I’m currently on pressed 30s. I take 2 - 3 per day. I hate them and I hate that I let this happen. I’m trying to prepare for withdrawals this weekend. I know they will last for awhile but I’m hoping the worst of it will pass sooner than later. I will take time off work if needed and my children will be at their fathers house. I have a few things to help me get through this and I’m open to hearing any and all suggestions. I currently have Valium, gabapentin, Kratom, and immodium. I’ve done all the research on Kratom and realize it is highly addictive. I plan on only taking it as long as absolutely necessary to get through the worst of it because of how high stress my life is.  I appreciate the help and your time. ❤️",10

Juat wondering if anyone has any idea what it could be or more importantly how long the feeling is likely to last? For myself Its by far the worst symptom  and I'm dreading it. 

Not sure if it's relevant but I was taking an average of around 470mg codeine and 250mg tramadol a day. 

I've cut down over the last few weeks and two days ago I took 150mg tramadol and 110mg codeine, 

Last night just 110mg codeine. 

Tonight I'm planning to go full cold turkey but I can already feel my legs and arms getting irritable.  Just wondering how many days its likely to be before it goes off.

I'm re-posting to a new group here to see if anyone is based in New York City to talk.

My name is Adam. I first want to preface this with the fact that I lost my beloved thirty-year-old sister to a fentanyl overdose in 2016. I know there are so many stories like mine, and in part this motivated me to pursue a career in reporting.

I am a graduate student at Columbia School of Journalism, and I'm looking to talk with those who lost someone to an opioid overdose. Maybe your loved one had difficulty seeking treatment due to pandemic-related backlogs or insurance issues. Or their access to rehab sucked, or their relapse and addiction problems were triggered/exacerbated by lockdown. I know it's complex-- I've lived it-- and I've got time to hear you out.

Seeing all these posts about people ""eating clean"" and exercising on week one and two?! You wanna know what my week one and part of two looked like....

Before on opiates I ate once every 2 or 3 days and lived on salad....I probably haven't eaten a hamburger in 5 years (not vegan) or a few pieces of pizza in as many...too vain....not hungry....whatever case was...

My wd looked like me ordering a 60 pack of Frito lay assorted snacks on Amazon (kid snacks we all ate) and am still finding bags that missed my trashcan a week later 🙃 I drank whatever hot bottle of water or Gatorade I left on nightstand....etc....

Now I am someone who money isn't issue (good and bad thing tbh) and have 2 fridges with at least 4 drawers full of fresh fruit and veggies every week and I WAS not getting up-to make anything. 

I had every comfort med and was calling my blanket a bitch for coming off my feet and my my ceiling a cunt just because I was awake.....

I agree clean eating and exercising is good for us all but I think it is unrealistic some of these people saying they were shooting up....boofing....or eating pills a week ago and are working out 5 days a week or joined the gym....
I mean fuck I joined planet fitness a week ago....with a bottle.of wine in one hand and pizza all over my face while in the comfort of my own bed....

I swear I think some people think eating clean is not stopping at McDonald's on way home or eating the twinkie out of top of garbage can they threw away being high night before....

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. So for some background ive been doing heroin (now fentanyl/heroin mix) since I was 16. Been a “junkie”, first went to rehab etc at 18. I’m 26 now. I’m a female, I graduated college, work a good full time job. I’ve lived on my own basically my entire 20s until this year when I moved home after going to rehab last summer. I’m from a major east coast coast city and this stuff is everywhere. 

I had a year clean- longest I’ve ever had- but relapsed last spring. And other than a month or so have been going pretty steady. I honestly mostly only use at night, usually two or three times from when I get home till i go to bed. My parents are amazing. Normal. Smart. Healthy. They even will hit a joint; so they’re no squares they obviously just want the best for me. After a series of unfortunate events these past couple weeks my using has come back to light and my parents are devastated and really just over it. I have the money to move out so I’m trying to decide if that’s what I’m  gonna do. 

Anyway. The point of this Post is last night, after doing my last bag I realized this really needs to be it. I have a ton of benzos stockpiled for the WD, my psychiatrist even called me in subs, and usually im pretty tough. I got the vivatrol  shot high, went into precip and had multiple seizures from benzo wd in Ireland with zero medication. But those are stories for another day. However I don’t want to stop. I want so badly to want to. I know it’s time. I know people are dying left and right. Hell, I found my own boyfriend of 5 years dead of an OD. I’ve been thru the ringer with this shit. Overdoses, sepsis, bone infection, surgery, family turmoil, homelessness, multiple rehabs in multiple states. You get the idea. 

I know that they say you can’t get clean until you want it. So now what? If I could buy a magic pill that would make me ready id empty my bank account for it. I also deal with severe depression so there’s that. Part of me thinks I’ll just get high forever and have to find a way to work it into my lifestyle. But I know That’s unrealistic. Or I’ll just die. I don’t know what I’m looking to hear. But if someone can offer some feedback or experience I’d greatly appreciate it.  Should I just fake it till I make? Anyone have any words of wisdom for a fellow fiend? Thanks In advanced",6

So scared I would rather die then go thru detox and the wds, being in a hospital, but mostly going away to rehab for approx 30 days. Not so much scared to give up this drug that the only thing I get from it is sleep, which isn’t enjoyable when I literally sleep around 15 hrs give or take a day. I’m exhausted from sleeping so much. 

As bad as my depression has gotten I would rather go somewhere that they will help with my mental health also and not just the addiction especially considering having to be away for so long. I’d hate to go away for addiction then get out and have to go in to a psych ward. 

I’m scared of wds, scared they won’t give me enough meds to keep me comfortable, scared I’ll run again and go back to using, scared the cravings will be too intense, scared of the nightmares I have, scared to feel all the emotions and feelings I’ve been numbing for years, scared I’ll go thru it and I’ll still be sad and still not able to get on my feet. Hell you name it I’m probably scared of it honestly!

But I’m not even sure where to go that even will help with only having state insurance anyway, but even if I knew just thinking about it has me so scared all I want is to die. I’m not actively trying, but the thought is definitely there. 

Has anyone else experienced this and if so what did you do? Or anyone have any advice or suggestions? I desperately need it and would greatly appreciate it! I’m losing my shit fr.",1

I'm fresh off methadone and doing great minus this sharp, shooting pain. Originally, I kept passing it off as constipation from opiates. Now that I'm off of them and it's still happening, ehhhh not sold on that anymore. 

My obgyn is pointing me toward a GI so we can figure out what is going on. I'm in 100% agreement that this is definitely a GI issue now. It isn't constant. I can eat small amounts of food and be a-ok for weeks and then the pain creeps back randomly. I feel good when I don't eat. It doesn't seem to be on a cycle with my hormones. Pretty serious fatigue and bloating after eating makes me look pregnant and I'm a twig of a woman. Then the food hits my lower intestines and all hell breaks loose. Sharp, shooting pain all over my body- left lower abdomen, pectoral muscles, my right shoulder? It's so random, but it is enough to make me double over.

Pretty extreme amount of vomiting back when I was using, not eating for long periods of time, no regular food schedule. Then there's the whole boofing U4 thing which was *highly* corrosive. But I would think that if it was from shoving RCs up my ass, the pain wouldn't come and go, plus that was years ago at this point.

Obviously, stress ulcers are a thing, but has anyone heard of GI issues specifically caused by opiate use? I'd be shocked if I made it out of that period of my life without doing lasting damage.",9

I had the idea of buying a lot of methadone or even gear and giving it to him daily until his appointment for a script is sorted out. I tried giving him money but we know what happened to that. 

I just feel that every service available to help this individual is really not able to. If you could walk in to the drug service and get on a script that would work - this kind of person can’t make or keep an appointment, and even if he could, the chaos of his life and addiction would make it really hard…

I've used just about every opiate...some IV but all pharma. I have been on OC alone for the past year and have only taken it orally. So I did a very rapid taper and jumped CT from 60mg/day

Since I've been through this more than a few times, I've fine tuned my process. I thought maybe someone here would get some use from what I learned the hard way.

1. It isn't ever going to be easier to quit than it is today. Don't wait till after the holidays or after one more project, etc. You will come up with a million reasons to delay.... don't.

2. Clear some time...at least 5 days. Make sure you have lots of comfortable clothes, extra sheets, a heating pad, a fan, epsom salt, and easily prepared foods. 

2. Stock up on whatever form of weed you like, but be sure you have some edibles that contain at least a 4-1 CBD to THC ratio. Take them liberally. *Avoid Sativa for the first week*

3. OTC meds I used were loperimide (at the dose on the package) and ibuprofen. You may want to add a sleep aid. Just avoid diphenhydramine as it can increase RLS.

4. AVOID STIMULANTS for at least 3wks. You think they will give you the energy you are desperate for but they will make you feel much much worse. 

5. Hot baths with epsom, Netflix, music, sex, sunshine and stubbornness were my friends but weed was the real savior. 

6. I started Wellbutrin at 3 weeks, it helps with the anhedonia and fatigue. I did a moderate amount of shrooms yesterday and I feel like I got a bit of a brain reset. I doubt I will do them again...they are not my favorite.

7. I purposely did not use any benzos, gabapentin or Kratom. I have used all three in the past and I felt like they extended the WD ...plus they are all addictive.

It is going to suck...embrace that and just let it flow through you. Weirdly, I find watching shows about drug use helpful. I binged them all, but the documentaries about the Sacklers and Purdue made me super angry. It is partly that anger that keeps me from using.

I've felt pretty good for the last week. My energy is increasing and I feel content. I did not think that was possible a month ago.",36

Anyway I've been getting slowly better over the last few months, managing to take it either every other day, or a few days off followed by a binge...but never managing more than 3/4 days clean...but it's hard trying to plan for going through WD alongside my job (I'm in Cyber Security so I need to be on the ball)..i always plan to deal with the worst few days on the weekend (usually day 3/4)...but currently I just can't seem to get past that damn 4th day...either because I'm WDing badly and I get freaked out about dealing with it at work (not knowing if day 5 will be as bad or better)..or literally the total opposite, I get lucky, and my WD is actually not that bad at all this time around, and I end up convincing myself that I should ""reward my hard work""....which is so f***ing dumb...
I even took time off work specifically to deal with this...but I just ended up wasting it all by getting high towards the end of that time off....

I wake up in a cold sweat, it’s only been a week but that’s how fast it happens now. I grab my stack of blue hundreds and smell them for some dopamine I’m so desperately needing… It works but the relief is fleeting, this time no heroin is guaranteed on the end of that crisp hundred. I have no idea where I am let alone where to buy heroin. 

I left rehab a week ago, got paid for my services and decided to head home, fuck I love California. I buy a quarter oz of some tar thinking that should be enough to drive back home to Napghanistan… it was not.

My girl hears me stirring and sees me eyeing our nice stack of 60 Benjamin’s. “This should last us for at least a couple weeks” she says… It does not.
I pack a bowl of marijuana, I don’t even smoke but it’s kind of mandatory being out west where it’s legal. I inhale and wish it tasted like vinegar, instead it tastes of exotic purple, disappointing.

The hotel is nice, I climb into the jacuzzi naked and immediately think of Fucking, opiate withdrawal is a strange mistress. I’ve fucked her probably 12 times this week and haven’t came once. I tell my girl I would like some head and she happily obliges. Finally I feel some sweet relief as her lips work my dick and I cum down her throat.
Ahh dopamine… it is fleeting. I wish her throat was heroin, alas it is not. I smoke more and decide to start my plan of action, find the worst rated motel nearby and pray.

I turn into the motel with my windows down and look at everyone I see, the mating call of the junky. First car I pass, tweaked bitch in the front seat clutching a mtn dew, perfect. We both stop and look at each other, she recognizes the look on my face… desperation. “Black?”She asks.
 “black” I reply.
 “How much?”
 “Ball.”
 “300” she says.
She must  think I’m retarded, either that or she sees the ray bans on my face and my tinted out explorer and thinks I have money. I do, but not 300 a ball money. “200” I say.
She eyes me and says “alright.”
 That was easy.

I’m flying back to the hotel excited, copping still feels the same 10 years later I think to myself. My girl is rapping to Kevin gates as I pull up, as happy as I am. 

We’re walking past the front desk when I hear “excuse me sir.”
I look over and see a small gay man looking at me from behind the desk. “Our housekeepers are complaining of the smell of marijuana, and it’s coming from your room” he says.
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me I think to myself. “I don’t know what you’re talking about I say.”

… It is obvious I am the cause. “We know it’s you, just please stop smoking in the room” he asks.
“Ok” I reply… I do not.

I make it back to the room and run to the couch and drop the black ball on the coffee table. Ahh dopamine… it is fleeting. Knowing I’m going to be playing with needles for the next two hours kills my natural high and weed high.

I make two shots and tie off my leg, I pray I find the red flash on my first try… I do. Sweet dopamine… it is fleeting.

Through the fog of opiated bliss I hear a voice, wait I know that voice I think to myself. I do not care though, nothing matters. Until I realize my sternum does, she is rubbing furiously shouting words. “Narcan, shot, mine, fuck, I’ll do it.”
“Don’t even think about it bitch”, I mumble.
“Then do mine!!” She banshee screams.
I stab her in a spot I know won’t hit but I pray it does… it does. It is fleeting, I nodded out and pulled it out. Fuck!!!

The girl is pissed, which means no dopamine for me until she’s satisfied… I narcan myself. Fuck did I really just do that? I ask myself as the white plastic hits the coffee table… I did.

I hurry and find a vein on her with the quickness knowing within minutes I’ll be stretching and retching until my back breaks.

The relief of injecting her is fleeting, I missed. She’s unhappy, I’m unhappy, we’re unhappy… even that is fleeting. She’s smoking it, she’s better. Thank fuck. I make a shot while I sweat and shake. I inject it into new ol faithful…

But the relief is fleeting",16

As a result, I've come to a decision to go to a residential treatment facility for 14 days to build the foundation I need to get a handle on some of my trauma, addiction, and chronic pain. The rehab I'm going to specializes in chronic pain.

1. I work for a union
2. My boss is understanding and compassionate

I've considered going to my union rep before approaching my boss but I don't know if that is standard protocol or not.

Currently, I plan to start the conversation by saying to the office manage something along these lines, ""If I needed to take a two week leave of absence who/where would I go to address that?"" After that I feel like I'd be left floundering with the onslaught of questions that will surely follow.

My parents are mentally ill, they have some disturbing issues that make it extremely uncomftorable to be around.  I'm going to be making a trip to get to the other side of the country, I don't have work lined up, I don't have any money except for the ticket but its going to be worth it.  I have physical disabilites that get in the way of me working, but i'm just going to suck it up and maybe try and get a job at good will or something.  I get money handed to me but it's extremely manipulative if I do something that they don't approve of, I don't see any food or anything for awhile, and it's just too much, cause I know i'm not doing anything wrong, they are both control freaks, I'm too old to be doing this, i've messed up every time leaving ( having to beg for a ride home because I haven't showered or slept regularly in 3 weeks, and it's extremely difficult to start somewhere with no money and no one to even associate with.  I'm not asking for money btw that's the last thing I'm asking. ( I hated begging and holding up signs when i was homeless, I choose to starve, and suffer the consequences, I wouldn't even steal something as simple as bag of chips or ramen due to being paranoid that I would b F'd if I did)

It's an extremely abusive manipulative relationship, my parents are stupid filthy rich, and there apart of some sketchy organizations, that I will not name, just to make this shorter and for some privacy.

I'm five years clean (with intermittent suboxone use,  and this is going to be the hardest thing i've ever done because i will be awake and conscious and sober for it all.  I have food stamps and cash benefits I can get that I left unused and untouched it should be pretty easy to get.  damn, I realized I've been slowly going neurotic, telling myself just save money eat less etc, but i dont get enough to save anything, it's specifically calculated to keep me trapped here. i've been downing my sleeping meds (non narcotic), and taking more and more suboxone just to numb my mind from all the chaos recently and it's not going to get better unless i change something.

This place has helped me a lot, partly because of anonymity, and also because it's a healthy community, and thats what I'm looking for.  for those who've had shit hit the fan unexpectedly even after doing everything you think is right, shit still happens.  I'm going to be stronger from this, I'm going to learn valuable lessons, part of this is going to be exciting as hell, because I'm a travel junkie and the rush of the unknown and the hardships, of finding a shower, and a warm place to sleep I find revitalizing, if you've ever slept on cold concrete in a giant city filled with millions, and doing it sober, which i've done before, it gave me a new appreciation for something as simple as a bed, or a heater working during winter ( i've never slept the same in a bed since experiencing homelessness).  I'm currently reading the book ""how to unfuck yourself"", and it's been a god send, if anyone has time to read it, you can also check it out for free through audiobook on youtube.

anywho,  anyone here who feels ugly, and feels like life is unfair, just try imagining having one arm, or one leg, or one  eye, that's the level of suffering i've dealt with, I would kill to have a 9 - 5 job, where at least im independent, but because my physical image is off by society standards and I totally understand that, i have to find a different path, where I don't feel extremely uncomfortable knowing the manager made a mistake because I hid my deformity in the interview.

I don't know what I would do also without seroquel, at first i was like oh wow all these negative side effects eh its not that great.  noo, it is.  if your being too overwhelmed with life you can also use it for severe depression, it's also used off label for anxiety.  i don't kno who to trust, what to do, other than to run, and leave. but it's going to happen this, and I don't plan on returning, I also want to change my name to really dissapear, if anyone has experience starting new and creating a new identity any tips would help, i have no record, and that's not why i'm starting new, anyways enough ranting.  had to get this off my chest, I'm 28 years old.",3

I made a post about 5 months ago about suicide and how bad I was struggling with my addiction to fentanyl and Xanax. Issues with my wife and I also was dealing with a court case for 2 possession charges in Florida (horrible state to catch charges in)

I was thinking I was going back to prison, I was out on bond. Since I was always getting high and barely knew what day of the week it was I ended up showing up to court on the wrong day and was just nodding out sitting for them to call my name. Well the officer in court noticed asked my name and said I had court the day before and the judge had me arrested and bonds revoked for Failure to Appear. 

The detox was horrible, I was hallucinating, I was shitting my pants and throwing up, I was trying to fight people because I thought they took my cell phone. The worst parts was hallucinating, I thought I was witnessing my wife getting killed, I thought I was in a rocket ship shooting nukes and countless other ridiculous hallucinations that felt so real. It was the scariest thing I ever experienced and I'm not exaggerating about any of it.

I was put in a psych cell and was given a turtle suit as we call it, no clothes, no boxers, no sheets or blanket,  just a smock type of clothing to wear and was forced to ride out the detox like that. It felt like I didn't sleep a wink for 20 or more days.  Because of the amounts of Xanax I was using they did give me Ativan for about 2 weeks to try and wean me off.  

What I went through was pure hell, but around the 40th day mark things starting looking up. I was sleeping better and getting my mental right. Im 6`2 and when I went in I was barely 135 pounds, I'm now 180 pounds and stronger then I've ever been.

I focused solely on reading, eating, working out and sleeping as much as I could. I made mends with my wife and family. Spent alot of time recognizing why I feel the need to use and what it is im trying to escape from. 

I ended up hiring a lawyer and got a sweet deal and was sentenced to 6 months, with gain time I was released 2 days ago.  

Ive been clean since October, I'm following up with therapists and I've honestly haven't felt this healthy ever before in my life. I know the work isn't over yet and I need to continue focusing on healing. 

I want to thank everyone in this sub who reached out and thank you to everyone whose shared their stories because when I found this sub just reading the posts planted the seed in my head about finally getting clean. I unfortunately couldn't do it on my own and was forced to do it in jail. 

There's hope for all who are struggling, if you have the opportunity to go to rehab take it.

I'm going to listen to my doc this time and stay on the subs for a while, since a 1 week rapid taper didn't work for me last time.

2022-02-12 09:01:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/sqs7eb/hormone_replacement_while_tapering_off_suboxone/,Hormone Replacement While Tapering off Suboxone,"**UPDATE:** Approximately 20 days in to my taper - see below original post for my update.  


Hello,

Wanted to share my experience in the hopes that it helps someone else. First, **this is not medical advice.**

This is my third time on Suboxone, I've spent two previous 2.5 year spans on this medication, and weaned down successfully only to relapse on Kratom both times - eventually leading to harder opioids. This time I have limited myself to 1 year maximum, and am currently at 30% of a 2mg pill and decreasing. All is going well.

This time is different, as I got a blood workup done, and my hormones came back as totally shut down from the Suboxone, and also perhaps my age, as I'm now 31 :/ I have started taking Testosterone Cypionate as well as Somatotropin (HGH) for hormone replacement to correct this - at therapeutic doses. I am using pharmaceutical prescribed products.

There are studies suggesting that HGH has powerful neuroprotective mechanisms that may help addicts, as well as assist in regulating the brain in recovery: [Can HGH Reverse Brain Damage in Drug Addicts? - Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-hgh-reverse-brain-dam/). HGH is also shown to stimulate neurogenesis, which would - at least in theory - help with learning new behaviors (such as living clean).

There is also a lot of anecdotal reports of people having more success detoxing after taking hormone replacement therapy (or only TRT), as it seems to help the body do it's thing more efficiently. It also may explain why people have a harder time quitting suboxone after being on it many years, as I didn't start getting shut down until after around 8 months to a year on it.

I measure my suboxone doses using a 0.001g precision scale, where a 2mg generic pill actually weighs 100mg. I am able to decrease my dose of buprenorphine therefore by 0.02mg amounts - and so I already take a pretty controlled approach to my taper. I am very curious to see how the hormone replacement regiment affects my experience with the taper - which I will be finished with in under 5 weeks now.

**Does anyone have experience with this? Or even just TRT while on Suboxone or Methadone?** I will update this post to let you know how this is going, as well as the most critical part IMO - if it helps with stopping the pill in the final stage of the taper - mentally and physically. I will also be upping my exercise regiment, as I know exercise helps greatly in withdrawal.

Looking forward to seeing how this goes!  


=== UPDATE 3/3/2022 (close to 3 weeks since starting T and 2.5 weeks with HGH ===  


Although I am entering the main window of effectiveness for Testosterone Cypionate only now (longer esters tend to take a while to reach stable plasma levels and have therapeutic effects), I am convinced this is having a **dramatic** effect on my recovery.

I struggled to taper down even 5% amounts previously. Since starting this protocol, I am finding the taper is becoming easier - not harder. I have managed to reduce my dose by almost **half** in the past 3 weeks, and I only had intermittent periods of minor discomfort. 

My mood is significantly elevated. Joint pain is gone. Energy levels are up. Optimism is 200% of what it was. I am guessing these psychological effects are helping me tremendously, but I'm also becoming convinced that correcting hormonal deficiencies (or even temporarily causing an intentional spike in hormone levels) has a substantial effect in aiding the body in recovery. It makes sense - increased T and HGH dramatically improve the bodies ability to recover from just about everything - why not also upregulation of receptors and therefore dependency as well?

I should note that I have also increased my weight lifting regiment - which is also making me feel good. Also, not sure if I mentioned this, but I consume 10mg edibles (Canadian - legal here) 2 hours before bed every night, and this helps immensely with symptoms of withdrawal - and allows for great sleep. I would highly recommend this over sleeping medications, as I feel it has a direct pain-killing effect as well that seems to really help with more than sleep. I would use it during the day too, but my fiance doesn't want a stoned zombie walking around the house, and I'm a full time Sr software developer, so I can't fuck that up either.

Anyway, I'm ranting. This seems to be working, so far it's a two thumbs up from me, and the real test will be when I completely stop the pill. I plan to eventually taper off the hormone interventions, but only after I'm totally back to normal and off the suboxone.

Thanks!",2

I arrived last night to my apartment where I live with my college best friends, after having lived with my parents for the last month after treatment. A commitment to sobriety at tender age of 21. Going up the stairs to my floor, it was such a routine feeling. A trip I had made many times before while sick and nose dripping, layers of clothes and sweat in my hairline, on my way back up from the dope-man’s car. This time was different, I felt renewed and healthy. With a bounce in my step, I felt lucid. I was met with many “you look great!”-type comments. I was met with a sense of normalcy. Being able to look my friends in the EYES while I talk to them because I am no longer too high with a glassy look to do so, not nodding off mid conversation. I feel empowered. My sparkle is back.

Today, I accidentally found a wax-sealed bag of dope, deep in my drawer, unopened and inviting me just once more. Here comes a very real sense of heartbreak. My old friend. The one who kept me warm during the bad and lonely nights. The friend who stuck by my side, was always available for me, and knew just how to cheer me up. 

I held that bag in my hands for ten minutes, going back and forth with myself. “Just once more, who would it hurt? Who has to know?”
I started to cry. What a manipulative bitch opiates are. 
The friend who made me sell my body in order to keep them around. A pimp that doesn’t have a payroll. The friend who constantly has to have my attention, there is no more “me” time, there is no more “me”. The needy friend who purposely takes me away from those who love me the most, “You don’t need anyone but me” “It's me and you against the world"". What a manipulative bitch opiates are. 

I flushed it, after much hesitation of course. Bye bye, old friend. The worst friend. I sat on the floor for an hour afterwards with a lonely feeling in my chest. This was an emptiness similar to when you’re all by yourself after the end of a great trip with friends, the silence is unfamiliar, and it simply doesn’t feel natural. But soon it will feel normal. 

It’s me against the world. Today, I choose me. Today, I choose sobriety.",45

I have a few things to help but I’m scared they’re only prolonging my true sobriety and withdrawals. So I have a couple xtampza 18mg’s, those seem to curb the unbearable sweats/chills, and some Valium that is helping me get a tiny bit of rest. But if these are only going to prolong I want to stop and just get this done with. On top of that I have a double ear infection which I’m supposed to be taking antibiotics for so I feel like absolute hell. I have to do this, I left my abusive ex fiancé in June who got my into this addiction again. (I was previously addicted when I was 17/18 to Xanax and percocets and got clean at 19). Met him when I was 20, got pregnant 2 months in, then when I had my daughter and our relationship started spiraling drugs were the only thing that made us not fight. I left with the clothes on my back and my daughter and moved back in with my mom. My family is clueless when it comes to my addiction although I believe they’re starting to catch on.

And now I'm doing more pills than i ever was.. Does anyone have advice to just make the jump and bit pick up anymore? I even have some meds to help, and kratom. But no therapist or rehab or anything.

That was the stress of an addiction on someone that didn’t need to have it. She made me so whole and that was the girl I want to marry. I took for granted her being on my ass, trying to keep me on track, loving me even when she was mad. She tried everything to get me to see it or to get my attention even after the hell I put her through. She wanted to make it work and I put everything else over her, things that shouldn’t have been. It was over a dumb reason and I seen it too late, I could have fixed it easily. Sometimes when I think of relapsing it doesn’t help that she’s not here anymore. I was cold, distant, and mean, and she tried her hardest. I may be sober but I lost something I needed. Now she doesn’t talk to me and my pride is too high to text her or call her again.

Yes I do think PAWS is real....but I also think as addicts and or ppl who found this ""magic pill"" to fix it we have become accustomed to the instant fix and or instant gratification of our issues....and that adds to the issue of taking time to reset our minds. 

No I will not use again.....not even a question.....but I do think I became used to the ""instant fix"" of issues....even though it never really did....lol....I do....

I am hoping long hours of sleep comes soon...one thing I struggle with still....I hate benzos and have hundreds and think took 3 during this whole WD time...also the lack of care and motivation.....I can see it improving but still don't like it. 

I am Italian and a strong ass woman....so feeling weak is not something I am used to feeling...I am open and accepting of this process yet can't help but feel and know I ""bought"" it....unintentionally or not.....

There is a part of me who truly thinks I reset my head on this instant reward system and knows I have to reprogram it all back....

I don't know how opiates managed to creep into the picture, but they did. I sat down and did some math and It's basically been on and off for the past year. I'll go a month to 2 months without and then the old familiar ""I just want to take a mental vacation"" pops in. I need better coping strategies. 

I don't have much of a support system, so I'm kind of freaking out here. I was hoping to check in from time to time to help me get through the next couple of days, and then further on as I know the physical wd's are only the first part of the battle. 

I've been taking 4-6 5mg percs (all pharma) per day since just before Christmas. I also started alternating snorting 16+mg of hydromorphone when I could get it. The hydros went on for 2 weeks solid until a few days ago. The last 2 days have been a little painful as I switched back to percs. I decided today is the day and flushed my stash. I'm going on 19 hours now since the last dose and my withdrawal is mild. However, I'm having constant thoughts like it's never going to feel better (I know it will), and everything is uncomfortable. I know this is hella mild compared to what I've read here, but it still sucks ass. 

As to what's going to be different this time? Every time I've quit, I immediately launch myself into trying to achieve every possible goal. What I'm resolving to do this time is not to do that, but instead, focus on just doing what I can every day. Perhaps I can start adding in a goal or two in a few months, but I want to put some distance between myself and this crap. 

To summarize, I guess I'm looking for some encouragement or to simply know a heartbeat on the other end is there because I feel so alone right now. Thank you :)",5

Since  about 2 days I've been tryna quit tramadol....it became to easy to  compulsively redose, I started being insanely tired from it the entire  (tho it really helped me sleep well...now that luxury is gone) and I  just felt like this is not gonna lead me down a good path. I've been  addicted to weak opiates for about 2 years, it was only recently that I  could not get a hold of the stuff I usually used (codeine or smthn  similar) and all I could get was tramadol. Been usin it for about 3  months everyday, whilst recently averaging doses of about 360mg a day.

It's  day 2...my sleep was awful and I have this insane vertigo/dizzyness,  like the most intense I ever had. I get super annoying hot and cold  flashes and my heart is beating as if I was nervous the entire time. And  of course a veil of depression is back in my life...the sad thing is  the tramadol lifted my depression really nicely...but overall I felt like this would not be a good thing in the long term. And the only source I have is  pretty expensive so I simply figured its just not gonna work long term.

First of all do you know any over the counter/natural remedies to ease the symptoms I mentioned, like certain supplements/whatever other techniques you know ?

(F 23),"To make a long story short, I am a heroin addict. I was from 18-22. I was put on suboxine, I take either a half or a whole one each day, depending on how I feel. When prescribed this medication, I was told withdrawals are the same length and severity as heroin, and I wasn’t told it would rot my teeth. I have been on subs for 14 months. I take amazing care of my teeth. I brush twice a day and floss at least 20 minutes a day. I recently went to the dentist and had 10 cavities! I was so confused and freaked out. I now know it is from suboxine. I am not touching it again. This is a huge deal to me. My mom has been sober and on subs for 8 years. Last year all of her teeth rotted and fell out and she didn’t know why. She was beautiful and confident and now she has agoraphobia and severe depression. I don’t want veneers or dentures, and I can’t afford either. I got the cavities filled but I don’t want to need any more dental work. 
I am prescribed 50mg vyvanse and I have heard that can help with withdrawals, and I am trying to get a sublocade shot but the problem is I haven’t gotten my sub prescription in months since I can’t afford it so i have been using left over subs from my prescription. (My doctor was prescribing 3 a day trying to get me to go up when i didn’t want to so i have a ton extra)
If a doctor wont give me the shot, how do i taper in the easiest most painless way? I am planning on using as little kratom as possible to get through the withdrawals and also hoping the vyvanse helps the withdrawals not be as severe. I work and am in school.

I knew I would have to quit one day but if you asked me in December if I would be done with this shit by February I would have probably laughed.

After the first two weeks it's been pretty easy. I didn't realize how much my cravings were actually dictating my life. The excuses I would make! Those are gone now.

The only tough part now is dealing with my hip pain (I'm only 30. Go figure.) Did something to it a few nights ago while dancing around in my room and now it's been bothering me. a month ago I would have not even hesitated to take 1-2 pills for it. Now I just take advil & aleve. Doesn't really help but I REALLY wanted to make it to 30 days LOL.

When I decided to quit, I wasn't going to quit forever. I wanted to make it until the superbowl (an arbitrary time frame. No significance.) Now I have no plans on touching it again unless I'm REALLY in a lot of pain. Doing my very best to deal with it like a normal person would.

I'm not one to be proud of myself. I gave up on my career dreams many years ago and have been searching for something to fill that void. Dreamed I would be in love, married, living in a nice house by the time I reached 30. I'm not. Still single, living at my mom's trying to help her with the mortgage while we struggle through this pandemic.

But I have these 30 days. I did it by myself. If I can do this, Surely I can go after some other lingering dreams too.

Adding up ALL the little things helps SO much. It's so easy to underestimate or forget one. Of course just a changed diet doesn't fix all my health & mental problems. But combine it with exercise, sunlight, nature, a SAD lamp, and 7 out of 10 days feel quite manageable.

I find myself and what I achieved in the past year(s) pretty decent. Let everybody else hate it; they can't take my self worth away.

I wonder when the next bomb hits, and what it will be. Sick / dead family member, my health, poverty?",11

Dextromethorphan. 

I like many people had severe insomnia during the early withdrawals, I decided to take around 15/20mg dextromethorphan daily during this period and it helped me get to sleep abs calmed me down. Also if I had a night where I slept for only like 2 hours and felt like a zombie the next day, a safe 15/20mg dextromethorphan dose literally picked me right up and I no longer felt tired. 

I get dxm can be controversial and many people have an opinion on it, I just wanted to share mines in relation to opiate withdrawal and how it did help me. Baring in mind I took safe doses, not a massive tripping dose.

Some successful, some not. If I had gotten my way, I would have caved today.  By Gods grace I did not.

I’m alive, though the life that the cancers have left me with is very challenging, to say the very least! Opiates are prescribed to me for pain relief and I must say, they have been a god-send.

But today I saw a locum doctor (not my usual Doc) and he’s suggested that I try something different - the Longtec tablets instead of the Shortec.  Presently, I’m on 10 x 20mg IR tablets per day - but changing to Longtec would mean going from 200mg per day to 160mg per day. This instantly made me panic and I highlighted this point, although his rationale was that the 160mg slow release were actually stronger than 200mg instant release. This obviously makes zero sense to me (because the equivalent of 200mg of the same drug, is 200mg?) - yet it checks out on conversion charts - how fkin confusing is this?

But then he said “But I’ll prescribe you 20 x 20mg IR tablets as well, because initially the slow release tablets will not be as effective, and your body will need to ‘acclimatise’ to them and you will have withdrawal symptoms if you don’t cover yourself with some IR medication”.   At this point I’m not impressed with this Doctor at all but I have zero experience with slow release tablets so I’m in a world of confusion right now🤷‍♂️.

If any of you guys out there have some experience with Slow Release Oxycodone and can shed light on these anomalies, I would be extremely grateful🙏",2

Now I want to get off the dirty thirties but I don’t know if my wd is just the dirty 30’s or the benzos or a combo of of both.

I called about 10 detox centers and finally found one that specializes in Bezos and opioids only. They know importance of a long taper when it comes to benzos even though acute part will be rapid. I’m a strong person. I can handle wd as long as I know I’m not going to die. I’ve had a seizure before about 5 years ago but That’s because I was taking 60mg Xanax in a weeks time and I ran out.

Anyway I have the option of going to this detox to get off the dirty 30s and Xanax (which I switched to Valium this week). I don’t know if if the benzo accute wd is in my head due to the the dirty 30’s or what. The doctor says the problem is my lack of human interaction (I work from home and dont have a car so my home is my world), and I think the doc is right here. I just don’t have the support. 

He wants me to do a medical detox for 10-14 days, then put on comfort drugs and do IOP for 3 months after so I can still work.

My debate is I work a very high profile job and Im worried about leaving 10-14 days out of th3 blue. We’re in the middle of projects. I need this job due to the remote aspect. I don’t want to lose it. Firing someone over medical detox is illegal in my state but you know, companies can always find a “different reason” to let you go.

Also, I do have a 8mg Suboxone I plan to try and take but will not take it for a couple days due to me putting myself in precipitated before and that TERRIFIES me as that was the worst feeling I’ve ever felt, so im looking for something to help until I feel comfortable enough to take the sub! Please don’t lecture me on your negative opinions on Kratom or Imodium for withdrawals I know the risks, however I think using these medications for a few days to lessen the symptoms so I can finally stop using is worth the risks!",1

Has anyone ever experienced skin purging after coming off of opiates? One of the (many) reasons I decided to get clean was that my hormonal acne had gotten pretty bad and I thought maybe that was the cause. first two weeks were ok, but after three weeks, I started REALLY breaking out. Painful acne all around my chin.

I'm no stranger to acne, and I've always thought some of my breakouts were caused by my norco use (or the fact that I wasn't going to the bathroom) I'm thinking maybe my body is realizing that I'm off for good and is trying to regulate it's hormones again?

Just wondering if anyone has any insight on this. Thanks!",2

My hope is that it my help someone out there and it may establish some amount of personal accountability. I recognize that 3 weeks is nothing, I am not out of the woods yet, and the “road to recovery” is never ending. 

3 weeks ago today was one of the worst days of my life. I was a little over a day into WDs from moderate to heavy IV heroin use. I had plenty of comfort meds including suboxone, lyrica, benzos, and gabapentin, which likely softened the blow, but not to the degree to which I expected. Here are some of my lessons learned thus far: 

&#x200B;

* Suboxone works but not in the way I was expecting. I was using fent-free heroin so I incrementally took 8mg suboxone at the 24hour mark thinking I would feel mostly better. (You have to wait longer if you are using fent). This could not have been farther from the truth. My WDs strengthened until the 60 hour mark at which point I began to feel slightly better. 
* It is no secret that benzos can help, but they can easily present problems of their own. If you’re going to use benzos, have a plan for how much and how long you will use them and try to stick to it. If I ever have to do this again, I will try to use them for sleep during the first week and for the worst of the WDs only. 
* Its also very easy to keep taking suboxone beyond the date you intended to be off it. 
* So much of my focus was on getting through the first 4-5 days but for me, it was really bad for about 2.5 weeks. 
* Establishing a large support network can be helpful especially during the post-acute withdraw phase. Going to NA meetings was helpful too.
* One of the two moments at which I believe I was at the highest risk of relapse was at the 24 hour mark when the WDs started getting really bad. The other was after about 2.5 weeks when I started to feel substantially better. I found that once I started feeling better, the terrible memory of WDs began to fade and my addict lizard brain began to reengage itself. This is where a support network, meetings, staying active, hobbies…etc have helped for me thus far.  
* My emotions during this proces have felt like a 36 sided die. When I feel really awful, I try to tell myself that it will pass. No feeling is permanent.",21

My brother is asking for help to recover. He refuses rehab. I’m at a loss.,"I want to help him but I don’t think he can do this on his own. I don’t think I can trust him in my house which has my mom, my wife, and my daughter residing here, unless he finishes a full course of in-patient rehab. 

Opiates change people. He’s not himself with them. I plan to tell him that he can’t come across country back home unless he commits to in-patient rehab and out-patient afterward. Is this a bad idea? 

Backstory:
My brother left to Seattle from San Diego 5 or so years ago. He’s been addicted to opiates (fentanyl 1-2 years) for 4 years on and off. He’s been on Xanax for even longer, but recently switched to a lower dose of klonopin. 

We had a religious upbringing. The doomsday cult of jehovah’s witnesses. That along with an aunt whom he was close to dying after a years long rough battle with cancer have influenced him a lot. Due to leaving the religion, he now has no friends back him. He’s isolated in Seattle. 

My brother claims that he won’t do traditional rehab, but only a spiritual one (psychedelic therapy). He claims that the trauma of hospitals, from my aunt who died, is what gives him “ptsd” from hospital settings. He’s said that over a year or so, but I think it’s an excuse. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m 25 and he’s 30.",2

I started abusing oxycodone 80's at 21 id get a box of 28 every 2 weeks. One thing lead to another and I lost my plug and found out about the Opiate Replacement Program, such a blessing but a curse almost wish I just stopped the Oxy. Anyway I've been clean off oxy for 4 years but been on both Methadone and suboxone since 2018, have had time off of it my best was 7 months qnd a few 4 - 6 weekers. Average methadone dose was 60mg and my average suboxone dose was 60mg. However over the last year I got up to 100mg of methadone and wanted to get onto suboxone so I did the bernese method and stabilised on 10mg. 8 weeks after my last methadone so yesterday I got my first buvidal 64mg injection.

What is everyone's experience with the slow release formula (buvidal) because I was on 10mg subby strips a day, but 64mg divided by 28 days is about 2.2mg. Im sure that's not how it works because I asked my Dr shouldn't I be on at least the 96mg dose. But he insisted 99% of his patients have loved and been happy with the 64mg dose. 

I have a theory that because the strips are sublingual and contain nalaxone if you take 8mg sublingually you probably only absorb at a maximum 4mg of the drug and that's if you wash youre mouth with warm water and don't drink anything for 20 minutes after. So maybe the palette gets into our blood stream easier.

Also I cannot wait to rely on the chemist and having to take something to feel 'good' everyday because for 4 years my brains tricked me into thinking that getting rid of my withdrawls is some form of euphoria when all it is, is my body and brain balancing out.

Would love to hear back from anyone going through something similar and if you had a good experience or bad one. Best of luck!

I tried many different types of treatment before the doctor felt comfortable with long term opioid treatment. 
About 6 months ago I decided, for a number of reasons, that I would get off medication. 

At this point I went to a treatment center for help.
I was given 40mg of methadone immediately.
This is where the trouble began.
After a week I requested that my dose be lowered to 30mg. The request was denied but my dose was lowered to 38mg instead. 
The following week I did the same thing but my request was again denied. After 2 weeks it was lowered to 37mg. 
This pattern has continued to the point where I am at 34mgs.

I was told today by the clinic that they will no longer lower my dose because I need to reach a “therapeutic dose” before they can titrate me off.
They told me they want to get me to somewhere around 80-100mg before titration can resume.
We got into a lengthy argument because I want to get off and they are saying I need to increase my dose first.
Eventually I was told that I will not be approved any further dose decreases until I get to a “therapeutic dose”. 
———————————————
I do not see the point of this and the whole thing has left a very bad taste in my mouth.
I feel like they only want me to increase my dose so it takes me longer to wean off. 
I will not accept an increase in dosage and if they are refusing to lower my dosage of methadone then I feel like I’m going to have to stop cold turkey. 
I’ve spoken with the program director and she’s taking the side of the counselor so I don’t anticipate any help moving further. 

If I refuse to increase my dose and the only other option is stopping cold turkey…
How long will my withdrawals be?

How severe?

I’ve also considered getting some buying a fuck load of oxys for the next month or 2, and then cold turkeying from that so the withdrawals are shorter instead of the 2-4 week long withdrawal from methadone… or is that really stupid?",3

I wish they would fast track a new (stronger) maintenance med.,"Suboxone was a game changer 10-15 years ago, when you could only find things 10x morphine potency. Buprenorphine (Suboxone) made it relatively easy to quit REAL heroin, dilaudid, oxy, etc. I had almost 5 years ""clean"" with Suboxone between 2010-2015. Unfortunately, I relapsed due to severe pain issues. In a nutshell, I legitimately needed pain meds, buy no doctor would prescribe anything while on Suboxone (despite my sub doctors recommending sort term pain management). 

I tried to find oxy... but being out of the ""loop"" for 5 years, everyone I knew that did oxy switched to heroin. So, I bought some ""heroin"" to treat my pain not knowing that fentanyl was in the supply. I had tried to use heroin on suboxone before, but the bupe ""blocked"" the heroin. With this new ""fentadope"" (fentanyl laced heroin) I broke through no problem. 

I needed to self medicate for about a month while recovering from multiple surgeries... and since I hid my use from my clinic, I continued to get a script of suboxone... which had accumulated into quite a stash. 

I took 2 mgs, 18 hours after my last dose and didn't feel much. So I took 4 more milligrams, and went into severe precipitated withdrawal. It was so bad, I had to score more ""fentadope"" to end the severe pwd. I decided to try again. This time I waited 24 hours. Again, I experienced severe precipitated withdrawal... despite being in fairly severe normal withdrawal. I tried to stick it out tho. 

That night was one of the longest nights of my life. I was sicker than ever. By far some of the worse withdrawal I've ever experienced. Having a 30 day supply of suboxone, I kept taking it. I tool a total of 32 milligrams that night. The suboxone did NOTHING. 

Finally, by morning I was so exhausted that I passed out for an hour or so. When I woke, I was still in severe withdrawal, severe pain, and I had that lack of sleep sickness too. I had a stash of ""comfort"" meds, so I started taking them. First antidiarrheal meds, then clonidine and gabapentin. I managed to sleep through most of that day (day 2). 

I woke still in severe pain and withdrawal. It was evening now, having slept all day. I began to take more suboxone. 8 mgs at a time, for the next few hours. Again, I took a total of 32 mgs. Again... it was like I wasn't taking anything. Around midnight, I took a decent amount of comfort meds, and some Tylenol PM. I did sleep for a few hours, but it wasn't restful. 

Day 3 through day 7, I rinsed and repeated. I went through most of my 30 day supply of suboxone during those 7 days. I kept praying that the suboxone would begin to work. It didn't. 

On the night of day 7, I broke down and bought more ""fentadope"". It took very little to ""break throu"" and I found relief almost instantly. I began to look at other treatment options. Methadone mainly. I called the methadone clinic, and they had sort of a ""show up on Tuesday"" sort of thing. The receptionist said that I needed to be in withdrawal... so I showed up sick. Sat through the whole 4 hour ""induction"" and finally sat down with a doctor. I had some suboxone in my system, and fentanyl. However, because I picked up my suboxone script a few days before... the doc told me she couldn't prescribe methadone at that time. She said to officially quit the suboxone program and come back the next week. 

That week In-between was difficult. I had never tried methadone and I had all sorts of concerns. I kept using fentadope during that week, and whennext Tuesday came along I went back to the methadone clinic. This time I received my first dose. 30 mgs. 

I didn't even feel effects from the methadone. It was like it did nothing. So I continued to use. Over the next 5 days, if I remember correctly, they bumped me up 5 mgs per day. I was up to 60 mgs after that first week... and I had to put in requests for an ""increase"". 10 mgs max per week. 

When I reached 80 mgs of methadone, I began to feel some slight relief. However, it was only for a few hours... and I would be in withdrawal by the end of the night. I kept asking for (and getting) increases until I hit 110 mgs. At which point, I began to get the requests denied. I guess they must've thought that I was stable. I've heard that this clinic rarely goes over 120 mgs. So, I guess I maxed out. 

With the methadone covering me for most of the day... I was able to cut my use down by half. I was in groups and counseling required by the program, and interestingly, the clinic was satisfied with ""decreased use"". Talking to many other patients/clients... I realized that most people were still using.

Methadone wasn't cutting it. For anyone! It was normal  to have a heroin/fentanyl habit AND a newly acquired methadone habit. For years I did both the methadone and fentadope. I was never really able to shake the nightly withdrawal. And as far as the nationally funded health department affiliated methadone clinic I attend... like I said ""decreased use"" is a win for them. People testing positive for opioids is acceptable there. God forbid you do benzos, coke, marijuana, or drink alcohol tho! They'll kick you out for using THOSE drugs.!",4

This is probably the 20th time I’ve tried to quit in the last year from an appx. 500-600mg/day pharmaceutical oxy habit. Been using for the better part of 7 years with the exception of about 3 months after I fell out the one time I came in touch with pressies. Was using about 10 blues/day for most of that but been in the 15+/day range for the last 18 months. Played power 5 football in college and had a bunch of surgeries, which is where this all started. I own a commercial real estate brokerage and can basically get away with knocking down 3-4 blues every couple hours during the day without anyone really knowing. 

Here we are today, roughly 80 hours in, almost heading to bed and I feel decent, almost good…. This entire kick has been completely different than the (no shit) 20+ times I’ve tried to quit historically. The only thing I’ve done different this time is megadosing vitamin C, per the advice of some other folks on here. I’ve been taking about 5,000-6,000mg every 2-4 hours in addition to about 2g of kratom (fully aware I need to be careful), in addition to the standards; l-tyrosine, l-theanine, GABA, magnesium citrate, D’s, B’s, Advil, about 6mg Imodium per day, THC pills, my cartridge and some benzos to sleep. 

If a standard withdrawal is a 9/10 or 10/10 the last 3+ days have been a 2/10. I’ve worked 12 hours days at the office twice (stayed home today just to be careful). Been working out and hitting the sauna everyday. Guess I just wanted to get on here to tell everyone that you can do it! I know I’m still so early in the process, but I’m positive that I’m taking the right steps and doing everything the right way this time around. I’ll keep checking in over the next couple days, you guys really keep me sane and give me hope when I’m going through the worst of it! Would love to chat with whoever - THANK YOU ALL!!!",3

Obviously, a lot of opiate addictions are caused by receiving opiates as a prescription. Additionally, it’s really easy to abuse your prescription drugs. I know that doctors drug test patients to ensure they’re not abusing their prescriptions, but that’s not always the case and it often doesn’t work because you can cheat a drug test.

What if there were electronic pill bottles that were set to release pills to timers so that they don’t allow the user to take out more of the drug than what is needed? 

And they could be built in a way that if the user tried to forcefully open the bottle, it would immediately destroy the contents within (or render them unusable).

I’m not an engineer, I have no idea how to make this device, or even if it’s possible. But I wanted to share just in case anyone else had input :)",6

So my way of staying clean is avoiding using my computer, which is almost disabling to me at the same time because my career is history is one of using computers.

Well two weeks ago, I was doing a relative a favor and dropped them off in another part of town because they don’t have a car.

On my way back from that, I began to feel extremely nauseous despite being sober for 1.5 months. Well, I had to take the nearest exit while puking out the window of my vehicle.

I only find out later this exit is one of the main hubs for drug activity in my city. I pull into the nearest parking spot and a homeless looking guy walks by and sees me. He knows I’m dope sick and asks if I need dope.

Of course I say yes because how could I not in this terrible moment of weakness. I take him somewhere and he gets the dope for me, it all works out.

I got high again and there goes 1.5 months of very slow progress right down the fucking drain.

It’s just so strange to me that this happened and just how easy it was to get dope on the street. I almost took it as a sign from god that I was supposed to relapse, because it just came right to me almost.

How the fuck am I supposed to stay sober when drugs literally just appear right in my moments of greatest weakness?

I get that this probably happens to a lot of people but that was one of the only times in my life the universe made it easy for my to get opiates. I just needed to rant.",3

Ever since I got out, I’ve been struggling more than ever before with suicidal thoughts and ideation. Before I ever started using opiates, I already wanted to die and was suicidal and I just don’t see things getting any better at all.

This is really the first time in years that I have really put in any effort to stay sober but I still feel like I’m not doing it for myself because I basically have someone with me most of the time who makes sure I don’t do anything.

If I really wanted to, I could get something, but it would certainly be “premeditated” and the thought of letting this person down yet again or getting caught in the act is utterly terrifying.

Two weeks ago, I relapsed after being clean for 1.5 months. This persons reaction when they found out was very traumatizing to me, despite myself having a small high at the time. They grabbed a knife and started threatening to kill themselves. I managed to get the knife from them but then they smacked me in the head repeatedly about 4 or 5 times. While I did sit there and take it, it was probably the scariest thing that has ever happened to me.

Now I’m a few days clean again. I was already struggling with my anxiety and depression before. Now I have things that I “need” to do, like get a job, I guess. I was denied unemployment because I was “fired”, but I thought that was the point of unemployment. I applied for things like disability, food stamps, Medicare online but I haven’t heard back from any of them, website hasn’t updated.

The thing is, I’m scared to answer my phone. I’m scared to do anything that could be labeled as being productive really. I really just want to kill myself but I don’t want to hurt my family. I’m in more pain than ever before. Anxiety on a level that is straight up fight or flight mode nearly 24/7 except 3 hours of sleep. Methadone seems like the right option but I hear conflicting things. I’m off of benzos now which I had been on for a decade, because they wouldn’t give them to me in the hospital and now my old doctor is retired too.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. What to say. I don’t care. I might end up homeless or dead. I don’t care. Right now in my mind, the best thing I think I could do for myself and everyone else is to get enough fent or heroin to overdose and die for sure, but I’m also scared to die because what if I’m wrong and there actually is a God and I go to hell. The thing is, it is actually within my capability to do just that if I managed to muster up the energy for one final act in this comedic tragedy of a play, and I could do it without a single soul knowing. It’s all I can think about, it’s always in the back of my mind. I feel like I’m a shadow of my former self now. But if I already was doing bad before opiates, what is the point in trying to return to that state.

Today I said fuck God and fuck this masochistic world that sets people up for failure. I said some terrible things but I felt I had to say them because all of this anger and rage has no outlet.",5

I definitely feel... lost. Just lost. Not in a fiending way. More like I wasted my youth being strung out. The ""now what?"" I had a passion, a niche, that is a really healthy outlet, but the places I go and the scene of it is just... so toxic for people in recovery. Every time, multiple people coming up and asking if I want this or that. There is no spot for me in that. I already know because it led to a relapse in the past- coke one night, then straight to the dope. Lost for years. 

I don't want to be caught in that again. Everyone feels stable until the shit is right in your face, you know? That is the real test and I have failed over and over in the past. I know I have a different mindset than I did back then, but it still scares me. I enjoy the music, the people, the overall vibe. I get to burn off some steam, meet new people. I don't have that now.

I want to set myself up for success and continue to keep those barriers up against any possible situation where I'd be near substances.

I know they do some kind of sub taper at the detox and I’m scared I’m gonna take it to early and screw myself into pwds. Guess I have to just stay strong and hold out until I can’t take it anymore idk. I also wish I didn’t have to share a room w someone, Im gonna be puking w stomach issues sneezing, rls, and someone is gonna be witnessing this and also in detox as well in the same room? How is that a good thing? I am going to a decent place thru my insurance thank god. Guess I’m just looking for some encouragement and maybe some detox experiences. I’m detoxing from poppy tea. Have been on it for years and years. I do about a lb a day. Wds get bad at the 24H and up mark. I’m so so scared. I just keep imagining myself on night 2 absolutely dying crying missing my home and family. Please send me good thoughts and prayers thank you!",4

What have I noticed though?

I’ve noticed that all last year and the year before I would upload content to the heroin subreddit. And there was only 21,000 at the time. Now there is almost 50 k ( doubled in a year) but yet its slower than ever.

4 posts in 9 hours? I mean shit me and my two Reddit acquaintances would have that covered by ourselves. What I’m saying is, where is everyone? Twice as many subs/ half the amount of posts. This one dude bluexanzcan passed away he used to drop content. All I’m saying is be careful. It’s scary out here.

Even things in here seem slower than normal. Hope everyone is ok.",21

Everyone was really helpful, the pharmacy staff were really nice actually and I feel like they really wanted me to succeed. I am probably not their typical customer for daily pickups, made evident as when it came to pay for it they were shocked that I had to pay and that I worked.

Either way, this is the start of the next chapter of my life. Bring it on.",5

I've been on oxycodone for maybe 10 years. They were prescribed first for daily headaches, then I got neck pain, then back pain, then back surgery, etc...anyway, surgery was 6 years ago, and I've been trying to quit for a while now. I used to be on 400 mg a day, I'm in 45 mg now, but I seem to be stuck here for months now. I can't get past those 4.5 pills a day. My doc wants to start cutting down again in the spring. Has anyone been on it for so long and managed to quit? It feels like I will be never rid of that stuff.",3
2022-02-01 06:20:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/shsnp6/last_wd_symptomsevere_insomnia/,Last WD Symptom-Severe Insomnia,"Quick background: Started smoking blues maybe like a year & a half ago, they became super hard to find & ultimately 100% not available so had to jump on black. All the while never consuming anything crazy, it was more so done to stay well. So for blues it was 3 a day split between two people, heroin was a half gram split between two people, smoked never slammed (w/ a dabber cause fuck foil). 

On Jan 24th (Monday) I began my little at home detox process which technically started the night before. I drank 1-2 cups of Kratom (mixed in hot water) which I only drank for like 3-4 days. Ok, my detox was FUCKING PEACHES compared to what I was expecting. I slept majority of the day/night in the beginning. Kratom must’ve handled any other symptom which was nothing more than my usual anxiety & some body aches. Wednesday night I went to ER, was given 0.5 of Suboxone & haven’t had a physical withdrawal symptom since! Except that I can’t fucking sleep. This is the 8th night of restlessness, which makes what like 7 days. Earlier i finally fell asleep but that was only for 4hours. That little bit helped me a lot but before that I was loosing my fucking mind. I’m still very unsettled with this. 4 hours of sleep in the last 7-8 days is not okay. Came with a number of issues of course. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or advice? The advise line for Kaiser is fucking useless.",3
