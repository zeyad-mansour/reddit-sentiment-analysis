I knew he had used before but I was under the impression it was on occasional thing and didn’t know he had been using recently. He told me last week after being prescribed more pills for a back injury a while back he had been going hard.

Now that I think back on it I’m wondering if the symptoms have been there for years. He has been super flaky, rarely if ever returning calls or texts, and over emotional. When he would call he would either be giddy with excitement or good news or be going through some calamity that was throwing him into depression. Our friendship has suffered due to this and we probably haven’t been close due to his behavior for years now. 

He told me last week when we spoke he was quitting cold turkey and was on day 2 and feeling like crap. My question is what can I expect from him now? It sounds like he shared his struggle with his family so I know he has their support. I reached out to him in the last couple of days through text and phone and received no response. Can I expect to get my old friend back that I love? I’d like to be there for him but obviously that’s hard when he won’t respond to any communication. I’m cool with giving him space as well if that’s what he needs. Just looking for any input from those who have been in his or my shoes.

I cant get off cold turkey because i still have to go to work. What supplements will help me ease the withdrawal? I know passionflower extract, valerian root, and Xanax can help with the discomfort, but it’s the sweating and shaking that are hard to go through while I’m at work. Mentally this is all very difficult. I feel trapped by this and I just want my life back. I was taking 30mg a day of prescribed oxycodone when my doctor cut me off, showing me a letter from the governor citing That I could no longer be prescribed pain meds. So I went to pain management and they told me they couldn’t give me anything until I got spinal injections. But that left me with still a dependence that I couldn’t function without the opiates. I went to another pain management and they shut me down too. So I bought some from a lady who claimed they were from her grandma and even had the pill bottle. They were fake... the fake blues that are going around. I got dependent on those and my tolerance climbed. Now I’m trapped in this life where I don’t even use them to get high, just to feel normal. I don’t want this anymore and need a way to come off as comfortably as possible. I still have to work and function in my day to day life. I’m weaning as hard as I can.

I have detoxed with various strategies before but always on my own and with different outcomes to say the least. Kratom has been a lifesavier but the key with that option is to quit kratom ASAP aslo. Or otherwise you are down in the shit agaim.

Enough blabbering and down to my concern, I took my last line of heroin (never touched a needle in my life thank god) at around 10 in the morning, it was like 0.3g. But I have hade some real bad shit lately and started to feel the wd's really early, and my bup connection was offline so I went to buy tramadol and some xanor instead. But then I got in contact with the bup guy and sorted it.

My biggest concern is if I take some of the bup now could I end up in one of those horror withdrawals you heard about? The main reason I worrying is that the tramadol gonna fuck it up somehow...

I am a 26m and have had an opiate issue for about 8 years now. I have had a few periods of sobriety and have been to probably 10 different treatment centers total. I will tell you this much I feel stuck.
I am in a terrible position right now.
I honestly would go back to treatment if I could.
I have been using pressed blues for about 2-3 months now. It got up to about 5 or 6 a day but I have not taken anything to get high since Friday.
Let me tell you my situation: 
So I live in south Florida and have my own condo and a puppy. I also have a great support group with NA there. I have a sponsor and have had much experience in the program before and believe that it is really the answer. I am very honest with my NA supports and they know I have been struggling. I took a few days off work and went into a detox 2 weeks ago for a few days however I used the day after I got out. 
I am also very honest with my mother, I told her what is going on and she advised me to come visit her for thanksgiving and stay past Christmas (she lives in a northern state). I took her up on the offer thinking I could go up there for a month and detox again and just law low and save money and get maybe 30 days clean and then go back to Florida with my mind clearer. This is a lot harder than it sounds.
I am a junkie man, I picked up some fent from one of my old connects on my way to my moms and wrecked my car less than a mile from her house. So now I totaled my car and have no transportation. Thank god I’m working remotely And am able to work from my moms and continue to make money. 
I brought 2 8mg subutex pills with me up here and have broken them into 2mg pieces. 
Yesterday I took 6 mg total, 2 in the morning, 2 afternoon 2 at night. Today I have taken one does and plan to only take one more tonight. Tomorrow I plan to do the same and the. Go down to 2 mg a day for 2 days. 
Idk man I just feel very lost and hopeless, my mom is pissed at me bc the situation. I brought my dog with me here and he is crazy and I barely have energy to take care of him. I feel like dog shit and am depressed. I feel like life really isn’t worth it at this point because I have been doing this shit off and on for so long now.

I hope that everyone is doing well and is smiling. 
What a year 2020 has been eh... I for one will be glad to see the back of it... roll on 2021 
I have been trying to get clean off heroin for the last 2 years. I have been on the shite 15or so years, I have methadone to help but the problem I have is that I always relapse sometimes after a few weeks sometimes days. I use for a bit then start over again to try again. I just can’t seem to stop and I really want to. It seems like I’m just going round and round in circles. I have tried literally everything over the years but 2 years ago I started going to CA meetings and since that day I have known that within those rooms lies the answer. When I go to the meetings and do all the stuff I’m supposed to it works, I stay clean but I can’t keep it up. I always get pulled back to using. I can see that lots of my fellows at CA are clean and follow the program and it works. I just can’t seem to do it myself, it’s like I have a inbuilt reaction to buck against it. I know that if and when I follow the program it works but for some unknown reason I can’t stick to it. 
What I was wondering was what was the thing ghat finally made you all do it - get clean for good? Did any of you have what I’m going through ? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks to all in advance, this forum is amazing it’s helped me through some dark times. I’ve not been much of a poster more a reader but I gotta start somewhere

I‘ve been on and off opiates for around 2 years. I wasn’t a daily user neither did I use dope at first. Well around april this year shit started to get really bad and soon I was using daily and also copped dope when pills weren’t available. I knew I should stop it before it really gets out of hand. My doc prescribed me naltrexone a long time ago but I’ve never used them cuz I didn’t wanna get off opiates. Then around late august i started taking them cuz I really wanted to get sober at that point.

So everything went fine I had terrible cravings but I could cope with them. I knew i don’t have strong will power so I told my mom she should check on me everyday when I take the naltrexone. I was romanticizing opiates a lot, so I bought a stash of oxy thinking I can’t take them anyway. Stupid move I know. Well my mom isn’t really that keen about checking nowadays and somehow my dumb ass skipped 4 doses and I relapsed. I just used twice and I don’t know what to do now. I really wanna use and prolly will use today again but I really really DONT wanna go down that path again. I just started getting better and my parents and gf who are very supportive were so happy. I feel like it’s over if I pick up again. Do I have to wait 7 days now if I wanna get back on the naltrexone? Problem is my mom might check on me again taking the medication and then I’m pretty fucked. I hope I can turn this around somehow. I just wasted 3 months of hard work and suffering.

there is so much that i could write that it is honestly overwhelming to even consider where to begin. but then, what can i say that hasn’t already been said? for years my life was constant pain and misery. i was trapped inside of a nightmare with no idea of how to get out, waking up every morning in tears at the thought of having to face another 24 hours of physical, mental, and emotional agony. i was a husk of myself, unable to think or care about anything besides satisfying my addiction and those brief moments of relief that using provided. i used and i used even as i blacked out and lost consciousness and struggled to breathe, and i couldn’t bring myself to care about whether or not i died so long as i could get high just one more time. i have never felt such darkness, such hopelessness and despair and desperation, and no amount of words could possibly do justice to the full extent of how destructive and all-consuming my fentanyl addiction was. 

but today i am alive. not only alive, but happy and thriving. in these last 14 months i have done everything within my power to make a better life for myself. i have completed intensive therapy and rehab, i have graduated college, i got a job that i find truly enjoyable and fulfilling. i have been slowly rediscovering my passions and interests and working with doctors and counselors to keep my physical and mental health on track. my friendships have flourished and i am surrounded by love that i can finally feel and reciprocate fully.

Now I'm down to 150mg, and I'm going to have to do 100mg for only three days, and then 50mg for four days.

I’ve got a week off next week so I’m going to stop then. It’s madness because the amount of taking is so small that I doubt it’ll even cause any physical issues.

I’m having issues with cravings though to take more than my taper, I’m feeling depressed and I keep feeling like a few pills will make me feel great again.  Are there any techniques you guys use to stop cravings? I haven’t cracked yet, but they only started after I dropped the dose this week. I think they started because I can no longer feel my dose, I got a extremely mild buzz last week, but with my dose now I don’t feel anything.

I would love to know your experiences about this. I recovered from oxy addiction. Im M26 and loved to be high on oxys. I hated nodding, so I never was completely numbed. I love the energetic dizz this drug gave me. I had so much energy, loved to do stuff on it. Walking through a park etc. 

In the spring of this year I met my first love. I can excactly remember that day I was on the beach with her. Totally high on oxys and love endorphines. This was one of my most beautiful days. The combination of both felt like paradise. The dates also were very energetic, I was always in a good mood. I dont know if this helped me falling in love with her.

Now there are people saying falling in love sober is much more intense and better. But Im kinda worried that new dates will be boring without the rush of opiates. That the fact she was my first love (who left me very soon after and led me into deep depression what made addiction even worse for a short time) and the fact, that I will always remember those days as very energetic and good mooded will make my new dates look like cold winterdays.

I know Reddit is quite to the point and usually has answers from people with first hand experience.

The back story is I was taking Tramadol daily to battle ADHD. For some reason, tramadol (apart from feeling awesome) created a feeling of total concentration inside of my head. I could work for 18 hours, sleep for 6 and then repeat. Day after day after day.

Eventually I realised that this was an egregious cycle, especially on days when I would take in excess of a gram of it.
I cut it out cold turkey, and trust me I suffered some horrible withdrawals, the worst being NBS (narcotic bowel syndrome).

I realise I suffered the withdrawal symptoms because my body had become DEPENDENT on the drug and I had to adjust to not having it in my system.

Mentally, I don’t think I was addicted. I made the decision to stop myself without any pressure of anyone else.
I was the same with cigarettes. I smoked for 5 years and then stopped cold turkey.

My question is, if I decided to take tramadol again, to get into that headspace of complete focus and only took it for up to a week, would my body become instantly dependent on the drug again due to my prior abuse of it?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5681482}"

You deserve an update.,"Please check my post history. Immediately after leaving work after getting fired I drove 5 minutes up the hwy, pulled over and made that post. Mostly to stop myself from ploughing my car into a tree. 

The last year has been the worst yet. ""sobriety"" doesn't fix everything. I'm constantly taunting myself with the old saying ""wherever you go, there you are"". I initially jumped to palliative care after a pretty long (and enjoyable) run in acute Psych. Years ago, 5 to be exact, we had a patient hang themselves by their pants in the 5 minute gap they grabbed between seeing us and then us rounding on them. The aftermath has been horrific. 

Most horrific is the Australian registration board dragging this cluster fuck out for a further 3 years  post the coroners inquest. I worked a few casual shifts here and there. First shift, instead of stealing opiates I stole benzos. Nursing and me just don't mix at the moment. And that makes me said because I genuinely love it. 

I remember the PAWS plus trying to care for my child plus not completely alienate my spouse lead me to gradually titrating up a huge lope tolerance. I'm out of excuses. Lope is 10 times worse for a fraction of the high. It. Fucks. You. Up. 

My body odor is godawful, I feel completely fucking out of it constantly, I shake, I'm pretty sure I've seized whilst alone. During the upswing of my opiate use I had 3 serious car accidents in a year. Now I'm back to actively wanting to die. 

My husband has had enough. And I'm going to lose my child if I'm not careful. So day 6 AGAIN. Pregabalin and valium are helping. I gave the Valium to my mum. She's the most trustworthy person I know and there's no way I'll get any extra out of her. 

I feel tired, like I could sleep for 24 hours. But I felt like that anyway so meh. Least I feel normal walking around and have the energy to get up and have breakfast with my kid. 

I'll try to check in regularly.

We have two kids, a girl who just turned 2 and a 9 month old. It’s really important to both of us that we try our hardest to make things work before going our separate ways... but something happened and I don’t know how to even like accept that it really happened let alone get past it so that I can move on from this. I fear I will be suspicious, worried, scared, unsure, etc for who knows how long. I have to get through this and past it for the sake of my relationship and my kids because I can’t be in a relationship of constant suspicion, distrust and stress. 

Neither of us have expressed that we wanted to use, that we were at risk of using or anything of that nature. I would have bet my life that his drug use was part of his past and that he had closed that chapter and moved forward. I mistakenly projected my feelings regarding my level of risk to relapse as I have put that part of my life in the past and I worked really hard to do that. 

Anyways, the other day I found supplies in our closet. He tried to say they were old but the manufacture date on the bag was August 2020. He finally admitted that he hasn’t been taking his ritalin orally, if you catch my drift. 

I never tried it, I was never around it, I never knew anyone who did it and I think because of that, I’m not desensitized to it and for some reason it broke my fucking heart.

I feel like I am so stupid for not noticing, for not throwing away one that I found when we were unpacking his apartment that he had before going to rehab years prior. I didn’t want to just put it in the trash so I was going to dispose of it properly and my dumbass just didn’t think about it again.

I feel so naive and just stupid for not noticing anything. I don’t judge him or anyone else for doing that so it’s not like I look down on him or think less of him. 

I’m just blindsided. We talked about this when we first started dating and I told him that I would leave him for this because I wont let our kids be around it. I feel like he made so many decisions and he decided to risk his relationship, his kids and our life together every time he did it or went to get what he needed for it. 

Please be kind to me. I know there’s people on here that have done it or are doing it and I really don’t have an issue with it or think negatively of it at all. I’m an addict too like we are all on here for the same reasons... this is a place where I know I can go and be 100% honest about what’s going on and I know that people here would understand and could give me perspective on my situation. 

I’m all over the place. I’m not coping well. I find myself comforting him. I appreciate any insight... I need to find a way to understand why he did what he did and ways to trust him again and not be scared all the time that he could be doing it again. Why is this such a dealbreaker for me?

I hope this is allowed here... I haven’t told anyone because as of a week or so ago, we’re going through custody regarding his son and if this got out he would be fucked. I feel like all of you have an understanding and insight that most of the people on r/relationships don’t have.

Surgery

I love you

Started with little flirtations

I think about you every second I’m awake Feel

pain when your away and not mine, inside me

Dream of your cloudy warm bliss

Warm and whole

Warm white Milk in a bowl

Milk of the poppy

My ailments disappear

I see fucking clear

Love, you leave me

And I imagine I’m warm again and perfect

But my throat is dry again, this damn cold

choking mountain air

Dry cold high climate, it ain’t fair

And news says there’s a fire some miles to the

west in those two unfathomable mountains,

so the fires smoke is adding, and I cannot take it

I’ve lived here my whole life

Baby, Kid, teen, mom, wife

And of course a student laborer and taxpayer

Which wore down my mind and body in some ways

But at least it allowed me to take you out

And distract me when your away

I’m told it’s all I’m good for

Life’s a bore

I thought I’d be famous and live in Cali like we all did see the 90s

Take snaps, be in a film, party

But she got old, older

She’s me

I’ve still got beauty

To help me seduce you

I’ll use sexiness too

I’ll use my God given tools

I’ll even play by your rules

Find loops when I can

You’ll be my man

You made it alright to accept I would and will die here

Seeing us all age and die but I look west and

have hope the mountains can defeat time

Hell they used time to get so big unfathomable and beautiful

Yet I’ve learned eventually they will fail like our bodies

I love how you make my body feel and it’s alright even if i don’t cum

My pain from them leaving

They died, both my dads

One moment we laugh together and talk shit,

the next they were shoving tubes down your throat, piercing your lungs

Or you wouldn’t eat anymore or even drink and you comically threw the coffee mom made for you, that you once loved, in the plants

The plants would touch death too when you did, you’d take em with you Our last name indicates we cause trouble and pain, pain and trouble should fear us

But u weren’t afraid of death then

You still wanted to feel love and bliss before the eternal release

Before I’m told, eternal peace

But you didn’t fear it, you had enough of the physical world

It’s alright u had fun

My Pain from her leaving

She died My sister But she hadn’t known she would soon, 40s

she died unexpectedly making food

They said wrapped in loves anti embrace aka suboxone

Alcohol intensified her last moments

We think she was afraid as she tried to make ramen noodles in a fit of panic and eat

They found boxes and boxes of suboxone

Stored up

We are simple creatures in the end

We find pleasure in sustenance

Why Do we feel these levels of pain

Why once I had you I can’t go back to being the same

Slave to you

Sex slave, any type of slave

They’re gone now anyway

We all know we can’t stay

Look at those mountains

Shaped by time

Time cuts us

Like surgery

Like surgery, when we met

I fell, but I ran, gave a great effort and chase

Time and natures violence kills us

I try not to make a fuss

Lord knows when I’m with you I don’t have to

Only time I never feel blue

I told him to cum inside of me because I felt relief

Or I made myself cum, all night and evening

I’m still fertile you know

What will I do when I’m not beautiful and fertile?

How will I seduce you

How will I seduce to get you here

He’s indifferent after he cums, he says because it makes him sensitive

What would I know about that stuff

I take it as he’s cold

You never do that to me

You’ll stay here as long as I can buy your time

Yes you leave too

But you won’t abruptly leave

And if I have the right address getting what u want like he

We can just be

Heck you’ve even stayed with me hours at a

time

I’ve gotta find a way to make u always mine

Or I’ll die or there’s nothing worth it

I’m told those emotions would die,

Might take a month or two

Dad

I know you said you were proud of me in a vivid

dream you got through to me

Only for a little, new spirit you were

I was laid off

I’m dreaming of you again and called you, asked you to come over

He won’t mind, my other love

He loves you too

You also take away his blue

We both have mistress and mistresses

What can one expect, we have been together since high school

Anyone who doesn’t is a fool

Of course we still love each-other

But babe you know your something different and nothing can come close

I feel I can be me with you

You just make me better

I don’t have to act with you

Please don’t ignore or stay away

I got vomit inducing drink thinking about you

The thought of never being in your warm embrace again

The thought made me cry in pain

I was terrified

You know what you are Confident

Why would you want me

You get offers all the time

I can only ever have a small piece of you

I want more but I know it would kill me

This is the death I choose

Not now, I have to raise my boys into adulthood

I have some bucket list items

See a few big cities and cutting landscapes

maybe even like the one to the west

But I want to come back and die in your embrace

I wonder if the afterlife is like being in your embrace forever

If that’s the case sign me up

You said today you’ll allow me to have you I’m awaiting eagerly baby

Don’t reject me like those times before

Please.., you know I’d do anything for you

Help me live

Help me breathe

Surgery time again?

I have to kill you

this blood from my ancestors

Warrior

For it is you or I

And I would like to say you have underestimated me

you have one less soul

Lord help me I'm weak

Update: day 3 he’s weak and went out and bought some percs claims it’s so we can have dinner with his family, it’s our daughters first thanksgiving, I said let’s just stay home til he’s feeling better instead he asks his brother for money and now I’m pissed because I could’ve lost my job the other day trying to be there for him during this time I’m the only one working 

Update 2: so now that the heroin is out of his system with the help of percs (his idea)and xannax, he’s trying to now taper down from the percs, which he said would be easier, he also claims that this is the last time he’ll put me through this, so we’ll see, I’m hopeful but I know what he’s dealing with isn’t easy and he doesn’t have much will power but I’m gonna pray and support him",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4422289}"

So I haven't really shared this yet, but I think it's time. This past Friday I had my 17 week OB appointment, with the doctor who specializes in women with substance use issues. When she asked me how I was doing, I kinda broke down and told her, truthfully, that I've been craving heroin very badly and the naltrexone wasn't helping much at all. She suggested I get on suboxone - that's what she does after all, most of her patients are on suboxone or methadone. We talked about the pros and cons, and I decided that maybe it's the smartest and safest thing to do right now. Why wait for a relapse, right? 

She prescribed me enough for 16mg per day, but told me that I could take whatever dose I was comfortable with, as long as I split it into two doses every day twelve hours apart (because pregnancy speeds up metabolism). I decided to start out at 4mg, so 2mg twice a day. Because I wasn't opiate dependent when I started taking them, I've been having some side effects like drowsiness, itching, headaches, and irritability. But I have noticed that my mood is a hell of a lot more stable than it was before. It kinda sucks that I don't have a lot of guidance as far as what dose to take. But I guess I'll figure it out eventually.

Thanks for letting me share on that, if you made it this far. I feel like a failure for going back on suboxone, but other people in my life (doctors, psych doc, my husband and some friends) think I'm doing the right thing and are proud of me. Idk. I guess I'm just sad about it.

SNRI or Kratom?,"For all those who have been able to quit tramadol, how have they done it? cold turkey? tappering? with kratom? with antidepressants? with loperamide? pregabalin and maybe?

I've been addicted to tramadol for two years and since May of this year I'e been taking huge doses **(1200-2000 mg every day)** and when my shipments are delayin' or there's no stock on the pharmacy, I fall into depression and extreme fatigue. I lie in bed, doing nothing, crying and wanting my dose of tramadol.

 I think I can leave it cold turkey but not only would it be dangerous but it always or almost always results in relapsing back to the abused substance. Until now I've not been able to do a tapper and it always ended up taking huge doses and my daily purpose is to get high. 

I have a crazy theory that tramadol being part SNRI, maybe I could use Venlfaxine (Effexor), since they are structurally very similar. And thus avoid the worst or most annoying symptom when leaving the tramadol depression, what do you think?

Or should I just do the most popular thing is to start taking kratom (not cheap though, huh?

Which theory do you think works best?

P.S. I have been taking venlafaxine years ago for about 10 months, because of a depression and it worked wonders. No side effects, I left it cold turkey, no WD.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43658942}"

He is almost 35 years old and still lives at home and has no career (at one point, he was an engineer doing pretty well).  Basically at this point he is a total manchild and lives, acts and thinks like a 12 year old kid.  I know for a fact he does 2 heroin needles a day and has for over 5 years.  My parents are approaching retirement age and this doesn't seem to bother them whatsoever. They just think it's not that bad of an addiction and that he will snap out of it one day and move on with his life....  Even though, he keeps fucking up and getting in trouble with the law and about every 6 months completely wrecks a vehicle.  My parents COULD send him to a rehab easily as they have a very large nest egg but they refuse to because they think it wont work based on friends of theirs that said it didnt work for them.   Basically -- it's a dead end conversation every time its brought up with them and they dont wanna hear it.

While I have already wrote him off long ago, I just can't get this out of my head how braindead my family is.   Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do. It would be very much appreciated. I have tried showing my parents horror stories and movies/news articles of people dying and overdosing, nothing seems to phase them. They just shrug their shoulders and say its his choice what he wants to do with his life.  Yet every time he gets in trouble they bail him out.  To date I know for a fact they have spent at least 150K between paying for totally wrecked cars (and someone else's vehicle and medical because he didn't have auto insurance), lawyers, fines, etc. Not to mention they cover his monthly credit card bills that are 2-3K easily (which i know is for heroin - he venmo's his dealers).   Otherwise he would've went to jail for a few years which i know he probably needs.   I just don't get it...and I feel it's never going to end.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76833445}"

The last 7 health issues have intensified in the last 2-3 years. Oh and when my iron is low (in October I was hospitalised with HB of 20) I can’t breath and my whole body swells resulting in severe pitting oedema including my face. 
I think that’s it. 
So when I was in hospital recently in October, I was told I was close to cardiac arrest and had to be escorted to the bathroom for fear of me collapsing, even though I was at work the same day an ambulance was called. I went cold turkey in hospital off codeine (I moved to the uk so they had no knowledge of my previous medical history) and managed to make it a whole 2 days after returning home before I relapsed again. Pretty much a little over a month has gone by and the blood transfusions and iron infusions I was given have started to “wear” off again and I’m swelling, am pale and finding myself lacking breathe again. I’m still taking up to 120 tablets a day now. I just don’t know what to do, every time I fall i get more severe symptoms but my god dam body just. Keeps. Going!  I know I will never beat codeine, I’ve done the replacement therapy for it, cold  Turkey you name it, and I’m fine with death when it finally comes, I’m not a talented person, I’m not gifted, I’m not brainy, I don’t hold a life changing job, or one that matters really so the loss to society will be exceptionally minimal if not 0. But it’s just getting to that point, everyday is agony, everyday is tiring, I don’t want to be around people. Has/does anyone feel like this? Has/does anyone else had/have the same health issues from their addiction? Is This happening to anyone else? 
Don’t get me started on the financial impact of this as well! I got paid a week ago, and now I’m flat broke, I get paid monthly so I have 3 weeks to scrape by. Urrrgh. It’s a bit of a shit existence. My life revolves around codeine, my whole day and how is goes relies on it.

i am new to Reddit and of course then this group. Looking for some advice.

in November I had a recurrence of some chronic facial pains. From Nov 3rd to Nov 15 I took 10 5mg Vicodin pills total over that stretch.  On Nov 16 I switched over to Percocet 5mg pills and through Nov 22 I had a total of 19 taken of the Percocet.

Today when I thought things were better I decided to stop taking the Percoset and see how the pain was.  I then experienced withdrawal systems.  I took one to stop the withdrawal.

The pain is better and I would like to “get off” the Percocet.

As I am not a long time user can I do a quick tapering off.  Other suggestions?

This is all new to me even though I am 66.

in the past have only used opioids for a few days avoiding this.

I made my way to my grandmother’s house in Ensenada, Mexico to try to literally get away from drugs. The danger and extremity of the drug scene and me not knowing my way around there discouraged me from even considering going out and looking to score. Unfortunately my disease found a way around and I quickly found myself in the local Farmacias buying boxes of tramadol. Long story short, within a week of me getting to Mexico, I was in a 6 month rehab against my will due to my grandma refusing to put up with my pill popping. What followed was the most difficult experience of my life as being locked up in a tiny Mexican private run rehab center without knowing when you’re getting out is no joke. Oddly enough, though, while in there I had the strongest desire to get clean that I ever felt in my life. Looking back I probably only wanted to “recover” so the psychologist and the directors could tell my family who were the only ones with the power to “sign me out” that I was ready to leave. Regardless, I felt I was making leaps and bounds recognizing what drove me to use, how to practice the 12 steps to develop a love for life that would surely prevent me from slipping back into my daily depression that often caused me to use. I was soon a darling of the center, used as an example of someone that “let himself be guided” and was told I was probably one of the few that would stay clean on the outside. I felt positive and optimistic like never before. Then I was released 3 days ago. Once I got back home, the sadness and reality of my situation hit and I got depressed. Instantly, I felt the need to use. Anything. I talked with my brother that night and the cravings went away. I slept all day yesterday, only waking up to eat. Today I woke up feeling life is meaningless without drugs, feeling an extreme apathy as ridiculous as that sounds.

It’s frustrating because I thought once I got out I would feel passionate for life once again and enjoy all the things I missed out on. It feels like the opposite is true. I feel discouraged and want to use just so I could have motivation to at least clean up around the house. I feel terrible just laying around while my parents take care of responsibilities. I’m seriously considering asking my mom to get me kratom as I don’t have any money myself but I would be crushed if she took it as me just trying to go back to my old ways after I painted such a beautiful picture of how life would be when I got out. I’m also afraid of “starting off slow” and thinking I can control my addiction by just taking kratom or only drinking beer knowing it’ll eventually lead me to heroin and fent. It’s just crazy how different I feel back than I imagined I would feel back when I was locked up in the center. I feel that no one’s words of advice can really make a difference in how I’m feeling as I can feel this problem being physical and almost chemical. My body just feels weak and drained.

I'll start on a basis of, this is no other than an opinion of mine living through opiate addiction. 

37 3 kids, wife, doing ok. Why should I have any issues? My kids have autism. When they were small it was really hard. Now they are doing well at mainstream school, friends and we have put a lot I to them and still do. However when it was tough was when I started using opioids. We are through the worst and anyone looking in would say I've got a good life but a couple of weeks ago I was still using and even now would love to take some. 

My issue is depression, I don't know where it comes from but and I doubt I can ever get rid of it, but I have learned I can mask it. My goal now is to get that mask to become who I am. Physical exercise, small daily positive goals. Making lists and ticking them off, no matter how small. Getting good sleep. Focusing on experience over comparison. Focusing on my kids and their well being as well as my wife. Having a purpose. 

Point being that, there's no drugs or routine or detox that will really help me not want to take opioids anymore. I've been on and off for a couple of years now and feel I have enough experience now that when I focus on positive and physical activities as a priority, I don't want to use. When I have nothing to do and get lost in my own thoughts, that's when opioids come back into the routine. Then you are on them and doing nothing is ok, it's good, you get into a scarry routine of now relying on these drugs to make nothing or normal seem good. 

I know there's a lot of people in a much harder time than me but from my own experience, the physical withdrawal symptoms are really over-rated in here Nd going through them is pissing in the wind without. Proper plan of action of how to survive. Day without opioids. All that is doing is relying on willpower which can never last. You need to remove the want which means, from my experience, rebuilding your entire routine. Make your day about other people. Make you day about challenge. Make your day about accomplishing tasks. 

I hope this is a help for anyone and welcome any additional advice for how we can all deal with this.

I'm 22 and have seen psychiatrists for 17 or 18 of those years and never once had the right diagnosis (aspergers is another possibility or I may have both).

I got thru college with a Master's in Applied Ethics and have these grandiose goals about helping to save the world from destruction or a slow decline into a Warhammer 40k-esque period of permanent stagnation and devolution into a grim darkness from which we never recover and in which humanity never comes close to the shining potential I know it can have...

If that sounds like bragging, please keep in mind that my main point with this post is to point out that I actually think I'm the DUMBEST motherfucker out there, because I KNOW how easily I could excel and get many of the things I want out of life, and yet I continue to put myself further into the hole - financially, emotionally, developmentally, relationally (to other people), physically, ethically - chasing a dragon that I don't even like as much as weed. Even if I decided to fall down the rabbit hole with hedonism as my main and only motivating desire, I'm not even doing that as nearly as well as I could be, is what I'm saying.

Its been quite the trivial adventure, nothing short of really hopeless times and trying to survive spiritually. The hope to live is a gift, without hope to live is a dark, empty, void and many people die. I was defeated, I was gone, I knew I lost, death was accepted at any given day. I didn't know when I would die but I knew I could die any day and that reality played in my head for years. I was sad that I had succumbed to something I had associated with weakness, addiction. That was war, a long war and I'm tired of fighting. I have a new and respectful nature of what entails addiction. Addiction needs to be respected and talked about more as it is quite complex and destroys human life. 

Escaping reality will stunt growth and maturity. The best thing I like about being sober is acting consistently in a stable emotional mind set. Its freeing and there's some inner peace to that vibe. I have the ability to make choices today, in the problem the drug was my master and it ran my thoughts 24/7 for a decade. Nothing can replace the gratitude I have for stopping the big tornado (Mach fuckin 7000, God damn) and take responsibility to clean up some wreckage.

We are all here because our lives became increasingly unmanageable as we continued to use drugs, because we operate with a disease that desperately requires preventative maintenance for our continued, productive existence.

Someone who can take drugs without ruining their life is not a threat to your sobriety, because we know so intimately we are not that person.

I been lurking reddit for a long time and thought id actually start posting here to see if it actually helps or not. Tbh idk if im breaking the rules here by creating a post like this right off the bat, and if i am im sorry n just lmk i ll delete it. This might be long so if you make it to the end thanks for listening,  So a lil backstory : 

Im 26 bout be to be 27 soon and i've been addicted to opiates for 6 years now. I might have used some pills here and there when i was younger but daily use didnt happen until i hit the age of 21. A gram a day or more if possible at the least, smoked, is how i would use it but never picked up the needle. It cost me my college life, grades, friends, D1 wrestling career, and even a snowboarding career. I would like to add that I suffer from crippling anxiety that I was too prideful to ever go get professional help that started to affect me when i was 13, and it was a huge part of my early adulthood that hurt me more than anything. 

I grew up in a family that was and is still to this day very loving and even though they might not see it, i love them and i am grateful to have them on my side. They just instilled the idea that as a man in this family you show weakness reaching out for help, especially something as ridiculous(their description not mine) as anxiety.  So gradually I have never really reached out for help for anything because I didn't want them or others to think im weak and im exaggerating.  I continued to use heroin to deal with my anxiety and it worked.. i could go out and socialize, sit in class, talk to people, and never have to worry about a panic attack. But you all know where this leads to.. a damn physical dependency that traps you into a vicious cycle.  It took everything from me and still will until i get rid of this addiction for good.

when i turned 25 i had finally worked the courage up to get help for anxiety. I ended up finding a great  doctor who once we had tried every alternative , resorted to medication as a last resort to treating anxiety and ive been doing really well lateley. Ive managed to get educated again and will actually be a Registered Nurse next year. Somehow and i do not know how, ive managed to attain the highest gpa in my school while being addicted to opiates and I know its going to eventually end in me losing everything. 

 Im blessed enough to have a roof over my head and I cant stand to see my mom cry as she watches me slowly crumble away. My cousin died to drug addiction at the age of 27 and here I am approaching the same age and watching my entire family start to accept my fate will be the same is heartbreaking. Im trying to quit but i know they have lost hope in me. I can make it a week clean and i usually end up back at square one.  

The physical withdrawals arent an issue for me. Heavy lifting and hydrating and surrounding yourself with ppl who dont use and it isn't an impossible task.

I beat it did a stint in rehab for 90 days and felt amazing.
 I recaptured my life and stayed sober for 6 years, I accomplished so much. I bought multiple properties, opened 2 businesses, had 2 kids. But eventually things hit a rough patch and my family split up.... it devastate me, I stayed sober for 90 days after they left and then of course I wanted to forget, unfortunately I relapsed directly on to powerful fentanyl. It was inexpensive for the first few months. Eventually I was spending $500 a day on my habit, day after day... blew through my savings and I was working to to support my habit...it’s a vicious cycle..
   So after 2 years of this sleep, I finally had to stop working and stop money from coming in to get my shit right for my childerens sake. I know of 10 people dying just within the last year and I didn’t want to leave my kids without a father. 
   I’m on day 14 cold turkey from 5gs a day of extremely powerful fentanyl. Withdrawal the first few days was what you’d expect, I had some tar which wouldn’t even touch the wds, then I just said f it I can’t do it anymore by day 3 I told myself no more, never again... I’m far too weak to get off the shit so I can’t do it anymore...
  I’m on day 14 now and my body is numb, I’m weak, I can barely dress myself... I’m eating like a horse, putting all good foods into my body, but still I am too weak to get back to work or even stand up for more than a few minutes. I’m deathly afraid I’ve damaged my body..

I did it.,"Not bragging at all because of how early this is... but for the first time in 3 years I’ve gone 13 days without some form of oxy. I was literally being triggered daily by my daughters mother... I’m not ashamed to say I FOUND a pill (when I’ve ran out of pills in the past I’ve HUNTED for one I’ve dropped and never had any success), somehow some way on day 6 when I was struggling mentally because the physical withdrawals had started to cease enough for me to tolerate, I actually found a pill from my older plug (he died in May) so this had to be at least 7 months old but it was a roxy in damn near pristine condition... I stood there in disbelief for at least 5 minutes with that pill in my hand, my hands were trembling (that’s one WD symptom that still is here today my hands aren’t steady all the way), sorry I got sidetracked hope it didn’t take away from the moment. So I’m standing there with a pill that was free essentially knowing it would take away all the pain my bm was giving me, I said fuck this when I said I was done I meant it, and the amount of empowerment I felt literally chucking that tiny pill into the neighbors (unkept) long ass grass, man I can’t even explain. Now I’m on day 13 & despite being triggered multiple times daily, not sleeping more than an hour a night for about a week, and y’all know the rest... I feel better and stronger than ever. Literally all the odds were against me here, no treatment (I did it on the couch for an entire 8 days) the person I thought I was getting clean for was giving me reason after reason day after day to call one of my pill men but I realized when I threw that pill that I need to do this for me, my kids, if she comes back around cool, it but I need to do it for me. The moment I realized that there was no withdrawal I couldn’t conquer, I got my self-control back. Thank you to each and everybody, the dozens of you who replied to my last 2-3 posts... couldn’t have done it without y’all. I was absolutely hopeless a month ago, now all I can think about is how bright my future will be. This reminded me that my life is worth something. I never knew the grass would be this much greener on the other side, but to anybody going through the first 72 hours/first week... if you WANT to do it, nothing can stop you.

They did some drug tests and said there was a lot of shit mixed in me from one bag and from the other guy it was just dope (which is good to know)

What kind of doctor do I need to see? Do I just tell them I am looking to detox myself? Any advice would be appreciated.

I was getting in the best place I'd been in almost a decade. An old friend moved in temporarily (quarantine) just as winter hit. We've both matured a lot and have started a romantic relationship. She knows about my struggles, some details and some less detailed.

Ended up chipping every few days on 30s, just enough to avoid wds. Having her around made my preferred roa (snorting) hard and I just kind of tried to enjoy it. She hated me those days, but figured I was probably just taking my prescribed xanax more than I needed to and was really stoned. In reality, I was chipping opiates.

I've been two days clean from the latest binge and I am starting to come back to life. That one blurred the line between hangover/wds.

After all of the work I've done this past year, and especially the past few months, I'm not going to let me get this down. I've been crushing it at work, rebuilding a relationship during a really tough winter of quarantine, and I've been actively working on my mental health.

Thank the good Lord for benzos. First WD in a long time that I didn't mentally digest my brain with fear, paranoia, anxiety and anguish. I know now the worst is most likely over and I need to start tapering. I stayed around 1-2 mg xan a day. 

Gabapentin was like 10 gorgeous angels gently tickling my prostate. 600mg a day 2 doses. I think I did 900 one day. Combo with zan and I slept like a fucking newborn baby no shit. I basically slept 12+ hours a day. Couldn't even hold myself awake during the early evening and would nap for 1-3 hours even then wake up, take care of shit and then go back to bed.

I only took kratom 3 times. 3 g each time. Only when the symptoms were at the worst which was last night and today (sweating and chills)

Clonidine arrived today go figure so I tried it. 1mg dosage and helped basically same as kratom did although if I'm honest kratom was more effective but shorter duration. YMMV and this was only red vein. Greens and whites great for energy I hear.

So I'm laying here in bed past midnight knowing that I'm most likely over the hump. Great right? 

That's when for the first time since I quit the depression set in. I know I've been here before and how slow the process to rebuild myself is. I'm scarred, sad, and simultaneously excited. More the first two if I'm being honest. 

I really hope atleast one person who has shared my experience and in active addiction reads my timeline and understands that it is possible to get through this pain free (the acute part) if that's what they are afraid of. I know for me it was a HUGE factor. 

My wife is sleeping next to me, and my two beautiful cats, and I just feel so alone inside my own head. I didn't even tell her I was in WD this time because before my relapse the last time was pretty awful and didn't want to put her through that again.

I know we loved each other even though she says it’s in the past and she’s just trying to move on because it was all in West Palm Beach and we were together for 2 1/2 years and now I’m back home in my trigger world of St. Louis Missouri. Fast forward to now and I’ve been on and off Suboxone I’ve been using fentanyl or real dope if I can find it only snorting it, although I have shot it again a few times when it got heavy but not many times I always felt so guilty and broke the rig.I’m now at a point where the withdrawal is not too bad I’ve tapered myself down somehow by resisting with all of my might even having money and a car,  because I don’t have family to support me my mom doesn’t know much about any of this and he’s at work most of the time I’m 29 years old and should be up doing my own shit I lived on my own and had a duplex and even took care of her daughter who accidentally called me dad a few times. And now I am definitely horribly addicted to Benzos as I’ve been using them because the anxiety of coming off the street fentanyl in St. Louis is no joke. At the moment I get chills and I wake up in the night sweating beyond belief. But that’s also with 2 mg of Klonopin 20 mg of baclofen and sometimes Vistaril to. Not to mention weed.

I have a sister But she’s oblivious and if I told her I was actually doing dope I don’t know what she would do. I go to an IOP program and I’m supposed to be on Suboxone but they are also tapering me off Klonopin problem is I have a stash of Valium, clonazolam, and diclazepam. I also have the DCK hopefully coming To alleviate withdrawal symptoms if you’re aware the ketamine and it’s analogues can alleviate withdrawal symptoms even at low doses. But what I really need is to be put in a detox and a month-long program at least because my teeth are also destroyed and I need help finding a way to pay for it or to find someone to help me do it because I’m too young to not get implants.

(I am the youngest child, my brother is 10 years older than me). I’ve basically considered suicide many times since I turned 20 and opiates have actually fought against that urge. Until now, with me being virtually broke, unable to do anything about it.

Do I just need to tough it out for 3 days before things start getting better? Should I use the subs tomorrow if I manage to sleep? Should I spend my last 40 on xan so I might be able to just sleep through the next 3 days? I also have some cheap weed but it gives me anxiety.

Snorting it of course no IV. Now over the last month. I’ve desperately been trying to quit. All I have been using is gabapentin and weed.i do also have sodium ascorbate which is a pure form of Vit C although I haven’t took any of it however a decent amount of people say it does work. Anyways the main question is in the last month. I’ve went a day to 3-4 at times. And fucked up and used again. Every week now for a month this has happened. But now I’m looking at it as positive as I can. This has basically been like a hellish unintentional taper. And it isn’t for the amount. It’s for the timeframe. Basically went from using a half G every day to a half G like 2 maybe 3 times a week. So I guess now my question is. Does anyone think this will cause a change in the actual time it takes to feel better? Not necessarily having a less painful withdrawal but possibly having it only he like a 3-4-5 day thing until I start feeling better.... or would it still be a few weeks like usual... any input would be great.

So, a few months ago I really started to think about getting off the damn shit, after being on it for two years. Didn't really start to make the first steps until about a month ago. Only went down 2mg, but it was enough to be annoying enough to exasperate all my other current stressors, as the biggest problem was sleep. Fortunately though, I have past personal experience with using gabapentin to mitigate opioid withdrawal w/ actually pretty incredible success. So I brought the idea to my doc of doing a gabapentin assisted rapid taper. We both agreed that what's the rush? So, I just went down from 63 to 60, instead of doing the 10mg a week like I was planning. So far so good today! I have two doses of gabapentin left to take, and it's already helped a fair amount. I am just SO excited to not have this ball and chain anymore. I absolutely hate going to my clinic. I just do not want to be in that environment anymore. Can't wait to finally not have to go to that place every week anymore :)

I have a history with Hydrocodone, that's my love. I haven't tried anything stronger than that but that was enough for me to fall in love with opiates. I found PST in searching for a ""legal high"", I found it 5 years ago (if anyone knows this back in the SN days) when it used to be really strong (compared to now). I used for maybe 3 months in a row, all day high every day. Eventually I snapped out of it and decided to go cold turkey, to this day I'm scared of those 10-11 days of WD.

After quitting I thought I could use responsibly and just buy enough for 2 days and use every 2 weeks or so but that would land me in 4-5 days of WD's anyway so I did that for a month or 2 and eventually stopped.

I was clean for like 3 years till summer of 2019 I thought it'd be a good idea to try it again, telling myself I'd use once and stop. Of course that didn't work out, but being so scared of serious WD's I began using twice a week and WD'ing 5 days till I used again the next week. This way WDs weren't so terrible so I could still go to work and function normally, but I would ALWAYS feel like shit. I did that for 7 months till I quit mid January of this year.

&#x200B;

After 10 months of being sober, and I was so proud of it. Like a dumbass I gave in again and said ""I'd use once"". Well it's now been 5 weeks, and I'm back to my old routine. Use 2-3 days, WD for 5-6 days and do it again. I need to stop this, I can buy them online and get them delivered the next day, I don't even have to leave my house. They're expensive too, and I lost my job 4 months ago so every time I buy them I get so mad at myself. I need to find a job but I can't even pass a fucking drug test this way. I need to change.

&#x200B;

I have also struggled with alcohol for 5 years or so. I'd drink almost every night, never when I had opiates though. So basically I'm quitting 2 things at the same time, I hate alcohol in all honesty, it's just  that I need to alter my reality. So while I was sober for 10 months, or 3 years before that, I really wasn't. I haven't gone over a week truly sober in like 5 years. This past month I've only gotten drunk maybe 7-8 times because I've been drinking PST.

&#x200B;

I'm now 3 days sober from alcohol, and it's my 5th day without PST, but in reality it is my 2nd, since I can't order till Mondays so basically I was able to stay strong yesterday, but today I'm struggling not to order more. I do believe I'll be able to beat alcohol easily since I am too scared for my health. But I am struggling right now badly",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54899967}"

I am currently 48 hours in and, while very sleepy, functioning quite well and feel the WD but it's more like pain when your on painkillers after a surgery, basically ""the WD is in the other room, I feel it and I don't give a shit about it""

I actually missed my sub appointment because I slept in so much and my phone died, which was probably a blessing honestly. So I decided to just continue with the conform meds until it's over.

Tomorrow should be the worst day, or likely the day after that but so far I've only taken 2mg Xanax, and 600mg gabapentin and I'm pretty good. The clonidine never arrived unfortunately. I took 25mg trazadone as well last night, I'm actually prescribed 50mg but I'm trying to taper off it because it makes me groggy all day long now.

I am going to make another post to just so unbelievable the Xanax is for WD. Honestly I really doubt there is a better medicine than benzos for WD. I have never ever felt so comfortable in WD unless you count very very early in my addiction when I was only taking like 15 mg a day.

Last note: there is something odd about trazadone while on and coming off opiates. It's hard to put into words and maybe someone else has some info. But I had real m30 oxy's while I was taking my 50mg trazadone once per day at night. I can tell you the fucking trazadone, since I've been taking it for like two months, quite nearly blocks the effects of opiates. I would get high on them for like 15-30 minutes max and that is it. I thought my tolerance went through the roof for some reason at first, but I really don't think it could have that much. It does provide pain relief but that came with a lot of anxiety as well. I took oxy for anxiety relief and never have I ever experienced anxiety on oxy before so I even have like 10-12 left and not even taking them anymore.

When you do decide to kick, as many of you are right now, you will be tempted to induce suboxone on day 1, 2, and almost certainly 3 if you can wait that long. You WILL go into precipitated withdrawal. The fentanyl analogues out there currently are technically ""short acting opioids"" however, I believe this is a misnomer. They are technically short acting, but have a comparatively LONG half life (likely by design) relative to heroin or other SAOs. Meaning, it can take up to 96+ hours to fully eliminate fent analogue in your system, and that's a single dose. You likely will not be able to induce any amount of suboxone (titrating up) until 100+ hours. This is leading to protracted withdrawal and discomfort in clinical settings, beyond a 7 day period at times. Instead, seek comfort medications like colonidine and gabapentin to manage symptoms until you decide to induce ( if you still actually want to). When I went through my w/d I managed symptoms with kratom and benzodiazepines effectively until sever w/d abated, and feel much better not relying on the suboxone.

The physical symptoms of withdrawal are not as bad as the psychological ones. Those who have been through tramadol WD know it's fucking HELL. Much harder than an SSRI / SNRI WD.

But I was thinking, like tramadol it has a double action: SSRI and atypical opioid. I was wondering if any antidepressants can help with depression and extreme fatigue that comes with withdrawal? I have sertraline and can get venlafaxine.

I also have clonazepam and can buy pregabalin (they don't ask for a prescription where I live).

What do you think? Once tramadol is out of my system, would taking an antidepressant help? And how long would it take to get all the tramadol out of my system if I take it daily since May (500-1500 mg)? I don't want a serotonin syndrome.

Now she I have to be there for her.","Or get to to there for her? I’ve been sober from heroin (but not all opiates, I struggle off and on. But I’ll take the small victory) for 4 or 5 years. My best friend (who severely od’d about a decade ago. The doctors told her parents they needed to harvest organs and she made a spontaneous recovery) has not been so lucky. She just can’t seem to stop using for longer than a month or two. Alright- so that’s the background. 

My best friend, we’ll call her KK, recently met someone randomly. I actually met him shortly in a parking lot when I was borrowing some suboxone from KK because I left mine out of town. I met him one or two days before this happened.
This random kid (a 33 year old male, from the east coast) got KK’s number and ended up asking her where to get heroin. And she told him. She drove him. She “made him promise over and over. Like, 50 times, that he wouldn’t use needles.” (Kk has a belief that it is impossible to overdose if your are smoking H, the only people who OD use needles). The kid (I regret not knowing his name) also apparently bought some Xanax. I don’t know if he used it. The kid went home and he OD’d. His best friend found him after sometime; it must have been awful. 

When KK told me this- the entire story- I couldn’t help but blame her in my mind. Not completely, but...
He obviously had no idea where to get H from around our parts. She could’ve lied and said no. But she didn’t have to tell him where; and she definitely didn’t have to bring him there, and personally introduce him to the dealer. But she did, and this guy is dead. 

I love KK. Ever since she almost died (bitch was sooo close!) she has never seemed to grasp the severity of how opiates can cause death and they severely fuck up your family’s life when you’re gone. When she told me about this- it was almost nonchalant. She blamed a lot of it on the victim. She’s minimizing, in my mind. 

I’m just... I feel SO bad for the person who died. He may have thought he was just experimenting or lightly relapsing ( I don’t know his background). And he died. When I was using- part of the allure was maybe dying, but That’s not everyone). I want KK to understand she played a major role in this tragedy. I want her to learn that H is nothing but heartbreak and sickness. I want HER to STOP already. I don’t want to lose her. And now this human is dead. She could be dead, again, someday soon if she doesn’t realize H is bad new bears. Why.  This drug is awful. I wish we all weren’t slaves and victims to it. 

Thanks for the vent- apologies for the mobile format. 
I would like this to be an open discussion; if anyone has advice, obviously I could use some.

I know what it’s like to be at the bottom and I pray for everyone still there.

I’ve honestly never imagined myself the kind of person that would ever be sober. From a young age I’ve always been intoxicating my system with some kind of chemical, no matter what it is. Starting from smoking weed and drinking with friends, my use slowly progressed into IV heroin use. Heroin is my demon and I know where she takes me.

The most important things that have kept me sober besides myself are my supportive family, my girlfriend, and my 6 month old daughter. I can’t stress enough how important it is to have a good support system when getting clean. To this day, I am still jamming my schedule full with work, school, and family just because I’m terrified of being by myself with nothing to do.

To anyone still struggling, trust me when I say that the grass is TRULY greener on the other side. It might take some hard work, but life changing decisions don’t come easily. You can rebuild and your life will be better than you could ever imagine in less than a year, if you work for it.

I invite any questions, and I hope everything is going well for you. Here is the direct copy and paste from about 3 or 4 years ago. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry if this story is a little choppy. I'm typing it all on mobile. Here it goes.

For years I was an I.V. heroin/Dilaudid junkie. I spent about 100 dollars a day. I stole from my family, alienated all my friends, and was just generally an awful person to be around.

It was 2009. I was living back with my parents as I had gotten kicked out of my previous 3 living situations. After living there for a few months, my dad was fed up with me and my thievery and general malaise. He told me if I don't get a job and a new place to live in a month, I would be out on the streets. I was desperate to make a change and get clean. I was 23 at the time and had been using since age 17. It was time for a change, and I knew what I had to do.

I went to my local recruiter's station and joined the army... completely on a whim. I faked all my piss tests (kept a little pee pee in a five hour energy bottle tucked securely into my taint). I lied a lot about my history with drugs (I was 5'10"" and 100 lbs with an arm full of track marks. Who was I kidding?) until finally the day came to ship out.

I hadn't even cut down my usage before I left. Still the same 100 dollar a day habit until the minute I boarded the plane. I arrived at the the barracks at basic training in Fort Jackson, SC still high on about 16mg of Dilaudid I.V. that I shot before the plane ride. Little did I know what was about to happen.

The night we arrived, we were assigned temporary bunks to ""get some rest"" in. I put my bag into my locker and immediately was accosted by a drill sergeant, screaming at me (and everyone else) to get outside and line up in formation. I stood there in the dark with all of the other strangers and awaited instructions. I was starting to come down pretty hard. We were instructed to get in line (there were over 250 of us) to be issued Physical Fitness uniforms. The line took several hours to be done. After that, it was about 4 in the morning and I was in full-on withdrawal.

We stood in lines for the rest of the day getting issued heavy equipment, getting immunizations and getting our heads shaved. I was exhausted by around midnight when we were supposed to be done and get some rest. Did that happen? No. Instead, one of us got in trouble, so the rest of us were forced to do push-ups, overhead arm claps and other exercises until exhaustion (which was pretty quick for me, of course).

We were finally allowed to go to sleep around 4 in the morning after being awake for the last 48 hours. The withdrawals were worse than any I had ever had. I just laid in my bunk crying, having restless leg, and wanting to kill myself. We were awoken for morning PT 2 hours later.

I came downstairs and outside for PT, a mess. I stood there in formation feeling like I was about to collapse when suddenly... I sharted. My pants filled with gooey diarrhea and I stood there trying to look casual. When the formation marched off, I quietly slipped off and ran back upstairs to my locker to change and throw away my army-issued shart shorts. I was going to be in trouble when I reunited with my platoon. Instead of trying to find them, I sat on the toilet and cried and puked until it was time for breakfast. Miraculously, I slipped back into formation without drawing attention.

For the next 2 nights, I didn't sleep more than about 30 minutes. I've never been so physically and mentally exhausted in my life. My thoughts at the time were all of running away into the woods and living in the woods forever like some sort of junkie Bear Grylls. I was on the brink of killing myself for the first four days until finally, on the fifth day, I slept. It was the sweetest sleep I've ever had or will ever have. When I woke up, I was over the hump. I was so happy I cried (yeah, I cried a lot in this story, but come on. You would cry too if it happened to you.).

After 5 days of intense personal hell, I was normal again. In fact, dopamine started flowing in my brain in ways it never had before. I was so happy and social and positive. I was myself again for the first time in years. I relapsed the first day I got home on leave, but it was temporary and I went back to the army where I stayed clean for my entire four year stint. I joined in 2009, got out in 2013 and still haven't gone back to using. And I never will.

I hope this story helps any of you. I know this is a completely unorthodox way of getting sober, and I honestly wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, but that's what worked for me. I'm not entirely happy, as I suffer from PTSD and depression, but it's a hell of a lot better than the junkie life I lived before. It can get better, and I hope it does for you too.

Edit: I left out the most torturous/hilarious part of the story.

On the fourth day, I finally decided to go to sick call and tell them that I was going through opiate withdrawal. I went in, and was seen by an army doctor. I told him all about my withdrawal and what I was going through. I fully expected to be discharged in shame. But instead, in true Army fashion, the doc gave me a bottle of ibuprofen and told me to drink water and try to run a mile or two. I left sick call and went immediately to the bathroom to cry and throw up more. That was the night I finally slept and got better. So I thank that army doc for not ratting me out and forcing me to push through, whether it was out of lazy ineptitude or not.

I recently quit and stayed clean for 2 months before relapsing. I don't know if im just being a pussy or if I am just extremely psychologically addicted but, it was extremely difficult last time I quit. Physically it sucks but I hardly have the symptoms that most of y'all have experienced (like cold sweats, vomiting, and massive diarrhea). Mentally though, the anxiety and depressing is completely debilitating.

So I started the process to hopefully get Suboxone before I run out again because I'm terrified of going through withdrawal again. I have a pregnant wife and I'm currently a full time student so I don't have the ability to just put everything on hold.

Is Suboxone way too strong for me? I only want to use it to get clean without the pain. So 4-5 days I'm thinking. After that I know I can fight my way through PAWS because I truely am ready to be done with this shit. My end goal is to get on vivitrol for about a year to prevent myself from relapsing.

Side note: I've stocked up on comfort meds in preparation and currently have 60 1mg Xanax, 10 600mg gabapentin, red kratom capsules, weed cartridge (helps physically but makes the anxiety worse) trazadone, and hydroxyzine for sleep, and phenibut (but I wont take that more than once a week).

It all felt so real. When I woke up this morning my urge to use was insane. But I'm staying strong

They gave me a piss test and it turns out there was NO trace of oxy in my system at all. Little did I know that I was buying fake pressed fentanyl pills made to look like a 20mg oxy pill for months now. So now the process is going to be a little different and more difficult than expected. They said they are trying a different method they haven’t used before where I take a small amount of suboxone and morphine so I don’t get sent into precipitated withdrawals which is apparently 100x worse. BEWARE PEOPLE. At the amounts I was using anyone of those pills could have been dosed just too much and I wouldn’t be here typing this. People are losing there life to this every day so my advice would be if you don’t know exactly where it came from then don’t fucking take the shit for gods sake and if you don’t absolutely have to for medical purposes don’t take any at all. I am only 25 but I have waisted pivotal years of my life looking for that next pill and threw away so many opportunities and relationships over this stupid shit. I’m only on day one but I’m fucking fed up and I’m going to beat this monster. The soboxone morphine combo is at least getting me by somewhat for now just praying that I can get off of that easy enough I’m trying to be optimistic. I’d take this then feeling the full effects of wd for sure so don’t be afraid to make that first step and get some help I’m happy I did so far. I’ll give another update soon.

Gotta learn from this experience.  Definetly still recovering. The human body can react so uniquely to different situations. Our stories are our own.

Over the last year, I have been trying to help several people living on the streets. One is a mid-20s homeless guy week will call ""The Kid"". 

I saw him in the same spot  almost daily for months. He always seemed clean and cheerful, and grateful for any help. I can't actually recall ever seeing him with a cardboard sign or anything, but the way he passed between stopped cars at the traffic lights made it pretty clear he was looking for handouts. 

I might offer him a pack of pop tarts and a Pepsi, or (if I had some ready to distribute) offer him one of the care packages of clothing and grooming essentials, snacks, and bottled water that I keep in my car for the *numerous* homeless people I see in my city. Occasionally I will tape smaller bills ($1-$5) to water bottles or granola bars to hand out. He always told me his helpful it was to get three things. I was hoping he'd manage to get off the streets if he had a chance.

""The Kid"" always smiled and thanked me. He is one of three ""chronic homeless"" that I am on a first name basis with, and I recently asked ""The Kid"" what would be helpful to him.

For Instance: 

If he writes, notebooks and pens, 

if he draws, pencils and a pad, 

if he needs to get around, a bike (I see them free on Craigslist often), etc. 

A coat? Boots?

Then he vanished for a month before ever answering, but *after* I had gotten him some fall clothes, socks, shirts, etc. When I stopped seeing him there, I hoped he might be off the streets, or have moved somewhere warm, while also worrying he had been arrested, beaten up, or gotten COVID. 

Now, maybe I am a jerk, but I am particular about what I give homeless people. I won't give out hand sanitizer because the alcohol.in it can kill you if ingested, and some homeless have problems with alcohol and get sick from it. I don't give anything sharp, so cutlery is all disposable, because I do not want someone to hurt themselves or others, and no lighters, because I don't want someone crashing in a vacant house (we have lots) and accidentally burning it down.

I am also particular about who I help. I work hard for my money, and everything I give and do is out of pocket, so helping people in real need or those who are trying to get on their feet. I don't approach anyone""swaying"" like a seasick sailor, or obviously on opiates because my background leaves me I'll prepared to help in a meaningful way.

I also seem to be, to coin a phrase, ""dope blind"". I am constantly surprised when I find out someone I know has a problem with opiates, and have been close to a few who did financial and emotional damage to me as a result. I am kind of wary of ""junkies"". But I don't always notice the signs. Unless you are nodding out, or making excuses to borrow money, I probably wouldn't have a clue.

So anyway, ""the Kid"" reappeared a few days ago. He still has a great attitude, and was very happy to get clothes I had been carrying around for him. We spoke quickly, as I passed his care package to him through the car window, and until the light changed. He mentioned that he had found a place to stay, but because he was not on the lease, was thrown out after a month. He had lost all his ""stuff"" then, and looked cold.

I went home, grabbed a warm jacket for him, and wanted to give him a few bucks ($10) for things he might need right away, or food, or 2 nights at the shelter. I handed them to him the following day. He seemed really excited about the cash, probably because 99% of drivers are tired of roads lined with tents, or guys/gals with signs and are not inclined to do anything, or even meet their eyes. 

He thanked me for the t-shirts and socks I had just given him days earlier, and said that he ""hated to seem greedy"" but that if I had another of those care packages, he really could use the clothes (2 t-shirts, a thermal, a flannel, and 2 pair socks). I was out of kits at the time, but went that night to purchase supplies to build a dozen more (which I do 1-2x a month for whoever I see in need) so I would have one for him the next day/yesterday.

Yesterday, he was not in the regular spot.

For some reason, even though I was off work today, I debated driving into the city to see if he was in the area. When I had a legitimate errand come up that would take me within a mile of there, I detoured. It was a longshot, as it was pouring rain, but he was sleeping on a bench under an overhang. It was a bit away from where I normally see him, and I wasn't sure it was him at first, so I parked, left the bag of clothes in my car, and took a water bottle with $5 taped to it and approached on foot to be sure, planning to leave the bottle for ""whoever"" if it was not ""The Kid"".

He woke up, but seemed ""sleepy"". I thought he was still half asleep, or possibly high on pot (not sure if that should bother me - it doesn't). He and I talked, I learned he had lost his entire family (sibling, parent, aunt, grandparent) within a short period of time over the 2015-2018 time period resulting in him being homeless most of the time since.

I gave him the clothes, offered to/did take his laundry home to wash and return to him tomorrow, and got him 7-11 pizza (his choice) and transit fare to I really don't know where. Tomorrow I will take his laundry back, along with a weekly bus pass and a 7-11 gift card for another pizza.

For some reason, I looked him up on facebook this evening, not really thinking he would be there. 

He has 2 profiles. One before his family died, and one set up a few weeks ago. The newer one references a desire to ""stay clean"" of opiates, apparently injected, based on needle/arm references, along with a desire to get his life back before it is too late. The post is less than 2 weeks old. The change in his circumstances (being back on the street) and demeanor (seemingly ""stoned on pot"") suggest a relapse is not out of the question.

I checked the state criminal database and see he had several streets for possession going back a few years. Each arrest lists him as homeless. Each charge was dropped, aside from a jaywalking charge with an open fine.

I feel like giving him cash (even $5-$10) might not be in his best interests. But I worry that not giving him cash may be harsh... when I do not have any basis, or *right* to assume I know how he will spend it. I know a lot can change in 10 days, and he may be ""done quitting for now"" or he may have just slipped up, and still wants to get/stay clean. He may not have relapsed at all. But knowing he is in recovery, what should I do?

I still want to help.him but that may mean something different to him than it does to him. I want him to quit if he is *serious* about it, do *not* want to support the addiction in any way, or be taken advantage of. Even if he decides he is not ready to get clean now, I would like to help him with bus passes, snacks, laundry, and his expressed desire to get a flu shot, but think I ought to let him know what I know. I don't think he was hiding it specifically to be dishonest, but that addiction is not something you just open up about.

In a perfect world, I could talk to him, let him know there won't be cash for a while, he tells me that he wants to make something of his life, and we figure out how to make it happen.

But, should I offer to help him find resources for housing, rehab, food stamps, health care, etc.? Or, after 5 years on the street and on heroin, am I setting myself up for disappointment? 

The Twist:

I have two kids. A few years ago, my mid-20s daughter fell behind on her rent. It just seemed like a series of unforeseeable bad luck - lost a good  job, car repossessed, breakup leaving her to pay full rent alone, followed by discovery he had ""cleaned out the bank account"" and later ""ran up a joint credit card"" leaving her to pay - confessed to me that she was 20 weeks pregnant. She then revealed that the majority of the financial issues were the result of the two of them being addicts. The job loss, repo, breakup and empty accounts, all of it.

She got clean, has stayed clean, now has two amazing kids and pays her bills on time... So I don't dismiss addicts as ""too damaged"" to change if they want to.

Help?

Obviously we have all heard these words one time or another ""get help"" or ""you need help"" or ""seek help""  
What I want to ask is.... what does this actually mean?  
I know its different all over the world but many many times during my active addiction (countless times) I have gone to a hospital, gone to a doctor, specialists, therepists... anyone who will listen and asked... begged for help.. and almost every time I have just been told ""I can't help you"" or at best ""what do you want me to do?""  
I just want to know... what is it exactly that people mean when they say ""get help"" ??  
Have I been doing it wrong ? I don't know... but I do know that in my country my conclusion is that there is no help... all I have ever gotten is an awkward situation where a doctor or therepist basically tells me they don't know what they can do for me..
granted, where I am.. heroin is not a popular drug, far far from it (meth is the drug of choice) and I see a lot of posters for help with meth addiction.. but there is really nothing here except maintenance.  
  ( to give you some perspective at how rare heroin is here, I was arrested a year ago by 3 cops, I was carrying less than a point (a bag) and no joke.. the cops said to me while we were in a room later.. that they had never seen heroin before)  

Anyway, I do really want to know exactly what people mean when they say to get help... I think that there is a huge misconception that if you're an addict you can just pickup a phone or go somewhere and ask for help and suddenly a whole bunch of people are going to sweep in and pick you up and tell you that theyre going to help you..... the reality could not be any further from that.

They just made me fall asleep and I still feel like I'm going to throw up almost a day later. I actually ended up flushing the last two because they made me feel so sick. 

I'm beating myself up for being so weak. Luckily I don't think this setback will throw me back into any kind of physical withdrawal. But I just feel so stupid. I know all I can do is move forward and do the next right thing. 

I'm so glad that it's getting dark earlier now, because at night even though I can't sleep very well, I've started to feel some kind of calm. I think it's because at night I can lie around in bed and not feel like I'm being useless. No one expects anything of me. I can just watch TV in the dark and quiet. I probably sound melodramatic, but I'm so depressed this has become my only solitude. 

Fuck, I just wish I could go back and call someone or post on here or something instead of picking up that bullshit.

Edit:
After thinking about it, I realize I can't beat myself up for this. I slipped, and I can get right back on track. I need to be grateful that this slip didn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it did the opposite. This also proves to me that I need to involve myself in AA or NA whether it's zoom or in person meetings and rebuild a network, and focus on gratitude and meditation to help build a defense against further slips.

I just slipped after my second time (in life) trying to get clean off blues... was using kratom and have a prescription for Xanax (that I don’t abuse) tomorrow I was going to the doctor to see if she’d give me any muscle relaxers.. all to help me through this detox. But my question is, please EVERYONE feel free to comment and pm me no matter what you have to say, I need all the help I can get. It seems like everytime I get to a certain point I slip, my will power to continue fighting turns into suicidal thoughts when I hit the Day 1 leading into day 2 mark.. I’ve been detoxing (slowly) for about a week now... but if I’m just going to keep slipping and end up buying a blue the second any money comes to me, I have children to think about also and one of their moms finally reached her breaking point with me less than a week ago... I’m going on and on sorry my question to all of you is this: I’m 23, probably been an addict for 2 maybe 2 and a half years now, would a 6-8 week methadone maintenance program still lead to the (ENDLESS) withdrawals that most people warn to stay away from methadone for that reason? I know now what my problems (that have lead to relapse) are: is that I’m afraid to look at my life completely sober until I’ve rebuilt some of it where methadone would come in so I can right to rebuilding the bridge with my daughters mom and actually keep the money I earn and spend it on the kids/help her with bills and rent within a day or 2 if methadone does it’s job I know that sounds pussy but I had everything and these pills took it all now the one person who never seemed to give up on me is gone and quitting is one thing when you have support of loved ones but you all know it’s a different battle when loved ones don’t care, where methadone would come in so I can right to rebuilding the bridge with my daughters mom and actually keep the money I earn and spend it on the kids/help her with bills and rent within a day or 2 if methadone does it’s job... or will that just lead to an all out month long detox down the line? All my life’s details aside my direct question is this: If I get on a methadone program for a short amount of time as opposed to going through a week (or more) of withdrawals now, will it still lead to the agonizing months long withdrawal that so many people warn about? I’ve never taken methadone in my life i know this isn’t Switzerland where they give you something that gets you just as high as the drugs you’re trying to quit but idek what methadone feels like is my point... I just heard simply enough “it works for some people and some it doesn’t but regardless don’t stay on it long”. My NEED to get sober is there guys and honestly my WANT is almost just as strong every time I think about the family I have to lose... then I think “what if I already lost it?” and my mind instantly tells me if that’s the case you have no purpose breathing anymore whether you’re sober or using and it falls apart. Sunday was the day I told myself I was done, it’s now Tuesday night I took 3 blues in 3 hours and barely even enjoyed them.. they didn’t even feel the same.

First I would like to apologize for the format since I’m on mobile. I’m currently dosing daily of methadone with a dose of 55mg. However I have been thinking about quitting cold turkey to pass the army enlisting drug test. I’m very passionate about the army and it’s my dream however the liquid handcuffs are holding me back. I have already taken the asvab and passed and my recruiter tells me I’ll be ready to ship out in January. Long story short my dad is a fucking hard ass and if he finds out I’ve been doing drugs he’ll have my head on a spike and I will disappoint my entire family. My reputation will be ruined and I’ll be looked down upon. I’m 22 years of age. I was thinking on quitting NOW cold turkey and hopefully by January withdrawals symptoms will easy up. If that’s not possible I don’t know what to do since I have already told my entire family I’ll be shipping out January. I won’t know how to tell them that I can’t go due to methadone. I would appreciate some advice on going cold turkey very much. This is what I want to do if it’s possible I’m willing to drop everything and open the gates of hell to join the military. I also talked to my recruiter and he suggested I drop the methadone since by the time I will be on basic training “my body will be too busy to notice withdrawals” I really don’t know what to do I am lost, confused and scared to my core I’m frightened.

Anyways grounding is a technique I learned in counseling that really helped me fight off drug cravings/triggers that would normally cause me to use. This takes time, practice and you have to put effort into this for any of this to be effective. Don't think just using any of these methods one time is going to instantly change your life, I don't know maybe for some people the first time it will truly help them. However, for me I had to practice it a lot, this can also be used for anger/self harm/sadness basically any negative emotion or action that you know in the end is wrong and don't want to do but usually can't help it once the thought gets in your head. I'm still thinking about making a discord since not a lot of people said whether or not that's something they are interested in, but this is something that made my path to getting and staying clean a lot easier. It's something I still practice to this day mainly because my problem isn't drug addiction anymore, my problem now is coping with the loss of my soulmate.

Not playing video games, not reading my favorite books, I don’t have energy to go play basketball (plus the weather is about to suck in a couple days), just every single one of my interests I have no desire to do right now. I gain no pleasure from anything. And this just keeps going on, it’s why I keep using again. I just get to a point where I can’t keep going on without any happiness in my life, and just nothing, not even my SO is making me happy like this. The other hard part is, because I’ve always been the “smart kid” and have a great job everyone in the family (and her family) admires me so I can’t have anyone finding out, especially her. She would just get so angry I hid this and blew so much money.

-Are the GI issues permanent? Last time I quit (2 months), my stomach was still only around 50%. If I take Metamucil, I’m OK. Still smelly, but at least it’s not an atomic bomb every bathroom outing. But when does this go back to normal? I’ll never forget that I had a friend comment how terrible my bathroom smelled one time, so I know it’s not in my head :) I also had a GI doctor look at my stomach a couple years ago, and he couldn’t find anything with an endoscopy.

-Boredom. Yeah, exercise helps tremendously. I feel invincible for 1-2 hours. But other than that, I find myself so bored at my desk working or just doing every day things like watching TV or eating dinner. My addict brain reaches for coffee to help stimulate my mind, but I just end up feeling worse an hour later. What do you guys do to combat this?

So after looking for detox centers for days and non accepting my insurance I was about to give up trying because I truly didn't think I could withdrawal at home since you gotta be so mentally strong for that and rn I'm just not. But I ended up going to the hospital with the intent of just getting a fix but this one really sweet doctor could see I was struggling and she took time to sit with me and just get to know me and my story and she could obviously see my opioid prescription history and I gave them access to my medical records which I guess showed notes from other doctors. Anyways it took her having to come back several times to convince me not to leave AMA since I've had doctors treat me like shit just because they think I'm just a addict. They set up a plan and I had a final dose of dilaudid at 12 noon yesterday (better they pulled my history, all I originally said was I was in pain) and then at 6PM they gave me 8MG of suboxone and admitted me to the hospital. And my insurance covers this hospital 100%. They said that the suboxone will help with withdrawl and cravings along with help manage my pain. They are giving me it every 8 hours. And had to give a few 2MG small doses to help the withdrawal feelings. So I'm about 30 hours clean and feel great. My mind is clear. Most my symptoms were last night but they have me on meds to help symptoms rn as well. I was so worried since the only other time I did detox was at a place that uses subutex and didn't dose it properly so it didn't help. And at that time I didn't even want to get sober. But now I do want to be clean. I'm going to try and do daily check ins. I'll try to not have them be this long every day lol.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50465715}"

The long and short of it is that I went from being someone in my 20s who ran two miles a day, to spending two years being unable to walk more than 2 city blocks and was in constant pain. 

I finally hit a wall this Fall where I realized I was using the pills more for emotional comfort than I was to dull the physical pain. That my body *was* finally healing. The pain was mostly gone. But I had retreated into a cocoon and given up. I was tired of the pain. But I was even more tired of the shell of a life I had, and that the only thing keeping me in that shell were the pills — not the health ailments anymore. 

After a few starts and stops, through immense support from friends and family, I’m now at a month clean. 

I haven’t had significant pain in the last week or so, and my pain management doc did a “I told you so” in saying I very likely had opiod induced hyper sensitivity to pain. I am busting my ass every day in physical therapy. I’m reconnecting with life long friends who I drifted apart from. 

I have a long road to emotional and physical recovery but for the first time in three years I can say with clarity and without hesitation: Things are good. 

I never thought I’d be able to get here. I thought the pain was just too much to deal with without the pills. But I got through it.

My habit was 200 to 300 mg a day, 2 mg held me 24 hours. Use it as a tool and move on.

I posted a few times through this experience lol. 
So as title says I took my last dose 9 days ago early morning, started at low 2mg of subs that night, used 2 mg for 2 days then jumped off. 

Now I’m 9 days since last oxy dose, yesterday was my 6th off subs, or 5. I’ve lost complete track of time recently just focusing on getting to the next minute lol. 

I’m not saying this is painless but the first few days on subs I felt fine, it gave me some separation from taking 3 pills every 2 or so hours. Anything done 3 days in a row becomes a habit, I think I broke the habit of having to do something every couple hours. 

Here’s where your determination to get clean comes in 


Now when I jumped off subs. I did NOT feel the best but the piper has to be paid, no it wasn’t horrific, no it wasn’t anything like you hear about sub withdrawals, nor was it even remotely like oxy wds. All I felt was slightly less energy, and felt a bit down for like 2 days., it’s like I skipped the first days of hell and was catapulted to the part where you feel fine just a little downs. 

You have to push through that part or your risking letting the subs build up and cause worse withdrawals. You have to stick through this point. 

I took my last dose on I forgot what day but it was at night, 2 mg. Then from then on no subs at all. it’s now 5 almost 6 days off subs I should of felt it by now. If it was coming, the first 2 days off subs were slightly uncomfortable, I was tired and kinda feeling down but that was easily countered by playing with my son or taking the wife for a walk and dinner. 

It can be done guys, don’t let people tell you subs are the absolute devil. They aren’t for everybody, but the major issue is doctors not understanding. Do research it was made as a rapid detox drug, doctors are prescribing 12mg sometimes 16mg A DAY! For way to long, which causes those horrible detox stories you hear. Stay low dose, jump off ASAP.

Yes subs has its place in long term, for some people it’s either subs long term or a life of hustlin, betting high, and risking freedom or death. But some of us can use it as a tool to bypass the worst and come out feeling much clearer on the other side.

No I’m not all preaching because I’m 9 days clean that ain’t nothing, I’m just posting this to try and help the people who can never make it past day 3 or 4 because i was once that person.

2020-11-07 07:24:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/jppzmq/its_been_a_weird_six_months/,It’s been a weird six months,"Like many people I lost my job back in April and promptly relapsed losing three years of sobriety in the process. I’ve been technically living with my girlfriend the past two years but I always kept my own apartment even though I was only there maybe once a week, I suppose it was important to me that I maintained some kind of independence and personal space. Anyway I lost the apartment back in July (like one does during a relapse) and went to a short stint in treatment. As a side note, being back in a shitty state funded detox after nearly four years of being clean and doing well was a singularly shitty experience, the previous time I was there I was coming off nearly a decade of opiate use and I was completely destitute, desperate and grateful just to have a bed. I would have stayed longer if the let me. This time however, there was the added shame and guilt of finding myself sweating it out on a ridged, plastic hospital mattress, getting my shoelaces taken away, and eating jail food after the success and happiness i had found in sobriety. Needless to say I had not expected to find myself there again in this life, not after the hell I’d been through previous. Worse yet was the fact that it being a relatively short relapse, just a few months, I had my wits about me, I was acutely aware of my surroundings and circumstances which only compounded the shame of the situation. It’s one thing to go to the psych unit after spending time living in a car or worse, but arriving from your own comfortable home just stings a little more I guess. This is not to say I have regrets about seeking help, I’ve now been clean since late August (with the exception of a few weeks of suboxone) and I’m extremely grateful for that. Anyway, I railroaded myself, the point of this post is about losing my home and I’m now living full time with my girlfriend and it’s been a struggle. For one thing I always took pride in the fact that she had never seen me high or known that version of me, after this summer that is no longer the case and I’m having a hard time with that. She doesn’t seem to harbor any obvious resentment about it besides the usual trust issues but it bothers me immensely. I don’t know if this would be considered addict behavior but the idea of fully committing to the situation and sharing my life completely with someone is terrifying, I haven’t even unpacked my stuff yet. Maybe it’s ridiculous but it’s always felt important to hold on to my own identity and maintain a certain amount of independence and this feels like giving in. Maybe it’s selfish but my thinking is that I’m 36 and the majority of my adult life has been spent addicted and mentally unwell, certainly not pursuing happiness and fulfillment. I’m still searching for something as I think all people deserve to be happy, and I have lingering doubts that this situation isn’t it. My girlfriend has a very successful career and a young son and rightfully so she just wants a normal family dynamic and frankly that kinda scares the fuck out of me. I often think I spent so much of my formative years high or engaging In unhealthy behavior that I don’t even know who I am. I don’t know, just some things that keep me up at night.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6285839}"

I relapsed and attempted suicide (Help me??),"On Oct. 31 2020 I managed to get my hand on some good pharmaceuticals from a friend who was even nice enough to drop them off for me! It had been a while an I thought this wonderful dose of the 'real deal' would do as usual and be just what I needed to quell the anxiety and racing thoughts in my mind. I guess I shouldn't be too specific but I took a lot. Not crazy but over 100mg of real meds and... Nothing. 

It was like I was on something that blocked my receptors. Which I am not on at all right now. No meds, no shots, just got my hands on shit and thought I'd have a nice night after being a while since I last dosed. 

But no. 

I didn't get high. 

At all.

Or maybe I did. I am not sure. I am also an alcoholic and was quite drunk at the time but I didn't get that sleepy nodding euphoria I ache and long for daily as it is. 

So I sat there at my computer desk inside my bedroom and felt nothing but drunk and oh so foolish and a thought occurred to me. 

I am a fucking pathetic joke.

This is what my life is surmounting to? A daily craving to find something that calms me down and makes my eyelids droop? I'm an un-properly medicated bipolar 1 total basket case and currently working with my pych for the 20th+ time for a medication change/switch around for something that keeps me from catapulting into a mania or slunking downward into a deep depression because mixed episodes are triggered frequently by one medication or another not working properly. I've had 11 rounds of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy, aka ""Shock Therapy"" but I honestly swear it is a standardized medical procedure I endured happily because you are sedated and it is a painless process with no lasting cognitive problems or memory issues (sadly for that last one I was hoping to have some permanent amnesia from my memories but can't even get that lucky)), been in the psych ward at least 17 different times (willingly I check in when I get suicidal, usually, as I surprisingly still have family who tell me they would miss me if I killed myself/od'd) with 6 of those times now me admitting to using and detoxing honestly from opiates. Always subs and a valium or ativan taper which I promptly always drop upon returning home and ride out the sub withdrawal for the needed time for the half life of the opiate antagonist to wear off so I can begin using again without wasting too much. 

I lie to myself, I get out, say I can handle this I swear, and promptly begin drinking. Alcohol is my first love, and our co-dependent relationship is that of strained married lovers who have drifted apart over the years in favor of another in the heart whenever we lie together as one. However she still is and forever will be my old faithful, someone who I can drag my miserable carcass back to when I chuck sobriety over my shoulder with so much guilt. But she has always been the first to take me back in, welcome me back home, and dull the shame of how weak I truly am as a human being and give me the bravery of hitting up random strangers on dating apps to see if they have access to the pills I need. They always do, and my dignity has been gone a long time, a little effort on my part gets men handing over anything to keep me at their apartments or hotel rooms a little while longer. I've got a decent face, a decent body, I never have to worry about being cut off from money or quitting my job randomly. Did I mention I am a waste as a human being?

Anyway. I'm sitting there dosed with a large amount of nice shit and I feel nothing satisfactory which is the epitome of my life, so I sit there drunk and disgusted and suddenly I am overcome with a irrational urge to just do it already. Stop being a fucking coward for once in my life and *do something already*. So I did. I swallowed a almost full bottle of my prescribed sleeping medication and for some reason topped it off with three foil packs of benadryl because I had it right in front of me don't ask.

Then I sat there waiting for the medication to kick in and thought ""hey that was a bit impulsive, what do they always say? Always leave a note!"" So I grabbed a notepad and proceed to write an 8 page apology letter to those I still have in my life. I could only imagine the ranting diatrive I went off on, I have still yet to call the hospital I was transferred to by ambulance to see if I can come get the note. I really want to read it again. I really hope they don't throw it away after transfer to the psych unit. 

Well as luck comes to have it someone came over to my place and let themselves in. Apparently by then I was standing stripped to my boxers babbling incoherently to the wall and after they failed to be able to make me make sense they started looking around, found my note, called 911. Apparently the paramedics were very nice even though I kept taking off the BP cuff. Apparently I had a burst of energy before collapsing that had me 'make a run for it' where I was going fuck-knows and the police on scene grabbed me and I fell on the patio over a chair and they cuffed me and I was resisting a bit so they used a bit of force. I have some bruises on my arms where they steered me towards the gurney and wrists from the cuffs where I was pulling. But no charges were filed or anything, they were sympathetic to the scene and just helping me get to the hospital. After being placed on the gurney I lost the blackout consciousness I had and has a GCS score of 4 arriving at the ER, my stomach was pumped, and I was kept 24hrs waking the hell up with a 1on1 in the ER psych unit before I was transferred to a shitty facility where I just spent 6 days.

I'm telling all of this because I have no one else to tell. No one has asked me what happened, not a therapist at the ward, and I am a loser with no real connections in life. The only messages I received turning my phone back on for the first time was a grocery list I sent to myself and a bunch of ""?"" asking where I went on hookup apps from men and women I had been talking to. So I guess they care, that's nice huh? Haha.

Moreover, I guess my point is, I have no point. 

I just wanted to rant. 

I made it 6 days 18hrs without a drink before I sat back behind my desk opened my drawer and pulled out a can of whatever I had stored there. I smashed my phone with a claw hammer so I can't meet up with people as easily. 

So I sit here sipping a third can of whatever this is and can't help but chuckle to myself. I have heard that when someone survives a suicide attempt they awake grateful that they had not been successful, realizing with some epiphany that life's troubles can be solved and the world is not as cruel a place as they had been imagining it to be. 

I have none of that. 

I ruefully smile and shake my head. I can't even manage to take myself out when I was actively trying. What a genius I am. I have asked several therapists what the point of this abject suffering is? Drifting through life without being able to maintain a stable frame of mind long enough to maintain long term financial security, manic episodes where I am out of my mind on delusions of grandaur and sexual provokative and impulsive, or depressive episodes where I can't even roll out of bed days at a time to do more than take a piss, throw up, and maybe force down some toast because I know I have to eat something other than vodka after four days. 

Why am I competent and intelligent in the eyes of the professionals who evaluate me, able to make my own decisions and advocate for my care sanely, but as soon as I make the mere suggestion that it is criminally unfair that I am not allowed to make a long time thought about and completely in a rational frame of mine decision that I no longer wish to endure this existence? I just think that's cruel. 

I really don't have hope. So far I haven't relapsed on opiates, but like I said, I am already drinking, so I figure it's only a matter of time. I am not a strong person and I wish to throw aside my pacifism and punch the next person who says that to me in the face. 

I am a *tired* person. 

I just don't know if things will ever get better.

Sorry this was so long, you deserve a prize if you made it this far, but just like the rest of life, you get nothing but pessimism and disappointment. 

Stay strong everyone. Be a better human than I am. Peace and love to you all <3",40,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.649266}"

Coming off 1mg medical grade Fentanyl daily was an easier kick. God DAMN that sucked. 

Thanks to everyone who tried to help, I appreciate you guys. 



OP: Hi guys, this is a bit of a long post so I'll put my main question first then my story and where I'm at below, any and all help is appreciated.

Main question: what can I take that's OTC that will reduce or preferably eliminate the hot and cold sweats? I just can't stand them, they're insanely frequently and more intense than I've ever experienced, I'm going from freezing shivering in blistering heat to literally so drenched with sweat I have to change clothes every *2-3 minutes for 30+ hours* 

Main post: 
So I'm about 36 hours into a poppy seed tea kick (hilarious, I know) and it's got me fucked. I've kicked smack, morph, Oxy, 4 years of daily Suboxone and a huge fent habit at various points of my 10 year addiction (18-28, so basically my entire adult life) but never have I experienced a withdrawal like this. 

A bit of background. 

I'm a heavy seed tea user whose also on Suboxone maintenance. I generally would buy up all the local seeds when available, have a play for three days then just jump back on subs with no issues or PWDs. 

However I recently got a bulk source for seeds where I could order 15kg of medical grade poppy seeds relatively cheap.

To a normal, relatively heavy user (400g/ 1lb daily), this is almost 30 or atleast 15 days worth of PST. It lasted me 6. I have no self control, it's that simple, I like to stay blisteringly high during all waking moments, obviously this is not feasible and resulted in my tolerance SKYROCKETING to the point that 30mg of Suboxone only made it so I wasn't shitting up my intestinal lining and vomiting up every breath of air I gulped down. 

Edit: I should also mention I'd been using for a month straight, 3-5 doses a day, usually 1lb (400g) to 700g *per* dose. At the start of the month 200g (1/2lb) was nodding me out for 4+ hours. By the end 1.5kg (3ish lbs) was giving me a light buzz that I'd go out drinking on for 10 hours without even being worried about OD. It was fucking stupid, I know, I know better, I know the pitfalls of full agonists and I did it anyway, I totally deserve this, PST has a 12hr half-life or thereabouts. I didn't *need* to dose the way I did but being the fiend I am I had to get high. Getting normal wasn't enough.

I use Suboxone in 0.25mg doses every three days while on PST, this allows me to transition immediately over to Suboxone when I want to kick, there is no issue with PWDs when I do this, provided I have a tiny dose of Suboxone active in my system I can jump on the subs without any issue except maybe a headache but I get those from subs anyway. 

So yesterday I took atleast 20mg of sub, possibly closer to 30mg, I wasn't really counting as much as just taking 2 to 4mg whenever the WDs become unbearably intense. On lower PST doses this makes the kick easily bearable. On this one it's not really doing anything at all. 

I have work in about 6 hours and I can't miss it, I need the money and I DO NOT want to use if I can avoid it. Sadly I know from experience that even massive doses of Suboxone don't really dampen the physical effects of PST, just the mental euphoria, so the desire to use is stronger than say.. a heroin kick where I know I'd need to buy an ungodly amount just to fell the lightest effect and it's not worth it. 

On hand I have: Promethazine 25mg(didn't help) Diazepam 5mg, Phenobarbital 30 & 100mg, endless amounts of Suboxone, 17 kilograms of Poppy Seed (I'd prefer not use) Pesudoephedrine 30mg, LSD, DMT and Psilocybin (though I doubt any of these will help *before* work) as well as Naproxen 250mg (but I have a stomach ulcer so these aren't something I like to take) and paracetamol/APAP. 

I have no issue taking comfort meds when kicking, it's Saturday here so I can't access the pharmacy sadly.

I plan to take a diazepam or two throughout the day in 2.5mg increments I'm aware of the risks of using benzos and have been prescribed Valium for five years without becoming physically dependent on it or abusing it heavily (I need it for my panic attacks and benzo WDs horrifies me enough to keep me from abusing these drugs)

I may be able to access Pregabalin or Orphenadrine but unlikely.

Sadly I have no DXM or Orphenadrine ATM as these are both exceptionally handy for masking opiate withdrawal.

Basically, I don't need to feel good, I just need to be able to function well enough that they won't immediately send me home sick and the shivering and sweating is extremely obvious, is there something I can take to reduce the shivers?

If nothing else works I'll take I maintenance dose of PST to subdue the WDs for work then I have the next week off to kick. But I'd rather not take any as I've already willingly spent 30+ hours in WD, I don't want that to be for nothing.

I have spastic hemiplegic CP and other issues stemming from it. It’s clear I will always have access to this medication, though I don’t believe I need it for my physical CP symptoms. 

2008-present: I didn’t graduate, failed jobs due to relapsing, 4-5 grand mal seizures (now taking Lyrica, so no longer seizing but clearly addicted to this in some way but withdrawals aren’t nearly as unbearable), unemployed due to anxiety centered around my addiction for 3 years. My partner (31 M) for 9 years is at his breaking point. I understand. His life, our life, has remained stagnant despite him excelling. But he’s still here and adamant he wants to be. We are all too often getting by the skin of our teeth financially. I’ve taken to wanting to sleep it all away. Looking at my past and what I’ve done makes me want to curl up in a ball and numb again. I don’t know if I can recover from the shitty things I’ve done for Tramadol. 

Any help sourcing Zoom meetings specific to Tramadol/opioids is greatly appreciated. I’m in the southern US. Even just to point me in the right direction is immensely helpful. I feel directionless.

My wife left. Told me by email. She’s convinced I’m still using. She’s endured a lot over the past several years, things nobody deserves. And it’s not as though it all turned to flowers and rainbows immediately when I stopped using. Life is not a fairy tale. Yet it seemed to me, short-term work/COVID stress aside, that things were getting better, for me and for us.

She accused me of using and I got angry. It doesn’t contribute to the narrative, but it’s so fucking difficult receive those accusations. There's nothing you can say. Now you're a junkie and a lier. I don't recall my verbal response, but I'm sure it was passive-aggressive and most unpleasant. I slammed the door and left. While at work, I got an email that she was leaving.

What’s the point? Why not prefer voiding life’s pain through chemistry? Relationships and meaning, whatever abstract virtue they may have, are ephemera, a band-aid that can be ripped off any time and without warning. The trust from which meaning flourishes is seamlessly dashed.

Both times were from stuff I got from a different guy than my usual. The first time I was reckless and did too much but the second time I thought I was being careful and obviously I wasn't. I could look at that in 2 ways. One would be that I should only see my normal guy. Two and the smarter idea is that I don't do dope again. It sucks that my first thought is that I need to stick to my normal guy and not think I can handle something new as well as I can handle what I'm used too. After the first time I was clean for a bit but then started picking up from my guy. Then I remembered how strong the other guys stuff was and ended up grabbing more from him even though that was the same dope I ODed on. Of course I thought that I knew now and would know how much I could handle. Obviously that was not the case. The second time was way worse too. It took me so much longer to come out of it let alone the embarrassment of that happening twice in the same month after I told everyone, ""I learned my lesson from the first time.

As if I didn't before I know now that I have a problem. Things that bother me though are that a person I used to use with does the same shit and longer than me without ever overdosing. He claims that he's accepted this lifestyle and will continue for the rest of his life. He's selfish and someone that is better off not in my life but after I overdosed the first time I let him know and said that he should be safe and that it would be nice to get clean together. He responded by telling me he's been clean for long stretches and likes living as an addict better. Also that I am a shitty junkie and always tough to deal with and messy and reckless and a whole bunch of shit that boiled down to: ""you're a shitty junkie and a shitty person, I'm a functional addict and can maintain this forever.""

I cut him out of my life but it makes me sad and angry that someones response to their ""friend"" ODing is to tell them they were just a shitty user that fucked up and I'm better at this. No support no nothing. It was a terrible feeling. I get support elsewhere which is nice but the sad part is nobody can keep that shit up forever and it really made me see how lost or dumb this guy is to think that you can just do this drug forever. If not ODing you just start to look like shit. Obviously he has no job and spends everyday middle manning for people.

Sorry for the long ramble that isn't really recovery related. I just had to get it off my chest to people that were clean or trying to be instead of people that are still in it like r/opiate.

Does loperamide, apart from giving constipation, help for wd at doses 4-6 mg?

Does 10/20 mcg of lsd help mental wd?

I've been trying to quit off and on for about two months now, and I always end up going back. Each time I lose more and more of my soul. I'm spending money I don't have and time I don't have on a substance that doesn't even do anything for me...  When I get high now all I do is sit and nod off on my bed for hours and then cry for hours more because I know I'm wasting my life. 

Gonna try and quit again in a few days... I say a few days because this time I'm going to go to an inpatient detox and then do inpatient treatment. This sub has helped me more than y'all know... I need some stories of motivation right now so I know I'm not alone. 

This is the first time I've actually been afraid of my usage. Guys, I'm scared that if I don't stop soon I'm going to die. I don't think I want to be another sad story or a RIP on someone's facebook wall... Then again I'm so depressed these days that I almost welcome it. I'm real low you guys. I'm so sad and defeated and I don't know why I keep using but I haven't been able to let go.

After all, people don’t share in those places to talk about how much fun it was. Anyway, I’m four days clean off subs after using them for eight weeks, following a five month relapse. The truth is aside from having trouble sleeping and general fatigue, I feel fine. This morning out of curiosity I was googling suboxone detox timelines and even worse, the horrific personal accounts people post, and just reading the shit literally made me feel sick and start second guessing how my own body feels. Obviously I immediately regretted it. Now I’m perseverating on this as if I’m gonna suddenly break out in severe WD’s. Just for the record I was at one point on subs for 6 years from 2009 to 2015 so I’m pretty well versed in how this works and still just reading this stuff (a lot of which is absolute bullshit) really gets in my head. I suppose I should have taken that advice, but since I didn’t it’s important to remember how powerfully the mind lies to us especially when it comes to getting clean and our expectations of how it’s gonna go, I mean how many times have we been dope sick as fuck but the second the plug says he’s pulling up we miraculously feel better before even using the dope? I guess it works both ways sometimes.",65,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75357944}"

My friends and family aren't addicts, or at least not junkies. I don't wanna depress them and I'm so used to hiding shit anyway. I've sort of been losing touch with the fellowship because I felt too guilty rocking up high. I went to a meeting today and someone shared about how they'd been in and out of the rooms since they were 20 and now they're 55 and finally getting clean. It made me feel like maybe that'll be me.

I know what I need to do, which is stay off drugs, go to meetings and put one tiny fucking blip of an effort into my life but I won't do it. I just keep relapsing. I'm on day 2 of naltrexone. Really hoping the 3 day buffer can help me reign in the spastic maniac that operates my brain.

The reason I'm coming to reddit is because I have another abscess. I'm stuck shooting pills and missing a  shot is almost automatically an abscess. I have access to wheel filters but I keep reaching for the same 600 year old needles and just assuming it'll be fine, which it's obviously not. I can't treat the abscess because I have no money, and an exam tomorrow so I can't afford to waste time in the hospital. Student health can hopefully sort me out with some free antibiotics after the exam.

Can anyone relate to how I feel? I'm shouting into the void here. 

Do I even belong in recovery spaces if I'm still this much of a loose unit? Do I belong on this sub? 

I have a sponsor but I barely talk to her. I'm half way through step 1 and I've lost momentum. Why can't I try? Am I scared of fucking up? Am I scared of succeeding? Do I just not care?

Mind you, I believed in this stuff but I thought it was meant for the 'God people': special people, I thought, that could make contact with God, feel the holy spirit, whatever - but that just wasn't me.
