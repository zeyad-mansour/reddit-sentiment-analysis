2021-03-30 14:53:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mgn4yo/negative/,Negative.,"I posted on the Opiates Recovery site too and am going to do so here in the hope that someone can help me as I'm absolutely distraught.

I am an old lady now, been on opiates for 25 years maybe a bit more. It started to rule my life. I work on a farm with the horses but suffer from chronic pain - old old riding injuries, lots of broken bones etc. I have a thing where I cannot bear even the skin to be touched on one of my shoulders from an old injury where I came off a horse and hurt it.

Anyhow. Decided to give in to my Dr and Pharmacist re the Opiates and agreed to stop. I was referred to the local Drug and Alcohol service. I spent the entire first assessment in tears at what my life seemed to have come to.

I have given a few urine samples and 3 have come back negative for Opioids. Maybe 4 can't remember my memory is not what it was.

They think I have been 'diverting' my meds.
I wouldn't even know how to go about it.

 My script is stopped and I am worried because I also have a heart condition for which I take Isosorbide and Nitroglycerin Spray. I am already becoming anxious because I know I'm heading for withdrawals and I feel so upset and distressed.

 I have been told to ring the Drug and Alcohol service tomorrow morning which I will do but my health provider seems to think that they won't want to help me now either.

Can this ever happen? I am at a total loss as to why the opioids aren't showing in my pee tests. It has been such a big thing for me to even go and access the service and I feel so upset at being thought a liar to the health provider and now these people too.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.93980086}"

However like an idiot I thought I could keep a casual once every two weeks use, then a once a week, once every three days, and then I had to take it daily because I started to get withdrawal in the off days. 

Since then I've been trying to quit and tried tapering but just don't have the self control I had last year(because I didn't have any money to buy more). Last night I made a decision to just quit and use codeine as a replacement without tapering the dhc first. So I threw away to the toilet my remaining dhc. It was hard, I had never throw it away before, always just wait for it to finish to start tapering or quiting.

I figured out it's just a week that is not even gonna be that bad because I have codeine to help supress some of the symptoms, so I just did it. I can't continue being a failure. I have to quit for good this time...",14,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6203659}"

2021-03-30 05:51:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/mgcc11/you_are_a_success_not_a_failure_youre_winning/,"You are a success, not a failure. You're winning. Addiction lost. Love yourself, you're doing awesome. I'm so proud of you! Thank you for choosing life, for choosing love.","It's tempting to feel like a failure when getting sober because, well, you did spend a lot of your life using drugs. And all the other stuff that comes along with that fact. But you're here. You made it. That's all the proof you need. So Be a success, own it. FUCK YEAH I DID IT! Not that people who die ARE failures, but that the intrusive thought that YOU're a failure is always a lie and should never be taken seriously, no matter what your ""past"" was like. It's all about perspective, the way you tell your story to others should be the way you tell it to yourself in your own mind, if you're sober right now your story is a success story, no catch, no exceptions. Own it. Congratulations. That's fucking awesome.

 Like everyone I've ever told ""I'm sober"" or ""I survived opiate addiction"" to or ""I was an alcoholic and almost died"", they're always SOOOO supportive, and always, ALWAYS, know someone who didn't make it, who actually died, and they're almost always overcome with emotion and compassion for me and so glad to see a SUCCESS in this world, to see something positive and beautiful.  I can tangibly feel their sincere gratitude that I AM a success, because I didn't let addiction Kill me, that I'm standing in front of them. You're whole life has lead up to this moment, think of all your fallen friends and artistic influences who's lives did not lead up to this, think of all the people who wanted them so badly to make it to where you already are, think of the suffering person you were who wanted nothing more than to make it to this moment, to say: I made it, I did it, I'm here, I'm fine, it's OKAY, finally.. And by living you honor them all, and you honor that person you were who wanted this so badly. Don't let that person's suffering be in vain. This is profound. Don't downplay how momentous an accomplishment it is to make it to one day sober, 2 days, 3 days... 

 So I can't sleep and have been barely sleeping the last 3 or 4 days, and that's OK, because instead of laying there and letting my thoughts do a pointless negative loop in my head, I'm watching anime, commenting on posts, and writing this right now. I'm off everything, including weed, no comfort meds (I used the 20 valium I got  for withdrawls in a few days of course). So I got nothing. Except I have everything, as I believe everything is within and being sober allows you access to that everything you are, even if you don't feel it yet, it's coming. I was sober for 2 years so I know it's coming and it's there, you've just been cut off from it, from your pure self.

 It's over. I""m just done now, with looking outside myself, I'm at the point of no return and that all addicts fear at some point. Jumping. I've done it before so I know this place I'm in and it's not forever. And I thought about getting some pot to comfort me and ""help me sleep"" but, for me, this time, I'm not going to do it that way, I'm going to try something new. I'm just not going to give in, because I do have that choice, I'm not going to put it off. I'm going to go through it. And it will pass. I'm not going to go buy tramadol (which I could do as I am in a country where it is OTC right now) to ""wean"" or ""taper"". I don't need it and I know it, I'm not in danger, I'm just uncomfortable, and that's not an excuse to risk my life. Because if I drink now, or get benzos, or even smoke pot, I could lose control and that could be it.  I'm just going to let my body heal and adjust with time and support.. And it will. It is. 

And so the biggest challenge is to keep my thoughts positive and loving towards my self and to believe this will get easier and better as it goes, as uncomfortable as it is to be coming off opiates and not able to sleep, it is still SO MUCH better than the hell of addiction or how it felt the first day, or second day.. I'm one week in off opiates. Two days off pot. I didn't sleep last night, it's 5 am, but I'm not a failure, and I'm not going to give up. And I'll get my precious sleep eventually, and when it comes I'll be so grateful I waited.

That’s all I really wanna do in this moment. So I decided to make this post to hopefully take the power out of it.

I rewrote the lyrics to that little melody though, as I sit out on my driveway and smoke... hence my title.

Tbh, I don’t know how I feel. I don’t know who I am without getting high. And like, the really stupid part about it all is I’m sitting here romanticizing my use... when I was so fucking unhappy the whole time, even when I was high. I had no one. I have so many friends now, both ones I lost because they couldn’t watch anymore, and some new ones that I’ve met in recovery.

My life is fucking fantastic. I’ve developed so much in such a short amount of time, like I’ve been in the hyperbolic time chamber or something (it’s from dragonball Z, in case ya didn’t get the allegory just Google it, this post is already boutta be hella long so I don’t wanna explain here but yea ☺️). I went from junkie to manager in literally 3 weeks, I have my own spot with super chill roommates. I’m back on my meds for my bipolar disorder and what do you know, when I’m not fucking around with drugs they actually seem to be working.

But still.... the darkness is hungry for me. It calls to me, whispering “don’t you remember how good I made you feel, all that time?”. It’s a lie, and rationally I know that. But in my heart, I fucking love dope. I fucking miss the *nothingness*. I started using when I was 13 years old, so really at 24 I don’t know who the *fuck* I am without them.

I became so comfortable in being numb that feeling anything became torture. Which is so *baffling*, because really: life is so beautiful when I have the blessing of being *present*. I guess I just gotta train my eyes on everything I have in my life today that I would never have if I was using, even if my brain screams constantly about what’s missing without the high.

Sorry for the word vomit, but if you can’t tell, I needed to get this shit out.

Hope all is well with everyone here. We can do this. Let’s run faster than the demons who scream we deserve to burn. 

Even though so much of me simply just believes them, there is a tiny, tiny sliver that whispers to me soothingly *”babydoll you never needed them”*.

I have attended behavior therapy the whole time on suboxone. Thing is though, I feel like suboxone is ruining my marriage. My wife and toddler son are the most important things in my life and if I lose them I know I will go to a very dark place. She has the right to leave after my selfishness but she is deciding to stick with me god bless her.

On opiates I did OKAY in the bedroom, good enough to get by and please the wife, except for the occasional dick deflation when I was really high.

Suboxone, on the other hand, makes my libito dis-a-fucking-pear. I am on testosterone injections for 4 months now, because my numbers were in the double-digits and I still feel no urge to hop in bed. After 11 months, although my wife shows support, I can easily see how frustrated she is.

I want to stop everything. I want to go back to feeling good without chemicals inside me. I want to drop this extra 80 lbs that the drugs have put on me. I want to be able to jump on the trampoline with my 3 year old without going out of breath in 2 minutes.

I'm not going to pretend that there is a miracle cure for withdrawals. I am prepared to go through some pain and aching, non sleeping and aggitation. Guys, I want this now more than ever.

My questions:

1. At what rate should I reduce and by how much? Currently taking 8mg per day.

2. Will Klonopin help with sleep and is it something that won't form another easy habit? What are good temporary crutch meds? Will my PCP give me sedating-type meds while on subs?

3. Is there a guide that has been somewhat proven to follow with dropping subs?

4. Stupid question time. (Alternatively) With a much shorter half life, is it easier to crutch on oxy until subs are out and then detox from oxy using subs to microdose for a few days? I thought I read somewhere that this was a promising tactic.

This is a story about my addiction. I shared this addiction with my parents. Addiction wasn't always a part of our lives. We had family reunions, lived on a farm of 30 acres, participated in horse shows, went camping together, had family dinner together. In the end, we lost everything. Our home, values, loved ones, and even ourselves. Our addiction tore us apart from the inside out. But today, after many tribulations, I have over 3 years clean.

I got honest with myself and admitted to myself I traded one addiction for another. Instead of getting opiates from doctors or off the streets I started what for me was a very convenient MAT program, so.....I told myself I am managing my addiction, all the while abusing take home doses, buying extra methadone. I finally got honest with myself and decided this is not who I want to be. I do not want to manipulate myself, lie to myself, I got angry at my 20 plus year addiction and deciding to quit CT, I have been doing the vitamin C megadose process for withdrawls. I was skeptical but willing to try anything because withdrawls have always kept me so terrified of getting clean. I started taking 3 to 4 gms 3 days prior to jumping off, then 4 to 5 grams every 2 to 3 hours. I swear it works. Big pharma, rehabs, doctors, etc have kept this secret from those in detox. It is a miracle, I am relieved of 90% of my withdrawl symptoms. I take magnesium when needed for RLS. I am able to sleep and not sweat and not feel overly anxious or agitated. I do have a little depression but believe it is situational and will pass however if it does not, I will see a therapist once I am out of the woods. I am on day 5 with almost no discomfort. I know detox is only the start, I have a long way to go and welcome suggestions. This is my first time truly WANTING to get sober.

I'm having huge struggles with staying sober.
I don't know how to keep myself motivated.

The main reason I want to quit at the moment is because I need more money. I mean, I still work full time (I'm very good at my job), I don't have any friends to not see or hurt with my use, when I use, I'm still able to function (I never get high enough to stop being able to do things), I still eat, talk to my family daily (they live in a different country and don't know about my habit).. it's just me being broke and that causing stress.
However, as soon as pay day comes around, I'm not broke.. until I get on a few times, which makes me broke again and the cycle continues.

I read that methadone WD peaks at 96-144 hours with physical WD lasting up to 2 weeks as well as dysphoria, irritability, insomnia, fatigue as long as 8 months to 2 years after.  I made the decision to start tapering so when I do quit the WD hopefully won’t be so bad. Ive been going down 1mg every two weeks, and as of right now I am at 14mgs. I am already starting to feel stomach cramps in the morning that wakes me up around 6 am everyday and extreme depression and anxiety and emotional mood swings. How low should I get before I stop? Should I taper a little faster to get it over with? I have a little Xanax , gabapentin, and ondansetron to help get over the worst parts.

To anyone just starting out, don't sweat it. 
Realize every second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, it gets easier. 

I know every situation is different and there are people who are much deeper than I ever was, but i'd strongly suggest you white knuckle it as much as possible. I know this is counter to what many suggest here, but honestly i'm so, so, so glad I did. It made the acute recovery process hurt a lot more than it could have, but that pain becomes a very strong tool moving forward. Additionally, and most importantly it was the desire to be totally clean and free from substance that ultimately made me decide not to pursue Suboxone or other aids. I'm very glad my doctor wouldn't prescribe it until I had been clean for a full week. 

Also, be as active as you possibly can be. This is easier said than done but there is a reason so many people suggest it. It accellerates the healing process immensely. Just going for a walk, anything to get yourself moving.

Initially, finding a way to burn time and keep yourself occupied from whatever agony you're experiencing. For some that's video games or a hobby. I found that watching television really didn't work because it wasn't engaging my attention.

Longer term, after acute phase, I found that staying active as much as possible really helps. This isn't difficult for some people who work regular jobs or have families as you're forced into action. Do as much as you can as often as you can. Exhaust yourself.

In the future, months down the line, you'll start feeling pretty good and it is at this point where the most dangerous temptation comes. You're in a better space and feel like you could possibly have another dance. Step back and recognize that moment as one of your final tests. It's an easy test to pass, as you literally have to do nothing. Just don't do it.

I am in a unique position that kind of really sucks. I dug my own hole and will get myself out but its been tough. 


In my journey to get sober from opiates I quit smoking weed(and alcohol) and memories started coming back. 


Extreme neglect, gaslighting, verbal abuse and witnessing physical abuse before the age of 12.


Has led to me having an extreme disassociation to the point of my brain rewiring itself to just survive.(from age 8-17+) So quitting opiates has been very difficult as I finally realized the narccicists I live with won't change, I must change so I am not like them.


They lovebomb, judgement, shame and verbally abuse me still. Even though I have shared a lot about my recovery, they still do not trust me(understandably) and I am sober from opiates which I used for many years but their view is:


They did not slap or punch so it is not abuse. I brought up that they treat noone with respect and am told that is how I deserve to be treated and that since I didn't pay for all of the rent for my entire life anything is allowed, like I am a puppet they can mistreat. 


I bring up I'd like to not be yelled at, and they deny reality claiming they aren't yelling. Anytime something happens yelling occurs over the tiniest thing. You put a dirty dish next to the sink, yelling. you put leftovers in the fridge, yelling. You put away something in the wrong place you didn't know existed, yelling. You move anything, you will be punished.


I ask them to stop yelling at me again, they yell even louder, get upset like a child, and run away making shaming snide comments along the way. Then let me have it even worse the next
opportunity they have.


I have finally realized my parents were contributing to my failure all along just as much or even more than I was from being the worst parents possible for 18 years. 
When I went to highschool and couldn't afford to buy and eat lunch and had to skip lunch every day that was NEGLECT! I truly thought it was my
own fault for being bad all the time and thought that about everything for my entire life. Its just weird. But I made it sober; today was my biggest trigger, the worst thing possible to happen, and I didnt run to drugs, I just lifted weights and laughed at the insanity...

She def effects me though. Long story short career loss and whatever lead me to relapse about 6 months later. Told her I was struggling and she almost left but stayed.  

The whole relationship I’ve felt so strongly about her, so attracted, our dynamic is awesome, physical attraction, everything.  I love her.  I put a lot into it and have relapsed on multiple occasions due to me feeling “not cared for enough” or just like felt the distance, she can’t dive into and help me overcome anything, it’s usually like if I have to speak about something I’ll get an “it’ll be okay honey” followed by def a bit of awkwardness showing she really don’t wanna deal.  Ive made dumb decisions based off feelings I’ve had off reacting to her.  I’ve bottled up a lot of shit about substance and how I feel to keep her comfortable but lowkey struggling myself. The happiness was leaving, she was losing patience but not really doing much, I wasn’t doing shit other then tryna stay clean til next time I got upset. Bad cycle

Covid lockdowns and sh it happened making us distance more around may 2020 we ended things, got back tg for a month in June but we’re finished by July.  I got clean fully in august, met a great girl who I am def not as attracted too lol, and felt just not completely right spending time with her, but she has helped me eons more than my ex and she honestly is the most selfless person ever and I love her in a diff way.  Honestly wish I wasn’t shallow off looks and would end up with her lol....few months go by

Dec 2020 ex reaches out, me and the other girl are actually on a break cuz in opposite fashion of my ex she’s very overbearing and clingy lol.  Me and ex start dating, taking things slow, I get sick with COVID, she’s slammed with work and school. We fight a lot usually about how I feel like she’s not giving effort; if she’s distant for a few days cuz school and work, she’ll usually acknowledge and apologize for being busy or not making time, if I take it farther, it’s flipped on me and I’m the asshole.  She usually has to shoot down plans with me cuz obligationsand I understand, but regardless I’m alone 6/7 days a week lol, and I’m kinda in something I want more out of. 

So 3 months later after getting back and were watching videos on her phone, she gets a private message on social media of a guy reacting to her post, she gets up and is honest saying that was the guy that she was involved with during our breakup. I took it not great because I figured guy would be blocked, but nah he wasn’t.  I reacted and was upset; she understood but once I dragged it out and said some things she didn’t like she kinda ended things lmao or def indicated things aren’t working (every time something would come up she’d try to leave or end things, like mostly) 

So Sunday was the last straw and I gave in, drank heavy, somehow got my hands on fentanyl and did about a bag before I was so fucked up I dropped the other 3, didn’t even go back, I relapsed on one bag lol, scraped my car on a guardrail.. what a fucking mess. 

Anyway I called my therapist got in touch with some ppl and shit, but common denominator here, this girl seems like she is emotionally unavailable especially for someone with a little baggage like me, I may just need more from someone?  We’re giving some space and will speak most likely this week sometime.  I’m not sure how she feels cuz this time I really did give effort, I was different and willing to live and she was jam packed and it caused some waves, and me needing some support here and ther and her being busy just constantly reminded me of what we lacked, I’m guessing me arguing with her did the same to her.

So Im new to this page as Ive recently discovered that my mother is using drugs again. Some background info: She lost custody of my sister and I about 6 years ago for a crack/cocaine addiction,she went to therapy and seemed okay for a while. Shes been through a lot of traumatic things from abusive relationships,loss and mental issues such as anxiety,PTSD,and depression. She was living out of state from me until about a year and a half ago and moved here to be close to my sister and I again. She was doing good,got established,regained her drivers license. 

Flash forward to last summer: She was drinking a lot,and was surrounding herself with people who just weren’t good people. My Mom has a habit of wanting to fix or help others but not herself. One of these people had a lot of problems mentally and told me that he witnessed my Mom snorting white powder off of her dresser (not sure if it was her pain pills or cocaine). I brushed it off because the guy was pretty out there and my Mom said he had lied because she wasn’t friends with him anymore(mind you she worked with this guy at a restaurant). She was fired a few weeks later and claimed her boss said customers had complained about her and he didn’t need her there(dick move right?-because I know my Mom was an awesome server). About a month later at my Moms birthday dinner out at a restaurant she showed up belligerent,drunk drove,along with a female friend of hers. They both were obviously high off of weed and drunk,but my Mom was a mess,and the way she was acting wasn’t just from smoking pot/drinking. My sister and I noticed she had white powder in her nose (when addressed my Mom denied and said it was baby powder that got on her face/nose-I was mad because I knew she lied but gave her the benefit of the doubt and knew hanging onto anger wasnt healthy and my hands were tied). 

Flash forward to the past couple months:
My Mom was doing okay,and even started coming to church with me and seemed to be getting into it. About a month or so later she became friends with a woman who had become homeless (had a whole backstory my Mom let her stay with her-she had mental issues and now I realize she was an addict). My Mom said she thought this lady was cursed and that some very strange things occurred (this lady would pull her hair out and say it felt like someone was braiding her hair,her voice would change-that she felt weird). Now my Mom being the person she is wanted to help her and was pretty worked up over this and convinced herself that this lady had a demon inside of her. She made the lady leave and had her house blessed (the 5 people who blessed her house said they didnt feel any presence). Things were fine for a couple weeks,my Mom came to church with me again and said she had found the Lord,meant a lot to me to hear that. I got married and she threw me my bridal shower and things seemed ok. Now after a couple weeks,she started saying there was something in her house,lost her new job from acting “aggresively at work” and claimed the demon that was in her friend mustve jumped into her. I asked her if maybe it could just be her anxiety,and her being alone in her apartment affecting her since she doesnt like being alone;she got angry and said I didnt understand and was convinced there was something in her. About a week went by and I hadnt heard from my Mom, which was strange. I called and she didnt answer and I stopped by because I was worried. She was home and had a guy there(he seemed pretty out there-she said he was a friend of her old female friend who had stayed with her before) turns out this guy was staying with her because she was scared to be alone. A couple days ago I get a call from my sister,my Moms neighbor had messaged her saying my Mom was taken by the police at 11am on Monday. Long story short my Mom had knocked on her neighbors door the night before and told her she was scared,asked to go look in her neighbors bathroom and then left. Her neighbor was half asleep and didnt really think too much into it but thought it was strange. The next morning my Mom buzzed her neighbors bell to get into the building and had 3 cops with her,my Mom had called the police saying there was someone in her apartment. The police went inside,said there was no one. My Mom told her neighbor and one of the officers that demons were following her and that the cops were fake and were going to kill her and to call 911. She got upset and the police took her to the hospital to get a psych eval. When her neighbor told us this she said her apartment was left unlocked her lights were still on and her kitten was still there alone. My husband and I went over to get the cat after hearing what happened and to close up the apartment,we got inside and her apartment was a disaster(hole in the wall in the bathroom,towels stuffed into the hole,cabinet was off,towel rack yanked out of the wall,etc. my husband walked into my Moms bedroom while I called my Sister to update her. He came out and was holding a pipe(we initially thought was for crack but now know it was for crystal meth). We called the police and an officer came and had me give him the pipe,he said the initial report noted they had seen drug paraphernalia in her unit and he was going to dispose of it. I asked if she was going to get charged and he said no because they couldn’t prove it was hers just that it was in her possession (still don’t understand why she wasn’t charged). I called the hospital and she was admitted,they couldn’t tell me anything because of HIPPA and my Mom signed the paper to not disclose her medical info with anyone. I asked to speak with my Mother and got through,she said she didnt remember any drug stuff being in her apartment,that she was framed and the guy drugged her and she heard him talking on the phone about framing her and that this is what “they” want-they being these “demons” for us to think she was using again and to think she had mental issues. She shared with me that the doctor told her she had opiod(her pain med),narcotic(one of her other meds),alcohol,weed and amphetamine in her blood. She denied anything with the pipe and still is saying days later she was framed and that theres a demon inside of her. She is being released today and Im a whirlwind of emotions,I dont want her to do this again and continue doing drugs or harm herself or others. 

My purpose in sharing that is for advice because as being her daughter its really affected my life and emotions. I realize now after talking to my sister that my Moms probably been back into drugs since last summer and was in a drug induced psychosis due to everything in her system. I love my Mom but I cant handle her heavy denial,lifestyle and lies anymore. She swore left and right that she didnt do any drugs that she was drugged by this guy and shes innocent.

Notorious J U N K I E. The only label at the end that really fit me. Lost so lonely, foolish illusions. Praying before every hit that that one would take me out, cuz I couldn’t stand to do the math and find out just how many days of my life I wasted, always, always empty (still can’t). Present in body, insane in mind, and utterly devoid in spirit, love, or soul.

I write this as a warning, to the addict who has just picked up their first Percocet, with no idea how tangled this trapeze act can get. Especially once you become so entirely desolate that you actively swing over and over again- and intentionally do so without a net. 

That absolute peace? That lack of any of the pain you can’t remember not having possessed? Imagine the antithesis. Imagine passing out all day and still never getting rest. Picture in your mind’s eye if you can, the most stereotypical opiate addict without a fix- the puking and the never ending cold sweats. Now, picture in your soul... a feeling infinitely worse than that.

As my title says, I won’t pretend that I don’t love the dope. But that doesn’t mean that I recommend walking up to a fucking grizzly bear with a rod of fire and deciding it’s a good idea to *poke poke poke*. In fact, I greatly advocate against it. Because maybe- just maybe though, let me be clear about that- if I never tasted Percocet, I never would have tasted heroin, and if I never tasted heroin, I never, ever would have tasted fent. That shit killed my baby sis, my very fucking *BEST FRIEND*. 

But I was too far gone to even consider not taking a step over the boundary I set for myself when she overdosed. And it’s not like I wasn’t already on dope, I’d made friends with black long before. All it took though, after I could only get half well off of the H, was for my plug to say “are you *sure* you don’t want to try a little bit?”

I’ve said before in one of my posts on that *”I felt the one and only creator of the universe serenade me to sleep.”* I would like to retract that statement, absolutely- you see, that is what the evil I let inside of me lied to me and said. Then it went and used my body as a vessel to express that sentiment of deceit so that perhaps since I said it rather poetically.... the darkness could move through the conduit it found within me, and make even just one more person believe that it was the truth. 

You want to know the truth? I’ll tell you. It. Gets. Much. Worse. And I know it gets even worse than the many rings of hell that I have personally seen. Every moment of bliss you will find is only the most convincing of tricks being played on your mind. And the moment you’re in just deep enough that you no longer need completely opaque shades of wool pulled over your eyes... you will realize, that you had no idea what you were doing. 

Then later, you will realize that you had no idea what you would go on to do.

I implore you... infinity is not a concept that goes well with humanity. Get out while it’s still a little simple. Opiates, in my opinion, are such fucking beautiful monsters that I think if you’ve got the taste for them... well one taste is enough that getting out would rarely be described as simple. That is,  if you were truly honest with yourself. With one step into hell... you’ll have the burn scars forever, however: they will only be up to your ankles.

I’ll close with this though, there’s always hope, no matter if you just took your first Norco or if you’re nodding out reading this with a needle sticking out of your arm. 

I am (by the grace of many forgiving angels) living proof. I relapsed since my last post on this sub, but I have 10 days clean today.

My sister still calls me a horrible liar for 2 years ago when I lied and said I hadn’t relapsed. My mom screams at me for smoking medical marijuana that several doctors recommended and screened me for and prescribed because I used in the past. Despite me being an adult who is rapidly approaching several years clean.

They both ignore all the progress I’ve made and it hurts. It puts me in an extremely bad headspace to hear them yell and scream at me as thought I just used before talking to them. It’s not that they are still dealing with feelings about it it’s that they haven’t dealt AT ALL since it happened despite me doing hundreds of hours of rehab and therapy and hospitalizations to prove to them I was taking it seriously and recovering. 

I can’t even share clean time with them and celebrate because I’m told it’s not enough. It’s never enough. I feel like I’m never gonna be good enough. 

At this point I’ve cut off from them saying they need to deal with their baggage before screaming at me again. I put my foot down. I said that I had to seek help for this and that they should too because I can’t be their therapist. They will get mad and say they shouldn’t have to because this is my fault that they are upset but ya know they’ve done shit that made me upset and need to seek therapy throughout my life so. I guess we are even.

Not just mentally, but physically as well. I started finding motivation when about 2 months ago. I was on opiates (just H at this point) and now lighter doses of benzos cause it took an OD to realize 4mg is too far. But one night after doing a few too many bumps of H and still mixing xanax I spilled a gram and a half of H that I spent my final dollars on, and journaled a whole 2 pages that I didn’t even remember. At this point I had no funds to buy H. I ran out of “items” I was flipping, I had no source of income, and I had nothing of value to sell. So I began cold turkey withdrawals. After a week of hell and not eating, playing video games, and smoking bud, I stepped on the scale. Prior to this, a month ago I was the heaviest ever in my life, 238lbs. I was 225 when I stepped onto it this day, and I had to step on 5 more times to ensure the scale wasn’t broken! It motivated me like never before, I started heating up .99 cent bags of veggies and chicken munching throughout the day. Every day I’ve woken up with a whole different vibe! I went to journal about my new found joy and saw the two pages I wrote when I was high on H and Xanax. It was sad but awakening because although I was detached from reality when I wrote it, I still wrote about being tired of waiting on plugs, the sketch places I went, being broke, and I wrote about how opiates aren’t worth it anymore. I wrote about how I hated how quick my tolerance would shoot up so now I’m spending twice as much next week, how withdrawals felt when the plug was MIA, how I couldn’t go eat with friends cause I picked a bag of H. It made me want to save up and do life right this time! I had a mushroom experience a few days ago and it improved progression! I re-accessed myself. I realized all I did was take the easy way out of every situation and I’m done with that shit. I’m trying to focus on my passion more and build an instagram I can sell in the future, I’m reading more, meditating to help take control of my mind and constant negative thoughts, I truly had a wake up and I’m not looking back. Relapse is an every day battle and don’t feel guilty if you make a mistake, just learn. It’s not necessary but I do take half an adderall rarely to knock out a lot of work and push myself in my cardio, but I made 4 last 2 weeks. I can’t wait for what’s in store for my future!!!

Next day I horked a 3 cubic foot wet bag of compost and awoke with what I believed to be a kidney stone.  

I had pain that made me go blind a couple of times waves of nausea.  I took ibuprofen black seed oil and even some kratom (which is only for big pain also have a strict policy to never dose more than once a day after withdrawal both ways only onc a day sucks but bareable). Nothing helped.   

After 2 hours of blinding pain I called the ambulance yup couldn't even drive myself.  Couldn't take it anymore.  

When the paramedics arrives I am screaming NO OPIATES I NEED 6 YEARS AT LEAST BROTHERS! Told every nurse and medic that would hear me I can't have that will ruin my life. Doctor came in an appreciated my strength but since I had stomaches pain too they offered Dilaudid.  I told him I needed 6 years at least before I even thought about pain relief and I didn't want to start over.

I felt I was being tested I can't tell you how or why or as many times as I have thought this but this time does feel different.  I have it stuck in my head I need 6 years to reset myself and even then idk.  Opiates: she is a cold sneaky little bitch that fucking looooooaaves to chip away at my soul.  

 Doctor injected toredol and acetaminophen.  Took the edge off but it still effin hurt. I am grateful because this morning I may be in a different place.  I'm in pain still but very grateful that I don't also have that sneaky bitch on my back.   

I feel so bad everyone heard me screaming and I was cussing God out so bad.  I say again I didn't mean it I was just in pain.  I puked several several times from the pain alone.   I did not know pain like this existed.  

The pain was a reminder to take better care of my body.  I am getting old.  In a few years I will be a 40 old bird.  We only have today.  I am so grateful for the pain.

I just got diagnosed with PTSD from surviving COVID in December. The anxiety is horrible and the depression is back with a strength that I haven’t felt since I first quit dope back in 2019. That real dark, heavy, soul crushing kind of depression that makes you lie on the floor for days. I’m barely sleeping an hour a night and when I do sleep I am screaming and crying so it’s not restful. 

I’ve been through a lot the last few months. But I went through it and am continuing to go through it WITHOUT using fentanyl — or any painkiller. I can’t even recall having any real cravings for it in this whole hellish time period, which is fucking amazing because there was a time where if I had the slightest problem or inconvenience I would take it as an excuse to run back and relapse. Now, the world is shattering around me half the days and I never even hear the whisper of that old voice saying “go numb yourself with drugs”. 

After basically being in a depression coma for the last week I was suddenly inspired after some medical marijuana and some long therapy sessions to make this post. Because, well....

This is real. Updates about being clean aren’t always going to be sunshine and rainbows and Everything Is Great Now! Life keeps happening. And life can be so cruel and so sad and we don’t get to change that. We just get to change how we react when life happens and I choose to not hide from this pain by killing myself from the inside out with drugs. 

And it sucks. It really sucks. I am doing worse right now than I have since getting through withdrawal and it hurts and I’m so scared and sad and I feel like there’s glass in my skin most of the time and I feel like I can’t breathe or that I’m suffocating and sometimes even raising my arm to check the time feels like a daunting task that leaves me drained and empty. But. 

I’m not going to use. I’m going to stay clean, and I’m going to get through this. I am going to live. I am going to remember how to be human again without running back to what once stole my soul.

I'm attempting to get clean, properly, for the first time in 4 years. I'm currently 6 days off using (this has a lot to do with having no money until next week, which is why I want to get some support before pay day) and I still have my methadone to keep my body from falling to pieces.

I live in Australia and am looking to start going to some virtual meetings (there aren't any f2f near me), but I was wondering if there are any online support group chats or anything similar?

I just want to have a group of people who know what I'm going through, that I can message for advice, or when I'm feeling bad, and they can do the same with me, without the pressure of having to always reply, but just when they feel like it.

I don't want a one on one chat, that feels like I'd be too responsible for helping them all the time, which I might not be able to do if I'm going through my own shit, and also, I wouldn't want to let them down if I slip up, so if it's a group situation, I think it'd be a bit easier on my anxiety.

Anyway, any and all info would be greatly appreciated.

Lots of love and well wishes,

The rest is mostly a blur due to the concussion,confusion, the bizarre state of mind I was in considering I had just overdosed for the first time. But I will never forget what the paramedic said to me next, “Hey brother, someone or something must want you on this earth still, cuz your lips and face were blue and purple and you were dead, but your angel of a fiancé proceeded to hit you up with narcan until we arrived. You would be dead if it weren’t for her.”

No words were able to form in my mouth. I just broke down emotionally and mentally. At 33 yrs old and after 17 yrs of struggling with addiction-getting clean for multiple years and relapsing-over and over and OVER...and surviving through that cycle for so long, I had finally overdosed. I had raised the white flag of surrender before sooooo many times but this one felt different on so many levels. There is no doubt that i will be dead very soon if I continue this cycle-and I want so much more for my life.

The paramedics proceeded to ask me their standard questions which seemed so difficult to answer due to the shock and awe moment of things. As they strapped me to the stretcher and hauled me off to the ambulance, I started thinking and asking myself how the fuck this happened. How quickly I pissed 6 months of clean time away (for the 15th time)But most of all, I couldn’t believe how selfish I had been. I put the love of my life through such a traumatic experience because I made the decision to use one more time. My decision to use gave her a traumatic experience she will never ever forget. will she always be paranoid that this is going to happen in the future? Will this forever change our relationship and the way she views me? Only time will tell. 

I arrive at the ER and due to covid protocol none of my family or my fiancé can see me. Besides the cat scan for my head injury and the occasional nurse check in to make sure I am still breathing, I’m left alone at 3am in a hospital bed.  Just me and my thoughts and my disease of addiction. I knew I needed help and thank god I had been in recovery before so I knew who to call. 

Several hours later I was cleared to go home and I made an appointment with my addiction doctor for that day. I took the first step in getting my life back.  

It has now been 4 days since my overdose and I am now seeing life through a different lens. I’m so grateful for my loved ones and that I am being given another opportunity at life. 

Currently I’m on subutex for a rapid 2 week taper and then the goal is to get back on my Vivitrol shot as fast as possible by using the naltrexone challenge. 

I know there will be plenty of ups and downs in recovery and in life in general, but one thing I realized is that I never have to walk through anything alone. And that’s what matters most. As long as we all have our loved ones to help, communicate, walk through something with, it is possible.

I have been on probation for 10 and a half months. I have about a month and a half to go. I was really good about my probation, paid off all fees early, stayed out of trouble, had already finished IOP and was on to aftercare about a month into my probation. My only issue was work because I am diabetic and the pandemic was rough for me, as I am not well controlled. I have been very sick for almost three months, I’ve had countless Covid tests, and hospitalizations for my diabetes, I’ve had doctors appointments, and finally a positive Covid test about a month ago. It took me about three weeks to improve ( probably from my diabetes) and then I got a negative Covid screen and doctor clearance to go back to normal routines. Because of this I have not tested in three months or so. My PO has had very little contact with me but I have provided any and all documentation I’ve received and constantly asked if she needed anything extra to ask.
I’m an addict and she knows it, I was in an intervention in lieu of conviction plea deal. In the last few months I have had terrible anxiety and depression and felt so isolated being sick, and was having dreams and urges to relapse. so I reached out to an addiction clinic. They recommend using a small amount of zubsolv to treat my cravings and make it so I’m less likely to relapse.

I just started this treatment this weekend after I received my negative Covid test and was able to get my first Covid vaccine dose. I sent my PO all documentation and was honest about my urges and me seeking out to get treatment and starting medication. Well her only response was that she needs me to come in to test early tomorrow morning. She has left me feeling like I did something wrong. She didn’t acknowledge if I was allowed to be on the medication or not. She didn’t say anything about my illness. I only have a month and a half left and I don’t want this to screw it up. I’m so worried I’ve made a mistake, I just don’t know what to do. I really just want the best and safest outcome for myself. I’m worried about what I’ll do once I’m off of probation. I need advice?

Life is going ever onward. I think less and less about my addictions than I ever thought possible. I haven’t touched alcohol in just as long. My head is clear, my thoughts are my own, and I have money in the bank. Life is good. 

That last sentence was hard to say because it’s so unfamiliar to me. That thought even makes my eyes wet. I’ve learned a lot on my journey to sobriety. Life being good doesn’t have to mean it’s perfect being chief among them. Perfection is impossible. And, good can look different for us all. 

I’ve made peace with a lot of things. I’m forty one and single with no kids. And, that’s okay. I still have family and people that I love and care about that also love and care about me in return. There are times when I’m holding my six month old niece that I regret not getting to be a father. But, maybe it’s for the best that I’m not. Maybe it’s better that I don’t pass on my mental illness and addiction. I also don’t have a true career and I work an hourly job making a fifth of what my brother makes. That’s okay too. I don’t have the high stress and responsibility that he has either. I wouldn’t say that I’m happier than him, merely that I’m happier at would I do than I would be at what he does. I’m not young and nor am I immortal. Some day I will die. That’s okay as well. I’ve lived, loved, and learned. My life has been and still is full. And facing my own mortality I begin to realize that when, not if, but when my body begins to fail that there may come a time when I’m ready to go. That too is okay. Youth fades. Time moves on. It’s not the quantity of life, but the quality of it. And my quality of life is better than it’s ever been. 

I struggle less with who I am. I like myself even. I’ve found things I’m passionate about and that I deeply enjoy. I’ve found I’m more social than I once thought I was. I’ve also discovered that the things I once thought were impossible or had given up on are within reach. I can still go back to school and get a degree. I can one day buy a new car. I can one day own a home. I can forgive myself. I can be tender with myself. I can love myself. All of these are things that when I was at my lowest I thought were beyond my grasp. 

I’m not sure why I wrote this. Maybe I just wanted to order my thoughts. Whatever the reason I hope it helps someone in some way. Life can truly be better than you can imagine. You deserve another chance. You’re worth it. And, as cliche as it is...if I can do it then anyone can. Time was that I was as lost and as hopeless a soul that ever walked this earth.  But, time moves on and things can change for the better. It won’t always be easy. Lord knows I still have days where I feel overwhelmed and like a drowning man gasping for breath. But, those days are fewer and fewer. So, to whoever needs this please know and believe that it’s possible and that you’re worth it and that you deserve it.",47,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6389759}"

If you'd asked me even 2.5 months ago, which was when I started my most recent attempt at stopping using opiates I would have said I would never post about my addiction as I believed it was very unlikely that I would feel anyone could identify with my use and reasons for using. That was until I ""discovered"" Adult ADHD when I was part-way through my most recent recovery phase...I say ""discovered"" because it was mentioned as a possible diagnosis for me by the counsellor I have started working with since December 2020 via Zoom (zoom, because #pandemic). Although she didn't present it to me as anything other than a possibility, at the same time, after days of reading around the topic, if I open the floodgates about how much relief and understanding about myself and my addiction I now have as a result of her mentioning ADHD and my subsequent research into it I will be here all night, as the impact on my whole psyche has been literally mindblowing. I am now waiting for a formal mental health diagnosis for ADHD (the way that the health service works over here is that a formal diagnosis is different from a qualified person telling you they think you may have something, despite it sounding similar! And IF I am diagnosed with Adult ADHD formally I will start looking at treatment options. I honestly believe I do have ADHD and consequently, I believe that help to manage ADHD is absolutely crucial to my long-term recovery from addiction, especially as I have had a relapse since Thursday morning, while I was 70 days clean. 70 days was my longest clean stretch for many, many years.....but I have also had many more attempts, lasting anything from hours to 8 years. So I am not catastrophising over this lapse, but nor do I see an ADHD diagnosis as a magic solution; in fact I will be satisfied with a definitive diagnosis of NOT having ADHD almost as much as I will be to find out my struggles have a name and are treatable to some extent. Even if NOT having ADHD is where my journey takes me (highly, highly unlikely, to my mind currently) at least I have identified the things in my life that I struggle with and which are contributing to my use, even if they do not have the name ADHD....if that makes sense? My mental health journey has involved a lot of things (such as a very serious suicide attempt) that I have blamed on my drug addiction and what I thought was just a ""crap, useless personality"". Like I said, the thought that there may be other kinds of solution out there for me rather than just more and more ""effort"" has been seismic for my wellbeing and optimism for the future. And I will find those solutions even if I'm wrong about having ADHD. I have lost so much to my mental health condition, including a long term disability from my most recent suicide attempt.

What I would really like now, if you could find the time, is any stories on this topic at all.....from those of you who have ADHD and like me self-medicated with opiates because it seemed as though they helped alleviate certain symptoms, even whilst creating new problems. I would also especially love to hear from people who have found medication and treatment for Adult ADHD has strengthened their recovery from opiates, whatever that means to you personally. I would especially be interested to hear from long term opiate users who were not diagnosed with ADHD as a child but who have come late to an adult diagnosis (I'm in my mid to late 40s).

I would also like to reassure anyone, because I mentioned suicide in the past, that right now I am not in that space at ALL at the moment, and haven't been for over a decade. I am fully committed to my life and my recovery, but I am pleased to feel that there may be help out there for me.

This makes tapering tough although i struggle anyway with this, CT is also very tough at this level, got to 12 days or so last year but it was grim once, especially once i stopped the comfort meds after a week (pregab + benzo)

Therefore i plan to stabilise on 240mg a day and then jump off CT - i fully appreciate some grim withdrawals but hopefully not as bad as they would be if jumping off now- my question is how long do people think i need to be on 240mg for that to re-set as my ‘dose’ and for the withdrawals to reflect that level.. i’ve got as long as it takes

please, although i understand they are well meant but i am not looking for advice on alternative strategies, i can’t taper, tried a million times, i can CT as have done before, but my current dose is too much, i know dropping to 240 will also equal wds but again these won’t be as bad as CT - also in advance i know everyone is different! 😂 i am just interested in opinions",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.55025274}"

We both understand why most facilities do not allow cell phones, but he has a great job right now and will only be able to get treatment if he can contact/accept calls from his bosses/employees and make sure they continue to stay on track while he is away. Unfortunately, he will almost definitely lose his job if he just goes dark for a week. Even when we go on short vacations, his phone is always blowing up with work-related matters that he must address. We are in Detroit, Michigan and if anyone has any knowledge of where he might be able to go, we would greatly appreciate it and it would change our lives so much.

I have MAT questions,"I would have gone last year but I didn't have insurance. I managed to get clean October-december started chipping in January and things have just gotten too out of hand. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning and came into the room when I was doing my intake on the phone. She asked what I was doing and I told her I'm checking into rehab today. Her face lit up and she gave me a huge hug and said she saw proud of me.

Idk it warmed my heart because I've lied to her a lot and it's been causing a huge strain on our relationship. 

I've always been serious about getting Clean and I've tried. I've really tried. But it's just been so hard. I think I need to take some time and work on me and to get into the recovery routine. I've had stretches of recovery of 2+ years here and there since 2012 and I've only managed those long windows after going to rehab 

I think the main reason it's been so tough doing it on my own is that I get sooo absolutely miserable. Like I'm depressed all the time. I got on vivitrol and I was literally never happy just a shell of myself just making it through the day. Then I found out I could still get high on viv , I just had to take twice as much. 

My question is if I decide to do suboxobe MAT will that make me happier? Will having those receptors filled prevent the malaise and the feeling of no joy? Or prevent the post accute withdrawal symptoms?

Because if it does id be willing to be dependent on a prescribed medication. I originally went with vivitrol because I wanted to be off everything. But now I really just want my life back and having to see a doctor once a month is a small price to pay.

Having gone to treatment so many times I feel like I understand what it takes to stay sober but my problem is the actual part of wanting it. Not to say that I would love to never feel always sick and weak as I have for years but as soon as I start to feel somewhat normal I get right into that old mindset of wanting to get high again. 

My brain knows that it doesnt want to get high and that getting high will only lead to negative consequences  but i get these sort of flashbacks for a split moment of feelings of happiness and nostalgia associated with using. Since my first time going to treatment Ive moved back in with my parents to help get me back on my feet and while they were supportive the first time around mentally and emotionally every time I fuck up I feel like the verbal attacks get worse and more cruel even after I get out of treatment. I definitely understand where they are coming from due to all the pain I caused them but I feel like its detrimental to my recovery (just last night when I relapsed it happened after some stupid argument about a HDMI cable being moved to another port). 

In the recovery community I always hear that I have to hit my rock bottom in order to make a change and while my life has been ruined in a lot of ways I still have a lot in my life that I say I havent hit rock bottom yet. I dont want to get there but every time I start turning things around I get fooled into thinking that me going back to using occasionally might even be beneficial to my life. I am a pretty easy going person so the fear of hitting rock bottom doesnt drive me to want to stay clean because anytime something bad does happen my mentality is just sort of oh shit just another bad thing to add to the list (being locked up multiple times doesnt help add to this way of thinking)

I should note that all 6 times ive gone to rehab I went to the same place and they stress pretty hard there that all rehabs are the same and that I wont get any more out of one over another If I myself do not want it badly which I do want it but its like my will always changes as soon as I start to feel better. Ive been doing outpatient therapy but I feel like it doesnt help at all as I havent gotten to even meet my therapist in person due to covid and I feel awkward just ranting to someone I dont know over the phone. 

Has anyone ever felt like they were in my position and got through it?

I’m 23 years old, and yesterday I just hit 2 years clean from opiates. March 11th 2019 is the day I decided to check into rehab for the first time ever. It all started March of 2017 when I first got introduced to fent. Every weekend turned into every other day. Every other day turned into everyday. Went from smoking to shooting in a matter of weeks. Had a gnarly 2 year run. OD’s, losing jobs, many many many attempts at detox with and without subs, traumatic experiences, homelessness, fights with gf, fights with mom, lost relationships, and then finally the threat of jail.

Fast forward to the weekend before March 11th 2019, I was sitting in a motel room coming down from a 4 month binge. I had gotten kicked out of my moms a couple weeks before. I had a warrant to appear in court for multiple shoplifting charges. I had completely ran out of money. I was just so fucking exhausted of the life and knew something needed to change. Checked into rehab where I stayed for 65 days.

Not gonna make this a super long post, but my life has completely changed from getting sober. I’ve made so many friends in recovery, I went back to school, my relationship with my family has never been better. I’ve been at the same job the whole time. I’ve had many close connections and spiritual experiences. I’ll admit, I’m not perfect. Life isn’t perfect, but damn I’ve never had it this good.

If you’re struggling, reach out for help. It’s there if you want it. Come on over to the good life. I remember posting here before I got clean about how suicidal I was on like day 12 of trying to detox off heroin and about how pointless life was.

finally started treating my ravaged lungs and sinuses. my post-covid perpetual dry cough is damn near gone. I coughed up a disgusting amount of phlegm and blood at first but things have been able to heal and I’ve never been able to breathe better or deeper in my life. No longer spitting up bright red in my toothpaste every morning, at the very least not nearly as much. 

I cry so much more now. At the drop of a fucking hat. 

I finally feel at home in a body that I purposefully destroyed for years to try to ignore the fact that I was hideously queer and enormously sheltered in a conservative Christian family that pulled me out public school over the slightest thing. My abusive step-dad finally gave up the act and went radio silent, despite making more supposed effort in the 8 months since I moved out than he did for most of my life.  I legally dropped his last name a few weeks ago. I’ve never felt freer. 

The slightest things will still set me off. My wife was talking about getting her blood drawn for labs (a regular event that happens to me too without any flare ups), and suddenly I’m craving so fucking bad, even though I’ve never used needles. 

Lots of time with heating pads, ice packs, sauna baths and showers. I’ve lost 40 lbs in the last 3 years. 

I’m falling in love with a man for the first time in my life. I finally feel seen. And heard. And truly loved by the people in my life. 

I finally started my Criterion Collection DVD watch through. Giving myself blocks of 30 films at a time (to go chronologically by spine order as much as possible while still accounting for different tastes on different days). I’ve been enjoying it so much. 

I start college again in the first week of April. Dropped out 8 years ago. I plan on finishing my associate’s this year and going back to the university I had to drop out of because of mental health and financial reasons. 

Once the pandemic is over, I’ll be able to step back into a career I love, with a sous chef spot all but guaranteed. They paid me more than enough as it was to be able to survive during these awful times on unemployment, which I am ever thankful for. 

I am so blessed. 

I miss my ex wife so much. She kept me warm. In a way that nothing has been able to match. I would throw so much of this goodness away to feel that rush one more fucking time. But I can’t. I’ve got a family now. 

Kratom when I’m hurting and weed through the day and I feel true to myself.  

It’s hard. Really fucking hard. 

But we keep going. There’s not much else otherwise. I have a home, a wife, a boyfriend. I’m safe. I’m in so much less pain than I used to be. Finally out of abuse and stress, able to breathe.

I have been on different opiates for few years. Heroin and fent first, then bupe, and last few years methadone and lately dope on top.

People that are selling dope or addicts are all backstabing bunch cause all they want is the next hit or money..

I have support from my family. They have been with me on the highway to hell and now hopefully on the way back.

2021-03-13 16:15:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/m4fmyj/my_life_on_sober_pt1/,My Life On Sober Pt.1,"     Hi, my name is Sydney and this is my new way of sharing my thoughts and whatever else that has to do with my day to day recovery. So, if you're an addict in any stage, be it using, struggling, recovering, etc.. Then follow along, because I can guarantee that you will find something to either relate too or maybe something to make you feel less alone. My goal is just to share my story, the rest is all a bonus so for this, I'll keep it more like an intro, so, here we go;

     So where to begin.. Well, I guess the beginning would be a good start! I was started, deep within the nut s- I'M KIDDING!... I'm a martian. No, I do not mean ""E.T. Phone Home"", but more like the stand out, the one who neve belonged, singled out like I was green with a target. That's what I mean by that, by all accounts, I am in fact human, though you may doubt that later on down the road... But let's not spoil the fun yet. Back to where I was, ""The Beginnings of an exploration of rock bottom and how low it can actually go"". I didn't have a bad childhood, far from it actually. Though none of my family was ""blood related"", I learned early on that ""blood relations"" means almost nothing when s**t hits the fan. I lived in a moderate home on the outskirts of a small town, but was born in a city and only moved to the ""sticks"" when I was 3, so even then, I had this sense, I did not belong. Jump to school.... Oh, school. Where young minds go to be molded and shaped into succesful parts of the syst- I mean society. They teach you stuff like to color inside the lines, to do your assignments on time, to conform to the ""norm"" and not be a wrench in the system, ""The world has no place for disruption"", aka, FOLLOW THE RULES! Well, let's just say that I conflicted with this in many ways, even at those young ages. I was bullied by student and staff alike, and in any and almost every way you could imagine..; the names.. Pfft, child's play! The beatings, meh, you get used to it and yet again ""conform"" cause its easier that way right? WRONG! I really hope not, but if anyone young guns are reading this, LEARN TO PUNCH EARLY! No bully in the history of bullying has ever come back from the bullied kid dropping the beat down on him! But, myself, I just learned hoe to ""take"" the punches so they kept coming, harder every year.. So again, skip ahead about 10 years later, nothings changed but my attitude and views on this thing we call ""society"". My hair dyed black, my belt spiked and pink. My outlook, grim but earlier in 8th grade, I had started to play guitar which ended up with me meeting a few people, and low and behold, being introduced to pot.....

I have planned the last several years of my life around my goal of becoming a doctor of psychiatry. 

In February 2017, I recieved several drug-related criminal charges but was only convicted of a 4th degree misdemeanor for possession of heroin (I am very lucky!). In April 2019, I was convincted of a 4th degree misdemeanor for domestic violence after I faught back when my abusive ex-boyfriend was beating me.

I have been clean and sober today since June 24, 2019 and I have truly changed my life around. I plan on taking the MCAT and applying to medical school in the summer of 2022 and beginning in fall 2023. My charges will not be available for expungement until 7 years after my plea dates, which will be May 2024 and April 2026. If accepted, I would begin residency in 2028. 

Do these criminal charges greatly hinder my ability to get into medical school? Will they affect my ability to work in a hospital during medical school? How much/how little? Is there no hope? What should I do?

I have been told that I will be asked if I have been convicted of any criminal charges during an interview, and will likely also be asked if I have had any charges expunged for entry into a residency program. Will I have to answer yes? If I manage to get my charges expunged, will I have to admit to getting them expunged? Could they see these charges regardless? 

I'm happy to expand on whatever you'd like. Thank you in advance for your help! I sincerely appreciate it!

Dont know how to to tell my mother.","I adore my mother more than anything in this world. And I have put her through hell so many times, broken her heart, caused her severe grief and stress.

She lives for me, as my sister is unaffectionate and largely ignores the family. My heart breaks when I contemplate the inevitable. I'll need to buy a new car, but the money is gone.

How can I even begin to tell her this? 8 years of on and off again addiction. All my friends are married and with careers and children. And here I am with absolutely nothing.

I refuse to suck off her much needed retirement savings. I'm on my last sac. Tomorrow is detox day and I've planned to take Kratom for the first day, then suboxone the second, as I never make it past the first day on subs or on nothing.

My addict mind has only found solutions that are deceptive, manipulative, untrue. I keep concocting ways to cheat myself out of the hole i dug myself into.

But breaking the news of not only months long relapse, but an entire 10k wasted, will shatter her. I cry at night when I imagine how I will tell her. I dont want to put her through any more pain, I love her so much.

I feel stuck. Stuck in the lie. I have no choice but to detox, continuing use is off the table. And I have no money for a car except savings bonds that I will have to dig into which are my last bastion of financial defense from poverty.

I can't tell anyone, as I have no woman, no friends. So here I am, droning in a post that no one will read, and will sink to the depths of reddit and fade into obscurity.

And more than the fear of withdrawal is breaking my mothers heart. My selfish, lazy, undisciplined demeanor has hurt her more than myself, which is the worst thing in the world.

The woman who brought me into this world, who showered me with love, who never gave up on me during addiction. She will pay the price. And I have had a lump in my throat for months, constantly on the verge of crying, which naturally fueled the addiction just to get some respite and forget how far I have failed once again.

To all the loving mothers out there, god bless you. No matter how strong you love someone, somehow the heroin still wins.

I broke 4 years of sobriety during COVID isolation. It broke me. I didn't have the resolve or discipline to man up and push through.

So here I am telling my biggest most closely held secret to strangers on the internet that I will never meet. Another insult that I would tell redditors before my own mother.

My mother suffers from Fibromyalgia and Arthritis and was prescribed Tramadol for a long time. For a while, nothing seemed to be off about her behavior. Fast forward to June of this year when all the lockdowns began and we began to notice certain patterns in her behavior that didn't add up like blowing all her money within a week while neglecting her financial obligation such as the phone bill and groceries. Then she would be very anxious at night barely sleeping, she began to lose a ton of weight and had days where her mind wasn't working properly (speaking incoherently). She would sometimes tremble and her stomach would constantly ache. In light of this, my dad and I decided to take her to a program for people with addiction; she was reluctant. From here, they took her to the hospital after a fibroid was discovered. In the 4 days, she spent in the hospital she was essentially forced to go cold turkey. After a tumultuous return from the hospital, we began working on alternative ways she could deal with her pain with CBD, we found a good psychiatrist and we've been working on getting her access to a pain management facility as well as finding other doctors for her long list of health issues such as diabetes. For the time she came back to the hospital she had more motivation. She would go out more with the family, she re-decorated the entire house, began painting pictures, and had plans for a backyard garden.  However, since January I've noticed that her behavior has slowly been deteriorating. She tries to avoid going to her doctor appointments, she goes out really early to ""buy breakfast,"" she stopped all her plans for the house and the garden have stalled and she has stopped painting. All she does now is sit in front of the TV all day every day. Complaining about she's done with everything. How she's already tried but things simply don't pan out. She's getting frustrated with the CBD treatment. We're still trying to get her to go to the pain management facility and go to the other doctors. Luckily, she still goes to her psychiatrist but that only goes so far in terms of recovery. I'm honestly feeling lost, frustrated, and helpless in this situation and fear she may have a full-blown relapse once my dad goes back to work in person and I go back to College in person.

So I had 2 relapses and finally got to 63 days it felt so awesome. I felt great. Then one day, I get home and eventually my parents leave so it's just me and my sister. Me and my sister go through my parent's room to look for court documents and such because my dad always says if I knew what my mom said that we would be enlightened that he's a good person or some shit. Anyways, there was this emergency hearing 3-4 months ago over my mom leaving pills out and me relapsing. They weren't actually left out I had gotten through some locks and took them. This hearing was called by my dad due to my relapses. He always talks about how irresponsible this is. Anyways, there was a court order that everything had to be locked up. He decided not to follow it and being an addict is not good. I found percoets and gabapentin. Immediately I wanted to take them. But, I didn't I went to a meeting and talked about exactly what happened. Everyone congratulated me and told me I was doing an awesome job. 

Upon going back home I cannot stop thinking about them. It's on my mind constantly and it just won't go away. They are also 50 feet away from me at this time. I was trying so hard but had just succumbed to them. I snorted them in my bathroom. My dad then found out from my mom and proceeded to literally destroy my bathroom door. Like I mean it was locked and he punched it down and broke it. He then proceeds to back me up into a corner and get very very close and cussing me out and started touching me and trying to take my phone. He has hit me in the past and has made death threats against my mom so I had no fucking clue what he was going to do. 

I feel awful about my relapse. I had so much time. Everyone was so proud of me. I feel worthless and like it's gonna take forever to get it back. I lost 63 days. That's my record and meant so much to me. Now I have court on Monday and am at risk for probation among other shit. I'm really worried. I don't think the judge understands addiction and it feels like she doesn't want to help me. The thing I feel the worst about is I own a website. www.youngaddictsunited.com where I post other people's stories and help others and it gets around 350 users a week. I just feel worthless and like I don't matter. I feel like I'm a piece of shit like I'm talking the talk but not walking the walk. It feels awful. Everyone sharing has more time than me. It feels awful. I lost the desire to get clean for a while but it is back now. I am glad. I'm better than that. Any advice or tips would be awesome.",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6689501}"

I have a history of family depression and anxiety. Some family tragedies and maybe a concussion have exacerbated my mental condition a bit. I had to bullet point this just to get it out...I've never told anyone this story and I keep getting interrupted having to feed our newborn or hide this from my wife, so sorry if it's a mess...

**2015**\- My Dad's cancer diagnosis shocked and deeply saddened our family, he was given 6 months to live. He was my hero. I lived a block away. I became his part time care taker in addition to working full time. He struggled and stayed alive for 6 years. It became a major part of my life to take care of his needs plus deeply affected my marriage being so unavailable.

**2016**\- Dad prescribed Hydrocodone 10/325. Started taking a few pills here and there, became my lifestyle. Dad rarely took pills and relied on pot, I picked up his meds and somehow convinced my step-mom that he was taking them. I Became numb but MORE IMPORTANT happy, loving, friendly, reaching out to friends, able to care for my Dad and my dream career accelerated, I made great money and felt like I was solving/handling a world of problems, marriage improved..... but I needed those pills.

**2018**\- Travelling a lot, Dad getting worse every year, afraid of the ""phone call"" every day while far from home. Managing my pill intake relatively stringent but with a few shallow breathing episodes at night, terrified of withdrawal. The few withdrawals I've had were crippling with pain, depression, anxiety and despair. Longest clean was 2 months and still felt terrible.

**March 2020**\- Pandemic shutdown my industry in Live Events, my Dad became more critically ill, pill intake increased slightly and a LOT more regular. Dad bed-ridden and needing more involved care, losing job made it possible for me to help more often. Walking into his house everyday was like experiencing death up close in slow motion... but I was there with him.

**April 2020**\- My wife and I find out were having a baby, we had been trying for months. My Dad was ecstatic and perked up a bit. It was going to be a little boy and my Dad's first Grandchild.

Taking more pills and more often, every major life event required me to not be in withdrawal or use pills to maintain composure, mood, ambition. Found a little work but mainly taking care of my Dad. He had a few near death close calls in the middle of the night.

**December 2020**\- First child born and still using pills, ashamed that I was using pills during life event, had to be strong for my wife + child and not sick. Dad meets his first grandchild. Had moments I swore that I was done with pills after nodding a bit while feeding our newborn. I dial it back.

**January 2021**\- My Dad's condition at worse ever, needs diapers changed, needs to be hand fed, his pills were adjusted to Morphine for Hospice. I'm still using pills, terrified that I might be compelled to use morphine when the Hydrocodone ran out...I pulled about 20 Morphine pills from a bottle of 100 just in case.

**February 1st 2021**\- Taking care of newborn in the day and my Dad at night, my Dad is sleeping 90% of the day now. My Hydrocodone stash is running out.

**February 26th 2021**\- Surrounded by family my Dad passes away holding my hand. I never thought twice about taking the morphine, I just did it. Being the 1st and oldest son I could not be sick in this moment, not for the family, not for the ceremonies, not for my child...I always knew this day was going to come eventually....

**Today**\- Buried my Dad 2 days ago. My boy is now about 2 months old. My supply of everything has run out and it's past 12pm when I usually take a pill, I'm super nervous and have no idea what to expect, I just know its gonna be bad.... I feel like the full weight of so many major life events are about to get raw and I'm going to be crushed without my pills.

I've been trying to reach out for years to get help and either by bad luck or coincidence there's always been something....some fucking event or moment that I couldn't afford to be a bad son, Husband, caretaker, new Father or business partner going through withdrawal and being a depressed burden of a man...I'd daydream a lot about being pill free and still happy/helpful to others.

Where do I start?? I'd like to keep this under wraps for fear of loosing my child and Marriage. I have a new job coming up and I don't think my Wife is going to handle this well, she almost left me 8 years ago when I told her about using pills infrequently....I've gone through withdrawal quietly and secretly before, I feel like I know what the answer on this is going to be....What do I do in these first few hours??

**Update 3/12:** 1st day was hell and difficult to hide. I slept all day long and tried to work the next day but wasn't ""there"", chilled to the bone, sniffles, extremely unmotivated....Talking with you all I realized Subs are for more serious cases and best left to a Doctor's recommendation. I also didn't make it really clear how much I was using but for myself it's the mental component that cripples my life...I can't afford to be massively depressed, particularly with a newborn.

**Update 3/13:** Kratom is kind of a miracle substance...Thanks to the help of some that have messaged me I was able to get through the worst of the 1st couple of days, although...My depression is creeping in and I'm starting to daydream about a full bottle of pills...Worse I'm afraid if a stronger option presented itself, there's no doubt I'd be weak and give in...Considering if Subs will keep me from going to the streets for relief...still pretty confused. Haven't told my wife yet but plan to this evening, thanks for everyone's insights, stories, advice...so far this has put me on the right track and I'm really hoping I keep it that way, particularly for my family.",12,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43744797}"

I took them from may to about July really then I would get off them for a while and then go back.... basically the fent presses had done something terrible to my body... I started to develop a very nasty back ache that I was only prone to if I was sober(my brain getting dependent on the drug), so pretty much I’ve been on and off with them since mid 2019 the longest I’ve gone without them was 2020 in June where I went an entire summer without oxys however I was taking a 1/10 off a 8mg suboxone strip everyday for the entire summer sometimes I would up it to a 2/10 not knowing that suboxone has a dangerous half life that is worse then heroin and oxycodone... so however one day as I’m on a 5 day vacation trip and I only bring one strip with me unaware of the withdrawals because I had never gone an entire 72 hours without the drug the entire summer.. basically the maid throws away my strip thinking it’s trash and now I am without.... I start to feel the worst withdrawal symptoms ever it was like the weirdest shit it wasn’t really like an oxy wd it was more like im halfway okay but the restlessness was driving me I.N.S.A.N.E mind you also the very bad back aches are driving me fucking ballistic... it made me cave in I knew someone in the state I was in selling real pharma 30s and I bought just 1 and just like that I was back stuck on oxy again I came home and immediately bought a 50 count of 15s hoping I could subside the suboxone withdrawal and maybe go through regular oxy WD again cause it might be better.... it didnt get better and only made me chase the drug to get sleep and improve my back pains... this was in September of 2020 now my birthday and a lot of other holidays were coming up and I wanted to be I. Good spirit for everyone around me so I kept using so I wouldn’t be miserable.. around December 14th of 2020 I had a tolerance of about 120-150mgs a day of pharma oxy when I abruptly ran out without concerning myself to find more in time, I went into acute withdrawal for a day before I decided To take a piece of sub film but that was right before Christmas and I knew I wasn’t ready... so I started using again but my kept my tolerance very low almost to about 30 maybe 40 mg a day.. and I’ve been working on that since then so now here I am on day 2 I finally had the guts to quit a few days ago and it is insane... I know that with time it only gets better I just hope this back problem will go away soon (if anybody has this same back issue please say something so I don’t feel alone) before I discovered suboxone in February of 2020 I went cold turkey for 2 weeks with Kratom but I felt that the Kratom was just making my wd effects even worse I don’t know man I’m all over the place I just want to do this the right way this time I’m trying to go cold turkey as much as I can but this job seems almost impossible without at least a pinch of subs, also the brand of bupe I’m using this time around is yellow it’s called alvogen a lot of people hate it I’m hoping that is because it’s less stronger, anyways for anyone that was using oxy for a longer time period then me or higher daily dosage please tell me when you started to feel better on either a cold turkey or using subs...

Within 1 hour I was on the floor - felt like I was having contractions like I was pregnant every few minutes. Start at my mid stomach moving up to right at the middle bottom of my rib cage before moving upwards to my heart and throat. Each time I wailed like I was giving birth again. 3 maybe 4 hours passed intensity was not letting up. 
Was afraid I would die or have internal bleeding g something. Something was wrong. Wasn't the typical precipitated wd where you shit and vomit. I called a gf who came over with a opiate and narcan for safety. She stayed with me for 3 hours while I slept. 
Woke up feeling high and angry. Very sad. I want nothing more than to be sober. But I also know something went very very wrong. 
I'm not taking more opiates. But I'm not fucking touching  naltrexone until I figure out wtf happened to me.

I know I sound so weak for having problems with this, but please hear me out and give me advice....

I have endometriosis, chronic gastritis and enteritis, IBS and Hashimoto. I can't take NSAIDs. 
I got prescribed Tramadol 50mg one year ago for the worst days. During the last 6 months and especially after my COVID infection (thank you dear ex flatmate...) the pain flare ups got way worse so I needed more Tramadol...usually 2-3 days with one pill a day. Then 1-2 days without. Strangely enough I had a whole week without Tramadol during COVID without my abdominal pain.
Well, I had a stool transplantation, treatment with good bacteria. I have a feeling that my pain gets less.


Now I need to come off the Tramadol. I know my dose was really low, but I still have problems. I am on day 3 of wd. I can't sleep, have restless legs, stomeach cramps and I feel like crap mentally and phisically (sneezing, runny nose, coughing like crazy at night).
Do you have any ideas, advice how to handle the symptoms? 
Plus, what if I have a really bad pain day again? It is sometimes so bad that I faint from the pain. Is it possible to take one or would that throw away the whole process?",3,"{'covid': 2, 'infect': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9244816}"

Written on cellphone, and first ever Reddit post. 


I feel ashamed asking about this because I know my recovery was easier than most people but as time passes it’s getting harder in ways I didn’t expect. I am sober for fourth months. I spent a shorter period of time injecting first dilaudid, morphine, and cocaine, then I turned to cocaine and heroin. Eventually the cocaine use stopped because I had 5 massive seizures where I was blacked out for over an hour at a time. I was in a very abusive relationship at the time from my shame of admitting he raped me when we first met and convincing myself I was being dramatic and agreed to continue being with him. He’s the one who introduced me to drugs and he would be furious at me for sleeping so he forced me to inject speed and then crystal meth with the heroin (I didn’t want to but he would hit me if I didn’t or force me to overdose on heroin and wait longer and longer before bringing me back) 
I was a stripper before all of this and I burned through 50 k savings and COVID money buying both of us drugs. I have nothing now. I have overdosed a lot, all but 2 of which were punishment overdoses. I dizzily remember him injecting me with a punishment overdose once and saying “I wonder if you’ll wake up from this one” right before I passed out. It was a horrible, horrible time. 

But this is where it gets better. First my drug dealer manager to get me alone and have a talk with me that the way this guy treats me is not okay and that I am so much more than what I was doing. Other people had said it before too but I started to listen to him. And my ex boyfriend also never gave up on me. He has been with me through this entire thing. At one point I asked him how he is so sure that I will recover. He said he sees to two options. I listen to everyone else and quit, or I listen to myself and quit. I asked if he sees a third possibility, he says no. I slowly started to give myself little goals. Things I could accomplish in 10 minutes or less and worked my way up. And that helped heroin to become something I didn’t want anymore, because I started to enjoy completing goals and it impaired it. And I broke up with that guy (who I suspect has narcissistic tendencies). 

Well. Wow. One morning I got out of bed and I realized I didn’t want heroin. Or crystal meth. Or cocaine. Or morphine. Or cigarettes. Or anything. I felt physically sick and terrified of heroin especially. I didn’t take suboxone. But I didn’t have any cravings or withdrawals. The terror gradually faded. I enjoyed the insight I’d gained without wanting to go back to it.  I started doing my school work again and I’ve done half of a semester long course in the last 2 weeks, maintaining a 99% average. I’m happier with my body than I’ve been in a long while. I’m going to go back to work (I really loved being a dancer and drugs didn’t start until after I left work for quarantine, they’re not related) I’ve been getting into things like Star Trek and minecraft with my ex boyfriend, and I didn’t ever really fall out of love with him but I’ve fallen more in love with him than ever. And from conversations we’ve had it seems like he’s in a similar place. I also redid my bedroom. Everything is perfect. But I don’t know how to deal with perfect anymore. I’m used to having something self destructive. I started to think about heroin again. I’m finding references to it in songs and listening to them on repeat. I’m wearing a hoodie my dealer gave me constantly. Laughing about jokes about it. Not thinking about doing it. Just thinking about it. 

Then I went to get blood taken, I made the mistake of telling the nurse to limit triggering things because of what I had been through. She used a tourniquet. And had me palpate and choose which of my old shoot up sites to use even though I was crying and begging her not to make me do that. She asked if I missed it when she had a needle in my arm. And said I should take a naloxone kit because I will probably relapse. 
Doing it was beyond awful paired with the punishment overdoses and all of it. But now I want it again. It’s been 4 months. It would kill me because no one is around to naloxone me. But I want it. I really really want it and I can’t think about anything else. I don’t know what to do. Everything is so good right now. But wanting it and wanting out of everything being so good is getting more and more intense. I feel like I don’t deserve this and like I’m not doing enough and like I’m pretending to be something I’m not and I want heroin again. 

I could really use suggestions for what to do, or if anyone else has experience this, or really just anything. I have looked up helplines and I have a therapist but it’s not the same as talking to people and having input and suggestions or similar experiences to deal with isolation. Really I just feel alone in this and I really need support.",4,"{'covid': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67796314}"

If that wasn’t fucking consequences right away idk what is! lol I know I can do this and I know I want to be sober. I’m not sure why I fucking veer off hard to the left randomly when I’ve been doing so great. 6 months is no major accomplishment but I was proud of myself. I’m just sitting here like what the fuck, ya know? Why? I have no desire to go use right now, I don’t wanna touch that shit. It’s so cut with fent where I am, I literally black out on the shit past a certain point and it’s no bueno. I don’t remember what I did, I come in and out of nods. Off like .1 .2. Obviously my tolerance is way down having 6 months but before that I used for 9 months and it was the same thing. 
Just so many problems that come with that lifestyle and I’m over it. I need to get it right this time. 

Anyways just venting I guess. Words of encouragement are always welcome! I hope you all are having a good night! Never take for granted being able to sleep through the night, eat normal, exercise and feel some what like a human again!

Past summer I tried going cold turkey on a higher dose, but failed. So I’m bit better prepared now, I have  two 8mg suboxone tabs in my possession and was able to score some baclofen. Im doubting whether to use the subs to make the wd more bareable, because I’m afraid it might stretch out the process longer then necessary.

Suffice to say that the first days were hell, first few weeks kinda sucked and I had chills for around 3 months. I'm glad to say I'm now 145 days sober, coming up to 5 months and I've been getting along well. I've ""slipped"" from time to time and bought a bit of cocaine or amphetamine but I've not touched an opiate in that time.

I feel so much better in myself, I feel \*alive\* again. Previously, work for me was ""get an entry-level job and try to not get fired"". Now, I've already had one promotion in the last 2 months and I'm looking quite well set for another in the next few weeks, I'm actually able to focus on productive endeavours. My relationship with my girlfriend has improved significantly now I'm not routinely lying to her. 

If I can do it, you guys can too, but you have to do it on your own terms, looking back I don't think there was anyone who could have successfully got me sober (including myself) when I didn't truly want to.   


I would like to thank this sub for providing me with a great deal of support during the early stages of recovery, and in case anyone remembers my story/ posts- just wanted to let you guys know that yes I'm still sober and I am successfully getting on with life! : )

This was my biggest post during my detox if anyone needs a reminder of the story.

If you're just starting off, stop, while you still can, because existence really is pain. I just feel low today, and wish I could just give in, but then I'd have to go through this again. Which I never ever wish to go through again.

Anyways, anyone else going through this? Anyone else already gone through this and had similar length of initial type withdrawals? I have read the worst symptoms can continue on for about 8 - 10 days? 

I am going to be looking through the forum now to read people's stories but also wanted to give those of you just starting out a warning. It is not worth it in the end.

I think anything is OK in moderation; for a couple of years I would have them every month or two, just one or two every weekend. Since Covid and lockdown for some reason I have had way more access to them and without realizing it, I’ve become addicted and I think it’s messing with my health. I have been dealing with some super low hormones which I think is a result of extended opiate use. I’ve been talking 20-30 mg for the better part of a year straight. I realize this isn’t much, but I recently made the connection when researching about the hormones - apparently, opiates can cause dysfunction in the pituitary/adrenals. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? All of mine are depleted and it’s causing other health issues, dry skin, dry hair, mild depression etc.… The pills make my mental state better, make me feel more motivated and happier, and make the symptoms and life in general more bearable. When I don’t take them I mentally feel like shit BECAUSE of the low hormones and but all they’ve taken on my hair/skin etc.… But then I take them and know/think I’m making it worse or causing more harm; it’s a vicious cycle. I am 30 and my levels are lower than the lowest end of someone who has gone through menopause… I never thought that these would have an effect like this, I mean I know they can’t be good for you but I always told myself they were OK because they are prescribed, and some people take them for chronic illness etc. so there can’t be too many side effects. I know that’s bullshit, but some thing I have told myself to make myself feel better. This definitely snuck up on me and I used to have to clean up every month or a couple of months because there were limited pills. I moved back home for multiple reasons but a plus I thought would be that the opiate problem would be solved because I don’t know anyone here and won’t have a hookup, BUT my guy offered to send them... and now I’m struggling to say no. I am very healthy otherwise, eat clean, exercise, take herbs and supplements, juice etc. I know a few days of sweats and chills and stomach issues is inevitable, but does anyone have any tips that can help? I want to finally do it and get back to who I was prior to the pills. I don’t enjoy life if I don’t have them. All the things I used to live seem dull and boring unless I have the pills. I know this is typical and it’ll take time, but I need to start somewhere and start working toward that direction mostly for my health right now, but for my life also.

Welp, you read the title. I had been clean since mid June 2020, went into a rehab, then to a sober living, and enrolled myself into college and got a job. In January I moved back with my parents and left my job so I could focus on school (I have in person classes and my parents live a couple miles away from the college). 

This was my longest time sober, ever. And I truly wanted it, I hardly ever even had cravings, or thoughts of using. I feel completely disgusted with the druggy life and the things it made me do and the 5+ years I wasted doing heroin and meth. I am on 4 mg Suboxone and have been through most of this time. 

Then one day in February I’m going through the spare bedroom closet (my parents stored a lot of my stuff there since I was completely incapable of doing anything with all my shit during my drug use) and I found a foil with a decent amount left there to smoke. Just like that I made the decision to use. Waited the next day so the sub wouldn’t cancel it out, pulled some money out the bank, smoked that tray I found as I’m driving to go pick some more up.   Figured hey, all I gotta do is wait 24 hours to get back on my subs when I don’t want to do it anymore! No big deal right?

Well this weekend I came clean to my parents, with an empty bank account and a sincere fear and anxiety of what I had done. Was I going to have to quit college? Move out? Go back to rehab? Start all over again? Thankfully, my parents are amazing people and asked me if anyone else knew. “No..” I said, truthfully. So my dad says, “Well, then let’s leave this between the 3 of us. This is a lifelong disease your gonna have to deal with and your gonna have hiccups. I know how hard it is to come back from using and having to face everyone when you fucked up again. We love you and we just want to support you.” We then discussed why I had gone back out for the past couple weeks- which was a mix of things including stress, boredom, and just plain old missing the feeling of being high. 

So from Friday night all the way to Monday morning, I detoxed. It was hell. Saturday I white knuckled it. Mid Sunday I took a sub (a full 24 hours at least since last use) and got precipitated withdrawals the rest of the day. I was in so much pain on Sunday night my mom felt so bad she gave me a couple 15 mg xr morphine (she has chronic pain so from her script) and I was able to take a hot ass shower and sleep through the night. Monday, I’m exhausted but feeling better. I take some more suboxone. Didnt help, but didn’t hurt either. Miss class that day and am very uncomfortable all day but it was much, much more bearable than any of the previous days. 

Now it is Tuesday and I’m officially back on my suboxone and all that is left is the depression and the cravings. Every single second I’m sitting here just wanting SOMETHING. I just want to smoke something, I just want something to do that is an instant pick-me-up. I don’t even know how I did this for so long, without even thinking of using. I just want to get high constantly, but I don’t want to use heroin and throw everything away. God help me.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5232351}"

Started 1st February, took the last dose 3/2. 450-600mg a day accompanied with 3,5-5mg of Xanax a day to prevent seizures as I had one past on the Tramadol. This evil drug is making me jittery, so I could tell when a dose of Xanax wasn't sufficient enough and needed to up this dose that much.

*(At 3/3 I start to fast taper the dose of Xanax starting at 1,5mg and today I am at 2x0.25mg/day, I had only 7-8 x 1mgs left so I needed to fast taper it rather than going CT although it was just a month. Apart from neck stiffness, I don't have any other WD symptom, or maybe* added depression ?)

I was taking Kratom 4,5g x 2 daily since the first day of stopping Tramadol, could hardly feel any effect from it apart from the taking the physical aspect of WDs away and some of the mental aspect. I stopped CT Kratom yesterday.

Depression was the reason I was abusing opioids, but the depression I am feeling now went on another level. Like feeling to cry all the time, and then crying. And more crying over small things and feeling extremely hopeless. Too emotional. This was intensified the 2nd day off Trams despite being on Kratom (or maybe when it wore off 5 hrs later I guess?) Life seems so pointless and scary, to the point of extreme existential fear, like I was getting a panic attack not from anxiety but from terror/sadness. Like want to vomit if I don't cry.

While day 3,4 and 5 off Trams was managable, I stopped CT believing that its serotonin aspect was over and I could handle CT Kratom, I was wrong. 30 hours after Kratom last dose and feeling again like crying and started crying. I was depressed my whole life, but barely cried. I gave up and took Kratom. 4,2g. Seemed to numb the pain and physical WDs but no effects whatsover of it. Will not take more of it and stop today.

Is this some kind of Trams leftover WD still causing depression ? Is it Kratom ? Or is it all, Trams+Kratom+Xanax WDs ?

It was that bad today that I was searching over the internet symptoms of negative energy in a home (I thought, it can't be the WD, it must be something else I am missing here, I've done that pattern of using the same substances in the past with the same length and depression was pretty manageable then) to the point of leaving my house and spend the whole day at my grandmas house, feeling a bit better.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.85576946}"

The physical WD this time hasn’t been as bad as others for some reason (minus the bone chills I still have) 

I used Kratom for the first 3 or so days (not a high dose) have sucked it up
With clonidine gabapentin soma and some benzos and some ketamine infusions (at a clinic) 

Since using the benzos multiple days in a row for sleep I know I need to stop that and just accept that I won’t sleep for a while. I’ve been here before eventually it comes back, eventually

My plan is to get back on vivitrol 

Right now my physical issue really is just chills- which fucking suck. Yes clonidine and gaba help but now that I’m day 9 I need to taper off those meds too. The gaba I’m a little worried about b/c I was taking it in lower doses for about two months in conjunction with oxy. But really only like 2-500mg a day max. During detox that went from 6-900mg. I know some ppl say no WDs from gaba but some ppl do. Also currently dealing with a torn disc and sciatica pain (gaba scripted for this) which is also why I went hard with oxy lately to help with actual pain ans tolerance just shot thru the roof for me

I feel immense guilt, because I am sure I was the one that helped them find their last hit. I told myself I’ll stop for them, and it’s been 5 months later and I still haven’t stopped.

First time posting here and really hope someone can help point me in the right direction.  My brother is a heroin addict. He has been using on and off for a few years. He is at a point where he wants to get help but we cannot afford rehab and he does not have insurance. I am at a loss for what to do and am desperate to find help. 


The most ideal situation (I think) would be to get him to a rehab center, but those are very expensive and we are not sure how we would cover the expenses. 


I have thought about inviting him to live with me, but last time that happened,  he stole money from me and used my house for drug deals. It did not seem to help, but rather enable him to use in a situation that was more comfortable. I also am concerned about his safety while he is quitting as I know the withdrawals can be painful and dangerous without supervision. 


I am hoping for advice about our options.  Is quitting cold turkey an option? I assume it is not, but I am not sure what other options we have.


Sorry if this is a common post in this sub. I really need help for him and pray someone can share their insight with me. Thank you",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7048219}"

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. If you have any advice I’d love to hear it. 

I’ve been dating my 24 yr old boyfriend for about a year now. I’m a recovering addict who’s been clean for almost 4 years (alcohol/cocaine) and I’ve been pretty stable for a while now but I do struggle with depression episodes every now and then. I don’t see myself doing any drugs nor wanting too especially not after discovering my boyfriend has been lying for the majority of our relationship about using drugs but more specifically fentanyl. 

When I met him, I knew he smoked a lot of weed but it didn’t really bother me, also I never really liked weed and I knew I was never gonna be interested in joining him when smoking. A couple of months ago, I found some foils and tooters in his room and confronted him about it. I had never done anything like it so I wasn’t really sure of what it was. He told me it was some pills and that he had only done it a couple times and was not gonna keep doing it. I was stupid enough to look the other way and believe him. I should’ve known.

A couple of months passed and our relationship was going pretty well, he’s an awesome boyfriend, super attentive and loving, a great person, we had some problems here and there just like any other couple but he’s always been respectful and honestly one of the best if not the best guy I’ve ever been involved with.

I was a little suspicious and always checking his room/car for evidence but I never thought anything of it it all seemed pretty normal. A week ago, I asked him if he had stopped doing it and he swore he hadn’t. The next day, I went on his phone and found some messages between him and one of his friends who’s also a fentanyl user looking for recovery but unfortunately keeps relapsing (I didn’t know about that friend until that day) He admitted to his friend that had been using and that he was thinking of quitting(that might have been a lie).

I confronted him and he confessed and finally told me what exactly he was using, fentanyl. I got really mad. We both started crying and I just felt so betrayed and disappointed, I couldn’t look at him. Maybe I was just too stupid for not leaving the first time, or seeing the red flags. It also doesn’t help that we live an hour away. He said he was going to look for help and I guess he has an appointment later today. He’s been experiencing some withdrawal symptoms but nothing crazy yet, he said he was using once or two times a day every other day. 

I’m feeling frustrated because yes, this might not be about me, but after going through what I went through, how am I so stupid for getting myself into this situation???? I know is not my fault he’s using or that he lied but I should’ve known better and leaving now is way too painful. 

I’m not sure what I’ll do, as of right now I’m just waiting for him to at least look for some help and tell his family or at least some friends (I’m the only one that knows) and then see how it goes.

He’s been amazing and I love him very much. But I love myself more... I’m confused and stressed but I’m afraid this might never end. What if he gets clean but relapses all over again? I can’t see myself going through that, and staying with him.

I feel like I’m strong enough to at least give him a chance, but I’m scared, for his life and we’ll being and for my mental health as well. I don’t trust a word he says and can’t see him the same way I used to.

Update: we didn’t see each other all week and he kept saying he wasn’t using anymore yet didn’t mention any intense wd symptoms. I knew it was bullshit but I didn’t wanna confront him until I saw him in person. Friday he came to my house, we spent the day together, he was taking Xanax and seemed to be handling it pretty well, I told him how I didn’t believe he was not using for the past 3 days (after he had admitted using Tuesday for the last time). On Saturday he woke up feeling extremely sick, throwing up and shaking like crazy. He admitted he last used on Thursday but I’m sure he’s just been using like usual but lied to not make me feel so bad. I told him he had two choices: either coming back to his house and telling his parents, or dropping me off but that I was gonna have to tell them. We came back to his house and the first thing he did was run to the bathroom and use, he felt pretty shitty about doing it, and I couldn’t have stopped him. His parents aren’t home today but tomorrow we’ll meet them for church and I’m hoping he’ll tell them afterwards. The relationship is definitely over but I’m still here to support him. His parents need to know before I leave him for good. It’s the least I could do. I know a lot of you might say I should stay out of it and let him do it at his pace, but using fentanyl is a matter of life and death. I would never forgive myself if he died tomorrow and his parents had no idea. They’ve been nothing but awesome to me and they’re incredible parents, I know that they’re gonna support him and that they have they have the resources to get him the help he needs. I know he’s the only one that can save himself, but I also know that if no one had told my parents behind my back about me using and they had done something about it, I wouldn’t be here days away from celebrating my 4th year anniversary of being clean. I know he has doubts about telling his parents, what’s you guys opinion? Thank you again, you have saved me from hours of uncertainty by giving me all of this advice. Even though I’ll always be there for him if he needs me, I’m ready to let him go.",25,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42999867}"

I did my laundry and took out the rubbish and cleaned the kitchen! I deserve a reward!"" And we all know, three reward is our DOC.

Now, I know it takes time for the dopamine pathways and they entire reward cycle heal from opiate abuse. I know that's probably why I feel nothing after managing a lot of housework right now, only vaguely annoyed, as if my brain is saying ""get the reward juice! I ain't making its for you!""

The thing I'm scared of, is if those pathways never recover. Half of the reason I started using was because I was severely depressed and suffering from clinical anhedonia - the inability to feel joy, satisfaction or pride in yourself in doing everything. My psych meds weren't working, I was in limbo with the system to get psychiatric help beyond my GP. I felt hopeless.

Imo, anhedonia is the worst. I always use the mashed potato analogy. you like mashed potato ok. It's fine. Nothing special. Kind of dull if not seasoned with other ingredients. You have it for dinner one day, cool.

Next day. Mashed potato again. Uhh, sure, I guess we can do that. Maybe money is tight right now

An6d then you start getting it everywhere. Your tasty coffee? Mashed potato.
Your favourite dessert? Mashed potato.

And you talk to your friends about it and they look at you like you're crazy because they're sitting at the table with their regular fucking food and not seeing the plate of the same fucking mashed potato you've been eating for SIXTEEN MONTHS.

That's what it feels like for me. Just... I struggled with this sort of thing, like I said, I'm scared that either the opiates, damaged my already faulty pathway.. I  hope the drugs I'm using that acts on dopamine, do I'm hoping I'll finally get some sense of accomplishment in doing things",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7813924}"

You end up slipping up in your dreams and using or at least getting some of your DOC. In my early recovery, this happened to me a lot. And it used to make me feel terrible. I felt guilt on just about the same level as I would if I had relapsed. But not anymore. I dont have control over the person in my dreams. That guy ain't me. He is just a manifestation of my addiction using my subconscious mind in an attempt to guilt me into giving up. Honestly, screw that guy. He can fuck up all he wants. I dont have any control over him. What I do have control over is what I choose to do with my life and how I am going to fight my battle against addiction. And conscious me isnt gonna give up just because I fucked up in a dream. The same goes for cravings. Dont feel bad because you have cravings for the thing that has probably ruined your life. Dont feel stupid for still wanting that horrible substance. You can't control that urge. But you can control how you act on it. 

Your addiction doesnt care about you. It will do whatever it possibly can to try and make you feel like a failure. Because all it wants is for you to fail. So long as you continue to struggle against it, you are succeeding.

I'm not sure if the cravings and subconscious manipulation ever goes away completely. I am 8 years clean off of 10 years of H and it still happens to me on occasion. It is VERY rare, but yeah it still happens. I had a using dream last night. And when I woke up, I went about my day and didnt let it slow me down because I know that's not me anymore.

I was told that I needed to practice complete abstinence from all substances. That I could not trust myself with anything abusable. This is something that I can not bring myself to agree with. Perhaps this may be true for some, but it is not for me. The only substance I ever had a problem with was opiates. I know for a fact that I am 100% incapable of moderating my intake of opioids. And for that reason I practice abstinence. The key to living a productive life is in moderation. A cup of coffee in the morning is not going to kill you. A glass of wine with dinner is not harmful. A little marijuana in the evening is in no way a problem. Substances aren't the enemy here. Excess is the enemy. Gluttony is the enemy. Just because something is a habit, does not inherrently make it harmful. If I recognize that I am doing something to a harmful excess, I take steps to moderate myself. If I find myself incapable of moderation, I have what I would agree is a ""bad habit"". At that point, abstinence is the correct option. I found myself unable to subscribe to the accepted notion that, as addicts, we are powerless against such things. I most certainly am not powerless. I would argue that my recovery has made me stronger, more keenly aware of my own failings than the average. My strength to fight my addiction came from within. Not some higher power. Not through surrender, but through perseverance. 

I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way. Or perhaps you have arguments to the contrary? Either way, I am just happy to talk to people also struggling under the same yoke that I have been.

Edit: this post came in kind of a stream of consciousness and I feel as though my main point may be a bit obfuscated as a result. I just wanted to add that this is in no way an attack on complete abstinence. Moreso it is me expressing my frustration with those who believe that this is the only way and all other paths to recovery are a cop out or failure disguised as success. The bottom line I wanted to express is that everyone's road to recovery is different and there is not just one ""right"" way to get there. If it works for you, it is the right way. For you. Keep fighting the good fight and never let someone tell you that you are a failure because you won't do it ""their way"". You do you.",39,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5246192}"
