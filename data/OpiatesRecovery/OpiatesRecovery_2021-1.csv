I managed to keep the dosage pretty low, around the 25-50mg a day. I saw a doctor about a month ago and started tapering down, dropping 5mg every week until I quit. He also prescribed me some Buspars and Clonidine to help reduce my anxiety. Around 3 weeks ago I lost control when my dealer offered me some 30mg oxys. I couldn't say no to him since I missed how they feel so much. Ever since, I started taking about 3-4 of them a day so now I'm at 90-120mg! The worst thing about this is that I snort them! I snort them probably more than I take them orally which is probably the worst part. I'm at a point now that I take them just to be balanced and not to eliminate anxiety or depression, I barely get high off of them now which is crazy thinking back on when half a pill would manage to dose me off for 5 hours straight. I hate myself so much for taking the 30s. I was doing really well with tapering off slowly with the 5s and now I'm afraid since I can't stop taking the 30s (The 5mg doesn't affect me nearly at all at this point). Am I overreacting and am just afraid of how the WDs might feel? Should I just embrace the pain and quit cold turkey now before it's too late? Also how much worse is snorting them rather than just taking the regularly? Does it effect the level of addiction at all? I heard mixed answers about that and am not sure, I sure hope not. 

Anyways sorry for the long post, just felt like I needed the rant and also to get some opinions, I know that some people here have it much worst than I do, but I still feel pretty frightened about whats to come and have a lot of uncertainty. Also I haven't even told ONE person about my addiction other than my drug dealer obviously haha so I think that I'm just panicking myself much more than I need to. What do you guys think I should do? What are some of the methods that helped you the most? Anything will help, also feel free to DM me as well.

Yes, I'm 16 for those who could tell I was young. I was in the very early stages of opioid addiction. Someone called me a garbage can and I think that perfectly sums it up. Some of you probably saw my, what I like to call when the drug demon comes out, posts. I had questions about heroin and such, of course, clear-headed it's not something I want to try. 

Anyways, about last night. It was late and I could tell my urges were getting worse and worse so I hit a meeting. I spoke to where I was and I was worried I was going to relapse and that I was not doing great. I got a list of numbers and went home. When I got home I was deep into my drug mind. I figured out that there is a guy who lives less than a minute walking distance away from me and is selling Vicodin(my poison) at 5 a pop. Of course, I hear this and immediately start to sell my shit. I had started to go outside to sell an Xbox controller when I got caught by my mom. She didn't know what I was doing but I ended up not being able to sell it. Which I believe is a small miracle. Otherwise, I would have been high that night.

I finally ended up stop ignoring my sponsor and I gave him a call. He was very supportive and I told him what had happened. I told him even from those little interactions with my mom and being secretive and reverting back to addict behavior I didn't want to live like that again. 

I realize I have to do something different in my life. I have to change my mindset. I must set myself up for success otherwise I will end up a true heroin addict or dead from the pills in a month or two. I know that because that's how I am and I can't ever stop. I know the nights are when it gets difficult and I have this toxic obsession with getting high that completely consumes me. I need to workout or plan my evenings so I don't have time to think about drugs, when I'm busy I can be clean.  


Thank you for reading. Additionally, I have a website that discloses addicts' stories and helps carry the message to the addict who still suffers. I know I don't have long clean but it's been helping me stay clean. Any support would be awesome! If you want to add your story j hmu.

I haven’t gone more than 3 days for al least the past 2 years and if reached 10 in the last 6 years. I hate this so much so I decided to jump, used subs the first 4 days (tapering immediately I only used 3/4 of one 2/8mg sub strip cut up). Yesterday was day 13. I relapsed for seemingly no reason. I took 3 real 30s last night. I didn’t enjoy it. The first one seemed like I didn’t realize what I was doing but the last 2 I did together and then cried myself to sleep. I’m so scared I’ll never be free. Will I go back into full blown withdrawal? If not, do you think I can just wait the 24hrs take a piece of sub and start again? It was surprisingly comfortable this time. The cravings are so hard. Please help guys. I’m so upset and ashamed. Advice please. It felt good to get paid and just pay my bills. What’s good is that I have money and don’t immediately want to go get some bug for how long until I cave in again. This was such a nice 2 weeks. I was tired and a little run down but I actually was present with everyone and it gave me a glimpse of normal. It’s crazy how quickly I felt like a person. It felt soooo good. I only slept at night when intended, I paid attention to people, I cooked/ate like a regular person. Waking up without being sick by day 4/5 and by the end of week one I wasn’t dozing anything. The cravings got heavy once the sub fully wore off and I caved yesterday. I’m so upset with myself. I have plenty of sub left. I got way more bc I thought I was going to need a lot. I am trying to be very careful bc the only drug I want anything to do with after this is weed. Honestly only until I can sleep normally. After that I just want life. I am glad that I’m not too into anything else. I started smoking tobacco with pills for a reason I don’t understand so I quit that first. I asked to increase my antidepressant due to quarantine crazy and surprisingly got them to put me on 200mg Wellbutrin 2x day. Then I went down from about 100mg a day to 45mg per day quick, miserable tapper over just two weeks. I was planning on a 6 week tapper but I realized that anything under 30mgs at a time made me crave super hard. Instead of running from it I half assed at work as much as I could so o could be depressed. The Wellbutrin did its job bc I was a bit depressed but not too crazy. I really fucked myself. I had the chillest detox and the mental weakness was swift and by the time it sank in I couldn’t unsnort them. Any advice. Please help. Should I prepare for full withdrawal?

So he tries tapering with Methadone works for a little while untill he's back on the heroin again and I find out a week later about that. He's almost all out so he has to visit his plug we talk about that about what's he planing on getting he said that he's gonna be getting more methadone, but I guess the temptation was too strong so he ended up getting heroin and methadone.
So let me share the latest conversation that arose great concerns and doubts in me. We are having a conversation about addicts and lying and I was interested why he didn't mention doing heroin at a house party that we were at together so I asked him and his answer was that it was gonna lead to questions. I was shocked and repulsed by that. It created so many scenarios in my head where he might of done something but just ended up not telling me because it was gonna lead to me asking questions about it. If he could have kept his addiction a secret for months he can probably cover up some other things as well.That thought is very unsettling so I was curious to find out your experience on trust and addiction. Have you struggled trusting your addicted loved one and if so do you have some advice on the matter? 
If you are the addicted loved one do you normalise lying, do you strictly lie about your drug usage or does lying develop in other areas as well?

First, selfishly, I may try to use this as accountability when I start what I hope to be my final detox in the next few days. Second, reading through others stories has given me hope and inspiration so hopefully I can contribute there.

Anyway, I’ve been taking 30mg roxies daily for roughly 5 years. For the past couple of years I’ve been taking 4-5x pills a day (120-150mg) on average but with plenty of weeks where I was taking nearly double that every day. Always snorting or oral. Never crossed over to needles and have always only used pharma-phresh pills so no fent/presses. For me it started as a way to escape dealing with some personal problems and not so quickly spiraled. Up until the past 6 months or so I was somehow able to maintain a relatively functioning life with my career, family, friends, spouse etc. I am fortunate to have a high-paying job, which unfortunately has fueled my very expensive habit.

I’ve been ready to quit for a long time, but have never truly put my detox/recovery first and so my past attempts - whether by choice or because I couldn’t re-up- have never stuck. However, after teetering on the edge of maintaining that veneer with the other aspects of my life, my addiction has recently been affecting all the other aspects of my life in ways that are forcing me to finally make ending this shit a priority that has to happen now. 

That’s the silver lining I’m taking from my recent issues. Fortunately, while I will need to repair the damage caused to friends, family, spouse, work etc., I don’t think I’ve lost any of those things for good, and getting them back and doing right by them is my ultimate goal.

As for my detox plan this time - taking a week off from work so putting the weekends on each end of that together is 9 days where I can detox. The anxiety of the real world has been a trigger to relapse in past detox attempts so I need to shut it out until the first stage is past. 

I have kratom, weed (flower, tincture, edibles), adderall (prescribed) and all the various vitamins. With all of that stuff ive managed in the past to lessen the acute WD symptoms by about 65%, but restless legs, anxiety, and insomnia were still big issues. So I’m going to see a Dr. this time and be honest and ask for prescriptions for gabapentin and clonidine, which based on reading so many other posts I think will put me over the hump of being able to get through the physical WD symptoms. I know it’s still a long road after that first 9 days to get my brain back to functioning normally, but I’m confident I can do it.

I plan on posting updates as I progress. At the very least having somewhere to be 100% honest without worry is a nice feeling. I know I should be that way with spouse and family too, but that’s for another time/post (maybe). 

For anyone that read this whole thing and is trying to get clean too, I hope my story can help even a little in some way.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4582818}"

Started my recovery in NA and did that desperately for about five years.  I had a tough time getting any traction at first; it was an endless cycle of relapsing and cleaning up.  

For reasons I've never understood, things finally started to click for me.  I found a doctor a like a lot and with him and his staff I got on suboxone maintenance.  I had tried subs before with no luck.  But for whatever reason, this time things were happier for me.  I've been sober, and on subs, for about 14 months (clean date is Sept 24, 2018).

Not sure how much time I'll spend on this subreddit.  I find myself thinking about dope very little these days, and I want to keep it that way.  But I do sometimes miss talking with people who know about recovery and who know what opioid addiction is like.

What has worked for people that can't wait the time it takes for Suboxone to be used? PS I am opposed to any long term replacement treatments such as methadone or long term Suboxone use (more than one week) for myself personally at this time but would love any and all input

I want to get clean. I've been smoking heroin for almost two years and I'm done. I know my options- at home detox (CT or Subs), medical detox, or methadone. Wish Heroin Assisted Treatment (available in Switzerland using a step down to synthetic opioids) was a possibility but it's unfortunately not being used in the US. I've attempted at home detox plenty of times. Just like a lot of people, I can't get through a whole 24 hours or so without H in order to take a Suboxone safely. The comfort meds I have tried to use are Xanax, weed, and wax. If anyone thinks it would help me, I could get additional comfort meds to try such as clonidine, gabapentin, etc. for my home detox attempts. My question is- would a medical detox work any better for me? I understand that it's a controlled environment but there is still nothing stopping me from walking out the door once I hit the \~12 hour mark or so without H where I just can't take it anymore and give in to go pick up. I've had people tell me I don't want it enough. I disagree. It's just that every time I hit that point- the pain, discomfort, anxiety, and knowing that these feelings will only get worse and continue until the kick is over become too overwhelming. It doesn't matter how much I want to kick while I'm well, as soon as I'm sick I'm a completely different person and there seems to be no stopping me in doing what I need to do to make myself feel better via smoking H. It's so bad that I've considered doing rapid medical detox under anesthesia because it literally feels like it may be the only way I will be able to get clean. However I worry that this method will do extreme damage to my body or even kill me? But I also don't want to be on H the rest of my life purely because I can't get through the detox. Does anyone have any advice for me?  Anything they think might work for me? Any reasons why medical detox may help more than home detox even though I have the same comfort meds available to me? (and FYI having my phone doesn't make much of a difference to me since I have no friends or anyone I use with and I pick up large amounts of H at a time so it's just always there). I also have sober friends that have watched me while I try to home detox but nothing stops me from going to pick up once I hit my breaking point which is literally only 12 hours H free or so. I feel so helpless. It's a never ending cycle of I hate heroin and I'm going to kick this shit, it's going to be different this time. Trying to induce Suboxone and failing again. Extreme shame, depressions, feelings of helplessness, and wanting to give up. Giving up and then trying again, giving up and then trying again, never succeeding. I've heard of the Bernese method as well but my intentions with Suboxone have always been short term (not wanting to use it more than 3-5 days). It seems that the Bernese method is a prep for a long term MAT program with Suboxone considering the build up of the Suboxone and taper down period of H is spanned over 10 days or so.

On day 4, 83hrs, I think I’m through the worst of the physical withdrawals, just bit tired and got a bad case of the can’t be arsed’s and no motivation!

usage back ground, been prescribed codeine 30mg and Tramadol 50mg between 100 and 150 of each, each month for the past 8yrs and probably been abusing it for 6yrs, same old story of eventually you realise it makes you happy, then you take more and more!

Was also taking nurofen plus which was 12.8mg codiene mixed with 200mg ibuprofen on top of my scripts for a few years but not anymore as they stopped selling it OTC and made it script only so since then been using dihydrocodeine to top up my daily tablets. 

I am able to get additional codiene that is prescribed sometimes as I have a friend that gives me hers. daily usage can be vary depending on what I get my hands on, a ‘good‘ day (to me) I would be taking 380mg dihydrocodeine, 400mg Tramadol and 240mg of codein, not taken at once but throughout the day! Sometimes more sometimes less.

Got through the past couple of days with the cheap lopermide, Vitamins, water and ibuprofen and not doing much physically but now I feel like rewarding myself! I know that’s just stupid!

I know it’s so early but I just feel so bored and the pills make me feel like I’m enjoying life and I miss that feeling!

Read through a lot of posts of here which have helped and just taking it day by day I guess!

First time posting, but always read the posts in here.

I was living in San Francisco and using H daily and at the peak was using 2-3 grams per day. Obviously I could not afford that for long and things got out of hand. I unfortunately was using behind the love of my lifes back, and ended up losing her and the life we had together. This completely broke me, and I gave up, was living in my car and was hoping that I would overdose every-time I would use. 

I am fortunate to have a loving family who intervened and were able to get me help. I had to come to so cal and entered a 30 day residential program and am now living in a independent sober living program and getting back on my feet. This program helped me get through the PAWS(not fully over it) and the hardest parts of early recovery with a supporting community of people like me and staff that really have my best interest. I get drug tested 2-3 times per week and am fully self sufficient, am holding a job and filling my time with new hobbies like Guitar, bicycle riding, cooking and just learning to live a ""normal life"" that we opiate addicts can have such a hard time dealing with. Yesterday was the first time I experienced true happiness when I was simply hanging out with my friends in the program and just really was able to gain insight into how miserable I felt when i was chemically dependent. I still have cravings daily and am working to figure out what I can do to manage these symptoms and looking into recovery groups such a smart recovery and possibly NA although I have been to meetings and have honestly never felt genuine about joining. If anyone has any suggestions for long term support groups, please let me know as I am fully aware that I need to stay active in my recovery and cannot just ignore it. That has gotten me in the past to relapse. 

Anyways, just wanted to share my story to encourage the route I took if you have the necessary means to enter a long term recovery program. I have tried on my own so many times and finally received clinical help for my severe OUD and am feeling very fortunate to have received actual help. Happy to be apart of this community, wishing everyone the best!

Over 10 years went by. I have everything I ever wanted. A beautiful wife. A home. 2 kids. A job in ministry, a pastor even. Norman freaking Rockwell. 
One day I was in a gas station and saw a little silver packet offering some relief from stress. Kratom. I bought it and took it and was stunned at it feeling like an opiate. I kept on buying it and hiding it from my wife. I never would have thought it could be so destructive. I know there are lots on here that won’t like me criticizing Kratom. That’s ok. I understand. It may not be a big deal for you and that’s ok, but it is for me. I personally became very physically addicted to it and it’s WD’s are not a lot different than Oxy that I can tell. 
Anyway that went on for over a year. I came clean to my wife and my church. I confessed. Lost my pastoral job. But I did finally get off Kratom in April 2020. 
Now here I am again. In January I fell back into it and used for most of the month. Now I’m back in WD’s and I just feel hopeless. All in all I mean I’ve tried to quit Kratom 5 times in the past 2-3 years and haven’t made it more than 8 months. 
I don’t know what I need to do. There isn’t really a good NA system in my rural town. 
Do I need to go to a 30 day program? Idk

I kicked quite a large habit about 9 years ago. Mostly  opiates/benzos that were over-prescribed at the time but I quickly found myself out of the legal stuff and would buy oxy's, coke, fent, whatever I could find really. Got clean on my own after almost 8 years of being fucked up. Felt like absolute shit for a long time. Like I said it's been close to ten years clean from all that but I just have to say this here: FUCK YOU BRAIN! you've been off that shit for so long! Why the FUCK are you making me take lines in my dreams? I find a baggie. What's that in it? Blue 80's. The old kind. All the sudden my dead ex bf and his friend are sitting across from me. Looking down at the cd case I've got three fat lines on. His mom walks in. Starts crying. I know why. Her son is dead. But he's also right there. Looking at me because I have the powder. She begs me to leave, to keep it out of the house. I want that bitch to just leave us alone why won't she leave?? I start crying. She's just worried. I walk to the sink and even though it physically hurts to do it I watch the water as it takes that beautiful white powder down the drain. Now I feel angry and I wake up feeling that exact anger.
    So... I came here. To tell it. I just hate that however long I may go being clean my brain will periodically try and get me high in my dreams. Is it to remind me how awful it was getting clean? Because I fucking remember. Is it to test me? I've not once relapsed! Which is as shocking to me as is it to you. I thought I would die that way and I honestly didn't care. Not then. I'm depressed as hell and kinda don't want to be alive even now but I'm still not using. Why the fuck do you have to put pills in my dreams? Fuck!",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.954931}"

(Fuck subs and methadone tho that shits govt funded dope..worse than fent,h, Oxy or anything else)
I’m so ready to be clean but bottom line is I’m scared. Hard to admit but gotta be real. I heard kratom is great so I got hella red maeng da, got a rx for gaba and pins already and been taking lots of vitamin C. All this month I’ve been trying more seriously than ever and with nothing in the back of my mind telling me that whole “one day you can start fuckin with opiates recreationally and be fine”- NOPE! I want none of this.
However I make it anywhere from 2-4 or even 6 days and then go get fent. Idk what it is because the Kratom and all the other shit really does help for physical symptoms and I’m doing a lotta physical and mental work.

Hey all. I recently had orthopedic surgery that has a moderately long recovery period and is quite painful, especially for PT. That would be OK, but I still have to live life, care for my toddler, my pregnant wife, work, etc. 

I was in pain management pre-op for the condition for about a year. Started with Tramadol and eventually was taking Hydrocodone, as needed, 15mg for any relief. Usually just 2-3x a week.

Anyway, now post-op, pain management has put me on oxy 10mg, up to 6x per day. Plus valium 5mg as needed, but I'm not needing that much anymore. The plan is that I'll be on this for 6 weeks, up to 3 months. But would be weaning down towards the end. 

I'm concerned that being on what seems like a fairly high dose per day for so long is going to lead to major dependence. Especially from taking meds around the clock. Is the dependence from 10mg 6x per day worse than 60mg/day in 1-2 doses? 

I just want to know what to expect. There's not much I can do as I need the relief to get by. But living in fear of WD is driving me crazy.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.62241334}"

Hey, I’m 495 days clean off opiates and a bunch of other shit today, 500 seems like a milestone, but I feel I’m at the point where I’m not anxiously waiting for the next month, to say I’d have X months clean/sober. 

Today, I received and installed my new RTX 3080. Before my opiate and especially meth addictions. I loved computer hardware and software, gaming, programming, etc. I’ve assembled/built my own desktops since I was 12-13, was always a great hobby that I really enjoyed. And it made me interested in computer hardware, which led to me pursuing a compsci degree in 2018 (dropped out because of my addiction to opiates and benzos however).

After feeling the greatest pleasure, euphoria, whatever, mankind has to offer. In the form of IV furanylfentanyl and alpha-methylfentanyl/China white. If you’ve experienced fentanyl or any of its various analogs through IV use. You know what I mean. That rush is unparalleled by nothing else, heroin and meth don’t even touch it.

However, today I finished putting in my new graphics card, and when I got it booted up, set up, ran benchmarks, etc. I found myself genuinely enjoying myself, like I was a kid again. Almost made me cry to be honest, and that’s ok, I learned it’s ok to cry. I’ve been numbing my emotions for so long with so many drugs, it’s time I feel and express these repressed emotions.

I know it’s a small thing, but it made me happy today, and happiness is rare for me to find. I’ve been struggling recently, wanting to go back, to feel nothing again, the bliss calls me. So far I’ve been able to refuse. I know what drugs like heroin and fent bring, lying, stealing, falling out, abscesses, missing shots, having to get new rigs or just reuse the same one 20 times and shriek in pain with every poke.

Today, I’m not going back to that, today I will stay clean. I know personally that I have no power over opiates, once is too many, and a thousand never enough. If I go back, I’m dead unless I somehow have another wake up call, and I know my luck has run out.

Hope you’re all having a good day, no matter how much time clean you have, cherish it, but don’t fixate on it, don’t let it consume you. Clean time can become an addiction like anything else, and a relapse when you’re in that mindset is fucking shit to put it lightly.

Hoping to meet friends on here + gain support on my journey this time 💜","Hi everyone. I’ll go by ‘L’ on here for anonymity. I’m (26) F and it’s my like 4-5th go around with opiates. This time the shortest. Being 3 months on black, and only smoking it this time which is way better than my past.

I’ve struggled with daily use of h many times. The longest being a year and half daily with no breaks and 6 months of that time IV. I’ve been on suboxone and methadone programs in the past for detoxing off.

I’m here for support and to share my progress this time getting off. I plan to stop this week. I bought my last bag tonight. Might be useful to mention I’m also slowing tapering off of benzos as well with a doctor.

I have a dentist appointment I’ve been waiting to happen, tomorrow, and that’s why I kept using partially because I couldn’t be in the middle of withdrawal while that was happening. I talked to my doctor and he prescribed me clonidine, and a script strength Imodium for my detox that he thinks I’ll be fine this time to just quit and promises me it should be easy. I think it’ll be a lot easier this time than my methadone CT or any of my other Heroin detoxes in the past.

After this bag, just a bit over a gram, probably will last me 2-3 days max; it’ll be the end for me. I didn’t intend to go this long and I’m not happy on opiates. They make me sad. I miss my life it’s already dying just from a few months using.

So I’ll be taking the two meds I mentioned above along with some others I’m already on like phenobarbital, zofran, and baclofen if needed. Also gabapentin. I think I’ll be golden with these options. I hope!!

So hello 👋🏼 to all of you in recovery and those just beginning. Let’s do it together. I can’t wait to be off and I hope it goes smoothly. Wish me luck! I’m hoping to find some inspiration and friendship in this community here. 🙏🏼💜

Maybe TMI but........ Oh well.

My point is, it's hard to keep occupied in these quarantined times, and obviously we can't spend every minute of our free time walking or working out - so what activities have you been engaging in to keep yourself occupied since kicking? 

I am on Reddit too much and I also play games on my phone too much, but I've also decided to put that gaming to good use and take up a language. I haven't decided on which one - I can read most French and Spanish and write a bit of both so there are foundations there, but I am intrigued by other options, especially German, at which I SUCK but it's such a cool language!

I'll probably use DuoLingo, Memrise, and Tandem for learning. I could do with more concerted efforts at reading, too - I was on a roll right before I kicked and then the symptoms and following endo flare smacked me back down. Gotta fight to get back in the reading groove. Finally, I've been trying to sort out my piles of paperwork that I've neglected for months. I tossed all the junk, just have to put papers in their proper folders now which isn't too bad except that I micro-manage and there are so many folders and not in an easy-to-read storage situation because of lack of space. Well, something to work on.

I'm a writer. I'm writing a short story about a man who endures the horrors of heroin withdrawals in an alley in San Francisco with only his dog. The story is turning out to be about the human will, the desire for change, along with homelessness and addiction. In the story, the main character experiences cravings, pain, depression, hot and cold flashes, shaking, nausea; the withdrawal symptoms. But throughout the story, in the thick of withdrawals time and time again he goes back to a book of inspirational quotes he found, and he reflects on them, and reminds himself of a dream he has of living in a big house with a field where his dog can run and chase rabbits.

My question is: If you're in the middle of heroin withdrawals, is it realistic to think about things like that? Can you take your mind off of the sickness? Can you reflect or remind yourself of dreams for the future? Or are you too sick and agitated to do so?

I was lucky to not get thrown into withdrawal again but the PAWS has been horrendous and I’ve been doing LDN.

But basically I got shit faced last night. Downed a ton of rum after feeling very depressed. I’m obviously no shining example but in the six years I have been on a path towards harm reduction. I haven’t used heroin or needles in four years or something, it’s hard to remember. Once I moved to the east coast and fentanyl was everywhere I said fuck this I’m done and had just had surgeries and was getting oxy. Switched to poppy seed tea and went back and forth between that, kratom, and subs. A lot of my benders would start with kratom and when that didn’t cut it anymore I would move onto tea.

My best friend, on the other hand, is an absolute train wreck right now. He’s sleeping in his moms truck outside of Walmart and doesn’t have an ignition key and is supposedly on a wait list for detox. He’s smoking, snorting, and muscling some sort of fent analogue or mixture, popping Xanax, and smoking meth. It’s breaking my heart.

So anyway, I proceed to get hone and get shit hammered drunk. I woke up feeling like absolute death, still drunk and dizzy. I had one dose of benzos left from my kick and I took it to alleviate the hangover. It helped but not enough. I went to get some fast food to make me feel better and ended up going into the smoke shop and getting kratom. I feel much better hangover wise but bad about myself. This is a constant cycle and trigger for me. I’m a junkie and a drunk and when I’m off one I jump to the other. Being hungover is a huge trigger that restarts the cycle for me. Opiates are the perfect hangover remedy. I feel myself starting to accept that if I don’t stop drinking so heavily (or maybe stop altogether) that this will be a never ending cycle. 

I’m sure it won’t make me sick again and I know I should toss the rest out but... it’s damn hard. I feel like I’m just getting myself stuck in a perpetual state of PAWS. I wish I could go to a treatment center for even just a month, get some time under my belt but I won’t go during the pandemic and I also have to save face...

Fast forward to today, I take Tylenol #3 plus dilaudid. My treatment plan is changing now that I have a new doctor, which is great because I really want off the opioids but I honestly don’t know if I can do a weaning schedule again because my cravings get unbearable about 12 hours post-dose and I have no idea how to properly handle them. 

Would it be reasonable to ask my new GP about low-dose suboxone in order to come off the codeine and dilaudid? I’m not sure how a weaning schedule would even work if I’m dependent on both drugs.

A head full of regret and a brain full of disassociation. After a few days in the ICU and a hellish rollercoaster at a long-term rehab facility, you come to the realization that maybe, just maybe you have a problem. This isn't the way everyone's story begins but I imagine some of you might relate.  To stop doing drugs seems an impossible and unmanageable task. But, what's unmanageable is the way you lived your life before you got clean. Ceasing to do drugs doesn't only stop you from actually doing drugs, but additionally, your whole life is transformed in incomprehensible ways. Admitting you have a problem is a difficult step. However, acknowledging the issue and taking action steps to resolve it are worlds apart. Once you are willing to do something about the problem you have started recovering. A new way of living. And most of all, a new beginning.

The depression is more than I've been capable of dealing with. The amount of shit I've put in my body within just the last 24 hours is absurd. I can't even comtrol myself at this point, I just can't bare it..

Today I took 120mg dxm, dramamine, thc, alcohol, trazodone, 1.5 grams hallucinogenic mushrooms, DMHA.. Say nothing about the growth hormone secretagogues and selegiline I've been on for months. And that's just to keep myself from blowing my brains out.. 

I'm losing it. I don't know what to do. It's 3am and I'm sitting here alone in an empty house having a nervous breakdown. I literally want to die. I can't check myself into a hospital. Been there, done that. I know first hand how they treat people like me. I'll get locked in an empty cold room, left to sit in my owm torment for days on end.. 

I'm scared to even wake up tomorrow. I wish I had enough drugs to put me down for good right now. I'm fed up with this shit. Get me outta here.

Update: I survived the following day thanks to everyone who messaged and replied here. Thanks for the support everyone. I'm still very depressed but looking for ways to manage it without the use of so many various drugs. I'm looking into kratom but am still very worried that it might slow down my brain's healing. I'll probably make another thread that focuses in on the topic, as I have many questions and am having a hard time sifting through the information on the internet. It seems to be a divisive subject and I'm not sure what to believe.. Anyways, I really appreciate everyone's response here and will be taking something useful from everyone who posted.

2021-01-22 13:28:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/l2trfh/building_confidence/,Building Confidence,"Hey guys, my last post seemed to go over really well & it made me very grateful for the really nice responses I got, it also has me reflecting more on my usage of opiates and my days of being actively addicted to those drugs. 

The subject for today is building confidence, I did a guided meditation today where the topic was self-esteem, afterwards my thoughts began swirling down the rabbit hole of confidence, and/or lack thereof, and its relation to both addiction and sobriety. 

Confidence generally speaking is very fleeting for most of us. Before and after using drugs, I would describe myself as a pretty overall confident person, I am not overly self-conscious most of the time, I look people in the eyes, and my social anxiety is manageable. However, my confidence is very volatile: when things are going well it is high, when they are not it is low, and it can be shaken quite easily. My meditation today briefly covered the connection between confidence and self-esteem, and imo they are very much a chicken or egg deal: building confidence requires at the very bare minimum enough self-esteem to even put in the effort, because you need to have had some inclination that whatever you are doing (trying to do) is possible and you are capable of doing it. Self-esteem comes from accomplishing things: knowing and having confidence that you will find a way to get it done, and a sense of pride in yourself and who you are. I think one of the most important aspects of sobriety and getting clean is building confidence, and even more importantly it is integral to staying clean or maintaining sobriety. 

In relation to addiction, my confidence (like many addicts') plummeted. After a brief period of time in active addiction I needed to be on opiates/substances to function, I really leaned on them when things got difficult, & it was basically my only coping mechanism. And it worked really well, opiates gave me confidence and made me feel good about myself, probably more importantly they allowed me to not really care about the results of anything except where and how I was going to get more drugs. Naturally one of the main snags in my attempts at sobriety was that I had now lost my source of confidence and only coping mechanism, not to mention that self-esteem was really low as I was never exactly entering sobriety on a high note. I was always riddled with shame, guilt, relationship financial & professional problems, personal issues, and a million other problems, issues, and obstacles with no confidence in my ability to overcome them. 

Enter: hard life lessons. Life has a funny way of teaching you what you are doing wrong, you can only hide for so long, but sooner or later things catch up to you. Unfortunately, when you get sober you have a lot of debt built up on the life credit card and it all comes pouring down on you in addition to the withdrawals, PAWS, and early recovery physical, mental, & emotional symptoms that are already overwhelming. Enter: AA. Alcoholics (Narcotics) Anonymous helped me a lot. Everyone that comes into those programs has external issues in addition to drug addiction that require a lot of time, effort, and self-awareness. AA tries to break you down and destroy any sense of false confidence that exists, which usually needs to happen. Newcomers are generally more fucked up than they recognize. This is dangerous though, beyond the obvious reduction in confidence, you are pretty much told that you need to complete the 12 steps to regain your life, build confidence, and sustain sobriety and wellness. The 12 steps will provide you with a lot of the skills and tools you need to do this, but unfortunately a lot of people don't make it that far. Early sobriety is a really tenuous situation and the 12 steps take months and sometimes years to complete. Meanwhile most (99.9%) of the people that come in to the rooms are already pretty beat up. It's a recipe for relapse. 

Where I went (and still do go) wrong: I have always been highly self-critical. It is an asset in a lot of ways because it tends to promote high achievement and continually striving for improvement. It can lead to negative self-talk, negative thoughts, discouragement, frustration, perfectionism, never being satisfied, minimization of wins and magnification of losses, it can hurt confidence & self-esteem, and lead to kicking myself when I am down. I used to think self-talk was self-help bullshit but it really does play a huge role in attitude, outlook, self-esteem, & confidence; even if it's just subconscious. All of this can really deplete an already waning confidence and cause a lot of frustration and discouragement. There is a really fine line between being critical of yourself and the ability to build confidence. 

In early recovery you are already not working with much, so building confidence is imperative. You need to be rigorously honest with yourself but still feel like you can handle whatever life throws at you.  Recognizing that although you have a lot of room to grow, you can get there through hard work, discipline, and dedication. It's really tough to fight through how you are feeling and what you want to do vs doing what you need to do regardless of how you feel. I remember sitting down in the shower because I just couldn't stand anymore. I was so exhausted, fatigued, incessant aches and pains, mentally & emotionally frayed, lack of motivation to do anything but lay in bed or on the couch, a dark cloud of depression, and a massive ball of anxiety welling up in my stomach in anticipation of having to go to work or do anything outside my house. The small victories come from gutting that shit out and doing it anyways. If you wait until all the cards are aligned and you feel like doing something you will never get there and you won't build the confidence to knock down the other shit you need to do. 

Slowly these little victories will start to add up and you will be conquering things that seemed insurmountable. Some helpful ways you can build confidence in the meantime that require very little work: practice good hygiene (shower in the morning, brush & floss your teeth, make your hair look good, take care of your skin), dress well, take care of yourself mentally and physically (get a sleep routine, don't watch Netflix until 3 in the morning, don't just scroll Reddit for hours on end because you don't feel good and it's taking you out of your own head, meditate, exercise (even if it's just a walk), develop a social life (you won't want to, at least I never did, I'd have to force myself to plan and go to social engagements but it feels really good to not be the person that doesn't show up or cancels last minute anymore), take pride in yourself and how you present yourself, your work ethic, handling responsibilities, cleaning your room, making your bed etc. all that shit. Not only will these little things improve your life incrementally but eventually you will start getting ""lucky"" breaks and either someone will notice and you get that promotion or job, a new bf/gf, your old friends from before you started using start to see the positive changes, your reputation starts to come back, and people will begin to RESPECT you. People respect someone that can get honest with themselves, make necessary life changes, and turn their life around regardless of how bad it got for them. 

Unfortunately, a large part of confidence and self-esteem is derived from how we think other people perceive us, as much as we would like to believe that we act and behave independently of how others view us, that is nearly impossible. You don't necessarily have to conform to society's expectations of a nice house, high paying job, family etc. etc. But you do want to be someone that is respected and viewed as responsible, dependable, accountable, and a good overall person. Most of us had at least some of these qualities pre-addiction, but the lifestyle of a drug addict tends to take this away from you. Of course, there is an internal aspect of this that is somewhat autonomous and acquired through the little victories and obstacles I mentioned previously that we overcome but aren’t typically outwardly visible to anyone else. 

If you are struggling right now, maybe you are in the early stages of recovery, trying to get sober for the hundredth time, have been sober for a little while but life doesn’t seem to be improving, or just struggling in general. Try to be patient with yourself because this stuff won’t happen overnight and there will definitely be some failures, but create a plan to move forward and try to practice some of this stuff. I like to write things down because it provides some order to a chaotic life. Something like: wake up @ 7AM, stretch, make the bed, brush your teeth, shower, meditate, then start to tackle your to do list whether that be reading the AA book, going to a meeting, going to work, exercising, making breakfast for yourself, you get the point. Even if you are in the first few days of your withdrawal or even contemplating getting off drugs you should create a plan. If you let how you feel dictate what you are going to do you aren’t going to do anything. The first few days of withdrawal will probably be spent in bed but eventually you do need to get up and moving, even if its just pacing around the house or walking around the block, making yourself soup, preparing a hot bath or shower, washing your sweaty nasty ass sheets, or preparing yourself to enter withdrawals by stocking up on soups, Gatorade, water, clean clothes and sheets. Creating a plan and sticking to it builds confidence and self-esteem! The earlier you can start moving around and doing stuff the sooner you will start to feel better.

A bit of a backstory; my boyfriend & I have been on subs for a few years. We both want to quit, and we know how to taper, what the withdrawal is going to be like, etc. (we’ve both quit before)

But, what I’m wondering, is WHAT helped you get off them? What items, medications, practices, etc. helped along the way? 
For example, the first time I quit, Motrin & Tylenol, organic energy drinks, lots of veggies & nutrients, & mainly smoking weed helped but I also used Xanax to help me get off subs. Of course, since I’m writing this, I’ve failed and been back on them for a couple years now. I don’t want to use any narcotics to get off them, but I do smoke weed still & plan to use that to help me. Listening to music helped a lot last time as well. 

Has anyone tried Kratom or detox drinks? Did hot baths help? Cold showers? Did you drink water, or Powerade? Which medications helped you; sleeping meds, NyQuil? 

I’m looking for any and all suggestions on what can help us through this journey. Thank you so much in advance to anyone who answers, I can’t thank you enough. :’) wish us luck!!

My question to anyone who has used kratom to ease wd symptoms, if/when you quit taking the kratom for ease of withdrawal, did you experience slightly worse withdrawals and how long did they last? 

Day 1 of taking kratom, dosing 4g per dose every 3-4 hrs. Day 15 Tapered down to .5g per dose every 4 hours and quit that night.

I'm amazingly still off the opiates and decided to try THC as some kind of alternative (I seem to have done the drug thing backwards - started out abusing opiates and downgrading to weed having never tried it before, lol) but whilst its a decent amount of relaxation through the day, I've noticed a slight feeling in the arm where I get RLS from withdrawals and by the evening its in full force. The THC high is not enough to override it and I've ended up laying awake for hours from it for like 3 nights now. Anyone ever had this before or is just the RLS persisting and unrelated to THC? Gabapentin was keeping it at bay during the acute WD's. I've been using edibles, if that makes a difference. 

Honestly the high/relaxation is not comparable to opiates but its better than nothing if it keeps me away from using opi's longterm. I'm sure it could be kind of comparable if I used enough to be completely stoned but I need to remain somewhat functional, which was always one of the big pluses to me with opiates, being high but still functional. Would taking a bigger amount at bed time be enough to mask the RLS maybe or am I just asking for worse doing that?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45231634}"

2021-01-20 23:53:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/l1rdj1/methods_to_kick_heroin/,Methods to Kick Heroin ???,"So I just recently found this beautiful community of people on reddit and made my first post reflecting on my brain continuing to trick me into not getting clean. My next question is if I'm going to wholeheartedly throw myself into kicking this shit, how should I go about it? Backstory: I've been smoking heroin for almost 2 years. I smoke 2g per day give or take .5g. I used to feel like a controlled user, my mind and life didn't revolve around the drug and I was very high functioning. Over the past 6 months, all of that has changed. Instead of smoking when I feel like it sometimes going hours at a time not smoking and enjoying activities, I smoke CONSTANTLY. I can't go an hour without smoking and I think about it constantly. In the past 1-3 months, my level of functioning has declined to the point where I sleep the majority of my day via periodic naps and can't seem to get ANYTHING done. Back when I was a ""controlled"" user, I could take a Sub after about 12-16 hours (easily waiting out that period of time without smoking via sleeping and waking up and not smoking). This led me to believe I could kick whenever I decided I wanted to quit. Fast forward to now where all that has changed. Getting through even 12 hours of not smoking is near impossible given the fact I struggle to maintain sleep for that long and feel the need to smoke IMMEDIATELY upon waking. I can't seem to figure out how I'm going to make this kick happen. The best method that has been recommended to me is a Suboxone taper like so: [[ Stop smoking at 8pm. Stay awake til about 1am and then take a xanax with hopes to pass out for as long as possible. Wake up and take 2mg sub at around the 18hr mark if I am in enough withdrawal. After that I'd work up to whatever dose needed and only stay on Subs for a max of 3 days or so]] However I can't seem to sleep long enough STILL to get to the Sub. I wake up around the 12 hour mark and can't seem to wait 6 hours (I feel so pathetic). Maybe I'm not taking enough xanax to knock me out but I just get nervous about taking too much xanax. Mind you I normally only take 1/4 of a 2mg bar only when I'm having bad anxiety/close to a panic attack (because I have bad anxiety that gets triggered by physical sensations). So...... does anyone have any other recommendations? I've also heard about the Bernese method, rapid detox under anesthesia in a medical setting, converting to pills and then subs, kratom, methadone (these are listed in my order of preference/likelihood to attempt that method from highest to lowest). I've also recently started considering going to rehab. This is an option financially but would require me telling my mom that I haven't been clean for the year she thinks I've been and would cause a lot of issues in my life because of how our relationship is. It's considerable but I've always hoped (and believed) I could detox on my own. I mean what's the difference (medication wise)? I already have subs, xanax, and weed. Would the meds they have really make it easier for me to get through the time before I can induce Subs (i.e. with clonidine, gabapentin, etc.)? Please can anyone share their thoughts, experience, etc. It would be greatly appreciated and anyone feel free to PM me.

Please some positivity.,"I need someone to listen to me i don't have anyone to tell this and I feel so bad. I'm not an english speaker so I hope you can understand me. 

So I quitted heroin more than one year ago with just one day of relapse. I'm in a situation where if I got caught doing drugs I'm becoming homeless again because I refuse to live with my toxic family. 

I only used heroin for like 3 months so I feel like I can't actually consider myself addicted/ex-addicted to it. But I started doing it daily after a week and it really messed up my life. I almost got kicked out the shelter where I was living becouse doing drugs wasn't allowed,  and I used to smoke on the bathrooms. I spent all the little money I earned and some that my mom sent to me heroin. I was high all day and I mixed it with benzos, alcohol and weed everyday. I almost prostituted myself. I've been raped because I was offered heroin. 

I quitted becouse I left my parent's home to have a better life. Not a worst one. 
I got methadone and left it after 3 months. 

So some months ago I was doing methadone ocasionally becouse this person offered them to me for free. Then I started working and I started asking him to get some for me on to take it on Friday an Saturday for the pain (it was my first time working 10 hours a day and as a kitchen assistant I had to be all that time standing). I lost that job after 2 weeks becouse the restaurant hat to close forever. 
Some time after that I stopped doing any drug. I didn't see this guy for some time so I wasn't tempted. Some time after I started seen him again and he offered me methadone (a much much smaller dose bc he knows my situation) and I firmly rejected. 

But two weeks ago I've been thinking so much on doing drugs again.  One week ago I asked this guy to get 2 xans for me (I've abused benzos for 3 years, quitted but with more relapses). At first he said ok but 2 days later I didn't get anything and I ask him for the xanx and he says that he doesn't want to get on that troubles (becouse he knows that one time I found a bottle of xans and I took 10 in 2 days and the owner of my house who doesn't allow drugs had to break the door's latch to enter becouse I was asleep in his bed and didn't hear the doorbell and left the latch on so I almost got kicked out the house). 

But 4 days ago this guy gave me a 10 Valium. Ok nice I'm not going to protest its free. 
3 days ago he gave me 2 2mg xans. Great!  I was going to take 1 but ofter 1 an hour I took the other 1. I was disappointed bc I didn't feel much high. The next day I feel frustrated. That wasn't enough!! I relapsed for nothing!! And I had nothing left!!! 
But I didn't want to ask this guy for more even paying bc he's probably refusing. 

Yesterday I just though 'wtf am I trying to get xans when I started doing heroin bc benzos weren't enough anymore???'  

So today I walked +40 minutes, raining, debating into my head if I should get 5€ or 10€. I went to the same house as always and knocked the door but a women that I didn't recognized came out. I asked her anyway for the stuff but she that it was the next house. I apologized and knocked the next door. Twice. And the same women came again angry telling me that that was also her house that it wasn't there. And I just quickly got out there. 

I felt SO FUCKING ashamed. I feel horribly and so so so frustrated. +40 minutes of walking to go back home with my hands empty. 

So know I keep feeling that way now. I'm considering going out and ask to someone from the squat for xans. Or trying to get heroin again but I'm scared to knock that women's door again lol

I've also been lucky (or unlucky) to have using be incredibly easy for me to do the entire time financially. Anytime it's been a problem I'll put myself in a situation where it no longer is and I can keep using. I recently started trying to quit heroin again (after a traumatic experience a year ago with Subs put me off for a while) but realized I never fully commit myself. I have always thought that I wanted to quit but a lot of people tell me that maybe the reason I haven't succeeded is I don't want it enough. I'm starting to question myself. I have a list of negative things about heroin and reasons I want to quit, but I can also come up with a bunch of reasons I like it and could keep going. Do I not actually want to quit because it's so easy for me that why not keep getting high? Or is this just the way addiction works and my damaged brain is telling me I should keep using even though I don't actually want to? If an addict chooses to keep getting high after the initial experimentation period wears off and the brain is getting affected, does that mean they are choosing to because of the disease? That there's no chance free will is involved and they need to recognize that and get help? Or do some people just prefer getting high and they're just gonna be happier living their life high no matter what? I guess my question is does anyone just use to use? Cause they're happy doing so? Or is it always a feeling of failure and being ""stuck"" for whatever reason (i.e. cant get through the kick, cant stay sober, etc.), ya know like a submission to the drugs power, and giving up on quitting instead of ""choosing"" to keep getting high? I can't decide whether I'm stuck or just like getting high, and whether I'm trying to quit because I want to or cause I feel like I need to/have to. I also feel like maybe I'm a fuxking idiot that's enabling myself and letting others enable me to keep using and that obviously I want to quit and my brains just fucked up cause am I crazy who WANTS to keep using heroin but like apparently me right 🙃

I'm brand new to this group. I was searching for a group for some support in stopping opiates. (My username is not what I would have chose, but I accidentally let Reddit choose it for me, just FYI lol). 

Anyway, I have been taking tramadol off and on for the better part of ten years. I never take more than 400 mg and that would happen on a day when I was trying to get to the really high, but I've always been able to function well. I would say average days would be around 200-300mg. It's not a terribly large dose, but it also got me feeling pretty much on cloud nine many times. 

Someone started giving me tramadol for restless leg syndrome and when I took it I loved the calming and sense.of wellbeing effect it had on me. When I first got on it, it wasn't even a scheduled drug. It was passed out like tylenol in jails. I have dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression and that was greatly relieved. I honest don't think I would have gotten as far as I have in life without the help of the tramadol because it lessened my anxiety enough to function and build a resume and complete graduate school and have a career. I'm not glorifying my drug use by any means, but some times we just do what gets us through and then do better when we can and that's what I want to do now.

I know there are those who don't really take tramadol seriously because it is relatively mild compared to other opiates, but for me it seems to give me the good feelings that other people might get from more powerful opiates. Luckily, the other opiates, for me, give me negative effects.

I've been through these withdrawals before and they are hell. The worse part is the depression and anxiety that hits. The fight is two-fold with Tramadol because in addition to withdrawing from the opiate, you are also withdrawing from an SNRI that effects ""feel good"" neuro transmitters in the brain and withdrawing takes those away and your brain must learn to build that back up, leading to depression and anxiety in the mean time. I haven't started feeling that yet, but will know it when it gets here. 

Anyway, lastly, I just wanted to list my reasons for wanting to stop taking tramadol. Maybe it will help others in some way:

1. I want to quit for my health. I am chronically constipated. I depend on laxatives. There is no way this could be good for me in the long term. I've researched a lot about vitamins and minerals that our bodies need that just can't be absorbed when on pain pills. I want to see if this can help me to feel better, more energy, healthier, etc. I try to do healthy things in my day to day, but wonder how much good that's even doing when I'm on these pills. 

2. I don't want to get me or anyone in trouble and it could negatively impact employment.

3. I may want to have children. I obviously can't keep taking them if I do that and I can't be healthy for my family. 

If anyone else has some good reasons to quit, I would be happy to add them into the list. Perhaps to encourage others and even if they don't exactly fit my life, I can always find value in them.

I have done some things to prepare for this. Got potassium, magnesium, calcium, fruits (including bananas), imodium (I will not abuse like I've read, but just the recommended dosage), Gatorades and I do have some ativan for anxiety and restless legs (I will not take the ativan for more than five days...just enough to get me through the worst part of the physical detox. 

Anyway, I just found myself thinking of excuses for why I can't detox right now and there will always be a reason not to do it. ""If not now when"". I'm on a break from work and I just got over COVID-19, so nobody expects anything from me, so I can just lay low.

Something that helps me is to tell myself that I am going to give this a fair try and if it is absolutely unbearable, I will regroup and come up with another plan (maybe medically assisted detox), so idk, that just helps me feel like I'm not trapped. I also do have a small amount of Kratom on hand, just in case it need a little help...I'm kinda mixed on using it during detox because I don't just want to trade the tramadol for something else, but I have also heard that as long as you keep the dose low and very short term, you can get out free of both whatever opiate you were using and the Kratom. But also, I have the powdered Kratom and it is nasty...I've tried putting it in everything. I think orange juice has probably been the best option, but still...ew lol

Anyway, any support would be so greatly appreciated and I want to support everyone as much as I can. Any advice, tricks, critiques of my plan lol are all welcome. 

I've been embarrassed to share this with many people, particularly because of what I do for a living, which I don't know that I feel comfortable sharing, but suffice it to say, you'd think I should have it all together, given my work.

And I know that's irrational because anyone can struggle and we all will with something some time. Since the beginning of human history we have all looked for ways to distract ourselves from the  realities of the human condition, whether that is through a substance, exercising, work, video games. I guess what I'm saying is it's nothing to be embarrassed about and we should cut ourselves and others some slack.

So I just snort it but what I’m going to do I when I wake up do just a .1(btw I do about .3-.4 lines at a time) then wait 30mins an do another one an add 30 mins to ever time I do a .1 So by the time I’m doing my third .1 I’ve been  waiting a hour an half. Then the next one I have to wait 2 hours then 2 an half hours so by the third day I’m only doing it like 3 times a day. I have this thing called a kitchen safe it’s a small device that you put items in and have it lock for how ever long you want 30mins - 3days and you won’t be able to reach what you want.

I stopped checking your social media a long time ago, U/LK3000. Last night I got 3 hours of sleep before class. I was checking my phone before bed and the very first suggestion was you, AP. Its been so long since I've seen you that your memory was almost blurry in my mind but as soon as I saw those pictures everything came flooding back. All of the pictures of us when we were so happy, with our pupils pinned. Heroin turned you into a monster. I remember when you beat me in the crowded gas station parking lot in the middle of the day in front of our drug dealer because I wouldn't pull out more money from the atm. I remember burying my phone and running away with you, doing a shot mixed with your blood to show how dedicated I was to you.

 I loved you. You loved heroin more than me. I loved heroin more than you. When you told me you knew a dude that could get us free drugs, and then held me and cried in the car afterwards claiming you didn't know they were going to do that to me. That you didn't set it up. That you didn't drag me back to that house multiple times. You got to go peacefully, and exactly how you wanted to. I tried to save you, to save yourself. 

Today was my second intro to human services class, we're doing a presentation and my topic is the opioid epidemic. There's another guy in recovery from opiates in my class, so I picked him to be my partner. His name is Alex. My heart dropped. I nicknamed you AP because I was devastated over my ex, Alex. It feels like you're everywhere around me all the time.

 You got to go peacefully and I'm stuck with crippling anxiety and ptsd. Consumed with feelings of grief, guilt, sadness, anger. I hate things ended the way they did, I was trying to get clean and you wouldn't stop. After I went to treatment everything got so messy with us. I remember one night after I relapsed and used meth I felt so lost, and so scared running the streets by myself without you and Andrés to protect me.  I texted you a line from a favorite Bright Eyes song- ""But I realized that I need you, and I wonder if I could come home."" And as much as I'm still angry about every time you beat me, any time I spent my entire paycheck on enough to keep us well for the week just for you to use it all and help me look for it in the morning, when you nodded out and totaled my car, I still think about that sometimes. ""I wonder if I could come home"" You loved me so much, I know you did. You always told me I was the most beautiful girl in the world. That you thought I was an angel the first time I met you when I came to your pizza shop to buy xans. And now I can never go home. I hadn't talked to you for two months before you died. It fucking kills me knowing you probably died being upset about me. That you were using to kill the pain of me leaving you so I could get clean. I wanted this for you too AP, I wanted you to get better and be here with me. I'm crying my eyes out as I type this, if anyone is actually reading this thank you so much. I'm just so lost right now.",12,{'epidemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5873226}"

I haven't held to tight on to the path and recently came out of a 5 month relapse with heroin.

Since I became clean - with the exception of the 5 month relapse - I've more or less suffered from a bad stomach, mostly diarrhea in multiple colors: black, brown, yellow. I'd say 80% of the time it's diarrhea. 

I haven't been to concerned about it, thinking to myself it has been PAWS or just my system being screwed up because of many years of opiate use. 

But this morning it came out f***ing RED! Not quite the color of blood, but almost there, and certainly red enough to make me concerned. And after talking briefly with my mother later on, I found that different members of my family suffers from Crohns disease (inflammation in the guts or something).

Of course I'll try and call the doctor tommorrow and see if an appointment will be possible, but in the mean time I'd like to ask if anyone knows if opiate use could hold back symptoms and make it go unnoticed? I read that it runs in the family.

I'm not painting the devil on the wall here (perhaps a little, I am a pessimist), I know blood in the stool can have many different reasons and can be quite harmless, but I can't help to feel a little concerned, and I just know it will stick in the back of my mind until I have it checked.

My Oxy problem got bad quick, and continued getting worse for a couple years until I got on methadone. Originally , I planned to use methadone to get off of drugs altogether, but quickly started using it to just not get sick while I was between scores of dope.

Of course, methadone blocks a lot of the dope, so I ended up having to do even MORE dope to come anywhere near how high I got before. And then when I tested positive for opiates at the clinic, they’d increase my methadone dose!

Soon I was at 180+mg of methadone. I also picked up a bit of a benzo habit as on methadone, it fucked me up nicely.

That went on for a couple years.

Before I got on methadone, I had tried to go cold turkey a couple times and failed. Once, I even tried to go cold turkey off of methadone and HOLY SHIT, MISTAKE. It was WAY worse than getting off of regular opiates and would never try to do that again.... until I had to.

I had been evicted and was staying basically in my car, until I got super fucked up on Oxy, Xanax, Valium and somas, and crashed my car, ending in a dui arrest. I was in jail for a week, going cold turkey from methadone and everything else.

Longest. Week. EVER.

When I got out I was finally able to convince my mom to let me stay with her. I stayed in bed for about 3 weeks, and counting the first week in jail and a few subsequent days at my moms, I stayed up for 11 days, shaking, shivering, jerking my legs, running to the bathroom every twenty seconds, worst headache imaginable... it was PURE HELL. 

But it was also all the motivation I needed to never fuck up again. But even then I still had problems, I had been using since I was 15, and didn’t quit til I was 23. I had NOTHING, and was still essentially an emotional 15 year old. I stayed unemployed for a couple years at my moms. Eventually got a shitty job and started paying off my legal bills and fees to get my license back.

Within a few years I got my own car.... then my own house, then another car. Started a business. Met a great, great woman to share my life with, and I am happier than I have ever been.

Hi guys.
So after I opened up to my mother, who was my main source for the pills I started tapering. I failed miserably at tapering I'm afraid to say. It is like because I know this situation is coming to an end, as the supply use going to dry up soon I'm losing control with them. So I've even taken more than I used to.

But the joke is really on me because my mother has agreed to give me some pills but she is on control of how many I get an how often I get them. So even though I have upped my dose a little it just means I have even longer to go without them until I get some more. So she has given me 10 pills for the week and I have taken them all in 2 days. So I now have about 6 days until I get any more. 

But I'm still happy with the progress as before I was taking 6 pills a day and had continuous access to them so I just didn't stop unless I had to. (A messed up part of my brain even justified taking them all so I could dry up my supply so I had to do without. Of course I always took them all just in time for the prescription to be renewed). So now instead of a day or two until I get more, I have 6 days. I know I can manage it, it's the psychological element that is the hard part for me. 

Even though it is early days I can see a difference in my relationship to the pills. Because I know the supply is controlled and will at some point end I don't dread the days without as much. And Im starting to see them almost like a treat to have for a short time and then go back to 'normal' the same way as I would use beer or food. 

I cannot stress how good it feels to tell my mother this. I'm 33 but it still feels good to not lie to her. And she has been awesome. She is controlling the supply but is taking my requests seriously and trusts that I know what is best. She wonders whether to just cut me off but as I've explained it's not like I couldn't get more a number of other ways, but if I taper for a while i will gently get free of them. If I go CT I will get strong cravings and may succumb to them and find another source. At least now she knows what I'm taking and when. 

I had a proud moment yesterday too as I went to get my 10 pills and she left the room for a while and I had the box Infront of me. I was so tempted to take more and she wouldn't have noticed but I didn't. I'm pretty annoyed with myself right now as I'm out of pills but also proud, it's a strange feeling. 

I have also noticed some other effects from the pills I thought were just due to my depression and anxiety. I took a double amount today and actually noticed that though I felt good and still do a little bit, I also have big mood swings. Like anything that interferes with my high immediately makes me angry and frustrated. Things that may have just been annoying really put me in a rotten mood, so even though I feel happy and content due to the codeine, I also feel really bitterly angry too the moment anything negative happens. This can be losing on a video game or a colleague doing something petty. I knew I had mood swings before but thought they were due to withdrawal effects or my own mental issues, not as a direct effect of the high. 

It also makes my depression so much worse. 

I also came clean to my therapist. This was almost as hard as talking to my mother. After I got her to promise she would not tell anybody else I told her everything. She agreed that I'm taking the right steps and to keep at it. I didn't know this but her previous job was a substance abuse therapist so she is very knowledgeable about this stuff.

I told her that I'm trying very hard firstly to acknowledge that I have a problem, and that even though I'm not as bad as many I've seen and talked to. That I can't fall for the trap of using that as a justification to keep going. But also that I'm trying to not feel ashamed about this. I haven't hurt anybody, not stolen anything anybody needed or caused pain to anybody but myself. 

She actually made my cry when she first asked for permission to break from the professional role for a moment and told me that she thought I was a lovely person and that with this on top of my other issues about self esteem that I should take a step back and acknowledge that actually I'm a very nice, thoughtful and considerate person. That her job was to make me realise these things on my own but that for once she felt like just saying it as I have this idea that I'm a 'bad person' and not deserving of good things. 

I sound very full of myself writing that but it did move me to tears and actually gets me writing this now. I've had these issues for so long and I can see now how my addiction has affected my self issuing all this time. 

So right now I feel ok. I'm still dreading the last time I can get pills, but knowing I will have some more in a week makes getting through the next week much easier without them. In a way a lot of it is the anticipation as the high with the amount I take isn't very intense, 2 beers feels stronger than this. 

I also need to get better at processing negative emotions as since I was 20ish I used the pills to numb those feelings. And negativity is a big trigger for me. Even getting up in the morning sometimes is really hard when you hate your job and feel like a failure every day. 

But things seem to be moving in the right direction, so one day at a time. My war is my mentality and controlling my emotions and that will only come with time. Fingers crossed.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.50618714}"

So far this has only lead me to repeated failure and one suicide attempt. Is it possible to be prescribed Suboxone as a sort of compromise, rather than just die?","So I understand Suboxone exists for opiate dependant people who can’t come off them.

I’ve been being told by my doctors that Targin is a short term medication and that I must come off it, but every time I’ve tried I haven’t been able to, with disastrous consequences. The pain I suffer from (Akathisia, a very very unusual and intense reaction to certain dopamine-depleting medications) is so bad that the first time I was made to attempt coming off I ended up buying nitrogen gas to kill myself, but was reported by the seller and I was locked up. 

After being released, the doctors are still very insistent on having me come off, but the pain is so indescribably unbearable (it’s like this constant insatiable urge to tear your skin off, as if you’re trapped inside a prison of your own body and you’re going mad with the urge to get yourself out) that I know I’ll just end up resorting to killing myself again, but this time planning things out so it has no possibly way of going wrong. 

If I express just how bad and terrifying the pain is, in an attempt to have them not force a withdrawal on me, I know I’ll just get locked up again ‘for my own good’.  So it seems like my options are either go along with the withdrawal until I eventually snap, or find some sort of compromise that a doctor might agree to.  I don’t know if suboxone is the compromise I’m looking for, as I don’t know all that much about it, but I’m just desperate for anything.  Is there any way I can plea my case to some medical body or something and ask to get this prescribed?  Or any way to bring it up with my (not very understanding) GP?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.87550884}"

Fingers crossed it's negative but if my GM has a clearly asymptomatic case then who knows I could too. Luckily I got some things around the house I can do today to keep myself busy.  

I ain't even gotten in the shower yet (I'm sitting in the bathroom about to as I type this lol) but this morning I went on a lil YouTube hole listening to old songs I used to fuck w which is always fun. I found [this](https://youtu.be/MIszAdIHLpw) song (TW TW TW reaaaally descriptive mentions of heroin use and being strung out) which is a fucking great rap song and I love, but realized that the last time I listened to it was about 3 years ago living in Vegas, right after R had gotten locked up and I was really trying to kick before I moved back to the east coast. I did two 2wk stints of being kinda clean (ie I was on subs and not doing dope but using my subs super irresponsibly even shooting them up n shit), the first time I relapsed because I did a bunch of meth with my homeboy and inevitably couldn't handle the comedown w.o the help of opiates (a good reason to stay away from ALL hard drugs and not just your DOC!) And the second time was because I listened to this damm song thinking I'd be fine but no it legit put me in a head space where I instantly went down to the tent city by the freeway near our house and copped.  

I mention this because I was actually trepidatious clicking on this song just now to listen to it; I was like bitch this song legit made u relapse in the past so BE CAREFUL. Ofc I have literally 42x as much clean time now as I did then (including using my subs fully as prescribed like medication and not drugs lol) so the situation is a lil different but still. The song did not make me want to relapse whatsoever, in fact it had the opposite effect. Since the last time I heard it was back in Vegas, at the beginning of what I'd consider the very very worst of my entire addiction around early 2018 (by far the worst year of my life), instantly images from around that time started popping into my head. Me sitting in my car in the back of some parking lot, struggling to find a vein that's not totally shot under the dim car light. Driving back to the house and nodding tf out at every red light. That panicky feeling you get when you're not physically dopesick just yet but your mind knows it's been too long since you've shot up and starts to dip into that dark and awful place. Waiting for the dealer with my heart in my fucking throat feeling like I'm gonna shit myself.  

When I heard the song and it made me relapse, I think that was because back then, the things the song was describing (just like general day to day junkiedom lol) felt completely inevitable. Being clean felt like a lie and a charade, and I truly felt destined for destitution (a phrase I nearly got tattooed on me back in the day, if that tells you anything about how I used to view myself lmaooo). I literally could not even imagine a life that didn't revolve around copping, getting high, and hustling up the money to be able to do so. But now- despite never truly losing sight of it and being able to, in a healthy way, remind myself that the demon is still always lurking behind me- that way of living feels like an old fever dream; like a different version of myself. It's still me, sure, and the junkie me is fully 100% an assimilated part of who I am today, but being able to put that distance between the hopeless, broke, scarred up arms and legs heroin addict I was in 2018 and the fairly well adjusted, decently happy, and even reasonably successful woman I am today is something that for so many years I never thought I could do.   

I used to dream of the kind of life im living now, but that's all it was-a dream- because the idea of it ever actually being a reality just felt so... inauthentic. All I had ever been in my entire life, early childhood included, was capital-B Bad. I was a Bad Kid, a Difficult Teenager, and I literally wrote in my diary at age 12 that I knew I was gonna be a heroin addict someday if that tells you anything lmao. It's no wonder I wanted to get ""destined for destitution""tattooed on my body, because all my life that's what was drilled into my brain, starting with the adults around me as a child and continuing as a self fulfilling prophecy.  

 The fact that ive actually been able to get to a point in my life where that Bad Girl homeless junkie is still *me*, but instead of acting out and living that life she just kinda peacefully lives inside of me, not like an invasive tumor but like an organ that's always been there, is something I'll always be extremely grateful for. I used to laugh in ppls faces when they came at me with the whole ""recovery is a long journey that takes years even decades"" type of shit, but that's because back then I was too wrapped up in my active addiction to even begin to realize the myriad of underlying reasons for it dating all the way back to the literal beginning of my life and existence. I know it's a cliche thing to say, but only now, nearly 2 years into being off dope, am I starting to realize how long of a ~journey~ it really is. I don't mean that to sound daunting, because it's not a shitty journey. Ofc physical wds are awful and horrible, and ofc what with reaching into the dusty closets of your brain and busting out the filing cabinets marked CHILDHOOD TRAUMA etc you ain't always gonna have a good time (lmao, but fr tho), but overall, for me at least, the deeper mental part of my recovery has been seriously eye opening, and mostly enjoyable- esp for a bitch like me that needs to be able to pragmatically name and examine psychological aspects of mine and others' beings in order to feel secure, safe, and somewhat in control.  

Well fuck, this was long and obnoxious. No surprises there though 🤣 how is everyone else doing today? I hope y'all are having a nice and relaxing Sunday afternoon. And for those of y'all that are still in the first few weeks, days, or even hours, I promise you this: it may feel like you're being dragged through the depths of your own personal hell right now- trust me, I've been there- and when you're staring down the void without the cushion of drugs to quell the darkness of your brain it can seem like a terrifying and insurmountable endeavor. But it's not. No matter how hard it gets, keep going, because on the other side of hell is a beautiful life and amazing version of yourself that you never could've imagined would even be able to exist, let alone actually thrive and enjoy life. But that person is still there within you, and every next minute that you go without dope, that person comes closer and closer to the surface. It is the most difficult thing you will ever do, I won't lie. But it'll also be by far 110% the BEST thing you ever do, and I can hands down promise you that.

I've been steadily using more and more over the past two, two and a half years. Starting with a couple percs every day, until suddenly I realized I wasn't even able to get high anymore, even though I was snorting ten perc 30s a day. Which, of course, is not cheap. We all know where it goes from there. 

So, knowing that if I didn't get help I was going to end up dead, I came clean. I had been hiding for so long, my family knew something was up but had no idea what it really was. But they didn't judge. They weren't angry, they showed me so much love and support and with that support, I put myself into detox. The staff at the facility I went to where some of the most compassionate, caring people I've ever encountered in my life. I feel like a brand new person and I never want to go back to the black pit I was living in everyday. 

7 days ago at exactly this time I was walking through the front doors at Swift River, so high on fentanyl I didn't know my ass from my elbow. After 3 days of complete and utter hell, I actually started to feel a little bit better. Another 2 days and it was like I could feel my self starting to come back. My REAL self, not the zombie version that didn't care about anything except for where my next fix was coming from. And things just keep getting better. By the time my dad picked me up yesterday morning I felt new, like I was being reborn. 

I woke up this morning in my own bed, my cats all snuggled up with me. I sat up and took a deep breath through my nose, which is finally starting to work again. I stood up and for the first time in as long as I can remember my entire body didn't scream in agony, demanding something to kill the pain. My stomach wasn't rolling over, nauseous and sweaty until I would somehow cram my first hit of the day on my nose, a $40 poison just to get through the day. 

Instead I stood up and stretched, actually happy to be alive. I had coffee with my best friend (who helped me make the decision to go to detox), and I'm about to go see my mom completely sober for the first time in over 2 years. I can't remember the last time I felt this much emotion, so much gratitude and excitement for the future. 

There's a light at the end of the tunnel. I know that I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I know now that I can do it because I finally have the support of my family and friends and a whole team of people behind me.

Shitty part is I'm going to have to work through this one but at least it's only a 4 day week for me. I work in IT as a system admin and just so happen to be on call this week so have to work more then normal, my luck sucks.

First off, kudos and I tip my hat, I do not know how you guys were able to do that. but with the right tools in the right determination I think I’m also capable of it. 

but I think what keeps pulling me back is the fact that I live with my family. and I’ve been trying to keep it under wraps. So I will wake up and then not be capable of showing my face because I can barely get out of bed and I have a low appetite. So then I justify going to cop so that I can show face and not worry them. 

so I guess my question is is those of you that successfully detox at home did you inform your family members for those of you that live with family during your detox did you inform them and keep them in the loop? and if so how did you explain it to them and how did they take it. any other tips or advice are welcome.

i’ve been failing over and over trying to do it on my own and even when I go to detox I completed it once and as soon as I got home a couple days later i used. I really don’t wanna go to a state run detox much less a rehab I’ve been to over 20 rehab so I feel like I just need to apply the information I learned in there. but also realistically it might be good to have the space away from drugs even if it’s only 30 to 60 days.

2021-01-16 00:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/kyd6m1/a_quick_update_and_reflection/,A Quick Update and Reflection,"Hey guys,

This last year I was pretty regular here.  Especially at the beginning. I was all about moving forward and doing my daily work to stay clean.. and I did! However I have noticed myself becoming a bit lazy lately as I’ve stopped going to the gym and running, starting smoking tobacco more, stopped writing in my journal.. etc. it feels like I’m reverting back to my old ways even though I did break free, but I’m scared I might return to what was killing me. I have to get back on the train and not forget how truly terrible it was back then. I’m hoping this post might help give me some accountability to continue my recovery into 2021. 

Oh and pro tip: find a new “healthy” addiction if you can! I returned to my mycology passion and started a business supplying hobby mushroom growers with supplies, equipment, and knowledge and it really checks all the boxes that chasing the blue roxys did. Now, when I’m done with my day job I have my business to continue working on and there is never a moment where I feel bored or empty because I have that fire to fuel. 

And to be honest, I am on suboxone. I know it’s confrontational here sometimes, but for me personally, I need it. At least for now. I’ve been on it for 6 months and have started a very very VERY slight taper down but I expect to be on it for at least another six months. I tried to cold turkey, but relapsed and nearly died so for me I believe that MAT really is essential for some, but everyone’s recovery is different and whatever way works for you is good. Any kind of recovery is better than not and you are perfectly splendid in any way you do it.  

Also tomorrow is my 27th birthday and I’m just so happy to be alive to see it. Thanks for reading and love you all.  Feel free to message me if I resonate with you. 

Quick summary of my addiction: blue fake oxy pressed with fent. Started in late high school and college, snorting got up to 2-3 pills in a day. Hospitalized once with a stroke which they aren’t sure if the OD caused or not.  I was found unconscious and the doctors had to call my mom telling her they weren’t sure if I was going to make it. Came out of the hospital a week later and could hardly walk, but was excited to have hit my bottom.. although it wasn’t. I ended up back on them, getting addicted again but this time with the added dangers of trying to get clean on my own without help.  This caused me to relapse, And OD again.  You know.. blue in the face,unconscious, and with the girl I was with having to face this trauma of some guy she was about to fuck falling off the side of her bed and her trying to wake him up but to no avail.  That time I awoke after two Narcan shots In the ambulance and with my arms strapped down I had to look the EMT in the eyes and literally and physically admit that I wasn’t in control and that I needed help.  Bonus points are the added embarrassment of having to go through this a second time. 

You see, the first time was a fluke. The pill batch was bad and I got a “hot spot” of fent in one of the pills that caused the OD.. or at least that’s what I told myself. Even after that first near death experience I still thought I had it under control, but I didn’t and nearly lost my life again.  EVEN THEN I felt like I never got the actual “closure” of quitting the drug. So I bought a couple more. Carefully I did them and then went on to get clean. I got with a therapist/drug counselor online, started MAT, and started running, playing tennis, and doing all the things I could to try and build a life around the metaphor of fitting systems at a table (in my mind it’s a picnic table at a park).  At the head is me and everyone else seated there is a player in my life. A significant other sometimes sits there, my friend group is another person there, my therapist joins in, physical activity has a spot, and my mushroom business takes up two spots, nearly pushing over the smallest person at the table named Fent.  Fent is there, but he doesn’t get to partake in the awesome lunch we all made together.  He tries to partake, but someone at the table stops him. When he tries to speak, another speaks over him. No one likes Fent, but we can’t rid him completely because that’s the addiction. It will always be there but every day he gets smaller and weaker.  

So that’s how I manage.  It’s worked so far although the table itself needs a bit of a clean up. I think I’ll start my birthday tomorrow with a good jog at the park. Thanks for reading guys. Love you all!

2021-01-15 20:40:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ky94my/attempting_bernese_method/,Attempting Bernese Method,"So here’s where I’m at. Last week I started taking .5 pieces every night while still getting high. On a random work day last week I took multiple .5 pieces over the course of the day while doing small bumps between them. Fast forward to this week. First two days this week I took 1MG pieces, followed by fent throughout the day. 30 mins after I took the 1MG pieces I would get terrible anxiety, cold sweats, RLS in my arms. I would dose small bumps till it went away. That happened mon-wed. Wednesday night I took a 1MG piece and didnt really feel any bad effects. So thurs morning I decided to up it to 2MG. Felt the same effects coming on and did bumps till it went away. However this time when my fent wore off, I didnt feel the urge to hurry and take more. My withdrawals didnt kick in within 3 hours like usual. W/d symptoms seem to come on after I dose a sub, then after I take some fent an hour after its like Im okay for the rest of the day instead of having to dose every 3 hours. Friday morning (today) I took 2mg. Waited for the anxiety and hot flashes to start. There was none. So I took another 1mg piece. 30 mins later the symptoms started. Figured it would fade within a few hours and Id be safe to take more subs. Made it through 2 hours of work before the coldness, hot flashes/sweating, and RLS in my arms made me cop some more fent. Did a small bump and I was fine for the next 5 hours. Probably coulda made it longer but I decided to do more just cuz I had it. 

So heres my question. Am I having W/D symptoms after dosing sub in the morning when the fent is already worn off because I need MORE sub? Am I feeling fent withdrawal and not taking enough sub to combat it? Am I safe to maybe just jump up to like 8mg? I have about 3-4mg of sub in me as of today. More than that if the subs from this week are still in my brain. How much sub do I need to have in me before its safe to just start taking as much sub as I want? 

The last time I quit I switched to oxys for 3 days, went to bed, woke up and took .5 of sub and felt fine, so I took 2mg an hour later and the sub worked its magic. 

This time it seems 3mg is either causing w/d symptoms or not enough to stop w/d symptoms. 
Idk Im in a weird spot rn. I should mention none of my sub doses have thrown me into full blown PWD. Idk. I take a lil 2mg piece, feel shitty and fatigued af, really cold but sweaty, get the urge to shit sometimes, slight RLS in my arms (the worst part for me) Then take a small bump of fetty and Im perfectly fine for the rest of the day. No withdrawals, no super bad urge to get high. When I was just on fent I would start feelin shitty after 3-4 hours.

2021-01-15 13:17:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/ky0bi2/just_reflecting_on_drug_usage/,Just reflecting on drug usage,"I think what non-addicts fail to realize is that drugs or alcohol work really well in the beginning for addicts. I remember my first few times doing oxy, I was able to get to class on time, social interactions felt less forced, it was easier to wake up in the morning and get going, school work was easier, depression and anxiety were gone, and a bunch of other positive effects. But as we all know, eventually you feel like you are treading water and it keeps getting harder and harder to keep your head above the water. It takes longer for some than others, and some people do dive head first into oblivion after first usage, but for me personally and many addicts I’ve spoken to, it begins as a very functional relationship. 


I have 2 years clean from opioids, but about a year in I used Xanax for a brief period. Same thing: work interactions were easier, cold calls were so easy, everyone loved me and I loved talking to people. Life felt easy and it felt like I was on a super drug. I should’ve known better because of my history but I was shooting for productivity and Xanax was providing that. It was a quick crash and burn. 


I find it really interesting how other people view drug addiction, hell before I was a drug addict I probably viewed it the same. Unfortunately drugs work really well until they don’t, and then you are hooked on them and you are fucked anyways. But my first few times doing oxy, heroin, Xanax, cocaine, etc. wasn’t underwhelming necessarily but it was kind of like oh this is pretty manageable. With oxy it was the best feeling I’d ever had, but I wasn’t nodding out, I wasn’t drooling on myself, no one even knew that I had taken it. That was what really fucked me, I figured these drugs would be so good that I wouldn’t be able to handle doing them that much, almost like shrooms or something. I mean I knew they were addictive, but once I took them I was like oh shit this is super functional and can enhance my life.

I think the theme here is, I was always looking for that something extra. Something to make life easier, that Superman pill, social lubricant, a performance enhancer if you will, a way of dulling the sharp edges of life, easing nerves, boosting confidence, a way to basically not feel like myself but an “enhanced version” of myself. It provided me with an optimistic indifference that allowed me to separate myself from being tied to the final results of situations, events, school/work performance, etc. 

What has been the biggest asset in my recovery is learning how to take a step back and assess how I may be feeling that I’m not adequate, and then making the necessary changes to address those issues. I am enough as just myself. But not just because I say that that and it manifests in me, I am actively working to improve all of those deficiencies each day and each obstacle is a learning experience. We can’t feel great all of the time, and we can’t always control how we are going to be feeling by popping a pill or doing a drug, and that’s OK. Growth comes when we don’t want to do something, maybe we aren’t feeling particularly good that day, don’t want to go out and see/talk to people, have a lot of anxiety or nerves about something, and we get out and do our best anyways. And usually, it goes better than we expected. If it doesn’t, we can take a step back and figure out how to be better next time",128,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39845678}"

It was the last thing I expected to be questioned about.  I did my best to answer their 3-4 specific questions, but honestly my drug use years feel like several lifetimes ago and a huge blur.

I’m worried I’m getting fired.  They said they’d give me an update in 2-3 weeks.  Until then, I guess I just try to put it out of my mind but it’s all I can think about and I’m so stressed out.

I've been taking tramadol on and off for about 6 years now. I'm 24 years old and pretty depressed. I know tramadol contributes to it. But everytime I go off (and honestly I know in myself that I'm not quitting, just taking a break) the depression gets so much worse and I have no healthy coping mechanisms in life. 

Tramadol, benzodiazepam and another opiat that I don't know what's called in the US but I have in my home country is what I've been taking.

It's small doses. 50/100 a day 4 times a week, but would definitely do it everyday if I had enough pills.

I'm just so sick of myself. Not knowing myself. Life is getting past me and all I do is sit in my apartment comfortably numb with my high. Rewatching old shows over and over. Not a life.
I don't have hobbies. Not much friends.
There are a lot I want for myself in life but I won't get it if I continue like this.

I've become a shitty person I don't recognise. I'm moody and rude to the people who love me. I lie. I manipulate to get what I want. I'm so ashamed and I don't want to be this person anymore.

I have a therapist but I can't and will never tell him that I have these issues. Can't have this stuff in my record for the rest of my life. 
There are no NA in my town. 

I have one friend who wants to help. He was in rehab last year and have been able to stay sober. 


And my other question which I hope will be motivating

When will my brain (dopamine/serotonin levels) return to a normal healthy place? Is it possible?

Preparing to leave an abusive marriage and finally had enough of waking up sick and planning each day around pills. I started tapering and was holding at the last 15mg of Hydrocodone per day for about 10 days now.

UPDATE- 
The last few mgs was too tough. I started thinking about it too much (when should I take it? I need to save it for x,y,z or whatever activity) I decided last night was my last pill and i've been strong today. The withdrawals are pretty mild since i've been shivering, cold, sweaty, heavy etc for the past month. I know I am landing a lot softer than usual and am so thankful I was able to get down as far as I did.

I think by Monday it should mostly be mental and i'm ready and not ready. My situation is making this almost impossible- Husband still doesn't know I quit, I have the pills in my hand as I take them from him and have to trash them. I want them when he's around so that I can continue to numb myself and zone out...so I drank a glass of wine the other night to be pleasant enough that evening and that dissapointed me. I didn't know it at the time, but this is the reason I started in the first place. I think he knew that all along and that is heartbreaking. 

The good though- I don't need them to be a Mom. I am a great Mom with great kids and I want to be present for all of it. They don't need me speeding around cleaning and ""getting things done."" They just need me to be present, healthy, and strong.

It’s me, L. Some of you may remember me as I posted on here a lot between 6 and 10 months ago and then stopped posting. Well, it’s been an up and down time. 

When I first stopped using I had NO IDEA how to handle my emotions at all. I was extremely suicidal and was having hallucinations as well. Thankfully, due to some kind friends I went to a psychiatric facility where I discovered what some of the underlying issues are that trigger my drug use. I don’t want to trigger anyone so I won’t discuss what happened in the past, but I was diagnosed with BPD and have been doing cognitive behavioral therapy to help. I honestly don’t know if it did anything. Maybe it did maybe it didn’t. The only thing that brought me joy from quitting drugs was saving money, the rest was shame. 

SO. MUCH. SHAME. The feeling of “why didn’t j quit earlier!?” triggers these horrible thoughts that push me closer and closer to relapse. That and the mind numbingness of my days. No one and nothing to live for. 

Well...after a few months of doing okay, I said “just this once, I have it under control...” WHAT. A. FUCKING. MORON. How many times have I said that only to wind up thousands more dollars in debt, at the end of the road, the only difference now is an even BIGGER desire to kill my self. 

Well, after this relapse I went into yet another psych hospital as I was having a fucking MELTDOWN. I basically detoxed in there without any pain, but in my infinite genius I spent a few days using again as a “last hoorah.” I know I am beyond stupid, I’m a moron. But here I am. Back on day 1. 

Honestly...I’ve done this so many times I know this won’t be my last day 1. I’m REALLY struggling to see the point of anything. Why does anyone go on, after years of trying and failing. Knowing you’re the biggest loser society has to offer, the butt of jokes - a literal heroin addict. I contemplated paying someone to shoot me, then j realized life isn’t a movie and there’s no way I could get someone to do that. If there were though...I’m lucky to be here but I’m certainly not thankful. Fuck me.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82440174}"

I have found clean time through MAT. With my new work schedule, 8-5, I have had to go in the morning. I’m also a parent so I have to drop the children off before I do either activity.

I am late to work because of it. At first I would say it’s my mismanagement of time but now, it is because the appointments are taking way longer than necessary. I had a write up my first month about it, yay me 😳, and corrected my behavior. But now, twice in the same week, I have had surprise UA and blood draws that have made me late to work by 10 minutes. I don’t want to blame the traffic but it does impede me as well. I told the person I report to today the truth about how I go every morning and how I have tried to go during lunch but that backfired as well due to the traffic. That person ended up going on about how they now don’t trust me and is going to go through all of my time sheets to make sure they’re correct.. which they have no reason not to be correct so I don’t exactly understand the threat except that they wanted to make a point that they do not trust me anymore. I only presented it to let them know that the first meeting didn’t fall on deaf ears, that I acknowledge what’s transpiring, the truth of the matter and how I was correcting it. But now, it’s turned to that I’m an untrustworthy drug addict.. because I told him I was late due to my kids and not anything medical..

I had ADA paperwork filled out before for my mental illness back in the day. Am I able to get this done for my doctors appointments as well? I just don’t know how to handle this. I don’t want to be fired because i need the job but I also don’t want to make this any worse than it is.

I’m asking this question because I’m currently struggling SO HARD to get 2 weeks clean before I can get on Vivitrol. I can’t sleep and I can’t keep any food/water down which is making it quite hard to make it to the 2 week mark. I keep relapsing just so that I can get a night worth of sleep or so that I can eat a meal and keep it down. Hell my doctor even thinks that my weed dealer is lacing bud with opiates/fetty, causing me to remain in a constant state of  detox. I’m so dehydrated that my body is having s hard time processing/digesting drugs. For example, I took 1mg of a sub about a week ago so I could have even just one night of reprieve and I pissed hot for the sub a week later, making it so I couldn’t get the Vivitrol shot. 

So long story short, I’m considering changing goals. I used to want to be on Vivitrol and put all this shit behind me but because I can’t seem to get to the two week sober mark, I might  just get on subs and live indefinitely on those. I really don’t want to take the sub route though. If they work for you, that’s great. But I’d rather not have the constant reminder every morning that I used to be a junkie and that if I decide to not take a strip just this one time I can go get high. 

How did you manage to get on Vivitrol? I want nothing more than to be done with this hell of a lifestyle but 2-3 weeks of not being able to keep a single calorie down, of constant panic attacks, of no sleep, of constantly restless legs/arms, is just too much. I know I sound like a pussy saying that and that I just need to push through. I should just go to a month long rehab but I would lose my job.

I have been using codeine for far, far, far too long. It's going on so many years now that it's actually scaring me and I don't understand how I haven't had any major damage to my body.

To give some background, I'm in the UK and I've been getting my fix through OTC meds such as Solpadeine and Nurofen Plus (for those not familiar, the codeine content is something like 12mg per tablet). 

This is my current dosage.

Solpadeine: 10 a day
Nurofen: 15 a day

It's embarrassing having to plot different routes to different pharmacies so they don't catch on (I'm almost positive they know) and it's costing me an absolute fortune.

I bit the bullet and phoned my GP in tears saying I needed help, I badly needed help as I didn't know what to do. The response so far has been a little underwhelming if I'm being honest.. or maybe I expected too much? I got bloods taken and everything came back fine somehow, I don't understand how there is no damage to my liver and he confirmed it. For treatment, he has asked me to reduce my dosage to the RDA.. so 4 Solpadeine and 6 Nurofen a day and I'll be honest, I'm struggling. He said I should seek a therapy group to talk to people but it's not easy doing that in Covid and I'm a key worker during this mess too so I don't have the luxury of time at my disposal :/

I get that warm tingle in my spine all the way to my forehead when my dosage changes and its like a sign that I need to take more. I hate the feeling.

I have bought some immodium as I hear it's good for possible withdrawal but I'm not sure what else I can do to help taper down to the RDA. Does anyone have any suggestions from experience as what is the best way around this?

After using heroin for many years, my bf is in recovery. He's now 4 months clean since the last relapse which wasn't as bad as the relapse before. It's all going in the right direction, and he's doing amazingly. He's on MAT, and has been working through some mental and physical health issues. I find his courage and determination so inspiring.


Recently, he's started drinking alcohol again. It's not usually his DOC, though he did drink daily for a couple of months last year before relapsing. He really enjoys making nice cocktails and usually only has a couple, though he sometimes struggles to stick to his intended max. It also tends to be maybe 4-5 evenings a week.


I'm just wondering what other people's experiences are of drinking in recovery. I know it's entirely his decision and I'm not looking to interfere. But I'm feeling pretty anxious and sometimes despondent about it, as another relapse would be hard on both of us, and our relationship is still recovering from the last one.

Does anyone have the occasional drink without it affecting their recovery? How soon after getting clean did you start drinking? Hoping you can give me some hope!

Or did anyone try, and it led them to relapse? Just trying to work out what to expect.

I'm so so grateful for having this chance again, last time I did a full withdrawal, was the initial lockdown - now I don't believe in God, but during that time, I felt that somebody, somewhere, had given me a chance to change my life (not having to work for 6 weeks, giving me time to withdraw and recover) - I thought, I'm never going to get this chance again.

I’m from Massachusetts where it’s easier to find a bag of dope then it is to find a parking spot. I feel like shit but writing about it makes it a little easier. So I got into drug culture pretty early around 14 just smoking a lil weed here and there until a friend showed me how much money was in it. When I got out of high school breaking down lbs turned into shipping them cross country. I was making flights to Cali on the weekly. In the height of everything I started having G.I. issues and some quack of a doctor prescribed me vikes 10mg which I’m told binds up your stomach even more. Eventually I became so dependent on them I couldn’t even eat without them or I’d puke. So eventually I said fuck it. I got enough cash where if I need to take a pill every few hours it’s no biggy. So eventually I hand the business over to my boy (obviously still taking a cut) because I’m tired of trying to find ways to smuggle vikes and perks with me through airports. My habit got worse so I eventually started breaking perk 30s in half and sniffing them with coke so I wouldn’t nod. I’m clearly not medicating for pain anymore, now I’m just getting high. I soon learned that my partner lossed a shipment and is trying to pin a 150000 dollar debt on me. Dude gave them my parents address and everything. So at this point I’m freaking the fuck out taking more drugs to try and calm down to assess the situation but I end up passing out from too much xanax. I wake up to my ex all coked the fuck out and come to find out this chick sent herself into a psychosis. Now I get a phone call from the connect all pissed off while my ex is trying to run outside naked so I hang up with no explanation. Now they’re really pissed so I’m trying to negotiate for my life. I end up setting them up with a local buyer south from them to make up for the loss. My ex ends up in a mental hospital and her parents pretty much make it impossible for me to see her. I move back with my parents and try and find a new hustle. At this time I’m sniffing at least 3 perks at a time just to feel anything and I have no income so I’m looking for ways to cut back. I started hearing about perk 30s for 6 dollars a piece which is unheard of from where I’m from they go from 20 to 50 a pop depending on how many you buy at a time. What I didn’t know was they were pressed fentanyl pills. That first half a perk sent me flying and I knew I didn’t want anything else. So I start selling the powder made more money faster than I ever had and locally which was a big plus for me. I had a friend who drove people to the methadone clinic and right after drop them at my house for there fix. Eventually everyone got used to the product including myself and wasn’t getting high so I started buying pure car fentanyl and that shit is no joke. Big ass white rocks that you have to crush in a blender for at least 10mins to turn to powder. Stuff is so strong I was making a batch and my girlfriend accidentally inhaled the fumes and o.d the paramedics had to hit her with narcane 7 times before she came back. I started making the batches stronger 1 to 7 and I’m doing at least two gs a day. As I’m progressing further I found myself being able to rail a gram line of the raw. I’m doing dumb shit like going to my drops high as fuck walking down the street with like 50k or more. Dropping thousands in money and drugs in front of my new apartment on the regular. Honestly don’t know how I’m not in jail. Finally my connect starts seeing my downward fall and cuts me off by holding me at gun point and stealing back some of his product. I’m at 10gs a day at this point and I gotta keep going or I’m gonna get sick but I can’t find a product that’s as good as what I had so I finally decide to get clean. Before that I tired to help my customers get clean and succeeded for the most part. Finally it was my turn I got to my first 24 hrs cold turkey on Halloween and tired to take an 8mg sub. Worst mistake! I started puking and shitting myself at the same time I immediately went to the er and got put into a rehab. I’m 2 and half months clean from fentanyl and I’m not gonna lie I still miss it but screw going through that headache.",0,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8327149}"

so i first got off it july 6th and went to a detox facility i ct'd originally off like 195 and at day 6 i was given subutex and i had the worst withdrawals ever was losing my mind going nuts but the doctor felt it wasnt really precipitated withdrawal though cause apparently my pupils wernt dialated lol that it was a mental thing like anxiety well regardless iv been scared to even touch subs since then since for the entire day i wanted to die and refused to take it again.

i got clean and was off methadone for 5 months then during the holidays for a week straight i used methadone again but around 40 mg a day vs the super high dose i was first on and sadly it threw me right back into withdrawal days later

im going to a detox /rehab facility for a month and im sure they will want to give me subs for a taper but i fear that happening again i guess it really would be mental after 15 days huh

I’m not expecting it to be easy regardless but for anyone who’s been through something similar I just was curious exactly how much SUCK to prepare for here.

I tried getting into a short term methadone detox but to my surprise I pissed clean for opiates so I’m guessing I have been shooting opioid RC’s (around 0.5G a day). Anyway I have an 8mg suboxone and am planning to take that after I quit the dope and go into WD’s. I would then follow with some kratom. 

1. I’m guessing 16-24hr since my last shot to begin the sub. 
2. I was planning on the following sub schedule 
   Day 1: 3mg
   Day 2: 2mg
   Day 3: 1mg
   Day 4: 1mg
   Day 5: 1mg

What are your thoughts? Shouldn’t switching from a short acting to long acting opiate lessen my WD symptoms?
Does my suboxone dosage seem correct?

Hello!

My name is Rachel, I am a Study Coordinator at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. We are currently recruiting participants for a paid research study looking at a new way to access buprenorphine/Suboxone or naltrexone/Vivitrol in a community pharmacy setting. This is a 3-month study, called the MATPharm study, comparing usual care to a new care approach at 6 pharmacies in Rhode Island. The pharmacies have the capacity to provide telehealth care and the study offers transportation assistance to medication appointments.

The goal of this study is to expand access to these medications in areas where it is difficult for individuals with opioid use disorder to receive treatment.

Part of the study is completing interviews and you will receive cash for answering questions about your health and telling us about your experience in the study.

If you are currently prescribed buprenorphine/Suboxone or naltrexone/Vivitrol in Rhode Island, you may be eligible for this study. Please call or text 401-408-6451 or 401-473-9286 for more information or fill out this brief survey and we will contact you if you are eligible:

Since then Ihave had a real problem with them and nobody knows. 

I just came clean to her today that I have been taking them and developed a problem with them. She has given me some more to help me taper but I gave her my old house key and told her to keep it for a while until I cab be trusted again. I told her everything and asked her to hid or throw away all the new pills she gets at least for a while so I can't go near them. 

I thought I would feel nervous about telling her but I don't. I still have a problem but I am ready to stop taking these things and get back to being in control of myself again. 

I started tapering recently but this feels like the best thing I could have done. I thought she was going to kill me but she was fine with it, even said she was proud that I was able to open up about it and take steps to sort it. I know its gonna be difficult when I take my last pills after tapering, when I know this is the end.

Thought I'd just update to keep myself accountable. I was scared to try Gabapentin again but I gave in due to the RLS last night and wow, it really helped. I got a full night of sleep and thankfully didn't wake up ill like I did last time I tried the Gaba - I guess that really was an unfortunate coincidence and not a reaction to it. This is a massive turning point for me, with the RLS being the biggest thing that causes me to relapse in acute withdrawals, every time. The Gabapentin seems to holding it off very well and I generally feel pretty good, considering how my previous Day 3's have been! I even listened to music and danced around a little to it, then felt emotional, lol 

I might actually make it this time! How long should I use the Gabapentin for - I was thinking maybe 1 week? No way in hell do I want to get dependant on it and have to withdraw from that too, so minimal use only. I've heard it can be abused but I'm not feeling any recreational effects from it myself so I have no reason to push it. 

Of course, the addict part of me is also thinking about how my stash of this stuff will be perfect for future withdrawals and so its not so bad if I use again for a little while. That side is pretty loud right now but I honestly feel no compulsion to go out pharmacy hopping right now, whereas yesterday I was really fighting with myself not to do it. 

My advice to anyone suffering is to try and get some of this stuff if you can. I'm lucky to have it only because it was prescribed to my old dog (she passed a couple years ago but we kept all her medicines for some reason that I'm thankful for). That probably sounds fucked up but its literally the same stuff as prescribed to humans. In the past she had valium too, but I used all that during past withdrawals :/ I can't believe the difference right now compared to what I've gone through in the past.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5446909}"

Kinda felt it necessary to convey how I'm feeling.

Little bit of back story to my issues. I'm 3.5 years clean as of January 4th. I didn't celebrate. I didn't even realize it until today. I live with my parents, I'm in a long-term outpatient rehab program, on 1 MG of suboxone a day. Tiny baby dose. Prescribed 2, only take 2 when I'm feeling cravings, and then yesterday happened.

Got screamed at by my dad for a Facebook status I posted about him. I'm not saying he was wrong to be furious, nor did I try to defend myself while he screamed at me. I grey-rocked to the best of my ability and didn't cry until my boyfriend called. When I hung up with him, I paced my room and was dizzy and threw up foam from crying so much, and I literally reached for my bottle of subs and then stopped myself. I really almost snorted a sub just to snort something, just to take things back into my own hands. Didn't, but it scares me that I got that close. I have counseling and group on the 11th and I think I'll be okay until then, but I really wanted some support and wanted to talk about it.

I have surgery on the 28th, and they told me to come off my subs 2-3 days before so they can give me vics, and I really want to snort them.

I'm once again at Day 2 trying to cold turkey DHC. Not really by choice, just lack of funds and the recent lockdown restrictions making it harder to justify my pharmacy hopping since I have to use public transport. Getting paid early before xmas just meant I blew through my money on opiates even quicker before Jan 1st even hit so this has to happen at some point this month. Still, I'm tempted to go out. I even walked down to my local pharmacy to get some co-codamol and Lope to help me with the WD's a bit and the fucking place is closed until next week due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". Walking down there in WD's in the freezing cold only to see that sign was devastating, lol So I don't have any 'comfort' meds of any kind. I've got a bunch of Gabapentin, albeit its expired by a few years but last time I tried that, the next day I woke up extremely unwell with the worst migraine of my life which had me close to puking every time I moved my eyes or head. I don't know if it was a coincidence or related to the Gabapentin and I'm scared to try it again, I genuinely was scared I was dying, lol. Has anyone ever had that reaction to Gabapentin? Could it have been the fact its expired (I assumed that might just make it slightly less potent)?

So now I'm just wrapped in a blanket, with RLS gripping my right arm as it does every single time I withdraw, sipping on some leftover mulled wine from xmas because its all I have. Feels pathetic, boyos, especially at midday. I don't even react too good to alcohol. I've got a grocery delivery due otherwise I'd probably have said fuck it and taken a bus to another pharmacy by now. Last night I made the mistake of Benadryl before bed, even knowing how it messed me up in WD before I thought I'd try it again and woke up in the night with my arm going absolutely crazy. I fucking hate the RLS, I could deal with literally every other symptom of WD but the RLS makes me want to scream its by far the worst.

Thanks for the opportunity to vent. Hope everyone else is doing ok and managing to drag themselves through this experience too.

For me, HONESTY is the key!!! The unabashed, ugly truth is what’s going to keep me sober today! Honesty with my spouse especially, in regards to my mental state, my desire to use and really everything. But also honesty with my friends, family, my employer, etc... as a wise addict once told me “secrets keep you sick”. Secrets are what allowed me to relapse last time. They’re also what allowed me to continue using for 3-4 weeks because I thought I could handle my shit on my own.

I just want to make my withdrawal a bit more bearable and comfortable.

Today is my first day tapering, I am going down to 6 mg three times a day. Has anyone gone through this and could tell me if I am going to feel a difference in the dosage. They gave me 1 mg of Klonopin once a day to help with any discomfort I also take other medication including, gabapentin 800mg 3x a day, Dalmane 30mg at bed time, clonidine .3mg 3x a day I break one in half And take it two times throughout the day and then I take .6 mg at bedtime, I also take meta-Toprol 25 mg twice a day And Vyvanse 40mg about 2-3x a week it doesn’t work when I take it daily. I also have a rectal prolapse that cannot be fixed I got this for opioid induced constipation, so I also take linzess once every other day. 

When I am on the Klonopin, I have no problems with blood pressure I have no problem sleeping and I have no anxiety I realize that I could get addicted to this as I have gotten addicted to every drug that I have tried so far which has been almost everything you can think of but if I could just take Klonopin say 3x a day and get off the other medications for my blood pressure and just use Klonopin Dalmane and gabapentin for my rls and the linzess that is the goal to stop the subs the metatoprol and the clonidine. I’m only 22 I shouldn’t be on so many meds but I have fucked up my brain so much that I feel it’s a necessity to take these medications.

I just can’t see myself without the suboxone I’m terrified even though we are going to taper extremely slowly I just I am so worried that I’ll go back to streets once I’m off the meds. I have a good support group and I’d love some more support and opinions from you guys who have been through it. Some people just don’t understand. But it’s like I’m losing the love of my life and I hate that I love opiates it’s such a sinister feeling but I’m feeling much stronger than I did a year ago. I tried committing suicide from an overdose I took 80mg OxyContin,120 XR Xanax , and drank half a fifth of sailor Jerry’s I was blacked out for 5 days and I woke up in detox. Then from there I got on Suboxone and Now I’m a year clean from opiates and alcohol, and I’m not suicidal and I take my meds as prescribed but it just feels dirty being on Suboxone like I’m still physically addicted to opiates and it makes me extremely depressed.

I am a 21 year old who started taking oxy in summer of 2019. 40MG every day during the summer when I didn’t have school. I started taking it everyday later on into the summer. Once college began, I quit and did it very little. Then this summer I did it everyday again and my tolerance increased during the summer.  Half way through i began to take 80mg per day and once again quit once school started.  Now over December break I did it again every day 40-MG-80MG mainly and rarely 120MG.

In terms of cognitive abilities such as memory, information processing, dopamine, motivation, happiness, everything. When will I finally become the old me and these cravings will die out?  I just want to be who I was before this drug and succeed in my life. I wanna stop asap because I know where I can end up. I have kratom and will take it if I need.

In the 7 years of being together we’ve been thru a lot as any expected addicted couples are. One OD while I was pregnant with our first child and he got clean and has stayed clean since besides being on Suboxone. For myself I’m not doing anything just bud at night. But anyways back to the present, we’ve had a really really rough year as have most of us in 2020. Lots of fights, lots off backslides... I left for two weeks with the kids during summer when we started getting volatile with one another. Came home everything’s been great for the most part until beginning of Dec, unfortunately lost his job due to conflict at work and it’s been a lot to handle as he was the only breadwinner. But it’s ok we’ve been thru worst we will get thru this. Well he’s been trying to get as clean as possible for an upcoming drug test. No weed(WAS a avid daily smoker) , no Suboxone on most days, just total withdrawals all month of Dec. a lot of it has been taken out on me and I’ve sucked it up because I know how hard it is to get off shit unexpectedly and i know he’s really trying to provide for his family. Then tonight happened. Got drunk, got in argument with me, went to store for more beer, got home and had an argument with neighbor then we got into it some more. Hurtful shit was thrown out to one another and then I said the worst thing I could think of just to stab him in the gut and to make him feel worthless as he had been calling me all night. “ I just wish one of these times you fucking OD and die like you always threaten.” I instantly regretted it. He was furious at first and then just started bawling like I’ve never heard him cry before. I knew I fucked up and BAD. I’m always the one subconsciously telling myself not to say things I can’t take back especially in anger and I did it to not only the father of my children but the man I do truly love.

I can't make excuses anymore. Reading the stories of other people's struggle has put my own into sharp relief. For so long I blamed a lot of my problems on my severe depression - laying in bed for most of a day, barely holding interest in activities I used to enjoy, even things like the sweats, the insomnia, the diarrhea , I put down to side effects of my antidepressant meds, not early signs of withdrawal.

&#x200B;

I managed 7 days back in October before relapsing. In those 7 days I did \*so much\*. I did art again. While I was physically uncomfortable for some of it, I feel I got off very, very easy compared to most. My desire to do things quickly returned. But the spirals of hopelessness, anxiety, the pressure that would build up would also rip these huge, crying, sobbing freakouts out of me, the likes of which I haven't had since I was unmedicated and undiagnosed for my clinical depression. I felt like opiates was the \*treatment\* rather than another poison.

I've had to have very scaled back usage the last week or so. I'm not clean, exactly, but my usage is currently about a sixth of what it would be on a ""normal"" week. It's not been great - I can't sleep more than about 5 hours a night and I get random hot flashes and sweats at night. Sometimes my anxiety suddenly builds up and blindsides me. But its... manageable. And knowing that it's the withdrawals, rather than my mental illness, knowing that it will almost certainly fade with time...

But it probably will. And I don't have the willpower to throw them away once I get them. It's not a large supply, but it still scares me, because it's so easy to get lured back. I need to quit. I have to. I have said for years I've wanted my life back from illness, thinking it was my depression. But the illness that's destroying me now is the addiction. I need to quit.

First off I just wanted to thank those of you who post in this forum. This is a really great and really helpful place for people who are lost and scared like myself. It is comforting to know I am not alone in my struggle. Basically I have been an addict for a little over 2 years now. Started long before taking 30's every once in a while with some friends . Eventually got worse and worse to where I was taking 150-180 mg a day. I was spending so much money on these that I put myself very close to losing my home and my car, not to mention putting my job at risk countless times. I eventually OD'd two years ago thanksgiving night. Woke up to paramedics around me laying on the floor of my friend's parents house. That didn't stop me though and I continued to use for 6 months after that. I tried intensive outpatient rehab and it kept e clean for a month or so but I bought pills on the day I ""graduated and started using everyday again. I drove my long--term girlfriend away. She gave me so many chances and just couldn't understand why I kept choosing to use everyday. Finally she had to move out and leave me.

By the grace of God I decided to try M.A.T (mediation assisted treatment) and got a script for suboxone. Suboxone was a miracle for me. I immediately was able to stop using. I was on suboxone for 1 year and two months. Tapered off no problem at the end and thought I was finally ready to take this disease on on my own. After 6 months of being on suboxone my girlfriend moved back in with me and gave me a second chance. It was the best I ever felt in a long time. There was one major problem however, even though I was taking suboxone, I did not find a strong support system to put around me. I did not want to try therapy, I did not want to go to meetings, and I did not want to surround myself with sober people. I didn't even stop smoking weed or drinking. Boy was I dumb.

Two months after I stopped taking suboxone I relapsed. Lasted about a week. My girlfriend was devastated, but she was motivated to help me. She knows how hard I worked to get to this point and she helped me find therapists and was a really great support for me. She was someone I could talk to and be open with, and while she had a tough time understanding addiction. She really tried so hard. Unfortunately I never ended up seeing a therapist and I did not try meetings. I was able to stop and made it another two months.

This is where I am now. I relapsed again about a week before Christmas. Destroyed my girlfriend once again. She needed space from me and moved out into a hotel with one of her friends (she is a nurse and because of COVID the hospital is offering to pay for the cost of a hotel to keep employee's families safe). She is there now and I cannot stop using. I finally attended my first meeting (virtual) and have an appointment with a therapist on Thursday. I am going to attend a meeting everyday for 90 days, and I am going to take therapy really seriously. I need to build a strong support system around me which leads to my questions.

Those of you with serious clean time, how did you do it? What kind of support do you have around you and which works best for you? I love the idea of meetings but I am worried because Narcotics Anonymous centers around a ""higher power"" and after everything I have been through and everything I have put the people I love through, I have a hard time believing in that. If meetings are your thing, how did you find your higher power? What coping mechanisms work for you when you are feeling cravings?

For example, I was once 13 days clean off fentanyl, took the pill the day before I was scheduled to get the shot, and ten minutes later I was laying on the floor throwing up and having the worst panic attack of my life. This went on for 20 straight days (so 33 days total if you count the 13 I was clean and detoxing before taking the pill). After the pill I literally couldn’t hold down a sip of water for, no exaggeration, 20 days. I ended up in urgent care on an IV because of how dehydrated I was. My doctor said that even if the pill had caused precipitated withdrawal it would have been over in 24 hours. Nope. 20 days. And the hell only stopped because I started using again simply because I couldn’t take another second of how sick I was. I’m terrified to try Vivitrol again but I had 9 months clean because of it at one point (another attempt before the 20 days story) so I think I should give it another shot. I’m on day one of detox as I type this. 

Sorry for rambling, I’m curious how sick Vivitrol has gotten you. How long you were clean before trying it. If you went straight for the shot or had the pills first. I recently heard that like 15% of people react negatively to the pill version even with enough clean time. But it terrifies me to just go straight to the shot and kick off a month of being in the worst hell you could ever imagine.

I am on day 2 of a 25 day taper to get down to 1 (pressed fent) pill a day.  I have a locked timer safe where I pull out the days allotment and then lock the rest up with a timer for 24 hours.  This safe cannot be broken into so it is working and should help do the job.

I am now researching like crazy for how to deal with the WD on Day 26 at the end of the month.  I have read SO many posts ranging from large doses of Vitamin C, to Kratom, to Suboxone, to people saying just go CT.  And with EVERY post, there is a debate on almost all of the recommendations. haha. One person says it saved their life (Kratom for example) while others say you are NUTS to be doing that.  

SO..would people please help me understand what the ""staples"" are of comforting yourself during the first week of WD?  For reference, I have been snorting 12 pressed pills a day for 5 weeks and fully expect a WD.  Tapering down to 1 pill a day should ""help"" but I am trying to plan to the best of my ability for Days 26-33.  

I have never had a WD before.  I got clean at 22 and relapsed at 35 this year due to stresses of COVID and being alone in a new city/state without support.  Not making excuses, I own this and want to do better!  I started using in August and after 1 month I stopped and then had WD for 4 days CT before relapsing immediately to avoid being sick.  In the 4 days, I had no stomach issues or vomiting..BUT I had muscle aches, hot/cold flashes, RLS, no sleep, and anxiety.  Are there any medications I should stock up on now that can help?  

I have an amazon cart of vitamins, melatonin, Advil, but what else should I get?

Also, and I know this is very debatable but I would like to get Kratom for the first week in case the anxiety is too much to bare.  I know this is a bit risky and would only take for 7 days at most as I heard the WD on that is pretty bad too...BUT, I am struggling to see which strain to order for WD so any suggestions there would be great too.

2021-01-03 15:32:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/kpsdoq/started_tapering_today/,Started tapering today,"Hi group. 

I am pretty sure I am on the lightweight end of addiction but I have had enough of this. I want to come clean.

So for about 13 years I have recreationally taking codeine painkillers. 30mg/500, and for the last two years dihydrocodeine 30mg. I have also taken some OTC painkillers in larger doses, usually 4 at a time, 2000mg of paracetamol and 48mg of codeine. At my worst I was taking 3000mg of paracetamol/72mg codeine, up to 3 times a day (this caused me some serious stomach pains so I didn't keep that up for long).

I have bought them, been refused them from shops. Lied to my wife, family and friends, and stolen them too (though not from anybody who used them/needed them). It all started when I was a teenager, I was given them by family for a headache. I learned very quickly how they made me feel so I used them to relax. It stayed like this for a long time, I was only taking 60mg/1000mg paracetamol at a time and only a few times a day, if not per week. I didn't think too much about it, all through university. I figured I didn't drink much, and I didn't do any other 'real' drugs or smoke so what is the harm right? 

But since I was made redundant 5 years ago I have had some serious depression and anxiety building up. Now don't get me wrong, I was lucky and got a job in another field after 6 months but since that time I have had some serious self esteem issues and haven't been able to get back on my feet. I have still got the job but absolutely hate it and it has really run me down. I have gotten to the point last year where I was taking pills every day like clockwork, morning, lunch, evening and night and my doses were 2 strong ones at a time or 4 otc ones at a time. 

I have since had bowel issues, lost interest in sex almost completely and even porn barely interests me. My wife feels unwanted, but I tell her it is just my anxieties ruining my interest. Just before Christmas I started taking 4 strong painkillers at a time and barely paid attention to spacing them out throughout the day (every 4 hours? 3.5 is close enough, 3.5 didn't hurt, 3 is as close as 4 and so on).

I started seeing a therapist last year, she told me that I have serious perfectionism and anxiety and depression. I feel so lost in life and I have been in this fight or flight mode for years and that no wonder I have lost interest in much of life, I am constantly searching for a solution to a problem but nothing has worked. She doesn't know about my addiction as I do not want to be put on any official lists, I don't want anybody to know about my problem. But what she said makes sense. When I take the pills I feel calm, even hopeful for a little while. I feel in control too, it is to the point where if I have no codeine, I will take 2-4 paracetamol to at least feel 'something'. 

The funny thing is I work with doctors, I know the health consequences, I do not want to suffer, but stopping so far has been difficult to say the least. It is so hard to quit. If I go cold turkey I get restless legs at night and can't sleep. I have mood swings and get angry so fast and feel so sad. My therapist actually asked me if I had been considering suicide (January last year I was interrupted before I attempted it, but it was a close call). I am not suicidal now but I feel so hopeless all the time. 

It feels good to get this off my chest. I wanted to quit this year, but 3 days in and I crumble ( I had my last pill a week ago though). But I have decided maybe to taper instead. So that is my plan, starting today. Lower the bar and wean off. 

I feel a bit more hopeful now. Maybe I can ignore my other troubles and focus on this one. It has only just occurred to me that maybe this addiction has affected more of my mentality than I am aware and perhaps some of my other life problems have been caused, or at least made worse by it.

I didn’t have too much difficulty until I hit the 3.5 and then 3 tabs daily. I read that once you are down to 3, it becomes more difficult. For me, that has proven true. Achy knees, upset bowels and holy hell, the anxiety has been awful! I came down to 3 a week ago and after about 4 days, the symptoms started to ease some, physically. The anxiety comes and goes, but man....it’s an ass whoopin when it hits! If it weren’t for my daily use of edibles right now, I don’t know if I would be successful at this. I doubt it.

If you're reading this you're probably tired, scared, and tired of being tired. Here are some things that would help determine if you're a good fit for Medication Assisted Treatment, and which medication would be right for you based on your needs and background. We will go over the two most popular medications for opiate use disorder and get an idea of which one is for you.

M.A.T. stands for Medication Assisted Treatment

If you are feeling bad, sick, etc when you are not using; you might want to consider M.A.T.

M.A.T. has its positives and negatives.

Both of the medications we are going to talk about are in fact opiates.

**Methadone** is a full opioid agonist. It binds fully to mu-opioid receptors allowing it's effects to be felt fully, and increase as the dose increases. **Buprenorphine** is a partial mu-opioid agonist, so while it binds fully to receptors, it does not produce the same intensity of effect as **methadone** and other full agonists. What this means is basically that you will ""feel"" methadone more than you will ""feel"" buprenorphine.

The potency of Methadone is about  7 to 10 times more potent than morphine.  It is a full agonist. When you use methadone for addiction treatment, you can only get it from certified opioid treatment programs. These include methadone maintenance clinics.  Once the clinic doctor decides you’re stable with methadone treatment, they may allow you to take the drug at home between visits to the clinic. If you take the medication at home, you still need to get it from a certified opioid treatment program.

The potency of buprenorphine is about 40 to 70 times that of morphine.  For Suboxone, you don’t need to go to a clinic to receive treatment. Your doctor will give you a prescription.

The positives are you won't have to go cold turkey and feel terrible, you can slowly taper off and regain control of your life. You won't have to be in sketchy situations to buy drugs, you can just show up daily to a clinic or get a prescription from a special doctor to take a tablet or dissolve a film under your tongue to feel better. Even if you are paying out of pocket for treatment medication, it will be a fraction of what you were spending a day on drugs. You can receive treatment for other medical problems you may have because you're stable (HIV, HEP-C).

The negatives are if you don't have insurance you will have to pay for either out of pocket. The upside is that out of pocket cost is so much lower than what you were probably spending a day on drugs.

If you haven't been using for a year - You may be a better fit for buprenorphine

If you HAVE been using for more than a year you may be a better fit for Methadone.

If you don't feel like you can be somewhere EVERY morning for a while, you may be a better fit for Suboxone.

If you feel like you CAN be somewhere every morning and have been using for over a year you may be a better fit for Methadone. The Clinic provides alot more structure, counseling, etc with methadone treatment. You will regularly see a doctor, counselor, and a therapist.

Either one of these medications are a really, really good step. You won't be sick all the time. You won't have to be in sketchy situations to get drugs anymore. You won't be a disappointment to your family and friends. You won't have to quit cold turkey and deal with feeling like your body is shutting down. You will get your life back.

I have some questions for you.,"Been hook on fentanyl for years off and on. At one point I had over 9 months clean whole on Vivitrol, so my goal is to get back on it. Only thing standing in the way is the two week period of literally hell on earth that comes with fentanyl withdrawal. My doctor gave me 24 1mg ativans, 30 100mg seroquil, 30 0.1mg clonidines and some nausea medicine that I can’t recall the name of. I’m hoping to just sleep through this next week but I doubt by day 3-4 these scripts will even take the edge of. I have some questions for all of you that I’m hoping to get the answers to before I’m in too much pain to even pick my phone up and make sense of the words on my screen: 

1) can I get fired for trying to use the family medical leave act (FMLA) for opiate detox? I’m doing the detox process at home under the supervision of a doctor (a couple appointments throughout the week before taking the Vivitrol shot on Saturday). 
2) I was not expecting having to go detox starting today/tomorrow so I won’t be able to give my job barely any notice at all which adds to my already severe anxiety about the whole thing. I’m on year 9 of a pretty strong career and having to start all over because of something like this would be devastating. Any advice on going through the FMLA process? Located in Boston if that makes a difference. 
3) with what kind of frequency should I take those 3 prescriptions I listed about plus copious amounts of weed edibles and Imodium and Pedro that I have? I realize I can’t just keep myself asleep for a week straight but I’m trying to minimize the symptoms that devastate me the most: insomnia, absolute earth shattering anxiety, insane stomach issues and pains (I have irritable bowl syndrome which slows down with opiates but once I’m off the fentanyl it all comes flooding back, pun intended), puking, restless legs, zero energy (like to the point of barely being able to stand up and shower or finish wiping my ass after shitting, sorry for being so blunt), did I mention anxiety? 
4) any movie/tv show recommendations to keep my mind occupied my?
5) my doctor says I’ll be ready for the shot in 7 days but I’ve gone 14 days clean before and got the shot and was sicker than I have ever been in my life afterwards for 20+ days. Ended up in urgent care on an IV for liquids because I couldn’t keep even a sip of water down for almost 3 weeks after already being clean for 2 weeks before that. Every time I tell my doctor that he basically just brushes it aside and doesn’t believe me that the Vivitrol pill (which he gives me before the shot to ensure I don’t have a bad reaction) would’ve had me sick for that long. Long story short, has anyone heard anything like that story? Anyone been clean for two weeks and still get precipitated withdrawals? Anyone know how to avoid that?

Thanks in advance

I never wanna touch one of those things again... i just wanted to share my experience, and say that anyone who is reading this and struggling with quitting, keep up the good work. You can do it :) time to kick opiates a**. What a sh*tty way to start 2021 :/ but regardless, f**k opiates! I believe in all of you guys, good luck.",48,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5225099}"

I wanted to reach out and seek some guidance on here. My younger brother is addicted to opiates and has been homeless for the last year and a bit. I recently moved back to my home city (where he, my Dad, Mom, and older brother live) and the second night after I arrived we managed to find him and I gave him a piece of paper with our phone numbers on it so he could reach out if he wanted. Up until that point no one had spoken to him in a year. 

He then got in touch with my older brother on Christmas Day, and we were able to get him into a hotel room so he’s off the streets. He’s clearly deep in his addiction but we’ve been able to have a few lucid conversations with him about how we can help him and what kind of treatment he’d be willing to do. He told us that he hates living like this, and I’m hopeful that he reached out because he wants to change his life. He has extreme highs and lows and some days he seems much more willing to engage than others, which I’m sure is par for the course. We are checking in with him every day and obtained a naloxone kit in case of an emergency. 

I’ve asked if he’s using safe injection sites and been as clear as possible with him that I’m terrified for his well-being, and he seems to be receptive to my saying that I love him and will do anything I can to help. This morning he told me he loves me too. He has had moments of laughter and smiles and I can tell he’s still very much “in there”, and it’s been such a relief just to see him and hug him, despite the drugs and being in the streets taking an obvious toll.

Can anyone who has recovered from these drugs please help me understand what made you take the leap to recovery? I feel like my brother is closer than he’s ever been, and that so many positive things have happened, but I just want to help him see that another life is possible and he’s truly not alone in this. He’s probably been an addict off an on for the better part of ten years, so we are well aware that this is a long road ahead. 

Thank you all so much for reading. Sending love ❤️",22,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6306801}"

There will be multiple hard truths you'll just have to accept, not everyone will be happy that you're getting sober, you'll lose a lot of people most of them will be fake friends. However, a few will cheer you on and wish they could stop themselves but anyone who gives any negative reaction to your sobriety get that person out of your life. This is a viewer question will not disclose their name but, if you don't want to watch you'll miss a lot of key points but, you'll want to stay with a family member or sober friend, also get yourself into a program even if you don't want suboxone or methadone or vivitrol but counseling is really important the truth is most of us do drugs because we aren't happy with either who we are in life or where are life has taken us, not to mention we don't naturally create dopamine, so don't be afraid to use a crutch at first don't let people tell you that's not being sober. If you can do it by yourself then, that's even better. However, sometimes its just not that simple, so keep your options open.

It wasn’t even worth it. Last night I did a little at a time so I would t overdo it and I couldn’t find a vein, so I finally muscled it, which I have never done. I got more today and did most of it in one shot and I went through 5 needles trying to hit a vein. I finally got one and I felt the rush I was so looking for, but it was nothing like I remembered. It wasn’t the heavy rush and amazing feeling in my stomach. Now I have track marks all over my feet and arms. I waisted $80 (which I needed for my car registration renewal and oil change). I’ve just been so utterly depressed for months and wanted to feel nothing but bliss for a little bit. It just sucks so bad that after all these years I still have fucked up veins. So now that I’ve relapsed after 6 years I have to just let it go. 
Any advice on what to use to make my track marks clear up quick? I can’t remember what I used to do. 
Also, any words of advice on getting straight after a relapse?

My right heart valve is damaged and it’s constantly racing all the time. My resting heart rate is 105-115bpm. 2020 sucked for everybody, but I spent 3 months in the hospital. During that time I was under police supervision so I was in handcuffs the entire time. I’m not complaining because I much rather be in a prison hospital in Bellevue than on Rikers Island, so I was lucky in a sense. Now, I’m out of the hospital jail and I’m getting fat. But I’m trying. A few times I thought a lot about getting high but I didn’t. I mean, I really can’t now, I could literally die. 
It’s 2021 (12:55am) and I’m spending it with my 13 year old daughter, Olivia, and my mom. A lot better scenario than 5 years ago when I was all alone after scaring my girlfriend, her leaving to rush to Bkln and I’m home alone in Spanish Harlem to smoke crack and shoot speed balls. Jesus, I can’t believe that was once so appealing to me. 
Anyway. I have a lot of scars. A lot. I would post a picture but it’s only for text, this thread. But I still see a lot of doctors and they know what time it is when they see all the scaring. But for normal people, on the subway, when they see it they don’t automatically know they’re track marks. I was hoping to be able to blame the scars on some kind of disease. And I’m not promoting lying my whole life, but it would be nice to have an easy out when I encounter normal people who are curious. Anyone have this problem? What do you say? Again, this isn’t about lying to a potential girlfriend or employer, it’s just for every day people that I don’t want to get too personal with. 
Any suggestions would be appreciated and I am grateful. 
Also, I’m learning piano! 
I hope 2021 is a lot better than 2020. I mean, Jesus Christ. 
Thanks.
