Been stalking this site on and off for about a year - promised myself if i made it far enough that i could write (lol) i would do it for any others, as reading posts helped me so much before and during jumping. Quick background: i have been an opiate/ opiod user for 23 years and came off 6mg bupernorphine 20th may this year/ 3 years, then also quit anti anxiety medication in October. Was wobbling all over the place so I then got myself into a quagmire with Kratom which obviously spiralled out of control quickly and i now have 23 days clean from that also. This is the most sober i have been since i was 17 (40 now) and at first i felt like prising opiates away from my receptors had literally broken my heart (which still hasnt stopped beating out my stomach) my brain has thrown everything it has won with for the last 23 years at me over the last 3 weeks to try and get  me to use - felt like literal armageddon. But im starting to feel little bits of sun now and again and i keep thinking to myself ""you have actually done it"" which seemed like an impossibility at times during my life. i went from fuck opiates to i miss my best friend and back again a million times, but what occured to me is that the longer i have left it the worse it has become to prise myself away - and over the years my ability to believe i could do it diminished to almost nothing. ive essentially tortured myself over and over trying to put off the invevitable and in the process have made it 10 times harder. struggling to see how im gonna get over all the years i wasted on this crap but what i do see is it cant go on any longer and what i built up in  my head was 10 times worse than it has actually been. What i wanted to say is that as someone who literally had no hope left whatsoever that it was possible to get clean, i can now say it is possible and anyone struggling dont give up trying: its not about how often you fall off the horse but how many times you get back up! i hope that this helps someone!",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6749923}"

Up until almost 5 months ago I was an everyday heroin user and also dabbled in meth for nearly two years. Ive had several bouts of years sobriety , before ultimately getting comfortable, getting miserable then I get high. 
5 months ago I finally found a way to get vivitrol for free and I jumped at the opportunity as fast as I could. I so wanted to be sober and tried so hard without any type of MAT but tianeptine is everywhere in the state i live and no matter how much I didnt want to buy it somehow my brain would end up convincing me that one more day wouldn't hurt anything (narrator: but it did hurt. Because one more day turned into months and mont)

Since I've been on vivitrol i haven't opiates. I mean aside from making sure vivitrol actually works on two occasions the first month. And it has been amazing. I have confidence in myself again.  Using thoughts are starting to away. My emotions are beginning to even out. Things are just so much better.

But still every like 3 to 8 i end up doing something stupid. And every time I get caught and ruin trust I just Gianed. Not to say I don't want to be caught i seriously just want to be clean. Im so tired of this life. I just want to move forward life has so much beauty and this drug use is killing me and holding me back.

Monday night I bought 1.5 grams of meth and shot all of it within 12 hours. I went crazy. I manically sat in front of the mirror and picked at my face for over 24 hours. Im in so much pain right now. I look like someone repeatedly hit me in the face with a baseball bat. Im so crushed right now I don't know what to do. Why why did I do this to myself. I knew what that mrth was going to do to me. But I convinced myself that since I know it turns me into a manic picker somehow this time would be different.

I feel like I'm gunna have a break down. I cant handle this. I cant handle fucking up this bad every other month. Why can't I just stay clean for good? What is wrong with me? 

When I picked up the meth I had a plan to do it all then just kill myself so this would never happen again. Here I am still alive and doomed to ruin my life another day.

Edit: I guess I should mention im an opiate addict and I relapsed on heroin several weeks ago. Im on vivitrol but I can still feel it after a week. This is bullshit.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.516917}"

Now ok, I am lucky because I had the money to buy these expensive pills. But it was worth it. I spent about 3 weeks tapering the oyx down to around .5 mg every 3 hours.

So was it easier than cold turkey? Yeah, but the prolonged period also produced unexpected problems. I lost 25 pounds and I am sorta skinny to start with. The lack of energy was a bitch.

Something has come up, and I needed to just do it. I jumped off at 1.25mg-1.5mgs. 

Yesterday I was hopeful & achy.

Today I'm super achy, but still hopeful. 

I'm guessing tomorrow it will just get worse, but I keep telling myself I have no other choice.

I can't get Xanax, or clonodine, or Gabapentin, or anything like that.

When I put down the drugs, I had been a highly functional addict for over a decade. I got my masters, and became a licensed therapist even, though I didn‚Äôt work in my field much while using. I needed the higher paying job to support my habit.

I used fentanyl patches every day, hundred of dollars of cocaine per week off and on for years. Benzos/muscle relaxers to sleep, additional opiates to help with the pain of withdrawals, the pain of life. All at the same time. 

Most of that decade of life I really don‚Äôt remember. A few overdoses, lots of bad decisions. Two trips to jail. 3 wrecked cars. But then I found out I was pregnant. 

I don‚Äôt know why it jarred me so much, especially considered the things that DIDNT bother me when I was fucked up, but it did. I stopped everything cold turkey, the minute I saw the positive test, which put me in the hospital. Fortunately I was so early in the pregnancy that the fetus wasn‚Äôt effected. 

It was so hard. I mean the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. This right now, still the hardest thing I‚Äôve done/am doing. I love my son so much, he‚Äôs perfect, and I‚Äôm honestly genuinely very happy with my life as a stay at home mom. My boyfriend is now a year sober as well.

But man. When do the dreams stop? I‚Äôm on medication for nightmares and that helps a little but I have multiple dreams weekly of drugs, that wake me up. I have cravings every. single. day. And I still have no healthy coping skills developed. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed, and pissed at myself really. It‚Äôs just so difficult. I have my own therapist, and we talk about it, but the progress is slow. Can‚Äôt wait for things to get a little easier.

Got high once (of course regretted it, made me sick), and I microdosed .125 bupe for two days in a row around Christmas to stop the sneezing and lethargy. Probably should have just pushed through it, but... it did help, honestly. I took just enough to stop sneezing and get through that magical, awful holiday they call Christmas, heh. Feeling back to ""normal"" now. Still sneezing, still some lethargy, but I'm so committed to using this opportunity to ""reboot"".

The other fly in the ointment is that I just recently stopped taking Xanax for sleep. I let that go on too long. I've been taking .5-1mg every night for sleep. I know the next few nights are gunna be rough. I'm really praying that my body will just adjust to a new sleep schedule using melatonin. Luckily benzos have never been my vice. I use them exclusively for sleep. I am exercising like crazy (super sore right now) so hopefully that helps... We shall see.

I'm pretty close to flushing the rest of my bupe. Feeling pretty comfortable doing so, but maybe someone can tell me that's a bad idea.

2020-12-29 08:19:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/kmea15/the_value_of_a_pet/,The Value of a Pet,"Hello everyone... Just thought I would share a quick bit of my life, and maybe it will help someone else. Scroll to the bottom if you just want the cat tax. Haha!

First... to qualify myself.... I have been addicted to opiates since I was 15. I am 33 now. I have thankfulliy found my way into an MAT program that has absolutely saved my life. I went from homeless with nothing... To a fantastic job, my own apartment, and everything I need and most of what I want in a very short period of time. All because I decided to start taking my treatment seriously.

MAT saved my life. Of this, I have zero doubt. I want for nothing now. I am completely independent for the first time in my adult life. Even though I am single, I have never been happier. I'm sure that eventually I will find that last missing piece, but for now... I am content. 

Now, with all of that said... The reason for my post today is simple. I just wanted to let you all know that there is an immense value in a pet. Once I got settled into my new apartment, I was very lonely. I have been single for over a year now. I ruined the romantic aspect of my previous relationship, and althoughg we are still best friends, there is no hope of rekindling our love that we once had. I broke her with my addiction. 

So... I was lonely. Very lonely. I had no one to share my new life with. So I made the decision to get a friend. A kitten. I have always had dogs... When i lived with my parents, it was easy because there was plenty of room for them to run in the yard and they had access to hundreds of miles of mountains to play and romp in. I had never had a cat because my parents aren't really ""cat people"". So that, in turn, made me not a ""cat person"".

I had my first cat with my ex, and it was a great experience. The cat was born on May the 4th... So naturally, we named her Leia. Fantastic cat, and it really gave me the confidence to have my own now. Side note, she has since gotten Leia a friend, named Luke.

So on to now... I went to my local shelter with a specific kitten in mind. I had found her on the shelters website and she looked so cute! I had my mind made up that I wanted a girl. No good reason, just thought that girl cats would be more likely to take up with male owners. Seems to work that way, but maybe that's just in my head. 

However, I found out that she had siblings! She didn't really take to me when I held her... But her brother... Well, her brother was a different story all together. He was so excited to see and meet me! He chose me, for sure. 

His name? Well.. Keeping with the Star Wars tradition... His name is Poe! He is absolutely the best decision I've made in years. I love him to death and he is just the best. He is spoiled rotten and well behaved. Sleeps with me every single night. I know you are all dying to see him... [So here he is!](https://imgur.com/a/CB5wQMq)

So in closing... I really just want to let everyone know that the loneliness that comes from our new lives... When we get rid of the people, places, and things that we associate with our old lives... Well, that loneliness doesn't have to be so bad. If you are in a position where it is feasible... And you are responsible enough to properly take care of it, and that means being able to afford vet bills! Then, I highly recommend a pet. He has brought so much joy into my life, and I think he is happy here as well. Sure beats the shelter!

Also, I really just wanted an excuse to share pics of my awesome cat. I hope you guys and gals love Poe the way that I do. I hope you all are well, and if there is anyone out there that needs someone to talk to, I'm here for any of you. Feel free to DM me if you need.

My brother died last year of an intentional opiate overdose. He was 3 months sober when he was picked up by a girl that he had an on/off again relationship since they were 17 (he would have been 40 this year). She had a bottle of vodka waiting for him but what he didn‚Äôt know was that she had crushed up a lethal dose of oxy in the bottle. He chose to ruin his sobriety by drinking, but was unaware of the oxycodone. He overdosed and she drove around the hospital for 30 minutes with his lifeless body in her car to ensure he was dead. It was a ‚Äúif I can‚Äôt have him, no one can‚Äù situation. He was able to be revived but the brain damage from lack of oxygen was too much. He died June 21, 2019. The piece of shit was never charged for his murder however, she was arrested last month for aggravated assault, child abuse, and preventing someone from emergency services and is currently still sitting in jail 40 some days later which is the best Christmas present I could ask for. 

As a heavy opiate addict for the last 6 years, his death was my wake up call. December 29, 2019 I decided I couldn‚Äôt live like that any longer. I quit cold turkey. It has been hell. I‚Äôm still experiencing PAWS but I would change a thing. I know that he has been my guardian angel, watching over me and would be so fucking proud of me. I made his death count. I did what he spent the majority of his life trying to do for the both of us. Today I am one year sober. 

Recovery IS possible. I suffer from chronic pain from two severe injuries I had in 2015 and 2016. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to live with pain medication but I proved myself wrong. I am walking proof that anyone can recover!

I noticed my attraction to opioids after a stay in the hospital being pumped full of dilaudid. And subsequently being prescribed oxycodone. 

Been clean for 10 days but last night I had a dream that truly threatens the essence of my sobriety.  I dreamt that I was shooting up a vial of dilaudid (which Ive never done at home only at the hospital) my dream literally consisted of what seemed like 10+ hrs of trying to 1, get the dilaudid,  2 set up a syringe which I've never done and then what took the longest was finding a private place to shoot seemed like everytime I got comfy someone popped up,  even my own mother made a guest experience and looked at me with such disappointment so I spent an hour or two convincing her that it was not what it looked like... Anyway,  after finally finding a private place, I found a vein, pulled up on the plunger gently like reddit always said to do and saw blood fill the vial,  then I slowly pressed the plunger, (wish I slammed it if I knew it was a dream I would've)  and was immediately sent into that same bliss I experienced in the hospital 
 
After that I'm unsure what happened probably nodded off, but man am I disappointed with myself,  in my dream I didn't even think about me being 10 days clean I just had a mission and got it done. I woke up with such intense cravings,  never had such an intense overwhelming feeling to take em.

Same story as always; started w legit rx‚Äôs for hydrocodone for a medical condition, then moved to illicit means for acquiring perc 10‚Äôs, then 30‚Äôs, then 30‚Äôs I would snort, then H was ‚Äúthe same thing but cheaper‚Äù...y‚Äôall know the drill. 

So 3/30 this spring was my clean date. Came clean to my wife and family, who I‚Äôd hid it so well from that they were all shocked. Did an IOP via Zoom at the beginning of the pandemic. Quick suboxone taper. Clean and off the subs by end of June. Learning meditation practices and Buddhism working through Refuge Recovery. All‚Äôs going great. 

It‚Äôs August now; I‚Äôm set to travel out of town for work for the first time since getting clean. These used to be big fun times for me. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve brought pills and/or H through airport security. (Personal use amounts are stupid easy to get by TSA.) Almost on autopilot, I called an old connect on my way to the airport and copped a 50 bag of H. Brought it through the airport and had myself a blast on my business trip. Blasted off to nod city both evenings on my trip; ate Chinese takeout and swam in the hotel pool. Made a great impression w my work folks and generally had a great time. Do all the H, go home, feel some generic guilt, but overall, no consequences for this indulgence.

Still feel guilty though. Hurricane hits the other side of my state. Maybe I‚Äôm driven by the guilt, but I end up heading over to work the relief effort after the hurricane. I don‚Äôt feel any better for my good deeds. I just give myself an inguinal hernia lifting generators and water cases in and out of my truck. End up with my own rx for lortabs before and after hernia repair surgery in early October.

Oral opes are nice. I forgot about them. But I‚Äôm good about it. Finish my surgical recovery, finish my rx, and I move on. Just another nice indulgence I suppose. As shitty as this hernia thing was, I‚Äôm honestly glad for it bc it brought me a couple rx‚Äôs. (Goddamn. Normal people don‚Äôt think like that...) Get to enjoy Judgement free fun times. I got to take opes in front of my family, but this time it‚Äôs all on the up and up. No lying necessary. This legitimately very painful surgery was totally worth it.

It‚Äôs early November; I hook up w an old friend I used to buy lortabs from. He gets a rx once a month at the beginning of the month and will come off a few for me. 10-15 tens once a month. No more. This is perfect. Fairly cheap and fairly harmless. Once a month it‚Äôs something I can look forward to. Indulgences. Let‚Äôs do this.

It‚Äôs the second week of November. I‚Äôve finished the 10 tens I bought from ol boy. On autopilot again I call my other dude. I pick up a 100 bag of H. A day into having this bag, I realize this is too much. I have no business doing this shit. My tolerance is gone. Tiny bumps and I‚Äôm nodding. I‚Äôm missing important shit at work. Why the fuck did I buy so much? I‚Äôm on this shit for five straight days. I‚Äôm hiding my pinpoint pupils from my wife and freaking the fuck out worries I‚Äôll get caught.  She told me over and over in the spring that she can‚Äôt take a relapse. I get back on the shit and she‚Äôs taking my daughter and leaving me. (And who would blame her?) I finally get the balls to flush the little bit that‚Äôs left of my 100 bag on that 5th day. More symbolic than meaningful. I did all but like two lines of it at this point. I even get to experience some mild wd‚Äôs after such a binge. Good. I deserve every miserable moment, right?

The withdrawals subside. But I‚Äôm not quite right. Turns out I have covid. So do my wife and daughter. What a clusterfuck. But this is good. Isolation will keep me from doing anything stupid. We all recover in 2 weeks or so. Except the lingering effects of covid have my inflammatory bowel disease (the original condition that brought me to this fucking drug) just going nuts. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm nauseated and having violent, bloody diarrhea 8-10 times a day. There‚Äôs only one thing I know to stop this, so I do it.

Again, call my guy and get 4 perc 30‚Äôs. This gets me through Xmas. I can eat and drink freely if I snort a half a pill before the meal. And as long as I don‚Äôt do any more than that, my wife can‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm on this shit again. Christmas is good. My stomach still hurts and I still shit blood, but it‚Äôs only 2-3 times a day; not 8-10. 

The 30‚Äôs are gone now, and the IBD flare is subsiding. I think way too much about calling my pill and H man. It would be so easy. But I‚Äôd be right back there again. I wouldn‚Äôt be the H junkie I was last year, but I‚Äôd be on the same road. So I don‚Äôt make that call for now. But my dude w the lortab rx will have his shit again first week of January. And I will definitely be picking that up. Something to look forward to, right? 

So here I am. Am I even really clean? I mean, it‚Äôs definitely an improvement. A year ago, I was getting dope sick if I didn‚Äôt do a line of H within 2 hours of waking up. So I‚Äôve certainly come a long way from there. But I‚Äôm still thinking about it and planning these ‚Äúindulgences‚Äù once a month at least. What am
I doing here. I know I‚Äôm tempting fate, but to what end. Am I really clean for 9 months with these ‚Äúindulgences‚Äù of mine? I know myself. I‚Äôll probably keep walking the line. I always have. I‚Äôm not physically dependent on anything right now and I‚Äôm oh so thankful for that. But I obviously haven‚Äôt separated myself mentally from the old lifestyle.

I really need some advise and support, as I am really struggling to find local support as I moved half way across the world and the scene here is quite underground... 

Long time no post as I have been clean for years and kept myself out of ""the scene"" intentionally as to not get cravings (opiate subreddits always give me cravings, they never stop, only fade...)

No longer. I had a very intense knee surgery in Feb 2020. I knew I would have to take opiate pain medication, but thought I could control myself since I was clean about 5 years prior (DOC was iv H / fent; but fent was less prevalent then so it was mostly H, this habit lasted through a majority of my 20's so about 10 odd years on and off IV dope...) 

Long story short the injury lead to a massive relapse. I lost all sense of control after a few bloody days... and once the 30 mg codeine stopped working, I doc shopped into a ton of valium, tramadol, DHC, and other low dose opiates... Once that stopped hitting the sweet spot I found the old H again and had a line on legitimate SE Asian raw for the last 6 months. Throw a bit of stims misuse in there to get to my two full time jobs as well, MA - the bad one, also raw gear, used weekly...) So, I have been back on a rampage, using non stop, full bore, until a week ago, when I made the decision to move and get clean; because itll be **easy this time**, it was only a intranasal habit not IV this time. HA - **what a joke**. 

This could be my worst habit of all since all the gear has been raw and I've got a poly addiction with pharms+dope+benzos+occasional stims (oral and intranasal, no IV thank fuck)...

So I've been on a hard taper since moving, and the holidays have made this exceptionally fun (I am very sarcastic sorry in advance ;) 

Tapered my way down to pretty gnarly acute WD at this stage... Nothing miraculous but I have gone from 10-15 lines a day to 3-6. But the pain is real. Once I fall below a certain threshold, I can not stop thinking about it. I have the rushing thoughts, panic attacks, the ""what have I dones"", thinking everyone I know hates me and thinks I'm a horrible person, extreme social anxiety, bad trip huge pupils WD, crawling out of my skin feeling, no ability to be OK with anything... all that good stuff that comes with a taper or a kick. 

Ok so now I want to jump off CT. I know its a bit premature but this is not my first rodeo, its my god damn 20th kick or something outrageous like that. I know a lot of the tricks with diet, supplements, etc. 

My current supplement regime is 

a) Nigella Sativa - 2 g over a day 

b) Magnesium - 1 -2 huge ass tablets per day

c) Vitamin C - fucking heaps 

d) VERY low dose benzos when its just all too much

and e) I have been weening with the monkey water but would like to jump off as I am just going from sick, to ok, sick, to ok, sick, to ok, and I hate this as I feel like I'm not making much legitimate progress as each ""ween use"" is a semi relapse on a full-agonist opiate (H). 

So I guess my question is this: Other than ramping up other herbal stuff, what else do you guys/ladies recommend for the CT kick?

I have a place to kick, I can pretend to be ""regular"" sick to get out of obligations til New Years (thats 3-4 days), and I most importantly have the desire to stop. 

Last night I tried to not use and had an intense panic attack. Also I always think K will help and end up all tripped out fiending my ass of, and have decided K is not helpful to me, nor is cannabis which I have in edible form. The result from one tiny bite off an edible and a few k bumps last night was me tripping a bit and thinking I was going to die. Not ideal and wont repeat this tonight lol... 

I know I need to exercise, distract, all that good stuff and I go on walks in the park, 3x a day, but otherwise feel super lethargic already until my ween dose then I feel better (obviously this is not sustainable and is essentially a relapse) 

The country I live/in this region of the country it is extremely hard to get any sub, legally or black market I've never come across it except maybe once and it was a long time ago, long gone now, cant find it now. 

As my benzo stash depletes its self (rapidly...), I am thinking now is the perfect time to jump off the dope. Why prolong the inevitable is what I have learned from the 20 other kicks I've done.  

So my questions would be:

a) Does this sound manageable or am I setting myself up for failure?

b) I am tapered to about 0.5 mg aplrozolam or 2.5-5 mg valium (from like months of 1.5 mg alp / 30 mg val respectively) , I will continue to use those at night through the opiate kick as I would not sleep a wink otherwise I reckon, will I be at risk for seizure from benzo wd? The panic attacks are shit but I can handle that, I just dont want to actually be at risk medically.. 

c) Would you yourself kick a 9 month habit in this manner? It was a short habit but damn if my body is not extremely dependant on opiates again..

d) Are there any improvements I can make - Please dont say get sub or methadone as I do not want to go this route

Thanks to anyone who read through this dribble. Any advise and any support is welcome, as I am doing this all pretty much on the low and dont have a huge network for support. BUT I do want to get clean and I am over this shit. The drive is there, I just need some support. Thanks all.

Love and Light

When you go through withdrawals, how do you handle the sleeping arrangement? I can't really sleep in bed the first week, I just toss and turn or I'm up and down. I keep her up, or she keeps me up because I can hardly sleep even with comfort meds.

This was never an issue before this year, because my usage wasn't high enough that I couldn't sleep THAT badly. Now however, I'm using 60mg  oxycodone consistently and I get sick. I shake, I sweat, it's an ordeal.

During the different times, being sick this year. I started sleeping on the couch and when I felt like the worst had passed I'd go to bed so people could wake up and use the living room without me sleeping on the couch. This didn't work well because it involved me getting up and moving around which makes my ability to sleep much worse. Plus the couch isn't very comfortable and I don't like sweating on it.

Then I got an air mattress and kept that in our bedroom and I'd use that when I got sick. That worked ok, not great, it's uncomfortable. But it worked better. Cats popped it, and I'm planning on taking my first serious crack at getting clean on my own with the new year (all prior attempts had been because of a lack of availability).

So just curious how others have handled this. I'm thinking of getting a cot or a fold out bed or maybe a cheap mattress or maybe just another air mattress. I plan on needing it for a couple weeks before I can sleep in the bed. I just want a solid solution because getting clean and sleeping is hard enough.

Last year, when I went to detox to withdrawal from Methadone, I unknowingly bought a ticket to places and things I thought were unreachable for me. On this journey, I‚Äôve found happiness. Not a fleeting sensation brought on by ‚Äúlove‚Äù or the acquisition of any object, but a sustainable wholeness within myself. I found that elusive self-confidence that for my entire life escaped me. The sacred, apathetic, and nihilistic based thinking has begun dissipating and is replaced with self-worth and care. Not only for myself but for others also.
There is something amazing about coming to the realization that I have something to offer the world, and to be fortunate enough to be of use. It‚Äôs been a wild ride. My mother died from alcoholism; about 5 months into sobriety. I called others and cried in meetings. I needed to be vulnerable. I used to think I was a special snowflake with an immeasurable pain that others couldn‚Äôt comprehend. The truth is I just never talked about the way I felt. As a result, I closed myself off from the world. Through recovery, I‚Äôve found a way to relate to everyone and my world opened up in a way I never thought possible.

There is a lot of work still to be done. I am often lazy, I still vape, and over eat. But as I've seen it's progress not perfection. I've lost 50lbs over this year from light exercise and not eating (as much) ice cream. I signed up for and passed 3 classes (71.8 in spanish but I'm proud of that C).

I‚Äôm currently on day 9 without any pain pills. Cravings are still there (in my mind I think). My body isn‚Äôt craving them as much as my mind.

Most the time it was a 10mg at 9 am and then a 5mg or sometimes a 10 mg at like 2. Just enough to make me not hurt and feel a little pleasure. So now in my brain I‚Äôm like WHY AM I DOING THIS TO MYSELF ? Nobody in my life even knew about it, I was good at hiding it I guess bc I was never really ‚Äúloaded loaded‚Äù if you understand what I‚Äôm saying. I was able to work and function just fine. I have my kids bday party today at a jump house and I‚Äôm just like damn man how much easier would it be to just have something to relax me a bit and calm my nerves and I‚Äôll be a better more level headed mom. This is just what I‚Äôm saying in my head, I know it‚Äôs not reality. I know I would eventually go to harder things if I didn‚Äôt stop. And I‚Äôve lost all my family to hard addiction, I beat myself up for even starting anything. Back story , after I had my girls I ended up in ICU for a month because I  got blood clots in my lungs, heart, small intestine and liver. Come to find out I have factor V Leiden , which is a hereditary blood clotting disorder. I served 11 years active duty military before my kids and never knew I had this nor had a single problem. Point of the story is, I was in sooo much pain from my lungs collapsing , etc I was on Iv pain meds and man I‚Äôve never felt so good. In the beginning I didn‚Äôt feel good bc I was in so much pain but towards the end of my hospital stay when I was a little better that‚Äôs when I learned the actual feeling of it and woman was it bliss. So that is how I ended up addicted to pain pills. This is my first attempt to stop and I have no intention on going back. I‚Äôve had the person I usually would get stuff from blowing my phone up and I just ignore it. So I feel like I could get them if I TRULY wanted to but I‚Äôm not bc I dont think I truly want them, my mind just wants them. I  know it‚Äôs early in my recovery. My question is: WILL MY BODY EVER GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS PRIOR TO MY ADDICTION ? Or will I always hurt and not have that natural happiness I use to have? This site has been my savior.

Probably around 100mg of codeine twice a day but supplemented with either Amitriptyline or pregabalin, sometimes Prozac if I can get any.

My addiction has been steady for years, at the moment I just have these small amounts but I‚Äôve been doing it daily for a while now. I started getting more into it when I took my dad‚Äôs supply of oxycodone after he‚Äôd died. I know my mum‚Äôs still got fentanyl patches and I think about that a lot, which probably isn‚Äôt a great sign. I also dream about stealing pills or buying pills or finding pills almost every night.

I suppose my question is: what do I do about it? Do I try and just wean myself off by taking fewer pills per day? I‚Äôve been thinking about if it would be safer for me to just start smoking weed. Would that help me get off opiates? One problem I can see is that my liver can‚Äôt be doing too well if I‚Äôm taking all this paracetamol and ibuprofen so it adds up enough codeine to get a nice high. My dad died of liver cancer at 64 and he never, ever drank alcohol. I don‚Äôt want to end up with liver cancer.

I'd like to know if there is a way in which I could slowly going through withdrawals without cutting off heroin in an instant.

This time last year I had gotten off Suboxone and convinced my doctors to put me back on Oxycodone. From there, I decided to get off the oxycodone in early February and returned to recovery.

I didn't take it seriously though and I started cheating. Then on July 29th in a moment of clarity -- I guess -- I confessed to my therapist that I had been using on and off Between February and July. I had no intention of quitting. As far as I was concerned I was just going to chip and use opiates ""for pain,"" and be fine.

*'cuz everything is fiiinnnnneeeeee.* (meanwhile everything is on fire).

Anyway, that didn't happen.

I started doing things differently. I decided to take each and every suggestion that was made to me with the best of intentions. Not every suggestion was right for me, but eventually, I found a system that worked for me.

I still haven't used since July 29th, 2020. I even had a hospitalization in the past 5 months for my pancreas and didn't use opiates whatsoever during that time. If you'd seen or know me from 2 years ago, you know that this is all a dramatic change for me.

I know today is Christmas, but tomorrow I get a huge gift. The gift of being five months sober and I just wanted to share my story a bit in hopes of uplifting someone else here.

To make a long story short, I‚Äôve been an IV opiate addict from the age of 18 (25 now).

Since then, I have been living back at home with my parents, and have been back to rehabs 2 more times. 

It seems that every time I‚Äôve gone away to rehab except the last time, it was because my parents found out I was using somehow and basically didn‚Äôt give me an option. 

My most recent relapse, I ended up telling on myself because I maxed out my credit card and needed gas in my car. My parents no longer pressure me to go to rehab, but they‚Äôre definitely not cool with me using. So they do everything they can to try to help me stay clean. 

My issue is that I‚Äôm still not convinced I‚Äôm doing this recovery thing for myself. I thought I was, but after this last relapse I find myself thinking things like ‚Äú I just need to stay clean until my parents are dead, then I can kill myself with dope.‚Äù

Reading all this just makes me feel like a overprivileged brat. I sincerely don‚Äôt want to be on opiates so I can continue traveling abroad but i can‚Äôt make it work. I‚Äôve been to detox two times in 90 days and every time Im there I bounce early because I can‚Äôt sleep there and I get psychotic when I don‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve kept heroin on hand at my house because I didn‚Äôt want to be in a situation without it if I didn‚Äôt get into public detox I would have nothing. So I set myself up to use again everytime I attempt detox and left early. This sublocade shot is supposed to be at my doctors office for this Monday but I‚Äôm supposed to not use heroin for seven days before I get it. They won‚Äôt give it to me if I test positive for morphine again. But I might have to use tomorrow. I really don‚Äôt want want to detox in Mexico but again I can‚Äôt be sick tomorrow. So tapering might be what I have to do with subutex which still isn‚Äôt touching my dope sickness. This whole situation is miserable and I realize I‚Äôve created it. Thanks for listening to my rant. Maybe just maybe I can make it out of this without having to cop. I literally leave on the 30th so trying cold turkey isn‚Äôt a really good option either.

2020-12-23 20:39:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/kj63qr/update_last_i_posted_was_going_to_detox/,Update: last I posted was going to detox,"Third day in (today) I left around 3pm. My reality was hitting me and I was overwhelmed by memories and feelings and regret and remorse and feelings of failure. I‚Äôm shocked how quickly a grab me again in shock that I was sick again in an institution again. My family celebrating the holidays without me again. I still had drugs that I had thrown out near my car. I had refused the subs because I wanted to get out as quickly as possible there was some thing I didn‚Äôt do either with with my unemployment that I have to do online before the 28th. So the withdraws hitting me hard on top of all these mental thoughts

because my plan sounded good while I was high but now I wasn‚Äôt high in my reality came crashing down on me in the same detox where I was at about two years ago where my gutter drunk roommate even found success. Asking myself as smart as I am why can I get it why am I so emotionally weak this time relapsing over a girl. But I guess the things they say are all for a reason about avoiding relationships for the first year. Remembering the months I had an a long term program and how much it cost me in the beginning but how far came and how good I was doing in the end but not following one simple suggestion brought me back within a month to square one. 

In the cafeteria I could barely eat and I was just judging and criticizing everyone there how they looked and how antisocial and disaffected/traumatized and anti social  they looked and were and comparing my experience to the other time I had been there which was the complete opposite I had friends in the vibes are good and again even a couple of those guys are still doing good but once again I find myself here skinny as a branch is not being able to eat. 

Then I just said fuck it and I acted impulsively with the irrational thoughts one nurse tried to talk me out of it and almost made me cry but my mind was already set I just wanted to get out of there I just wanted to not feel the way I was feeling I just didn‚Äôt see myself staying there much longer. Fast forward to now in my car in a parking lot trying to figure out where I‚Äôm gonna stay tonight my sister says that I should come home because I‚Äôm gonna worry my mom and put her in a panic mode tonight they‚Äôre celebrating her birthday. The last thing I wanna do is make her suffer anymore than I have already couple days ago she even cried saying if I die she will die so selfish and so messed up how would have caused this woman to go through.  And it might be enabling but she does not want to see me homeless so she always has a place where I can stay and I never really steal from her either. It‚Äôs just scary man how insidious this freaking disease is and how powerful this substances fentanyl. The nurse had this crazy theory to about how the Chinese are trying to become the world power and it‚Äôs payback from when Europe got the Chinese hooked on heroin in world war one or two. 

Lastly I‚Äôm not going to give up I want to overcome this going into this new year and make it a true long lasting overcoming I‚Äôm so sick of this vicious cycle and I will admit to replaying the girl who left me a couple weeks ago ‚Äòs words in my head was so painful but I need to also be emotionally stronger and love myself more. I do not want to die and I do not want to be an opiate addict I have so much potential I‚Äôm also not getting any younger the years have flown by I‚Äôve lost all my friends to this wicked disease. Ironically I ran into a guy when I was looking to cop that has a very similar story to mine and he was just saying how he wouldn‚Äôt wish this on his worst enemy and I need to give this garbage job he had a relapse after being clean for a few weeks I just got out of detox after a 12 year addiction looked healthy seems like he‚Äôs going to get back on it too the righteous path that is. His mind attacked him to just with that one time he was even on Suboxone and felt guilty as soon as he did it and then had to face his girlfriend right after who‚Äôs been clean for a year so sad.

Ready for a story? This‚Äôll be a long one! Lmao! 

Ok so I (39m) and my ex (26f) have this weird relationship thing going on right now and I was looking for opinions/suggestions/input. I know I probably won‚Äôt like most‚Äî if not all‚Äî of them. lmao. Ok so here it goes. But you‚Äôll need to know the back story. You‚Äôll need to know where we started and all the trials and tribulations that went into whatever it is we have‚Äî at least a shortened version of some of them at least. 

First tho, I should give a trigger warning as we‚Äôre both in recovery right now and there will be talk of past drug/alcohol use. I‚Äôm addict/alcoholic and she‚Äôs an addict. There‚Äôs also going to be talk of cutting, suicide, and eating disorders. And I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more triggers in here as well. Soooo back to story time. 

We met back in February of this year (2020) maybe around 5pm or so‚Äî idk w/e. We hit it off pretty great as friends and there was definitely a spark there. I met her over my buddy‚Äôs house, and gave her my number in case she wanted to talk more some day‚Äî literally 5 minutes after I left she was blowing me up. We talked all that day/night up until she got a call abt her aunt in the hospital dying around 4am. She of course immediately went to the hospital to meet with her mother and spend what little time she had left with her aunt. The next morning she borrowed her mother‚Äôs car and left the hospital to get fresh clothes for her and her mother and got pulled over. Now this is the part where I tell you she had a warrant and got arrested for a probation violation (OD‚Äôd) and was immediately jailed. Our story would‚Äôve ended there because at that point we had only known each other for about 12-15 hrs and she didn‚Äôt know my number by heart. We barely knew each other. 

But it didn‚Äôt end there. Oh no. Not at all. lol. That next day I was over some friends house. I, of course, was talking all abt this amazing woman I had met the day before and how I just felt something different‚Äî yet something just familiar. It was a feeling I haven‚Äôt felt before. And I have known love before. My fianc√©e and I had broken up abt 8months prior after being together for almost 14 yrs (story for another time), but w/ this woman it was just different. Idk. Anyway, I was just gassing her up to my friends and we hear a knock on the door. My friend goes to answer the door and it‚Äôs the police. Apparently she had a warrant out for her arrest. So my friend, of course, gets arrested. Now unbeknownst to me (or my friends) at the time the girl I had met the day before had been incarcerated. I figured she was just busy with the dying aunt. 

So my friend calls me later that night after processing to talk to her boyfriend and try to figure out arrangements to bail her out. And right before I pass the phone off to him my friend asks me the name of the girl I had been talking abt. Well, I‚Äôm sure you can guess the rest. As fate would have it, it was indeed the same girl. So my friend was able to give this girl my number and she called. And we talked. And we talked. And we talked and talked and talked. And we wrote letters to each other back and forth daily. And when I say wrote letters I mean that. Our letters would be a minimal of 10 pages front and back‚Äî my longest was around 23 pages front and back. (She loved them piss yellow legal pad pages I wrote to her lol). We got to know each other rather well, and after about a month she asked me if I would commit to her‚Äî if I would be her boyfriend. Well, it was a little more cute than that, but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. So there I was dating a con. A love story for the ages. lmao. Anyway, things continued pretty well. She ended up being locked up for about a month and a half and was released early due to coronavirus. She was out for 4-5 days before she checked into 30 day stay. And we spent just abt every waking hour together. She was sober, I sadly was not, and we were happy. She checked into inpatient and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs when the cracks started. Nothing major, but our communication was severely cut. Phone calls were more limited in rehab, but we still talked almost daily. Since she was only allowed one call per day she had to divide that between her mother and i, but we still wrote daily for the first couple weeks until her counselors started giving her shit abt not putting as much effort into the program that they would‚Äôve liked to have seen. They advised her to start journaling and writing me less‚Äî even though our letters were pretty therapeutic for her. Anyway, our communication decreased‚Äî instead of being on the phone for hours a day we went down to 5 minutes most days as that was the max clients were allowed to use the phone. Instead of murdering trees by the hundreds we wrote a few pages here and there. On a side note, I wondered for a time if her counselors had not limited our communication if things would‚Äôve been different?

Anyway, 30 days came and went. Her mom and I had formed a pretty decent relationship during that time. Her mother was pretty skeptical of me at the beginning‚Äî since, well, this girl hadn‚Äôt the best track record in her previous relationships‚Äî on top of the fact her mother thought the worst of me drug wise. Yea, I am an addict/alcoholic now in recovery‚Äîand so is she‚Äî but our DoCs were different. I‚Äôm not saying mine were worse or better either. An addict is an addict is an addict. So her mom naturally thought my DoC was the same as her daughters. She was relieved to find out it wasn‚Äôt and thats I think where the trust started forming. 

So 30 days later we were finally reunited again. And it was great. She had jail/rehab behind her and we were moving forward. We had plans and we were happy. And that lasted for about a solid 2 months. I could feel it. I rly could. I felt her slipping away and isolating. I starting noticing the deception and lies forming. I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. She was testing me. Prodding me into a corner to try and make arguments, and I tried my damndest not to fall for it. This culminated until we hit our boiling point. She started disappearing for hours/days. And we finally had our first argument. And then another. And then the truth finally came out. She was hanging out with an acquaintance of mine. A local dealer much closer to her age. She had ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù for him‚Äî lol not the drugs of course. And I tried to warn her that the path she was choosing would ultimately be her downfall. I pleaded with her that even if we couldn‚Äôt be together just please don‚Äôt do what she was with who she was. All that hard work and sober time would be lost. Her son she was trying so hard to get custody back of would suffer for it. I spelled out for her what literally ended up being the next two months of her life‚Äî and I was right. Everything happened just as I said it would, up to and including losing complete custody of her 18 month old son. We broke up, she relapsed (well, she technically did before we broke up), and things went south for her fast. I should also mention that when we broke up I told her not to contact me anymore. That I needed to clear my head/emotions if we were to continue our friendship. I wanted her to be happy, but I knew I needed space‚Äî and she was not very happy about that. She threw it in my face how I told her I would ‚Äúalways‚Äù be there for her and I was her best friend. And I told her we needed space. We needed it or we would have nothing. Anyway. 

Now, I‚Äôm not a bad guy. And I do love her. And I‚Äôm the type that empowers, not controls, so her life was her life to live. But we have mutual friends, so I still checked up on what she was doing. And it wasn‚Äôt great. She was going bad. First came the alcohol, then the pills, and the party drugs, and finally‚Äî well, I don‚Äôt need to go there. I talked to her mother still after her and I broke up every couple weeks. I let her mother know abt this other guy and his business. Told her that I wasn‚Äôt giving up, that I just needed space. I still wanted her friendship, but things had been getting toxic and any friendship would be lost if we continued that toxicity. And I warned her mother to please just watch out for her. Please just be cautious. And I let her mom know some of what I was hearing here and there, but I made sure to emphasize that what I heard was just that‚Äî hearsay. Rumors. Things that could be or not be true, but I still wanted her to know. 
So during this time my previous ex and I had gotten back together sometime in July and got engaged again. And again, another dark, dark story. But one night my friend told my this girl had started doing what I dreaded she would. And I had to let her mother know. There‚Äôs a line, and I can let some slide, but I wouldn‚Äôt be responsible for an unnecessary death if I could have spoken up and said something. My previous ex wasn‚Äôt too keen on me still caring, but I‚Äôm sorry, a life is a life. So I called her mother the next day. I told her that her daughter was in a rly bad place and she needed, needed to get her back into detox/inpatient. Little did I know that she had OD‚Äôd the day before (the news I heard was abt a day late). The mother told me that her daughter was checking into rehab that next morning. And I asked her mother to please ask her daughter to call me. And she did. I told her that even tho I was away that I was always caring. I never stopped caring abt her as a friend. I let her know that I wanted the space to salvage our friendship, and if we hadn‚Äôt that the toxicity would‚Äôve ruined everything. And she finally saw that. She admitted to me that I had been right all along, but she just needed to learn it on her own. We talked for a good 30minutes before she was admitted, and we patched things up between us. This was now the beginning of August. 

So. My ex was getting the help she needed. I was engaged again to the woman I had been with for almost 14 yrs. And I had my alcoholism just abt under control, or so I thought...

Now this is where I mention without going into much detail that after my 14 year old relationship ended the year before I spiraled. Like big time. Spent thousands and thousands of dollars, suicidal, lost my job, drug/alcohol abuse like crazy, lots of sex with multiple women‚Äî many times in the same night. Just like for real I lost it. It was extremely traumatic for me. Hint: I wasn‚Äôt at fault for the breakup. Add to the fact 3 months before we broke up my 10 year old cousin committed suicide. It was just rough. 2019 was a horrible year for me. But during that year I started seeing a counselor and getting my life back on track. And tbh, things started getting way better for me mentally after I had met that girl in Feb 2020 and we started dating. Like I swear to god she saved my life. I believed in love again after her. And even tho we hadn‚Äôt worked out, the love I have for her is like none other I can explain. Like I rly don‚Äôt know how to explain it. It‚Äôs just there. Like it had always been there. Like everything that happened in my entire life led me to her. But yeah, she saved me. I would probably be dead by now if it hadn‚Äôt been for her. So there‚Äôs that tidbit of history. 

So, mid August my ex is in rehab and we‚Äôre talking here n there‚Äî pretty much just making sure she‚Äôs alright n stuff. I‚Äôm in a relationship. Engaged. The fianc√©e and I are trying to patch up our new relationship from what she had done the previous year. Things were looking alright for me. And then it happened. My fianc√©e left me again‚Äî for the same damn married man‚Äî AGAIN! And I loooooost it. It was like that whole year process of me getting back somewhat ok again was gone. The anxiety attacks. The hurt. The trauma. All of it. Only this time it was worse. It felt condensed. It felt like a year worth of hurt and anguish and the desire of death flooded back like a damn burst. I spoke to my ex in rehab 2 days after my fianc√©e left. And she pleaded with me‚Äî begged me to be careful. Told me when she got out she was maybe hoping she could move in with me‚Äî as a friend, of course. But I was gone. My sanity broke. My soul crushed. I wanted to be nothing‚Äî to feel nothing. See, my problem with alcohol is that I use it not to feel. To numb my brain. I literally had been on a bender for a little over 20 years. Sans 6 days in that 20 years I had not drank. That‚Äôs it. Less than a week in more than 20 years. And when I‚Äôm in a dark spot I would drink until I couldn‚Äôt feel. And then I‚Äôd drink more until I couldn‚Äôt move. And then I‚Äôd pass out and drink again the next day. I‚Äôm what they call a functioning alcohol. And I was for 20+ years until I wasn‚Äôt. That night I talked to my ex in rehab I told her I‚Äôd be ok‚Äî that I‚Äôd try to be safe. And I was for the most part. I was over a friends and then left for the bar. And then I got arrested after I left the bar around 10:30. I was somewhere in the 4-5x the legal limit, yet I was still sober in my mind. I literally still had hours left in me and another 20beers waiting for me that I left at my friends house. The bar was just going to be a quick in/out. Only had like 4 beers n a couple shots. But I had lost it. I ended up being arrested and thrown into the mental ward and put under suicide watch. The officer saw the cuts up and down my arms that I did a couple days earlier. Yes, I‚Äôm a cutter. I hadn‚Äôt done it in many years, but I was a wreck and I felt it was better to cut the pain away then to end the pain. But I‚Äôm not going to lie‚Äî I wanted to die. I was working myself up to killing myself. One last hurrah as it were. Because in my mind I had nothing left to lose. And I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt about to go where I had been again and deal with another year of that pain and suffering. I was over it. That night I ended up going exactly where I needed to. There was no wreck. No speeding. The cop watched me pull out of the bar and took a chance and got me. I‚Äôm not angry abt it. Everything in life happens just as it needs to. I firmly believe that. And this was my time. I spent the next 5days under suicide watch in the mental ward, and then was transferred to a 30 day inpatient treatment facility. I was able to call my ex‚Äôs mother (the one in rehab) to let her know what was going on so my ex wouldn‚Äôt get worried. I did talk to my ex in rehab the night after I got arrested. I wasn‚Äôt moved right up to the mental ward because I needed a COVID test first, so luckily I was able to speak to her once. 

Ok, so if you‚Äôre still bearing with me I am getting close to the end of the backstory. Thank god, right?! Lmao. 

Ok, so I got outta the psych ward and then made it to rehab. Called my ex‚Äôs mom. Told her how I could be contacted. The rehab I was in was great. And it was very low intensity. 3.1 compared to my ex that was in a 3.5 if anyone knows the difference. So I had access to my cellphone and everything where I was. Ok so my ex went in beginning of Aug and I went in mid Aug., so basically I was going to be in around 20 days longer than her. 

Well, while she was in rehab and I was dating my ex on the outside, my ex in rehab met some guy. A good ol fashion rehab romance. (Sweet right?! This story has it all! lol) And when my ex got out this dude AMA‚Äôd with her. Started living at her mom‚Äôs while I was in rehab. Now my ex assured me that this guy was only staying with her for a very short time as he needed a more intense 90 day program and was leaving for that shortly. Whatever. She told me she was ‚Äúenjoying the company‚Äù until then and it wasn‚Äôt anything serious. Ok. Whatever. Not like I could  talk or do much, or for that matter in any kinda mental space to even want anything other than working out my own demons. I needed to do me and get my head right again. So my ex and I talked a bit while I was in rehab. She sent me some nudes/videos for some reason I still can‚Äôt figure out. But whatever. Anyway, while I was in rehab she and new dude started using. Betcha didn‚Äôt see that coming?! She graduated from bumping to shooting‚Äî new dude‚Äôs preference. And then she OD‚Äôd again. I called her PO (while I‚Äôm in inpatient) and told her what happened and talked to her PO for quite awhile. I pleaded with her PO not to throw her in jail, but to get her back into rehab at a new place since the one she had gone to (twice now) was garbage. Her PO saw how much I cared and knew I wasn‚Äôt bullshitting her and so she was lenient on my ex and made her start an IOP program instead. And when I got outta inpatient I started the same IOP. Btw, not that it matters but I wasn‚Äôt court sanctioned into anything. I went to inpatient/IOP on my own. I needed a fresh start in life and something different. Ok, so I think we‚Äôre in the end of September now. I‚Äôm outta inpatient, she‚Äôs outta inpatient, we‚Äôre both in IOP, and dumbass dude is still living with her at her mother‚Äôs. Everyone for the most part is doing what they need to do‚Äî except dumbass dude. Ugh. He never ended up going for that extended treatment he was so intent on going to. Surprise, surprise. lol

Wellllll, as one might suspect she gets knocked up after abt a month and a half of knowing/being with this guy. Yay!!! Right? lmao happy ending!! Well, not quite. I should also say by this time her new dude HATES me. He, uh, well he goes through her phone/social media all the time. Reads all her texts/DMs/etc. Goes through her purse. Just very jealous and has no trust‚Äî kinda like the opposite of me I guess. lol. Well, he read and doesn‚Äôt like the text messages I had sent her from a couple months back and especially the fact he found the pictures/videos she sent me while I was in rehab and forbids her to speaking to me. I mean, we still did/do, but whatever. We‚Äôre like best friends. But like when she sent those, and I sent her the messages I did, they weren‚Äôt even dating so whatever. When they started dating I cut things off again. Told her that she‚Äôs with dude and I‚Äôd be her friend, but I was giving up. She of course didn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt want me to, but that‚Äôs where we were. Well, she ended up using again, falling out, and her mom/dude found her in the bathroom. He calls her PO the next day‚Äî one of the things I did he hated me for (called me a snitch)‚Äî and she gets sent back to inpatient again. She got out beginning of November and we‚Äôve still just been talking since. I mean, her and I never rly quit talking since we met. The only time pretty much was like those 2 months right after we broke up because I told her I would contact her when I was ready again. 

So, yeah, we‚Äôre like rly good friends. Like best friends really. We both trust each other and love each other and it‚Äôs just idk. It‚Äôs like nothing I‚Äôve ever had. For as fucked up n toxic at times and confusing and idk. It just is what it is. 

So since she got out in early November we‚Äôve kept our friendship up as we always have. It‚Äôs just a little different and not as open because we have to hide it from her boyfriend/future baby daddy. And since she‚Äôs been out she‚Äôs been sober. This past time combined with the fact she‚Äôs pregnant has really I think helped her for now. And I myself have been sober since I got out at the end of September or whenever it was. Except for one slip. My buddy‚Äî the one where me and this girl first met‚Äî passed away. And no, it wasn‚Äôt drugs. He had a blood clot in his stomach. It was sudden and just very unexpected. Him n I had been friends for about 20 years. And I planned on just drinking a shot n leaving one for him on the bar, but well, it was my wake up on why I cannot drink anymore because I couldn‚Äôt stop. But in the past 120days or so I relapsed once. I just never dealt with death before sober. Anyway, that doesn‚Äôt matter. 

So, one last thing and then I can get to my question stage and get some opinions I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt like. lol. So while my ex was in rehab this last time her dude started using again. Nodded out, burned tf outta her bedsheets, and just been lying to her and just all of it. Just getting high asf around her and giving no fucks. Hasn‚Äôt gotten a job, makes promises abt going back to school but doesn‚Äôt, keeps telling her he‚Äôs going to go to an IOP program and quit using, etc. All while he should be getting his shit together and saving and getting ready to take care of himself, my ex, and the baby. Mind you, I wanna say he‚Äôs 24, I think. Around that. Idk. But yeah, not my circus not my monkey. She made her bed there‚Äî quite literally. 

So this past weekend he left to go home to see his parents abt 4hrs away or so and was gone until today. And every day since he‚Äôs been gone my ex and I hung out. Went shopping and bought her son some Christmas gifts, went to the mall and walked around. We actually even kinda goofed around and went to the jewelry store and she tried on engagement rings. That was me being kinda sneaky there because it was sumin I always wanted to do with her when we dated that we never got to because of all the bullshit. Hell, we even found a rly nice one that she loved that was within my $7,000 budget (I think it was like $5,500 cuz it was 30% off, princess cut on a cushion kinda setting, carat and a half total weight, and sparkly asf). Lmao! But yeah, I mean we just had a great time all around. And I got to feed the fuck outta her. And I love feeding her. Lmao! Oh, another thing that should be noted is we both have eating disorders. I‚Äôm pretty much anorexic and she‚Äôs a chewer/spitter. Lmao!! We‚Äôre all kinda fucked over here, folks! But now that she‚Äôs pregnant she‚Äôs actually eating and taking care of herself, so I fed tf outta her finally! And we hung out a lot at her moms and just cuddled on the couch and watched tv n stuff. And no, we didn‚Äôt raw dog, or fool around or anything. It was for real just rly nice quality time that we hadn‚Äôt had in a long time now. Oh, and we exchanged Christmas gifts. I got her a Rick n Morty hoodie so she‚Äôll quit trying to steal mine and she bought me a rly soft Animal Crossing blankie. Just small stuff, but we loved them. It was just a rly fun time. 

So like, this is now where the problem is. She told me a lotta stuff Monday night. She told me that I‚Äôm like the perfect guy and she was stupid asf for not seeing it. I told her she wasn‚Äôt stupid‚Äî we were both in active addiction n we both had problems. She said  she completely trusts me and she loves me‚Äî I mean we‚Äôve always told each other we love each other, but I think she meant it a little differently this time. She told me she sees a future with me she doesn‚Äôt with him. She asked me if I still wanted to marry her‚Äî of course, yes I do; and just like a lot of other stuff. She told me she hadn‚Äôt planned on getting pregnant. Sent me a TikTok video of a daughter adopting her mom‚Äôs boyfriend and told me that could be me one day. Told me that she‚Äôs going to end up having 3 baby daddies because of me. And like a lot of other stuff. She‚Äôs not hiding the fact she‚Äôs interested in me still. 

But she also told me she does love this other guy, and she wants to give him a chance to step up and be a man. And I mean, I get it. She wants a clear conscience. She is pregnant with his baby after all. Like, I get her. I rly do. And I feel things like what she‚Äôs thinking. Ffs, I told her she was pregnant before she knew she was‚Äî dumb bitch owes me $50 for that btw! Lmao!! I‚Äôm just kidding abt calling her that, but frl. I was even the first person she told she was pregnant‚Äî even before her mother. Like I know why she wants to do what she‚Äôs doing, but it still sucks for me. And I told her I wasn‚Äôt waiting around for her. That if I find someone (even tho I‚Äôm not looking) I‚Äôll still be her friend, but I mean it‚Äôs all her choice. And she said she wants to give him a chance to keep his word and be sober. To get off the boi‚Äî which ain‚Äôt gonna fucking happen at this point in his life. But she wants to give him a chance. I called her out on that and asked her if I‚Äôm just an option then and she told me no. She thinks of him more of as the option because she sees me being in her life longer than him. Idk. Makes no fucking sense. 

But I mean, even months ago when she first found out she was pregnant I told her I was giving up hope on us being anything more than friends and I was ok with just friends as long as I was in her life, and she told me that I was being stupid and that we can‚Äôt predict the future. That things could always change with us. 

Like I rly do love this woman. I do. With all my heart in a way I‚Äôve never loved anyone, but I honestly don‚Äôt know wtf is going on in her head. And idk if she even does. She rly is smart asf, but like not at all when it comes to relationships. And maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 39 and she‚Äôs 26 and I was in a long ass relationship before her that I got a little more experience than she does when it comes to relationships, but idk. I mean, before her and I dated she dated her first baby daddy for 3 years and he was abusive asf to her. He got her hooked on shit and used it to control her. She doesn‚Äôt have many friends either. And like she‚Äôs insanely beautiful‚Äî like frl like model material, so most guys that come into her life rly only wanna try n fuck her, so she has bad history with that shit. And there‚Äôs been some sexual assaults in there too. So idk, I might be one of the few guys if any that‚Äôs actually treated her as not only a woman, but as a person. So there‚Äôs a lot going on in there I think. And I‚Äôm kinda at a loss on a lot of it. 

And like idk if it‚Äôs only her hormones making her think like this on top of it‚Äî even tho she kinda was saying some of this type of shit before she was pregnant. Like a lot of this is kinda just the same as how it‚Äôs been always been between us. And I wouldn‚Äôt mind being the step-up daddy to her unborn child, or to her first. I know it wouldn‚Äôt be easy, and there‚Äôs a lot that goes into raising a child/children, but I‚Äôm willing to do it. I‚Äôm willing to help her get her firstborn back and deal with all that court stuff. Like I will always, always fight for her and be there for her. I just want to help her and for her to have a happy life‚Äî whether or not it‚Äôs with me. 

But like I saw her yesterday before her boyfriend came back and I brought her some Chick-Fil-A (again, love feeding her n taking care of her) and like she literally sat on my lap and we just hugged and held each other for like 5-10min and then I got up to leave and we hugged again for a long ass time and then she kissed me on the cheek. I could tell she wanted to actually kiss me, but with her dating someone I knew she would‚Äôve felt guilty and didn‚Äôt want to do that to herself‚Äî she said she already feels bad enough over all this as it is. Like again, I can feel what she feels and it‚Äôs super weird asf. 

I just rly don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on here. Anyone got any advice or insight besides get away from her? Any questions I should ask her, or like any topics I should bring up next time we talk? Like foreal, this is the part im here for. I‚Äôm not exactly the best at this relationship shit if you couldn‚Äôt tell by now! Lmao! I‚Äôm much better at getting fucked up and NOT dealing with life. 

I mean, I‚Äôm still working on me. I got a 3 bedroom house a few months back, just started working a government job that pays well, and I‚Äôm going to start working on my TEFL certificate for a side huddle, and then in a few month pursue getting my real estate license. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not doing me still or this is occupying my entire life. It‚Äôs literally one of the few things that idk what to do about. 

I think I gave a pretty good history on us and what‚Äôs going on here, but if anyone wants clarification please feel free to ask questions.

Unfortunately I was introduced to it in the wildest period of my life.That didn't help.

I couldn't walk eat talk play music study be intimate without taking it. 

In 2019 the medication I was taking was no longer available as there was this new regulation that all medications containing codeine needed to be prescribed. ( That helped me quit by the way ) 


I'm not going to talk about my journey of quitting but I want to share with you what I endured after quitting.

I had panic attacks from time to time when using codeine. I would feel some breath shortness and that's it. 



I can not even describe the horror I felt in my first panic attack. I started basically having health anxiety I couldn't bare listen to my heart beating.

One night I I heard  noises in my stomach and I was thrown in a vicious circle of hallucinations. My heart almost stopped I was carried to the emergency my face was pale my mouth dry I was delusional I thought blood vessels in my feet are going to explode it was a nightmare. 

( the doctor conducted blood tests heart tests and told me that I'm fine) 

I almost lost my mind, breath shortness was more horrific I had physical hallucinations, my muscles were twitching ( that definitely didn't help my health anxiety )  parts of my body were going numb. 

I finally saw a doctor and had a treatment that magically helped me.
I thank science every day I didn't get a severe panic attack ever since I finished the treatment. 

I'm clean and my panic disorder and anxiety are under control. 

Please don't use codeine. The physical addiction is hell but the mental one is worse.

I tried going up a little bit but the side effects are terrible for (I can do heroin, fent, dilaudid, hydromorphone etc and not get any side effects) but a fucking mg of suboxone has me feeling like shit and unable to... Tl:dr at bottom

It did not help I recently reconnected with someone recently who I haveng seen in over 10 years, not knowing they are using heavily. Not that I couldn't get it on my own (not exactly hard to find the shit if you really go out and look for it) but having a new number to call at anytime doesn't help anything. I've told him I'm clean and if I ever hit him up asking for anything to just not answer. I was close to texting to him asking how the current dope going around is but I I never sent it. Sorry for that rant.

I keep having reoccurring dreams of using again, except I've gained a considerable amount of weight since getting off everything so hitting a vein would be a pain in the ass, but somehow in the dream my veins just instantly pop out lol.... 

Anyways, if you are getting clean, keep going, it's worth it. I have a car I actually like now, have vocational training set up(when it unfreezes due to covid) so I can actually have a decent paying job to. None of those things would be accomplished while using, I've haven't made many new friends but the couple I have met are nice and a lot less stressful than the normal using buddies I would have met.

I plan on tapering off the subs extremely slowly Jan 1st since I'm getting cravings anyways now so mineswell be completely opiate free.

I was honest with my SO and my therapist, so at least I didn't lie about it... but fuck. I'm trying not to beat myself up too bad. The sneezing and coughing and insomnia seemed to be bottled up. Went 16 days no DOC and 2 weeks since bupe taper... and my addict brain seemed to completely take control and I got really high... and of course felt like shit (physically and goals-wise/emotionally.)  I believe the ""trigger"" was work related fear/anxiety- had a fun get-together with some friends and my SO, had a great weekend really but then on Sunday I was just feeling ""oh shit, Monday and Tuesday are going to be really busy, really stressful days. All the fun is over. You deserve to get high for all the hard work you've put in these past 2-3 weeks."" or something. I don't know. Still thinking about it...

I know the half life of fent can vary so much and that some analogues store in your fat cells. Just for ""science"" sake - - I didn't start sneezing and yawning again until about 36 hours after I stopped. Hopefully I didn't set myself back too much, and since I told the truth to my SO I've effectively cut off my means of getting more. I don't think I'll get withdrawals again, just thrown back into this state of endless PAWS. This virus lockdown seems to really just compound my depression/PAWS issues. I'm really not sure why I didn't just take some bupe, instead I wanted to get high. I also justified it with ""well the bupe will just stay in your system forever, if you're going to put opiates in your body at least do something that has a fast on-set / half life so you can get it out of your system fast and get back on the road to recovery.""

Dope is always close by that it take super strong will power. Fast forward another month I am trying the bernese method. Continued smoking fent regularly but started inducing subs at .5mg doses. Day 2 - 1mg day 3 - 4mg etc.. but I made it up to 8mg but feel like I'm in a constant state of withdrawal.  It's not super bad but uncomfortable.  Like a 5 out of 10 - anixity,  RLS,  skins crawling  no appetite,  so I smoke more fent to try and feel better.. its a constant start the day off best intentions limit my fent and increase my subs but by 3pm no fent taken and 6mg of subs taken I start to feel worse and worse so I increase my fent and hold off on subs then in the evening I take 2mg of subs before bed and start the whole process over. I've been holding at 8mg a day for like 3 / 4 days now and feel so stuck, scared and confused on how to make it past this point. Getting to hour 60 clean was easier because the fent took so long to leave but with the subs in my system it feels like I'm in constant discomfort. I found this tracking of a guy switching from methadone to subs and it took awhile but im just not sure it its supposeto feel like this. .[bernese method tracked](https://i.imgur.com/jUvQ9RY.jpg)

I had clung to those pills, that high for so long and I had no choice but to let go. I‚Äôd had a similar experience with oxy several years before, but I flushed all my pills before it got as far as my addiction to hydrocodone did.

Went for a long walk, it was a clear sky, birds tweetet, and I saw the sun rise over the city where I live and it was just beautyfull. I'm still down, it hasn't just magically disappeared, but something has changed since yesterday. Both internal and external (the weather). 

I also found some weed that had been forgotten. I decided to smoke it... what a relief. Thoughts has slowed down and sweating because of PAWS has stopped (I hate that awful sweating).

So once again I've felt this touch of divinity. Of course life can be really low again tomorrow, I don't know, but for now, just this day and hour, I feel something, I haven't felt in months. I will never follow a certain religion, I keep to my own beliefs, and that's exactly it, I can't help but to believe in something outside of this existence in wich we live. (Always enjoyed psychedelics as well, wich to me more or less always boils down to the aspect of existence).

Well I will stop this awful, for once positive, post, and see if I can return to darkness (Nah not really). If you've come this far I wish you a happy day...",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4389356}"

I‚Äôm looking for any advice I can get.

I met my best friend 2 years ago and we became friends really quickly. I admired her for her vibrant, genuine and kind personality and how easy it was to talk to her.  We originally met through the party/rave scene but ended up becoming close and hanging out sober through other common interests. We moved in together just over a year ago. A few months before we became roommates my friend relapsed with oxys. She has never opened up to me or anyone about what triggered it. Being stupid I also joined her and got high a handful of times. I wish I had done my research on addiction before because I would have never touched the stuff and instead would have tried to get her to open up before she decided to use again. She continued to use on and off but it never seemed like a problem for several months.
Fast forward to March when covid began. We both moved out for a few months to live with our families but kept our apartment. By this point I decided to quit drinking and drugs.

My friend‚Äôs use of oxy quickly progressed to smoking  fentanyl while living at her parents house. I had no idea I just knew something was wrong because we went from chatting every day to me never hearing from her.

3 months later she got called back into work and we moved back into our apartment. It‚Äôs been so hard seeing how far into her addiction she‚Äôs gotten.  I have had so many nightmares finding her dead, and I have a panic attack at least twice a week to the point where I‚Äôve been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and take meds for it now. She‚Äôs my best friend and so I‚Äôm having a really hard time accepting that things will probably never be the same (maybe one day but I can‚Äôt get my hopes up) and that any day could be the last day I see her. 

I know who she truly is and I remember the night around when we first became friends when she proudly told me that she had been clean from opiates for a year and in recovery for 5 years and I was so proud of her. It breaks my heart that this had to happen. 

I wish she wanted to enter recovery again but she has no desire to and even though I‚Äôm her closest friend I can‚Äôt seem to influence her. Many of her other friends have left her and said that once she decides to enter recovery they will be there with open arms. However this actually made her feel very abandoned and increased her drug use. So I just don‚Äôt have the heart to do that. 

On the bright side she is doing the methadone program (but not by her own free will- he was charged with a dui and has to do this program to avoid losing her license). That dui is the main reason she is still chipping. The bright, fun, young woman I knew has completely changed to become pessimistic and hopeless. All of the things we bonded over she has zero interest in at this point. I can‚Äôt seem to get her excited about anything.

She mentioned once in passing that she would do rehab even if it meant losing her job and I really want to have that conversation again but I don‚Äôt know how to go about it. If I say anything that in any way shape or form comes off as controlling or that I know what‚Äôs best for her- she will disregard it and get offended. I don‚Äôt want her to know how much stress it‚Äôs causing me because when I did do that she got pissed off and probably because she felt ashamed. I don‚Äôt want to make her feel bad I just her to feel hope again. I want to be a strong person who can love firmly and have solid boundaries. She is deep in denial but I know that confrontations on that don‚Äôt work. Love is the best approach always. I guess I just need more examples of how I can love and support her without enabling her and also letting myself go in the process.

I have managed to stay sober with the odd night where I will have a few drinks. I also quit weed. I really want to use it but I feel like I can maybe help influence my friend in some way and be a good example of how to enjoy life and be happy with myself sober. I started my masters and have been busy but I still spend so much time worrying about my roommate, constantly trying to learn about addiction how I can help influence her to want recovery. 

At this point I am just trying to do my own thing while still living together, take care of my physical health, hang out with other friends, work on my goals, and not express my anxiety outwardly anymore. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone has been in a situation like this before as a loved one/best friend. Or if you have been in recovery from heroin/fent what really made you decide to approach illumination. I love her from the bottom of my heart. Only last week she said she felt comfortable using while at home. Before she was using alone which frightened me to death and so at least now if she overdosed I can revive her. But aside from that, I also have my own life to live. Rent has become hard for me to afford and I dream of moving to the west coast since my school is based there. 
I know the best thing to do for myself would be to move out in the spring but I worry that she would rapidly decline/die if that happened.

I have put together a list of resources for rehabs, mental health counsellors, and support groups and I would be willing to go to NA or SMART with her. I have not suggested any of these things because I don‚Äôt think she would take me seriously. But please if you have any advice I wholeheartedly appreciate it. 
Sincerely,
Optimistic best friend forever",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5244743}"

120 day update today.  All still stands true of what I said about iboga. 



90 day update. Still clean. still feeling great. No cravings. Never even went through PAWS. I went to a really good program. Again with the right tools and the right mindset Iboga works 100 
percent. 




Just want to give a big up to iboga. That shit works!! 100 percent it does!  I went down to Mexico for 2 weeks to a program. I got with the program and worked it hard for 2 weeks. At the end of that 2 weeks. I was no longer addicted to opiates. I won‚Äôt get into my usage, I will say I was as bad as the worst of us. As far as the trip goes.  It‚Äôs a tough 4 days, but you will find answers to questions you have. You will understand life better.  That‚Äôs all I can really say.  It‚Äôs by no means a cure, but it will give you a huge head start to sobriety.  It will catapult you into that.  I‚Äôm going to meetings as well.  With the right tools and positive energy around you, iboga will work with out a doubt, but you have to truly believe in the medicine and truly want to be clean. If you don‚Äôt make any life changes you‚Äôre going to go right back down the rabbit hole.  Anyone would!! This morning I woke up, and instead of wanting to get high, I made some strong coffee and took my dog for a walk.  I no longer have opiates on my mind.

I am still struggling with a tramadol and tapentadol addiction. There are days when I quit it but I relapse the next and so on.

Tapentadol don't bother me much because its Tramadol the one I took almost everyday and GREAT DOSES. I wonder what damage I am doing to my body taking doses between 400-2000 mg. almost every day. I guess the most likely damage is to the kidneys and liver. Also to my neurotransmitters (serotonin and noradrenaline) that may never work well at all after this. I have also read that tramadol in chronic use causes sterility and, like all opioids, a significant drop in sex hormones. Could it have any damage during these years? I at least feel fine, my urine is normal, I don't feel pain in my kidneys or liver. What do you think? Should I have a full checkup?

If you are unfamiliar with the game, I'm not looking to advertise it or try to convince anyone that it will help them stay sober, it's just a game and I find it to be a fun way to spend some of the free time I have so that I don't succumb to idle hands or my destructive thoughts.

However when I play I usually find myself trying to make friends and it's not always easy players are busy, or already established/have the friends they talk to or are in a clan they are apart of.

That being said I believe that there are other people like me who play this game and understand what it means to me and how even when I've lost everything in real life then reacquired just to lose again, the game was still there and starting over has shown me I can. 

The only thing is I'd love to have friends to talk with in game that are in recovery, or are curious about recovery, or simply just want to be part of something that might get them or a stranger through one more set of 24 hours. I did some digging and seem to have been unable to discover a group that has anything to do with recovery. 

Therefore I have decided to reach out to communities I know of where I might be able to reach people that play and would like to be apart of a clan that is there for one another to enjoy Sober Scaping with. If by chance you play, or know someone in recovery or is in the life of someone who's an addict. or simply someone who just wants to be positive support for one another in a virtual setting feel free to direct message me on here.

Waking up soaking wet with EMTs over you and your family crying. Being brought to the hospital against your will and tied down to the bed. Your mom looking at the doctor and saying this is not my son. You think that would be enough to make a person stop. Nope, not me. 

That would make a rational person stop. But addiction is irrationality,impulsivity and insanity all rolled into one. That‚Äôs just the nature of this disease. My thinking was so warped that I could not grasp what was going on with me. I had completely lost control. I HAD to use. There was no choice. I am sure some of you can relate to this feeling of ultimate hopelessness and despair. I never want to feel that way again. 

I recently relapsed after almost two and a half years clean. It was short and there were not many serious consequences, but it was definitely headed that way. I forgot all about shitting my pants while laying in bed at a rehab facility. Stealing from my family and getting arrested. All I could think about was ‚Äòhmm getting high would feel great right now‚Äô. 

But it just wasn‚Äôt the same. It wasn‚Äôt how I remembered it to be or hoped it would be. It was a week of pain and misery. I haven‚Äôt had fun doing drugs in almost ten years. If I‚Äôm being completely honest though, if it were still fun like it used to be, I may have continued to use.  

They say when the pain of using is greater than the pain of change, an addict will get clean. To me that is the crux of it. Things had to get so bad for me that I was no longer willing to face the consequences of using. Drugs took everything good in my life away. They promised it all and gave me bullshit in return.

I took Tramadol (around 400mg) for pain from Cerebral Palsy for about 5 years. Sick of side effects, I decided enough was enough. I‚Äôd got it down to 150mg per day, and quit. Cold Turkey. About 9 weeks ago. Withdrawal was hell. Major panic attacks, rushed into hospital a few times. Doctors persuaded me to get back on the Tramadol (I KNOW RIGHT!) but I still felt anxious/awful, so tried again, this time with a Butrans patch (the lowest dose). First week was rough AF, then it suddenly got easier. For about a week. The last two weeks have been hell. Especially after a week of feeling like I was okay...

Symptoms: severe muscle spasms, shortness of breath, major panic/anxiety, dark thoughts, feel cold in a neurological kinda way if that makes sense? Muscle tightness is especially awful, my jaw is clenching all the time ATM. Doctor says it‚Äôs generally anxiety, and wants me to take an SSRI; I tried but it made me really bad for shaking, plus I don‚Äôt want to be on anything ultimately. Butrans patch is a huge compromise, I was hoping to be opioid free, but I‚Äôve not coped well. I thought the patch was helping after a couple of weeks, but I took a real dive two weeks in, and I‚Äôm genuinely terrified. I‚Äôm 38/M if that‚Äôs relevant... I‚Äôve read some thoughtful stuff here, so thought I would ask the question. Sound familiar? The spasms and aches are scary - I have CP but it‚Äôs never affected me like that (it‚Äôs classed as ‚Äúmild CP‚Äù) - yeah, any thoughts/advice, I‚Äôd be grateful x

2020-12-16 09:31:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/kea7ii/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"First of all, I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this question. I posted to r/benzorecovery the other day, and someone over there pointed out that this sounds like opiates, and I think they‚Äôre right.

Over the course of the past year, I‚Äôve been having problems with a former friend who takes morphine and benzodiazepines for a number of health issues. She legitimately does need pain management, she‚Äôs not drug seeking and she‚Äôs not obtaining pills through any illegal means. Throughout the time I knew her, she seemed responsible and knowledgeable about her health issues, so I didn‚Äôt suspect any kind of substance abuse or other issues. She also has a housemate/partner who I would think would notice if that became an issue.

In the past year, she‚Äôs changed. She gets explosively angry about things I don‚Äôt understand, and she bursts into tears at times of stress. She forgets entire conversations that I remember us having, and has recounted very specific memories of other things that I *know* didn‚Äôt happen - but I also know she‚Äôs not a liar, and wouldn‚Äôt have made those things up. She is/was a kind, thoughtful, intelligent person, but there have been times this year when she screamed at me on the phone or where I felt like she wanted to hurt me or kill me, and others when she would seem completely apathetic about important things like her own safety (or mine). Trying to talk to her felt ‚Äòoff‚Äô in a way that it never did when I first knew her, like she just didn‚Äôt understand or retain information the same way anymore. I would try to connect with her, and she would just stare at me. I thought that I had driven her to hate me for some reason I didn‚Äôt understand, but now I wonder if it was something else. I couldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore, if I disagreed with her or pointed out something I thought she had forgotten, she would start screaming that I was an asshole and that she hated me. I look back at old emails from her, and it seems like they were written by a completely different person.

I‚Äôm not exactly looking for an armchair diagnosis because I know I can‚Äôt know exactly what‚Äôs going on, and if I had a chance to help, I obviously fucked it up. But I wonder if there was an obvious case of substance abuse right in front of me and I didn‚Äôt do anything. Her benzo use scared me a little because she went through a stressful event last year, and seemed to desperately need them in order to cope, but I wouldn‚Äôt have known how to approach the issue and she said she was well aware of the dangers and was being careful, so I didn‚Äôt really say anything because I didn‚Äôt think it was my place. I wasn‚Äôt worried about the pain meds, because she never seemed to be ‚Äòemotionally attached‚Äô or to crave them, she acted like they were just a necessary evil in order for her to manage her pain. She didn‚Äôt seem to have a problem, but now I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt really know. She lives in another state, and I don‚Äôt share any mutual friends with her who can give me a sanity check here. There are so many things that don‚Äôt make sense to me about her behavior, and I can‚Äôt tell if I am crazy or if this is something that should have been obvious to me all along. 

Are these just unavoidable side effects for someone who needs opiates for pain, or should I have said something? She‚Äôs talked about how the side effects of medical marijuana make it impossible for her to function, and as far as I know, morphine is the only thing that has really worked for her.

At one point when I was hanging out with her last summer, she said that her vision was tunneling, she couldn‚Äôt stand up and started falling forward in a way that, looking back, reminds me of videos of heroin users nodding. She wasn‚Äôt really conscious, but she said she didn‚Äôt need an ambulance, just for me to stay with her and make sure she was still  breathing. At the time, I didn‚Äôt know what medications she was taking, or what her specific health issues were, but I believed it was an awful side effect to something that she would obviously tell her doctor about later.

For no particular reason. I have heard many stories about how addiction is a disease or a learning disorder or something that simply cannot be controlled. For me, the simplest explanation was the most true. I liked how it made me feel. A lot. But in the end, opiates became something that was no longer tenable. I felt like I was just wasting time. I paid for my oxy use by loss of my interest areas, which were martial arts and biology. Not to mention that I wasn't very interested in girls unless they had a superior connection, in which case I was their new bestest friend.

So anyway, I finally decided that enough was enough and decided to taper. I had ct'ed maybe 4-5 times before. All but one were enforced when I was thrown into rehab or jail. I did not want to go down that road again.

So I bought a bunch of oxy from my girl, went to a doctor and got scripts for soma, temazepam and clonidine. I started off with 60 mg twice a day. Dropped to 30. Then down by 2.5 mg at a time. My milestone was if I felt high. If so, I was doing too much. It took about 3 weeks but finally got to 3.5 mg. 

It wasn't easy or quick and thank god for those comfort meds. I took the least possible amount of those, as I have never been a big fan of sedatives. But they dampened out some of my misfiring brain circuits and helped with the sweating and twitching.

So I just finished and no, I don't feel good but I know it will be better in time. I think you have to decide what you want, and then it is not so hard to do.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4572389}"

But I wanted to get clean, and the biggest hurdle for me was waiting the 24-72 hours to avoid PWD and taking time off work having withdrawals. That just wasn't an option for me. So I used a modified Bernese method that I think people should at least know about. I have read multiple articles, but would first refer you to this graph on the bupe per-mg-dosage/available-receptor ([https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gC6SRQ5KATWjfFsRIS1I\_YJKrICN1r2MTifn0S39r5BbYp4OJyvPj5PCxT19m2uckSx43zAk1ioi\_6OSXPjx\_EYfDRltUGQcmdFnHiI](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/gC6SRQ5KATWjfFsRIS1I_YJKrICN1r2MTifn0S39r5BbYp4OJyvPj5PCxT19m2uckSx43zAk1ioi_6OSXPjx_EYfDRltUGQcmdFnHiI)). It's where I've come up with my hypothesis for how to slowly introduce bupe to your brain chemistry and slowly allow bupe to occupy more u-opioid receptor sites, while you continue to take your DOC. Eventually your DOC will do nothing, the bupe will occupy 100% of all receptors and you can just stop your DOC completely with no withdrawals. And THAT is the first AMAZING feeling. That said, my schedule will NOT be the same as yours. If you IV / or use a lot of fent, I would probably use a 4 day schedule. That being said, here's what I did with my 4x 8mg bupe pills.

&#x200B;

**Day 1**

*.125mg bupe at 7am*

I didn't really feel this dose at all. I figured it was pointless, but looking back, it was a very import step. The first microdse will be where you start to ""stack"" doses since bupe has such a long half life (up to 48 hours)

&#x200B;

**Day 2**

*.5mg bupe at 7am*

This is where I felt PWD creep. I immediately did some of my DOC to balance out - and continued to do my DOC the rest of the day. *I microdosed abother .125* in the afternoon. It's all about ""feeling"" your brain chemistry. You are replacing/tricking your brain from having a full agonist to bupe - a partial agonist.

&#x200B;

**Day 3**

*1mg bupe at 7am*

At this point you'll have close to 2mg of bupe in your system. You'll notice on the graph that 50% of your receptors will be occupied by bupe. It was day 3 that I said ""fuck it"" and started taking 1mg every 2-3 hours. I would feel PWD creep up, and then I'd smoke black. Rinse and repeat. Before I knew it I had 8mg of bupe in my system, 90% of my u-opioid receptors filled, and felt fine.

&#x200B;

**Day 4**

*I took 2mg of bupe* in the morning. And that's it. I went all day feeling pretty decent. Not 100%, but the fact that I had no cravings, no desire to spend money on fucking drugs, and didn't do any of my DOC. I didn't feel high, and didn't want to. I was DONE with getting high. And you are too. If you get this far, great! If not, do another day where you ramp down your DOC use, and ramp up your bupe use.

&#x200B;

**Days 5-?** 

**Now we just have to taper off this damn bupe - it's another tight-rope walk.** Just like you replaced a full-agonist opioid with a partial agonist and tricked your brain into think ""Oh it's all good, I don't need to throw you into withdrawls"" - you have to swap bupe with natural endorphins and feel-good brain chemicals. Your brain WANTS to produce these. Sometimes I feel like a Jedi, I meditate and think ""Go ahead brain, give me some dopamine and serotonin"" and I'll get a chill all over my body. I know this is just the withdrawals, and sounds stupid. But fuck it. I'm a Jedi, or a god, or a level 99 human or something. Exercise is also key. Running while listening to some amped up music is a sure fire way for your brain to release natural chemicals. So use the bupe to your advantage. And taper down and quickly as possible. For me, I took bupe for three more days...

&#x200B;

**Day 5**  
1mg bupe

&#x200B;

**Day 6**  
.5mg bupe

&#x200B;

**Day 7**

Nothing. At this point, you still have a TON of bupe in your system. And it takes 9 days for all if it to clear. This is as soft a landing as you're ever going to get. It's not exactly easy, but it's definately NOT full blown withdrawls. For me, it feels like I was thrown straight into PAWS. So buckle up. It's all in your mind. All the normal comfort meds will help. Gabapentin, loperamide, vitamins, 5-HTP, L-Tyrosine, Vitamin-C. I took them all at different times, seeming at random. But I never got any RLS, no crazy vomiting or diahreah, no tossing and turning for sleep (although I am taking Xanax for sleep, which I am now tapering down. I'm down to 1mg/night) I still have about 8mg of bupe left, but I haven't needed it. I plan on taking some if I ever feel like relapsing. Which would be stupid. I'd be blocking myself from getting high and just fucking up my brain chemistry. But it's better than going back to drugs.

So that's my story. I am so devoted to never touching an opiate again, you have no idea. If you have psychological issues, or aren't truly dedicated to quitting, this method isn't for you. But if you aboslutely HAVE to avoid the 2-7 days of wretching withdrawals, I believe this is a good option. I've continue to do most of my work, and most people have no idea what I've been going through. To others I just am ""having a bad month / depressed"". If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

I am not a doctor. Please be careful out there. I have no idea if the above is a miracle, or if ""I'm on to something"" - and I'd feel horrible if you tried the above and got put through hell. So please do your own research, take it slow, and be careful!",30,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49087057}"

I have relapsed 6 times throughout the year. 3 of them I overdosed. All were for a day just slow my thoughts and breathe. I am 4 months clean and it's the longest I've gone in 10 years. In these for months I've done plenty of research on how to help me gain control of my mind but with Covid getting help hasn't been easy.. I do smoke weed to stop craving dope and that helps. It slows my thoughts so I can process through them and not race through them. I still struggle socially and lack confidence. As a 27 yr old male my struggles to others make them see me as weak I feel like. My childhood plays a part in this. I was severely bullied and never allowed to fit in anywhere and was always made to feel small. I self medicated for to long and now I'm in a fight for my life to figure it out. I diet (not strict but healthy) I exercise and I have a beautiful loving family that I don't know how to love. 

One thing that has caught my attention is MDMA/Psylicybin/Ketamin treatments. I think I would be willing to try them but idk how to look into getting into clinical trials or something.

I have been browsing the internet and this site and can‚Äôt find much relating to the specific situation I am currently in. So my husband (as of 1 month ago) & I are both in recovery. I‚Äôve got a year clean and he has about 8 months. We met in treatment and had right around the same clean date but he relapsed in the beginning and had to go back. Anyway he got out and I decided that despite the fact he relapsed and lied I loved him and wanted to be with him. I chose to focus on the person I know that he is -or can be. We have been so incredibly happy, we have a daughter on the way, due in April and I literally couldn‚Äôt ask for a better life partner. One of the stipulations of my taking him back was that he get in the vivitrol shot which he‚Äôs done and maintained since. If you are familiar with this shot then you know that using is still possible but seemingly pointless. 

Now let me que you in on what‚Äôs been going on in my head and why. He has a job that entails a commute of an hour and 20min both ways each day and he works early mornings so it‚Äôs easy for him to explain all of what I‚Äôm about to tell you away with sleep deprivation. The past couple weeks when FaceTiming him on his way home from work his eyes have looked heavy and I‚Äôve mentioned it to him and he just brushed it off and said it was because he‚Äôs so tired and doesn‚Äôt get enough sleep. Which he doesn‚Äôt. Well then a few days ago he had an apt for an oil change up in the city (which is also where he works) and he got off work pretty early that day so he stayed up there to kill time and I FaceTimed him while he was at the dealership and he was literally sleeping. Answered the phone to me and was barley conscious and nodding while we were on the phone. The thing is, his pupils don‚Äôt look any different, his voice still sounds the same.. none of the other signs are there, but if he is on the shot then would they be? To top it all off, he wrecked his car on his way to work 2 days ago from falling asleep at the wheel. Again he says that he was just really tired works early mornings, long drive, etc. His family and I have been talking and we share the same suspicions. I picked up a drug test from his mother and had him take it last night and he passed which we were expecting because a standard drug test doesn‚Äôt test for fentanyl and that has been his primary DOC. I can‚Äôt believe his family has been dealing with this much longer than I have and still hasn‚Äôt made it a point to have drug tests on hand that are actually effective. Anyway I finally found some affordable tests on Amazon and ordered them today. They won‚Äôt be here for a few days and if he did use, he‚Äôll be clean by then but having them on hand for future reference will make me feel so much better. I love this man and I‚Äôve never been on this side of things as, I myself, am an addict. But I have kids, we have one of our own on the way and his actions no longer just affect him and his family. 

I guess I am just needing advice. 
Thanks in advance, 
                          Hannah

The doses you need to take vary on the users tolerance, but I think like 3-5 grams every few hours is actually the lower end of the megadosing.

I've tried immodium tapers, kratom, benzos, lyrica, and just in general all the supplements under the sun. I cant handle opiate withdrawal. I mean I can, I have before, but I'm a huge pussy coming off of a 80-90mg hydro a day habit. If I took 20mg I wouldnt even get high anymore, just not in withdrawal.

I'm in day 3 of WD and the only symptom I have if I keep up with proper dosing throughout the day is the occassional yawn or leg ache. About 95% of the WD... completely fucking gone. Yeah. Literal fucking wizardry, right?

Please, please, PLEASE dont write this off as bullshit, or psuedoscience. I'm fucking serious. Just TRY it. Or at least read about it. iNdULDgE me.

Nothing, and I mean fucking nothing, has helped me through withdrawals like this ever, I feel like I found a miracle that was meant to be buried under methadone clinics and suboxone programs.

The ONLY reason I'm posting this is because this vitamin C has saved me so much god damn pain, and you guys all deserve to know about this too.

I should be throwing up on the shower floor crying right now, but instead I actually have fucking hope. It doesnt just help me with WDs too but that dark fucking cloud you get where everything just feels hopeless and empty is gone too. I can actually fucking do this, I could cry right now. 

I actually got like 9 hours of sleep last night, WHILE IN WITHDRAWAL thats unheard of for me!! Initially I fell asleep with the nighttime dose of Vitamin C, and I slept for 5 hours, but I woke up at 4am in cold sweats and snot, took another 4 grams of vitamin C and within 15-30 mins I felt relief and could sleep again and cuddle up next to my girlfriend. Normally I'd be up all night in a living hell, with 2 hours of sleep if I was lucky.

Oh and also Vitamin C is nontoxic, you cant overdose.

Here's a study from 2000 that showed Vitamin C megadosing helped allievate withdrawal in heroin users.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10836211/

I'm a skeptic typically, but this actually works.
Here's some anecdotal experiences/proof as well. They all align with what the study from 2000 found.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Opiatewithdrawal/comments/cg9rn9/vitamin_c_for_minor_opiate_withdrawal/

Note: There are 2 main kinds of Vitamin C you can take for this. Sodium ascorbate, or absorbic acid. They both work, but absorbic acid will give you gnarly ass diarrhea. If you only have absorbic acid, immodium helps with the diarrhea. Just dont take more than like 1 pill because we dont want to be extending our WDs here

TLDR; Vitamin C megadosing (4000mg+) is actually a miracle. Just making this post in the hopes that I can share this to someone who didnt know about this and save them from a horrible withdrawal.

In the beginning, ""episodes"" would last 1 day at a time and cycle quickly, but I'd run through depressed days, elated days, and neutral/""normal"" days each multiple times a week. Now i can go a month or 2 or more at baseline, BUT the episodes have gotten longer and ""stickier"" when they occur. 

I just had the worst stretch yet: what felt like about 2 solid months of hypomania, followed immediately by a 3 week crash of the most crippling, hardy depression I've ever had. Im still in some moderate depression (another 3 weeks later) but at least I'm functioning now.

I keep waiting to get better but feel like I'm getting *worse*, and it's interfering with my life. I keep thinking I'm in the clear and then getting knocked on my ass harder than even before. I'm starting to wonder if I actually have (or developed?) bipolar or major depressive disorder.

Does this sound like it can still be attributed to PAWS based on your experience?? I'm pretty doctor-resistant but beginning to feel like I may need to see one for an evaluation. If this sounds like it's still normal at this point of my journey I'd rather skip that and go to a naturopath for a little balancing just to get me through the rest of the way.


TL;DR: major mood swings getting worse/longer at 1.5 years off all substances. Is this likely still PAWS or do I need to look into the possibility that I uncovered some more serious mental health issues?",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.73094827}"

I was getting rly good fent dope for 120 a g, eventually I did .5-1.5g a day. Recently I was kinda forced by being on money so I came clean to my family and 2 days later I have a script of 12mg hydroxyzine for anxiety. I have severe anxiety, especially social, and haven‚Äôt left the house without 900mg gabapentin daily for the last year or so, but massive doses before that. Then I ordered etizolam and got addicted to benzos. I hope they don‚Äôt show up on the pee these when I go see my sub doc again in a week. Gabs give me energy and these bullshit glorified Benadryl (hydroxyzine) put me right to sleep, so how is that safer to drive on????? My only hope is etiz doesn‚Äôt show up cuz this is USA and a state where it‚Äôs legal. And I only have like 600 mg of etiz left, it helps tremendously  but I take up to 10mg a day. I CTd them a month ago but when I got home from where I went to cut off my access to them, I found more in my room and relapsed that night. I hope the only reason I pissed dirty for benz at the hospital (had to get tested before getting referred to sub doc)is from flualprazolam. But the thing is I have a bottle of diclazepam (RCof diazepam that lasts 2 days of no wd) in my room I‚Äôve been looking for for months. But Ik that‚Äôll probably show up. But my friend goes to the same doc and said he has failed for H every single time he goes there, so I hope she‚Äôll let it fly because otherwise I‚Äôm gonna have to never leave the house and become a welfare case. Anyways the important thing is I‚Äôm not do h/fent whatever it is. I feel like I‚Äôll relapse if my money gets up again but I rly don‚Äôt want to, but now that I‚Äôm my guy gets carfent and carfent breaks on through bupe pretty easy it‚Äôll be hard af not to. Oh and I‚Äôm an independent contractor so idk what I‚Äôll do when tax season comes and broke. Not to mention how much stress I‚Äôve put my grandparents through.

Knowing what truly serves me has been key. Physically/mentally. Fent. Is the worst. I feel it is the worst of all evils. It changed my mind and values. Its cheap makes you sick and doesn't let go. Now I can only rise from the ashes I have created and live with the hurt I created. But nonetheless can reach back and help. To my community you can do this, you are strong enough. Hope and faith can help so much but I cannot stress having healthy ways to cope with triggers is so important.

 One thing that helps me if available is call someone that understands and cares. It brings so much stress off my back to talk someone that gets it. Im lucky to have a friend thats supportive and has been there with me through it. I am here if anyone is alone and doesn't have that friend to talk. 

Paws from fent have been strange. I have insomnia, rls,anxiety, and oversensity to say the least. All are still very prominent.

I cried for 2 hours straight while listening to music, took a shower then took a dab. Thank god for thc, because I would absolutely die without it. 

In the beginning of my recovery, I just kept thinking that this wasnt the last time I was going to shoot h or fet, like there was nooooo wayy I was done. And my bf knew I felt that way, and admitted to me that the reason he kept saying ""maybe we'll get a bag on whatever day"" alot, and it was so I  would take my suboxone? Idk I feel like that fucked me up, mentally. I know he meant good, but that just kept me more in denial. 

I think maybe I iust really felt it, like mourning the needle and the process and the picking up and everything that goes with it. I still havent even thrown out my old needles, jesus I have like over 300- no joke. I always bought the 100 pack, and we BLEW through them. Even spooons, still, make me tweaky. I know its stupid.

I go to my suboxone appointments every 2 weeks now on wednesdays and I have a 1on1 therapist ive been seeing for 8 years , every week/2weeks. But ive only seen her twice since everythings opened. We had to meet outside at a picnic table behind the building, which was fine. Idk why im avoiding going to therapy,I I like therapy- and  my therapist! its just weird because I wanna talk about it but sometimes I just dont. I dont wanna re live it and have memories and flash backs. 

I had a flashback/panic attack to being on my back on the carpet in the basement and I was coming back from narcan after an od (on new years morning @8am) and the emts and police were there. It happened when I was in the garage with a friend, about to smoke and he had one of those pouches you crack open or whatever and sniff it and it wakes you up.I didnt know what it was, he just shoved it in my face and by reaction and I just sniffed it- I literally felt like I just got narcand and started freaaakingg tf out. I was super wrecked and just smoked and left.üòï Ive been getting triggered i guess, alot lately by different things. songs, places, clothing, pictures and videos on my snapchat history and memories. 
so if anyone has any advice on how I can emotionally and mentally handle this. Ive been trying to color, just in general to help take my mind of everything- hopefully it helps!

 Im sorry I went on and on, I figured if anyone would understand- it would be you guys ‚ô° also please try and hold back from rude comments, I appreciate it ‚ô°

2020-12-12 14:46:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/kbvhth/we_finally_did_it_my_wife_and_i_both/,We finally did it (my wife and I both),"It‚Äôs not going to sound like a lot and I can only imagine how many of these get posted but I literally have no friends in my life at this point that either know or would care to.

I met the woman that would eventually become my wife nearly 6 years ago. I had just been fired from my job as a systems administrator and as a result ended up homeless for a few weeks (no savings as I‚Äôve always been bad with saving). I mostly just slept in my car in a friends apartment parking space. Hey, it worked.

Two friends whom I owe so much offered to let me crash in their couch while I figured things out. At this point this was about 2 weeks after officially being homeless so a relief to say the least. This is where I met my wife.

She was a tall mixed girl with big work boots on and a Big box store uniform to match. Long black hair and glasses. I was toast. Enamored from that point. 

Long story short she was in an abusive relationship at the time with someone that would later be diagnosed as schizophrenic. 

Anyways, flash forward a few years. She almost immediately left that guy for me and we were instantly in love. Never in my life had something happened that immediately felt right and never stopped being right... even to this day.

My wife had always struggled with back pain. Untreated scoliosis found during adolescence (her mother refused to have her treated for it for many bad reasons) became worse over the years working retail inventory management, moving couches etc. The final total was a bulged disc/k?, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. She was placed on Norco 10 and and lyrica for the pain and kept chugging. All was fine until she became pregnant with our son. Her medications were restricted to 2 tiny Tylenol 4 a day for 9 months which is obviously not enough. After the birth of our son, she was unable to return to work and subsequently her medication. She was placed on my insurance after marriage and started a new doctor in our new town. This doctor was adamant that the 10mg oxycodone and lyrica was overkill and that she would be removing her off those medications in favor of steroids and therapy. Neither worked and my wife was forced to acquire these medicines elsewhere as a result.

Eventually she met an old high school friend who sold roxycodone. These were great. 10mg that my wife could take and not be in pain albeit enormously expensive in the long run. As you can probably imagine things didn‚Äôt stay that simple. When the pinks ran out, we got bumped up to the green 15s. At this point I developed a taste for them to get me through my workday so I could come home and have energy for my son. When those ran out when got 30s and this is where things turned bad. At some point we were bait and switched. The actual pharmacy m30 pills got switched to fent presses and my wife and I were too ignorant to know the difference. We weren‚Äôt druggies, we just had A few though the week on bad days and never had issues going weeks between. But after we started getting the fent presses, we found that even after less than a day, we were feeling like crap. Only thing that would fix it would be swallow another quarter. We thought we knew what was happening but always passed it off as we will just taper off and it would be no problem (we still thought they were pharma 30s).

This started a nearly year long feedback loop of addiction that hit us so fast we didn‚Äôt even realize it until it was too late. We used 2 a day for a total of about 7 months then later learned they were indeed presses. That‚Äôs so much money. Luckily by this point I had found work in Pharma lol working in IT so I made great money.

A week ago those 30s ran out. Our plug wasn‚Äôt able to get them anymore and we were thrown into the worst thing I have ever been through in my entire life. I‚Äôm not even going to talk about the last several days because they are behind me. My wife and I were able to find some thing to ease the pain. Some roxy 10s and a few bupe strips. Nothing helped at all. Fent is too strong. It‚Äôs poison you don‚Äôt even realize you‚Äôre taking sometimes.

Moral of the story is my wife and I are now addicts. A full week clean, but still addicts. But I am done with this. I am thinking almost clearly for the first time in years.  I can see the path before us and know if we can stay clean we will have everything we would ever want. We are such a warm, successful family that got pulled into this opiate crisis faster than we could even imagine. 

If you‚Äôre thinking about trying these things for the first time, do your self a favor and tell someone so you can get help. It‚Äôs so not worth all this. Part of me wants to start advocating for addicts after having gone through whatever went though. Who knows?  What I do know is I‚Äôm a week clean with a clean life ahead of me and I can‚Äôt wait to get closer to it.

I totally understand some folks whom quit opiates are able to still smoke green/edibles, and maybe drink socially here and there. They are able to show some discipline. 

However, if you‚Äôre going to still mix a bunch of uppers/downers and every drug across the board, there is no fucking way you‚Äôre quitting heroin. Maybe you quit for a month or so, but your lifestyle doesn‚Äôt change and your brain never rewires/heals. 

Personally, I think you need some serious time away to reflect, heal, understand, change, and grow. If you‚Äôre still filling your day with drugs, are you advancing?

Hi everyone, 
This is my first Reddit post ever and I‚Äôm not sure how this works so bare with me. I‚Äôm 22, and I got introduced to percs earlier this year by some friends and was hooked almost immediately... I was on them (snorting) for about 3 months (about 1/4 a day, which then eventually became about 1/2 a day) and wasn‚Äôt even aware that it was a problem until my plug ran out so I went cold turkey and I went through withdrawals for a couple days and I have never felt anything like it.... I literally felt like I was going crazy, I was panicky & scared (I have anxiety already so this made it so much worse) & then after I felt normal again. I went a couple months without them but I relapsed mid October and have been doing them ever since, I now go through a pill and a half or 2 (doing it in 1/4 or 1/2) a day. I went to see my family without taking any percs in Nov and had the worst withdrawals (had cold sweats, had a full blown panic attack, couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt remember how it felt to be normal and felt so out of touch of reality) that I had to come back from the trip days early (I was only there 3 days because I couldn‚Äôt take it...) but I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore, I feel like a slave to this shit. I want to feel like myself again so I decided to quit cold turkey but I am so scared of what‚Äôs to come for the next couple of days. I‚Äôve looked through the sidebar for some withdrawals tips/things to make it easier and am hoping to get CBD gummies to at least help me sleep since I work two jobs and have finals this weekend and next week.... just my anxiety is so bad right now for what‚Äôs to come and I have already started getting cold sweats/dilated pupils. I would have weened off but I want to be done and have not been on it for very long. I just want to be reminded that it will be okay and that I won‚Äôt feel like this forever because it gets real dark in my head. 

TL;DR I am quitting percs cold turkey and would love some moral support/success stories/advice/any niceness is greatly appreciated.

I wish I had started sooner, since I'm sure the improvement would have even been more dramatic. Anyway the chart in the image link below shows my daily sleep for each night since 11/15/2020. Because my sleep is still all over the place, I included a 7-day moving average to help discern the trends. For the most part I have attempted to sleep as much as I possibly could each night. There are maybe one or two days where I had to cut sleep short to get up and start my day, but for the most part each day reflects how much I was able to sleep each night.

According to the ""sober time"" app, I'm at 5 days and 2 hours clean from a decade long codeine (and sometimes dihydrocodeine and tramadol) addiction and doing remarkably well all things considered.

I've managed to quit before only to relapse when I saw some pills available and just took them without thinking.

This time is different as I was able to resist taking some earlier today when a box of nurofen plus tablets came in the post which I'd forgotten I'd ordered - instead gave them to my wife to get rid of.

Anyway, my questions:

1 - I was taking 32 pills (12.4mg each) daily before I got clean, I'm wondering if anyone knows how long it's likely going to take to get over the intense cravings

2 - What is the best way to handle the long term depression symptoms? I found that the hardest last time I quit before relapsing hard

3 - I'm trans and believe that this is a big reason for why I got addicted since when I get attacks of genital dysphoria it helped a lot. For those unfamiliar, basically imagine suddenly becoming hyper aware of your genitals and feeling so uncomfortable you want to rip it off your body - codeine seemed to always relieve these episodes.

B went through recovery last year after a year of heavy use and we all thought he had kicked his habit. Turns out friend B has seduced A into smoking fentanyl for a while. Not sure how long but A admits to at least 2 months of daily smoking.

After all of this came to surface A said he would quit and no longer meet B. A also tells us not to belittle him so much as he was not a serious user. However A also never showed withdrawal symptoms. We thought it might be beause he did not use much during the two month period that he admits to have smoked.

Around two weeks after A was first caught he calls me in serious pain talking abouth withdrawal symptoms. He saids its been 48 hours and he feels like shooting himself with a gun and that he will never touch this thing again. Sounds like its his first time being aware of how serious this drug is. I feel relieved as its the first real sign of him actually quiting.

But we later find out that B came to A‚Äôs house that night and gave A some fentanyl. A said he only smoked two tiny strips. Later admits B gave him a tiny amount as well.

Then A calls a bunch of friends the day after telling them to come over and smoke some weed. A sounds super happy. We are all perplexed.

A never went through heavy withdrawal again and claims because he already went through 48 hours of hell the tiny amount he smoked during the 55 hour mark did not starts thing over but eased the withdrawal pain and he did not have to go through heavy withdrawal again. Does this make sense?

I have other clues but mainly gut instinct that he is still using..mainly because he never went through the intense pain again nor did he ever really apologize for his actions and deceit but is prideful and even makes statesments as he might smoke for two or three days straight next year because he knows he cant get addicted with such use.

his family doesnt believe me and he tries to makes me into the crazy person. He saids im using my experience with B and thus seeing A in a skewed way. He yells at me telling me to stop it and get out of my head and that he already quit. What do you think?

can he have really quit since two months use isn‚Äôt that much? is a slight amount of use during the 55 hour withdrawl mark okay? Is it the professional and safer way to quit?",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49980605}"

Recently I caught an aggravated unlawful use of a weapons charge and my girlfriend of 2 years had to spend 1500 to get me out on bond. I lied and told her I would pay her right back and there was money in my safe. She bonds me out and when we get to our apartment she throws my keys at me and says I went through your safe ..there's no money in it. Which I knew all along. I handed her the last 500$ I had and knew I didn't want this life anymore. I always find amazing people and end up breaking them down in so many unforeseen ways due to my addiction. The lying, not remembering anything, always secluding myself to the bathroom for hours just to be alone, and never keeping my word.

I decided to come clean and told her on October 15th that I had been using again and to bare with me because I am about to go through a special kind of hell of which she has never imagined. We have a ring camera in our living room and she would often see me take a bath, lay down for 15 minutes, start jumping due to RLS, and go take a bath again....all night.
After day 2 I caved and took kratom....and went back to norco 3 days after. 200mg a day.

So now here I am 2 months later, with 2 8mg subs. I indicted myself with 2mg about an hour ago and my back is still tingling/burning but I'm not taking any more subs tonight. I only want to take 16mg throughout 10 days to get through the worst of my WDs and claim my life back and be able to have the glimmer back in my eye and a smile on my face. I used to love to be numb. Now I don't even remember what laughing until your cheeks hurt was like....

So please be gentle i beat myself up enough already.

So im almost a year on methadone maitnence. But i started using fetnyal in june on top of it...yeah. I know. My clinic only tests for fetnyal if you have H in your system. So for the past few months my dumb addict mind is like ""oh cool i can use and save money hur dur"". In the begenning i could stop and start as i pleased. But now i have to have fetnyal or ill go into withdrawl. The methadone hardly does anything. If i try my mental state goes into a demonic bad trip and its hell in my brain. Ive even taken 3 of my doses at once and it didnt last. I ruined it all. It was working so well. I dont want to tell them cause ill lose take home privleges....also the worst part is my fiance had no clue. I know i hate myself for it and my counselor and I are working on this, he wont leave me over it or anything but thats a whole other story.
But me having take home privleges helps me from finding a new excuse every damn morning at the same time to leave. It goes hand in hand and i might as well tell everyone if im gonna tell my clinic. Ive got no one to talk to other than the internet and my counselors. But they dont know about the fetnyal. 

Can someone give me a tapering schedule maybe? The fetanyal is in pill form...Do i start asking for dose increases while i decrease my fet use? I want to stop more than anything i hate that i ever did it. It ruined the whole point of recovery. I want to be okay for real. Im so tired of my entire life being one big fucking lie. I want to do this program right. I need off the fet ASAP. I have also tried not taking as much methadone and using more fetanyal so that my methadone tolerance is down. It helped a little bit but not enough. Going cold turkey isnt much of an option due to the extreme depression and anxiety it puts me through. Im not strong enough for that. Its not an option. I need to get out of this without anyone but reddit/online NA knowing. Like i said, the withdrawl cold turkey is psychological hell for me and i do not trust myself to do that. I become suicidal.

My usage is about 4-6 (10mg) hydrocodone per day. I have been taking these daily for about 3 months and the usage started at about 2-3 per day and scaled up to where I'm at now. I was not prescribed these, I take them recreationally.

I am no stranger to addiction, I've battled it for years, but I manage to keep myself from getting too, too deep. I've settled for very long bouts in the past of using Kratom and always find myself toying around with opiates. I stay away from the real hard stuff because I have very close family who have had their lives destroyed by it. This doesn't keep me from 'dabbling' with pills however, it is has kept me from going too far off the deep end.

Not sure why I'm providing the back story, really I just want to ask....how bad will this be? Any advice on a taper strategy? Or would you recommend cold turkey? I'd like to be off of these by Christmas and I want to come up with a rock-solid plan to avoid going off the rails. If a prolonged taper strategy is recommended I want to obtain the necessary amount and be disciplined about it. It may be beneficial to know that I took off work the week of Christmas and in the back of my mind I sort of did this to mentally prepare to be clean by then.

(Sorry for the wall of text. TL;DR at the end)

Hi, I'm trying to stay sober for periods of time but I feel that my addictive habits make that really hard, like if I have drugs in the house, I'm thinking about them, planning to use them, waiting to do them, no matter how long I say I'll wait. It just feels like I don't have the self control I guess. I also felt very very hesitant t make any post because honestly, I don't feel like I've done much or am at a level where this type of support is expected. I'm 13, I've done some weed, nicotine, alcohol, herbal joint, adderall, buspirone, xanax, acid (too much, it told me to stop but I kept going), and I've IVd heroin once although I kept fucking up and didn't really get much in. Probably some shit I'm forgetting but IDK. Anyways, I don't have any physical addictions, aside from maybe mild nicotine. Obviously this abuse leads to some problems. My main concern is money (I desperately need to save up more than I have now), but I also believe that the acid led to symptoms of paranoia, my brain feels less effective than it did before, I'm neglecting school it's damaged relationships and ruined one for me, and I just feel out of control around substances. For example, I'll get some of my mom's weed and take a bit. Okay, fine moderation. Cut to a few days later and it's almost all gone. This has happened multiple times just with weed, but I'm concerned about the things I currently have in possession. I'm saving them for times like parties and whatnot, and I tend to (have to) buy in large quantities, but I really just struggle with using them as soon as possible.

Anyways, I'm wondering if there are online communities or people who I can utilize instead of using substances. I don't really identify with things like AA or rehab, or religion and other more common aspects of sobriety. I'm just looking for someone who won't judge, and will help me stay clean when I want to be. Because, I feel stupid calling what I'm doing sobriety in any sense.

TL;DR: I can't commit to any full sobriety right now, but I want to mitigate the harm of my behavior, ideally with indefinite sobriety until I feel like I can use positively again. I mostly struggle with lack of control around substances, and just using them until they're gone, which has obviously brought up problems. I'm looking for people or communities who won't judge and who will help me stay sober and let me talk with them instead of using, just listening or giving advice or helping me distract myself. Like a sponsor, but independent from AA or any programs because I don't feel like my goals fit in with those. Thank you for reading!""

I‚Äôm a few days in and I‚Äôm really not feeling well at all. No convulsions and I‚Äôm able to sleep a little so that‚Äôs a plus. Overall just feeling terrible. But I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs considered too fast of a taper? Or am I on the right track. Thanks everyone",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8479115}"

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask... Please help.,"I decided to stop a relatively mild H habit, it was daily and did last around 2-3 months, maybe a bit longer. I have Suboxone and used it for the first 5 days of withdrawal, as sparingly as I could although on the first few days I was taking up to 8mg. I also used clonazepam a few times recently and I‚Äôve been stupid enough to use it too frequently an spark benzo withdrawal (I THINK, as I‚Äôm now very sensitive to benzo‚Äôs as I‚Äôve been through withdrawal several times with this substance before). I stopped taking the subs around day 5-6 of the last H use, and felt awfully anxious and unwell for 3 days until deciding to take a tiny amount of subs (about 1mg), it made me feel well enough to attend work and it lasted almost 12 hours until I started today feel unbearably anxious again. 

My questions:

1. Am I experiencing benzo withdrawal and I‚Äôm easing the symptoms with suboxone? Or am I experiencing the tail end of an opiate withdrawal combined with a benzo withdrawal? I really cannot tell.

2. Suboxone should make me well for at least a day, to my knowledge at least. So why after 12 hours do I immediately begin to feel awful? This is day 3 using small amounts of subs to get me through the day an it has worked everyday. The unbearable anxiety subsides after about an hour of waiting in bed for it to leave. 

3. I‚Äôm terrified of a drawn out Suboxone withdrawal as this is something I have never experienced and never want to. How fucked am I currently and how long can I keep this up until the subs are a new problem? 

4. I‚Äôm fairly uneducated regarding the more detailed aspects of subs, is it possible that I‚Äôm not having benzo withdrawal at all and that when stopping the subs after 5 days it‚Äôs normal to feel absolutely terrible for another 3? Am I withdrawing from subs already and putting off the inevitable but just not knowing it?

I really thought subs would help me kick the H, which they did. However, now I‚Äôm seriously struggling and I‚Äôm really confused as to what I‚Äôm experiencing. I welcome and appreciate any and all advice.

Before I go on about my dilemma I just want to say I have so much respect for you all and your recovery. I am not an opioid addict myself but I see you and i‚Äôm proud! 

My sister, however, is an opioid addict. She almost got to her year mark but relapsed and seems to be actively using again. She told our mom first and then weeks later told me. A friend of mine who is big on NA/AA meetings has never stopped checking in on her apparently, and my sister said she has now gone to two meetings with her since telling me. Unfortunately, Whether she is in fact going to meetings or not my mom and I are pretty sure she‚Äôs on something again.. she‚Äôs out all the time with old friends, and she‚Äôs staying out late. (This info is all through our mom who my sister lives with).  We think she‚Äôs mixing with her suboxon or possibly even dabbling in meth...
So my question is, wtf do we do? My mom says she has asked her a few times if she‚Äôs using and she says ‚Äúno‚Äù and denies it, but there‚Äôs a clear difference between her sober self and how she is behaving now... it‚Äôs not quite like it was before but it‚Äôs definitely off.

I have a great job now. I'm in general much happier than I was on drugs since I decided to quit. But life is hard and I forgot that life can be so hard. When things are going rough in a day it's like all I think about are drugs. My most recent addiction was benzedrex. But before that it was opiates on and off for about 10 years since I was 13. But I just don't know how to handle work stress while sober. I can't rly afford rehab rn even tho I'd love to do outpatient. That'd be a dream come true for me honestly. But rn it's not on the table bc of money. The things that stress me out the most is work. My back pain. And my toxic family that I have no choice but to live with. My family treats me like a child and monitors my every step even tho from a logistical standpoint I am independent. I know they mean well and just can't trust me right now but it just stresses me out so much and makes me feel like my progress means nothing to them. They have always been physically and psychologically abusive my whole life. Work stresses me out but the main thing that did that was the commute. Which has ended since we've started a project close to home but will be back in a year.

 I love the job itself. The work itself. But sometimes bc of the paperwork and my shit memory I get in trouble for messing up my paperwork. Yesterday I was almost fired cause I accidentally put the wrong time on my Timesheet and they accused me of stealing time. It was a half hour extra I put on accident. Why would I risk my job for 6 dollars? I've never in my life stole time. And had to beg for my job bc of this. Before that. My boss loved me. But since that mess up he doesn't trust me but gave me a Chance to prove myself. Which I'm taking gladly and have worked harder since then. But things like this make me crave opiates like there's no tomorrow and have almost made me relapse on benzedrex. That shit is so easily available and relapsing is very easy to do on it which sucks cause that was the most damaging substance I've ever taken. But I constantly want opiates even though I don't want them. I try to keep myself busy outside of work but find it hard to enjoy things like playing games and reading. I considered buying Lego sets to build as I loved doing that as a kid and they look cool asf. But they're SOOOO expensive lol.

I just need help or tips from you guys on how I can better handle these stressful situations. I don't wanna lose my sobriety.

I'll never forget because 1. I found this subreddit and I remember I had created a post stating how excited I was to finally be clean after beginning an outpatient program and my first time on Subs, and i'M excited for my future and what's to come. Someone had commented telling me congratulations but to not get to ahead of myself and take it one day at time. I remember thinking like Fck you why would you try to ruin my excitement. She was right. I relapsed after one month ""once I got better"". I took one pill, I said you know what one day won't hurt, I got this, I got control over this. That one day turned into fuck it another day won't hurt. Next thing you know im back into the shit hole I was once in. And it takes me back to that one comment that that woman left me in my post. She was completely right.

Well im one month ""sober"" again. And I say sober that way because im currently on Suboxone and I know how a lot of you guys feel about Suboxone in this Subb. and I completely understand. But you know what I am taking it one day at a time and Suboxone truly is helping me. I purposely ruined all my connections to my connects because I knew I won't be able to go back. Basically since I was a top buyer and it was every day spending $250+ ,  my dealers always trusted me. When I said I'll pay back double for loaning me drugs, ill do exactly that. So November 2nd I went and ""bought"" 40 percocets from my main dealer. FYI: my main dealer he runs the block, so he has 5 people who sell for him. Now these 5 people know that I wire him electronically the money and I stopped paying cash 3 years ago. So I did what I always did, I picked up what I wanted and went home, except this time I never paid him back. He doesn't know where I live and he'll never come looking for me because he knows my family is ""blue"" (law enforcement). So I burned that bridge so I won't ever go back. Yes I can definitely find another dealer but I wake up and look at how my life currently is today. My bills are all paid. My bank account has a whole week remaining the same. I am able to spend money on my nails. If I walk by a store and I see something I like, I can actually purchase it. When you're using, you can't do none of those things because that $30 manicure can be used for a blue 30 instead. So even tho I am on Suboxone, I am re-building my life slowly, I don't want to use Suboxone Long term for sure Because of the WD part. But Its definitely helping me get used to not being on Percocet. I had so many habits that all of a sudden I had to change now being on subs. For EX. I wake up, I think, how many pills I have? 2 hrs later, OK I can't go somewhere until I go buy some more pills. I can't eat unless I have pills. I can't have sex unless I have pills. So now Im training my brain and routine to be without this pill. And Suboxone is helping my mind calm down while I build Rome back up.

I started tapering a few months ago from quite a lot of codeine, I was doing 2 boxes of Nurofen + a day like a fucking idiot.

I‚Äôve done a fairly quick taper off the past few months and for the past few days I‚Äôve been taking 7.8mg DHC and 16MG codeine stable.

I felt like I was finally at a point to quit. I so desperately want freed from this prison. I hate my life everyday, I have horrible suicidal thoughts.
I got into outpatient treatment. One group a week, one one on one a week. Did good for a bit, but still failed. 
I got put on subs, I take 1mg (8th of a strip) when I don't have percs. 

I keep relapsing because of the physical pain I'm in. Mentally I'm at the point I want to be done, but then I can't handle my physical pain. I have pain in my back.. And I also have the most excruciating pain I've ever felt in my life inside my nostril and it goes from there through my cheek and ear. It wakes me up. Nothing helps at all other than snorting another perc. Literally nothing takes any of the pain away. I can't sleep. If i did a p and fall asleep as soon as it wears off I wake up and I just cry. 
I'm currently waiting on an ENT appt. I've been waiting 3 weeks and have 2 more weeks to go. I'm hoping they can help because I really want to be done. 

I am such a failure. I have the desire, but keep giving in to relieve the pain and feel okay. I'm so overwhelmingly depressed and disappointed in myself. 
And the fucked up thing is .. I caused this pain with my use.. And the ps are the only thing that takes it away. It's a vicious cycle.

2020-12-04 02:05:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/k6g08a/please_help/,Please Help,"I am an ex-opiate user. Did heroin for like 4 years, and then was on methadone & abstaining completely for 6 years. Stayed straight and honest, & never relapsed, somehow. I even quit smoking. I was at 95mgs at the highest, and tapered VERY slowly and carefully down to 10mgs before I jumped off this past Sunday (as in, my last dose was Sunday morning). I have completely abstained and feel no urge to use. I feel pretty crappy but it's tolerable in every way but one.

I can't fucking sleep. At all.

No, not the usual thrashing to sleep, getting only a couple hours or even a half hour at a time, etc. Come this morning, I will have not slept for even a minute for a full 72 hours. This is not an exaggeration and I have never been FULLY sleep deprived during any other time I was sick, be it from dope or from tapering methadone.

I am tired. It isn't simply insomnia, where you're like oh I'm up coz I'm sort of comatose but not sleepy. No, I am more exhausted mentally & physically than I've ever been in my entire life. I am awake because I get insanely brutal akathisia the moment I start to try to fall asleep. I have prescribed clonidine that has not been helping since day 1, have tried benadryl (& other OTC medications), have tried a hot shower, have had my partner give massages, put myself in total darkness & silence & comfort... and nothing. Nothing. Not even one of those black out blips in time. I have not had a wink of sleep, organic or passing out.

Timeline for symptoms in general was confusing, too.Day 1 (as in Monday, the day after my last dose) wasn't bad really at all, which was expected. Bit of... movement in my bowels. Feeling ""off"". I even slept on Monday evening, like a decent 6 or 7 hours.Day 2 I start feeling it. Pupils are huge. Hot/cold, goosebumps, some diarrhea, aches, leg cramps/etc. I am unable to sleep.Day 3 I am feeling as though I'm in full withdrawal. All the above plus immense anxiety. I am unable to sleep.Day 4 I feel the same as before, except I notice my pupils are no longer dilated somehow...? I feel I've been less susceptible to getting goosebumps or feeling excessive stimulus from normal things, too. Yet, at the same time, I started getting back ""twinges"" (I dunno what it is, maybe spasms, like random muscle pulling sensations). I have had these before and it isn't the end of the world. What does feel like the end of the world is that, once again, I am unable to sleep. Hence my being awake to type this out right now.

I'm scared and I am having a lot of trouble even writing this out. I cannot keep this up. I just want to sleep. I just want sleep. I can do this for sure, so easily, if I could just get even the smallest amount of rest. It's causing such anguish that I'm nearly suicidal. I cannot overstate the devastation this is making me feel.

Has this happened to anyone else?Can anyone give any words of encouragement rooted in experience (or otherwise)?Any recommendations overall?

I intend to go into the ER tomorrow morning. I live near the VCU hospital in VA, and have been told they have an intensive care unit for people like me. I refuse to go back on methadone. I have suffered enough that I just can't imagine giving up now. It'd be the only thing worst than going through this - going through it for no reason. I'll be fine if they just sedate me for a night's sleep. That's all I need. So long as they don't use opiates to do it, of course. But will they actually do it? Or will I be turned away, or given meds that don't work. I am getting to the point where I'm seeing things and I am really afraid of this going on any longer. I cannot, absolutely fucking cannot, keep doing this.

Any posts would be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE 12/7/2020:Hey again.

I did go in-patient, but never got past the ER section. If you are ever in my situation, please just get back on methadone and try again. Two reasons for that.

First, the environment you end up stuck in does not facilitate any sort of help, or frankly even care. They did NOT treat it with the urgency that was needed. They figured I wouldn't die, and that's it. They gave me meds, but only  Hydroxyzine, which is essentially a stronger Benedryl I've come to find. It did absolutely nothing. They let you lie down, but only on very cold, very hard mattress type things that don't get any warmer or more comfortable, no matter what you do. The place is noisy, they don't allow you to use earplugs (I brought my own, they still said no), and you can turn off the light in the room but it isn't completely dark coz the hall light is constantly on, of course. t was not much different from my experience in jail. At least in jail you can get warm in bed, too... though they don't bother with medicine at all. Not that it worked, but still. The people, luckily, were very kind. I imagine I was simply misunderstood and not taken seriously enough as a patient, is all. I can't imagine my case is common, so I'm not faulting the people... the system though, maybe, yeah. They almost got a court order to keep me in, coz I was obviously stressed to the point of being completely out of it once I was not only given meds that did nothing, but blatantly told that was all they could do for me, at least at that time. Basically, more time would have to pass... like hours, perhaps another day, who knows? Too long. Luckily, I was allowed to leave eventually. Just barely. I was horrified that I may have been stuck there, in perpetual torture, when I could make it all go away and start again with a better plan if they just let me go home and immediately take my meds & sleep. Crazy stuff.

The second thing is that, as it turns out, the longer I went without sleeping, the less likely it was I'd be able to sleep. Come to find, your brain only repairs receptor functioning during NREM sleep. As this is the process of going from withdrawal to being normal, you actually NEED sleep to be able to get out of withdrawal. It seems that you can either be awake or in repair mode, but it is NOT simultaneous. This means you cannot simply push through the situation I was in - you will only be torturing yourself. Here's some info on the subject...: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651462/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651462/)

I ultimately went 80 hours before continuing on 10mg methadone. Been daily dosing as prescribed since I got out of the ER at Tucker Pavilion around noon last Friday.

This morning during an appointment about all this, my methadone doctor said no sleep was not normal, and especially not for that long, so he suspects ""it isn't the methadone"". Thing is, I never had this issue before, be it on taper or from IV heroin withdrawal. Difficulty sleeping, for sure, but never no sleep at all. I am likely genetically set up to be crappy with sleep already, and this just exacerbated the issue and caused a new, unforeseen complication in my complete cessation of sleep. That's my understanding. Not that I was taken too seriously, unfortunately.

The doctor also immediately and sternly said ""yes you did"" when I said I didn't sleep for 80 hours. He claimed I would be dead. It really irritated me, coz I get people exaggerate, but I am 100% sure I didn't nod out at any point. Perhaps microsleeps, which only last from a second to half a minute at most, but that is NOT actual sleeping, & you'd think he would know as much. I don't mean to sound dramatic or short, but it really bothered me that he was so dismissive. I have 6 years under my belt, never relapsing even once since starting methadone, and so being treated as a liar or at least exaggerating when I am a perfect patient (veritably so, on record) & am 100% certain of the hell I went through, was frustrating. I didn't bother arguing, even though he's objectively wrong (there are clear accounts of people going longer than I did, in fact the record is like 11 days, so I dunno wtf he's on about & why he had to act so rude and dismissive about it). But I digress...

The methadone doctor did not give me a game plan. Just said ok, 10mg as usual. I asked if I should taper more, and he said it won't make a difference with how low it already is. Also weird. Immediately after, the head nurse blatantly told me she disagreed and did believe me even though she'd never seen this happen before. She said she's no doctor, but she believes I can get through this still, just with some tweaks. She recommended I do continue to taper, and also recommended Trazodone the next time I try to get off completely - taken at night only. They can't prescribe it there, so I have gone ahead and started to make an appointment with my psych doctor (they're calling me back at 4:30).

This whole experience has been pretty brutal. I do feel so, so much better now, though. The other symptoms are total cake in comparison to not sleeping whatsoever. I really really do get why it's used as a form of torture. It is officially the worst psychological assault I've ever endured by a long shot. I don't know how I survived it.

Anyway, I'm going with the plan that is taper, 2mg at a time, until I get my prescription for Trazodone (hopefully) and trying again with that.

From my understanding, Trazodone is VERY unique in that it isn't a narcotic, isn't at all addictive, and does NOT cause RLS as a side-effect (might actually relieve it, in fact). I am extremely hopeful as every account I see says it DEFINITELY works - without fail - as a sleep aid. If anyone here has any experience with it, let me know...? I'd greatly appreciate it.

I figure if that doesn't work, we can try benzodiazepines  (really not trying to go there, but meh... luckily I don't have any addiction in relation to them and don't enjoy when I've been prescribed them before, at least), or perhaps switching to Suboxone? If all that doesn't work, then there is probably something else going on, but I very much doubt it. We'll see.  


It's worth mentioning that I never once thought of using illicit drugs. I am very lucky to be far enough along in my recovery that anything of that sort isn't even part of the equation anymore. My concern is sleep, and I am 100% sure that I will succeed at getting off of methadone if I can simply sleep even a little bit during the acute withdrawal stage!

After the first couple years of sobriety, my cravings dropped to about a 3 on a scale of **100**.  Been slowly dropping ever since, and I honestly can't remember what year it was that I had a legit *craving*. 

Well, early last week my 17 year old daughter had her wisdom teeth taken out, so of course the doctor wrote her a prescription for a small amount of Norco (20, I think).  Her pain was never too bad, so she only wound up taking 2 of them.

My wife and I locked the rest up in our safe in case our daughter got a dry socket over the past week, or something, while she healed.  My wife asked me, ""Are you going to be OK with that?""  (Like, would I be tempted?)

I told her no, which is the absolute truth.  I have not once considered taking one of those pills.  The only reason I'm thinking about the subject right now is that I walked by our medicine safe, saw that my wife forgot to lock it, and thought, huh. I haven't even bothered to think about it.  I locked the safe and went about my morning.

So my point is...

You can and will TOTALLY RECOVER.  You will beat this.  You will be FREE.  Once you have enough sobriety, your rational brain can take full control of your faculties and you can CHOOSE never to be an addict again.

It is not my habit ever to criticize the path to recovery that some folks take, but I'd like you to please discard the false and damaging notion that you will always be ""powerless"" in the face of addiction.

Hope everyone is doing well and soldiering through, just thought I'd do my monthly post and try to encourage those struggling to keep pushing. 

I am about a year and a half clean from a heroin addiction. 

If anyone read my previous post, I was stabbed 9 times about a month ago, and was put in hospital for a week where  I received minimal opiates to help the pain. 

Since leaving hospital, no more opiates were taken and I soldiered through the pain. Ever since getting stabbed the idea of using or even just the thoughts of my past have essentially been non existent. Something about the whole experience just put everything in perspective almost instantaneously and things have been incredibly easy. 

I honestly feel like that chapter in my life is over. Hoping nothing pops back up in the future but over the last year and a half I have done a lot to separate myself from who I used to be. 


To those wondering, I was stabbed for my mobile phone in a McDonald's waiting bay on my girlfriends birthday when I went to go get some Ice Cream. This was in Australia.

So I‚Äôm a year into a habit after having Broken my neck and back in a diving accident. Recovered from that and tore my ACL skiing two months later. Got put on painkillers which turned into Roxies and fake Roxies.  The last four months my habit was 15 30s a day.  A lot...  

I really wish I could have tapered but I was truly fed up with the life.  So I bought some methadone from a friend. I have some phenibut and a little gabapentin (21 300 mg pills).  My doctor prescribe me some trazodone for sleep. I have another virtual appointment with him in the morning and will try to get some more gabapentin or lyrica and maybe a muscle relaxer and clonidine.  I feel like that is a longshot but I will be honest with him and explain I know the risks and only ask for a 10 or 14 day supply.  I have a lot of kratom (trainwreck  strain), And both liquid extract shots and some of the OPMS Gold extract pills.  

I snorted 2 Roxies at 6 pm yesterday.  Woke up with a terrible wrenching backache at midnight. Where i would usually take some more oxy I instead took 70 mg of methadone.  On top of that I have been taking super B complex, magnesium, zinc, calcium, super doses of liposomal vitamin C and DLPA the last few days.  I will continue the vitamins for the next three weeks or more. Vitamin C for only five days.  The methadone carried me pretty well til 4 pm today.  I started feeling discomfort in my back especially and took 500 mg phenibut (my first time) which did wonders.  I know not to do this longer than a few days.  

I plan on tapering off methadone the next five days. Taking Phenibut and gabapentin if needed.     

Can anyone tell me if alternating these two will stave off wds from those?  

After day five of tapering from Methadone I plan on using kratom if needed. I imagine I will need some thing.

Life is slowly bring me its sober rewards. I am trusting the process, working a program (most of the time) and just trying to manage my way through this path called sober life. I still got a lot of doubts regarding alcohol, weed and so on, but as I get more and more clean days, just turning this shit into a lifestyle gets more and more appealing. All I know right now is, that just for today, I wont do any more opis or other drugs. 

Lurking this sub has been a huge help for me. Just to resonate with other people in the same situation has been amazing. Of course NA is great, but it's a bit more umbrella-like. Looking at other people who know how addictive that heavenly nod is, is something else. So from me to you, thank you. Have a great december.",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.76989377}"

Yesterday I took maybe .4-5mg of bupe in the morning smoked a half g of black and stopped smoking black at 4pm

This morning I didn't take anything. I waited as long as I could... about 11am which is like 20 hours since smoking any black. Felt pretty horrible. Then I took 1.5mg of bupe  
Felt pretty shitty so I jolted to a friend who gave me some black  
Between then and now I've been taking .25mg of bupe, waited to feel weird, then smoked some black to balance it out, rinse and repeat every hour or couple hours...

I've taken a total of 4mg of bupe today and I've been smoking small amounts of black along side it. 

I'm feeling pretty damn decent. Definitely not high.

Did I just invent some weird hyper-bernese induction method? I feel like the microdoses I took a few days ago introduced it to my system. The 20 hour abstinence allowed the full-agonist heroin to start releasing from my u-opioid receptors, then I just took 1.5mg of bupe to start filling them back up. The receptors that weren't taken by the relatively low amount of bupe got plugged up by the black... Tomorrow I plan on taking a full 2mg in the morning. Will be interesting to see if I get thrown into PWD, but with almost 6mg of bupe built up in my body, I gotta imagine there's not a ton of black left to ""rip off"" the receptors to throw me into PWD.

I am so determined to get over this awful awful 8 month relapse. It's been the worst of my life by far. I've done more shady things this relapse than I ever would have imagined I was capable of. I just can't go into full withdrawals so this is the plan I've come up with. Slowly increase bupe levels, while decreasing smoking black.

Will I get my motivation and want to live life again back? Will it be this way for months? It‚Äôs shitty and the cravings are still bad every day.

Fucked up my taper üòî

I fucked up, as usual. I‚Äôve been doing a rapid taper to get off of PST and I‚Äôve been pretty much just not leaving the house and dying of boredom. Yesterday I had to get my phone reset at the apple store and, well, I was a few minutes away from a store with poppy seeds. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt do it but I did. I didn‚Äôt get much out of it since the subs blocked most of it. Felt it a little bit but I still feel like a jackass. I was really depressed yesterday after I did it. I feel like a total loser. I‚Äôm 31 years old and have been through rehab after rehab, kick after kick in my life. 

I can‚Äôt even trust myself to leave my house. Am I supposed to be a shut in recluse? I don‚Äôt know how much it will affect my taper, as I said, since the bupe blocked most of it. I had been on 3 mg, going down steadily from 16 around a couple of weeks ago.

I feel demoralized. What am I supposed to do? I have comorbidities and can‚Äôt risk getting COVID. Being stuck at home has been terrible but after being stuck at home for so long, then trying to taper, planning to kick, and wanting to get and stay clean have been so hard. I feel so bad about myself lately. I‚Äôve been drinking like a fish, too. I wish I could go to a program or something to get a head start but I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that with the pandemic...

I‚Äôm tired of looking in the mirror and feeling nothing but dissatisfaction and self loathing.

I‚Äôm really struggling here. I‚Äôm considering getting vivitrol. The last few years I feel like a perpetual loser. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I wish I could go somewhere for four weeks so bad right now... but it‚Äôs not going to happen... I want to kick after Christmas or around New Years. That‚Äôs the plan at least. I‚Äôm usually pretty good about sticking it through the kick itself... I just want to be someone that I‚Äôm proud of and not a constantly sick, in PAWS, or hungover loser.",1,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.94468063}"

But enough to have me running like hell to my dboy to fix me up.

I have a plan to try this again. I have Subutex now (which isn't much different I know) that I am going to try at the 15 hour mark. It's about this time that I normally will be in withdrawls and cave and get some dope. I smoked about a g on sat, a g on sunday and half a g today. I've been using daily (although not nearly this much, closer to .5g a day) for 7-8 months.

I smoked the last of my stuff an hour ago, and plan on taking a bit of xanax to get me through the night. I have 4x 8mg subutex and 3x 8mg suboxone which I plan on using to taper with over the days ahead. My hope is that I'll use the partial agonist while the crap clears out of my body and I ditch the ""rush"" of picking up the hard stuff. So hopefully these 7 pills will last me a week, and then I have a very small amount of gabapentin and muscle relaxers to come off the subs.
