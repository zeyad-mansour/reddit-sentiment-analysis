Quit for about a month, then smoked for a weekend. Beat myself up over it and then stayed quit. About a month and a half after my second quit started, I took my drug test. Turns out that they didn’t even test for thc! But I’m really grateful that I went that time to pass “the right way” because I learned how much easier life was becoming. I’m at 73 days after that weekend and my house is clean, I’m two pant sizes down, I’m happy, and I’m a lot smarter and focused than I thought. I’m also 136 days sober off of alcohol. 

Just thinking about how blessed I am and wanted to share this as a word of encouragement. Do I still get cravings? Absolutely! But the positives keep me from caving. It was really hard to stay off the pot in the beginning. And smelling wisps of smoke come in from outside when my bf smokes still makes my mouth water. But dang y’all, life is just easy now

This isn't my first time trying to quit and I know how miserable withdrawals can be. For me, the worst part is not being able to sleep and the excessive night sweats.

I started out using weed very sporadically mainly with friends or as way to relax and unwind. Then I moved in with a daily smoker and jumped on the bandwagon. Of course I was under the impression that weed wasn't really addictive (especially since I had been able to moderate my use back then) but then I suddenly started realizing how difficult it was to be without it.

Now I've been smoking daily for the last 4 years and am truly at a point where I can't keep doing it. Pretty much if I'm not at work, I'm getting high which leads to nothing productive. I can spend an entire weekend locked in my apartment smoking every waking hour and be totally content with that but I don't want to be content with it anymore.

In an ideal world, I'd be able to moderate my use and be able to consume how I did before I started using everyday. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to be the case, at least not for a very long while. It's been a year since my old roommate and I moved out of our place, and I thought that it would be easier to quit once we weren't living together anymore, but truthfully I've made very feeble attempts in this time.

I'm ready to put this behind me. Last night I put whatever weed I had left and rolling papers in a bag, wrote ""FREE WEED"" on it, and put it at a bus stop by my apartment for someone else to enjoy. I threw out any cartridges I had left and locked up my piece and grinder in a K-safe to keep only to give to my dad (who is able to safely consume and moderate) next time I see him.

This is it! Here's to hoping I can be successful in reaching the 30 day mark for my 30th birthday! Best of luck to everyone on this journey :)",1,0

I’m typically a Reddit lurker but after coming across this feed  I couldn’t help but share my story and ask for insight. I apologize in advance for the long post. 
My experience with cannabis is a bit different than most. 

I am a life-long migraine sufferer. A few years back the migraines became chronic, daily, and debilitating. A non traditional doctor recommended I try medicinal cannabis. I was introduced to the medicinal cannabis concentrates at dispensaries and thought I found the solution to my migraines. For the first several months the concentrates would provide plenty relief. 

However, month by month the relief from the concentrates became less and my addiction to marijuana became more. I was no longer only using the concentrates for migraines and became dependent on it to eat, manage my anxiety and depression , and function daily. All that was left was a migraine sufferer with an addiction to cannabis and a hollowed version of the person I was before. 

Now years later a study has come out linking medical cannabis use for migraines to medication overuse headaches, which is a vicious cycle of getting a migraine, then using medication for short term relief (in my instance cannabis), and then being left with a rebound headache. I thought to myself could this be the cause of these debilitating migraines continuing for so long. After reading this article last week I immediately stopped using cannabis and the first week off cannabis was one of the hardest things I’ve done in my life. The pain and emotional distress was intense. 

Now on my 8th day into cutting out cannabis “cold turkey” I am passed the stage of itching to get high, which is a relief. However, I am having extreme mood swings, amplified by the migraines. I never used to react with physical anger to the head pain but this past week I get extremely angry and end up punching holes in the wall or screaming into a pillow until my voice is hoarse and I’m starting to worry myself. Are these mood swings common with withdrawal and for how long? And what are some techniques that have worked for you all to alleviate these mood swings? I love to exercise but exercise is not an option currently  because any strenuous physical activity triggers an even more severe migraine. 

Best wishes and thank you to those who took the time to read my story",3,0

I honestly don't feel any better now than I did two weeks ago, my back pain is roaring back, and my anxiety is still heaving prevalent, it just isn't set off with marijane. 

IDK, this week has been a tough one thus far. I'm also in a pretty low place considering the current state of the world/society and the trajectory we are heading. Honestly, the old me would be wanting to get high, but the new me knows that won't change a damn thing about anything really, besides taking away from more money I should be saving. 

I must say, the only thing that I do notice is that I am sleeping a lot more and I honestly feel more physically tired than I was on weed, which contradicts what most of what everyone else says.",4,0

I mean, I still feel shitty about a handfull of things about myself, but now that I'm not smoking and clear-headed, I feel like I can handle stress better on my own and have more energy and more  motivation to do more with my life. 

To me, I feel like I've spent my last 6+ years wasting my life playing video games and getting high (24 yrs old now). Video games and pot my be entertaining, but they gain me absolutely nothing in the long run. Never graduated high school, never got my license, never took a lot of opportunities I should have throughout the years. 

Now I see that (for me anyway), motivation depends on how badly I really want to better my life. Self-confidence (for me) doesn't just come out of nowhere, it is something I have to build up from hard work and trail and error. Hard work is what it is, don't try to find a way around it. Work through it and you'll feel much better about yourself. 

After a few weeks went by and I could sleep without the aid of pot, I realized everythings a process, and not to be impatient about the way things are in my life currently. Everyday I will improve bit by bit, I just need to keep trying my best to progress forward's and not take any steps backwards.

Thinking about what food I might have is making me dry heave to the extent that I have tears in my eyes. Even a sip of water seems to piss off my stomach. 

I'm fully expecting a rancid night of insomnia, but I'm even more apprehensive about just how severe the nausea/CHS is going to be tomorrow. It always seems to be worst first thing in the morning.

What are the best anti-nausea remedies that have worked for you? I didn't find that ginger tea did me any favours. Chewing gum seems to help somewhat. There's something about how the menthol overpowers my throat which provides short term relief to my overactive gag reflex, but it doesn't do anything to the actual nausea.

Each time I would wake up in the same position I was in real life (in my living room). When I was officialy awake, for the first 15 secondes, I didn't trust reality. Am I still dreaming? That was the craziest thing that happened to me regarding dreaming. It was so real. Usually I know when I'm dreaming. Did any of you guys experienced something like that? That was a scene from the movie Inception for real.",3,0

I have tried so many times to quit, but I feel like I always end up crawling back. I hate this feeling. All I feel when I wake up in the morning is regret, but as the day goes on that regret fades away and I start craving.

I can't seem to quit when I really need to. I have been struggling in school for a while now but I just can't get on top of my work because I'm always getting high. Last night I completely missed the deadline for a quiz because I thought it was a good idea to get high right after class. Now I have probably already ruined my chances at an A in a class that I should be doing really well in. I had so much time to get ahead on the quiz, but instead I spent that time getting high and procrastinating.

I am graduating soon and I have no idea what to do in the real world. I have no internship, no experience, no offers, and no motivation besides the paralyzing fear of failure. What have I done with my life the past three years? I can hardly remember most of college. 

I don't feel like this is a productive post, but I just needed to vent about some of my frustrations. Quitting is so hard, especially when my roommates and friends are all stoners. I have failed countless times and I feel like a complete failure for letting weed control my life. It's all I think about all day, instead of my future or wellbeing. My family thinks I'm a successful, well-adjusted student, but in reality I'm a lazy, unhealthy, and uninterested loser.

Had quit once for 3 odd months before but this time I quit it for good.

I had taken some loans to get baked and had to sell my PS4 to pay them off. Gaming was the only thing that kept me going after a hard shift at work in the last few days but this was a loan I couldn’t put off for another day so had to make this decision. It was the first one thing I ever bought with my salary and it was really difficult to let go of it but sigh, life is like that sometimes I think. 

Guess that’s penance served for abusing the devil’s lettuce. Feeling really low today but I’m glad I’m debt free and I’m still sober.

Why on Earth do I continue to smoke, when the best I've felt has been while sober? Right now I could be 3 months sober, if I didn't give weed that one more chance that led me onto buying more, and back to the cycle. I know it isn't that hard to be sober for a day, but it's just tempting to smoke for some reason.

***""Maybe it'll be different this time""*** No it won't. I barely even remember what I have done the past week of being high. Well, to be fair I have not done much of anything except eat sugary carbs and sit on the pc literally doing nothing. Feeling bored, I keep refreshing youtube in search for something, until I feel like smoking again. No matter how much I smoked, I'd want more in 2-3 hours (my tolerance isn't super high).

 Every good thing in my life, my habits and routines, all come crashing down rather quickly when I hop on the weed again. It's hard to keep your head straight. In my experience, you tend to only look for the short-term ""rewards"" and ignore the painful things. Rewards being weed, sugar, take-out, p\*rn, entertainment.

While those things are highly pleasurable short-term, they leave me personally feeling empty inside and I always crave for more the next day. Chasing high in every moment makes satisfaction flee ever faster and seem more distant.

I don't really completely understand what weed gives to me. Maybe my body has learned, that by smoking, I enter a state of being highly ""alive"", *for a moment.* But I'm actually really upset and angry with myself for ruining my health and wasting money. I would smoke and 2 minutes in be regretting it.

&#x200B;

What the fuck, I don't want to live like this for another 6 years my God... I'm not in school, I don't have a job, I'm trying to recover my mental health to be able to go to school and work, but weed addiction isn't really helping.

Deliver me away from this bs, I hope one day when I have a streak going on sober I realise that a single hit relapse can lead me to 2 months of addiction again. One day I'll learn to trust sobriety, and my instincts about weed. The anxiety is alarm bells ringing, maybe it's time to listen.",94,0

I have flirted with this day for 8 years, ever since I started using weed as a comfort in my withdrawal after abusing prescription medication.

I had an Aha! moment 4 years ago when I was forced to stop using weed after getting into legal trouble for other drugs: after 14 days of withdrawal anxiety and sweats, I woke up in the morning with no anxiety or ""mood"" for the first time in years. I was the best version of myself that year I was not allowed to use drugs.

I chose to get involved with another drug about a year ago and quit that just under 3 months ago. In the meantime, I've been leaning into weed for comfort and that habit is not working for me.

The subtlety of weed is a good trick. I used my own mind to learn how to get high and now I am pitted against myself in the disassembly of that learning. Well, I am ready to part ways with that aspect of myself to allow room for other aspects to experience life.

I saw alot of people I used to see there when I still smoked. Had a talk with them, and surprise. They all talk the same talk and weren’t surprised when I said I hadn’t smoked for 4 months. They just gave me a impression that they were a bit depressed or something.

My interviews went so well the owner of the job I turned down said to call him any time and he would find a place for me. Which is not a thing most owners would say to a person with zero experience.

What an emotional roller-coaster it's been so far but we have gotten further than we have in other recent attempts to quit. 

I haven't posted here before because I was ashamed of all the day 1's or less-than-a-week's of failed attempts. There was always some kind of excuse like a birthday or friends coming over but mainly just stress and self medicating to try to take that away. With the both of us hooked it was even harder, when one of us would cave so did the other.

We had all the odds stacked against us and this is why we kept doing it for so long so we didn't have to face the hard stuff. Seriously it has been the most testing time of my life and relationship mostly due to covid as it has compromised so many major life events.

We grew some plants and basically have smoked the whole pandemic away. When our stuff ran out chasing it became a chore, my partner driving for miles, me resorting to scoring off a random teenager  'friend of a friend'. Of course the money drained away too & just smoking at night crept into starting in the afternoon and even some wake and bake days.

I'm 41yo and have been on and off smoking weed in various forms since I was 15. I  changed from smoking a small joint mixed with herbal to chaffing multiple bongs with tobacco like I did when I was younger.

But guess what, you can't smoke like that all day every day when you have adult responsibilities and you can't smoke like that and have it not affect your mental health. My anxiety went through the roof, I was reactive and couldn't deal with even minor upsets, I was yelling at my kid, being offended & defensive towards my partner, we were arguing daily and it was looking like our relationship wasn't going to last.

This was the turning point we needed. 

So now I'm feeling good after a few badly slept nights in a pool of my own sweat, I'm waking up without a foggy stone-over, my anxiety has calmed and I can deal with shit a bit better, my lungs are repairing although I'm having a cigarette if I really need something to get me through.

The grounded app tells me that my quit journey is now 'complete' - but I realise now  that's just not true.

I used to always smoke when I was watching TV (usually anime) and playing video games and to start with those were huge triggers. When I actually started being able to enjoy those things without weed it was such a huge moment because every time I'd tried to quit before they'd just felt hollow and empty without it. I'd never managed to make it to this point before.

Last night I decided to rewatch an anime I haven't seen in years. I only managed one episode before I had to turn it off. There was such strong nostalgia associated with it, and with smoking, that it brought on massively strong cravings. I haven't felt them that strong since the first couple of weeks. I could remember exactly what grinder I had at the time, which pipe (I'd just given up smoking tobacco back then) what munchies I had, how the sofa in my old flat felt. But worst of all was remembering how good it used to feel, back before I did it every day. When it was still enjoyable.

I made it through the evening with a glass of wine and a good cry, but it made me realise that those six weeks that I'm so proud of are nothing in the grand scheme of things. Of course, they ARE something to be proud of, a few months ago six weeks would have seemed impossible - but I smoked weed for 18 years! It's nothing in comparison. Even the fact that I only smoked daily for the last 4, that's still 18 years of it being part of my identity, something that I did to unwind and that helped me connect with other people. Oh, you smoke? Me too. Let's hang out!

I think I'm still in mourning for that part of my life, before I became dependent and could enjoy weed the same way I enjoy alcohol - just now and then. Just because the THC has supposedly left my body doesn't mean that the memories and emotions have left my mind. I think it's a realisation that I needed to help me move on to the next phase. I'm still in the process, and will be for a long time I think.

I don't want this to come across as negative, or put anyone off trying to quit. The difference that I can see between myself six weeks ago and now is unbelievable. I have so much more motivation and I feel like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. My anxiety is down, I've been performing better at work, my house is tidier. I want to keep that going, and I think this experience has been helpful in the long run

Personally, I'm feeling SO much better.","As many of us know, the realities of long-term and heavy weed use often involve *opposite* effects of what we'd expect. Like many people, at first weed seemed brilliant--it boosted my mood and creativity, increased my appetite (great for me because I have trouble keeping on weight due to health issues), and reduced my pain.

  Fast forward to about 12 years later and my use was heavier than ever. I'd switched from flower to an incredibly concentrated vape that I would hit morning until night. Somehow I still believed that weed helped me, but when I started journaling how I felt on it, I found quite the opposite: it made me feel more anxious and depressed, ruined my appetite (to the point I was being extensively worked up by doctors), and destroyed my memory so much that I was diagnosed with amnesia.

  I'm a week in and, personally, have barely had withdrawal. Please don't call me ""lucky""; it doesn't mean anything has been easy, especially as a former medical user. But I think weed was actually doing such a number on my brain, that my dopamine levels must have been *so* low, that stopping has made me feel better in almost every way. 

  I can eat normally again, and my bipolar and PTSD symptoms are vastly improved. I feel like myself again! The only downside for me has been my PTSD nightmares/flashbacks coming back stronger than ever, but I'm dealing and hoping it lessens soon.

I started using it to “help” my anxiety and depression, but Its only made it worse. My logical brain understands that weed makes my problems worse, so why can’t I just stop? Why cant I just FUNCTION? I hate snapping at my family, i hate failing my classes, i hate ignoring my friends and ruining my relationships with people. I hate constantly having to lie to everyone around me. I hate constantly being paranoid of getting caught. I hate everything about it, so why do i keep fucking doing it? Every time I smoke, the smallest obstacles seem insurmountable. Even something basic like paying my phone bill, taking out the trash, taking a shower, seem as difficult as climbing mount Everest. I get so pessimistic and insecure. In school its even worse. The second an assignment presents or challenge, or something minor goes wrong, I feel stupid and just give up.

When I first started college I was able to wait until night to smoke and sometimes would skip days here and there. Fast forward a year I go through something traumatic away from home, with no friends or family. Weed was there. After that trauma I had to smoke all day, every day. I would skip class or show up to class high and smelling like weed. It was embarrassing but I didn’t know how to cope. Each time a therapist suggested quitting I would think they were insane. I had my dads voice in my head saying psych meds were bad and weed was good and natural. I still feel like I can’t tell him I’m quitting. Each time I do he reminds me how much it “helps” me. 

Weed has been my safety for so long. It has allowed me to stop crying and just numb myself to sleep. In my mind it’s prevented me from harming myself, but I could never know. I never used weed in a “healthy” way. 

I want to stop because frankly, I need to stop punishing my future self. I had a bright future that was derailed but today i can choose to get back on track.

I smoked this morning, but it’s late afternoon and I haven’t smoked. For me, that’s a huge accomplishment. This is day 1 for me. 

I’m terrified. I’m going to be hit with all of these emotions, all of which I haven’t learned healthy ways to live through. Thankfully I had therapy today, and it made me see how I do have some strength in me. I managed to clean more today than I have in months. That alone made me so happy. But I’m still getting urges. I don’t even know if I will make it through tonight but I’m going to try for me.

After being fully sober (went through therapy to get sober) for 3 months I started smoking weed again occasionally with friends. The golden rule being not to smoke w/o friends. This rule has worked for me the first 5 years that I smoked and for my friends it still works after 10 years.

However, the last few months have been rough. I got diagnosed with ADHD and my gf has been struggling increasingly with her anxiety and depression. My ADHD didn't come as a surprise but the reality of it has had quite an impact on my mind. Medication also adds a huge rebound in my restlessness once its effects wear off after work.

In July I messed up after a frustrating day, got myself a joint and lit it. Since that day it escalated, first few weeks it was one, maybe two per week. In August I was basically smoking daily again, all was lost. Last month I usually smoked one to three joints a day, fuck..... 

Now I've got to face reality and quit again, at least a month of pure hell. I hope that by actually writing this I can hold myself to it. End the cycle of feeling bad when I'm not stoned and feeling worse once I get stoned. 

I should be able to do it myself this time, right?! I know how it works and successfully got rid of the addiction last year. Idk what I need, but I hope this post helps. Thanks for making it this far through my misery :)",5,0

I am currently in a sober period hoping to keep it that way.

When I was in second grade, I had a concussion that gave me ADHD. I started taking medication for it up until 11th grade when I felt I know longer needed it (I was wrong and I realize that now). Looking back I did suffer my senior year because of it and now being in my junior year of college I realize I should've never stopped taking it in the first place. I will be going to get it re-prescribed soon.

My weed use began my senior year of high school and quickly progressed into addiction after graduating. For 3 years I was working a full time job living with my parents as I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life yet. For 3 years I smoked heavily. I knew my weed use was a problem before starting college but no matter how hard I tried and how much I didn't want to, I kept smoking. All day, everyday. This continued into college and my grades suffered because of it. I believe I was so drawn to weed because I was self-medicating my ADHD with it making up for my lack of natural dopamine.  I realize now that my brain is not the same as everyone else's, it is lacking something that I tried to fill with weed. 

Hopefully this can help someone else have the same realization and use that as a stepping stone to curb your addiction. Maybe you just need to be medicating with something a doctor prescribes.",6,0

I used to smoke every night (bong rips, blunts, joints) and on any non-work days, I'd smoke all day long. This was the case for me for about 5 years. Then came along some life events which made me get out of the house more, and coupled along with the first half of the pandemic (where everything shut down), I took a year long break. 

After things opened up, I justified my vices by allowing myself alcohol or weed. Chose weed, because alcohol tastes terrible anyways. My problem now is that I'm back to smoking at least one or two joints a week (and these are heavy joints, ones wrapped in kief, and oil, and all that stuff). I know that might not seem like a lot but I'd like to fully quit since whenever I'm high, life takes a pause. Smoking helps me satiate my cravings for around a week, but then the next week rolls around and I'm back to smoking a joint. The worst part is that, since my overall smoking amount has decreased, a joint will get me high for a whole day (while I convince myself that it's only gonna last a few hours). 

I'd love tips/advice for how to get over heavy strong cravings. My main problem too is that I'm in a legal state with a dispensary quite literally next door to me, so getting weed is never an issue. Oftentimes, I'll be driving home, and decide to pick up some on the way home simply because passing by the dispensary is enough to trigger my cravings. Once the cravings come, I tell myself, ""Ah it's just one joint"", ""You need it to relax"", etc, when in reality, I don't need any of those things to relax. I used to be able to do things productively, such as hobbies, but when I smoke, all I do nowadays is watch Youtube reruns and play games. I know that smoking does nothing for me. When I smoke, my hobbies take a pause, goals I'm working on take a pause, my workout progress takes a pause, and my social life takes a pause. It actively hinders me from my life's progress and I realize that. When the cravings come, I ignore these very reasonable thoughts. 

When I spend some time analyzing my thoughts, the only part of smoking that I really enjoy is honestly the action of lighting up, and those first few minutes of bliss before I turn into a zombie. The actual part of being high isn't enjoyable to me, it feels like I'm always chasing the high that I used to experience. I don't understand why I enjoy torturing myself. If I don't enjoy smoking anymore, why do I still do it? I had a recent smoke sesh where I essentially became super couch locked. I didn't enjoy it at all, and yet I decide to give in to my cravings on a weekly basis.

I know this is a semi-long post, and thanks in advance if you read this. I know smoking once/twice a week may not seem like a lot, but it's the final hump blocking me from achieving full sobriety.

TLDR: Used to smoke heavily almost every day, stopped for a year, now back to smoking 1 or 2 heavy joints/blunts a week (going on for almost 8 months now). How do I get past cravings?",2,1

Unfortunately though, it's almost October and I haven't been able to stay clean longer than two weeks at a time. Just when I'm starting to feel some clarity/happiness from staying sober, I fall right back into my habits again, which usually means smoking everyday for a month or longer at a time.

For context - i've been using daily for the past 7 years. I've made several attempts to stop altogether, relapsing each time but with slightly longer gaps in between each relapse. I am currently onto my second week, not counting the days exactly because it's an exercise that reminds me of the habit and the longer I go without reason to think about the smoke the better imo. 

Fasting has helped to accelerate my progress through and out of acute withdrawal symptoms. I base this on comparing past experiences of quitting while not fasting and I believe the result is due to how THC is stored in the body (in fat cells). When you enter the fasted state your body begins to break down and utilise the energy from fat cells. The longer you fast, the more fat cells get broken down, accelerating the depletion of your body's THC reserves and getting back to baseline faster. I've actually had nights where after fasting for 16 hours I began to feel slightly high in a very familiar way. But the most profound affect for me has been the reduction in night sweats and sleep disturbance. 

Weening while coming off it is another known way to reduce acute withdrawal, but this has not been an option for me as if I have it I will smoke it and I can't control my intake. Nevertheless it feels like fasting has enabled my body to ween off the drug organically and it's making the ride down to baseline a lot smoother and less physically traumatic. 

Has anyone else tried this or had similar experiences?",8,0

I am working a great job doing something I love. I keep a clean house and cook at home (most of the time). I am in a healthy relationship with a man I adore. I have been in therapy for over a year working on myself. I have lived an active lifestyle up until fairly recently because I am pregnant with a baby girl! Most of all I am happy to say I am proud of the person my little girl will call mom. 

The changes didn't happen overnight but I know it happened much faster than it would have had I continued to get high every day. When I was smoking I wanted to change but being high kept me lazy. In order to make a big change you start with lots of little changes. When I was smoking I didn't have the time, money, or motivation to incorporate those little changes into my life. 

I decided to quit out of the blue. I knew I was addicted. I knew I would want to quit eventually.  An old friend of mine who I used to smoke with told me his story of how he quit. Somehow seeing someone else do it gave me the motivation to do it myself. I kept myself busy and distracted as much as possible. I read a lot of stories on this sub reddit (r/leaves was why I joined reddit in the first place) It was hard, especially in the beginning. I wasn't sure if I could do it, but I did.

Or, really, that I would start remembering my dreams.  So, when that didn’t really happen for me right away, I was kind of bummed out.  

Four nights ago, however, that all changed.

The first night that I dreamed again, I had a nightmare.  It was a bit traumatic for me and I woke up not being able to go back to sleep for a few hours because of the shear panic that came over me from it.  I had a similar experience on the second night, although it was nowhere near as intense.

But… for the past two nights, I’ve been going flying.  As in, Superman-style flying.  I don’t recall ever having dreams like these before, and they have been AMAZING.  I just woke up from flying over my hometown of all places.  And this time, I had company with me for my flight, in the form of some random stranger who’s hand I grabbed and invited along!

I know it may sound silly and trivial to some of you, but to me, this is something that I haven’t experienced before, at least nowhere near this intense.  What’s crazy to me is how much detail I’ve been able to remember from these dreams after I wake up.  I wasn’t prepared for that.  I started keeping a dream journal after the second night.  I hope to fill it with lots of wonderful things.

Good or bad, to date, having these dreams have been an amazing experience, and I hope they will continue!

This is it. I am NEVER going back. All my issues I've suppressed with smoking are coming to the surface and I am dealing with them head on. Here is what I did and am doing,"Hey guys, 

I have smoked for 8 years and been miserable for about 4 or so years. The last 2 years have been the worst. I have started to deal with the issues I have suppressed with smoking. I started talking to my parents and family and let them know I am dealing with depression. I have spoken to my doctor and I am in the process of seeing a therapist. I have also spoken to one of my friends about my depression. I am dealing with these issues head on because I cannot continue to smoke. I saw myself heading down a very dangerous and scary depressive path that only has 1 ending, and that is eternal darkness. 

Here is what I am doing to help stay off of weed

1. You need to be ""over it"". Like really over it. To the point where even when you smoke, you get anxiety and the high isn't even fun. There's literally no point. I got a stressful job a couple months ago that requires all my brainpower and smoking has fucked me up. It has given me horrible anxiety. 

2. At your lowest, **record a video of yourself talking to yourself of why you want to quit**. At your lowest, you look like shit and feel like shit. When you aren't smoking, just watch that video over and over and look at how ugly you look. Remind yourself of what smoking does to you

3. Eat enough / Eat healthy - #1 is to get enough calories and #2 is to eat healthy. Eating enough calories is more important because if you don't have enough calories, you feel like complete shit the next day and will get headaches and all that and that is a MASSIVE trigger to smoke. Try to eat healthy and DRINK WATER

4. Exercise / Sauna - Even you have a shit workout, just go to to the fucking gym or go for a walk. Do something minimal. I have been putting in shit workouts but I have been going to the gym just because I want to go to the sauna. I will walk on the treadmill and do 2 muscle workouts just to get my muscles used to being sore and used again. It doesn't matter, just get some sort of movement and please go to the sauna if you have one

5. TALK TO PEOPLE - DO NOT ISOLATE all the time. Talk to whoever the fuck you need to. Talk to people. Be vulnerable. Just talk, please, just talk to people. This helps. I track my mood and days and oftentimes I'll feel like shit but I'll talk to my ex or talk to my mom and feel a little bit better

6. Waste time - I go on Tiktok and waste time. It's ok. You just need to pass the time until you get a couple days or weeks under your belt. Just love yourself for trying to be a better person. Go play video games, watch tv, go on youtube, do whatever the fuck you need to do to not smoke. After a couple weeks, you can start to be more targeting with your time and energy but you need to take baby steps. I legit spent 18 hours on tiktok on Saturday/Sunday because I was so depressed/sad/tired/bored. 

The biggest things is to just be over it and realize that we're all adults, not children. Take control of your god damn life and take some fucking ownership of yourself. I have been a mess these last 2 weeks but god damn it, it's been 2 weeks. I am NEVER going back. Fuck that. My drive right now to not smoke is at a 10/10. Fuck smoking. It doesn't even cross my mind anymore. I am never going through this bullshit again.",12,0

Used to post on here a lot and read a lot of post made on it, as time went by I stopped doing that but I never stopped staying away from the leaves. 

My gf continues to smoke leaves and I hangout with her while she does it but I never feel the urge to smoke with her or anything and now the smell of it kinda bothers me lol strangely enough cause before I would like the smell of it. 
My withdrawal symptoms are all gone as far as I’m aware. I had anxiety for a long time after and still today have health anxiety but don’t think that’s related to smoking leaves at this point. I do have increase of acid reflux which I think smoking leaves may have been keeping it at bay and now not smoking it seems like my stomach is forever messed up lol trying to get that under control but doctors take forever.

Anyways just wanted to post to archive my story and the fact I’ve made it a year without smoking and I believe in all you guys and girls on here trying to quit as well. You can do it, it gets tough but stay strong and realize life will be much better without the need of having to smoke everyday all day constantly, you’ll be free of that feeling.

Quit cold turkey the following: Hash, Nicotine, Sugar. 
I suffer from MDD already so it's been extra hard these days. 
A list of problems I'm facing so far:

Sleep issues (not sleeping enough alongside sleeping ALOT)
Appetite down the drain due to the sleep schedule.

Depression from a 2/10 to a 7/10 and 8/10 too on same days (im on meds that work for me so doesn't make sense to feel this way unless of course, weed).

0 motivation, Haven't exercised or meditated, visited the doctor, visited university to get some stuff done, and a bunch of other things I'm lazing on that need to be done.

Suicidal ideation from a 3/10 to 9/10 some days but have a great support system so it's never happening, it's quite uncharacteristic of me to have those thoughts because even in my darkest depressions i never catered to them. But now I am and i guess it's a part of the withdrawals. 

Surprisingly dont feel like lighting up at all even when around friends who are smoking up so i guess that's a plus. 

Apart from that just the usual things that are part of depression ie staying in bed whole day etc etc

This sub has been a lot of help and reading everyone's experience gives me hope that these feelings are temporary and if I push through I'll eventually feel much better. It only gets worse before it gets better. 

Still afraid of relapsing even though I'm not getting any pangs to light up but the thought of ""instead of killing yourself why not just light up and kill yourself that way at least you'll enjoy it"". It's sort of an out and I guess it's just the chemical playing tricks on me pulling all the cards but let me tell you folks it aint easy.
Anyway, not going to throw my progress away. Have my monthly psychiatrist visit soon and hopefully that will sort a lot the problems. Thinking about seeing a psychotherapist as well.

Ive posted before to share my experience but i will again
Why? Because when i was in recovery it was reading experiences here that made me get through.

I smoked 20 years.
When i stopped, i felt horrible. It got worse and worse and the peak was at 5 months.

When youre healing, its very hard to believe youll be fine  but everyone is well eventually.

My paws got worse and worse. I was exhausted all the time. A very annoying exhaustion. I fell asleep at 8 30pm and woke up around 2 every day. I was kinda ok for 3 4 hours after waking up but by the time work day started i was exhausted. 

In the afternoon at 3pm, crippled. And i couldnt nap. I couldnt go to the gym, nothing was fun, i didnt wanna date, i lost a pretty girl because i tried dating her during withdrawal but always cancelled because i was too exhausted to go out.

Nothing was fun. And the exhaustion was horrifying. I couldnt speak well and my memory was terrrible. I also looked like shit.

At month 8 i started having hope.
At month 9 i felt something was fixed and i started relaxing and sleeping well.

Now it has been 10 months and 3 weeks and since the 9 months when i felt something was fixed i got better and better and better.

Now i feel great.

I feel like going out again  doing things. I do my stuff easy. My etes look different. I look healthy. Im a much better boxer. I keep my condo clean. I speak better. Im much much more confident socially. Especially with ladies. I always wondered how come im not confident cuz im a good lookin sucessfull guy. It was the weed.

I feel, different in a way i havent felt since when i was young.

Life is beautiful without weed.

Keep it up guys because you will feel good one day and this battle will make you extremely tough mentally and your life will change around.

After you feel good, give it some time to naturally meet people and find things to do, it will come by itself. Thats one thing that was hard to understand but when youre a pot smoker you basically smoke and dont do shit and are ok with it. Once you wake up and have desire to go out and do things youll realize you were missing a lot of things to fill your life with because you just smoked and didnt do much and were ok with it.

Quitting weed was the best decision of my life. Keep it up, its not easy and if you make it youre a fucking warrior.

I’ve been smoking for around 7 years…both flower and concentrates. I have wanted to quit for probably a year but I always kept buying whenever I was out. I had a really stressful job in the legal world and would look forward to going home and blazing it all away. I’d smoke in the morning, on my lunch break, and all night (not at all proud of it tbh) Eventually it just didn’t “spark joy” and I quit cold turkey. I haven’t smoked daily for over a month and I’ve also stopped drinking coffee. I recently moved to Chicago and used to do CrossFit 4x a week before I moved. Since quitting it has been difficult for me to drag myself into the gym…or do anything really. 

I’ve had a ridiculous amount of physical and psychological symptoms but I’m mainly concerned about:

Persistent muscle twitching (mainly in my legs)
Burning pain in my arms and legs 
Sore collarbones
Sore armpits 
Sore joints  in my hands 
Jolting awake just as I start to fall asleep

My mom died when she was 40 and since then I’ve had bad health anxiety so needless to say these symptoms are freaking me tf out 😞. I feel broken. The rational part of my brain tries to tell me to relax because all of these symptoms started after I radically reduced my consumption, but then my anxiety takes over and convinces me I’m dying of some neurological disease. I’ve had blood work done and it came back fine, had an autoimmune test done and that was negative. I went to my doc basically begging for an MRI but after a quick physical assessment, they said it was unnecessary and then gave me prescription medicine used for stage fright to help ease the anxiety. I have a mental health consultation this Friday. 

I guess I’m just wanting some reassurance and to know if anyone else has experienced symptoms similar to mine. I know it takes time and eating well, exercise and mindfulness help…I’m getting there one day at a time. Reading this forum almost daily has eased some of my anxiety. I feel like an idiot…like a sad shell of who I used to be because the anxiety is killing me. Any kind words or similar experiences are much appreciated.",5,1

This was my withdrawal timeline from when I cold turkeyed off an entire 1g cart daily.

Day 1: no appetite, felt fine otherwise, fell asleep fine.

Day 2: woke up with intense nausea. Had diarrhea probably 10 times throughout the day. Was dry heaving frequently, fighting very hard to not throw up. Had a lot of trouble getting to sleep but I got 4 hours.

Day 3: started eating a little better. Nausea subsided. Having lots of anxiety. Felt like I was getting better however and was going to wake up feeling better. 

Day 3 night: intense insomnia. I did not sleep a single second. I took 2 things and they did nothing. 

Day 4: was wide awake the entire day. Wanted to fall asleep so bad but brain absolutely would not. Did not sleep a single minute all day

Day 5: I still did not sleep at all. I went to urgent care after being awake over 68 hours. I was prescribed a controlled substance and another rx medication. I am very grateful the doctor I saw knew exactly what was going on and how to treat me. He said that he has had plenty of people in there who have been awake even longer than me bc of weed

Day 6: the medicine worked. I slept 11 straight hours and woke up feeling 100% back to normal. Zero anxiety, appetite issues sleep issues or anything once I started these medications. Actually ended up going out and playing golf all day.

Withdrawal was over after I got these meds. Highly recommend. Was like being grabbed out of hell and put straight into heaven

I had panic attacks, depression, paranoia, hypochondria, digestive issues, fatigue, anger, fuckin every goddamn awful thing you can think of. It was horrible.

Now, at 5 months it’s hard to believe I was living the way I did. Always high, always hitting nicotine, always drinking. I’m definitely in a hell of a lot better place now.

I lost over 30 lbs since then. I’m back doing standup comedy which I put off for so long being a lazy stoner and never writing material. I definitely have a much more organized and structured life now. 

My life isn’t “amazing” now because I quit weed. I just gave myself a fighting chance to work hard and build a better life for myself. 

The beginning is horrible, like I said. It is soo worth getting through. I have faith in you all. Peace and love!!",381,0

It's been a bit over 3 months clean and I still find myself avoiding my emotions/bodily sensations at times with things like overeating, smoking cigarettes, or video games/being online. Though, I am getting more connected to myself through body focused meditation, being open about how I feel in therapy and with others, and yoga. 

I find it helpful to create moments throughout the day just to be with myself, creating space away from constant distraction and stimulation.

What helps you?",3,0

How are you filling your time when you already do the dopamine-enhancing stuff like exercise and preparing nourishing meals?  I've tried out dozens of new hobbies but nothing sticks.

Initially, it started out as something to do once a month or so with friends. The feeling made me feel different, it was magical. When I was around 22, I moved out of my parents' house temporarily because I got a job contract in a small town for 16 months. The town was lonely and had a pretty high crime rate. That's when I started smoking pot everyday from the boredom. Over the years, there have been periods of 2-3 months where I don't touch any weed. But the moment I let my guard down and try it again, it becomes an everyday thing (sort of).

I have broken down the effects of my use into pros and cons. The negatives will encourage me to quit, but where I see a challenge is turning away from the benefits I got from smoking weed.

**Pros**

* Weed is an escape. I am currently living with my family, which includes my parents and my brother. My father has a very toxic personality. Like, he treats my mom like shit and thinks he is the most important member of the family. He doesn't work, he doesn't help with any household chores, he just orders the other 3 of us around like we owe him something. Weed is kind of an escape. I like to go and just chill in my car in the parking lot (we live in an apt). I smoke up, go for a walk, enjoy the beautiful weather outside and come back home with a fresh mind. I did this like 2-3 times a day, generally after every meal.
* I sometimes smoke weed before working out. I find that when I smoke weed, it helps me crank out more reps when I am lifting weights. For example, on average I bench 135 lbs for about 8-9 reps, but I can also bench 185 lbs for 3-4 reps. When I smoke up, I can do 12-14 reps with 135 lbs. I don't attempt higher weights because I don't think it's safe. Moreover, I feel like weight lifting kinda fits in with the stoner persona. You lift weights for 10-20 seconds and then you rest for 1-2 minutes (do nothing except stare at yourself in the mirror). Perfect stoner activity. 

**Cons**

* I feel stupid when I talk to people. Last week, my friend picked me up to go out for a beer. And in hind sight, I feel that I was talking a lot of nonsense. My thoughts lack a certain coherence and it's harder to articulate them.
* I feel that as I get older, I am panicking a lot more and weed makes me feel on edge. I am having more instances where I am sitting in my car, smoking pot and suddenly, I start panicking when one of the neighbors walks by. There is absolutely no reason to be. Weed is legal where I live, but I sit alone and panic nevertheless. (I just smoke weed in my car, I don't drive after or anything)
* Sometimes I get chest pain. I have read that it's normal because of the way your arteries contract and relax, and your blood pressure goes up and down. But it adds to the panicky feeling.
* It just doesn't feel the same. Remember that magical feeling I talked about when I first started smoking it in my teens? That's just not there anymore. It feels like the same old shit. Like, why am I even doing this?
* I can feel the high lasting for lesser and lesser time. There was a time when I couldn't smoke a whole joint alone and even then, I'd be stoned for 3-3.5 hrs. Now I'm doing bong rips every 2-3 hrs.
* I work from home right now, and being high hasn't affected my productivity in any way. But I find that I am more focused for longer when I work sober. 

**Unknowns**

* I'm not sure what the long term effects are on my brain. Am I at an increased risk of dementia or heart disease or something like that from all the pot I've been smoking?
* I work out and go on runs regularly after smoking weed. I am very much a daytime, active smoker. But just because I am able to run and exercise high doesn't mean that my lungs are functioning at optimal conditions. Maybe the smoke is reducing my VO2 max and I am not achieving my full potential when it comes to running...?
* Come to think of it, of all the activities I do high, I don't know if I am achieving my full potential.

I just ran out of my last bit of weed yesterday, and thought I'd make this post. I am curious to see what a sober life feels like again.

I’ve been using near enough every day for 10 years. I thought weed was my medicine, it was actually my poison. I’ve been using it to numb myself, to mask my feelings and drown out the darkness inside me. 

The first week was brutal. Couldn’t sleep, constantly in a state of panic. Continuously thinking, “things would be a lot easier if could just get high” but I feel now, after a month cold turkey, that it is getting easier. I can fall asleep now. But I still have vivid nightmares and cold sweats almost every night. I used weed to pass the time of day. Now I’ve joined the gym and try to fill my days being out of the house as much as possible. 

Not having weed as my coping mechanism has meant a lot of negative feelings have come back to the surface. Self loathing, ideation, anxiety, etc. With the weed gone now there is nowhere to hide, and I’ve been forced to confront and sit with and feel those feelings. That’s been the worst of it really.
 
For the past however many years, I’ve been walking around in a fog and finally the fog is starting to clear.

TL;DR: it sucks but I’m gaining some clarity.

135,2021-09-27 13:28:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pwlzvo/throw_out_your_weed/,Throw out your weed,"This has been the biggest ‘hack’ for me. Not selling it to a friend, not ‘putting it out of sight’ or in a lockbox.

Think about how hard it is to break up with someone you see on a daily basis. Not very easy. There’s familiarity. There’s torment. There might be booty calls.

Firstly, and most importantly, when you toss your weed out (somewhere you can’t easily get back to) you create physical separation from weed. This is crucial. If you were an alcoholic, keeping liquor in the house would be a terrible idea. 

I can’t smoke weed today, because I don’t have any. There’s nothing. If I did, I’d find a pathetic excuse to smoke, and then sit around regretting it.

There’s a dispensary 20 minutes away, but that’s plenty of time to talk myself out of it. Plus, I’m kinda lazy - and that’s an extra physical block in my way that I’d have to climb over to get to the thing I’ve decided isn’t good for me. Physical separation is important.

Listen, if I decided to get some today, I could. Easily. But I’m making it inconvenient, and that works for me and a lot of people.

“But I paiiiiid $xxx for it!” Remember, weed has NO value in your life. You’ve already decided that. So cut your losses and sprinkle that income reducing, relationship-eroding, life-inhibiting, brain-damaging stuff into the wind as you smile like someone stepping out of mine after spending 2 weeks down there.

I can’t eat peanut butter cups today because I told my wife not to buy any. There’s no supply. 

I can’t reset the counter back to day 0 in this moment, and that’s a good thing. 

So, toss out your weed. If you’re gonna quit; quit. 

Love you guys.",5,0

I knew I’d make it, but boy was that first week tough.  The physical symptoms were so rough the first week, but they have decreased significantly!! I didn’t sweat the past two nights and was able to get a really good nights rest.  My bed feels SO comfortable.  I still wake up with crazy energy and I need to move around in the morning before doing anything, but that’s not so bad.  I was depressed and lonely last week and that feeling still is lingering, but I’d much rather deal with emotional duress than not being able to change the way my body is feeling.  I think I just have to rediscover what I enjoy while sober, and get into a routine without weed.  Exercise is THE BEST THING.

To anyone suffering right now - it will get better! Be kind to yourself and give your body what it needs.  My mind was often running in circles saying I needed to get out and do something, but my body just wasn’t having it and that’s ok.  You’re allowed to be lazy and go to bed at 7pm if you feel like that’s what you need to get through.  Stay strong!

Not really sure why I'm posting, I don't ever really post on reddit. I guess it feels more official. Today's my 25th birthday, I was a dedicated smoker, and I think it's finally time to end this phase of my life after 6 years or so. I only really smoked in the evening, so it was easy to pretend that I don't have a ""real"" problem, just spicing up the last few hours of the day. But the last couple weeks, I tried not smoking for a day or two just to see what that was like. And I'm realizing all the lies I believe about what I'm doing..

Even with the withdrawals, it really doesn't take me any longer to fall asleep, i'm just way more lucid for that hour or two in bed. And waking up is so much easier without the weed hangover (yes, i do get a weed hangover even though that's not a ""real"" thing). I told myself it's for anxiety, and now I realize how often I get panic attacks when I smoke. They're just covered by a haze. I told myself it's to make myself 'cooler' socially, but whenever I do it socially i get even clammier and awkward than I usually am. I told myself it's to relax, but it only makes me okay with being completely bored and unproductive.

After a couple days off, I tried smoking again yesterday evening, and I just felt bad. I felt stupid and complacent and hazy and objectively worse off than if I was sober. So it's time for a change. 

I wrote out a very heartfelt pros and cons list to weed sobriety. The pros list sounds forward-thinking, and honest, and productive. The cons list just felt like a bunch of stoner excuses. So, this morning, I scoured my apartment for every bit of paraphernalia I could find, wrapped it up, and put it away in the most inconvenient place I could find.

&#x200B;

I'm scared, but it's time for a change. Today, my job is sobriety.

I felt hopeless and defeated, didn't feel like doing anything. I'm only now just realizing the real reason I smoked and why I should stop. 

I probably would have cringed at the title for this post for the majority of my life. I didn't even know what the word love even meant because I was unfortunate enough to never experience it. How could I realize I was missing something that I never even really understood? If somebody asked me if I loved myself I'd think they were stupid - what the hell does that even mean? I'm not one of those deluded happy fucks jumping up and down giving themselves a high five. Hell no I didn't love myself, how could I love something that nobody else did? 

The only love I really felt and knew was that I LOVED smoking weed and the feeling of relief and comfort that weed brought. I loved being relaxed and seemingly at peace with the world. Why wouldn't I want to feel good as opposed to feeling like shit? I convinced myself that feeling good with weed was better than feeling like shit. 

After 5.5 months in I just didn't have a reason to stay quit, especially when the world seemingly was going to hell march 2020. I wrote a post when I was just about ready to relapse called ""why we smoke in the first place"" and I didn't really know the answer. Quitting weed was so difficult, draining, hopeless I gave in and went back to getting high. A year and a half of getting back on the weed I think I've figured out the real reason I couldn't keep off reefer.

The stinking thinking of ""How am I going to sit around the house doing nothing without weed?"" The answer should have been obvious... don't sit around the house doing nothing! I couldn't even imagine a world where I ""felt"" like being productive working towards a goal and actually feeling good about myself for trying and not  feeling like a fucking loser. I was discounting all the positive things in my life and giving in to the negative.

Smoking weed is like an abusive relationship with myself I wasn't ready to let go.  It was hard admitting that I was just pretending my problems didn't exist and I was a coward hiding under my weed blanket. Weed made me feel good, but only as long as I was high. I couldn't let it go because it gave me something to love, even though it was bad for me. I didn't realize at the time that I was in love with a fucking plant more than myself. Deep down I knew it was fucking my life up, which made me feel bad, which made me just run back to weed.

It's easy to fall in the trap of ""oh what's the big deal? it will make me feel good"" but not nearly as good as staying off of it and actually addressing the root cause. Relapsing only hid from myself how much I hated myself, gave me a reason to feel like a piece of shit. 

Quitting is going to be my way of loving myself, treating myself with love and respect. I hope this wasn't too cringeworthy for people but I think it's a really foreign concept that took me forever to realize that I was actually capable and worthy of loving myself more than some stupid fucking plant. Weed may make you feel good for a short while but it's nothing compared to how good compared to loving myself, as corny as that sounds.",156,0
141,2021-09-27 10:54:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pwisje/here_we_go_again_deciding_to_quit_delta_8/,Here we go again... (deciding to quit Delta 8),"I've posted here before, so I won't go into the whole story, but I've been smoking since I was 17, and I've been addicted basically since the first time I smoked. Around a year ago I managed to quit for a full 5 months, but I ended up trying out Delta 8 THC and went right back to using it daily ever since. 

I can't moderate my usage. Even after getting the worst panic attack of my life a few weeks ago (>180bpm heart rate) and thinking I was going to die, I still went right back to it after taking a break for just a day. When I was actively at the peak of my panic attack, I remember thinking to myself that at least the silver lining was that this would give me the motivation to finally quit weed, but turns out even that wasn't enough. I've thrown out my carts many times after I get high, but I always end up fishing them out of the garbage the next day when I'm sober. As many people have described here, I usually only realize I want to quit after I've already smoked.

To remind myself why I want to quit, I'm going to list the main reasons:

1. It makes me anxious and paranoid
1. It's the only thing to ever give me panic attacks, the worst feeling of my life
1. It makes me sluggish and tired all the time
1. It makes me unmotivated to do any of my hobbies
1. It makes me not want to call my family and friends because I'd rather get stoned and watch TV instead
1. It makes me not even want to enjoy new content because that takes too much mental focus. I only watch TV shows I've already seen before, and I've started even re-listening to podcast episodes so I don't need to pay attention too well
1. It makes me binge eat and keeps me fat. I've been tracking my calories, but sometimes when I smoke I lose the willpower to diet. Yesterday I ate so much that I literally felt sick, and then I went back for more as soon as I started to feel well enough to not be lying down. It made me feel disgusted with myself, and I ruined a perfect week of dieting.
1. It makes me feel like I'm damaging my lungs / esophagus. I know it's better than smoking, but vaping daily does take its toll. I wake up every morning with my lungs feeling inflamed and my throat feeling sore. I go to sleep needing to clear my throat a ton because of the inflammation, and I cough during the day even though I only smoke in the evenings. I'm worried I'm going to cause irreparable damage or even cancer if I keep this up. 
1. It just makes me feel generally shitty about myself knowing that I keep going back to a drug that's hurting me. 
1. It makes me conceal things from my girlfriend. I'm ashamed of my addiction so I'm not as honest about it as I should be. My girlfriend is the love of my life and is not judgemental of me, but I usually vape without telling her so she won't know I use it daily. I'm too embarrassed and ashamed, and not being open about it with her makes me feel like a bad boyfriend. I don't even tell my *therapist* about it because I'm so ashamed (I know that's ridiculous and irrational, but it is what it is).

Typing this all out really helped put this in perspective for me. It's so easy to just let my brain try to justify it and latch onto the few positive effects of the drug on my life. I think it's not good to try to lie to myself that there aren't any positive effects because there definitely are some (feeling uplifted momentarily, taking the edge off at the end of a work day, enjoying humor more, etc), but the point is that these positive effects are very fleeting and are significantly outweighed by the many negative impacts of weed on my life. 

I threw out my carts again, and I really hope this time they make it to the dumpster before the addictive urge takes over and I end up fishing them out of the can. I'm going to give it a real try, and I hope I'm able to make it farther than 5 months this time. I know myself well enough that this isn't going to be the last time I smoke weed, but I'm hoping that this will bring me closer to truly quitting for the rest of my life. 

Thank you for reading, and best of luck to all of you who are in this journey with me. It's just good knowing that I'm not alone.",5,0

Long story short I picked it back up after he started to buy it a lot and I didn’t put it back down. I’m a slave to it again, it takes my energy, my life, my attention, my money . It takes everything. I use it to escape reality and not have to face what’s going on. It kind of just calms me down and takes my mind off reality. But I need to stop it kills my lungs, I’ve gained so much weight from smoking. It’s just not for me. Pray for me that I never pick it up ever again! So proud of all of you who put it down and never pick it up again bc it slowly kills!",3,0

My dreams are no longer that vivid unless I intensely meditate before sleeping. 2 days ago I spent around an 1hr doing deep meditation and I ended up feeling like I was floating around in this weird energy. I stayed pretty present but I knew my body fell asleep like 30 minutes into this meditation it was real weird I stayed like that all night floating and kinda connecting with that energy.

Since my faulting around 15 days ago I havent had a single urge to smoke. I also decided that my current career path isn't for me and to follow my dreams. I put in over 50 applications to jobs in that field knowing I lack experience; I've been meditating and doing my affirmations everyday tryna drag this career path to me at a pay rate that wont drop me to far under what I get paid now as an experienced worker in my field. I landed a couple interviews with some small companies that only care about drive not experience and I have an offer on the table and an interview today with a company I actually want to work for and as I was writing this got another interview landed 😅. The law of attraction is real people manifest your dreams 🤘. 

I do think weed held me back alot i would have been stuck here in what i think is a dead end career (the company isnt bad just I dont think it fits me) and I would be insanely unhappy. However threw this journey of quitting I found put alot about the law of attraction, meditation, and the  power of reading books. I'm just happy to be attracting good things to me these days. 

I hope you all are hitting your goals out there. Stay safe. And be blessed.",3,0

Had resigned to and accepted the fact that I'd just be a daily stoner for the rest of my life. Weed caused me a lot of negativity and eventually that got the better of me and at some point I realized that smoking weed, or not, was in my control so I decided to do something about it. This community was not an insignificant part of that. 

One thing that helped me A LOT was having expectations on what my quitting timeline would look like. Getting that information from people who were in a situation similar to mine helped me set my own realistic expectations. In the past I'd quit for a week or 3 and then throw in the towel thinking ""if this is how life is without weed, then I don't want it"". What I didn't understand was it would take time to have some meaningful recovery from weed. It helped me to remain patient and to not think things would move along faster than they really would.

Here is what my timeline looked like in terms of recovery:

**Week 1 to 2:**

This was the worst of the entire processes in terms of intensity. I was craving a lot and thought about weed often. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat and my mood was all over the place. I took a lot of hot baths and didn't put too much pressure on myself to perform at my usual capacity in all terms (career, relationships, father, house maintenance, etc)

**Week 2 to week 8:**

The intensity calmed down. Cravings were not as severe. I still thought about weed a lot and there would have been temptations had I not had such a strong resolve to stop. I had headaches and was tired a lot. Still took a lot of hot baths (not sure what it was about that but I found it quite therapeutic and not something I would normally do that often). I'd take naps almost daily as I was exhausted. My mood was fairly low but at the same time I felt kind of peaceful and like life had slowed down (in a good way). I was able to put more effort towards life again, even if it didn't feel all that rewarding. If I had to put a number on it I was probably functioning at 60% capacity. Sleep still wasn't great but once in a while I'd get a straight 6 hours or so.

**Week 8 to 4 months:**

Lots of emotional turmoil going on during this phase. I didn't feel very motivated for life. Smoking some weed here to get back to my old baseline would have been appealing if I was not so determined to quit. Knowing that there would be eventual light at the end of this dark tunnel helped me a lot. My mood did get more stable during this time and there would be the occasional good mood where I felt positive sprinkled in that helped me out. I did my best to stay engaged and put effort into my life, career, hobbies, relationships, etc. Sleep was slowing getting a little better but still not great. Naps still common place - I got sleep where I could. Headaches started to wane. 

**Month 4 to 6:** 

This is where the tide started to change. As these months progressed there were more and more glimmers of hope. More positive thoughts, more energy and thoughts of weed now were few and far between (still daily but much less than compared to before). Headaches were now gone and sleep was acceptable, not for long periods like my former stoner sleep but the quality was much improved. Hot baths no longer required all the time and my mood was more tolerable. I was starting to get into the groove of life. If I had to put a number on it I was probably about 75%.

**Month 6 and beyond:**

I wasn't fully recovered at 6 months and I'm not fully recovered today either (\~16 months). Recovery, I've discovered, has many prongs. I barley think of weed anymore (relative to before). I don't have ""cravings"" - there are thoughts but never of actually using it that I have to resist. My mood is much more stable and mostly I'm just engaged in life and don't think a whole lot about recovery (at least not like I did before). My thoughts about recovery now are more productive. One of the main prongs of recovery for me has been self improvement. Once I identify character flaws or problems with myself that I would like to address then I come up with a plan and some realistic goals. Another prong of recovery is to break all the old habits that being a stoner caused. A lot of unhealthy habits were developed along with weed due to the not giving a shit about much factor while stoned. I'm still working on them (unhealthy diet for example). Life is a lot better now. There is a lot more peace in life now and it doesn't feel like I'm on the side lines just watching time pass by while my stoned self just fumbles about from day to day. 

How long recovery will last, I don't know, somewhere it will transition from recovering from weed to just making normal self improvements in the course of normal life. Recovering from both booze (\~4 years) and weed have been the best choices I have made in my life. I keep my guard up because I know that one hit or one drink for me is the beginning of a path leading back to where I started. Sure, a lot of good times were had with drinking and smoking but they are far outweighed by the negatives that went along with it. I'm not prepared to give up what I've achieved for some temporary bliss that comes with an unmeasurably heavy price tag. A sober life is a more predictable one and one where I can set realistic goals and then set out to achieve them.",61,0

I've always been a stoner, even still called myself that when I had a 6 year dry spell (in a small town with no real source). Now I'm in a state where it is legal so I can get it / use it whenever, and I'm in that space where I *want* to quit but also like... Keep blowing myself off I guess. But I also know that with other things going on in my life, I really should officially do this. 

I'm not new to quitting addictive habits, I've quit smoking cigarettes, and recently had a 5 month stretch of not drinking. Which because of ""things"" I caved, but even tho those problems are still here, I'm ready to get back on that wagon. 

So I'm gonna be hanging around here a bit. I've got some coping techniques from when I quit drinking, and I plan on using those (mindfulness, exercise, journaling, staying busy with projects). r/stopdrinking was a huge help, if anyone may need support in that area. 

Mostly I'm just introducing myself, but I'm also asking for any pointers or tips. I'll try not to complain too much about whatever withdrawals I get. 

I know I can do this, just man I am not looking forward to this beginning part. 

Anyway, I hope everyone has a good day

It doesn’t help that the place I live in has been in lockdown for the past 2 months. I haven’t seen people even when I’ve had the opportunity to because I have no energy or motivation to socialise. I have barely left my house, I can’t find the energy to brush my teeth and clean my room let alone speak fo people. Quitting has made me realise what a low point in my life this has been. I feel like I’ve damaged myself so much mentally. And now I feel more depressed than ever even though I haven’t smoked in 6 days. I want this feeling to go away so bad and I wish I could just smoke for some relief. 

What scares me about continuing to stay sober is that I know I’ll need to start getting my shit together. I’m about to turn 20 and I’ve never been employed, never had a proper boyfriend. Anxiety has prevented me from working and learning to be an adult. I’ve been so terrified my entire life of everything around me. I know that quitting means I have to deal with these issues that I’ve completely neglected while smoking. And that scares the fuck out of me. 

It feels like everyone around me is moving on with their life while I’m on pause. And I’m still stuck here wishing that I could smoke all the pain away. I don’t know how to overcome this. I don’t have a psychologist appointment until the end of the week and I honestly don’t know who to turn to for support. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with this depression?

I lurked on this sub for quite awhile before getting up the courage to quit. Cannabis, and my focus on it, took me to some really terrible lows in my life. Some things I've learned about withdrawls and quitting:

&#x200B;

1. Mindset. This has been one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life. I was way more addicted than I realized until I quit. For me, having the realization that I'm 40 and can never smoke again was key. I see a lot of people on here try and rationalize using again in weeks/months. You're just come back to the same place. Also, why would you want to go through the weeks-long withdrawl period again? Mindset that I'm 100% done with the plant helps. No cheating, No t-breaks, just abstinence from here on out.
2. Sleeping. Sleeping is related to how you handle the other withdrawl symptoms and it really makes it tough. I'm slept a lot better on day 8 and 9 and hope that is here to stay now. Being tired and irritable has definitely made me not fun to be around and increases the anxiety/depression. I need to exercise more but I found just walking my dog a lot and stuff like that helped tire me out, and I slept a little better.
3. Emotions. Most of us are emotional wrecks during our first 2 weeks of quitting, at least. The waves of anxiety and depression can be excruciating. I actually had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life during week 1. That really scared me and it made me ""hyper-aware"" that these feelings were ONLY from the withdrawls and not a rational ME. It is so much easier just to follow your emotions but, having a little emotional intelligence, really made this part easier. I'm still cranky, sad, stressed, and sometimes feel a little hopeless but I realize these feelings will go away. Don't give in to these feelings ,cry about them or whatever you need to, then move on.

&#x200B;

Anyways, thanks for everyone in this sub for the encouragement. It got my confidence up and I did it earlier than I told myself I would! My plan was to get quitting tips for ""next year"" lol.

I (31M) smoked everyday for over a decade and I’ve been lurking around here, on and off, since I was 22.

I would turn into a monster each time I tried to quit… which was fairly often because I had no doubt that smoking weed had a terrible impact on my life.

The truth was I had become a monster anyway. I wasn’t treating the people around me right. I had become completely selfish and self-centered. Narcissistic and yet somehow full of self-hatred at the same time. I was putting 20% effort into my life. Nothing could make me happy. A dopamine fiend in the worst way.

Literally every aspect of my life has improved since I’ve stopped. My 8-year relationship is better than it’s ever been, by a lot. My work and financial situation is dramatically better. I’m showering more often, I’m doing more things that engage my mind, I’m spending more time outside. 

My mental health has improved exponentially - my anxiety and depression haven’t totally gone away but most of the time they’re like dull voices in the back of my mind instead of a constant living breathing reality.

I never thought this could happen. I’ve been so lost for so long. I’ve been under a cloud I never thought I’d get out of. Honestly I’m tearing up right now. I feel so blessed and so lucky to have my life back.

I HAVE MY FUCKING LIFE BACK.

Wow it feels so good to say that.

Don’t ever give up. If you know you need to stop, then don’t stop stopping. No matter how many times you fail. I failed dozens and dozens of times. Keep trying and someday it will click. I promise there is a better world on the other side.

It's been 2 months today since I quit weed. I still get cravings from time to time, but no physical symptoms anymore.

The first few days were horrible. Withdrawl was intense, anxiety skyrocketed. 2 weeks in, I started dreaming again at night. CRAZY dreams at first, but they got normal as time went on.

I don't get a physical ""need"" to smoke again. Stressfull situations bring the cravings back on my mind, but medication is helping.

My closest friend and I decided we should stop smoking, together. A few weeks ago, we fought (for long and complicated reasons), and we are not on speaking terms anymore because of it. It makes me sad, and it makes me want to smoke. Especially today when we crossed paths in a parking lot. I have no idea if she saw me. All I want to tell myself is ""I don't care"". And that would be lying.

I can't say that I'm happy right now (in life). But I'm happy I got here, I'm happy I decided to stop, and I'm happy I held on.

All that to say this: I don't need to smoke anymore. I REALLY want to, but I won't. That's when I have to mentally dedicate myself, focus on the few good things that are still there, and go forward.

I’ve been basically an everyday smoker for 20 years. I have always dreamed of being a casual smoker, but never had the discipline. I would say “ only on the weekends “ or “ only at friends houses” this would last for a week or two then I’d be back at it, smoking all day and hating myself for it. The times I would quit for a few weeks I would smoke that first time and feel amazing thinking to myself this is what weed is meant to be. It would feel so good I would be happy and laughing without all the negative thoughts. Id tell myself if you only do it once and awhile look how much better it is. Yet It never lasted, within a week I’d be smoking before work again and craving a bowl all day. After reading so many people’s same experiences I’ve decided that I just can’t do it anymore. So here I am 7 days in I feel good about my choice. The only thing I can say is I’m really bored at times. I think that was my trigger. At the first sign of boredom I’d just get high, being in my head all the time kept me entertained but also kept me from doing anything else. Here’s to another sober day tomorrow! Thanks everyone for sharing their stories and successes.",16,0

So I kept smoking, even though it wasn’t doing anything for me anymore besides turning me in to a vegetable. And irritated from 4-5:30PM until I got home to smoke. 

I was fighting demons yesterday and I really wanted to rip someone’s head off or break something. The voice kept telling me to go smoke so I wouldn’t be so irritable. I came really close to just taking one hit on a J left by my partner. Instead I logged in and read everyone’s posts.

I know this feeling all to well and I am sick of it. 

I was wondering if anyone found that AFTER quitting they played games again and had a bigger interest in it again etc. I know it may seem an obvious question but I just miss the old me that would play games and lift weights through life instead of moping. 

I know most people want to quit games as well but I kinda' don't have much ambition in life in terms of conventional norms but I have a lot of my own interests in terms of personal gain and income etc but I've just become distant from things like social life and romance and I've kind of accepted it. I have enough of that and I'm not one to go out to clubs much so my weekends are pretty game friendly 😂

Sorry for the long post. 

TL;Dr: Since quitting have you found that you played video games more again? Or interested in this part of your life again? 

Thank you.

I started smoking daily around the start of 2020, and started smoking heavier and heavier to cope/deal with a lot of stressful/traumatic events, and a toxic relationship (which I have left).I am now in super healthy + supportive relationship. Now that I am ""psychologically safe"", weed stopped being fun - I just smoked it for the sake of it.

I also decided to stop because I felt it was giving me anxiety (I'm not really an anxious person. It very much manifested as irrational relationship anxiety, seemingly out of nowhere. This was also when I really wasn't enjoying weed anymore), slowing down my cognitive function, making me ""meh"" and unmotivated, and my memory was getting worse. It was making me a shell of the super active, bright, bubbly person I was. I am super social, and I became very antisocial (no social energy for people). I work as an engineer, and yoga teacher part time, and it was really starting to affect my work.

I don't believe I am addicted to weed (in the sense of craving it, and never have), but my brain certainly has a dependency/addiction to it. I am someone who has a high emotional intelligence, very aware of breathing/coping techniques, etc. Fit and healthy.

I quit cold turkey. Here is a timeline of my withdrawals so far:

**Week 1 (Depression, nightmares, sleeplessness)**:*Day 1-3: No withdrawalsDay 3-onwards:* Sleeplessness. Extremely traumatic and disturbing dreams that were very realistic and upsetting.*Day 5*: Extreme depression kicked in. I was in bed all day, experiencing one of the hardest mental health days I have ever had.

*Day 6-7:* Hard to concentrate

**Week 2 (Depression, unable to concentrate, then Anxiety started):**  
The anxiety began. They came as large spells that would last anywhere between 1-6 hours everyday. Although I knew the anxiety was irrational, going through it is so awful. It's like knowing exactly what a head cold is - but having the head cold itself is still shit. It manifests very very strongly as irrational relationship anxiety - which is the shitty thing.

At this point, breathing exercises, outdoor exercising, journalling, changing environments, talking about it, etc do not help. The only thing that I find that helps at the moment is a hot to cold shower. Although I am not really able to concentrate well, I have a lot less brain fog. I'm not in a haze

*Day 12:* A depressive mood swing smashed me out of nowhere from about lunchtime. No idea why I was upset, crying, frustrated. I came right later than evening as I had a dinner to go to. It made me feel a lot better

*Day 13:* I relapsed with a small amount of edible. Wasn't worth, and will not be relapsing again.

**Week 3 (More anxiety, vomiting, loss of appetite):**

The puking isn't even vomiting up food. It is like the feeling becomes so overwhelming, that I start dry-retching. Even if I have eaten, no food comes up (look up cyclic vomiting and weed withdrawals. I am wondering if this is it). Once my little gag sesh is over, the anxiety is generally gone again. A lot of random crying. But am starting to laugh a lot more, and enjoying small friendly chat with others (it doesn't feel like a chore)

*Day 14-16:* Really really bad spells of anxiety. It is so suffocating

*Day 16:* Woke up full of dread/anxiety. Vomited and felt like absolute garbage until lunchtime

*Day 17:* Anxiety all morning, and puked out of nowhere mid morning when the anxiety became nearly overwhelming (I walked outside from work to get some air) I was focusing on the water, the sun, the nice weather and all of the positive things, then yakked. Had a cold shower at work to snap me out of it when exercise at lunch didn't help. Then I was good all afternoon.

*Day 18:* Major anxiety throughout the morning, with two vomiting spells (no, I am not pregnant). Was fine for the entire afternoon

*Day 19:* PRETTY MUCH NO ANXIETY AT ALL! A few little spells of it throughout the evening on and off. BUT I FELT SO GOOD I LITERALLY FELT NORMAL

*Day 20:* I woke up with anxiety again, and puked. Still feel like rubbish. Lots of crying. Had an appointment today with a CBT counselor to help me get on top of the anxiety, and feeling pretty good now. 

I am reaping positive side effects, such as less brain fog, more energy, positive emotions are more amplified. I am so much happier (apart from if I'm in an anxiety spell). I feel more myself when the anxiety isn't slamming me sideways. The other positive: TIME IS SO MUCH LONGER! I feel like I have so much more time, and my days are so much more productive!

This channel brings me so much reassurance of it is so hard emotionally quitting. I can't even imagine every touching weed again if this is what it does to you.

I smoked weed to cope with stress, so I understand my brain is rewiring. This is literally emotional hell. I hope it all ends soon :(I am finding it so hard going through this - each day I wonder ""is this what I am really like"". I hope everyone else is going well.

What was your experience? How long did it last? Any tips for the anxiety spells? Any other good advice/reassurance for myself and others?",13,0

Two weeks ago, I received news that one of my best friends took his life. It was quite literally the most sobering moment in my life. Weed was a mutual habit of ours, and I had a lot of reasons for wanting to quit before this. But man, it was the reality check no one ever wants, but someone like me needed ::sighs:: and it worked. I looked in the mirror and admitted I'm an addict, and that weed will NEVER be enough. I threw all my stuff in the garbage that night and woke up the next day ready to say that I am in recovery.  I never liked going to anon. meetings and so I really really appreciate this sub, and everyone for being so brave and sharing their stories. Quitting was never easier, and unfortunately it was because of a huge loss that I'm finally on the road to recovery, but I know in a way I'm saving myself.

I finally told my sponsee I relapsed. She figured, since I basically went MIA trying to do step work with her. So finally everyone knows. Right now I’m just taking it 1 day at a time. Sometimes minutes at a time. I work in healthcare in a hospital during the pandemic. I work in the ICU and general wards. I cried every single day the past 2 weeks. I’m drained. I have compassion fatigue. But I’ve been opening up in AA meetings that I need help. I am struggling. And that’s okay. One day at a time. 

I never want to get back into that fog of THC. I went from a one time edible in Boston in early august to in 3 weeks every night then when my friend who was living with me left, it became an all day every minute of the day habit. I hate it. It makes my anxiety worse in the mornings. It makes me lazy. It makes me dull. I’m good at what I do and I can’t do it in a fog of weed.

I’ve made it through the worst and most common withdrawls after 15 years on and off. Overall I’m pretty happy with where I’m at, except I am unemployed and looking for a new job. I have had around 12 different jobs and never stuck them out, from graphic designer to airport security you name it. I am looking at retraining and taking a software development bootcamp with a high job placement rate, all promising prospects.

My problem is that I feel like I’m just wasting away avoiding life waiting to feel “good enough” to embark on all these new things, whether its meeting new people/friends, joining a walking group and of course getting a new job. A big part of me probably just thinks I am going to fail and don’t want the heartache again, or perhaps I don’t think I can learn or achieve these goals. I’m only 30 and relatively intelligent (or used to be), yet the idea of being a developer does not appeal to me at all, staring at a bunch of code for days on end. I think I could come to enjoy it as I am good with languages and computers. I think whatever I chose to pursue I will find the same, that this lack of belief and motivation would apply to whatever direction I took right now. It feels like this is my main problem.

Then it kicked in and I got extremely high, I felt myself hallucinating and disassociating. I called my friend who lives out of town and I had my roommate take me to the emergency room. I was in full blown psychosis and I had to wait around 30 minutes to an hour to see a doctor because all of the beds were full due to I guess covid patients. 

Even when I ended up seeing a doctor, him and the rest of the staff did not take my psychosis seriously. They said that they see cases just like mine around 15 times per day. I was left by myself bc of covid guidelines and it was horrifying. I truly thought I was going to die and then I hear the medical staff outside my room making fun of me.

I understand that I ended up eventually being fine and that it doesn't seem like a big deal to the staff since they see it all of the time, but it was insanely real for me. And to have the doctor casually ask me what's wrong when I'm screaming about how I'm going to die and how hard I'm trying to stay in this reality and not get stuck in another one, the whole ordeal was a lot more traumatic than it should've been.

I quit smoking marijuana a few months ago after I got bronchitis from smoking so much. I have done one other edible a few weeks ago and it did not hit me nearly as hard as this one did, but the biggest difference is that I portioned out the other one by only eating half while with the one I ate last night, I ate the entire thing. 

After all of this, I am 100% quitting weed. Last night was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my whole life and I don't want it to happen again. Imagine feeling every emotion you could ever think of and multiply it by 200 and that's how I felt last night. I truly believed that I was dying and I was just in the hospital calling out to my mom to help me. It was so scary and so sad. I start crying every time I remember what happened and how I felt during it.

Please let this be a learning lesson. I know that weed is so normalized in our society but truly think about why you're using it. I took that edible last night because I was tired of feeling and I wanted to not feel anymore, yet the complete opposite happened.

Also if anyone has any encouraging words or if anyone has had similar experiences and don't mind sharing it, please do. My mind is still wonky the day after but I just keep on tearing up and crying whenever I remember what happened and everything I felt.",21,2

Like the ex of my mother who was a ""sober alcoholic"" and told me that even sober he had an addiction and would never be able to drink a sip of alcohol again in his life. 

I tried many times before to quit smoking weed. Once I decide I'm done, stopping isn't actually that hard. I succeed, I see all the benefits and after a few weeks I feel solid enough to ""just smoke once"" with my partner, for fun, thinking I can be more reasonable now.

But the truth is that I tend to get easily addicted to stuff, because I have anxiety issues and traumas. And dealing with them is hard, smoking is easy. I smoke once and then again the day after and a year later I realize that I am wasting my life being high all the time. This has been going on for years now and every time I go back to weed it gets worse, I smoke more and my life gets even more stressful and unbearable.

Lately weed stopped working. My life is very stressful right now, I'm leaving a job, about to start a new one, I just spent a year and half working from home and seeing no one, my social anxiety is in the roof, my relationship is having challenges, I'm depressed and I have stopped feeling like trying to be happy is worth it. I thought I would not be able to stop right now, that it was not the right time. 

Well, smoking started making me feel increasingly paranoid and anxious. It didn't feel good anymore. I took it as a sign that I had to start working on myself sober. 

I accept that it has to be a life-long commitment. I am ready to learn to deal with myself without it. It will be hard and I will want to stop but I can't. I want to experience my life and not just waste it being stuck in my own head. I want to be fully there for the new job, to work through my relationship issues and to learn to go outside and socialize again. I want to be happy.

16 1/2-17 1/2- I stopped for a while, no withdrawal symptoms, perfectly fine
17 1/2-19 (now) - smoked 2-5 blunts a day, every day

I stopped on June 27th and had many of the normal withdraw symptoms… brain fog, no appetite, insomnia… etc. 

I went almost 3 months without it and the symptoms started subsiding and I was living my new sober life. 

3 weeks ago my brothers friend came over with weed and I couldn’t resist myself. I took 2 hits out of a one hitter and the next morning I was fine. 

A few days later the cravings were so bad so I bought me a g and rolled it up and took 4 hits, and then had a massive panic attack. Nothing but sleep could fix it, and I didn’t get much of that. The next day, I woke up with the worse brain fog. 3 weeks later, and it’s still here. I’ve gotten migraines, have had the same symptoms from when I first quit. 

My question is, is it possible to be back at “square one” and going through all of this again over a little 2 time thing?

Will it get better?

I've been smoking weed on a daily basis for the past 6-7 years or so. (I'm 26 now.) I always considered myself functional, I have a decent job, a nice group of friends who smoke with me but they don't smoke on their own like I do. I haven't smoked in 36 days now, but only because my dealers quit or have been caught and it's highly illegal in my country. 

I have a sense of shame in that I'm just clean because I'm not ""popular"" enough and always found it difficult to network in that regard. I do have people from my past who I know are smoking, but messaging anyone who I haven't talked to in years and is barely an acquaintance just to attempt to get weed also seems like a shameful act.

For the past 3 weeks, I had to work nights temporarily, I edit videos for a crowd-funded media outlet, which I love by the way, but sleeping has been really difficult after it, since I essentially stopped smoking right before it. I've been desperate to get weed and some ""connections"" mislead me into believing that I could, but all of that has failed so far. Now I'm at the point where I no longer have to work nights so sleeping will be somewhat easier. So now I'm at the point where I feel like I should just let this all go forever, but that thought terrifies me. 

 I recognize the negative effect regular smoking has on my life. I'm clearly less productive while high all day, not doing house chores like I should and leave my partner to do most of them which is something I also feel really bad about. The days just melt away and I'm exhausted from smoking even though I accomplished nothing and I'd tend to fall asleep thinking that I have to take a step back and be better tomorrow, and then I'd do the same thing again. 

I've though about quitting a lot, but never actually wanted to make that choice to be honest, and the reason is that I enjoy it.  I really love the feeling I get while smoking, and specifically while smoking, not being stoned after it. I'm afraid to go into detail here as I don't want to break the sub rules, but that's the thing I can't imagine finding a replacement for. I understand that for the sake of my health I should replace this with something more real, but I don't even believe that to be possible. My mind has defaulted to finding joy and release in the self-destructive patterns I've followed in my young adulthood. 

One thing that makes things difficult for me is not having anyone around me who understands what I'm going through with all of this. I'm considering getting help from a professional dealing with addiction, but felt like I could use other perspectives of people who had similar experiences. 

Hope this is allowed. Stay strong everyone and thanks for this community, you are all really great.",10,0

I've been trying to quit smoking weed in earnest since January. I signed up for an online outpatient rehab program around then, and while it was really helpful and I learned a lot I relapsed pretty much every thirty days and then went right back to smoking all day when I got out about a month ago. I was trying to recover while still working and basically not changing much else about my life, and like they say if nothing changes then nothing changes.

I was thinking of myself as a puzzle piece trying to figure out where I fit, trying to find one thing or one person that will fit on all sides. I need to learn both to stand on my own and to connect with other people. That's going to be hard and I think I'm up for the challenge

So I've been sober for 26 days now. I used to vape flower from the moment i wake up to when I go to sleep every day, about 1.5g every week. Yeah, not that much, but with a vape that was the amount i settled on long-term. Worked for me. I'd expected to become more productive, clear headed, less anxious, the usual, when sober.

So far, I've mostly been the most depressed I've been in a long time. About 3/5ths of my days I'll have long periods where I'm completely apathetic and unmotivated to do anything. I don't even have cravings, and the withdrawal was over in a few days too. I'm less productive than before, still have about as much social anxiety, and i still regularly get overwhelmed by everything going on in my life.

Is this normal? What are your experiences with mood and depression when quitting weed? I'm expecting to get CBT and stuff somewhere down the line which gives some hope, but it'd be nice if things improved in the meanwhile too.

The cravings DO go away. They will pop back in from time to time, but the farther down the line you get with sobriety, the less and less it affects you.
2. Be prepared to potentially have some INSANE dreams. Every night for the past two weeks has been a visual epic in my head.
3. My thoughts are crystal clear.
4. My anxieties are still there, but in a way where I can confront them and start to deal with them. Weed made me feel like my anxieties went away, but they were always there right below the surface.
5. More money. Now that I'm not dropping lots of cash on green every month, I got rid of my shitty clunker of a car that was constantly breaking down and causing me stress, and I could afford a loan payment for a nicer, more reliable one.
6. I've experienced plenty of mood swings, but those have decreased over time, and when I do get suddenly pissed off or stressed out, I can reason my way through it.
7. Meditation, exercise, reading, journaling, therapy, and friendship have been key for me.
8. Speaking of friendship, I feel like my friends are finally interacting with the real me, instead of the foggy, slow, stoner version of myself.
9. My creativity hasn't suffered at all. If anything it's blossomed.
10. I like this new me.

well, I did exactly that, ended up staying up all night playing diablo 2 got the munchies ate an entire block of chocolate had an hours sleep before work, then called in sick had a miserable day feeling unmotivated didn't work out, 

the reasons why I quit were I'm overweight, anti social, binge eat, get very lazy can't be bothered working out or studying or even any form of work.

addiction is very real for me ONE sesh and I break all my own rules. I want to be in control of my life so here we go again. 

hopefully, this time is a longer/better experience as I quite often do this to myself now ill go 1-3 months then feel I need a blowout.. sometimes it's 1 joint other times it's 3/4 days of binge smoking before I finally get back on the horse and if its a 2 day plus relapse it takes me a lot longer to get my head right again sober.

PS if you are wondering when I am sober I find I have so much more control, I'm not perfect by any means but I genuinely try to live my life with so much more responsibility. I actually study,workout,eat healthy, things that are important to me.

Earlier today I found  a rain-soaked stub from a blunt that my nephew smoked on my deck a week+ ago. Instead of disposing of it immediately, I had a “hmmm” moment and put it aside as a possible (terrible) choice to redirect my current malaise. Keep in mind that I have been a huge lightweight for some time, so there’s plenty of weed in this stub to get me pretty buzzed, most likely trigger anxiety and other uncomfortable stuff, and sabotage my progress - if history is any indication, taking even one hit from this would trigger another relapse that might not be as brief as the last one.

So….I have made the better choice to come riff about it here, and I will now go show my “bit of treasure” to my husband and flush it. A small, but significant victory, and hopefully a positive step that I can build on for the rest of this journey.  Thanks for “listening!”",4,0

PAWS?,"So, over the last 115 days since quitting weed and alcohol, I've noticed that my capacity to be alone with my thoughts has diminished. I often describe my usual mental state as ""melancholy"". I feel depressed all the time, but it's not always an ""in your face"" kind of thing. Most of the time it's a low-level sadness that seems to have no rhyme or reason. I can't pinpoint why I am sad, but I know that I am. I also often find simple things to get me very overwhelmed and that afternoons are difficult for me. By the evening, my depression is much better and I am usually fairly content.

Is this a symptom of PAWS? Have I done real damage to my brain that is going to take a while to heal? Or am I just going to be depressed for the rest of my life without any real end in sight?",6,0

Why? The reason why is because I am definitely too young right now to do it, and I don’t want to fuck myself over in the future by doing it. 

When I use weed, The best way I could describe my pattern of usage is that I usually do it on and off, And what I mean is this: I will do it either somewhat heavily or pretty heavily and then get off of it after committing to going cold turkey with it, Then goes by a couple months, maybe even a year or close to a year, and I get back on it, and then I get off of it after committing to going cold turkey. I’ve done this cycle about 2 or 3 times by now. Just including this if it is helpful to put

So, I know that I gotta get off of weed and stay off of it. Thinking about it now, including what I said about the cycle, my biggest trouble now would probably be staying off of it.

So, Any advice?

Mind wants me to smoke to help w the nausea, but I know the reason I am feeling this is because of smoking.

Anyone experience these symptoms from delta 8?

I have my appetite and feel fine.
Just unmotivated to workout or do much of anything on my days off.
I am pretty active but this week since quitting have not gone to the gym. 

I meditate daily which has been extremely helpful. I also read which provides me with something to do instead if thinking about smoking.

I have gone through countless number of vapes. I will buy one smoke it for a day or two than toss it due to guilt. 

Tried to quit multiple times never making it past 2 months. I wasn’t much of a heavy user but deff smoked daily. I am just ready to be done with the hold it has on me. 

This time feels different.

Motivation for me is pregnancy.
My husband and I want to start trying next year and I want to make sure  I do not have weed in my system.

I also do not want to struggle with this addiction while pregnant.

Every minute I spend awake I hate my life. I wake up completely soaked in sweat to the point where my skin is pruney, and I have to lay on a towel and change the towel in the middle of the night. My mood is all over the place. The smallest things send me into a rage and I just feel like I have no control. I can't focus on work or anything. I can barely eat anything. I can feel I'm hungry and my stomach starts to hurt from not eating but I just can't stomach anything and have lost 5lbs this week.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, but I'm pretty sure I have more mental issues than that. This week is probably the worst I've felt in my entire life. I just feel like it's impossible for me to be happy and I've been contemplating if my life is worth living.

I hate almost every aspect of my life. Stuck in an expensive ass city and forced to live with a roommate I hate. Stuck at a job I hate but I have no clue what else I would ever do. I used to have such big dreams and I think I've just realized I'm probably never going to see them become a reality. I decided today I'm going to move back to my hometown by the time my lease ends in November because I hate living with random roommates so much. I have no support system here, can't find a therapist that both takes my insurance and is taking new clients. I don't make enough to live on my own here. I'm pretty much only here for my gf of 6 years who I've been waiting to move in with forever but we've had a turbulent relationship and she owes her parents a lot of money for school so she's choosing to live with them so she can pay them back faster. I don't know what's going to happen to our relationship  when I move. I was already planning on moving to go back to school next year to hopefully take my career in a different direction, but one of my profs still hasn't responded about a letter of recommendation so who knows if that will even happen. 

I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life and I just feel so miserable and the world and humans seem so terrible I just don't know how I'm ever possibly going to be happy. The only thing that makes me feel happy is weed and then I abuse it to the point where I can't even get high anymore. What's the point?",2,0

I still like to do other things, but they always fit *around* my daily weed habit. 

I’m on day 4 of not smoking. 26 years old and smoked almost daily since I was 15 so I knew it was gonna be hard. I expected the depression, the anxiety, the dry mouth. I knew I wouldn’t be able to eat or sleep right for weeks. But I didn’t realize how soon I would notice....other stuff.

What I’m mainly talking about is the loneliness I created for myself. All those nights being content not to go out, not to meet new people, not to try a new hobby or visit a new spot. Weed was my friend for a decade, and it definitely wasn’t all bad. But now that I’m not smoking, I understand the “empty” feeling isn’t just in my head. It’s a physical emptiness that I ignored (and nurtured) every day for the past ten years. 

I have friends in all sorts of clubs, orgs, groups that meet up to do bar trivia and bouldering and night hikes, etc etc etc.  I’m looking forward to doing that stuff too, but for right now I have nothing. Because I spent the last 10 years avoiding growth in favor of the easy way out. 

It’s scary to think about how many opportunities I’ve lost through this addiction, but at the same time I have to turn that around and be excited for all the things I’m gonna get to do now that I’m sobering up and thinking clearly.

I've finally hit the 1 year mark :) yay to me. Things have gotten a little easier, but I found out what I was masking with the marijuana was actually PTSD, so now I'm on the right road to recovery. It took forever to get this figured out. 

If you're struggling after 2 or 3 months of quitting, it may not be withdrawal and there could be something mental going on. After I quit, I was kicked into disassociation and derealization. Every waking day I felt awful, edgy, anxious, nauseated from the constant stress, I didn't know who I was, I didn't even feel right around my kids and my spouse for a long time. I would just cry and feel crazy. Worried I was in some state of psychosis. But then I started doing therapy and we were able to identify that the marijuana was masking some trauma, but eventually was not strong enough to hold it back anymore and it all hit me like a bag of fucking bricks at once. Conveniently it hit me a year after losing my 10 month old son in my arms... PTSD makes total sense. 

Trauma is no joke my friends and it's really easy to mask it with substance. But it's better to let that substance go, face this shit head on and tackle it. I promise you'll stand up a way stronger person than you ever were before. I'm sober off everything. Pot, alcohol and medication I was reliant on. You can be too. You're strong enough.

Many users still enjoy being high - and that's the difficult habit to break.  

I'm lucky in the sense that weed stopped being fun a long time ago - yet I still keep slipping up occasionally.  

The thing is, now when I relapse (for example a very small joint about 2 weeks ago) after a 7 months break, it really seems to do a number on my mental health. 

Whilst high I was super anxious and self aware. 

The next day I felt a really heavy depression coming on (which seems to have lasted 2 weeks).  

My rumination/self doubt/anxiety seems to have spiked the last 2 weeks also.  

It's as if I'm 'allergic' to cannabis now. From all the research I can find, it can only point to an over-active amygdala - something in my brain is triggered by weed (like a hyper-awareness) which seems to take time to settle down. Similar to a gluten intolerant person eating a small amount of gluten.  

My symptoms seem to manifest as depersonalisation which ties in with my theory of the amygdala being 'stuck' on high alert. Of course this is just an anecdotal theory - just wondered if anyone else here is going through the same thing, or whether there's any literacy that I can read for re-assurance.  

I've found a YouTube channel which talks about DP/Cannabis (I seem to tick all the boxes). 

The sad thing is, we're living in a world where Cannabis is being branded as a 'cure-all' and most people I try to discuss this with immediate assume I have 'underlying mental health conditions which are exaggerated by Cannabis' - It's odd that I actually don't seem to have ANY issues when I'm sober (apart from some mild depression/anxiety).

I don't smoke at all anymore). I reduced my dosage because I decided less is more with edibles. Taking about +/- 10mg a day in the afternoon/evening.

I thought ""I'm using less than before and for a smaller duration. No big deal."" I'll probably have a rocky week with some restless sleep and moodiness. I'm on day 19 now and I've been totally unproductive for most of this time. I also have this unrelenting unsettledness inside me. It's like I'm all pumped up but can't do a damn thing. (Also low grade headache, muscle and joint pains.)

I've read many recommendations to exercise, keep yourself busy with projects, hobbies, work, journaling etc. When I read this, I'm thinking how do these people focus and get stuff done in this state? I can get a lot done when I'm on edibles, and a lot done when I'm clean. This withdrawal state puts me in a vice. 

I **finally** got out the day before yesterday and walked 5 miles. Then yesterday walked about 10. I could have kept just going and going but it got late. Although I enjoyed the walks. I don't feel much different.

I was a total shut in before that. I reconnected with someone from high school, he was one of the few I talked with a bit more, which wasn't a lot. So we ended hanging out and hanging with some other people. It helped me by removing inhibitions, and I talked a lot more, and realized it wasn't a big deal, and even sober I found it easier to talk.
It genuinely helped me, it was a fun time but it slowly turned from good to bad. The wasted days, from eating ridiculous amounts of food, and having terrible quality sleep, recovering in the early week and giving in by Thursday and then Saturday and Sunday, sometimes even more days. 
I went to the first party of my life because of it and it was the best thing ever.
But now I can't anymore, it probably has to do with the fact that it became stronger and I started doing a lot more. At first it was a novelty, do I get to do it this week? And it was a fun time if I could. But it became a regular thing. 

Too many wasted days, I have a lot to work on my life, and I've been putting off a lot things that I should be doing. Last time I did it was last Saturday, and I quit on Sunday even though I had the opportunity. That clean day mattered a lot, this whole week was a lot better because I didn't eat days' worth of food and I slept better and my whole week didn't slide like it usually did.

I'm 25 male, and I've smoked since I was 16, to some not much, but to me thats nearly a decade of something I should have never abused.

Basically weed has always been an escape for me, I'm a very quiet lad and my only hobbies included motorcycles, gaming and sitting with my friend smoking. My problems from daily smoking for me is mainly money and mental health, money being the main factor. For years I've always been up to date with bills and content with the fact I basically leave myself no spare money to put towards say a nice car or a nice bike (my bike was pretty old and tatty when i could easily save for better) as long as I had my weed to occupy my time.   
I had another incident which involved losing my license due to drink, please don't judge me on this it was utterly out of character as I dont drink. I also lost my safe contracted job as a ground worker with the best lads I've ever met, anyway now I work in a factory with quite bit less pay, no transport, old clothes and yet I still sit here and I'm puffing away after work and before, no change to save, not bettering myself or progressing its really dawned on me.

I've been on here for a few hours just reading, seeing posts from men of 50 years old saying how they started when I did and should of stopped basically at my age or younger and it really broke my heart reading that and basically seeing life in a different perspective and I just need to change and do.

Tonight at work (on night shift) I've never been so productive and happy to be on my first day of my new life, I'm so absolutely motivated to do this. I'm actually exited so much that even though I could smoke right now (ive quit once before for maybe a month or two but relapsed) the absolute sheer determination to stop and things im going to save for like a nice car is so much more of a dopamine Rush than ive ever had!!!!,!

To top everything off, I got a breakthrough case of Covid at a concert two weeks ago (god forbid I treat myself to a good time, right?) so I couldn’t see my mom in the hospital, and I was forced to quarantine in a windowless basement for 10 days. I’m naturally claustrophobic and the experience gave me panic attacks almost every day, but I decided halfway through that smoking my daily blunt (going on 9 years) wasn’t helping with the respiratory illness or with the rest of my life.

I quit 5 days ago, which was 7 days into the most isolating experience of my life. When I finally got out of quarantine two days ago, I was horrified to learn that my depression didn’t magically recede to its normal level. I was still feeling hopeless and full of despair 100% of the time. After a day of being concerned for my life, I realized that I was just experiencing the classic symptoms of quitting weed, but with the additional weight of the worst week of my life

So im trynna go on my adhd meds but 
the problem is that they counteract with weed

So i have to stay sober for 2-3 weeks first to be able to take my adhd meds.

It’s been 3 dayz only and I’ve been dealing w intense withdrawals(insomnia, wake up soaking in sweat, focus, mood swings, depression,irritability…)

Someone i could talk with when i get intensely emotional, impulsive or just having a strong craving 

Not trynna bother anyone at all just trynna talk and get some insight and experience as to how to succeed.

Found a weird sleepless calm on day 4 -7, sleep improved with exercise. 

Yesterday and today worked really hard, was really irritable with certain people, not everyone. 

After a week of no hunger, I'm starving all the time.  It started after i ate some bread for the first time since quitting. 

I feel kinda stoned, goofy-childish-happy,  positive most times.  

Noticed some gourmet cookies on sale while at the grocery store. 

Stoned me would’ve bought a few boxes. 

I wanted to, but understood that it wasn’t good for me. 

So i bought lots of protein and some spinach.    

Ate a slice of pizza on the way back, drank half a can of soda and tossed the rest. 

Sugar doesn't have a hold over me anymore but,  i seem to be craving food & water all the time. 

Was the first great weather since quitting,  feels like getting high on sunlight.  

Working up a sweat is way more enjoyable now.   Feel kinda high after.  Might be burning the fat stored thc or something.

Now I just feel so extremely bored sober, that I started to focus on my schoolwork more so than before.

The layers and sounds and smells and light are all so much, too much. Grounding myself takes hours or even days sometimes. It physically has me so on edge that I feel my skin crawling and my guts keep turning everything into liquid. I try to focus on one thing at a time, but that only works if the activities indulge all of my senses. 

I would love to know if anyone else has experience with this and how you deal and don't run back to the numbing cloud of ganja.

I’ve been a daily smoker for 15 years. I’ve gone through periods of stopping and starting but it’s been about 2.5 years since I’ve gone a day without smoking. 

Today I decided I’m done. The main reason I haven’t stopped sooner is in fear of what I’m feeling now. 

I just feel pretty anxious, irritable, and teary. I feel like I know the answer to this but I’m not trusting myself right now. When does this get easier? Have other people experienced these same symptoms? Any advice, support, and personal experience is welcomed and appreciated.

I would wake up and smoke and smoke throughout the day until I went to bed and would even take more hits when I woke up during the middle of the night. In April I had my first panic attack after using concentrates for a few months and decided right then and there I needed to stop. During the first few months of quitting I had the regular PAWS symptoms of night sweats, anxiety, nausea, insomnia etc. Since then everything has slowly been getting better. I dealt with some dp/dr for a few months after that, but that has seemed to subside with only a few small bouts of it every now and again. For the last few weeks everything has been feeling ok until a wave of intrusive existential thoughts came over me. Now everyday I start thinking about life and death, my existence, the universe, reality and other basically unanswerable questions. For example,  how the universe has always been there, how it goes on forever, will always be there, how it started In the first place, what happens after death, how I'm alive etc. I'm seemingly hyper aware at the moment. I never had these thoughts while I smoked or even soon after quitting. I can't seem to forget about them and it gives me crazy anxiety when they pop into my head. I never feel fully present anymore because these thoughts are always going on in the back of my mind. It's honestly making me feel more crazy than I already felt.

It's been more than 7 months since I smoked my last joint.

From smoking almost everyday to having no urge to do it. I cannot say it was easy and there were some days were I almost gave up, and told to myself, what would just one joint do?

But in the end, deep inside me I knew that that this one joint was opening the door once again to a lifestyle I was not happy with.

I think to myself that I indulged into this habit because of boredom or lack of hobbies or things to do when I was alone. Also it was a way to cope with loss and grief and numb my feelings.

Once you start replacing this moments with activities like physical exercise or playing an instrument, things where you can actually see some progress, you'll be feeling better with yourself.

During my smoking periods I'd think of days as something that I wanted to get over it, so each day felt like a day less of my life.

Now it feels like everyday I'm working on myself and growing, not wasting my time.

I use the app Grounded to keep track of the days since I do not smoke anymore. I always take a look on it to see how far away I am to that old self and to remind me that all this effort and progression can be gone with the blink of an eye.

In this last 7 months I achieved far more than I expected, I got a job and now got a better one. I could take on a lot of responsibilities and grow profesionally. I also found myself a better place to live and I am in an amazing relationship, something I could have not achieved in 2 years.

This is the longest I've been sober forever! Today felt good, just clear headed, happy and calm. First week was really hard. Lots of cravings, lots of big feelings, feeling really tired/anxious/depressed. so. many. weird.dreams

What helped me:

Running, long walks, yoga and meditation to get back in my body and in the present

Cold showers, long hot showers to reset. Just not overthinking it - get up, get clean, start your day. You got this babe!

Writing thank you cards or calling my Grandma - just thinking about helping others when I get to in my own head,

A few MA meetings and calling fellows when I feel cravings for the support and community.

journaling everyday - 3 pages of freewriting morning pages style to process my feelings. Journaling on why I want to quit and the goals I want to acheive that weed is getting in the way. Getting really clear on my motivation for quitting. 

Treat yourself like a toddler. Healthy food, lots of rest, lots of love. The first 30 days are tough so be really kind and gentle to yourself and don't expect to much or take on super big new goals. Watch a funny movie and go to bed early. Give yourslef sober treats (I like mochas and going to the pool). Just stay sober. That's a huge accomplishment. Piling on too many expectations sets you up for failure.

Reading books/podcast on addiction and realizing there's a spectrum of dependence. For a long time I fell into the trap of well I'm not homeless/unemployed/in jail from my addiction (and I have family members who've been to that stafe of dependency) so I can't be that bad. That thinking kept me stuck and trapped. Even thinking my life is unmanageable (first step in 12 steps) is hard because I still have a job and stable housing etc. It's more that I can't fuck with weed and be the best I can be. I want to be a better version of myself. I want to be of greater service to the world. Weed was keeping me stuck, clouding my thinking and fucking with my ambition. I want more out of life. I want to write a book, travel the world, make art, learn my Indigenous language, just feel clear headed and get high on my supply. That's enough reason to get sober. Not everyone has to hit a scary rock bottom.

Ok thanks! So so so proud of all of you staying sober! It's fucking hard and you're beautiful and I believe in you! Keep going xo",15,0

One thing I realised is that I've been escaping for a very long time. So I wrote a poem about my first escape. Hope you guys enjoy.

I had a friend when I was young,
Who never left my side
They tought me I was more than dumb
For the first time I felt pride 

Screaming matches all damn day,
The house was wound so tight
But my friend and I would play
While the rest of them would fight 

In the cupboard we would pretend
It was the safest place
Though the right word isn't friend
they weren't of the human race 

A dog? A cat? I hear you say
But my friend was not a pet
Although we did like to play.
It was my Lego set.

My mind came up with all kinds of rationalizations:

\- ""I've gotten sober before, I can do it again.""

\- ""Maybe just allow yourself to smoke for a few days and then go back to sobriety. Just a few days!""

\- ""Fuck it, just fuck it. Just do it. Who cares? Life is short. Hurry up and grab before you come to your senses""

The truth is that I've gotten sober many times (and relapsed many times), but getting sober is always SO hard. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. Trying to get off it always makes me feel like crying and I often do. The truth is that it's never just a few days. It always morphs into a several months long binge that I actually want to quit after about a week but just keep breaking promises to myself day after day for months. The truth is that life is short, but it's because it's short that I deserve to get sober and really live a life that makes me happy.

I am SO glad that I didn't allow myself to relapse. The last reason, the ""fuck it just do it"" reason is usually the one that gets me. I can be impulsive and the temptation to smoke can be too much. I was so close and I'm not even exactly sure how I managed to not give in. It felt like the temptation would last forever if I didn't give in, but it only lasted a few days.

What I found helped me:

\- reading this subreddit, reading the desperation from others in their attempts to get sober, remembering how hellish weed addiction is (thank you all for sharing!)

\- reading Quitting Weed by Matthew Clarke. Reminded me of why being sober is what I really want.

\- The most practical thing that helped me: bring that ""I'm just dying to smoke"" feeling into your awareness, and just sit with it, really feel into it and the accompanying sensations in your body, and breathe slowly and deeply. It feels like shit, but when you allow yourself to feel this instead of fighting it or reacting to it, it becomes tolerable - shitty as fuck - but tolerable. Don't fight it, don't try to argue against it, that will just make it get stronger... instead just allow the temptation and the want to have it's space. If you do that it will run it's course and abate in time. Just take it literally one breath at a time, one moment at a time.

Don't give up!!! Keep going!!!

And if you do end up giving in, *be compassionate towards yourself*. This is so important. You're already so hard on yourself. And that's partly why you smoke. You're doing the best you can. Every relapse is another opportunity to learn something about yourself. I had to try getting sober what feels like thousands of times before I could get to the point where I could string a few months of sobriety together. Just don't give up! That's the most important thing.",37,0

I craved smoking for the first 2-3 weeks. Then nothing, until this past week. This past week I craved smoking so badly. Not even to get high, I'm just a weirdo who loved the feeling of harsh smoke being dragged into my lungs. And ugh, I am missing that. 

These cravings seemed to have come from nowhere. 2 months of not craving anything and now this. And it doesn't help that my medical card is still very much active and that I drive past dispensaries that I used to frequent on my way to work every day. 

But I have proven two things to myself these past 3+ months. 1.) I am stronger than I ever thought I was, and 2.) I am happier without weed. I truly am.

Smoking made me anxious, uptight, and short-tempered. My husband and I fought frequently and I could hold onto my anger towards him for days. Of course we still argue but now I have control over myself enough to let that shit go. We argue but we don't yell at each other anymore. When I am upset I don't blow up at him, instead I allow us to have the space and time needed so that we can come back to each other with forgiveness and kindness.

I used to get so mad at my family, for no reason at all. My grandma would call to talk to me and I would feel such irrational anger at being bothered by her. I hated having to take any time from my own life to give anything to anyone. That is gone now.

I have other things to work on to better myself, but I am learning that living a sober life is worlds better for my well-being than the alternative. For the past 2 years I had been hitting 80-90% THC carts from the dispensary, and then in the last few months before I quit I was using an oil rig with my husband, and we were going through 1-1.5 grams of concentrate daily. It was bad. 

To feel this way now, I never thought it possible. And I am happy that I made it this far. I think about it a couple times a week, how grateful I am to myself for this self control I didn't think I had.

So I am absolutely sick of being lazy, feeling anxious, depressed, and awkward around people. It's driving me insane. I have known for a long while I need to stop but always convince myself otherwise, somehow. I've noticed the negative effects it's had on me for years, especially socially. Which is brutal for me as I'm a very energetic and wanting to do thing with friends sort of person. This just debilitates it.

I always say weed is a great drug if you know how to moderate and only do it in certain situations. But, if you're like me, I cannot do that. It will pass over to, oh I'll do it in this once to ease my hangover, or get a little bit for the weekend then get more and more throughout the week inevitably. I'm clearly addicted too it, whether physical or not. I get bored incredibly quick, and this only enhances that when continually going through the motions of ""oh weed will make this less boring, and ease my depression a bit, I just need a little break from my thoughts then I can try to think about stopping"". But then it just makes me more anxious, and worry about the most stupid things, moreover, not getting important things done that would cause me not to worry about these things. Such a cycle. I do have an addictive personality, combined with the situation I am in, my anxiousness, depression, laziness etc, it just is clear to me now that I am addicted to it. Even though it propels all these problems into overdrive in my brain to where I try to forget about everything that's going on, so only makes me feel worse and pushes back the inevitable chores (work, finding a career, sorting my life out).

So what the fuck am I doing? I'm **sick** of it.

The money is extortionate too, I saw another post where a chap was saying you want to do things, but the weed always comes first, so you have to find the money for the event, the money for weed and alcohol, so you just end up not going to the event, justifying it by thinking I will only be boring at the event and think about weed anyway.

I need to get my life together and this drug is massively hindering this. I envy those who can moderate and find good time for it, as when you're done with your tasks for the day and have a clear head, it can be perfect, no guilt. But the guilt of smoking every single day, not doing much productive when I need to find a career and get my life together. Finding a career is really getting me down and has done for years, this perpetual cycle of getting shitty jobs, spending most on weed and not looking for proper jobs because I'm too lazy and it really stresses me out I haven't and can't figure out what I want to do as a career. Weed only makes the stress, anxiety and guilt worse, so I end up trying my best to ignore these issues as I just want one moment to relax and not ruin my 'high'. What 'high'? Feeling anxious, depressed, lazy, guilty and awkward and pondering on when the next one will come. Great buzz that is.

Sorry for going on so long I've never written or done anything like this before so I've waffled a bit and more came out my brain that I thought.

Ultimately, I want to find a way to deal with the process and habit of needing to smoke, but knowing it's not doing me any good. I want to stop.  
 I'd love to know how any of you stopped, and the benefits you saw it had once you did? Also, when life gets brutal how to cope with not wanting to sprint to the bowl or alcohol? As I am quite worried I will substitute the wed for some alcohol, justifying it some how and that only get worse; I've had a few troubles with drugs but weed has just been the consistent daily drag.

I'm just on day 3 and now I'm getting the first crawings. I've tried to quit before and every time it works the same way.

1. I don't have any withdrawal symptoms. Maybe a little more irritable, but since I've often stopped using nicotine, that's no comparison for me. Overall, I feel better, my depressive tendencies are decreasing, I go out more, read, meditate, do sports, etc. Life is changing for the better.

2. I'm feeling better, my overall situation is getting better, but I get a feeling of ""boredom"". ""If I would smoke it would be more fun now"".

""Why don't I actually smoke pot?""

3. ""Everything is great, then I can smoke pot again"". Then I smoke weed, mostly with friends and it's actually fun for the first time, but I slip very, very quickly into old consumption patterns of ""I'll take something with me at home"" and then vape at home. And stop meditating, reading, learning.

I don't want to smoke weed, but I want to smoke it. Quitting smoking weed is easier on the one hand than nicotine and more difficult on the other because it is so ""easy"".

Now I have discovered this community and would like to try to heed as many tips as possible. I like one tip very much, I'll just try not to smoke weed today. Not smoking weed every hour every day is a step in the right direction.",6,0

But weed dulls my emotions drastically. Let me give you a glimpse of what I mean. 

When I am watching a movie, I can choose to either be detached and not shed a tear when something extreme happens or I can let go my emotions flow and even cry like a baby. It is same with people, but much more complicated. 

When talking to someone, I can either hold casual conversation with zero depth. Conversation which doesn't lead to anywhere and is short, even with my closest ones. This is my default setting. Or I can let my emotions flow and this is exactly the moment when I am able to connect with people and suddenly I know what to talk about and it is so satisfying and connecting... 

This is big for me because I have been always very introverted person and I spent the last 8 years in a haze, so I didn't have many moments like this. Superficial friendships also didn't help at all. 

Also, don't look at this in black and white view. It is not ""nothing at all or every emotion at 100% force"" 
It is more like a spectrum. And it depends on situation. But even if I talk to my mom about some casual thing, I can better talk with her while being way more true to how this conversation is making me feel and I am able to communicate it more properly and more ""cleanly"" if you know what I mean.  Also, I think before weed and in my quitting periods, I can be more vulnerable with people which is also a part of this.

Not sure how much this is weed related though. 

When I am toking, those moments are also there, but they are rare, very short-lived and I lose motivation to keep going after a moment like this and conversations then lead nowhere.

Maybe it'll help this time if I write down all the horrific ways this addiction has been taking over my life.

1. I get high without telling my significant other. I admitted it before, promised to never do it again and here I am doing it again. I'm gaslighting him. He recently suspected I was high and I insisted I was just feeling mentally unwell. 
2. I flake so much on friends. I flaked on FaceTiming a friend to see their new baby and haven't spoken to them since. I wonder why my friendships are starting to deteriorate, and yet I haven't been putting two and two together and seeing how many opportunities to strengthen these bonds I passed up.
3. I am playing with fire at work. There are stretches where I take any opportunity I can when I'm not being actively supervised to just get high and play video games while working remotely. I have been high while speaking to important people for important tasks. One time I had to almost drop everything and head to the airport while high. 
4. I don't always pick up calls from kids in my family, who I adore, even when I'm available because I'm high. 
5. I'm writing this while at a conference where I've been getting high every single night after events finish, skipping networking as a result. My supply is out and this is the latest time I'm declaring a new leaf turned, but even I don't buy it.

Even though I look successful and like I have a happy life to outsiders, I know my life is at risk of falling apart if I stay on this path. I'm more than a year alcohol free and know how much better the other side looks. My therapist thinks I should go to rehab, but I just can't bring myself to do it and deal with the fallout at work and in my relationship.

It’s a little better today. I still am nervous and very sad, and feeling SUPER lonely. The guy I’m seeing is out of the country for another two weeks, my few friends I hit up are all busy this weekend. Just gotta remind myself to get through it and this too shall pass. But just feeling like I have no friends, and was largely using weed as my friend and now it’s gone my body is wondering where the happiness will come from. 

Im extra sad. I used to be so content staying in my house playing video games, now I don’t want to and I feel stir crazy - like I can’t stay in here all day anymore. I need to get out. Just going to walk around town for a bit and discover things. I might try going out on the town myself one of these nights, I’ve never been out alone and am scared to do it but it seems exciting.

I stopped weed so I would stop being numb. I didn’t push myself to do uncomfortable things to grow as a person before because I just was comfy and high. After quitting, what did you find happiness in?

I have quit pot before for 6 months (involuntarily) and 2 months voluntarily and want to commit fully after reading about some of the horrendous PAWS experiences folks can have for up to 2 years. I started using habitually when I was 15, and 10 years later, I’m finally over it. Just fed up.

The hard parts are the intense anxiety and depression that are possibly there before I started using but are being amplified in the period of getting off pot. 

I thought marijuana left the system within 30 days? That’s how I pissed clean before. But just because it’s not detectable in the system does not mean it still lives in some sort of cellular memory thing? If I wait 7 years for all my organs to experience cell turnover, will I be able to call myself recovered? 

Also, I’m experiencing other addictive behaviors like porn addiction, shopping addiction and alcohol addiction, which I was raised with. Actually raised with both marijuana and alcohol addiction, even though they were both “functional”

I’m venting, and processing, and I found the urge to share here rather in my journal because I want someone to say that it is worth it to keep going, and that I’m not a bad person for living through addiction. 

I’m trying to get a handle on the other addictive behaviors as well as the anxiety and depression with a variety of means, including meditation, exercise, eating better and sleeping well (my sleep has always been disrupted but it hurts more now).

To anyone that reads this, can I be happy for longer than 15/20 minutes before my anxious and depressed brain take over?

I have only experienced lasting happiness within very specific and structured environments that were unsustainable if I wanted to build financial security and plan for a future where I would be able to support others (kids potentially).

Does anyone else feel like they need to live in a temple to find some peace? 

Thanks for reading. I needed to tell
someone that hitting a milestone like a month is depressing as fuck because in some ways I feel worse than I did when I started, when I was in active addiction, I knew my enemy was using, now my enemy is myself and I know this is a reflection of my failure to process my emotions, but I just want to feel ok, neutral, happy even, but I just feel in pain.

	I’m proud of you for quitting weed, and being sober for the last 30ish days. That is a huge achievement for you, huge. Weed has done such a number on me mentally, and it has taken away my light. But 30 days later, my light is back, my true self is starting to resurface and I’m working as hard on myself as I have ever done. I dont miss it at all, and I must remain vigilant and not to smoke weed for as long as I possibly can, ideally forever. Weed and I do not agree with one another and it takes my already limited potential and limits it even more. 

	The memory loss, the self esteem, the social anxiety, the being fucking dumb, the small, easy, automatic things in life becoming harder, the mastrubation addiction that comes with it as well. My brain chemistry goes so far out of wack and its not worth the “fading” away from life’s problems. Every time you partake in these deeply to the maximum degree instant gratification activities, you take away from your future self. That is the most self destructive and selfish thing you could possibly do. These remainders need to remain prevalent in your life so I can continue to grow. Weed doesn’t have a part in my life right now, and honest probably wont ever again. 

	I’m proud of you man, so proud, you’ve resisted weed in many occasions, especially coming back to college after a 2 year corona haitus and every single person smoking weed. You’ve said no, and they all respect you for it because they know deeply inside them that I’m doing what they should probably do themselves. But remember we are only 1/3 of the way towards our goal, this is both in nofap and in no weed. These 90 days and beyond, I must continue developing myself to become better, figuring out your career, furthering your business, getting stronger and bigger, playing better volleyball, nurturing meaningful friendships, these are all things that you’re currently working towards. 

	You dont have to navigate a fog everyday. A totally garbage and soul sucking fog. Waking up piecing yourself back together from the heavy smoking of the night previous is a problem I no longer deal with. Weed is extremely toxic for your brain. You need to avoid It like the plague brother. You need to get to 90 days to prove to yourself that you can do it. Keep affirming yourself to remain on the right path. You already don’t think about it, everything else is beginning to take priority over remain sober. 

	Good shit so far, let’s continue to elevate. You’ve been working out, but now its time to build a muscle building workout routine. You’ve been eating more, but now its time to up your protein and calories for optimal muscle and energy. You’ve been applying to jobs, but now its time to attend career events and network with this new found charisma and vibration. It’s time for you to get your real estate license, your regular license, a job, more meaningful friendships, and more control over yourself and your time.

This is just the beginning,

I'm currently on day 3 of no weed, and one thing that has been helpful for me is reflecting on the needs that weed is fulfilling in my life, so I can replace smoking weed with healthier activities that also meet those needs. Through research, Tony Robbins has put together 6 basic humans needs that we all have: **Love/Connection, Variety, Significance, Certainty, Growth, and Contribution**

Also according to Tony Robins, if something meets at least 3 of those needs, it has the potential to become addictive (not sure how true this is, but it seems like it can be true).

Just thought I'd share this in case anyone is struggling to find fulfilling activities to replace smoking weed with.

For those that don't know, THC suppresses your REM sleep (the dream part). Other things such as alcohol and caffeine closer to bed time may also suppress REM sleep. The brain knows this and tries to make up for it by having extra REM sleep in subsequent nights. But I think for many of us long-term smokers, we've been suppressing REM sleep for ages, even decades. Unfortunately, not much science has been done on that (because it is illegal in most of the world unfortunately).

I have smoked for the most part of 19 years and very heavily the last 4 years after a 8 month break + relapse. I've never really had sleep issues when smoking, but whenever I missed a day my sleep really suffered. 

For the last 18 days, I've been really curious about sleep and how long it'd take me to get back to ""normal"" (or if I even knew what normal was). I track my sleep with something that measures my Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and my Fitbit. 

*(HRV, at the most basic level, is the variation in time between heartbeats. A high HRV is generally a sign of better health, more relaxation and low HRV the opposite. However, it's more important to compare HRV against yourself than others.)*

So how has my sleep recovered?

* Days 1-6: Extremely variable sleep, some okay, some very terrible. HRV was up and down A LOT. 
* Day 7: By far the worst night of sleep both HRV and Fitbit agree.
* Day 8 - 13: Very slight improvement and rise in HRV, Fitbit mixed.
* Day 14 - 18: More drastic improvement in  HRV and Fitbit best ""sleep scores"" yet (confounded and likely faster improvement by quitting coffee on Day 16).

By day 18 my HRV and Fitbit scores are back to where they were when I was smoking on the better nights of sleep.

Notes: I've not made major changes to sleep habits. However, I'm generally a good sleeper. I did stop drinking coffee on Day 16 (still drinking caffeinated tea), but the rise in HRV was happening before that. However, it does look like sleep improvement increased at a faster rate after that.",1,0

Plus my fitness and weight are way worse. I feel degenerated in every way.

I'm a part time student, so it's only two classes. Theoretically I could recover right now but this stuff still has a hold on me. Plus, I fucked up the whole covid test scheduling thing twice, resulting in my ID not signing me into campus until I test negative again.

For the past 4 years or so I've been telling myself I need to quit smoking weed.  I can't believe I let it get to 4 years of telling myself that same thing - then again it's hard to consciously care too much when I was high all the time. finally, it is happening and joining this group is my first step - thank you for being here.  

When I began smoking, it started as a social thing. Now it has just become a lifestyle - and honestly, I'm not here for it anymore. It has gotten to the point where I have multiple asthma attack daily, and I wake up every middle of the night with a super bad asthma attack that keeps me up for hours.  also chronic bronchitis for years that is resistant to antibiotics now.  I literally don't even feel high anymore after a rip, there is no point in continuing the damage I'm doing and have done. i have known I needed to make this lifestyle change for quite a while, mainly to support my mental health, but always pushed it under the rug.  But, every couple months or so the thought would rise ""it's been another 6 months of smoking every day with no attempt to quit"" and it's hard to not go to an even darker place.  These thoughts have been even stronger lately due to the accompanying physical attributes. yesterday, my psychiatrist made it very transparent to quit.  So THIS IS IT.  This is the start of my recovery. All the time I think about how I've lost who I was. Before smoking weed all the time, I had poor mental health - and now I've succeeded in making it even worse.  Daily weed use for years has left me dissociated from my life and from myself.  It's almost like I truly do not know who I am anymore. I can't remember when weed benefitted my daily life rather than bring about drawbacks.  I go through the motions, but that is it. I'm ready to start living again, start having hobbies and interests again instead of spending every second with the bong.  I'm really looking forward to recovery.  anyway, thanks for listening.",9,0

I figured I would post because I don’t have anyone to talk about this milestone with. I also wanted to share my story for the people who are not feeling great about quitting. 

It has taken me until this point to say that quitting has been worth it. In the past I have written posts about not feeling “amazing” and in love with sobriety. To be honest, I felt annoyed about posts of people raving about how wonderful quitting was. I didn’t/don’t want to bring anyone down for feeling so good in early sobriety, but for me there were no immediate feelings of greatness. 

The problems that brought me to this point take time to work through, and I had to realize it wasn’t going to be a quick fix. I also came to the realization I had to change the way I think. I continue to work on my mental health, personal issues, and manage feelings of wanting instant gratification. Patience is key, and I think most of us have trouble with that. 

Living on life’s terms is difficult. It becomes easier to manage over time, but life’s curveballs can feel overwhelming. Emotions can be overwhelming for a while, but the stability and problems that are solved from quitting are worth it. 

During this time I have started exercising and lost 50 lbs, held a job, created a career path, greatly improved my mental health, and became a semi-functional adult (I still feel like Jennifer Gardner from 13 going on 30 most of the time lol). 

I am regaining my memorization and recall abilities after a year and a half of sobriety. I thought it would never come back, but it slowly is. For the first time two days ago, I was able to tell someone no when offered a bowl without thinking about saying no. It was automatic and felt awesome. I still don’t hangout with people who smoke pot daily because my willpower is not strong enough to be around it all the time, and I think that has really helped.

Just. Keep. Relapsing.

*""It's been a stressful week, you can smoke once a week, it's not a big deal.""*

*""You haven't seen this friend in like 3 whole days, are you just not going to smoke with him?""*

And on and on, it's not that there are any physical cravings it's that every time my brain starts to talk me into it and convinces me its a good idea, or at least not a big deal.

Then I smoke, and it's not even fun, I veg out in bed listening to some podcast going to sleep.

The next day I wake up tired, I don't get the work done that I should get done, I vow to quit again, 2-3 days later the cycle repeats.

I've tried public commitments, I've tried private commitments, I've trade giving money away every time I smoke, but I just keep slipping back into it.

I used cannabis heavily with friends and while in a previous relationship with a heavy weed smoker for periods in my 20s. I stopped for a couple of years until cannabis became legal in my area 3 years ago and decided to buy some. Since then i've smoked weed nearly every night to ""take the edge off"" and i'd smoke in the daytime on weekends when I had bad days.

 I'm a social worker by profession and I started smoking weed to cope with extra hard days which turned into needing to smoke every night to go to sleep, which turned into isolating myself in my apartment to smoke weed after work and having no self care methods whatsoever except smoking weed and binge eating. It was really really bad, especially when the pandemic hit - I was living on pure survival mode and honestly I don't know how I survived that. I left my CPS job in December due to burnout for a job roughly in my field, that's less demanding and requires significantly less responsibility, to fix my mental health. My mental health has improved since then and while I consider myself wayy more high functioning than I was, I still struggle with depression. 

I fully believe chronic weed smoking exacerbated my burnout, especially when the pandemic hit as I was in my apartment more so I smoked more. I've been smoking weed to go to sleep on bad mental health days which turns into smoking it every night. 

I can see this cycle happening again, i'm tired of living like this, and I need to quit to appropriately address my depression. Whenever I stop for a week I feel better and then I get triggered by a stressful day or an argument in my relationship (these are what most triggers me to go back to smoking weed) and I go right back to needing to smoke. Weed has caused me to neglect my hobbies, physical health, and relationship. Also, I want to do more frontline social work jobs but I know I can't competently sustain a career I love until I get a handle on my weed habit. So my first day is today. 

If anyone has any pointers on motivation, and adding structure & discipline in one's life, I would really appreciate it. I wrote down reasons to quit and hung it on my wall beside my bed so I can see it when I wake up. This motivated me to actually post here instead of lurk lol",2,2

Being able to take in a big breath of fresh air is honestly priceless, and it’s helped my anxiety so much. Before it felt like there was a film or screen or something causing the air not to be absorbed right, but now that they’ve cleared themselves up and I can take big breaths it give me a little relief. Yawning actually makes me tired. I’m not as winded or sweaty all the time. 

That 2 month relapse messed me up so badly both physically and mentally that I think this time is really it, I can honestly say this is the first time I’ve stoped and not had the slightest urge to return to it.

Truth is, these little smoking holidays where you tell yourself it’ll only be a couple weeks or a month, they have consequences too. When you get to the point where it becomes an addiction, it *will* quickly cause you to return to your bad habits and mindset. And if you somehow stick to the plan and quit after your allocated time, you’re sure as hell going to withdrawal. 

Such a great, but strange plant. It’s a shame I ruined it for myself. But I like being present and living a fulfilled life, it’s enough for me. I’m getting there one step at a time.

It’s interesting to see whom amongst my friends have put two and two together regarding how much I’ve grown the last couple years. Some people think they are friends with you but are really just friends with their idea of you, sometimes they aren’t even talking *to* you but to their idea of you. It’s actually pretty odd to notice as you mature and grow as a person and they are just too busy in their lives (or lack of) to notice. The friends who do notice are the keepers, the others clearly just aren’t that interested or are too stuck in their own heads. But that’s okay, no need fo burn bridges. Casual friends are good too, unless that’s all you have, then it turns into a problem.",9,0

Before I started smoking I was incredibly social. Weed turned me into an introvert zombie and I just want to go back to how I used to be. Quitting is just so agony. I can’t stop thinking about how much time I’ve wasted and what I could have have achieved by now. I can’t stop feeling guilty for indulging in that boring high every single day and I can’t stop hating myself for it. I would have had so many more friends if I didn’t blow people off to get high. I would have had so many more experiences. Before I smoked I loved going out with friends, but since smoking I’ve blown people off almost every single time. These thoughts are in a loop and they make me depressed. Everyday I want to smoke again to forget about how much I hate myself for what ive inflicted on myself. 
I can’t sleep at all, every sleeping tablet doesn’t work. Does anyone have tips for sleep?

my addiction started there, and i started smoking more and more, eventually smoking at least everyday, in the morning, afternoon and at night. I would frequently tell myself i could quit anytime i would like too, and never thought of myself as an addict. Until recently i started having severe stomach issues, and was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, and spent a total of around a week in the hospital throwing up, wrenching and falling dehydrated almost everytime i wasn’t hooked up to IV. 
this opened my eyes and made me realize i am an addict, and i couldn’t just quit like i said i could. im on my fourth day sober today, and god, i realized how much weed ruined my teenage years. 
im turning 18 next month, all my peers are off too college and uni, im stuck in high school still taking 12B. because i let weed hold me back from attending, it made my anxiety and paranoia worse. im stuck with a shitload of schoolwork, it’s just making everything worse. 
the anxiety from school, as well as all the symptoms from quitting, and all the recent hospital visits is just making life hard right now. i came into this group looking for support and to meet people in similar situations as me, and i really hope you all can be by my side for this journey. im gonna need all the support i can get right now. thank you to anyone who read my paragraph, i appreciate you so much.",6,0

I’ve been smoking every day (minus a couple of week-long breaks here and there) for the past year and a half. I started after the pandemic started, which I’m sure a lot of people did. It got me through a lot of stressful times, but I recently came to terms with the fact that it started doing more harm than good. I was spending way too much money and smoking way too often, at least for my personal standards. Felt like I was missing out on life and valuable time with my fiancé. I was frustrated by my lack of control. If it was in the house, I’d smoke it until it’s gone, and then get anxious when I ran out. 

The first week of sobriety went pretty well. I was hopeful for the future, hell-bent on kicking the habit for good. But now I keep thinking to myself “maybe if I just take a long break and try going back to it, I can have a much healthier relationship with weed and develop good habits.” Am I wrong for thinking this way? It provides so many genuine benefits for me. I feel like I owe it to myself to give it another shot. I am staying sober until at least the new year. This semester of college is very important for me and I can’t afford to fuck it up by smoking and losing all my motivation. Alternatively, if the supplement I ordered for myself provides the anxiety and stress relief I need, then maybe I can stop weed for good. Sorry if this is unorganized and hard to understand. I just needed to share my feelings with folks who will get how I feel. Some input would be nice too. Has anyone successfully taken a long break and then developed healthier smoking habits afterwards?

I discovered r/leaves just a few days ago, just as I reached the first really tough time in my journey. 

I've spent the last 2 days reading about other people's experiences, posting about my own and reading & responding to replies. 

The feeling I have as I scroll through the comments and messages is hard to describe. 

I feel like I'm not alone and I have a whole community of people going through what I am, who I can confide in, support and receive support from.

WOW! 

I just want to spread some love and say thank you to each and every person who has posted, read my posts, read other people's posts, inspired myself, others and themselves. 

What an unbelievable group of people we are!

SENDING LOVE, PEACE, HUGS AND GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE. I DON'T KNOW YOU, BUT I LOVE YOU ALL! ♥

I have one month and 24 days, I’m really proud of myself for doing the work, and I feel infinitely better than when I was smoking.  I’ve progressed more as a person in these 7 weeks than I did in the 3 years I spent high. 

So, I have been intentionally avoiding all of my hardcore stoner friends to resist temptation, but tonight I invited a few to my Mabon (pagan harvest holiday) dinner celebration. It’s like 3 out of the 8 people coming i’m worried about. I told them in advance if they want to smoke to please do it far away from me, everyone says they totally get it and will respect that. They are good people who care about me but have way worse weed problems than I ever did, I am worried that their relationship with the plant will ultimately be prioritized over our friendship (been there).

My partner and best friend said they will help enforce that boundary and help me resist temptation if need be. I’m hoping the group situation with mostly nonstoners will make it easier. I’m just very concerned about backsliding and losing all of the progress i’ve made. 

Any advice on how to safeguard more would be much appreciated! Blessed be to anyone celebrating the autumn equinox 🧡🍂",3,0

Man, dependency is so insidious. I've always been a lightweight, and I've even had problems with weed making me anxious to the point I always refuse to smoke with company. But I always told myself smoking a little before bed, or sometimes before eating, or on the weekends before gaming, was no big deal. I even thought of it as good for me at times. Good for my anxiety occasionally and all that built-up muscle tension. Good for sleep and appetite. But I didn't think I needed it. I 100% thought ""I could quit if I wanted to."" 

Well, I barely slept last night. Even if I'm extremely hungry, every time I eat, I feel nauseous before, during, and after. I've had headaches, I've been tired and out of it and desperate for just a puff to feel better. I even think my focus is suffering. 

I initially thought I would just take a break, but I'm starting to wonder. Why would I go back and do this again? What if this habit is really holding me back in life? Because it feels like it is. I don't feel sharp, I don't feel motivated, despite desperately wanting to do so many things. I really hope I can break out of this fog, and start living and learning fully.",11,0

I am ready to start living again.,"I am turning 34 in a couple of weeks, and I have been a daily smoker since I was 17. I can't really remember the last period that my smoking has improved my life in any way, and now I am at a point that I can see clearly how damaging this plant has been for me over the years. I feel like I am an empty shell of what I once was. I have lost touch with most of my friends, stopped doing the things I once loved, and no longer have any hobbies or interests.

My early years of smoking were great. Lots of fun times, laughs, it helped me grow my social network in college since I always had something to do and some way to relate to other smokers. Me and my roommates were selling weed for a couple of years, and we had the party house where everybody was always hanging out. Even though it was somewhat beneficial to my social life during this time, I also went to a large portion of my college classes stoned, and I feel like I got very little out of my experience compared to what I could have.

I am a fairly introverted person, so making friends was never my strong suit. Pairing that personality trait with a decade and a half of being stoned all the time has been detrimental to my social life. I made excuses not hang out with friends to instead smoke and sit on my ass so many times, that nobody even bothers to reach out to me anymore. I smoke and then am awkward and paranoid, and become agoraphobic, not wanting to leave my house and risk having to interact with people. There were a couple places that I lived where I was the roommate who stayed in his room smoking weed all day.

The past 5 years have been the years of my heaviest use. Most weekends I was stoned from the moment I woke up to the time I fell asleep, and always got stoned immediately once I got home from work or on my commute home. I have even been getting high more and more at work. Often smoking before my commute, and then sneaking off at lunch with my vape pen. It was clear how much less productive it made me, made me anxious and awkward to talk to people, made me put off important tasks and ignore emails and phone calls. It also really prevented me from making good connections with my co-workers. The more and more I would fall behind, the more stressful my job got, and the more I relied on weed to ""de-stress"", and the cycle would repeat. I quit a couple of jobs thinking I hated them when really I might have just been too stoned to realize how good I had it, and too stoned to get into a groove and be happy. Once COVID hit, and I was working from home full time, I was also stoned whenever I didn't have a meeting that I was expected to talk in.

I thought that smoking weed helped numb myself from small issues I was experiencing in my life, but really, it just numbed me to life in general, and caused more problems than it solved.

The only significant break from weed I have taken was in the summer of 2013. This was probably the best time of my life. I had an active social life, I was ingrained into my community, I was motivated at work, I taught myself to play ukulele and spent my weekends doing things I loved with people I cared about. I remember easing back into it, smoking occasionally with friends, but soon after, descending back into full-on addiction, smoking at every chance I could get. I have tried to take many ""breaks"" over the years, that rarely lasted more than a few days, and often ended with me scraping an old gross pipe to take resin hits and scouring my apartment for any weed crumbs that may have fallen under the couch. I have proven to myself time and time again that I cannot maintain a healthy relationship with weed and just smoke casually on the weekends. I always end up right back where I started, if not worse.

Yesterday was my first day without weed, but I feel like this is a turning point for me. The catalyst for the start of my current journey is that I recently started having significant problems with my girlfriend for the first time after 6 years of being together.  She is the love of my life and I want to marry her soon. She says that I am closed off to her and she is having a hard time connecting with me, which is 100% correct and 100% my fault. How am I supposed to maintain a meaningful connection with somebody when I am in a stoned daze all the time? I have taken her for granted and given her far less than she deserves for far too long. I cannot let me unhealthy relationship with a plant that I don't even really enjoy consuming ruin the best and last thing I have going in my life.

I am very happy that I stumbled upon this community. I spent hours reading through other people's experiences yesterday, and it is empowering to know that there is such a large community of supportive people who have parallel experiences to my own.  I wish you all the best on your own journeys to take you lives back, and I hope that I can bee successful and help others along the way.",158,1

Yesterday I smoked my last joint.
I first smoked weed when I was maybe 14. By the age of 16/17 I was smoking regularly with friends. I’d have intense white-outs and be paranoid as I was still living with my parents (who knew I smoked at this point but massively disapproved). I’d say between the ages of 16-19 I was smoking maybe 2 or 3 times a week.

That changed when I went to uni. By my second year I was smoking more or less every day, and unequivocally every day by my third year. This led to me having to resit my final year twice. This brings us to 2020/2021 where I’m smoking more weed than I’ve ever smoked in my life. I ruined a relationship with an amazing woman and this was without a doubt due to the anxiety and paranoia caused by my usage. I’d convinced myself I wasn’t good enough for her and I pushed her away to the point where, after 2 or 3 chances, she had to break up with me. I’m still getting over that relationship and it’s been a year and a half - longer than the length of the relationship itself.

I’m 25 years old and I’m not going to let the latter half of my 20s be dictated by this drug. I have ambitions that I’ve let sit on the back burner while I’ve watched my peers do some of the things I know I can do. I’m a pianist; I’m an aspiring parkour athlete; I’ve just started trying to work on my tennis game.

I have a lot of gratitude. I’ve seen a friend or two “lose themselves” to this drug after only a year or two of heavy usage at the age of 17/18. For the most part I think I’m still mentally sound, and I think a lot of the anxiety and paranoia would start to diminish after a matter of months.

I’ve had so many of these moments where I decide I’m taking action. I’ll throw away my paraphernalia, delete my dealers’ numbers. However, I’ve never posted here before. And I’m posting because honestly, Reddit, I’m shit-scared, and I need your support. Only because of those first few days where there’s no telling if you’re going to relapse or not. I know I’m going to have trouble sleeping, intense dreams when I do manage it. I’m going to feel like something is missing for at least a week probably longer. I know I’m going to be irritable as I’ve experienced it before. However, I’m going to find stability and I’m going to be the best version of myself. I just want to make my parents proud and be happy with who I am.

Thanks for reading, guys. I’m starting my personal day counter now and I’m really looking forward to diving into this community and seeking solace in the stories of others when the going gets tough.

Thanks for the ride, weed. I’ll take it from here.

All the best guys,

As in; if you’re creative on your own, but it get suppressed by smoking, now that you stopped you can’t discover that side of your being/that talent of yours to the fullest. Because of the big dopamine hits smoking rushes to your brain you get numb to other things that used to give you dopamine as being a little child. No wonder teens lose their interest in playing music, arts and other hobbies. All they do is rush in to new dopamine hits everywhere. It suppresses your true identity and your own wants and needs, it makes you comfortable with less because your brain is already satisfied with dopamine everyday.

I found this out after 3 weeks of stopping. You need to find other natural activities to give you dopamine because the brain craves it!

I would get stoned and eat a box of cookies and pass out at night when smoking.

Eating clean made a huge difference on my emotional state. 

Last night I actually felt hungry at dinner. 

Sticking to mostly veg, clean meats & unprocessed/pesticide free food.  

The GREAT NEWS:
Felt tired early, so i went to bed early. 

 I slept 4.5 hours straight and then another 2.   Best sleep I’ve had in a while.. 

I had DREAMS!  And they weren’t terrible. 

No night sweats. 

Im tired this morning like I woke up in the middle of a rem cycle, still managed to do a few more exercises than normal. 

Having a short temper with management at work for abuse of coworkers is becoming evident.

Now that I am the wrong side of 40, and my friends and peers have ascended to the highest heights (no pun intended!) in their various careers and pursuits, I have finally realised that this has never been the case. Seriously, some of my friends and family are a HUGE deal.  There was a Vice article a while back that said that for every Snoop or Willy Nelson, there are 9 others whose failures in life can be directly traced to the herb. That's me.

Weed is so subtly damaging, it creeps up on you and one day you're 43 and life has not gone anything like you thought it would when you were a bright-eyed teenager who'd been given the best possible start in life.

The pandemic/lockdown obviously hasn't helped, at the very beginning I was almost excited - this was a chance to take smoking and the rest to its logical conclusion, i.e. do it all the time. Picking up weed, hash & carts, and on trips to the supermarket, I was like a kid in a sweet shop. My credit cards hate me now by the way, there's another issue right there.  

I'm 3 and a bit weeks off weed now, and while I know it's obviously the right thing to be doing, the revelations that sobriety is uncovering are why I'm here.

So what now? This is what is currently scaring the shit out of me...this realisation that my life has been spent a slave to a plant that, frankly, I thought was my friend. IT'S MY FAULT. Like others here have said, for years I've not been getting high-high, just constantly topped up to take the edge off life. May as well have been wrapped up in cotton wool.

I should have smoked (if at all) for one year max, from when I discovered it aged 17, to sometime during that first year at Uni when I realised how it was affecting me and how it was taking over my life. Better still avoided it completely, but hey, I wanted to be cool (FFS).

I have somehow managed to end up happily married with two beautiful children - my wife, who is 8 years into AA recovery, is a life-saver. She's never been judge-y about it but has deserved better. Now that I'm finally trying to give her better, the knowledge that I managed to basically waste the most important 25 years of my life is haunting me day and night.

I'm sorry that this is disjointed, and I've gone on a bit, obviously my brain isn't what it was 25 \*\*\*\*ING YEARS ago...Thank  you if you've read this far, and thank you to everyone who posts here. Just knowing you're not alone is so powerful.

I was eloquent, bright, ambitious, full of potential. I have ended up none of those things. It's just, what have I done? What have I DONE?

PS I'm seeing a lot of posts - even today and in the last couple of days - from people at a similar age and realisation as me. Just wanted to say I'm glad to be not alone, and glad to tell you you aren't either. Right, now to pull myself together and get back to work.",498,2

This is my first post. After lurking the sub for a few months, the bell finally rang for me too. I quit weed on Sunday night. I smoked for over 20 years from my late teens till age 40. I have to say, weed has been a companion, that I relate to many good times. I am grateful for that. Being high felt really nice. Being high helped me go through difficult times. Regrettably, there have always been downsides. 

Apart from lung health, my biggest gripe about smoking weed was not being able to fully concentrate, not being in possession of my 100% cognitive capacity. I have always smoked moderately, I would say half a joint a day is an accurate account. And of course, there have been times with no weed at all. My problem is that I cannot possess a stash of weed without smoking a little bit, no matter what. 

So basically I developed what I thought was an organized life to help me cope with the lack of concentration. I haven’t done too bad, I love my job, I love my girlfriend, and I have many dreams that I wish to accomplish.

Finally, I said this is enough. I understand and accept everyone who smokes, it’s just not making it for me anymore. That feeling of being high, which has defined my life in so many ways, has finally fallen off the pedestal.

Three months ago, I ditched tobacco, I wasn’t a heavy user, but definitely a constant one. I used the Smoke Free App. Now I reset the App and I am using it for counting my days without weed.

I ain’t feeling any immediate withdrawals, actually, I am feeling a little relief as I desired for so long to have a clear mind. But I know cravings will come, in the summer, when things are going alright when there’s no pressure, I will probably feel the call from weed again. It is my hope that I will be able to focus on other things, that I will learn to get pleasure from other sources in life.

I have decided to walk to the r/leaves path. Thanks for the inspiration to everyone on this forum. Wish me luck :)",12,0

Today it's been 90 days i quit smoking weed and more than a year without cigarettes.,"Feeling very proud of myself. And grateful that i realised that smoking weed was actually making me feel down and anxious than before. I was thinking that it was helping me. But boy, was i wrong. I got so used to smoking that for most days i used to smoke in the afternoon and stay stoned the whole day. Lost a lot ot of time and now i am very happy that i gave up and now i have time to do the things that i truly want to do. I am getting back to be a normal and clear mind. I can think clearly now. I can focus better. And my mood is way better than before. That being said, i still do feel agitated sometimes. Still trying to learn patience in situations and also patience with people. 

It's worth it. Smoking weed we just remain in the comfort zone and remain complacent. Leaving it makes you realise that it's been actually holding you back in life.

Edit: it's been 10 months plus without cigarettes. Not a year:) i thought it was already a year lol.",92,0

As I’m sure many of you know, addiction is heavily influenced by genetics and heredity. Biologically, the pain/pleasure center of your brain releases dopamine whenever you do something that it deems “good” for survival. This is a primal instinct that was used to keep our ancestors safe way back when. When someone takes drugs, it boosts the dopamine in their brain significantly more than doing other “good” things (going for a walk, eating a nice meal, etc). This tricks your brain into thinking “wow, this must be really good for survival! So we’ve gotta keep doing it!” So even if you know logically that drugs aren’t healthy for you, biologically your brain believes it’s something you need to do for survival. That primal instinct has taken over, and this primal part of your brain biologically cannot “logic” it’s way out of addiction. Willpower often isn’t enough, and medical/clinical intervention (meds, therapy, etc) is often required to help rewire your brain. 

Addiction is not a choice. It’s not a moral failing. While no one is responsible for your sobriety but you, struggling to quit (or even getting addicted in the first place) does NOT mean that you’re weak, pathetic, a loser, etc.

I feel so disconnected and detached from everything and everyone around me. I have doubts about everything, I over think and once anxiety comes through it’s game over for the day lol. ( I say lol because humor is how I cope) 

The first week was rough, I had pretty bad anxiety and the second week was better I felt like I could do everything and more. Now onto the third week I just feel so confused, stuck and disconnected. An hour ago I had the thought of how easier life would be if I just didn’t exist for a minute and then I snapped out of it. Crazy thing is I’ve never had thoughts like that so is that just withdrawals?

All of that ^ plus post grad anxiety I think is the reason why I just feel like crap right now. Im aware this feeling isn’t forever and that things will get better but damnit wtf this withdrawal process is ass.  

Currently feeling like that meme of the dog that’s sitting in the middle of the room that’s on fire, “everything is fine” LOL

To end this vent/rant on a positive note, I just want to say whether you’re thinking about quitting or you already did.. be easy on yourself and don’t forget to laugh.

I was an all day every day smoker and I used it to avoid the realities of life; job, university, health, relationships, and so on. I was doing really well, until last night, I had a super vivid dream where I snuck out and smoked with a mate, then got into an argument with my parents when they noticed I had fallen back into old habits. Suddenly I had that deep craving when I woke up in the morning and was sooo close to buying more. But instead I spoke to my dad, had a bit of a breakdown and a cry, and I feel infinitely better now. It seemed hopeless, the feeling overtook me but we persevered. I believe that all of you can do the same no matter what! The relief I feel now is far better than what it would have been had I stupidly relapsed. I also realized in the same breakdown that although I've been exercising and eating better, I need a job, or a purpose, something more meaningful to take up more of my time. Otherwise next time this happens I won't be so fortunate. Even with the emotional onset the dream brought on, it is really great to dream again and I believe they are very important in my processing of the emotions of the day.

I hated how I would have to rush to get stuff done in the day, because the evening and night were for smoking. I hated the way I avoided people at night. I was a closet smoker, so no one knew. I hated wondering if my kid would have an emergency, and I wouldn't be able to drive to the emergency or might not know the proper quick response. 

I hated feeling locked in for the night. Need to go grocery shopping? Can't do it, I don't drive high. Want to get something to eat? Have to spend more money on ordering in. And forget about cooking, I just want to sit on my butt and do nothing. So I would eat garbage and ALWAYS gained weight when I smoked and slack on exercise. 

Smoking after not smoking for a while is also bad. I would get high again after a while and think, this? THIS is what I was thinking was so great? I'm foggy headed and nothing seems funny. It takes a while to get used to high things again. A complicated, mind-bending movie? Nope, to tough to follow. I could watch a show I normally like. No, too slow, what else can I watch. 

Oh and don't even think about reading a book, my mind wanders or it is just something I feel is too boring to do. 

Also the hiding. Uh oh, it's a phone call you have to take, but you're high as a kite. Can they tell you are high? Oops, they were just telling a whole story and I drifted away in the center of it, now i'm lost. 

Does this room smell? Got to hide my stash. I hope I hid it well enough. 

UGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH! I never want to feel those things again. 

Weed isn't that great for me. I feel an attitude shift, I get less patience with outside things. I just want to go home and smoke out and veg out and stuff my face. 

I do laugh more when not high. I'm still my dorky self, and I can think better and go anywhere. I could leave to the store right now and it's 9 pm. I'm done with weed. It's one of those bad relationships that I can't have. If it works for you and you don't feel bad on it, more power to you.

Maybe I can create this for myself by taking off from work and getting an AirBnB cabin in the woods with good wifi for two weeks. Schedule it all out like I'm designing my ideal rehab program. Two sessions a week online with my therapist. Maybe I can find a separate substance abuse counselor to meet/talk with in addition. An online recovery meeting every day. A yoga class every day. A Zoom hangout with a friend or two each day. An hour a day for journaling and/or doing a workbook. A modest hike every day.

At 80 days sober, I'm here to tell you a few things I've learned along the way. 

I was someone who smoked for 9 years before I got to the point where I just couldn't take it any more. I decided I would stop again on the 1st of July. I say again because this is my 5th attempt and I want to tell you to not give in to the negativity of going back to it to only quit again. It doesn't matter how many times you've tried to quit. The strength you have to give being sober another try increases every time. It might not be noticeable, but you really do have that belief in yourself that you can overcome this. 

What makes this attempt different from my other attempts was that I really wanted to see who I was without it. I smoked from the age of 16 to 25. I didn't have any idea how I would be and feared the worst. I thought that all my negative traits that I had suppressed for so long would take over and that my mental health would be more severe that it's ever been, but with the further I get into being sober it feels like I'm coming out of this dark tunnel that I've tried to get out of for so long. Wherever you are in that dark tunnel, keep going. You will get past the withdrawal symptoms, the doubts and the fears. They are only things that your mind wants to distract you with to keep you in its grip.

I believe in every one of you who are on this journey to being free from cannabis that you will succeed and I'll tell you why. I've had little to no support with quitting and I still live with my Dad who still smokes it. So, how have I been able to do it? Wanting to get better has been the biggest motivator for me. I didn't want to be stuck repeating the same situations, never making progress in my life. I have a severe hatred for 'the same things'. I couldn't stand to repeat the same thoughts, same behaviours or have the same beliefs that I had always had. I wanted to become a better version of myself and becoming sober has allowed me to break free from all of that. 

I have also challenged my beliefs and perception about cannabis and been able to change them. I would say though that this is something you'll be able to do further into recovery, but don't be discouraged, you got this! Remember!? I was able to change my beliefs and perception by learning more about how cannabis really affects the brain. I went back to what caused me to start smoking in the first place and came to a new perspective about it. I discovered that I could eat and sleep without cannabis and most of all, I learned that I could face the things that I had tried to avoid for so long. 

Now at 80 days, my life is finally going in the direction that I want it to and I'm becoming a better version of myself. I'm waiting to get my own house. I have new ideas about how I want to live my life. I want to be a writer and have been able to get back to studying and writing my own stuff. I'm improving in ways that I hadn't been able to for so long. I'm going to make new friends in real life and really start living.

I also felt nausea creeping in during the evenings and decreased appetite. My anxiety and depression have been heightened to the max. I spent all day yesterday in bed contemplating suicide.

I've always had difficulty falling asleep, I'd often spend hours tossing and turning. Quitting weed has made me nap so much during the day because I seem to fall asleep alot faster. At night, I have vivid dreams (often nightmares) and I'm waking up at least twice throughout my sleep in sweat.

So far it's been a pretty grim journey and I feel like I haven't gained much out of quitting aside from improved brain fog. I went to a doctor yesterday because my mental health has been deteriorating for many reasons and I think some symptoms of PTSD have creeped up from a sexual assault that happened in 2019. Due to the ongoing lockdown, mental health services in Melbourne are being swamped and I'm anticipating the waiting lists for psychologists and psychiatrists to be absolutely fucked.

I'm truly at a breaking point and haven't felt lasting positive emotions in so long. Covid has taken so much from my life - from everyone's lives. I really don't know how much more of this I can take. I often think if I was offered a painfree suicide pill I'd take it in an instant.

TLDR: Smoking since 15, almost 21 now. Experiencing nightmares and waking up in sweat every night, abysmal sleep quality in general, nausea, decreased appetite, heightened anxiety and depression and possible PTSD that was masked from daily smoking. Stuck in Melbourne lockdown due to COVID and don't know what to do.",6,6

Alot of times I identify with the desire for that result - being clean (for more than two weeks )

I want to genuinely ask every one of you redditors that have achieved months and years and decades of sobriety - what was your ""tipping point""? 

What made you end it all? What was happening in the moment you made that decision and haven't smoked since? 

I'm genuinely curious, maybe sharing all these stories in the comments (hopefully it happens) will help many people on their journey of sobriety.

And why now after so long?
I'm 43 years old. I've been smoking daily since age 17.
I've never been sober as an adult.
I spent my life until now smoking grass, smoking cigarettes, eating unhealthy and drinking alcohol daily. 
I was never interested in exercise or sport.
I'm married, I have 3 beautiful children and I've always worked hard.
But my life has been far away from what it could or should be.
I've always known that, but didn't know how to break the cycle. 
4 years ago I had a horrific car accident. Although I'm now partially disabled, I'm lucky to be alive and able to walk.
That's what made me start to appreciate things and motivated me to turn my life around. 
Quitting alcohol & cigs was hard but manageable. 
Losing weight, learning about healthy eating and lifting weights is enjoyable. 
Quitting grass was always going to be the hard one.
I finally went for it and I'm now on day 35.
It's not easy but I have my reasons to keep at it.
This forum has been a great source of help and support for me.
I read about many if you quitting after 3, 5, 10 years of smoking. 
I've put up a couple if posts so far and got a couole of replies from people quitting after 20+ years. But not many.
I'm just wondering how many of us are out there; guys who have allowed the gange to dominate such a large portion of their lives. 
If there are many others, what were your reasons and motivation for packing it in after so long?

I used to have really bad sleep paralysis when I was 15 right before I started smoking it, things like waking up to my grandparents trying to murder me and a reoccurring shadow-wendigo that used to haunt me. Smoking seemed to fix that and make me happy so I just kept going with it.

Either way, I'm 30 at this point, smoked heavily to a point where I realized I don't even know who I am or what my identity is. My personality was essentially being a stoner, that's what everyone knew me as.

Fast forward to today, I finally had my first dream in what feels like over a decade. It was more lucid than any dream I've ever had, and involved me living the next 4 years after making a decision I have to make in the next year about where to live. I realized so much about myself, and it was so intense I thought it was real until the very end where I spotted a celebrity in a crowded lunchroom.

I'm still processing it, but I'm so glad that it happened...I feel like I learned so much just from being able to dream again. My point is, don't give up on quitting, focus on yourself and the motivations for not wanting to go back will eventually make sense.

Been smoking now for 15 years. I’m almost 29 years old. I seem to have lost everything over time, not directly because of weed but definitely indirectly. After reading some posts on here (very helpful) I realised that for the longest time now I’ve been comfortable in my way of living and completely lost my desire to progress as a human being. I can’t seem to do much of anything anymore apart from go straight home after work to smoke. When I was a young kid I was so charismatic and confident and over the years that all just vanished. I tell myself I smoke to deal with the pain of a traumatic upbringing and it’s the only thing that helps me unwind. I’ve lost all my friends due to not accepting any invites to do stuff, opting instead to stay in and smoke! I now know that by medicating myself like this I’ve missed out on so much! My twenties went by in the blink of an eye and I pretty much did nothing apart from stay in and smoke and game whilst losing countless friends. The best years of my life. Gone. But now for the first time I’m actually aware of all this and I’m not making excuses anymore. I really want control over my life again! More than anything.. I want to do the things I’ve dreamt of doing.. I want to feel alive again finally. But I am completely alone and have absolutely zero friends and family and I’m really struggling to quit (or find the right method I guess). I guess I just need advice from you guys?

On the bright side I do feel really free from it, not having to plan my days around when I can smoke. At night I often feel super bored and want to cave but then the next day when I don’t smoke  I feel really proud of myself and that serotonin lasts longer than 1 hour high to binge eat and fall asleep.

I can’t accurately remember where I’m at in terms of a timeline, I’d say around 16/17 months? Give or take. As some of you might remember I came onto this sub when I was at an early 60-70 days free, & my PAWS had just set in around this time. 

For those of you who MIGHT be dealing with PAWS, I can report to you that things get periodically better. It’s extremely true what they say, it can take 1-2 years for most cases of PAWS to begin clearing up, & an average 2-3 years for more stability to settle into every day life after this experience. I dealt with a hell of a ride for well over 12-14 months. I’m now starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, seriously. 

To list a few of my symptoms that I had for 12-14 months, I experienced:
•dizziness
•malaise
•sleep disturbances
•anxiety
•depression
•migraines
•muscle aches/discomfort
•visual snow/floaters
•tinnitus
•blurred vision
•fatigue
•mood swings
•heart palpitations
•muscle twitches

This is just a fragment of a whole lot of symptoms I experienced almost daily-to-weekly during those months. It was difficult trying to keep up with life, but the more you go through it, the easier you will make it out down the road. To be honest, I experience at least 1-2 random symptoms every other 3-4 weeks, & each month I experience huge breakthroughs now. Friends & family around me tell me I look healthier & they notice I’m becoming myself again. This is huge for me. I feel at least 95% there. 

My advice to everyone is to find hobbies, be social, make healthier decisions, put yourself first & prioritize YOURSELF. None of this is easy, PAWS or no PAWS. I went through all of it. It feels like you’re stuck inside a hole, like nothing gets better & you’re stuck feeling lonely. Be patient with yourself!! You have this sub. There are people who care about you. IT GETS BETTER. I promise.

I've quit before but I think 4 months was the longest before. I've never really dug in like this. I think I finally grew to hate the negatives more than the positives. It's an insanely deviant drug. What other drug makes you feel good about everything, even when you shouldn't feel good about it. I was living a life if mediocrity for 11 freaking years. I made myself do things to get ahead during that time, but virtually nothing was fun without it and I was so far from my real driven self for the entirety. In eleven months, I've done so much. From working out way more, to buying investment properties, to getting my daughter in sports, life is finally taking off again. Going thru PAWS, it felt like nothing would ever be good or normal again. Thinking of how to get where I'm at now seemed so daunting. Reading stories on here of people ahead of me and how it does absolutely get better is what helped me thru. It was so powerful to know that everyone feels helpless and questionable going thru that at first, but that it DOES get better if you just stay away from the THC. The hell of PAWS is a constant reminder of why I want nothing to do with it again. This drug causes far more damage than society wants to admit. I lost 11 years. Thank God I haven't lost more.

I had so many reasons to quit. Weed has dominated the whole of my adult life. It's held me back from achieving what I know I'm capable of. After thinking about quitting for many years, I finally did it. I've read so much about this subject, from people that have already quit. Every single person seems to say that quitting was the best thing they ever did. People talk about all the benefits of quitting. They say that their life is so much better now. People said it was literally like they'd been reborn and now have so much extra energy, motivation and how amazing life is now they're free of the green stuff.
I feel like I've managed pretty well. The withdrawals were not even as bad as I expected and amazingly, cravings haven't been too bad.
I put that down to the fact that I genuinely wanted to quit. After 26 years, I decided enough is enough. I was really looking forward to all the benefits that quitting would bring me.
For the first 2 or 3 weeks I felt amazing. So happy with myself that I'd finally done it.
But now, after day 35, the initial excitement that I've finally done it has worn off. 
And this is my problem: 
I don't seem to feel the benefits that I was expecting to.
To be honest, I don't feel all that different to the last 26 years, except for the fact that I'm not stoned.
I don't feel that I've got so much extra energy.
I don't feel as optimistic as I expected to. 
And I'm asking myself was this even worth it if I don't feel that different to how I used to.
I'm really struggling to find reasons to carry on with this.
By day 35, the THC should be pretty much out of my system.
So where are these amazing benefits I was expecting? 
Please help. I'm feeling pretty depressed right now. 
I'm hoping that someone who also smoked for many, many years and maybe is further down the road than day 35 can explain what's going on.
When should I start feeling amazing? When should I feel like I've been reborn?

Anyways, I decided that I'm firmly quitting THC. Ever since I smoked for the first time in high school with some upperclassmen and until now, where I'm on the cusp of graduating university, my THC habit has gone unchecked. I constantly tried to justify its usage, by saying that ""it's not like other drugs"" and ""it's not physically addictive, so what's the harm?"" This led to a downward spiral of consuming THC, to the point where I needed to toke daily. I painfully realized that my habit had led to me losing friends and making ones where the only commonality was that we smoked. Part of the reason my justifications were sound in my head was that my academic performance was going smoothly and I excelled in my studies (I hate tooting my own horn, but I also don't want to be too modest). I thought that, as long as I did well academically, this justified me smoking and getting high. I must have unconsciously focused my life on academics and THC, leaving little to no attention towards my social life. As an undergraduate living with my parents, the practice of constantly hiding my habit also led to me hiding most of my social relationships (since most of them consisted of fellow smokers). Now that I'm graduating soon and (hopefully) entering into graduate school, I decided to face my habit and acknowledge the reality of my situation. I'm now sick of hiding stuff and forgoing relationships. I hope to use this post as a sort of ""mark"" to quit, with the notion that whenever I feel the urge to pick up THC again, I would look at this post and solidify my resolve. It's currently Day 4 of me not having consumed THC and I hope to continue this trend. Thanks for reading.",10,0

540,2021-09-20 00:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/prnnh7/day_2/,Day 2,"I (21f) got hooked on weed at the beginning of covid to deal with my anxiety. I’ve got severe anxiety and depression and have been medicated for both since I was 16, but college exacerbated my anxiety and I used weed to cope. I’ve used almost daily for 1.5 years. Have been trying to stop for 6 months at least. Have been working with a therapist about it but still struggling. I quit for like a week last semester, then for 3 weeks two months ago after a bad breakup + suicide attempt. I started again after getting out of the hospital because I was so afraid of my anxiety. 

Weed doesn’t even make me feel better anymore. It doesn’t necessarily make me feel more calm, it doesn’t help prevent racing thoughts. I get high every night and then lay in bed watching tv or reading or scrolling through Reddit, which is exactly the same thing I do if I’m not high. So it’s not even like I’m doing anything special on it. It makes me lethargic the next morning. 

For me, I don’t experience withdrawal. The few times I’ve stopped weed, i didn’t even really miss it. But when I have access to weed, I feel compelled to do it because it’s been my coping mechanism for so long. How can I stop? Any tips for managing severe anxiety/panic disorder? It gets so bad, I have panic attacks getting out of bed each morning (IF I can get myself out of bed). 

I typically only use at night. Rarely during the day. I can also be super productive on weed. I actually love studying while high because weed relaxes me enough to focus, rather than freaking out and getting anxious about how much I have to do or failing. But I don’t wanna be psychologically dependent on anything. It’s also a wildly expensive habit. Please help.",1,1

This is honestly the longest stretch of sobriety I’ve had in thirty years, since I first had a puff. The last twenty or more I’ve been a daily wake and baker. 

I can’t say enough good things about getting off the weed. It’s done great things for my confidence, energy levels, anxiety reduction and generally has made me a better person to be around.

I used to fall asleep mid movie on the couch most nights, repeated myself often in conversations because I forgot I had already told that story (and it wasn’t that great the first time either!) and spent time hanging with people who didn’t give a flying fuck about me. 

It’s a great feeling to have some more control over my life, to be less impulsive and generally more able to resist making poor decisions due to apathy and taking the path of least resistance. I am more focused on things I really care about and am not wasting as much time as I used to.

I saved a tonne of money and had the guts to take on a different job that involves much  more personal interaction I couldn’t have handled when high. 

I now have a #lifegoals sneaker collection instead of a bong blocked up with 6 months worth of resin. It might have taken me til middle age to learn how to look after myself , but cutting the weed has been the best gift I’ve given myself and the best move I’ve made in a long time.

I have made strides and recently do keep quitting after the relapses where as before May the relapse would always last for months. I objectively have a good job, great partner, a cute dog, am comfortable with my appearance unlike when I was young, I live in the city I always wanted to when I was a kid in a nice place … I can think of things to be grateful for, I certainly wouldn’t be better off without any of those things but I really struggle with feeling positive emotions, like I think I’m grateful but dont feel it. Like my brain knows things are “good” but I don’t feel the positive feelings. I started therapy in May, am on medication for depression, (the second one I’ve tried, I feel fine on it, scared to switch because the first one was awful) I’ve gone through boughts of meditation but struggle with consistency, I have managed to keep up exercising multiple times a week. Nothing brings me joy. I could be forgetting in my slump, I’m sure there were fleeting moments of happiness, I have had the pink cloud effect of quitting the last two times I quit and what was on the other side caused me to relapse. I quit a couple days ago and know this is usually the worst part. Oddly I am normally much more anxious than I currently am while quitting.

I feel like a loser saying this but I go back to weed because it’s the only thing that makes me REALLY happy. I feel guilty saying this because it’s like a slap in the face to all the objective good things I have. My quits generally last about 2 weeks, in June I made it to a month before relapsing but I just feel stuck. I haven’t given myself the chance to really clear it from my system and heal but I also have the fear that quitting won’t actually help heal the depression either.

I started smoking weed at 18 and I'm 25 now, at first it was amazing, I loved the stoner lifestyle, even grew some. But after a while I felt more negatives coming from consuming than positives. I was becoming slower, unmotivated, uncreative, asocial...It affected my relationship with my now ex girlfriend of 7 years, and all I cared about was smoking. I have an underpaid job and I know I could do far better but I was just happy with smoking and not giving a fuck.  
My girlfriend quitting me and failing a job offer from a big company was the turning point for me.

This is my second try, I did a 3 months break before coming back to smoking during this summer, and I regret it deeply. Those 3 months sober were amazing, well not at start but after a while I regained motivation, creativity, a healthy sleep pattern, less anxiety and overall happiness and health improvement.   
Then I got invited to a party with old friends and I though I could smoke a bit with them, and got instantly hooked back. It was quick and even I don't understand why I did it that way. I got hangover and though I could buy just some so I dont feel like shit...when the bag was empty one week after I instinctively asked my dealer for more, got back exactly how I was before quitting. I let myself down and hated myself for this. Why come back if you were feeling this good without? Damn brain...   


Anyways, for this second time I erased all the contacts that could get me buds, blocked them on my phone and social medias. I've also ghosted some of those old friends, I feel bad about it but even if they aren't bad people they're deep in drugs, not only weed, and they are kind of pushy with that, they don't believe you can get addicted to weed (dont even believe they're addicted to anything but do stims every 3 days), tell me I'm just being a drama queen...  
I've also started to read more, sport routine, cooking more, medidation...but I'm still foggy and didnt manage to keep those as a routine.   
Some days I'm pumped up and do a lot of things, but other days, like today, I feel like shit, mostly because I feel ashamed at all the time I wasted, I just hope to get back to the state of mind I managed to get in my first try quitting.   
But even if I'm a bit depressed today, I will not go back to weed, I want to work on myself, grow mentally, just become a better version of myself.

 Last night my girlfriend of 1 year sat me down and explained to me that she hasn't been happy for some time, that I'm not the man I was when we started dating, and I couldn't say anything but agree because she was right. I was so emotional because how could I have not noticed? I was caught in this haze of repetitively going through the motions and I'd convinced myself it was living. I convinced myself that this was who I was. 

The last few months I genuinely thought my life was the best it could be, I was happy and relaxed and comfy. In reality, I had simply become complacent and lazy, I wasn't achieving anything, I wasn't driven. I was just happy with the status quo, and that's simply never been who I am. I have always had drive and ambition, I've always had big plans, been adventurous, and I miss that man.

I nearly lost the love of my life because I've essentially lost my life, lost my drive for really living. That ends today. Today I am stepping back into being an active participant of my life, stepping back into  living. It's going to be difficult, but boy am I ready.

But my use has been way way less for quite some time now, so I guess I gotta celebrate the victories.","I feel so helpless and beaten down by this sometimes. I’ve made amazing progress that I’m proud of and I’ve come really really far. But quitting literally hundreds of times over 3 years just takes a lot outta ya. Plus, and after quitting many times in the last few weeks and again the last 2 nights in a row, being here yet again is just like…demoralizing. It’s hard building all this resolve and determination to quit in the moment but immediately want it again and be sucked back in the next day. I recognize that that determination must continue on after the fact as well because at least for me, that desire for more and those cravings coming on are an inevitability, so I am only making it outta this by getting through them. 

Idk, I’ve had some good times but overall weed has just hurt me really really terribly, and I’ve known for so long now that I just truly want to quit for good. It’s been a journey getting this far and I’m so glad I did, but I still yearn to be free. So I guess it’s just kinda crushing that I’m not yet, ya know?  And so many people have had struggled with substance use for decades because. Well, that insidious desperate irrational need for more is just a hell of a bastard, and addiction is a serious disease. I fully believe weed is something that for anyone who can use it and not ever get addicted, never have to grapple with that darkness, it can be a positive thing. But for me, I know deeply, 
without a single doubt, that not having it in my life is the right and only choice.

I used to feel like the weight of all my “failures” was unbearable to face. But my friends and the experiences of other people really changed that and made the remaining weight a lot easier to bear. I also realized that all of that exists in the past; I don’t need to overcome an amalgamated creature of regret and past challenges, all I have to do is take on is what lies ahead, one day at a time. 

To wrap up this already long post, some of the absolute most helpful things for me have been love and support and understanding from close friends, professional counselling (which I’m lucky enough to be able to get for free right now), taking a lot of time to think about/process how I feel about using when I am high, and also why I use, why I wanna stop, stuff like that, and writing it down. Another thing was, and this is still a big WIP, is coming to terms with all of that shame that I felt & feel. And finally, sometimes it’s just been some raw willpower and a desire for my own happiness.

&#x200B;

anyway, circumstance is i'm now in a place where i would very much like to stop smoking again. main consumption is tobacco joints, which presents the double whammy issue of nicotine - most weed abstinence is currently balanced by a sharp increase in cigarette consumption. on previous quits, i have managed pretty well on stopping both of these compulsive behaviours overnight by ridding the place of any and all paraphenalia, usually taking the trash out to a public bin to avoid thinking 'well there was a cigs worth of tobacco in that pouch, i'll just have that one'.

&#x200B;

these switches usually come after a build up of personal care behaviours - eating well, exercising regularly, meditation, reducing caffeine (at least switching coffee to green tea), sleep hygiene, good hydration and all that jazz. i've been working on this over the last 2-3 weeks to get me set. 

&#x200B;

problem is - i've been at this point a couple of times over the last few months, but the presence of my partners smoking supplies erodes my already rubbish willpower. i know quitting is the best thing for me. i genuinely think that my partner is on the journey to sobriety as well but completely respect that he is not in a place to stop dead right now. he's amenable to restrictions (not skinning up in the house, smoking away from the house) but something in my head knows its here and won't currently override its default to the 'easy route'. neither of us are great with enforcing boundaries or restrictions on ourselves so there's progress, but its a bit slow, you know?

592,2021-09-18 21:56:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pqz452/a_tip_bilateral_stimulation/,A Tip: Bilateral Stimulation,"I'm a year and 2 weeks sober. I thought I'd share something that I've learned that's really helped me with sobriety. 

Addiction is all about control; you use weed (or other substances) to control your internal state, improve your mood, relax yourself, escape from painful experiences, etc. We seek out substances because they allow us to regulate our moods/emotions/experiences.

I've learned a technique called **bilateral stimulation,** and it's been really helpful when I'm craving and edging anywhere near relapsing**.** 

Essentially, the part of our brains that controls addiction is a very primordial, ancient part of our brain, which is why it so easily evades rational thought and choice and our best efforts. Addiction lives in the same part of the brain as fight or flight and hunger and a lot of very basic animal instincts. Our forebrain houses the parts that operate self-control, choice, rational thinking, etc. 

When you're craving, you need to snap your brain out of its ancient mode and get back to your regular, health-seeking self. 

Bilateral stimulation involves any sort of action or sensation that operates on either side of your body. Walking is a good example - it's why going for a walk literally calms your brain down and gets you thinking rationally. 

My version of bilateral stimulation is crossing my hands over my chest like a mummy, giving myself a hug. I close my eyes and breathe and imagine a moment of bliss and joy (summers on the lake with my family), and I tap each arm with the opposite hand. Right hand taps left arm/shoulder, left hand taps right arm/shoulder. 

Left, right, left, right, left, right, breath in, breath out, remember the sand between my toes. I am okay. It's okay. I've got this. Left, right, left, right, left, right, breath in, breath out. I am safe, I am fine, I am enough. Being alive is good. It doesn't need to be fixed or remedied or made more bearable or made more enjoyable. Left. Right. Left. Right.

Keep tapping it out until the need goes away.

However the Venn diagram of things I like to do and things people will pay me to do has no overlap. Part of what’s discouraging is that career wise, I’ve already “made it” so improving that situation is not a motivation for me to get straight.

Even with a great job, having to work for a living makes this incredibly difficult. I’m very impressed with anyone who can live a sober life while working a job they truly hate, because for me that would be impossible.

Backstory: 
Currently visiting my family out of state and decided it was time to quit pot cold turkey. I was smoking pretty much 24/7, especially for the last week before leaving as I wanted a proper sendoff to binge whatever I could. 🤣 Things I was smoking were mainly dabs, flower, and pens.  I also have depression/medicated for that currently but probably besides the point. 

How I’m feeling: 
Even around my family I’m still quite sad! I thought this would make me happy, but I suppose the withdrawals could be making me sad. I’ve gone through the heavy withdrawals before (night sweats, low energy, no appetite… the usual), but it’s hard to remember what the emotional side effects were. I’m wondering if this sadness I’ve been feeling is potentially related to the withdrawals? My life is good right now, but I’m just so sad ever since I got here.  Is this normal? Is there anyway to improve things? 

Anyways:
I appreciate any advice or words of encouragement you guys have!  Any and all is welcomed.",2,0

Finally got some rest this morning, and WAS feeling positive. 

Its nice wake up WITHOUT my heart pounding and feeling like the world is ending. 

This is my day off work, Theres lots to do - and being sober I can see the problems and  am actually WILLING to do something about it.  ( starting with small issues within immediate reach)

8 am: bad news came;  there’s something I have to take action on, it came as a surprise - but these things happen.  

A slight panic reaction was building in my mind.

830am :Something tragic , which i have no control over, happened far from me. 

Shock and grief ensues. 

I sat and thought.  

Being sober let me see clearly the two paths before me;

Sober:
Present, Engaged and positive. 

High:
Disassociated, disengaged, destructive. 

If i were still smoking I would have drowned my emotions so as to not feel whats happening. 

I stayed sober.  

I made the calls necessary to take action on the things i am responsible for. 

I also reached out to console the loss of, and celebrate the life of a wonderful human being.  

Her life was taken by a driver that was most likely under the influence of Alcohol. 


This is a big change.  A week ago, I would feel down and want to get high If didn’t say the right thing, or forget to do something small. 

Again, if i were getting HIGH i would be useless to everyone including myself. 

I’m not giving up my sobriety.  

I will not take that away from myself.

At the bottom I have included some quotes from other /r/leaves users who chimed in.

I smoked compulsively for about eight years, to the point that it had a negative effect on my life. I would even do it when I knew that I would regret it. I was addicted, and now I'm not.

Several  factors helped me escape the addiction. I became more concerned about  the unknown long-term physical and mental effects, instead of just  rationalizing it as ""just weed bro."" I also started weekly talk therapy  to deal with other issues, not my addiction directly. But therapy helped  me become more aware of my own patterns, and the various lies I would  tell myself.

Still, despite those  factors, I relapsed repeatedly. I don't mean the occasional slip-up, I  mean falling back into full-blown every-waking-hour THC consumption. The  one thing that finally allowed me to break free for good was a simple  realization: that weed doesn't do what I thought it does. **It doesn't expand my consciousness.**

The  thing that kept me coming back to weed was not the desire to chill out  and go to sleep, because weed never effected me that way. It was the  desire for a mild *psychedelic*  experience. I thought that weed made the colors brighter and music more  beautiful. I thought that it stimulated my creativity, and allowed me to  step outside myself and see reality more objectively. Because that's  what it used to feel like when I was a teenager. But now, I realize that  it actually does the opposite when you use it compulsively, excessively. I feel much more alive and awakened now that I'm sober.

Quotes from the previous thread:

>It definitely loses its magic. When I first started it was  like an event. I knew that music was going to sound awesome. Food was  going to be delicious. But then eventually I needed it just to be able to eat. /u/WholeHoliday8268

>I was constantly chasing that early high, and it ended up just numbing me into oblivion /u/AndreuxH

But I personally found that keeping track of how many days I’ve been clean was just my addicted brain’s way of setting a trap for itself. Secretly always looking forward for the next time we (my addicted brain and myself) could get high, and always making excuses. “If we can reach 10 days then clearly we don’t have a problem and we can reward ourselves” and sure enough 10 days would pass followed by a months long bender. “Ok, 10 days was too soon, but if we can do 100 days, then for sure you’d have proven we’re not addicted”… bender. 

I couldn’t escape that cycle, until one day, I said ‘f’it, I’m not going to count. I’m going to forget this day so that it has no power over me.’ 

I’ve been clean now for maybe 4 years (after 10 years of being perpetually high), but truth is, I don’t know for sure how long it’s been. And I like it that way.

So I've been 55 days weed free atm. I've been puffing the joints daily since 2013. I've tried to quit multiple times since 2017 but with no success. 

Lets go back where it all began, It was back in 2010, I was 23, me and my bff was smoking for the firsttime in august, stargazing and seeing all kinds of amazing stuff in the skies. I kept it a social rare threat for a few years until my girlfrield moved in with me, Its now 2013, I keep feeling needing ""me"" time and light up at the evening, usually alone. Fast forward 8 bloody years and it's may 2021.

I'm feeling numb, lazy, lethargic, useless, nervous, &  anxious as fuck. 

When it all began back in 2010 it took a puff to feel chilled for a good 4-6 hours, nowadays it last maybe 20 mins and then i crave more, and it's a vicious circle.

I decided in my head that this had to stop, I can't be a slave for a substance.

I was off work for summer holidays from 24th of july till 22nd or august

I kept myself smoke free, I had no urgers surprisingly, we went on a roadtrip around the counrty due to covid, i fell alseep everynight, no urges, didnt even thing about it. 

I'm now 2 months clean but i still feel just as anxious as when i was smoking, maybe worse to be honest, still lazy a couch potato due to feeling uneasy leaving the house. My ""alone"" time now is spending a few hours everynight on minecraft with friends to ""escape"". feel I'm in the same rut without the ""high"" of the thc.  

My workout schedule consist of biking to work everyday 15km 5 times a week, hiking in the mountains 5-10km 3-4 times a week. I eat mainly keto/carnivore but end up drinking beers, gin, vodka on the weekend due to hanging out with my ex-stoner / drinking friends. 

&#x200B;

I still feel the same brainfog as i did back in may, still feeling slow and ""weird"" is social setting like I've been the last 8 years just without the high ""threat"" in the evenings. 

&#x200B;

I hope it will get better, I dont really want to go and see a doctor and get pills etc, I just want to get more energeric, less anxious and a liftet mood. 

I have no urges to smoke again, but i just wonder if this could be caused my a lifestyle with friend / girlfriend that i dont genuinely  agree with. I perfer sober weekends either gaming in bad weather or go hiking and camping for the weekend, but guilt get to me.  They always question me like I'm in the wrong.

tonight he lashed out at me and said I've not done anything for him in regards to the kidney. this is the opposite of his character. previously he told me and our other close friend he didn't want us to talk to them because he couldn't stand the thought of having to tell her parents that we died or at least there would be a possibility. he's obviously scared and then really bad place and I'm hoping to talk to him when things are a bit different. 

the thing is this is really made me feel like I need to numb myself. I've had such a good time stopping weed, i've actually managed to minimise the side effects and see a lot of positive change in my life. but no worries at this is going to be the catalyst for me falling back into it. 

how the fuck do I stay strong right now.

Part of the how came from my many attempts to quit but for the most part I'm still surprised (and grateful) to be here.

That being said; my life today is SO much better than it was 60 days ago. For over 6 years I was living an isolated life without any concrete goals or plans for my future. I was putting a bandaid in the form of weed over all my problems and past traumas. I've done therapy and attempted work on myself but never made it to the point of fully removing that weed bandaid and facing everything head on.

Now that I have, I can't believe I waited so long. Granted, staying sober is no easy task and again I'm not entirely sure how I'm still doing it. I still have cravings but I also have a reason to keep going; and that reason is a better, healthier and happier future. 

Here's what I've accomplished in the past 2 months being 100% weed-free:

1. I quit my very toxic job and went back to school for a second degree in a career I love. I have a plan for my future and expect to have my master's in less than 4 years from now. 
2. I have healthy habits such as; having a very simple morning/night routine that includes making my bed, journaling, taking care of my body, getting enough sleep. I am also so much more organized than I ever was while smoking. 
3. I remember shit better. Shows, conversations, things I have to do, etc. 
4. My eating habits are not perfect but have gotten much better. I used to get take out every single day and now the majority of my meals are home cooked (to be fair, i love to cook) 
5. I am so much more present in my interactions with friends and family. My relationships with people in my life are improving. 
6. I just feel so much better. I feel alive, human, productive, and best of all; happy. 

What helped me?

\-The first month, I attended MA meetings on zoom 3-5x a week. This was vital for me personally. 

\-This subreddit and the support/wisdom it provides is incredible. Thank you all.

\-Feeling all the feelings rather than trying to ignore/suppress them.

\-When I get an urge, I remember how my life is changing for the better in both small ways and big and that smoking even once will put me back into my unhealthy habits and daily smoking. I know this because I've tried to quit for over 2 years and this is the first time it's actually sticking. Prior to this the longest I've gone is less than two weeks. 

\-Replacing smoking habits with non-smoking ones; IE- i used to love smoking on my balcony, now I drink my coffee on my balcony. 

Basically, if you really want to change your life for the better and feel sobriety is what it will take to get there; stick to it. Even if you relapse, stick to it. It's not easy and most are not successful on the first try but every single attempt is progress and a step closer to achieving sobriety/a better life. 

If I could do it you can too, trust me.  <3",13,0

I dunno. I am very firm with my no smoking/vaping/edibles etc (29 days coming from 10 years daily heavy use)...but sometimes these  thoughts  threaten my logic . Like i come to think ""why should i be so rigid and strict if i might want to do this?""

I answer myself that this could easily lead me to having no dreams (important part for my spiritual journey) and feeling like wanting more, so having attachment to this substance again and be influenced by it.
Also after 29 days i would not know how my body and mind might react to this.
Still, there is this thought: why wouldn't you smoke.from time to time?

I have been smoking weed regularly since I was 14, and became an avid smoker by 18. I smoked all day everyday through college and continued on until last year. I am 28 now. I moved to a new city last year and had no connect, I couldn’t find one either due to corona. The break was great, but I got little to no sleep. The only way I could sleep is through exercising for around 2-3 hours a day.  Which is very hard to do. Even then, I would be lucky to get around 5-6 hours of rest. This lasted for about 6 months until I found a connect again. When I did, I slept and slept and it felt amazing. I wouldn’t wish that type of insomnia on my worst enemy.

That being said, I hate that when I have weed, I only look forward to smoking. I don’t smoke anywhere near what I used to (went from waking and baking and nightly bong rips- to now just a few pipe hits before bed) and I’m proud of that, but there’s still many cons to what I do smoke. I’m of course foggy, it’s super hard to wake up (complete opposite problem), I get dark circles under my eyes, and of course it costs a lot.

I quit this week and it feels great…except I can’t sleep at all. Which feels awful. I try everything. Meditation, reading, exercise, calming apps. Everything. Nothing works.

I spent most of my childhood angry and alone, albeit very good at pretending I was a ""normal, intelligent prodigy"" whose goal was to graduate at the top of my class, become a surgeon, and never live in poverty ever again. Of course, adverse childhood events fuck with you in different ways, and mine decided to fuck me over in my last year of school and first year of University. 

Depression, anxiety, PTSD, realising there was a pretty major likelihood of being autistic, and being thrown into College at 16 with actively harmful ""support systems""  destroyed my sense of self and I lost my place in my med program. Two or so years later, I decided to try weed. At first, I hated it because of the assosciation with my parents, but then I realised it numbed the pain. It numbed anything and everything and for the first time in years, I could crack a smile. I was funny, I was energised, I was a social butterfly. Not long after, I had a full time job and the occasional puff at parties escalalated to smoking non stop from 2017 to the beginning of 2021. At the beginning of the year, I moved house, leaving the habit behind and lasted from March to June (!!!!). But of course, CPTSD  doesn't just go away, and I fell back into the habit after I had to stop taking pain medication due to gastrointestinal intolerance. Gotta fight endometriosis somehow!

I do not want to smoke again. I do not want to end up like my parents. But I'm realising I'm still so entangled with my CPTSD, and my desire to quit years ago was put on hold because I didn't know how to cope without being high. Unfortunately, you can't just numb yourself and ruminate alone for 4 years (don't worry, I also had psychologist who just....wasn't helpful). Introspection comes at a cost, and that cost was friends, failing out of two other degrees, being pretty shitty at my job and losing any and all drive to dig myself out of my predicament. All that remains are the memories, and the choice: to be a passive or active participant in the washing machine of drug addiction. But what even was my ""why""? Why did it matter if everything I had set up for myself had been destroyed?

If you're here, you've probably asked yourself ""why"" a few times in the past. Struggling with any form of mental illness is tough, but when the self help turns to self sabotage, the only person that can hold you accountable is yourself. I'm struggling. A lot. Quitting for the second time this year, currently on day 4 withdrawing hard, living by myself and unemployed. My  I guess we'll see where this attempt takes me. I don't have many people left in my life, let alone people who have struggled with addiction. If anyone else has struggled with CPTSD and smoking, I'd love to hear your thoughts or any advice on healthy introspection. Thanks for reading pals xx",42,0

I tried quitting more times than I can count. 5 months ago I started getting physically active, eating healthy(lost 20kg) and got a consistent sleep schedule of 8 hours every day. I quit weed 4 days ago and It feels much easier this time around. I know I may not seem like a lot but I’m certain I’ll not start using again. I found out what amazing results consistent work give. I feel like there’s this snowball effect in me right now that just keeps rolling. The only symptoms of withdrawal I’m experiencing this time around, is night sweats which to be fair are pretty bad but definitely manageable I just sleep on a towel. So what I would advise you to do is start working on yourself. As I did my thoughts started changing. I used to be stuck in my head and generally mean to myself. I told myself that I couldn’t quit weed and that I was fat and ugly I just accepted it. I’m here to tell you that all of us are able to make this transformation and that it is worth it. Though you’re not gonna get there being mean to yourself. You can be your own best friend or your worst enemy. One last tip would be to quit for yourself and not because someone wants you to.

I recognized I used too much every day and I was depressed. Marijuana was masking many other issues and it made me complacent. I lost interest in many of my hobbies and was always lethargic. I do not miss that person and I never want to be in that position again. But I also recognize the joy I had initially, when using in small doses very rarely with friends. 

And while I’ve been sober from marijuana much of the last year, I’ve still had the occasional beer. I’ve even done other drugs during this time. So the goal was never exactly “stay sober forever,” just, “eliminate the dependency on marijuana.” Which I’ve most certainly done.

I bring all of this up because I’ve been given the opportunity to smoke again tomorrow evening, a friend has offered to treat me. And I actually am considering it. I want to. But I also really don’t. I’m conflicted. I would like to because I miss the feeling. But I also recognize the likelihood I won’t enjoy it in the moment. And I would like to avoid it because seeing the days I’ve been sober and all the money I’ve saved on my Grounded app, is extremely rewarding. But I also recognize my goal was never to reach a certain goal based on time, just to separate myself. And I’ve done that. 

I’m thinking that if I setup parameters I will be fine. I cannot easily access it after this one smoke, and I think it would be encouraging to (hopefully) realize I can smoke just once and move on.

4+ Year smoker 
Started on distallate cartridges (Age 13)
Daily, Chronic user


Where do I start. I remember first dissociating after smoking the craziest looking weed I’ve ever seen, I noticed I was viewing my life and thoughts and actions instead of influencing them. I thought this is sick it feels like I’m in a movie! It was fun, I thought I was just super high. That’s happened a few more times throughout the years never thought much of it, that was until a year ago. I went on a vacation to a illegal state and brought 300mg edibles, ate 1-2 a day (300-600 lab tested edibles, I wasn’t eating some Stoney patch these were dispensary) for 6 days. On the last day the bars barely even hit. I decided on the 7th day I’d like to not be super high and skipped breakfast (300mg). What came after that was the scariest panick attack/dissociative experience I’ve ever had. I felt so fake and out of this world, it’s unexplainable. I calmed down after many hours and it didn’t really happen again. Over these last few months I’ve been noticing myself very very out of touch with reality, forgetting who I am, my moral code, what my goals are, what’s real and what’s not. I don’t know the goal of this story I just wanna hear I’m not alone and the lack of memories and sever dissociation I’m feeling is not one of a kind.",7,0

It started with weekends only, as I was in high school and it was still illegal, I couldn’t really smoke more than that. 

Later on, I started smoking more and more often until it became an everyday habit for me. I was a daily smoker for most of my adult life (I’m 26 now), with periodic breaks of a few months each in between. 

This January, I decided enough was enough. I entered a new relationship with a lovely girl, and I was sick of the guilt I’d feel by hiding my usage from her. I was not reaching the goals I wanted to in life, and I ping ponged between being blissfully unaware while high to being ashamed and depressed while sober. 

To this day, I’ve only smoked 3 times since January. For me, that’s a big win. Listen, quitting doesn’t have to be all or nothing. I can confidently say that this year is the year I’ve smoked the least since starting this awful habit. 

Now, for some benefits;

1. Much less irritable

When I was smoking, the smallest things would cause me to get irritated and blow up. I’ve noticed this year that I’m much less agitated in my day to day life. Zen.

2. Clearer thinking

I work as a copywriter. Before, it would take me a bit to find the words I wanted to say. Now, I’m dialled in and I can write much more efficiently.

3. Less anxiety 

I used to feel somewhat anxious in some social situations. Now, I have my old confidence back and I can speak to pretty much anyone, anytime. 

4. More motivation 

This is a big one. I’ve never been more motivated to change my lifestyle as I am now. These days I go to the gym, eat healthy(ish), and work harder to further my career! 

I just wanted to say my story for anyone considering or struggling to quit.

I've smoked since I was 17 ( 21 now)  years old. About 3 times a week. Since 2020, and all the shit going on I got into a deep depression which entailed smoking 8+ bowls a day. It got unhealthy super quickly. What was once a social habit with my buddies to enjoy some Kid Cudi turned into a dependent relationship.

So I decided to quit immediately. And I did.

Since then, I sleep like a baby, often dreaming about crazy scenarios, and being able to remember them. Furthermore, I began spending the time I used to smoke on better hobbies like reading and exercising. My short-term memory is actually functional as well which feels empowering. I would once forget a simple thought like ""cut your nails"", walk up the stairs and completely gap out.

And Ide pick my brain and try to find something more, but it seemed like it didn’t exist. Now I can have a somewhat proper conversation and I don’t struggle with eye contact AS much.

I thought I had finally made it over the hill.

Cut to about 9 weeks later, I had been doing great! I needed a reward. I stopped at the head shop near where I work, saw a bong was 50% off! What a deal! I couldn’t pass it up; I had overcome my issues I told myself, I’ll only reward myself on weekends. I ignored the addiction I had admitted to myself that I had, and sure enough, I was back to everyday use. I started making poor decisions, I was isolating myself from the many new great friends I had made in the beginning of the summer, my work suffered, my mental health suffered. For the past few weeks I knew I needed to quit but couldn’t muster the strength. Until 3 days ago, I was in my new place eating McDonald’s for the 15th day in a row because I was too lazy to cook (and I’m a damn solid cook might I add). And I just had a mental breakdown and started sobbing for no reason. In that moment I had the strength to flush my weed again, I knew it had to be then or I’d be like this for weeks to come. The relief I felt was tremendous. I still have my bong, but I’m planning on going out with my friend whose a legal gun holder (need permits in my country that are too annoying to get) and taking it out onto his big farm and blasting it away. Partly because guns are fun to shoot, but it’s also a good metaphor. I’m on day 3 now, still not fully out of the haze but feeling much more positive toward life and my ambitions, and having INSANE dreams. 

I hope that one day I can muster up the ability to start some form of non profit, I’d like to make one about the hidden dangerous of cannabis addiction and provide resources for quitting. I’m not sure if such a thing exists or is feasible, but I like to dream. Until then I’m going to be coming here regularly to stay on top of things.",3,0

I'd really just like some reassurance that regardless how deep I let myself fall into this pit, I'll be able to get out eventually. I need to find a partner and at least start excelling in life, and weed has completely analed my ability to do so.

I had issues with girls. I had social skills issues. I had just 2 ""friends"" who were in reality just smoke buddies. Even though we knew each other for majority of our lives, our relationship was pretty shallow and I never felt comfortable in being vulnerable with them and trusting them 100%. 

And guess what.... I still have all those issues, nothing changed. Still, at almost 26yo with no relationship experience. It is really pathetic tbh. I think I haven't seen much people here struggling as much as I do. 

Just one thing changed. At first, I was so depressed that I was crying about it every day. But as time went by, instead of facing those issues, I did what I knew how to do best. I just smoked through them. I somehow accepted it that I will be like this for the rest of my life and weed made it easy for me to ignore it. 

Now, I have no more weed to help me ignore it. And I still don't have motivation to do anything about it. Even though I know that all I have to do is take action and build some momentum. Which would be impossible while smoking weed. 

I still have all those habits of time wasting activities, it is really hard to force myself finally live a life after all those years of hiding in a shed. 

But I realise all of this. What I have to do now is exactly what I had to do 5 years ago.

But man, this time it is different. Every other day I have a dream where I am smoking weed.

Funny thing is, that even in those dreams, I know that I quit weed and I never understand how the hell can I be toking? I threw out all my paraphernalia and it has been long time since I saw my smoke buddy who was getting weed for us. So I guess I just bought it again?! Haha. 

I think I am close to getting Lucid Dream. Last time I quit, I was in a dream where we were living with my family in completely different house than we actually do live. And I told my father ""Do you know we are in a dream, right? We live in different place in real life""  He looked at me in way that he thought I must be crazy, haha 😄 

When I wake up, I am always glad that I actually didn't smoke. But those dreams after quitting are usually pretty violent. Since I quit 11 days ago, I don't remember a dream where I wouldn't be killed or beaten by someone, or somehow ridiculed or didn't end up in a prison or some shit. 

For example, few days ago, I had a dream where I was invited to house of my elementary school classmate. She was rude to me so I got angry and asked here infront of everyone why does she do it? 
She told (while everyone was watching and listening) that she hacked my phone and she sees me everytime through camera how I am masturbating and it is disgusting 😅😅 I was completely done at that point.

Had the hardest time falling asleep even-though i had physically tired myself out. 

Kept going from cold to hot and sweating profusely.  Everything felt uncomfortable. 

I was thinking this was going to be pain free.    Guess it might take a bit for my thoughts to level out.

I hope you all are well and staying tough on the healthy high(sober)road. 

All the best.

I started smoking weed when I was just 13 and have been smoking every day (with the exception of some international travel) since then. I would smoke the minute I finished work, all weekend, and wouldn't stop until late Sunday night. I'd smoke with friends, while playing video games, while watching YouTube, just about every moment I could. 

A few years ago I started to see that my depression was a real thing and that smoking weed was only hurting me, but still I continued. I'd smoke and feel high and carefree for the first 30 minutes, then start to feel guilty and hate myself for perpetuating the cycle. 

Over the Christmas break, I confided to my girlfriend exactly that and we began talking about what it would take for me to quit. Starting in January I quit cold turkey. Over the next few months I was on and off again. Typically staying sober while staying with her, then quickly returning to my apartment to bury my head in weed. As you can imagine, this caused a lot of problems in my relationship with her, but also with other friends and opportunities I'd turn down just to be high. I would quickly turn down events or get togethers just to stay home and get high. 

I'd also let fights between us escalate so I could run away and get high. This went on for months, a sick cycle that benefited no one but my dealer. 

Then, about a month ago, she introduced me to r/leaves. At first I thought it was lame and wouldn't offer me anything, but then, day by day I'd read more and more posts and find parallels with my own experience. I fed off the positivity that there were other people just like me, struggling to quit and move past their addiction. 

I joined a gym for daily exercise, started therapy, and quit in earnest 28 days ago. I recognize that it's more than just r/leaves that gave the will to quit, but I'd be an idiot to dismiss this community outright. 

After 28 days and weeks of lurking in this subreddit, I thought I'd share my story with the rest of you. You're not alone and together we can all become (or return) to the bright, energetic and confident selves we so desperately want to be. Don't give up, take it day by day, and remember that you're not the first to quit. We all stand on the shoulders of those that came before us.",276,0

I’m not even sure if I enjoy being high, but I couldn’t imagine spending a day sober since and am still trying to reconcile that that is a normal, healthy way to live. Usually, I replace weed with other drugs when I don’t have it. 

Over the last two years I have become increasingly unmotivated and isolated. I still don’t love getting high with other people — I feel like I’m fighting through it to have a “normal” conversation most of the time. 

I’ve tried taking a few t breaks but nothing longer than a day has been successful.

I was asleep in my bed in a share house I was living in and woke up to a naked girl I didn't know on top of me trying to pull my pants down. I was a virgin and 21 years old. my ""friends"" were constantly harassing me and I guess in my half asleep daze, this seemed like an out.

Unbeknown to me, the drunk girl on top of me did not like me and did not want to sleep with me but had been pressured to do it by my ""friends"" which they afterwards would tease me about so nothing even changed. although I developed a deep shame about the situation i never realised that I was assaulted until a year ago while telling my new friend the story i said ""can you imagine if i was a girl and she was a boy?"" and at that moment I realised it didn't matte what my sex was. it also didn't matter that I went along with it after I woke up. I broke down and cried for a long time. I was assaulted and my sexuality was broken.

I have never had a relationship and my self worth is rock bottom. I know it's silly but the part that hurts the most is that she didn't like me. in fact was repulsed by me the next day when she was sober.

needles to say i have smoked a lot of weed in those nine years. sure it has hidden my feelings but they have not gone away. in fact they have festered and grown into an ugly beasts.

I'm done hiding, I want to confront my demon and I want to stop hating myself.

but its so hard and I need help...

Don't know if it was mindset or result of repetitive trauma as a youth. 

I remember clearly thinking “ fine.. fuck the world...imma smoke  and fuck what you think”.   Abandonment issues, forgotten child syndrome turned into self pity and self harm.

I had an ankle sprain so i was on bed rest, all i did during that time was smoke up and then smoke cigarettes and eat junk. Ankle got a bit better and i was able to walk when panic attack happened. 

It was 5 AM. i just finished smoking up a joint and all of a sudden I can’t breathe, visible confusion, i tried taking depth breaths but couldn’t shake the feeling off, drank some water with lemon juice and after I finished drinking i saw my hand shaking and trembling, lemon juice made me feel a bit better and after a while i came back inside. When it first stuck, the only thing in the back of my head was that i don’t want my family to find any stash so i went back in my apartment and hid it somewhere where it won’t be found incase i die today. 


Fast forward a couple of weeks, I smoke another joint and there it hits me again, panic attack, this time it was so bad i had to call my brother to pick me up to take me to hospital. I even called my dad I don’t usually call him in times of distress as I don’t want him to suffer either. Doctors did blood tests and everything came out good, massive relief. That night i decided i won’t smoke no more, i quit right there and then. I haven’t smoked a cigarette or a joint in over 48 hours. Had another panic attack today but it didn’t last that long. I don’t ever want to have a panic attack ever again but i believe as THC combined with nicotine will leave my body i will probably experience more but I don’t ever want to go back to this devil’s lettuce. 


Thank you for reading and drop an encouraging comment that i will keep reading during this tough time. I believe in my heart i can get rid of these toxic habits forever.


Edit: today marks 21 days without any sort of THC entered my body, I am extremely grateful for this community that pushed me to pull the plug.",7,0

Week 1-4 (physical symptoms) : bone aches, terrible night sweats, insomnia, sweaty palms, fatigue, nausea.

Week 1-4 (mental symptoms): depression, anxiety (meaning i was not only anxious but there weirdest things made me anxious such as being social, random thoughts etc.) super self conscious and overly aggressive.

The days following the the first month i came to realize all of the physical symptoms have disappeared. Sadly the mental symptoms are still here. The good news i can start to feel the difference in regards to my brain rebooting because on day 35-37 i had no more withdrawal symptoms (crazy right!) Sadly they came back today on day 38:/ but this means that things are starting to go back to normal and in the right direction. TIME HEALS ALL. Don’t give up and try to make it to day 90.

But now i know that what i was chasing with smoking 10 joints per day was not achieveable.

So i thought - what if i die because of this, or what if i create (smoking tobacco as well in joints) the perfect setting for a cancer or some lung desease?

At the end, also people who never smoke can get lung cancer, but i would blame myself a lot for have built a bad future for me just because I WAS A SLAVE OF CULTURAL PRACTICE AND ADDICTED TO HIGH SENSATION.

28 days ago i decided to stop this.
I am afraid to try to smoke a single joint now about relapse, and i think i am not gonna do this for a long long time.
Maybe in some time i might try tonprove myself i no longer feel attachment. But there would be no real.sense into this probably. I do not have to prove anything besides i can be happy without joints.

Beside this, i am chasing another thing, my spiritual practice, my path on buddhism, and i feel defenitely proud of myself for have broken down the chain of dependency.

I no longer feel withdrawals, expect of a little insomnia and during afternoon some lack of energy. But all very adaptable.

And more, i have my dreams back,i already had a lucid dreams in these 28 days (didn't have one in years maybe) and this is getting all about buddhism.

I think i might only have transported my dependency from joints to spiritual practice and lucid dreaming. But hey, even if it's like that, i am doing very good about this, also because i will eventually develop total non attachment, an impossible thing for my ""stoned"" self.

Just wanted to share this.

I’m more engulfed in things than I used to be, whether that be gaming, playing sports, playing music, etc. I don’t feel as apathetic towards stuff anymore. Basically, things are getting so much better. 

It’s important to remember though that quitting isn’t a fix all solution to our problems. That money you spent on weed will get spent on other dumb shit, but at least it’s not weed. I spend a lot more money on going out to eat, as well as golf equipment, but hey that’s better than weed, right? My diet fluctuates between great and terrible. I’m still completely in love with sugar. I still struggle with self compassion but it’s not as bad as before. I still don’t feel like I’ve made much progress with getting in better shape. I still let my house turn into a complete mess every now and then.

Basically, not everything has sorted itself out, but I’m finding it easier to work on those sorts of things. I’ve been getting cravings every now and then but I don’t give into them.

Then my train was late and I had so much stress at work (my job is system admin).

I struggled so hard to not smoke a cigarette at work, but I stayed strong. When I was done with working the cravings for both, cigs and pot, intensified. I almost called a friend to ask him if we can smoke a joint.

I managed to stay sober from both, but holy shit. The intensity of my cravings was insane. I'm still experiencing inner unrest. I ate a bar of chocolate, and bought another one. Sugar helps me to calm down.

Any suggestions to handle these cravings?

The doctors consider my case aggressive, and I definitely feel like shit a lot of the time. I'm in treatment, and I take 2 intense drugs per week that do not allow me to take any OTC pain relievers, because it interacts very strongly with the meds and would make me even sicker. I refuse to take narcotics. 

I'm also a daily pot smoker, and have been (on and off) for 15 years. Before the disease onset about 2 years ago, I had actually quit smoking and was pot-free for over a year and a half, one of my longest stretches. But the disease made me miserable, and then the medicine made me so nauseous that I ended up having to smoke again to be able to eat and function. (No anti-nausea meds for me either, they fuck with my mental illness for whatever reason.)

It started innocently. I actually had control and only smoked when I really needed it. My rule was smoking was to make me functional. I would smoke, the pain or nausea would decrease, then I would force myself to do something with the time I gave myself relief through pot.

Unfortunately, I have an addictive personality and it went from smoke when I'm at my worst, to smoking all throughout the day. It's been 2 years straight of it, and my wakeup call was last week. I had to get my 3rd Covid shot (immunosuppressed people are getting much lower vaccine protection due to the drugs and illnesses we have), and every time I have the shot, I have to completely go off my meds for a few weeks to ensure my body gets the best chance at developing antibodies.

It's fucking brutal. It puts me on my ass every time, causing a severe disease flare, on top of giving me hellish cluster headaches that are like being stabbed, which become so numerous and so intense that at peak, I just have to sit in a chair and look straight forward all day. No turning my head, no looking down at my phone. Nothing. My eyes hurt too much to even watch TV. I'm only just now coming out of it, and I took my shot 2 weeks ago today. (*Please* don't let me discourage you from the vaccine, I am not a normal case! Most people do not react like this.)

A few days into the sickness I ran out of indica. I had sativa, but no way was I going to smoke that when all I could do was stare at a wall. I couldn't drive myself to the dispensary, so I spent a week without smoking. I went through this hellscape of sickness with no pain support from pot, and although it sucked, it really put into perspective how much I am capable of suffering when I don't have the option of smoking. I realized, if I can make it through this, I can make it through my flares and pains day to day without pot. (The nausea is now pretty mild after my body got used to the meds.)

On top of that, my disease makes me at higher risk of lung disease, *and* it would probably be helpful to get a sober take on how sick I feel so we have a better idea on whether we should change my meds.

I say all that to say this. Pot may be helpful for a lot of sick people that struggle to function in life with their illness, but it just doesn't work for me. What's the point in feeling a tiny bit better if I'm just going to vegetate anyway? As far as I know there are no studies that conclude with enough evidence that pot works as an anti-inflammatory, so whatever I'm getting out of it is purely mental, at the cost of fucking up yet another part of my body, and dulling my brain to uselessness.

Since quitting a week ago I cannot believe how much time is actually in a day. The days feel twice as long. I can't believe how much extra air I get to breathe, and that I don't have to hack up a ton of phlegm every day, all day. I forgot how much smarter I am without pot, and that I can still enjoy things without having to be high. I forgot how much more responsible I am when I can't hide my problems by just getting high. I forget all these things when I smoke because the pot just convinces me that it's better than any sober outcome. It's a lie, and all of us here know it.

I don't really know what the point of this long ass post is. I guess to make me feel better about quitting even though it helps me cope with chronic illness? I dunno. All I know is that I can't let this continue. It hurts more than it helps now, and that's when you know you have to change.",8,5
759,2021-09-15 14:26:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/povwcy/ramping_up_to_quitting_again/,Ramping up to quitting again,"Hi all. I'm here for some advice, or just for someone to listen.

I am a daily/heavy weed smoker, have been since I was 18, and I'm 25 now. 

I've taken short breaks here and there, but for the most part I have been smoking daily this whole time. In 2019 I took my first major break. For about 2 months I was clean, which was completely new to me. Then I started smoking again. In the pandemic I smoked HEAVY. In the summer of 2020, I took a three month break, which is my current record. In the fall of 2020 I started smoking again, with varying levels of intensity until right now.

I know that I definitely want to be able to take a break without having it be such a big \*thing\* for me. That alone indicates that I need to reevaluate my relationship with weed, or cut it out entirely.

I've been working my way up to quitting again. For a couple of weeks now I've been trying to amp myself up. I've already started cutting down my intake, number of sesh's, etc. 

But I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety and resistance to actually taking the plunge, to a level that I did not face the previous two times I quit. In addition, I have A LOT of stuff on my plate that's entirely non-weed related. And I am looking for some outside perspective on how I should approach all of these things in relation to weed:  


* I'm currently trying to lose weight, so I'm trying to eat better and start a new gym habit. I've been able to successfully hit the gym before for a couple of weeks, but I haven't been able to build it into a long-term habit. Cooking is entirely new to me, so that's going to be a bit of a struggle until I learn the basics (like I did with the gym).
* I just started a new full-time WFH job last week so I'm creating/adjusting to a new routine (was unemployed for about 4 months before this)
* I recently have started seeing a neurologist that I really like for ADHD (who's aware of my smoking habits) and began treatment, which has been a positive change, but completely new to me as I just started a month ago. I think it's possible that the medicine I'm taking may be increasing my anxiety, and I've discussed this with my neuro, which we are currently monitoring. I'm very confident that the nature of my ADHD is not related to my weed usage (in terms of causation), because I exhibited multiple criteria throughout my childhood before I ever smoked a J
* I live at home with my family, and in the past 4 months, we went through a period of very high emotional turmoil and stress because of a fiasco where we were going to sell our house, move, and then at the very last minute had to cancel everything due to financial/employment issues. We are just now exiting this and re-entering a period of stability, but this whole period was very tough/stressful and I can feel that we all need to recover individually and collectively

So what is the point of listing all of this out? Because it *is* a lot, and each one of these things is difficult for me, and part of me wants me to wait until some of these things are more solidified or stabilized before I go into a withdrawal period, which will make everything suck even more (for a while). 

At the same time, part of me understands that my brain is trying to rationalize avoiding a difficult change. And part of me knows that quitting weed will help further all the goals I mentioned earlier. But I also am not confident that I have the mental space and energy right now to go cold turkey without throwing a giant wrench in my current momentum.

And to be honest, it's more important for me at this moment to make sure I hit the gym and start eating well and create a good routine and work on my ADHD treatment, than it is that I stop smoking weed. Like if I had to rank them in order of priorities, quitting weed would definitely be at the bottom. It's still extremely important, but I feel it's more important and doable for me right now to go to the gym 3-6x a week than it is to quit weed cold turkey.

And I know that the narrative here tends to solely blame weed as the source of problems, but I *have* been making positive progress in these areas, without significantly altering my weed intake. I think I can make even more progress if I take an extended break from weed or quit entirely, but I just don't think I'm there yet. But I'm stressing myself out a lot by thinking about this issue almost every day going back and forth in circles, and then also judging myself really harshly each time. It's putting me in a weird mental space. 

I feel like I'm punishing myself even though from an outside perspective I would be able to see that I am improving in certain aspects. Even though I *have* noticed that my intake has reduced and I am making positive progress and creating new habits that I wouldn't have in the past. I feel like I can't give myself permission to keep reducing my intake while focusing more on my other new habits (like gym/cooking/sleeping right) and come back to quitting weed a couple of weeks later once more things are solidified. 

It's like I want myself to do something that I feel might not be a good idea or even possible right now, and then I get mad at myself for not doing it, which makes me feel bad for no reason at all. And I am aware of that but it doesn't stop the constant mental cycle. And no matter which decision I may be leaning towards, I feel that it is not right. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts, observations, opinions, stories etc. I'm not advocating for weed usage in any sort here, just trying to better understand myself and what might work for me personally as I go about this process of general life re-structuring.",2,1

Daily smoker 1 - 2 grams a day for 12 years (only ever managing to quit for a month or so max), age 30 now. 

Everytime I go cold turkey I get PAWS, and each time its worse.

Timeline - First week not too bad, following weeks insomnia, mood swings, random outbursts of crying then stopping back to emotionless. Bouts of anger triggered by trivial things.. (I was looking forward to a Tesco extra special chicken kiev and found it was fancy and on the bone, I was so pissed off I punched the cupboard and messed up my knuckle, thats the extent 😂, not funny at the time but these are how wild your emotions can swing).

Most of the above subsided after about 1 month. From then onwards the real challenge began which was such bad brain fog daily, unable to concentrate or even motivate myself to do mundain tasks like clean up etc. Alongside this I was pretty depressed (months 1 - 3). 

Now I know this is all brain chemistry rebalancing and promised myself it will get better you know it will. I would have a day of respite here and there where I would feel happier, it comes in waves but they get further apart as the time goes by untill balanced. 

I am here today as the past 3 days I have felt a real shift. My mood is great, I feel optimistic, motivated, but most importantly able to think more clearly and remember things on the spot!! It’s not to say the waves wont come and go I’m sure they will return throughout the next few months, but having days like this really gives me hope and re-enforces how life can be. If you’re struggling trust that your happy days are coming, garunteed. Just stay strong, dont beat yourself up too much and visualise it happening, because it will.

Though.. when I returned home, the thoughts and cravings began to resurface but I was strict on myself to not give in. Until I found delta-8. I thought this stuff was great because it didn't get me super high like regular weed and still gave me the satisfaction I used to get from smoking. 

So I started doing this only on the weekends, and then ONLY at night, and then just one hit in the morning.. until suddenly I looked around and realized I was addicted to smoking again just like before. 

I was so dissapointed in myself. I felt like all that progress I made before was gone.. but I thought about it and realized that's not the case. If I did it once for that long, I can do it again. I know why I want to quit, I know the benefits of quitting.. so today is Day 0 all over again.

The urge to quit has been with me for at least 5 years now but I keep finding excuses to perpetuate the habit. I've watched as my friends and peers went to college and moved up in job positions while I stayed mostly stagnant and worked tier 1 tech job after tier 1 tech job, finding joy in music guitar and video games. I'm found a great woman a few years ago and have her and her son living with me now. Things haven't always been easy but they haven't always been hard either. I have always been high though...

Today is a big day. I've got a second interview scheduled for a tier 2 tech role with a new company that would provide a huge salary increase for  me. I want this job and I want to be able to handle it as best I can. My family deserves this. They deserve to see me with clear eyes and clear thoughts. My dog deserves enough energy from me to stay happy and engaged.

Right now is the easy part - I've thrown out all my paraphernalia and am excited for change. I know that the challenge, the struggle, the real effort will come late tonight when the house has settled and the cravings start to arise. I'm writing this to look back on then to help keep strong and stay the course. 

There is a better possible future ahead - even if the interview is a flop. I want to be present and ready for it.",12,0

Hey good people. Im a 19M, I decided to quit Weed 15 days ago. I smoked spliffs everyday multiple times a day since i were 14. Weed never affected me that much mentally. I do have lots of friends (who smoke, but also friends who don’t), i always went to the gym and i still got high grades in school. I’m in my first year of Uni right now. 

My problem always was that I’ve always had trouble with infections. I always got heavy throat infections, like 6 a year at least, bronchitis etc. I always smoked joints with tobacco, because the weed here is just to strong to smoke purely, so i also quitted tobacco 15 days ago. 3 days in i got a horrible throat infection in combination with a crazy bronchitis. I just cough my lungs out and I almost can’t sleep because of it. I can’t eat well because of the throat infection. I sometimes feel like dying. I’m scared that my body is so used to smoking it everyday day that i can’t live without, because I literally smoked all the time during my puberty. I can’t sleep more that like 3 hours a night right now, but i want to stay strong.

Any tips & help/motivation are welcome! Thank you very much. We’re all in this together",8,4

As a result, I've lost a tremendous amount of weight and I'm actually decently attractive. Weed has also dulled me socially. I feel less motivated to engage in convo's/ more withdrawn.

I won't smoke today. I'll try to concentrate on studying for the exams I have next month (probably wont be able to concentrate at all), but even if i don't do anything today, i will make sure I won´t smoke.

The hard part for me is that weed makes me still functional and helps me focus sometimes. So right now i'm not the most productive person I could be.

My reasons are:

* I want to finish my exams and become the best doctor I can. Pretty sure the top doctors aren't smoking weed daily.
* I want to have less social anxiety
* I want to get more serious with my gym workouts.
* I want to stop depending on a substance to be happy.

1. Weed helped me sleep. For this benefit I’ve been trying to do active shit everyday. I do two hard workouts every week, and then the other nights lighter stuff like frisbee golf, or walking downtown, or skateboarding. Just anything to tire my body out so I want to sleep. 

2. Euphoria - this is a harder one to find, but I’ve been doing these weekly midnight bike rides in the city with a few hundred cyclists. A lot of people are smoking weed and drinking, but for me it’s kind of nice to still be in the world without partaking. We listen to loud music and ride and laugh, and at the end of it, I’m tired so I can sleep. 

3. Creative thinking. This is what I miss the most. I used to have wildly creative ideas that actually turned into realities in my life. I’m not sure how to recreate this yet.

Finally, I remember the bad parts and use those to coach myself into sticking with it. 

1. Huge scary waves of anxiety. 
2. Thoughts of hurting myself or others.
3. General exhaustion. 
4. Fear of long term damage to my health. 

These are the things that made me want to quit, and I’m not getting any younger so they are why I am sticking to it. Anyways, I hope this can be of some help. We all have different ways of getting through this.",49,0

I take a T break by only smoking tiny amounts instead of fully stopping, and then the second I get more I go back to smoking constantly all day long. If I try moderation it works for a day or two and then I'm back to smoking all day long. This has been going on for the better part of a decade now and I always found a way to rationalize how much I used. I legitimate have some chronic pain issues, and some mental health issues, so I used those as my justification despite the fact that cannabis makes me anxious and while it takes the edge off it doesn't make the pain stop.

The worst part for me is that I've slowly watched myself lose interest in most of my hobbies, and my circle of friends has been reduced to mostly just me. I told myself cannabis was helping me live my life, and I believe that was true for a small period of time. But now all I ever want to do is get high and do nothing or scroll social media. I feel like I can't do anything without needing to smoke first because I've convinced myself I need to or I won't have fun, or the food won't be good, or I'll be too bored. I'm sick of it.

I'm sick of feeling like I need to smoke even when I've smoked so much I have to vomit. I'm sick of having to stop everything to make sure I get to re-up or get to smoke in time. I'm sick of just being high all the time. So yesterday I threw away my carts, and I'll be giving away my nicer glass to some friends. I'm done with cannabis. I know I was happy and I had a life before I started, and I want that life back.

I'll be honest I'm afraid of not having it, I'm afraid of the pain, and I'm afraid of what will happen with my anxiety and depression. Last night was miserable and today is even worse. I can't stop sweating, I can't keep anything down because my stomach is alternating between cramping and starving and the second I eat or drink I throw it back up. 

But then I see all of you folks who have made it past where I am, I see all the folks with pain problems and anxiety and all these things I also deal with, and they're doing it, so I think I can quit too.",24,0

I've discovered some things about myself, grappled with my depression and I still continue to try and figure out what the heck good coping skills are. I often want to smoke just to make the pain go away. 

BUT

I am also learning that it is 100% OK not to be OK. I'm learning that my sorrow and my anxiety can't hurt me and that, sometimes, we have to just sit with our demons and enjoy starring at them over a warm cup of tea. They are you and you are them. Give them a name. Treat them kindly, like you want to be treated. Its OK to visit the dark parts of your mind now and then and give them a voice. They are there for a reason.

Weed made everything quiet. It stopped the voice in my head telling me I am not good enough, strong enough, talented enough, etc. But the reality is, no matter what you do, that voice is always going to be there. So, call it out and ask it why it says those things to you. Its terrifying, at first, but it wont always be. 

So, here are my three take-aways so far:

1.) Weed wont make things better. Ever.

2.) Talk to the demons inside you and ask them what they really need.

3.) Life is imperfect and you're not meant to be happy all the time.",18,0

A week into no lettuce, and it feels wild. I'd like to share a story that happened years ago, but I and my partner could have died because I was high behind the wheel. 


About 3 or so years ago, my partner and I went to Seattle for our first vacation as a couple. A harmless 12 hour drive, it was a piece of cake or so we though, just hop on the same interstate the whole way, a couple hundred miles, boom done. 

Wrong. 

We were about 30 minutes into to our ride, and my partner pulls out one of many, many Js for the road trip. We're going to Seattle! Let's roll up zooted, right? It's an easy drive, no problem. 

Well, after the first, and second J in the first hour of driving, I'm behind the wheel, and I am TOASTED. Like burnt to a crisp at the bottom of the overn toasted. Going 90+mph. My partner hands me to the J, she didn't ash it, no biggie, it happens, I'll ash it out the window quick. 

Well, the wind knocked the ash down to my pants, so I thought, no biggie, I'll look down super quick, wipe the ash off my pants and keep chiefing, I do this all of the time. 

Anyone wanna guess what happened next, I'll give you a hint, I was behind the wheel, looking down for about 6 seconds, going 90 on the highway. 

Cut to my partner screaming, me finally looking up after looking down at my pants the entire time wiping ashes off, and I swerved about a foot away from the cement guard rails. 

Panicked, and incredibly high, I over corrected, and swerved into the other lane of my side of the highway, started spinning, fishtailing, and finally ended up in a ditch on the side of the highway. 

Out of a stroke of luck, my little hatchback didn't flip over, and the worst damage was the tire chewed up off the rim. My car, as a stong gust of wind from being on it's side or upside down, and if it had rolled a foot further, we would have been dead. I'm serious. We were about a yard away from 3 white crosses attached to a sign on the highway; where three people ACTUALLY DIED on this road. 

You guys wanna know what happened after that? We went to get it towed, get the tire changed, and about 2 hours later we were back on the road. 4 hours later, we were back to smoking again. 

That should have been a sign for me to sober up, and cut this shit for good, it almost costed me my life. 

Sorry for the messy story, but I wanted to share with you guys a POV from someone who could have died from a drug that has yet to claim a life according to some. 

I still to this day have anxiety driving, as does my partner when I'm behind the wheel. Especially if I'm behind the wheel *high* 


PSA. Stoned driving is not sober driving, it's just as bad as drunk driving, and it's even worse that distracted driving. What you think could be a harmless flicking of ash on your pants, could cost you and your loved ones your lives, and you wouldn't even notice. 

To a week of sobriety, and hopefully many, many more.",25,0

Update: 2  staying present minded is a REAL task.   Jumped out of the shower.. feeling good- nice view out the window... grabbed the bud buster.. two turns-  wait. WTF AM I DOING?  

Wasnt even thinking.  Took the bag of loose bud and gave it to the old man next door.

I had a quite a few girlfriends after highschool, and have been infatuated with most. Have deeply cared for them all. And the crazy part is throughout all of those relationships, weed was my number one. I looked forward to getting high more than I looked forward to my girlfriends.

I didn't realize it, but when my life wasn't going right, weed was what I went to, to pick me up, to make me feel good. To force me to laugh when I needed to get my shit together. Made me comfortable coming home and getting on video games instead buckling down with school. It made not realize I need to find hobbies and socializing and cultivating a happy life. 

I’m thankful for God for giving me strength to preserver giving me so many chances and helping me meet this woman. And thankful my girlfriend for everything, and for being my strong support system and more. also I want to see my kids and grandkids. I feared an early death due to years of greasy munchies, heart or lung problems. I want to be happy and know I'm happy. Laugh and know I'm laughing, and not something making me laugh. I want to feel every bit of love for my girlfriend and not be numb to any emotions!

Now after 14 years I'm officially sober for 3 days, broke my bowls and bong and don't look back!! I’ve shed so many tears realizing the life/time I wasted.",32,0

Now, the opposite is occurring. No matter what time I get to bed, I usually wake up about three hours after. And regardless of how little sleep I got the night previous, I'm seemingly wide awake. 

Having off dreams just before I wake up. Wouldn't call them nightmares but they aren't exactly pleasant either. I remember this would happen on my first quitting attempt but after sometime, I'd fall back to sleep and wake up a short time after, again. Now I just can't at all, despite my best efforts. Hoping this passes soon. It seems like every time I make some progress in one department, I falter in another and it's really discouraging. 

I'm trying to take this all as a lesson that's way overdue. When I started smoking again in April of last year, I went all out because of the pandemic. And until I quit at mid august of this year, I was smoking copious amounts. So I'm assuming this is just my body giving me some well deserved pay back. If anything, this is just further solidifying the idea that I'll never do this shit to my body again. I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy. 

Just needed to rant a bit, I guess. Going to lay here for a little while longer and if I can't fall back to sleep, it's Ghost of Tsushima on three hours of sleep for me, I guess 😞",8,1

I started smoking weed everyday when I was 16, around that time I had lost my dad and started to smoke everyday. 

My passion in life is music and I started smoking weed when I would jam. When I first started smoking and playing music it felt like I had hit a new appreciation for it and playing the guitar.

It all fades. You slowly get slower, you don’t think clearly, you become dependent and isolated. 

For years, over a decade, I felt music and just life in general was so boring without weed. So many days I either avoided people because I was high, or would hangout with someone only to want to get high or to go home and smoke. It was horrible.

During the pandemic I got in a very toxic relationship and it set me weed paranoia over a cliff, so I stopped. 

This was around November of last year, and I’ve never been happier. Does it fix everything? No, I feel like I have weed induced adhd, but I’m not paranoid anymore, I’m much happier and feel so much more positive in my life.

I don’t go home and recap the day in a negative way, or criticize myself anymore, I’m just loving my brain as is.

kind of just screaming into the void here because this issue is embarrassing as hell, i mean they say all the time that weed is fine, weed is ok  
Started smoking when I was around 18 for fun. Moved to college out of state briefly at 20 and didnt have any connections, I didnt notice any difference. I assumed from then on that quitting would be easy and I could stop at anytime. 

At this point where I am, I have been smoking (self medicating basically) with weed for over 6 years. Im very very anxious as a person, and very easily sad/stressed and weed made it possible for me to do everything life requires of us (working out, actual job, cleaning/showering self care.) I would wake up and feel so anxious about my day/interacting with people/dealingwith life and smoke a ton of weed and immediately be in a fantastic mood.   
Covid made my habits so much worse. I smoke about 4-7 times a day. Obviously its costly and my job is commission based, so I don't make enough money to justify spending it on weed. I'm also constantly worried about long term effects, like memory(im in school) and what it could be doing to my lungs. It's been hanging over me like a weight everytime I take a hit of weed. 

I realized I'm addicted when I run out of grass and I spend the whole day pacing around my room and unable to focus or work on ANYTHING. usual symptoms, cant eat anything, food smells so unappetizing.... I basically just keep getting up every 10 minutes from my job to smoke what I don't have. Ill even scrape my grinder/the ashtray, and ill be doing this periodically any day im out of weed. It so pathetic, because I am usually such a motivated person on my own, and on days without it I turninto someone who cant do anything. 

I haven't gone more than 2 days in years, and it is very very hard and scary to be in this situation even if it might seem not that bad. for my health, for my sanity I want to I need to quit, but its so much harder than i thought. I cant even break a day or two, and in those two days Im trying im not getting ANYTHING else done. I quit before and noticed no difference, but now it actually seems impossible to live without smoking weed literally all the time.   


WHEN do these symptoms start to go away? How can i manage them while I wait? Do things go back to normal after you quit??? am i going to feel anxious forever now without weed?

For the first time, I recently admitted to a close friend, who I used to smoke with a lot, that I was addicted. I've admitted this to myself and talked with my therapist about it but to share it with a friend made it more real. And I think part of that is also me acknowledging that my relationship to cannabis is one of addiction, and smoking on occasion is not an option for me. 

I will be addicted to cannabis the rest of my life and every day I can make a choice to feed that addiction or not. For the last 10 days, I have made that choice the only thing I strive to do each day. I can do anything else I want guilt-free as long as it will support that choice. After reading a book about the neuroscience of addiction I really came to understand this disease, why I can never get enough, and how it is not my fault.

I use weed because it became a safe place for me away from my emotions, which in childhood I'd learned were something to be feared, ignored, or dismissed. The way I visualize it is that weed separates my head from my body. A nagging feeling in my body? Instead of processing it I could smoke and cut off those feelings at my neck. Weed was really effective at that and I am grateful to have found a tool to get me through that safely.

Being high was always a safe place for me. But that meant that when I wasn't high, the world was unsafe. And I always yearned for the return to safety. Unfortunately my brain tricks me into thinking the world is unsafe, whether it is or not, pushing me to get that fix that its addicted to. But I think I am ready to try something different.

I've quit many many times and have posted here at least three other times with throwaway accounts. The one I could find is here - [A letter to myself about weed and depression - 15 years smoking, 7 days without](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/77xuwi/a_letter_to_myself_about_weed_and_depression_15/), from 4 years ago which was my most sustained period of abstaining by choice.

I was 16 sneaking out with my friends. Being a high teenager, doing things you weren't supposed to do was so euphoric in itself. As habits do, they escalate through time. Throughout my 20s I became a daily pot head. Sometimes even wake-n-baking. I paid all my bills and went to work. But something was missing from my life. 

I turned 30 earlier in the year and when I was 29 I really wanted change in my life. 30 in my eyes is a big milestone and I did not want to be a single, depressed 30 year old pot head. 

I became distant from environments and people that used weed. 

I also stopped heavily drinking alcohol. Weed was my hangover cure. 

I was sexually abstinent in all ways (I am male).

I started exercising a lot. 

I cleaned up my diet. 

I educated myself on addiction, the patterns that I fell into. That I was using Pot to fill a void in my life. 

I started journaling writing down each day that you can do it, what your goals are, that you are proud of yourself. Be your own cheerleader. 

Made friends that aligned with my goals. 

Became a spiritual person. 

Realized what works for others doesn't work for me. 

Enjoy the feeling of being completely present. And working towards things that matter. Finding my purpose in life. 

Things start to have a positive domino effect when you keep up the practice and positivity. I am free of so many other bad destructive habits from quitting weed.

Another positive would be my performance is through the roof, and not to sound cocky but Im holding down the store on some days. (Think Safeway size). When I have work later in the day, that day is filled with anxiety, even if I hit the gym or go for a run beforehand.

I owe it all to the local addiction center.,"I've tried quitting weed countless times over the past 11 years. It's hard to get help for weed (for good) because there's that public perception ""it's just weed!"" And no one really takes the addiction seriously.

My insurance covers the costs of an addiction center I live near. Most people are there for other harder drugs and alcohol, and they treat weed addictions just as seriously. Even if weed isn't as harmful as other recreational drugs, there is overlap in all of these substance abuse issues.

I attend group therapy 3x a week for 2 hours a session, and a weekly 1 on 1 therapy session there. It's nearly impossible to put down the weed by sheer willpower alone. Having professional help is so important. I highly recommend it if you have access. 

The biggest part of tackling an addiction head on is to identify the underlying cause. Therapy helps a lot with this. I think the underlying cause of my own addiction is my low self esteem, which I am working through.

The hardest part of my recovery from weed is not weed itself, but it is facing my mental health issues I had been covering up for over a decade.

So far I feel fine, but I have severe anxiety that I never had before. My anxiety shows up in the form of knots in my stomach that never go away. I don't know if this will go away over time, or maybe I have some anxiety disorder that I've been self medicating for. 

Right now I'm in the process of retraining my brain so that I'm not constantly thinking about weed. I don't feel ""cravings"" or urges to smoke weed. I just think ""wow what a great time to be high"" sometimes. But these thoughts are fleeting. 

I'm hoping to post again in a few months to share more progress.",6,0

I've been smoking weed off and on for the last 6-7 years. Most recently I've been smoking weed every night for the past year (a couple of week long breaks scattered in there). I wake up every day and want to quit, but as it gets closer and closer to nighttime, when I usually smoke, my motivation wanes. Back in June and July I made 2 different attempts to quit. On the first attempt I woke up, knew what I had to do and threw away all of my stuff. Grinder, bowls, weed, everything. I was able to stay sober for 2 weeks. Then I caved. I said I would buy some weed and wouldn't smoke nearly as much as I was (1 small bowl in the evenings instead of 2-3 fat bowls). After a couple of nights I was right back to where I was. Fast forward a couple of weeks and my stash was waning (only about a week's worth left) and I tossed everything I had and tried quitting again. This time I wasn't as successful and texted my dealer the next day and stopped at the smoke shop after meeting them to pickup some glass and grinder. Since then I have not made another attempt to quit. I'm scared that I won't be able to control myself and will get into a cycle of throwing my supplies away and then going to buy more. And that scares me because I'm in grad school and spending $20 on a bowl and another $10 on a grinder, in addition to the money I spend on weed really adds up fast. 

I've spend time really thinking hard about the reasons why I want to quit and put it into a short letter to myself, which I then placed near my stash. It didn't work. I read it and thought ""That's nice, but I want to get high."" The person I most recently dated and my friends are both sympathetic with my struggles, are also quick to reassure me that there isn't anything wrong with my smoking habits. While I appreciate their non-judgement, I have a problem with my smoking habits. Sure, if I could smoke a bowl at 10 and fall asleep around midnight everything would be ok and I probably wouldn't be writing this. But for me one bowl at 10 turns into a 2nd bowl at midnight, and a 3rd bowl at 1 or 2. I could fall asleep earlier than I do but I keep fighting the urge to sleep because I want to keep getting high. Sometimes I feel like a crack addict. Outside sitting on the sidewalk nodding off, but sitting there with a bowl in my hand just to keep getting that sense of euphoria. 

I know that quitting weed won't make all of the problems in my life go away, but to be honest, most of the problems in my life right now are directly related to weed. I'm groggy for the first few hours I wake up (time that I need to be studying). My teeth are stained and my gums are slightly inflamed. I can't do cardio like I could in the past because my lungs can't hang. I spend too much money on fast food because I'm too lazy to cook. I eat a bunch of junk food after smoking and wake up feeling like shit. Sometimes I turn down opportunities to socialize because I'd rather sit at home and smoke instead. I have hobbies that I enjoy but don't have time for them because I end up cramming most of my studying and school work on the weekends. 

Anyway, sorry for writing a book here. I just needed to get that off my chest. Maybe some of you can relate and have some tips for me. I don't really know where to begin. Once I throw away my stash how do I keep myself from going back out and buy more?

There is hope.,"I recently found this subreddit, and I see so many daily posts from you beautiful souls about being x number of days/weeks/months sober. Having quit a year and a half ago, I wanted to share with you my story with weed and give you HOPE! If I can do this, you can do this. You are worth it and your progress may not look like a straight line (mine didn't), but if you keep showing up for yourself, there is light at the end of this tunnel.

I smoked the first time when I was 17 and pretty instantly fell in love. I loved the way it made me feel. It was a wonderful alternative to alcohol as I saw it. My friends were all doing it, and they all pushed the idea that weed wasn't addictive. It was easier to me to acquire than alcohol before I was 21 too.

* Ages 17-18, I smoked maybe **once a month** when it was offered to me.
* Ages 18-23, my usage varied but I'd say for most of that period I was smoking pretty much **every day, multiple times a day**.
* Ages 24-25, was working abroad in Asia and only got my hands on it a **handful of times**. (I almost didn't want to go because I knew I wouldn't be able to smoke there...)
* Ages 25-27, didn't feel as addicted to it as I did when I left for Asia but usage slowly climbed back up to **daily use** as I was in a relationship with someone that smoked often and all my friends smoked often
* Ages 28-29, my friends in the new city I lived didn't really smoke and so I mostly did it when I was going out. Maybe a **few times a month** at this point

The context of my life was the biggest thing that affected my weed usage because I felt I had very little control over it. The hardest part was being honest with myself about this. For so long it was so easy to admit to myself I had control. From the outside, I was doing fine. I had friends, I have always done well at my job. But my relationship with weed never sat right with me.

Here's what I noticed:

* Diminished return
* I couldn't really say 'no' to it if it was offered
* Unproductive (I'd say I was going to smoke and go to the store and I'd fall asleep or get distracted because I got too high)
* Stayed in relationships I shouldn't have stayed in
* Kept me around people I shouldn't have been friends with
* Needed it to have fun, sometimes just to be okay
* All-consuming (if I got it in my head that I wanted to smoke, I would move mountains to make it happen, even if it meant inconveniencing people or derailing plans)
* **Kept me from genuinely connecting** with my friends (Not just ""woo let's get fucked up kinda way"" but in real, mundane ways where I got to find out how their day was or if their boss was still bothering them. High me never thought to ask those questions), family, and community
* Made me crave sexual intimacy and following those cravings was destructive to friendships
* Short-term memory loss and just overall feeling of my brain not being as sharp

It was honestly a miracle that I was able to stop smoking. If you had told me five years ago that I would eventually quit, I would've thought you were crazy. A lot of things had to align for this to happen for me. Weed was my kryptonite.

I don't have a lot of tips for how to stop, unfortunately. Really the thing that did it for me was getting into a 12 step program for another addiction. After 2 years of recovery from that addiction, it became undeniable that my relationship with weed would never be what I wanted it to be. After quitting and starting back up again several times (trying to make it work), the most recent time I have quit with no intentions of returning. Finally pulling that trigger feels so good.

Being in a 12 step program, having that supportive community, people who understand and have tools, and working the steps, higher power, all of it. I'm not saying it's for everyone but for me, that is how I was able to quit and stay away for so long. I could not do it alone. My will was not enough, I had to have support.

Ironically, after quitting a couple of my good friends have started smoking daily, and I'm so grateful to not be under that constant pressure anymore. I know it would've made hanging out with them so difficult if I was still smoking.

I also recently dated (just a couple months) a guy that smoked all day every day (I wasn't completely aware of that until a few weeks in). We really dug each other, but he would show up to every date high and it was so off-putting to me. I had empathy, of course. But I no longer want to be intimate with someone who feels like they have to be in an altered state of mind just to function. I'm not resentful, just SO GRATEFUL that I'm no longer there in my own life.

My life isn't ruled by getting into an altered state of consciousness. It makes it harder in different ways but ultimately so fulfilling.

I just landed the job of my dreams. I have a small house that I love. I have better relationships with my friends and family than I ever have before. I have committed to being of service to my community and all the people in my life whenever I can. I'm not perfect. I still have hard days. But life is SO much better.

**TLDR: Smoked daily for a good portion of my 20s. Quit with the help of a 12 step program (for a different addiction). Now, my life isn't ruled by getting into an altered state of consciousness. It makes it harder in different ways but ultimately so fulfilling. If I can do this, you can do this. Good luck.**",94,0

852,2021-09-14 07:05:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/po0lh1/day_1_how_to_approach_the_first_week/,Day 1 - How to approach the first week.,"Hey everyone, 

I'm back to day one, having successfully quit for 70 days (the longest I'd done before that, in 11 years, was 5 days - not by choice)

Since I'm restarting the journey, I wanted to describe how I am approaching day 1, so that it hopefully inspires others quitting.

The first week is the hardest; a lot of it's ""in your head"". Doing as many as the below as you can will make things actually easier, and when you build some momentum, your brain will be working WITH you.

Please do as many of these as you can, it WILL make things easier - if you can't do any of them, don't worry. Start implementing when you can.

I would be greatful if people engage with this - feedback, positive or negative; you're own tips and tricks etc.

1. Change/wash your bedding. 

I cannot emphasise the importance of this enough. Even if they were fresh yesterday. Change your bedding. Your bed will feel MUCH comfier.

If you can, do this everyday for the first week. You may sweat, but again, you want the room to be as comfy as possible.

2. Make you're room COLD. It's easier to sleep in a cold room, and it's comfier to be in a cold room but warmed up by your bed

3. Stop drinking caffeine 12pm. The half life is 12 hours, the quarter life is 18 hours. Hard fact. I used to drink a monster at like 11pm.

4. Go for a run, or at least a walk. I don't care if you've never done it before - do the Couch to 5k programme. The first week of this has you lightly jogging for 60 seconds, walking for 90 - 8 times in total. If you can't do this, walk for half an hour.

This is seriously underestimated and difficult to comprehend when you don't do it. It helps you focus your brain, use up stress, get some endorphins etc. It's also a tangible beneficial habbit for you to replace weed with. It gets much easier, very quickly. They say don't excersise right before bed, so maybe that's something to consider. 

We're not talking sprinting here, but trust me, If you weigh 20 stone and you can only slowly walk, you're still lapping everyone who's still sat down.

5. Start looking into your diet a bit. I ate a lot of fried chicken when I stopped the first time - binges are okay sometimes if it's stopping you smoking...but it's worth just starting with at least one meal where you've got a nice, healthy balance of protein, fat and carbs. There's a lot of BS around diet now...low fat, low card, fasting.. whatever you're poison, try and get 1g of protein per lean body mass...get yourself AT LEAST 20percent of your diet from fat, and the rest carbs. Essentially, balance carbs and fat to what suits you, just never go below 20percent fat

6. Try and list the benefits of quitting 

7. BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK - this is free, you can implement it easier, and it will make a massive difference. If you cant do any of the above yet, please, PLEASE, do this...

FRAMING - when you talk, to other people or in your own head, talk about yourself as a nobe-stoner. You're not TRYING to quit, you HAVE quit. 

""I don't smoke anymore"" instead of ""I'm trying to give up"". I quit smoking cigarettes almost instantly by doing this.  A lot of the time, Its impossible to see yourself as NOT smoking, your identity is a smoker. Your brain works to keep you into which ever frame you give yourself. The power of your self talk is really quite important.

Anyway, day 1 myself - wish me luck 😉

Why I started again - I had a joint, and instantly I went from someone who doesn't smoke weed, back to fully addicted ""I can't sleep without it, I can't imagine quitting""",32,0

Long time lurker, first time poster here. I completely stopped doing weed (and other drugs) a bit over five months ago after i had a psychotic episode induced by weed and various other drugs. Before that i was a daily user for about two years. I started smoking due to my physical and mental health situation (chronic illness and personal issues) and it was a way for me to momentarily escape my problems. I made some great progress during the last couple of months, finished my law degree, started studying music, founded a band, got a job and so on. Despite all of this my self perception is pretty negative. Recently i broke my arm and i will now need a surgery, the success of which is unsure and in case it fails my ability to play my instrument might be seriously impaired. Due to this and other personal issues I feel like I have reached a breaking point and the past couple of days all I could think of is getting high. I don't want to ruin my progress but I see little other alternatives right now, I feel like I am loosing my mind.

We are all gonna make it, just don't give up!","It took maybe 10 attempts for me to be able to break free. Each time the number of days sober was between 3-7 days. 

Biggest tips:
- Go to a MA meeting (can do it on zoom these days I believe) 
- meditation every morning
- journal gratefulness every morning 
- I have psychotherapy every week, helps me understand myself better and who I want to be.
- really paint a horrible image of weed in your head. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of staying a stoner, and how you will never reach your potential being a pothead. Therapy helped with this, really hitting the nail on the head and helping me realise who I want to be, and how weed would only stop me from being the person I am capable of being. (Confidence, anxiety, being chilled out, being healthy etc)
- if you fail an attempt don't beat yourself up. This is very difficult. It takes time to break free. Just keep at it. I promise you that you can do it.",202,0

ive come to the opinion that for a looottt of people consistently smoking cannabis is not a wise thing to do

in my view just because a drug gives us a chemically induced euphoria for a couple hours doesn't mean its a good thing, like most drugs. when weeds used consistently it has an illusionary nature which puts a band aid over pain temporarily but dampens processes that are needed to be happy and free, and stops us doing the day to day things and hard work that happiness is derived from",10,0

     I’m currently 18 years old and moving on to 19 pretty soon. I’ve been smoking since 8th grade but smoking turned into daily smoking around my sophomore year. Thank fuck I graduated high school heh. Long story short I started smoking for the fun and now it’s turned into a terrible dependency that fights with my concept of if I’m “addicted that bad”. I’ve never felt anxiety when I smoked ever, but now it’s worse than ever but I’m still drawn to smoke consistently throughout the day. For some fucking reason too I’ve developed social anxiety and I used to be an asshole and not understand what people were talking about but yeah.. I know now. Weed fucked my high school transcript , I’m stuck door dashing and wanna get my life started , but I don’t see myself doing that with weed, and I also don’t see myself quitting weed. I’d really like to quit now Before it becomes even worse. Thank you for anyone who read this, I just really needed to get this off my chest. (Sorry for bad grammar)",1,0

At the end of last year, after a long year of no responsibilities on unemployment, I was homeless for 3 months after getting kicked out of my parents house, out of my mind basically and went to rehab for 4 months and then did 3 months of sober living.

The thing is I love weed, really stimulant prescription medication, having no responsibilities, and the year in general is what pushed everything over the edge to where I was high all the time and an asshole. But when used correctly weed helped me enjoy life and get out of my head and really just enjoy the world for what it is.

Anyways I really want to smoke again to see if it’s really an issue. The biggest thing stopping me is all the aa stuff that life could get even worse than it was, the fact that my parents spent 120k on rehab, and the embarrassment of giving up my sobriety.

One year ago, I never imagined that I would have a clean, free life. I always saw myself putting getting high over everything else. I never saw myself being able to do anything without having weed in my life. I used to do absolutely everything high. My entire life was about weed. I didn’t realize how much of my life was on hold because I would not stop smoking. I thought that I was “functional” and was a better person when I smoked. When in reality I was way more selfish, moody and introverted. I put my education, my job and even my relationship on a back burner because getting high was honestly more important to me. 

Today, I can proudly say that girl is gone. That girl who hid in her house to get high alone is gone. The girl who almost lost all of her friends because she’d rather smoke alone than be around people is gone. The girl who turned down spending time with her boyfriend because she had plans to smoke is long gone. The apathetic girl who almost smoked away a college education is gone! 

I am so proud of the journey that I am on, however it is not over. Now that I am clean it seems as if the clouds have cleared away and I can see a future for myself. A future I never imagined possible a year before. I married my college sweetheart who stuck by me through all of this, stopped putting off finishing my college degree and started applying myself in my job. All of this has happened for me within 12 months all because of one change I made. One decision to put down the weed for good and not look back.

This group has been so incredibly supportive towards me. This sub has been there for me when I was at my lowest and encouraged me to fight though. I am so glad I found this sub, joined and shared my thoughts when I was feeling tempted. It’s been an amazingly tough, challenging and beautiful year. I’m finally excited to see what my future has for me.",32,0

Currently on day 12 without weed after about two and a half years of daily smoking, with my longest break in that time probably being 5 days or so. Kinda can’t believe I’ve done it…my therapist had been telling me forever that this daily habit doesn’t serve me but it wasnt until 13 days ago that it really sunk in and I felt like I wanted to make a change. Especially now that I’ve graduated from college I realize how much I wasted the last half of my college experience and I will forever regret that and be upset that weed took away my motivation to actually take advantage of college, rather than watch it pass by as I smoked with my friends thinking we somehow knew better than everyone. Though I do commend weed for helping me through recovering from an eating disorder, it eventually stopped serving me. 

Anyway…my question is, do you think it’s ever possible to use weed again, in a “smoking every once in a while” kind of way, after being so wrapped up in smoking? While I’m extremely happy to have quit, it kind of pains me to think that I’ll never smoke again, especially after having been such a stoner. Idk it feels like that part of my identity is gone and now I don’t know who I am without smoking.

I'm happy to see this subreddit exists! I'm a long time weed user, it's been about 10 years of daily use. For the past few years I'd go through about a gram of shatter per week for dabs. Exclusively dabs and edibles, no flower. I quit recently due to moving to an illegal state, but before that I thought about quitting because I couldn't get access to high-quality product, and I started to not really catch a buzz no matter how much I dabbed.

It's been three and a half weeks since my last dab. Surprisingly, for the first two weeks I felt fine. I used to have a medical card for anxiety and insomnia, and to my surprise I wasn't anxious at all and had no issues falling asleep once I quit. I thought I was in the clear! However, I did have some lack of appetite, issues focusing due to my ADHD, and overall lack of motivation / irritability.

This past weekend, I felt like I got hit by a truck. Sore throat, body aches, fatigue, so I was worried I had Covid and took a test which came back negative. I felt better taking OTC pain meds, but yesterday I slept like 10 hours and then fell asleep for another 3 hour nap. I was exhausted. Today I feel nauseous, achy, and demotivated. I finally realized, is this possibly weed withdrawal?

I'm just not sure because from what I read online, the withdrawal symptoms are supposed to be at their worst immediately once you stop consumption. Is it normal to have delayed withdrawal symptoms?

I did take a break a few years ago and it took me about 45 days to have a negative piss test. I'm going to the store tomorrow to get a test and see what comes back, but I'm almost certain I'll still test positive.

Thanks in advance for any responses. Appreciate your help!",1,1

I'm writing this to celebrate 22 days without smoking weed. Without you, I would not have made it this far. You gave me so much strength on my worst days during withdrawal.

I feel like I left most of the fog behind me. And with fog, I don't just mean brain fog. I'm talking about all the horrible withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, paranoia and depression.

I'm getting my life together more and more, my finances look way better, I take so much more care of myself and I think this is only the beginning of a great chapter in my life. Finally a great one after all the shit I've been through.

There will come foggy areas again on my way up, definitely. But I will challenge them and I will not produce more fog by falling back into my addiction. I will keep on climbing until I reach the top. And after that, I will challenge the next mountain. I want to grow and become the best version of myself.

I’ve been talking to a psychiatrist ever since I lost my grandfather just 2 months before my dad passed but I haven’t been talking to him much lately cause I don’t have the heart to tell him I’ve been drinking and smoking every single day more or less since my dad has passed. I know it’s been numbing me from some of the pain I feel but I don’t want to stop. Before my dad passed away I always joked around and laughed with my dad and bust his balls for my own humour sometimes. Now that’s all gone and it doesn’t feel the same. He was my best friend, I could tell my dad literally anything about my life or ask him anything and he would always help me if I went to him for fatherly advice. I still have my mom and brother, I love and cherish them more than anything in this world but I don’t feel like I can go to my mom or younger brother for the same type of advice my dad would give me. Because of that I guess I feel more closed off to people. Before my dad passed he said to my brother and I a few simple words when we asked him what he wants from us when he goes, he said “life goes on boys, I just want you boys to be happy in life.” He’s given us anything we could ever of asked for and I’ll always remember everything he’s sacrificed for us and is the best dad I could’ve ever asked for.

879,2021-09-13 14:49:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pnlqpn/100_days/,100 Days.,"Hi Everyone, today is my 100th day since quitting Weed. I just wanted to share a little of my story and some reflections and things I have realised in the last 100 days.

I am 35 years old now, and started when I was 21. It felt like such a good fit at first, I felt like I had finally found my peer group, my community and my identity. I proudly self identified as a stoner for a long, long time never realising how much it was inhibiting me, and how much my use was really just  me endlessly shooting myself in the foot, over and over again.

When I first quit 100 days ago, I was really undecided and confused about whether it would be forever, or just for a while, or as long as I could manage it.  I thought maybe I'd allow myself a 'treat day' some time in the future or something like that.

About half way into quitting I found this group, I had never really used reddit before for anything. But I was blown away by how much strength, compassion and wisdom there was in here from all of you. So, so many of your stories have deeply resonated with me, and my relationship with weed. It really helped me realise the extent of my own denial, and now...that I can never go back to it. I have realised that I have so much more in common with this community than I do with the community of people still smoking.

Over the last 100 days I have come to realise how absolute and all encompassing my cannabis use was. Every extra bit of money I had would go on weed. I have turned down so many opportunities over the last 14 years because I wanted to either save my money for weed, or I had already spent it on weed. I used to genuinely be baffled by how people had money for restaurants, taxis, holidays, going for drinks, visiting people in other cities, nice things, good food, just normal every day stuff. I didn't realise for so long that when you don't spend every extra bit of cash you have on weed, a whole lot of stuff opens up to you.

I have realised that my life is nowhere near where I want it to be, and that this is the first time ever I have been able to think about 'what do I actually want my life to be like'. Without it being framed by organising my life around cannabis use.

I have realised how much I have depended on weed to regulate my emotions, how so many little negative thoughts, or feelings have been smoked away. I have had my fair share of trauma and abuse in my life too. Weed was definitely a coping mechanism for me, and an effective one too. But I don't want to rely on it any more. I want to feel the things I am supposed to feel, and feel them fully. Not smoke up to take the edge off them, or just obliterate myself into not feeling them at all.

I really feel like a fog has lifted from me and that having a little bit of sobriety under my belt has allowed me to think about weed differently. I have been thinking about quitting for a long time but genuinely couldn't imagine my life without it. It just seemed impossible, like that would be someone else's life. Now, I really can't imagine ever going back.

Thanks to all of you for your wisdom, honesty and support.

This group is incredible.

Im 34y now and the last 8 years i smoked Amnesia Haze from morning till evening, like 8 joints or so a day. On 15 april i quit cold turkey and loved that i didnt feel tired and my body felt awake/alive. Didnt had any problem sleeping alot or anything else strange. Untill after month 2 i started experiencing very bad anxiety attacks (never been anxious in my life before, very extrovert). Trembling, shortness of breath, dizzy, brain fog, everything. It stayed with me for like a whole month every day and it was dreadfull. After that month i felt like i was getting beter, no more anxiety and i was strong again. Great. But on month 5 (last few weeks) all the problems came back again and have been struggeling with it for 3 weeks now. It is horrible. Shaking in the morning, getting shortness of breath, trembling like something is about to happen and when it is over i feel like shit the entire day. Sometimes it makes me think i have a lung disease or something with my heart but reading all the storys make me realise it still is PAWS. Moral of the story: Quit and never start again. Ive read when u start again while having this shit it will come back at a later date even worse then it was. I wish i never touched that crap. Quitting after using for a long periode of time is the most horrible thing, i wouldnt wish it to my worse enemy.",7,0

My wife and I smoke basically every night after the kids go down, watch a show and relax after what is usually a long day.

But I recently got offered a job and they are requiring a drug test (I know, what the hell!). It's a really great job and it's something I really want, and so of course I quit smoking cold turkey. I haven't had any problems whatsoever with quitting - no withdrawal, only a slight desire to smoke that is easily overcome with hopes of the new job.

Part of me feels like no time has passed and I just stopped smoking weed last week, but another part of me realizes how much I've changed for the better in only 100 days. I'm starting to forget what it felt like to be high and disconnected from reality on a regular basis.

Some positive changes I've experienced:

* I'm more in touch with my emotions. I'm somewhat of a crier now, which is a big shocker to people that knew me before I quit smoking weed. I viscerally feel my emotions instead of tamping them down and ignoring them. It was extremely uncomfortable and overwhelming to work through old emotions and grapple with new emotions at first, but I'm starting to reach a point where my emotions are settling down and I'm getting used to processing them in a healthy manner (thanks therapy!).

* I'm finding joy from everyday beauty and experiences! I read a book recently where the author talks about how repeated usage of THC affects your cannabinoid receptors and makes it difficult for your brain to produce dopamine unless you're high (hopefully I explained that correctly lol). I can honestly say my dopamine levels have returned to ""normal"" and reached a point where I find nature absolutely mind-blowing and can find pleasure in my day-to-day life. My existence doesn't feel so monotonous and worthless when I see the setting sun filtering through the leaves of the tree outside my window or I manage to get an incredible photo of water droplets on wildflowers after a thunderstorm.

* I'm more in touch with my reality and time. I felt like I was floating through life when I was smoking. But when I was sober during short tolerance breaks, my life felt unbearably slow and I felt an extreme amount of pressure to catch up on my life before I dove back into smoking. I'm not swinging between those two extremes anymore, which honestly feels like such a relief at this point. I'm trying to just exist and enjoy where I am in life now. I'm still learning how to do this - I'm definitely not a master at being in the here and now. But I can see my progress and I feel so much more grounded.
     
I would be lying to all of you if I said the past 100 days has been all rainbows and butterflies. Life is difficult and quitting any substance is a big transition. My relationships are evolving - some for the better and some are collapsing under the weight of who I used to be and what I used to do. I'm not going to lie, I was close to relapsing a few times this past month. I've been dealing with now chronic health issues and I'm living in an environment with temptations. Sometimes I've felt like it would just be easier to smoke and get rid of all my worries, but I remind myself of all the good changes I've experienced and remember that smoking will make me feel 10x worse by the second or third day of being back in the clutches of weed. I'm glad I pushed through and continue to stay sober. I'm stronger for it and can really appreciate my sobriety now.

Thank you for this community. I'm so grateful for all of you! You all have been such a support for me, and reading your stories and experiences has helped keep me on track. Good luck on your sobriety journeys - we can do this, one day at a time!! ❤️",11,0

I thought I was making good progress and I was keeping away from it but i broke down this weekend. Had friends and family questioning why i stopped smoking and my awnser has always been the same ""I wasnt being productive, wasnt hitting my goals, couldnt talk to people and I felt like I smoked to  much and was almost always high"". Than pretty much got told how even before this I slowed down on smoking and how I should just enjoy my weekends and time off work. Than the lil demon in the back of my brain was like you know what maybe they are right. And so unfortunately on day 20 of my journey I faltered and smoked twice. I thought it actually wouldnt be that bad the high wasnt that great  I was really bored and stuck on why I even smoked at all, I hated it. The day after when I woke up I felt like absolute shit. I feel like shit today too. Like i haven't slept in a week. I have zero energy and at the same time feel horrible about giving in. Now dont get me wrong I dont blame anyone for asking me questions or pointing out the fact that I did indeed go from burning like 300+ a month off smoking plants to like 50 bucks a month of vaping oil carts. I get the amount I was smoking near the end wasnt that bad but like it was still negatively effecting my life. I just wanted to be free and learn how to deal with life without needing weed in it. 

Anyway it's been two days since than  and I know I'll prob not have any real withdrawl symptoms from this slip  should I reset completely or go with days in recovery idk I'm tryna make that decision. I gotta not listen to that lil demon whispering in my head man.

One thing that became very evident was how unconscious weed makes me, and causes me to dwell in the past/future too much.

One of the biggest tools I've learnt in sobriety is bringing myself to the now, and bringing everything to my consciousness rather than pushing it away.

Last night, after smoking though, I found it impossible to stay in the 'now'. My mind was racing back to the past, worries of the future and I just couldn't get 'grounded'. I would almost put my thoughts into a 'psychotic' like state where I didn't know what was real or not anymore. Lots of irrational fears came up, and I was doing somersaults in my brain for no reason. 

I'm wondering whether a lot of my rumination problems came from abusing weed at a young age - it seems it's hard wired me to get stuck in this 'worry overdrive' mode, which I find very difficult to break out of.  After 2 very long breaks, it seems smoking even a little bit forces me back into this unconscious and paranoid state.

Today I'm mostly fine. I can focus on the task at hand, and I'm thinking irrationally - although I did wake up with some feelings of dread which I sometimes get after smoking.

Thought I'd share. I've realised my new life (mindfulness. meditation and awareness) does not align with smoking weed anymore. It just distorts my new lifestyle. I've lived many years in total fantasyland, and quite possibly, missed some of the best years of my life.",11,0

1 year ago, the only thing i could think of, was weed weed weed... and it totally made me crazy or well i felt like it... but yesterday i barely really thought about smoking.. i just tried to shut off my brain and enjoy my time...  


comming into day 2... im unsure of how much sleep i got this night, but i dont feel drained.. and im not groggy.. which is really nice.. i am actually feeling quite good about myself, compared to alittle over 1 year ago..  


1 of the big differences between me stopping now and back then, is that i finally after 5 horrible years am free from my ex harrassing me mentally.. and also im not living at my mom anymore... i do for the first time in many years feel free to think and believe what i want to believe in.. and not having these stress factors really makes it easier for me, to quit cannabis.  


So to you guys and gals out there, if you try to find the root of your stress, eliminate it... because having that stress and going through withdrawel is the worst thing ever..  


Back when i had the 192 days of sobriety, i really felt the depression and withdrawel in the first 4-6 weeks and is like it never really fully went away..  
But thinking back now, im unsure if my ""withdrawel"" really came from weed, because thinking back, i feel much more like my ex was the root of my symptoms.. ofc there is some withdrawel symptoms comming from weed, but it really feels like my ex made my symptoms go through the roof..

I'm rounding the bend on half a year clean, but it is getting much harder. My wife was recently diagnosed with cervical cancer, and her hysterectomy was last week. It went well, and the Dr says he saw no sign of cancer outside her cervix, but we won't know for sure for two weeks. 

The stress has been gradually increasing for around 2 months, and reached a fever pitch during the last week. I stayed in a hotel for 5 days while she had her surgery and recovered enough to go home. I'm honestly surprised I didn't cave then. There was a dispensary two blocks away. At one point I actually had to go in and get her some edibles to manage her pain. And I did it, and I'm still sober, but- fuck, this is getting hard. I thought I'd gotten past the daily cravings and bargaining with myself. 

I know she needs the best of me right now, fully available and sober. And that's what she's going to get. I just need to vent. I'm burning out, and I don't have any support system (no, I don't have any friends or family in the area) to rely on. It's just me. 

I'm hoping that this will get easier. We get her lab reports in two weeks, and if the cancer really is just in her cervix than she's almost certainly in the clear. And then maybe the pressure will let up, and it'll be less of a daily struggle. But I'll be honest, I would give non-essential portions of my anatomy to be able to use cannabis without it being a problem. I just know that I can't. So.... Yeah, that's about it.

910,2021-09-12 21:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pn5pp6/36_days_and_some_notes/,36 Days and some notes,"This is my 5th withdrawal. 

* First binge was after 3 months of usage of roughly a small joint a day. Didn't use for 15 months after it. 
* The second binge was after 3 months, about half a joint a day too, but often hash infused. Didn't use for 5 months after it stopped.
* The third was after 6 months of use. I went hardcore, tried to one-up myself every day, smoking all day. Chasing that one great high before I quit for good. Every day I snoozed it and it went on for 6 months. Stayed clean for 2 months before I relapsed. 
* 4th binge was about 2 months, the shortest. Quit and immediately went home to my parents to avoid relapse. It lasted 2-3 months, before I relapsed again, a few weeks after returning from my parents'. 
* 5th and final binge was the longest -- starting last November till the first week of August. Once again trying to get that one last, clean, epic high before I quit for good. It never came and I kept going back, kicking the can down the road, to ""tomorrow"".

The thing with me, unlike many here probably, is that I knew it was bad and I had to quit from the very beginning. Even in my first binge, I was constantly telling myself that ""today will be one last high and that'll be all"" but I relapsed the very next day, every single day. If I am being honest, there was a side of me that did this with a smirk. I think my ego didn't like being crippled and wanted to show it can do whatever it wants. This has also been the cause of my perpetual indiscipline -- I have never had a good routine, a regular sleep schedule or diet. Part of me is still proud of it -- of being a nomad in every sense of it. 

But as I have gotten older, turning 26 in a couple of months, I see I have less and less energy to keep this up. I am running past the limits of my physical and mental self and it is getting exhausting. I need some discipline and quitting weed has been the first step. This time I do feel I have more resolve --- I have done enough weed, it finally feels ""boring"" ya know. Given my relapses, the four main ones and practically hundreds of others from my daily promises to quit from ""tomorrow"", I cannot afford to be too cocky. I can tell from my previous relapses that one hit is enough to revive my addiction. 

Getting back to life has been hard. I have had near-zero productivity since I quit. The first week was super difficult. But things have gotten better. No more night sweats now and food is generally palatable. Coffee still launches me into a panic attack. My sleep schedule is non-existent. I slept at 9 AM today and woke up at 4 PM. This makes it hard to build any sort of work-life balance or routine. Someone, please help me out here! I have started to cook for myself and eating out less and that has been quite rewarding. I have been binging TV shows and it gives a sense of continuity and fills my loneliness. I have also been spending too much time on reddit/youtube and I need to curb that next. My feet get swollen, so do my hands. I think my testosterone went up a lot during this time so I am irritable and I fear I am balding. I have a lot of weird pains throughout the body -- especially in my chest. I want to go to the doctor and get it checked up but I have had these medical panics before and know that there is nothing wrong and the doc will send me back. This is another PAWS symptom that I have to wrestle through.  I still fail drug tests so there is still a lot of buildup in my body that I need to expel. But I hope I can get it all out soon. Reading r/leaves has been another motivator. Knowing relapse is right around the corner and seeing other perfectly reasonable humans who have made the same mistakes I did alleviates the guilt a bit.

The guilt is still there though. I try to move on but it is just too much to ignore. Post-graduation from college, roughly the last 4 years, I have been stoned > 50% of the time. I smoked in-between jobs and in-between relocations and that always made things 1000x more stressful. The reason I ended the first 2 of my binges was because of relocation and not because of conscious abstinence. I feel sad knowing that I wasted a good chunk of my early productive professional life. But in some ways, knowing me, I was bound to do something stupid like this. I have taken great pride in my spontaneousness and indiscipline and that finally caught up with me in the form of this addiction.

I don't want to see r/leaves become another r/NoFap. I understand quitting weed can have tremendous positive effects. But none of it is automatic in my humble opinion. Quitting weed is the first step. It is a step towards greater awareness. Once you are aware, there is still a fuckton of work to do. But at least you can see and acknowledge it. Yes, mediation and exercise seem to help a lot but being in a state of mind to exercise or meditate is itself an astronomical challenge. I feel it is a classic case of survivorship bias --- people who are predisposed to do it are probably a lot better at recovery than many of us are so no wonder it works out for them. Still, that's no excuse though. I really miss the old me dearly --- the me that was thinking of interesting problems in the shower or the me that was present at my job and hustled to work better than others or the me that was trying to do something special. I am not sure if I will ever recover from this fully. But on the same note, I realize there was some underlying sense of disappointment, with my career options, with my relationships, with the world, that led that the drug to get a hold of my soul in the first place. I hope I can work on these basal factors next. 

I encourage everyone to share their withdrawal symptoms and timelines as it has been the single biggest aid for me in navigating this vice. Knowing what you feel is normal given the addiction makes it easier to confront the challenge. Otherwise, it is natural to fall into the spiral of attributing it all to yourself and get more depressed. If we can all be sincere and articulate about what we are going through, we can collectively build a map of this treacherous landscape and escape it for good. 

Stay strong my friends.",3,0

I've been smoking for somewhere between 7 and 9 years, every day at about 1g per day.

I started because it was a way to soothe my anxiety and finally be able to sleep and relax. Unfortunately it has caused me to suffer from severe memory impairment, social anxiety, general forgetfulness, and I've completely lost control of my eating habits. I have gained a significant amount of weight since I started smoking, and and while I am confident that I can lose it, I am not confident I will recover otherwise. Every time I try to quit I only make it about 3 or 4 days before I before I succumb to it, mostly because of the sleep issues and anxiety. My longest streak was 12 days. It was miserable, lonely, and exhausting.

Is there another support I am missing or something else I can do?  Unfortunately at the moment I am unable to afford the counseling services I was getting for my anxiety.  I have started to lose a lot of faith in myself as I recently had to turn down a great job opportunity due to my memory issues. The job requires a huge amount of memory, problem solving, and attention to detail which I know I will be unable to do in my current state.  I basically convinced everyone around me that the reason I turned it down was because I didn't want an office job but the real reason is because my memory is shot and I worry I will let my team down.

919,2021-09-12 17:41:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pn1sdh/seeking_advice_to_finally_stop/,Seeking advice to finally stop,"Hey everyone, this is my first post ever on reddit so I'm not entirely sure I'm doing it right, but nevertheless here I go. (I apologize in advance if this is a novel, I tend to write a lot).   


I'm 27 and I've been smoking ever since I was around 21. I didn't really want to start smoking weed, but I did it because everyone around me was doing it (mom, brothers, co-workers), and I wanted to fit in. Shortly after that, I met a girl who I became close friends with and our friendship was on the basis of constantly getting high. It wasn't something I really wanted to do first thing in the morning, but she was my only friend at the time and it beat being alone at home.   


It's now 6 or so years later and I've found myself in a daily habit of smoking weed and I want to stop. I've had a few attempts in the past that I was able to stop for about a week or two, but the habit always ended up coming back. Unfortunately, I come from a long line of addicts. This is one of the reasons I never wanted to start drinking or try any drugs. Luckily I do not have an issue with alcohol, I hate the way it makes me feel, but I LOVE weed. To be safe, I have never tried any other drug just in case I like them, and honestly part of me wishes I'd never tried weed (since then I wouldn't have this habit).  


Lately I've been thinking about how productive I wish I was. There is so much I want to do, and since I am my own boss, I'm the only person in my life I have to really let down, and that seems to be pretty easy for me. This is the first year in a long time that I am actually trying to change my bad habits and better myself. Weed is lower down on my list but I'm afraid it is hindering my progress in other areas. For example, I have started therapy, anti-depressants, and going to the gym. There are days where I go to the gym in the morning and I feel great, and then I get home and I smoke, and then I feel shitty for the rest of the day. Or I want to make some art or write, but by the time I sit down to do it I'm so high that I'd rather just watch a show or play a video game. Some mornings I wake up and just feel foggy and fatigued and I can't tell if it's from how much I smoked the day before, or not sleeping enough, or eating enough, or being depressed, etc.   


I've been self-medicating with weed to ""cure"" a number of my issues: insomnia, anxiety, appetite, and endometriosis pain, but what if it's just contributing to those things? I worry that my appetite is only bad because I smoke so much weed that if I'm not super high it's just really difficult for me to eat more than a few bites. But then it gets to the point where I try to stop smoking, and then I can't eat at all, and I feel so awful and fatigued and light-headed that all I want to do is smoke. I want to go on vacations but I worry about how I will be able to cope without weed. Will I be able to eat? Sleep? Will I have a panic attack?   


Today I woke up and I just felt like crap. I went to the gym and all I want to do it smoke and then lay on the couch and watch TV. But I know that won't make me happy or fulfilled, it will just make me wake up tomorrow and feel crappy for wasting the day doing nothing and getting high once again. I'm hoping that by posting here and sharing this with all of you, maybe some people can relate to me and give some advice that helped them to stop. Whenever I discuss this with my other doctors/friends, people don't really take it seriously because it's ""just weed"" and honestly all that does is make me feel justified when I do smoke. Does anyone have advice for the first day/week/month of quitting? I talked to my doctor and she said to keep it to weekends, but I'm not sure that will work for me. I feel as though I will likely have to fully stop and any support or advice is very much appreciated.",3,0

I broke up with my girlfriend of almost 5 years last week. We met at Uni, have lived abroad together and also live together currently. It was a shock to her, as well as to me. I knew I wasn’t happy in the relationship and respected her too much to just run it into the ground. She’s done a lot for me.

She was my rock when I quit smoking weed over a year and a half ago. She’d hold me in her arms as I helplessly cried myself to sleep to get over withdrawals. She always made sure I was doing okay and was there whenever I wasn’t. She even got me a card to mark my one year clean anniversary.

But right now, I’m struggling. I’m struggling to come to terms with the breakup, even though I was the one who caused it. I didn’t feel like I had any other option and I don’t regret it at all. I’m just very scared with how I’m going to cope going forward, especially with the thought in the back of my mind of smoking weed.

Not really sure what I’m looking for from this post, although if anyone has gone through or is going through something similar, please reach out.

Just putting this here for me more than anyone else. Does anyone find their environment massively influences their ability to resist smoking? Eg. I've lived with my mum most of my life (I'm 22 now), and had the same bedroom the entire time. As such, I've probably smoked 500-1000 joints sitting in the very chair I am now. Whenever I'm in this room all I want to do is smoke, but elsewhere I'm generally a lot more in control.  
  
I'm moving to Hamburg, Germany in a week's time to study and I want the new environment, new challenges and new stimuli to kickstart my journey of sobriety. I know if I smoke there I won't make the most of my time, and I definitely won't put the effort in I need to to properly integrate (most notably, I need to learn the language!).

I already feel so much better. My brain fog is better - I see lots of people deal with brain fog when they quit but I am having the opposite. I felt like I was a walking zombie even before I got high before the day. 

Last night my partner became upset with me because of how rigid I am about not smoking any weed and doesn’t understand me right now. I don’t blame them, I was a high functioning pothead for years.

I was accused of being rigid about my new view towards weed and I’m like, yup, am 100% rigid about this. Not touching it. I’ve been saying I would do XYZ for a long time and never stuck with it, I really don’t fault them for being confused as to why I am all of a sudden sticking to it. It’s also a great motivator for me to stay sober, I don’t want to be that person anymore. I miss the old me and I already feel parts of me coming back to life. 

I truly have no desire anymore. There are micro moments where I’m like dang I could just get high right now and I’m sure it would be fine. This forum helps a lot and tracking the experience and staying laser focused on why I wanted to quit has made it much easier than I ever thought it could be. My partner has continued to smoke all week and when I see the bowl and herb it doesn’t even register a blip for me. 

In one week I have improved my eating habits again considerably, I just stopped caring. I would rather get high than eat. Then once I got high it all seemed like so much effort so I just… wouldn’t. 

Weed allows for complacency and I don’t have more room for that in my life. 

On a side note, I have been enjoying my dreams so much again! I am having vivid dreams that don’t make any sense but are a blast ahaha.

I don’t know if this has to do with weed or not,

So last weekend I bought a couple of joints and have been taking a hit every night and I know I should not do it and I knew I shouldn’t have done it in the first place.

He’s been smoking since he was 15 or so and it is very much a part of his daily routine. When I met him 4 years ago, I was struggling to quit smoking and drinking. My dependence is certainly not his fault. Because if his habit, though, there is always weed (and alcohol) around.

Using weed and not using weed,"Pot was my solution to life's problems. It wasn't the best solution even when it was working, but there was a time when it worked. Eventually it stopped working and I could not even get numb. At that point, I wanted to quit every time I got high. I wanted to get high every time I quit. I was obviously stuck. I was experiencing problems as well - my health, relationship with my wife, finances. My reputation was starting to look pretty bad in my community and my ""friends"" were only people that smoked like me. I had tried to quit many times, but the discomfort of that initial detox time caused me to always turn back to ""the devil I knew."" Eventually, problems got really bad. I believed my 2nd wife was going to leave me for the same reasons as the 1st. My new career was floundering. I had been suicidal (thinking not acting) and I could see how a couple of huge events would tip me over the edge. 

**I was so desperate that I got in touch with MA - Marijuana Anonymous**

I found that (just like this discussion area) there were a lot of people that had gone through the process of quitting and were able to help me. There were resources and meetings and I started to make friends with people that embraced recovery. What I really discovered was that I have a problem with living without pot and that I need a new solution to find joy in my life and to cope with life's problems. That program provided that means of living to me and today I am coming up on 6 years of abstinence from all mind and mood altering drugs including alcohol. I am grateful that I have had a reason to look at my life and move in better directions. By the way, I'm still married. My career is going strong. My adult children respect me and we have good relationships. I don't spend time sneaking around and looking for places to get high.

I bought a $40 disposable vape yesterday. Took one hit, and kept going through this thread. The old me would’ve said, “After this vape, then quit. Don’t throw away money”. 

But reading all of your stores truly inspired me. I took that fresh brand new vape, walked outside, and chucked it as hard as I could. It shattered into a hundred pieces. (This was soooooo hard to do)

I’m still scared. Scared for the sleep, no appetitie, and facing all my demons I’ve bottles up my whole life. But goddamn, we only have one life, I’m going to live it the way I WANT to. Let’s fucking go.

When the school year was over, I took care of myself mentally and physically. I quit the weed cold turkey and began using my holiday away from the new city, on being physically active by running while taking deep breaths, body weight exercises and connecting with people. I would drink a couple of beers to loosen up from the state of mind that I was locked into from being alone for so long. 

I’m back the new uni city now and everything is a lot better, since there are no lockdowns. But I must say, I felt better when I was away from here.

I started smoking everyday 1g aprox. when i was 14 till i was 18 years old, and decided to quit when i was 18.  That first time was horrible, abstinence the first 2 weeks with no sleep, appetite and a lot of anxiety. 

After 3 months sober i started smoking again, but just some weekends with friends, didnt seem bad at all. The problem was the pandemic, here in my country we are really locked up so i started smoking again everyday because i felt lonley and could'nt be with my friends (was 20 when the pandemic started, so 2 years of controled use without it afecting my life). Just this time i knew the abstinence and all of the bad effects of weed, so i smoked 3 times a day maybe, but 0.3 to 0.5 max a day. The last month i started feeling again really anxious and overthinking a lot, so i decided to quit. First i reduced the dose for the first week (smoked 2 days in that week but just 2 hits to help the abstinence) and now im on my 8th day without weed and im feeling fucking amazing, clear headed, no anxiety, can sleep i hours without problem and having much more appetite and motivation to do everything.

 I wanted to share this with you because you guys really helped me out the first days, and also wanted to share what helped me out a lot. I am exercising 2 times a day (30 mins cardio in the morning and 30 mins lifting in the evening) and that really helped me. Also even if you dont have appetite you HAVE to eat (something i realized the first time i quit after 4 years of heavy use) it will help. And try to keep your mind distracted with something you really like (drawing, reading, etc). 

So yeah thanks a lot! I needed this change and you guys help me a lot, for you guys who are struggling, keep on going! Good things are coming (talking about my first time quitting, because i was in a really bad state of mind in that time and it really felt impossible, this second time was much easier). With that said, i still thing weed isnt bad itself (in my case), its just us who abuse it, because in a controlled enviorment (twice a month for example) it can be a really fun time with friends (i realized if i smoked alone i will fall back to the habit of smoking everyday). But i just dont want to smoke again for some months, because every time i think of it and how amazing im felling right now, it isnt worth it to smoke. Keep going guys! You can do it! Focus on the good things that are coming!

I've had a recent dabble in edibles that's ended now and I wanted to share the reasons for that. 

1. Having THC in my system puts me at risk of not just losing my license but also loosing my job and ability to work in the industry in the future. My job is dependent on a clean driving record and no criminal convictions. Weed is illegal where I live. I really enjoy my job so being slightly more relaxed isn't worth this huge potential consequence. 

2. It doesn't serve me. Weed just makes me dumb and unable to do more complex activities. I find it difficult to communicate fully and confidently with others which is something I need to be able to do. I also just compulsively eat which, as someone with a history of binge eating isn't something that serves me anymore. 

3. In the past I was a daily user. I used weed to escape my poor mental health, relationship problems and existential dread. This dabble into brownies has shown that I can't be trusted when I have access to weed, I can't control myself around it. 

In quiting I'm making what my therapist would call a 'value based decision'. I'm trying to move forward and create a life where I don't crave the escapism of mind altering substances.

Dropped that but started smoking again a few months ago and it’s time to ride that magical sobriety horse again but this time without the drink to make up for it.

Quitting the first time was one of the hardest things Ive done and I don’t even really understand why I started to smoke again after so long. But In just a few months time I was reminded of why I stopped in the first place. Everybody has their own reasons and a part of me envies those that don’t have an issue with weed. I on the other hand will smoke almost constantly and get nothing done. Make no progress in my life. Ect. It’s time to leave it behind for good now. 

If anybody else struggles with those thoughts of smoking again. Just know you aren’t missing a thing and you’ll wind up right back at that beginning of that journey you took and struggled so much through. 

If anybody wants to talk drop a comment. My methods may not work for everybody but I can share what worked for me, got me sober, and kept weed out of my mind till I ultimately played myself. And if you don’t wanna talk, I still wish you the best and know that any/every single one of y’all can live without it. No matter what your brain might tell you",6,0

And I have felt like absolute garbage today and I came to the realization. I have smoked every day to cope with a lot of deeper problems within myself. 

I don't love myself, I've ignored self care practices and coped with just smoking instead. Right? Why feel sad when you can just get high instead? 

Wrong. So so wrong. I'm coming to the realization that I've been depressed for many years, and instead of trying to work on myself and care for myself I just smoked, toked, and buried. My partner has been amazing with supporting me in this attempt at sobriety, and she wants nothing more than for me to succeed in this, but wow. 

I've felt these past couple days like I can open up a little more about my feelings, and I'm trying to just push towards that, but wow. Right around that point I could feel myself wanting to just pack a bowl and just stop talking. Shut down, disconnect. 

Instead of that, we went to get some food and just talk about why I'm such a mess 😅

For those who are quitting and have either a sober/ supportive partner in this, take a moment to give them a hug and a thank you. 

I'm slowly realizing who around me just wants to see me happy, not just high.

I have quit in the past for a few short months in between before lighting up again. Never really had any issues besides nightmares and feeling a bit ""weird"" for the first couple of days.

But now I am sweating profusely during the day, so I'm not talking about nightsweats combined with nightmares. More about walking a short distance on a decent pace or longer distance or amount of time and I'm sweating my ass off. I would just like to know if this is normal?

In the last 2 weeks I smoked only once and haven't smoked anything the last 6 days. Like I said I'm changing my life for the better and have no intention to smoke any time soon.

That being said I noticed that whenever I wasn't smoking I was drinking, when I quit drinking I smoked again. So I quit both at the same time, even though my drinking was well within acceptable levels. (Never got blackoutdrunk) I just don't want one thing to replace the other, so I quit both.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated because sweating a lot at a new job sucks like you can imagine.

Wirhout fail, I will always wake up atleast once a night for no reason. Most times I can fall back asleep, sometimes I can't. When I first quit I would wake up twice a night like clockwork, once at 1am and once at 4am.

The only time I've slept through the night is when I sleep really late (after 1am).

My question for those of you who have quit long term is will my sleep ever return to normal? Or maybe this is a symptom of me getting old? (36 yeas old). Maybe this is the karma of having so many years of good sleep thanks to mj.

But I could really use some help here,"Hello reddit, this is my first post here. I thought I might tell my story, and hopefully get some much needed questions answered.

I started smoking daily when I was 19 and I am now 25. This all started when I discovered weed in high school. I was one of those kids that presented themselves as very outgoing and friendly, but in reality had terrible insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Despite being outwardly well functioning, I was very unhappy and only getting about 4 hours of sleep a night on school nights. I pushed down what I could and didn't talk to anyone about my problems. I thought I had no real good reason to be unhappy, so I pretended I wasn't. About halfway through my senior year of high school, I discovered weed. At first it was just a fun activity to do with my friends on the weekends, but I quickly noticed how relaxed I became when I smoked, and the amazing sleep I would get on those nights. After some time, it took me a little bit to be comfortable with the idea of smoking alone, I decided to start smoking on weeknights if I couldn't sleep on my own. This quickly became a nightly ritual, because of my insomnia, it was pretty much every night that I couldn't fall asleep. By the time summer came and I turned 19, the path was paved for me to become a daily user.

When I was 20, my sophomore year of college, I realized I had smoked just about everyday for a whole year - year and a half. I was slightly appalled, and felt the need to prove to myself that I could take a break. So I did for about 6 months, and on my 21st birthday, I started smoking again. I thought to myself that because I proved that I could quit, that I wasn't dependent on it fully, I could return to using it daily because it didn't have power over me. That was the last significant break I took. 

That false realization led me to convince myself I had total control over it, so I only returned to smoking more. More often would I push my homework to Sunday and spend all Saturday high. More often would I quit studying early that night so I could smoke and worry about finishing studying in the morning. 

When I was 23 the Pandemic hit. I was without a job, on unemployment, and getting the stimulus checks. I couldn't travel anywhere and had to spend all my time indoors, but I had income. So basically I spent about 3 months straight doing nothing and being high all the time. The Pandemic started in March that year, and by June when I turned 24, I had a major wake up. I decided I really needed to get professional mental health help, and I decided I was going to start seeing a therapist. At this time I still was smoking daily, and I hadn't realized I needed to quit at this point. My wake up was that weed was my bandage, not a cure for my mental health issues and I needed help. My therapist helped me work through my trauma over the course of a year, and by the time I turned 25 I was SOOO much better mentally. However I still was smoking weed daily. Now I'm super happy with the path I decided to put myself on in life, but for some reason there was still something holding me back. I had all these new tools and a good understanding of my psychology to help me through my mental health issues, but I was still using my weed bandage instead. If I was super anxious or depressed, I would still smoke during the day, and I never stopped smoking at night. 

Fast forward a few months and now we're at the present day. I finally came to my last major wake up I need to fully take charge of my life. I need to stop leaning on this crutch that is weed, and use my new, healthy tools and practices to help me with my problems. So I decided a week ago that I was going to stop completely, I threw everything away and I'm not looking back.

TLDR: IF YOU DONT CARE ABOUT MY STORY, JUST READ THIS! I SERIOUSLY NEED SOME HELP HERE

Alright, I've been quit for a week, and my insomnia that I was treating with weed for 6 years has come back even more intensely, I toss and turn until the sun has well risen only to sleep for a few hours and wake up before noon with immediate anxiety. My anxiety disorder is running rampant and I feel my chest constricting and stomach knotting constantly for absolutely no reason at all, I'm not holding on to anything anymore I solved that in therapy, this is literally just a physical symptom from my anxiety disorder that is hard to make go away. Finally, food tastes like ash in my mouth and I have to force myself to get at least 1000 calories in me a day, and it's not an easy task. I feel incredibly weak from lack of sleep and calorie deficiency.

My question is this: when will my body finally be used to not smoking?? How long until food starts to taste normal again? When will my body want more than a couple bites of food in a sitting??

This is so frustrating because weed is definitely holding me back, but quitting it is making my body shut down. Any advice? Any help would be incredibly appreciated, I just want to know my body will go back to normal before I waste away.",11,2

Its the extreme depression that is so hard to handle. But I learned the hard way this week that no matter how much I want to go back, the massive supply chain issues all around the country will only get worse, and it has severely affected the ability to get weed anyways. 

Every single weed shop in DC is now closed down, literally almost every single one, permanently. All the local dealers can't get it in either because their suppliers are dry. And this is actually a good thing. So my point is, there is hope. Not being able to get it is scary at first but it makes it a lot easier not to relapse, forcing you to deal with this head on. I would have never gone 7 days if it was easy to access. So hang in there everyone, and realize that its not worth it to drive around for hours busting your ass to find nug, only to realize you wasted all that time and gas.

It started with me smoking at party's vining to music.
Then I began to smoke by myself to escape boredom. After half a year i began to notice that I was craving being high, and that I couldn't control myself if I had weed at home. I would just hit the bong every 3-4 hours and lay in bed while mindlessly consuming hours and hours of YouTube videos.
I began noticing the addiction probably half a year into smoking daily, but i downplayed the effects it had on me.
I tried quitting probably around 4-6 times now but i had nothing to live for and weed was my only escape out of being unemployed (first year) or being employed in a shitty job that Made me want to kill myself (second year)
I always relapsed because weed took all my ambition to follow my interests and I've become so paranoid and anxious that any social interaction felt like entering a warzone. i just smoked because it was a habit that helped me numb my feelings.
In my time on my second year i kind of began hating the feeling of being high, it didn't give me any enjoyment, instead I hated myself for falling back into the same dumb habits.
The last half a year i was using weed on and off but i finally got the courage to find a new thing to do.
I found a school where I could learn all about child pedagogy so I can become a child caretaker and I applied for it
I quit weed completely a month before school and I am now 2 weeks into my classes.
The first week was hell because i still had that anxiety and my low self esteem  pressuring me to just quit. But now that I know the other students better I feel confident they accept me the way I am.
I still struggle with communication because i lived completely isolated for the past two years tho but i think I can make it.
And I'm really sure this is the final time I quit weed because i know, weed fucks my personality , my mental health and my job if I get caught with it.

It was a hard getting to this point, but i feel even more motivated now finally taking my life into my own hands",11,0

1. I have less days where I make plans and then ditch them and do nothing because I got high.  I still do have those days though.
2. I can get to sleep fairly quickly.  I don't need any weed for that anymore.
3. Last few weeks I've had very few days where I'm sad and anxious.
4. I'm a singer and I think my singing is better and I can hold notes longer.  Before I quit, I mostly did edibles and didn't smoke from a bong very much so I don't know why that would happen but no complaints.
5. Less staying up late because I am distracted by YouTube/social media/random google searching, etc.  But it still happens.
6. Less paranoid.
7. Saving money on weed and UberEats/SkiptheDishes delivery fees because I can drive to get take-out most of the time (except when I'm too tired).
8. I'm getting a bit better at dealing with my emotions instead of smoking.  But I still replace weed with social media/TV too much if I'm feeling sad or unmotivated and I need to work on doing something more constructive instead like a walk or journaling or meditating.

However, my sleep isn't 100% back to normal.  I still have nights where I wake up in the middle of the night and interrupt my sleep, maybe 30% of the time.  And I wish I had more motivation to do things, especially the old hobbies I enjoy.  Maybe that will come in a few months.  But I also need to make time for those things.  And my memory is still bad.  It might be a bit better but I don't see a big difference.  And I still get cravings but whenever I have them, I know that smoking is a non-starter.

I had been drinking on and off for the past week, and I realized some of the feelings overlapped with when I was high. The isolation and the depression are the same and also the laziness that came along with being intoxicated. This past week with alcohol has reminded me once again how much I HATED being a stoner, how lazy and unmotivated it made me and how much I have come sober. I completely changed my life with sobriety. 

I’m writing this post because I want to reaffirm that you don’t actually miss being high. You just need headspace and relaxation and maybe a little bit of fun. You don’t need weed for that. You don’t need the demotivation and the depression afterwards.

992,2021-09-11 12:44:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pmass6/unsupportive_friends/,Unsupportive friends?,"Hey leavers! I'm struggling to deal with some unsupportive friends lately. I was living with my family in another town for the first two and a half months of my sobriety, but recently moved back in with my friend who is a heavy weed smoker and drinker. I'm at 98 days sober and trying my best to protect my sobriety despite the environment I'm in at this point. 

My dependency on weed really developed while I was living with this friend, and I think our friendship was at least partly based on the shared activity of smoking weed together or drinking. They really weren't there for me over the summer, because they were going through a lot in their personal/professional life and didn't have the time/energy to talk with me or even other friends regularly. I didn't take it personally at the time, because I understand that there was a lot going on in their life and they needed space. But as a result, they didn't see what I was going through in the early days of my sobriety and now doesn't seem to understand my sobriety in general. At this point, I'm starting to think they were just ignoring me because they were uncomfortable with my sobriety and didn't know what to say or how to act.

We moved in together around my 80 day mark and it's been a difficult transition for both of us. My roommate is struggling to adapt to our evolving friendship without me drinking or smoking. Because this friend smokes quite a bit, I've smelled weed before bed multiple times the past few weeks. It's really a trigger for me to smell weed at night and I always tell my roommate when it happens so we can find a solution and get some incense burning. I have told them multiple times that I don't have any expectation for them to quit smoking or drinking on my behalf, but I just don't want to smell it or have it in my space.

We sat down for a roommate agreement yesterday and ended up talking about this transition and my sobriety. In the course of this conversation, my friend said some really invalidating and frustrating things to me. They told me that they were confused and didn't understand why I was getting sober, that they didn't think anything I was doing or experiencing mentally before getting sober was that *bad*, and then told me that they have a very different idea of what addiction is (based off a parent's addiction). I was so caught off guard by all of this and felt extremely invalidated. I couldn't really address it in the moment because I was leaving to go home for the weekend, but I told my roommate we would sit down and have a full conversation this week. 

I've explained before how weed was making me feel in the months leading up to my decision to quit permanently. I feel like I have to defend myself and explain myself constantly to this friend, and I'm starting to feel really frustrated. They judge addiction off of quantity of the substance consumed and any visible/outward consequences of addiction. I was very high functioning while abusing weed - I did not face many consequences in my personal or professional life. I blew a several deadlines, but I was in a lenient environment and took advantage of being allowed to turn work in late. Also, I wasn't verbally expressing the anxiety and numbness I was experiencing from smoking regularly with this friend or anyone else around me. I was in deep denial over my weed consumption and hiding the mental effects from everyone around me. This friend always smoked more than me and knows people who smoke even more than them in one sitting. Because of this, they don't think I smoked enough weed to experience negative side effects. I know how I felt and I've explained how I felt, so I'm not really sure what else I can say to this friend. I feel very frustrated and unsupported, and I don't know where to go from here.

Sorry this is a novel lol I appreciate anyone who has read this far! How have you guys dealt with unsupportive friends? I don't want to lose this friendship, but I know I ultimately can't force it to continue if there's a level of disrespect and they're discrediting my choice to be sober to my face.",17,0

I’m on day 14 right now which is probably the best I’ve ever done but the biggest thing is that I feel the best about it this time. I’d like to share a few tips that got me through the first week and withdrawals, which IMO is the hardest.

- Do whatever you can to get out of your usual smoking environment. I spent the week at my Dad’s place. It may seem excessive but this is the single biggest thing that helped me. When I am physically unable to buy weed due to not having any local contacts, it stops the incessant nagging cravings running laps in my head. However, be mindful about returning and your mind then trying to rationalize “just one toke”.
- Stay busy. Grab a piece of paper and write down a list of activities you enjoy or would like to try out and do them! Though do keep in mind not to stretch yourself too thin. Your ultimate goal right now is making it through withdrawals, not becoming the most productive version of yourself (yet). If that means spending all day watching TV, so be it. 
- Drink LOTS of water. THC is stored in your fat. How does fat leave the body? Peeing and sweating. I aimed for 4-5 litres a day.
- Exercise every day and sweat your tits off. I alternated between strength training and running.
- Get out the house. Go walking, exploring, cycling, hiking, etc.
- Fasting. I pretty much starved myself the first four days so that my body burns even more fat. My appetite goes to shit in the first few days anyway so it goes hand-in-hand.
- Forgive yourself! Be proud of all the work you are putting in.

This has been my easiest time going cold turkey from an 8th per day. I struggled with eating and sleep for a few nights but compared to previous attempts this was a walk in the park. We got this!",35,0

I was just out of high school and so hopeful for the world and my future. I had self respect, even though I was also very naive. Fast forward to now, Im severely depressed, jaded, hurt and have been hurt by people, haven’t achieved any secondary education, and just over all feel disconnected from who I really am. I’ve been smoking weed regularly for 6 years, almost daily for the last 3 or 4 years. I can hardly remember anything anymore. I started a new job a couple months ago and important information goes in one and ear and out the other. My eating disorder is triggered by the munchies I get from smoking. I just come home from work and sit on the couch with TV and weed, despite my paints sitting right next to me, longing to be used. I’m like a shell person. 

I just went through a break up and this is what triggered me to finally get help. I was overwhelmed with depression after moving into my own place away from him. I went to a psychiatrist and got put on prescription medication for the depression, and since then I haven’t smoked once. It’s only been four days. I’ve taken tolerance breaks that long before but this time I’m trying to focus on how I feel instead of just looking forward to the next smoke session. It’s a lot. I have a lot of emotions that I suppress with weed. I’m reading “untamed” by Glennon Doyle and and she talks about how when you get sober, you have to learn how to “sink into” your bad feelings, instead of trying to make yourself feel “fine”. Just sink in and feel it because there’s nothing else to do. 

I don’t know if I’ll never smoke again, it makes me sad to say I won’t. I love weed and it has gotten me through some really tough things. But I have abused it and it has hurt me back. I don’t want to be this person that I am now for the rest of my life. If I keep up this habit, I will remain complacent and depressed the rest of my life. And I don’t think I have the self control to only smoke once in a while. 

I had my first dream last night in who knows how long. I’m sleeping better and waking up without disorientation. Today is Saturday which normally I would just get high in the morning and mess around all day. Honestly I look forward to just being sober and feeling whatever this vessel feels on its own. I’m waking up to the fact that life is a trip enough on its own. I want to be aware and present for the ride. 

Just thought I’d share. I’ve lurked here for a long time and everyone’s stories have been very helpful. I hope mine can be too.",19,0

So I took the plunge too stop smoking weed, ive started a new job apprentice splicing engineer, its a one in a million job and hard too come by. Ive been weed free now over a week. However I've got the mother of all chest infections. I feel awful and I'm so tempted too smoke again. 

I've got a permanent ringing in my head but think this is just the chest infection. 

If death had feelings its me right now. I'm currently curled up in bed praying for a miracle.

I don't wanna go back too weed now. Weed is awful lately round my area this is ultimately what made me stop. 

I will hopefully start see the benefits soon and feel better when this chest infection goes. I don't normally get ill and it seems to be in connection with withdrawing of weed or just a coincidence. 

In a way I'm glad that im ill as I don't wanna move and just sleep. 

Its mind over matter. You need the willpower too stop and hopefully this is the start of a new life for me!

Extra Info : I'm doing this whilst suffering from Alopecia for the last two years. It made me smoke more and its challenging when it makes you depressed. But there's no cure and I've learnt too accept it and look for the positive moments. 

So even with all my hair failing out I've managed too stop. (Depression point of view) If you're reading this and want too stop you definetley can. Lose all access too weed the best you can. Delete Numbers. Get rid of papers to roll with. Heck go for a long walk so your forced to walk back and try and get some clean air. I find night walking a nice relief too enjoy ones own company. 

Happy Quitting Guys and thanks for all the support below, its aloud me to view stopping from other peoples perspectives and give me more motivation too carry on. Also Dont think all the dreams are nightmares !

I've had a some really vivd dreams since but hilarious dreams. I.e my sisters whos able body for some reasons whizzing round on a wheelchair like a car and fell in a canal. I don't know why but hey it was hilarious to me and my mum. It was a nice moment to wake up from and left me a nice dream having not dreamt anything in about 5 years that was both hilarious and again positive encouragement on stopping. :)",14,3

Day 4: I went to go spar with one of my closest friends (Oh my god, I went outside voluntarily), and out of habit he offered me a bong rip and I declined. Fortunately, he's a close friend of mine and I told him I didn't want to smoke for a while. He respected it and didn't try to peer pressure me. So quick tip for you guys; When someone offers, say no as quick as you can so you don't have time to contemplate. ( of course, if you have people who try to pressure you it'll be a little harder but keep it up!)

ALright, so this week has been... difficult. There was definitely a lot of crying, irritability, boredom(which is normal for new quitters, because we usually are smoking for entertainment). Though, I have been going out for walks more to counter that. SLowly easing into things that I used to enjoy. Financial situation has been rocky too, not that it's directly related, but it's a hardship that triggers cravings. Cravings that are honestly on and off to date. (with them being on today.lol)

No insomnia, mainly because I've abstained in the past and I anticipated it. So I bought sleeping aids to help out. . I do find the liquids stronger but I bought generic pills instead. At least in my experience, any ol' sleeping aid will do the trick. Though, last night on the way home from work I forgot I ran out and didn't re-up. I was worried I would sleep for my shift this morning at 7am, but I had no issues!

I started to dream again! I had one of those looping dream episodes where I kept waking up inside my dream the night before. That may be irrelevant, but I didn't expect it so soon. Would say they came around day 4 or 5. No nightmares so far.

Finally, the brain fog is going away. It was heavy for a couple days, it felt like I was coming down actually for the first 3 to 4 days. It's still there, albeit on the weaker side. So I definitely feel my clarity coming back.

In conclusion, I do want to smoke bad right now, but I know if I do, it'll likely trigger a relapse into addiction again. That is something I really want to avoid right now. I would rather be proud of my prolonged abstinence, then have that temporary satisfaction that will leave me with lasting shame.

&#x200B;

After I graduated HS, I went to college for science and barely got by. I managed to get an AA, but I couldn't keep going because my grades were too poor. I have always felt that during these years, my use of cannabis was a huge factor in my ultimate failure in college.

I joined the military and did really well. I did two enlistments and was successful in advancing through the ranks and developing myself personally and socially. I married, had kids, bought a home, began taking classes to complete an engineering degree.

I left the military in March 2020 and came back to a world in disarray. I live in a medical state and I wanted to explore cannabis as a means of coping with anxiety. In truth, I think it did net harm. My anxiety, muscle tensions, and other feelings were helped with cannabis right after using. But, I think that all the while, as I used more and more the damage piled on.

In my classes, I always feel concerned with how I am being viewed, I am hesitant to take on challenges or meet new people. My grades have suffered. I am on academic probation and I have to withdraw from two courses this semester. I am really angry at myself.

I'm a high functioning person, and not just in the 420 way. I am smart, dress well, physically active. I don't think anyone knows... truly. I think people may suspect, but even when I was younger, I have always been **really** good hiding this habit.

Sharing my so far short story in hope it helps somebody in the same way reading other people's stories helped me do the first steps in past couple weeks


Background:
Its early August, middle of the work day. I am laying on the floor unable to breathe, think straight or simply compose a text to manager that I am unavailable for a while (luckily working remotely that day!). I just had a panic attack, could not ride it out, and  self-medicated with weed to numb the feelings. 

That was the beginning of month-long recurring panic attacks, insomnia, nausea and depressed state, all medicated with the same cure.  All getting worse by day, to the point of wanting to escape own body.

Inflexion point:
Honestly I do not know where I would be now if I did not reach out to a friend who succesfully put a hard stop on weed and nicotine earlier this year. Her example made me wonder if weed was actually amplyfying my troubles, not helping? 

On August 27th I spent full day searching for information about weed's negative effects, quitting tips, apps, stumbled upon r/leaves to find out I am not alone in this boat. That same day I quit with intention of never going back. 


How does it feel now? 
Two weeks is not a lot but for me some major changes started to happen.

+ I quit nicitine alongside weed!
+ sleep duration became sufficient to recharge and the dreams... Dreams are better than netflix
+ I gained 2 kilos back and after a week started exercising regularly (and actually enjoy it)
+ I stopped working remotely and came back to office. Its still hard, but the only way through is by facing a challenge
+ I enrolled to programming course to improve productivity at work and completed both weeks modules


+++ My wife cut down considerably on smoking, its just not fun for her to be stoned when im sober

+ We started to discuss our future - house, kids, timeline. Ok, sometimes its uncomfortable and leads to conflicts but it feels like we are finally moving forward in family life.

- I am easily irritated, mood swings are depleting me of energy
- lethargy. Despite excercises, i can suddenly feel tired in a middle of any activity, even conversation. I usually wake up tired and anxious
- night sweats are annoying, sleeping on towel helps
- I realized how many opportunities I lost in years of smoking. The worst are socially distancing from people who inspired me
- I am now addicted to checking days and hours since I quit. Right now its 14d 18h 27m. Thats not healthy, but motivating me somehow
- spending more time on my phone. Never had to carry a charger around before
- brain fog is a real thing. It mist have been around for a while, but now I truly see it. Please be gone from my head

My mantra nowadays:
 I feel I am getting in control of own life, finally making decisions and facing challenges, one at a time. Weed is a peculiar being, it sneaks up on you, slowly displacing other interests and becomes THE thing you do apart from eating, sleeping and working.  At the same time its not your friend or enemy, its just a plant that has the power to lift you up short term, yet it is destructive if abused. For some, cutting down might be enough, for people like myself a complete stop is the only solution.

 Its not easy to quit, so huge kudos and respect to all of you who are just starting or been on this journey for a while✊ and big thanks for such a group existing!",4,1

But it was always more like ""I made it so long and life is so grey and boring anyway, so I could as well relapse and enjoy high once again after so long abstaining"" 

Some of you may think that this is better than relapsing as a result of huge cravings, but it is not.

It is worse because it means that my issues go way deeper and it is proof that I was just using weed to fill the void which just becomes apparent when you quit...

A major amount of the detriments started to really show over the past few years where EVERYTHING started losing it's excitement; the peaks and valleys of life. I really started to feel hollow... and I finally understand what that phrase means now.

So a week ago, I found a post in this sub and that's literally all it took for me. I went through tons of stories and read a lot of posts on people leaving something I was told ""wasn't addictive"". I'd moved to other things to sort of try weening from weed. But ultimately the brain fog and the memory lapses felt like they were just as bad or worse.

I read the phrase ""play the tape all the way through"" and that's just what I did. Really looked at it all and realized that it's a temporary thing to suppress some real issues. Granted, it let me look at things from different perspectives and be ok with it. But now that I HAVE that in me, I can do that without weed.

I took my last vape cartridges and literally yanked the coils from their glass tubes; like a bee's stinger, dragging out it's entrails. It was actually kinda gross lol

Anyway, I hope this fog lifts from my mind. I hope I can be a better me and I hope that I can have the mental clarity that I hope for in time for my wedding next year.

I'm so happy I found this sub and I feel kinda awkward that I've only been clean from weed for a week. However I feel like this has already been a major shift in life and I have this sub to thank for it.",117,0

Work, school, relationships, social, single, high and low. Weed has been there in every context of my adolescent and adult life. There have been bouts where I've stopped for no more than 2 months, but I always had a crutch. I would always transition to tobacco if I quit weed. One bad habit for another. I suppose I'm fixated towards the trance like state of drawing fumes meditatively. It's been my moment of decompression and everything else imaginable. In these past 10 years I don't think I've went even 3 days without some kind of smoke inhalation. Its pretty tragic to think about, but that's been my lifestyle. Always smoking something.

27/M/4 days without any inhalation

I do a lot of activity in my day now, lots of exercise. Martial arts, yoga, swimming, hiking, calisthenics, I've made a good routine of this in the past year or so. Prior to that I was the typical get high all day, go to work, come home and repeat kind of guy. Initially I thought quitting with this kind of structured day would be much easier since before I would completely feel like, "" what the fuck am I supposed to do now"". Eventually hitting a brick wall with myself and resuming the pot.

I'm thinking, cool now I'm a bit more mature and have all these activities so its working out for me day by day. It's still challenging, but at least filling in the gaps. I felt like I could sweat it out or gas myself out as much as possible until the cravings go away. I started working out more, stretching more, just rampantly finding one thing to do after another. I overcompensated so much it started to make me feel frantic, jittery, and literally feeling my heart heavily stressed out. If anything I started to feel even worse. Today I hit a full blown panic after realizing my utter exhaustion. Who the fuck am I? I'm starting my life from scratch. That 17 year old me which picked up the habit because of all the odd issues are returning back to me. I'll do 2 hours of yoga with meditation, and still feel the anger from my adolescence. I'm still the tense, impatient, aggressive individual i was from way back when. Only now I'm regulating it frequently so I'm a lot more composed and of course the factor of maturity playing a role too. Even so I'm doing everything now with my old attributes returned to me. My cardio even got worse after quitting weed. How the fuck does that work?!

Irregardless, I don't think a whole day of deep meditation and the highest power in the world can save me. I think I have to face the fucking music after years of ignoring my problems. There is nothing I can do about it, but roll with the punches. I'm starting my life now without the weed. I have to feel every emotion, pain, ache, tension, and thought without any masking it. I have to enjoy all my activities without weed. Who am I? Who am I going to be sober?

It arbitrarily reminds me of that saying from Goodfellas, "" it was among the Italians, real grease ball shit"". An analogy for all the ex-stoners on here who are trying to get clean. It was among the ex-stoners, real grease ball shit. I'm only 4 days in and still very ignorant to whats to become of me, but this subreddit is the light at the end of the tunnel. A lot of people here are raising their vial of light in this non-fictional Cirith Ungol process of getting clean. I'm very grateful for that because I want the clarity in my life. I want to be the best version of myself and learn to lean on my own spine. I dont want crutches, I want to be a man for my family and for goodness sake. I've been running away from what it means to be a man. Its time I start somewhere.

I apologize for all the quirkiness, odd references, bad grammar and venting. If anyone here resonates a little with me please share any thoughts. I mean no harm, I just.. I needed to write something and relax. I'm trying to like being me the Mr. Rogers way. ""I like you as you are, without a doubt ( weed ) or  a suggestion ( weed ), cause I like you as you are""",16,1

Obviously this isn’t all weed and probably some mental defect but judging my life when I use to smoke with freinds on occasion to making it a habit it would be ignorant to not acknowledge how it’s made me worse.

I’ve been sober 42 days now after relapsing.  I almost made it to a year, but I slipped.

The first time making the big quit was awesome. everything was great. I got myself back into school, I was engaging in hobbies, etc. Then I relapsed for a bit, and now I’m having really intense PAWS, I guess you would say? I’m not sure, this didn’t happen the first time around. 

I’ll try to explain how I feel. I’m feeling very blah about life. I go to work, clean my house, and just sit on my phone for way too long everyday. Sometimes I stare at the wall. I just feel like I’ve lost that spark and am stagnating. I miss weed a lot. It seems like every night right before the time I go to bed, I crave really badly. 

I know I can’t go back. I’m going to be drug tested for jobs soon, I have CHS. Like cannabinoids and I just don’t mix. This relapse was a huge mistake, and while I won’t allow myself to ruminate, I am certainly dealing with the consequences. 

I try to set timers, force myself to engage in things I know make me happy, but often I just get frustrated and stare at a wall. Again, this didn’t happen the first time I quit. So I’m a little concerned… it’s just, things are no longer new to me, and I just feel bored with life. Anhedonia I guess you would say? I don’t think I’m depressed, I’m on a cocktail of medication for bipolar and generally I don’t feel depressed. I know what depression feels like, and this isn’t it.

Does this sound like PAWS to anyone? Will I eventually feel a little more motivated when I get further in my second attempt or do I need to work on myself more? Any tips to help my stagnation? I can deal with the cravings, it’s the lack of motivation that’s killing me.

To anyone who has gotten pretty far in their quit, please don’t make the same mistake I did and allow a relapse to happen when you are in full control of your cravings/life. This time staying quit sucks. Stay the course, you’re not missing anything special… best wishes everybody!",11,0

Then when i have a hot flash in my sleep i wake up drenched in sweat and super hot, so i take the covers off then get super cold without them, and the cycle continues. The better solution for me has actually been to keep the room warmer than i like, so i can sleep with a very light blanket, or without one entirely.

Reading all the stories here really opened my eyes. So many of us here are alike, and yet have lived so many different paths. Not only did it make me realize that there's no need for me to be that guy in the first place, it also helped me understand that yes, the daily smoking for 7 years, the fact that I was occasionally showing up to work high, the fact that I can say with some certainty that I've spent more waking hours on drugs than I have sober since I discovered weed, and on and on... that's an addiction right there. I'd already been thinking about how this stuff was negatively affecting my future. So many compounding, little stupid mistakes on my part because I was/wanted to get high.

So my profile: 34 year old guy, smoked weed for 13 years daily after work and all day during weekends. Got a job, finished college and got a nice bf.

I'm happy and proud I have gotten to 6 weeks almost. Grateful the urges are less intens but noticing I am sad because I am mourning this friend that I'm slowly burying by choice. Everyday I put a hand full of earth on its rotton corps lying in a hole I dug for him. A friend I know is bad for me but has given me a lot of (fake) comfort, safetey, numbing, escapism, contentness, visions etc.

I'm trying to stay busy working a lot, working out, planning activities. But lately it's been feeling fake cause I don't feel I'm able to enjoy it as genuine as I could. I guess I'm just wondering and curious how long it takes for that to happen again.

I know I've been a heavy smoker for a long time so 42 days is not a lot compared to that. But now thst the strong cravings are tempered, I feel like I'm in this limbo where I can sense reality and it's potential high, but I can't seem to have the ability to feel it yet.

It's these relaxing moments at home where I wish I could just fully enjoy a movie and enjoy my well earned and deserved free time. This feeling or lack there of makes it so temping to smoke up cuz it makes u think whats the difference? Sober life is fine but for me it ain't all that. I'm afraid I just have to sit this out for a couple more months longer then I anticipated. 

I guess serotonine really does require long term investments

I was dabbing like crazy all summer and told myself I was going to ""slow down"" once I got hired. Summer came and went and I got a job as a substitute teacher. I slowed down and wasn't really dabbing at all. I was actually trying to work out a lot more, I was taking vitamins/supplements, and just smoking when it was available to me. I told myself I would only smoke/dab when I was invited by friends/family rather than buy it, which was obviously on rare occasions.

A little over 3 weeks passed working as a sub and I finally interviewed and landed my dream job. I couldn't be happier. I got hired on a Friday and my brother came over with a gram of wax and beer on Saturday to celebrate.

After one dab and 3 beers, my body just gave out on me and I fainted. I hate drinking and almost never do it and when I woke up, my stomach was so upset. I was out for about 4 minutes and I woke up with water all over myself. (I guess I was drinking water when it happened)

I was told it was from dehydration. I was told by a friend and my cousin, who is a nurse, that taking vitamins/supplements and sweating as much as I was leading up to it and not drinking enough water was the reason why that happened.

I decided to quit right then and there but honestly, since I have fainted, I have felt like shit. I am 2 weeks into my dream job and I feel like I haven't been able to give my full effort into my job because I am constantly feeling horrible. I am feeling dizzy, nauseous, have bad anxiety, and I have headaches that don't seem to go away. I quit 8/28 and I haven't done anything since then. I felt way better by the end of that week but this last labor day weekend, I spent time with my brother and friends and all of them were smoking and I am pretty sure I got high just being around them.

I went back to feeling like crap the next day and it isnt going away.  My benefits finally started this week so I am going to make an appointment with my doctor. I feel like the withdrawal symptoms came back.

Any advice? I appreciate it. I didn't think it'd be this hard and I honestly hate myself for not quitting a lot sooner.

Delta8 had been my go-to in recent months before realizing I can't moderate and it is making life unmanageable. I don't live in a recreational state but d8 is easy to come by and works just as well as d9 for me in 25mg gummy doses. But when I use it's daily, nightly, obliviate-me just like alcohol used to be (quit drinking a few years ago with a handful of minor relapses since). 

I'm home with a cold and unable to exercise this craving away and haven't been able to move on from this idea to have my friend drop off some gummies to help me sleep through this sickness and ~then~ quit for good. But then what? Another excuse, another reason to delay quitting. 

Maybe just writing this will help. Maybe one of you has just the right phrase or resource that will help me push through. I'm just glad I opened this app before texting my friend. That's got to count for something.

Need some advice.,"Unlike many of the posts I see here, I am happy living my life with weed. I am satisfied with my diet, I am active, I like my job and can provide for my partner and I. I have a strong relationship with friends and family. I am still exploring new hobbies on a regular basis (though more time could be spent on them). I can’t think of any time when vacation, social events, etc have been set aside to smoke. That being said, I have only stopped smoking for a 2-month period (which I hated every day) in the last 10 years. Mostly, sun up to sun down. Vacations/travel have included edibles instead of flower. I easily go without it for work and social gatherings where I want to be more present. 

This month, I was recommended for a new job by a family friend. This one, however, will require a drug test. It’s a fantastic job that would double my salary and be a huge step up in my career. The work as described is something I am absolutely interested in and excited about. This situation has been extremely stressful. I hate the idea of weed being the reason I don’t advance my career but at the same time, if a drug test wasn’t required, I wouldn’t even consider quitting at the moment. (I’ve always “planned” on quitting after a few years at the job I have now to explore new job opportunities; this one happened without me actively searching)

One thing about quitting that concerns me is sleeping. Sleeping has never been an issue with weed. The two months I quit 5 years ago left me with vivid dreams that left me questioning reality. I would dream about things like sitting on the couch and talking to my roommate about something trivial. Only to follow up on the conversation and find out it never happened. This lack of awareness is terrifying to me. Yesterday was my first full day without weed and I actually slept for about 6 hours last night without much trouble. My usual is 8-9 hours with weed. I guess this is a good start. 

I guess I’m looking to see if anyone else has had this experience. I’m not looking forward to being without it because the job opportunity set aside, it has not had a significant negative impact on my life. I know that I will see improvements and my motivation will likely increase but its hard if everything seems good the way it is.",8,0

I had a blast but, I don't want to live that isolated. In my 1st year with weed, I kept it exclusively social but here I am smoking alone for the 3rd day in a row. Weed is not the end to all good things but it's definitely a catalyst for us developing bad habits and it takes us a few steps back from where we want to be. It's like a girlfriend/boyfriend when you know you're bad for each other but it's so hard to let go. I have so many fond memories with Cannabis but it's destructive.

Some of the bad side effects/ bad habits I feel have been worse bc of weed are Brain fog, low libido, women have become unattractive, MEMORY LOSS, poor communication skills, ignoring my problems and feelings, less thoughtful, less empathetic, lazy, and content. I forget who I am, my confidence has plummeted and my social anxiety is through the roof. 

Seeing the positivity on the subreddit has been quite inspiring, it actually makes me emotional when not a lot does for me anymore. I want to enjoy life sober again. It's gonna be a long road to recovery for us, but we're not gonna sleep through life.

All I can say is it’s worth it. For me smoking weed was a method of coping and not facing my pains and fears. Now after 10 months of sobriety and lots of therapy, exercise and self love I can see what weed was doing to my mind. It’s so subtle and so easy to let smoking weed become a habit. It doesn’t seem like it’s that bad. But once you are able to withstand your addictions you become so much stronger both mentally and physically. Smoke itself is actually a poison that your body has to recover from regardless if its campfire smoke, nicotine or thc. When you truly face your pains and fears then you will see how much you can grow. Your working relationships improve. Your friendships and family dynamics improve. The programming in your head changes from giving in to paranoias and noticing fears to being the happiness and love that you deserve as a human. Time becomes yours to do with as you choose. You don’t realize how many hours of consciousness are wasted being high. 
There might be some truth to it being called “devils lettuce” despite the stigma that phrase has. You can only truly experience life to its fullest when you are sober. Sobriety takes  constant and complete effort to achieve but it’s so worth it.

I stumbled upon this subreddit by accident recently and it's super cool. I've stopped smoking a few times, often with the theory that I'll be able to reduce when I return, which has never actually worked. I'm currently close to 4 weeks without weed, and I'm really enjoying it, so I'm going to keep going a day at a time and keep pushing it, but this isn't about that.   
I've started having really vivid dreams and this often seems to happen around this time, for myself, when I stop smoking. So, I was curious what other peoples experience with dreams post quitting have been.   
For myself they start becoming super vivid and intense around one month after quitting and persist for at least a few weeks. They can often be quite emotionally tumultuous, never super happy, but certainly sometimes quite disturbing.   
Last night for example I dreamt that my landlord and his wife wanted to kick me out of the flat in order to make room for someone else. This was followed by some really weird surreal stuff and then when trying to get up my own feet kept kicking me in the chest back down (yes non-sensical and recognizably so at the time, yet still happening).

It was not.

1059,2021-09-10 07:41:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pljcr3/another_shot/,Another shot,"I've been smoking heavily since around 15 years old (36F), with just a couple breaks. About 13 years ago, for a period of about a year and a half, I only smoked occasionally, and then about 3 years ago I quit for about a month. What I discovered in that month was definitely more clarity and motivation. It's almost laughable to say now, but at the time I was a little surprised to discover that all the issues I thought quitting would resolve didn't. (You know, everywhere you go, there you are).

I've been wanting to quit for quite a while again. I know it's been getting in my way of living my best and most fulfilling life. I've avoided friends and family because I was high. Avoided things I enjoy because I was high. Avoided dealing with a lot of things because I was high. 

A couple weeks ago, as our last supply was running out and my husband (40M) mentioned getting more, I said, ""maybe we should just quit"", and he said ""you want to quit?"", and I said ""yeah I think we should"". My main thing is not having it in the house - I'm not even opposed to the occasional indulgence, but if it's here, I will smoke it, even when I don't want to be high. So many times I've smoked and felt regret, and realized I actually prefer to be sober. 

We had a friend over and I was explaining this to her, and my husband asked me, ""Wait, why don't you want it in the house?"" and I explained - to which he responded ""so if you know I have it, will you want to smoke?"" - of course. Then he said, ""what if you don't know I have it?"" - and I couldn't help but roll my eyes with frustration at that (full context, we have other issues as well). Then, a couple days later, I could smell a fresh bag in the house. Now, I struggle with this a little because I don't necessarily think it's fair to expect him to follow suit, I do think smoking is morally neutral - but I guess I'm hurt that he doesn't want to support me (especially considering 5 years or so ago, when I was job searching and mentioned quitting, and at that time he was supportive and offered to quit with me), but I think the bigger picture is that maybe we just want two very different kinds of lives. I'm frustrated that he has no intrinsic desire to grow as a person. 

We've talked about having kids, and especially at our age, the potential difficulty of that - where multiple times I've mentioned it would probably be a good idea to quit before trying, and he agreed (though he agrees with anything as he doesn't really voice his own thoughts or opinions, even when asked). This is just another continuation of feeling like he has absolutely no forethought about anything, but that's probably for another thread. 

I guess my question is, is this possible for me to successfully do with my husband now hiding smoking from me? I didn't mention that I could smell it the other day - but he's been going downstairs to his work room to ""read"". I'm worried that we will continue to grow apart as I grow from quitting smoking.

About me: Early 40’s, father, spouse, solid relationships and a dream career. My first weed quit was in 2019 and I was able to string out a year of sobriety before I started convincing myself that I could get high again, but only occasionally. We all know how that works out. Fast forward 5 months and I’m eating >500mg/day after waking up early to smoke before the rest of my house wakes up.

Rewinding the clock a little further: I’m a recovering alcoholic who quit drinking and everything else in 2007. While I smoked weed occasionally in my drinking days, my real cannabis habit didn’t pick up until 2013. We had just suffered a miscarriage and euthanized our dog and felt we needed a vacation. Even in recovery, I had started selling myself on the idea of weed being a less harmful alternative to shake off all those nasty feelings. So I dove in on the beach in Jamaica, and had a dealer locked down within days of returning to the States. And thus began 6 years of morning-noon-night consumption. I decided to quit when it became clear what a shithead I’d become, constantly lying, sneaking, spending life’s biggest moments in a haze, blowing so much cash.

Withdrawal and relearning sober living was a struggle. But the benefits over time were  amazing. My anxiety abated, confidence returned, life was good. 

Why’d I relapse? A few factors, I think. First, I wasn’t really working on my sobriety. I started taking it for granted, and lost perspective for why I was sober in the first place. I started romanticizing it again. I’m also certain pandemic lockdowns and working from home for a year didn’t help. 

So here I am. I’m sweating like a hog. I threw a spatchula in a rage while cooking tonight. I feel like there’s a gorilla sitting on my chest. I have no appetite. But I know this is temporary. I am so excited to share this sobriety journey with y’all.",6,2

I've been a daily smoker for years and I'm giving it up because it's holding me back from everything I love and care about. All I do is wake up, feel that instant gratification, and then I'm right back where I started, too high to function or care about anything. I can't hold a job, and I even stopped my schoolwork because of how distracted and overwhelmed I am. Even after this I continued to smoke everyday and now I'm at the point where I just want to think straight again. I feel like a broken robot or something.

Started as something fun to pass the time, then it slowly became the only way I could eat, sleep, or feel ""normal"". Marijuana helped calm all my anxieties and made depression seem like a walk in the park. Now it's making all of that so much worse. I used it to help with bipolar mood swings and episodes and it's just exacerbating my symptoms to the extreme. I can't focus on anything, or even talk without feeling detached from everything (reality included).

I've stopped hanging out with friends and reaching out to people because I just feel so brain dead. Weed was a social lubricant and now its a draining mental sludge. I don't even know how to hangout or talk to people without smoking. I feel like that girl in the old Above The Influence advertisement. Just deflated and unmoving.

Currently feeling absolutely no motivation to do anything. Human interaction and daily tasks feel impossible. I can't even go outside or interact with people atm without feeling like my brain is burning. Feeling this way is what made me want to quit smoking weed and it's so rough rn because of withdrawal. I keep getting hit with wave after wave of debilitating anxiety. I never thought withdrawals from weed were even possible, let alone that they could be this intense. I've gone through withdrawal from other drugs before, so it's not my first walk in the park. Still, it feels like the most difficult walk.

Hopefully my motivation and creativity will come back as it leaves my system.I know things will get better but it feels impossible to be anything, even myself. Return to ""normalcy"" is whats keeping me going rn and I pray it comes soon.",3,0

You have a relationship with your family, friends, money, career, sport, nature, food, ect. It is important to analyse your relationship with all aspects of life. If something is not going well in one part of you life, it will eventually affect another one and so on. So it's very important to keep track of problems in your life and find solutions. The problem for us smokers, is that we don't live in reality. We are so far from reality that we can't analyse our life properly. Ounce we do realise a problem, it is often to late. You realise you don't give enought attention to your partner ounce she has left, you realise you need to eat better ounce you are already 30 pounds overweight... Weed has always been there for me when I was stressed. Whenever I had a problem, I would smoke instead of facing that problem. Weed makes you complacent with being less than average. Ever heard of the 'fight or flight response'? With weed it's always about flight, in my case at least. I believe we're all born fighters. This post is all over the place but I needed to write something. I will come up with a better text next time.

It was part of my identity, it was what brought me and my friends closer, it also, in a roundabout way lead to a relationship I had. I was manic for much of this, getting increasingly hypersexual, spending my money aimlessly, I neglected my studies leading to study delay... In between I would have bouts of depression, not severe enough to get me to seek help.

Then I hit the type of low where I had to seek help. I was denied the care I needed because of the weed. That night I became severely suicidal, but I also quit.

One thing that changed quickly was that I suddenly had stable period between my episodes. Even if it was only a week or two, it was such a breath of fresh air.

Because of doctors refusing me, sending me to the wrong place, Covid and whatnot, it took a year from the initial waiting list to my diagnosis.

I hate how it happened, but I am so happy to be weed free now. The money I save, and the clarity and increased stability I have gained are well worth it.

Plus, I now have an identity which reaches far beyond being a stoner girl.",93,1

It is my time! I am finally quitting for good. To better myself and my future. I may have trouble explaining some of this but I would be ridiculously relieved if someone actually relates to me here. I really want to rant out what I personally experience as I never have been able to explain to anybody. 

I started smoking about 2 years ago on and off, for me weed turns me completely zombie. It’s like I don’t exist when I start smoking, I am also an EXTREMELY irresponsible smoker, i like to think possibly because of my ADHD, I must note. When I smoke I do not just smoke a little here and there, I go on BENDERS. The past 3 weeks I have smoked over easily 25 grams of wax. This is the worst ever though, it’s not always that high. When I do quit, it’s never really a problem for me to quit, mainly because im probably ruining my life and I realize that and hold on to it. BUT, my problem is my withdrawals are the most awful thing in the world. During those “benders” I tend to really fuck my life up. Weather it be relationships, jobs etc. I actually fucked up my most cherished and loving relationship due to weed, that’s one that spins in my head CONSTANTLY! “You dumbass”, I tell myself that about 162 times a day over that one. I chose weed over someone that deserved more than the world lol. I’ve ruined and left two jobs because of weed, and lost multiple friends because of it. But funny enough I’ve never gained anything from it. It has actually just taken everything from me. ..

Every time I withdrawal from weed it’s RIDICULOUSLY intense, and I have no idea why or if it really could just be my brain chemistry being a tad different than most. I am currently on Day 3 and every single time it is the exact same type of withdrawal so I will explain my current as well as possible. 

I quite literally feel like I am in a literal like half tab trip, With the brain fog tied to my very tracer like visuals and almost “floaty” feeling, even my body feeling completely numb and gone.  I’ll be honest, this one scares the living hell out of me but I push through it. I’m a pretty lonely person, so usually going through all of this alone sucks for me but it is what it is. It’s normally just me in my head for about 6 days in hell tbh. I can recall a few times I’ve gone to my knees and just bawled from being so emotional during this shit. Although 50% of the time I’m in my head I’m probably crying lol. My emotions are so crazy. 

The sweat and the sleep. The past three nights I have slept a total of 4 1/2 hours. I sit in my bed with two fans on no lights no electronics and close my eyes, the things is, I never can actually sleep. I will sit in my bed from 10pm until 6 am unable to sleep because I am sweating so much I have a towel to wipe off with. It’s quite miserable within every aspect.. 

My appetite is still absolutely non existent. I forced myself to eat a nature bar earlier. That’s all I have eaten in 3 days. Although I am able to drink water. 

The irritability is disgusting at this point and I’m not talking to anyone because I do not want to be a dick to anyone. I do oddly find a satisfaction when I withdrawal, I always strive to be such a better person. I take more things into consideration when talking to others and really dig into what they’re saying instead of just listening and not actually caring, like my ADHD makes me do. Example: every time I withdrawal I get so close to talking to and checking up on family, it’s like my love for them comes out of nowhere and I miss them so much yet when I’m sober I could almost care less.. I do love the bit of “normalcy” I get during this period. It really pushes me to be a better person. I’m much more open and not a closed off bottle to the world. Which I notice, results in much healthier and productive conversation. The thing is, once completely sober this goes away completely…

With my ADHD, I take no meds. I haven’t since I was about 12, they also zombified me. About a year ago I started really researching my ADHD because I noticed a lot of problems in my life were generally caused by it and I just did not have a handle on it, I was never coached on what it was or what to expect so learning about it and everything else helped me get a grip and understanding on it that I definitely did not have before.  I guess my main question here is, does anyone here have ADHD and have experienced similar because of it? Any tips?",6,0

After 90 days of sobriety, in december just before I relapsed, my grandma was invited to our house. I was upstairs in my room, but I heard that they were talking about me. 

I don't know what my grandma was asking about, but my mom told her something along the lines of

""he is different now, I can feel he is now level headed and overall happier than before"" 

I almost forgot about it, but it made me quit this time. It is basically only proof of change of my behaviour, which didn't come from my burned out brain, but it came from my mom, so I guess there were some changes in my behaviour even thought I failed to see that at the time. 

It had completely opposite effect on me back then when I heard it. When I heard it, I got somehow ""cocky"" about my sobriety and I thought that I will be like this even if I relapse. Stupid, very stupid. It didn't take long before I became irritable stoner again.

How do you beat the negative thoughts?,"I've been ""quitting weed"" literally for the last 8 years. Many times I've been in a daily cycle of pot use and these holes are the hardest to get out of because I immediately start getting negative thoughts. Specifically, my mind will tell me that since I've wasted the last 10 years smoking pot, I never developed myself so I'm basically I'm an adult with no skills. This makes me more depressed since there's some truth to it because I really did the bare minimum to get my degree so now I am pretty bad at what I do for my field. I am just starting out but not anywhere near where I should/ could be. The sad part is I used to be so motivated and hard working but i really fell off. So these negative thoughts pull me back in. I tell myself ""okay you'll smoke this last time, and then from there on you'll stop"".

Eventually I get out of this daily hole and quit for a week or two. The next thing that pulls me back in is the belief that there is some benefit to pot- that if I don't smoke here and there, I'll be missing out on something. At this point I'm feeling a lot better so one little smoke doesn't seem like a big deal. Then I smoke and boom I'm back in stage 1, daily hole.

Very rarely, only a couple times, I've gone past stage 2 into the multi month quits. This is where I'm feeling invincible now and that I've officially conquered the pot addiction. I scoff at my former pot addicted self and can't imagine living that life. I walk by people smoking and feel disgust. This situation is where my surroundings are what get me. I'll be with a friend, my brother law in etc and they'll be smoking. I'll take puff thinking ""hey who cares it's just a puff"". Then before I know I'm buying a little pot thinking it's something I can do here and there. And then I'm buying it everyday again and I'm back at stage one.

Currently I'm in a stage one, stuck with the negative thoughts trapping me back into another smoke. I just cancelled plans with my gf this weekend because I'll need to make up for work I should've done during the week but I was too busy sleeping in after a night of smoking so much pot.

I feel as if my brain is working SUPER hard to complete simple tasks, like even speaking, walking, breathing, and picking up things with my hands. I just feel slow. I'm worried this could be something more serious? I know I've literally changed my brain chemistry, but I have trouble staying mentally ""present"" too and things that are usually automatic, like speaking clearly without mumbling, breathing and holding objects, are something I have to focus hard on..

Yesterday was my second week without smoking. Last time I took a hit I had a panic attack, it was an awful experience that I wish upon nobody, I thought I was dying. I’ve never considered myself a particularly anxious individual, but I’ve been struggling the past couple of months with stress both from work (1st full-time experience) and family issues (grandparents have been aging quite a lot, grandma has Alzheimer’s and I live abroad). I have had several episodes of smoking back and forth for the past 3 years, and even though I consider myself a functional addict I know weed is just my way of coping alone with what’s happening in my life. I’d do it with friends and on my own, I’d do it because it makes living on by myself somewhat bearable and also because I thought it ‘helped’ me focus and be creative with my tasks. It’s all lies. A mental fap, as we say around here. 
I’m 24 y/o now and I’ve just graduated from college, I’ve been financially independent for over 4 months now but I still feel the same as 21-years old me. And I hate that. I cannot wrap my head around the thought of being stuck so early in life, I know I needed a change and as I told myself repeatedly for the past couple of months I was just waiting for all to crumble and fall apart. I needs a slap on the face, but I didn’t know from who or what aspect of my life. Now I know ain’t nobody gonna do it for me. Growing up sucks and life just won’t get easier, I feel like I’m inside a dark pit and I fucking hate myself for putting myself in this position. It crashes so bad with this image of false perfection I’ve put up ever since I was a little child. 
I’ve gotten back to therapy, I’ve reached out to my boss on how to handle myself better at work, and also to friends and family for advice and feeling some distant company(?). 
I know life doesn’t suck and that it doesn’t have to be like that, I know I can pull myself out of this. But man it’s hard. Just gotta keep on going, one day at a time.",11,0

I remember looking at this sub and seeing people celebrate 100 days, thinking that was so far away. But here I am, 250 days and not once did I take a hit since then.

The first 60 days were difficult. I had a lot of trouble sleeping, and my body was sweating a lot. But after those 60 days it was easier for a while. The last few weeks I noticed my brain is trying to trick me into smoking weed and cigarettes again. Telling me that I have proven myself and that 1 won't hurt. But I know that one is all it takes.

My biggest help has been the counter on the homescreen of my phone. Every time I look at my phone I see how many days it was since the last time. And if I take a single hit I will have to reset it to 0.
I remember how slow those first days passed. Feeling like I didn't smoke weed for weeks while it was only 2 days. That counter is keeping me in check. I do not want to start over, no matter how much excuses my brain can come up with.

7 All my friends still smoke weed and tabaco every day and all day. I can smell things they can't smell. I can smell who was in the room before me, I can smell who is around the corner. I was the only one noticing a gas leak in a room full of people smoking.

Other benefits are that I never have to catch my breath anymore. Never. I run to catch a bus and be okay. I couldn't do that. I have smoked weed for 17 years, every day and all day. I didn't run ever because I wouldn't have enough air to do that. Now I can. I'm very amazed at how much my lungs have recovered, I didn't even realise I was living on so little air. But every activity in my life has become easier. Same for riding a bike. I always thought I was slow because I do not like to sweat, turns out that I can go pretty fast now that my lungs can actually get oxygen. 

My dreams are very vivid and I remember multiple dreams every night. I get compliments about how good my skin looks every time I meet up with someone. And now that I have a functioning nose I realise that I must have smelled so bad for 17 years. So I smell nicer now. 

The weirdest thing, I used to smoke joints to help me with anxiety and not feeling good in general. But I don't have anxiety anymore and I feel good pretty much all the time! And even my menstruation has gotten less painful (after the first 3 horrible months). I sleep way better and wake up more rested than I ever did while still using. It seems that all I wanted to remedy was actually made worse by weed. 

All in all it is totally worth it. And I'm not planning in going back.",13,0

I've been sober for a whole year, and I cannot even remember how good it felt. No doubt that it is stopping me from becoming my best self, and this is why I cannot wait to get out of this place, have my own weed-free, smoke-free home and take up CBT treatment as well - as my recent contemplations have concluded that I'm running away from deep feelings of neglect, and self insufficiency.   
I just have to vent really, I'm turning on affirmations everyday to help myself believe in myself and quit for good, but if I have to be completely honest, I'm not feeling it yet. Its like your own self- belief in yourself has diminished to a bare minimum and you cannot trust any of your actions at all..  


I think that, thats the biggest pain, the inability to have integrity - to stand behind our words and actions, and when we do finally achieve it through quitting addictions and bad habits, it is so powerful and fills you with pride and happiness - that, I do remember from my one year off.

Here’s why i chose to give it up.,"I began drinking at 13 and began smoking weed at 19 as a substitute for drinking. Toward the end of undergrad college, i started smoking daily, but my smoking was limited to evenings after i finished studying. Graduate school was by far the most stressful time of my life. I was extremely anxious due to the requirements placed upon me as a grad student. Eventually, i got to the point where i began viewing weed as my daily reward for completing all the work i had to do for the day. It was during this time where i believe weed went from being a habit to being an addiction. 

After finishing grad school, i got a job in software development and have been doing that for the last 15 months or so. I work 100% remote and no one at the company i work for ever turns their cameras on. So up until about 50 days ago, I’ve been able to smoke weed every 2-3 hours, 7 days a week with nothing preventing me doing so. I only stopped after i recognized it as an addiction. 

I finally decided to stop when i noticed i was having chronic bladder infections, shortness of breath, irritable when i didn’t have weed, i was always plotting on how i could get more weed, i wasn’t getting high anymore, my sinuses were always congested, my balls were hurting (not kidding. My balls literally felt like someone kicked me in them. Went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and everything. They never found out why. It only stopped when i stopped smoking), i was super confused when sober and I’d have nightmares whenever i went to sleep sober.

Had gone completely sober for about 4 weeks but at social events I’ve hit the blunt once or twice. The feeling isn’t the same and I don’t crave it at all anymore. Haven’t bought in 2 months and I feel like I kicked the habit and would only do it if I feel like partaking socially but most times I’ll still say no. I feel free or whatever which seemed impossible in the beginning.
However, I’ve started to do something else and I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience here…
I heavily associated smoking with driving and my commutes are pretty long so it was a way to pass the time, of course I don’t have that now so I’ve subconsciously started to use food instead. I find myself picking up fast food or some kind of snack almost every other day. I’ve actually gained weight since I stopped smoking weed which is highly ironic lol. 
It kinda sucks and after some research I’ve found out ppl with addictive tendencies that veer into drugs also tend to have unhealthy relationships with food, albeit suppress their hunger or over indulge.
Anyone go through this? Any advice would be so appreciated

Prior to meeting my now husband, I had never tried weed. But he was a heavy user and some of my new friends (new city) smoked quite a bit so I kind of decided to try it. 

At first it was just a weekly thing. Then a daily thing. Then a multiple times a day thing. 

I stopped smoking for about a year when we were trying to conceive and while I was pregnant. 

But since having our child, moving to a new place away from friends and being out of work, I picked it up again. Daily.

I enjoy smoking, I feel less anxious and it dulls a lot of the chronic pain I have. However I realised a while back that inhaling smoke wasn't a great habit for me or for my health. Plus being high around my kid isn't the best, obviously. 

Anyway, I've been looking for paid work the last few months. 

Well I finally found something and got an offer... but now they want to do a drug and alcohol screening. I'm obviously going to test positive for THC and it just really upset me. I got really mad at myself for getting to this point where I am smoking daily and potentially going to lose out on income for my family because I buried my head about having a problem with weed.

I got a lucky break in that where I live we are in Covid lockdown, so the lab that does the drug testing has advised they are not doing them at the moment. Which buys me time to detox. 

My last cone was two days ago. So far it's not been terrible, the only thing is that I have to put up with the chronic pain as the meds prescribed to me don't really work (hence why I was smoking in the first place). My husband has stashed the weed away so I am not tempted and I am hoping that by the time things open back up, in mid-October it seems, I'll have the THC out of my system for the test. 

Anyway, I just wanted to post here and see if anyone can offer support, advice or anything else. If you're a reluctant quitter like me, let me know what keeps you going.

I started at 14 and constant use began at around 16-17 ( I was the kid who cracked open my bedroom window at night and smoked one hitters to fall asleep). I am 27 now, my habit graduated into taking around 10 dabs a day for the last 6-7 years, at the point where I wake up in the middle of my sleep and dab to fall back asleep then dab when I wake up, etc.

It's hard to see that weed is weighing you down when you look around and see you've done pretty good for yourself, a wife, a house, nice cars, a son, a good paying job, but there's a voice in the back of my head telling me Im not living up to my full potential.

I've lost track on how many times I've tried to quit, I've been able to do it on and off but nothing longer than 3months to get clean for a job. My wife is very supportive but also participates, and my friends and family are the same way. They have heard it so many times from me it's turned into the boy who cried wolf, it's almost like I want to tell other people so they can hold me accountable but I'm such a weak minded person I fail after the first 3 days because the lack of sleep kills me. 

After I get off work is my biggest trigger. I live a healthy active lifestyle, and I love to workout. The problem with daily dabbing is you can still dab and go be active which is why I fell in love with, but after I get off my shift and come home, I literally need a dab to relax and wind down.

I've just lost my place at uni due to being inactive, have cut off virtually all my social ties (at first I only started hanging out with other users/ex-friends and ""having fun"" but that got boring quickly enough) and I'm back to square one - no proper friends, no school/job, no future to look forward to but the next shipment. 

I'm 22. I've been smoking since 14, started very occasionally but at 16 it was wild, then I ""woke up"" and started my path towards sobriety. 

I've been on and off these god damn benders for 7 years now - 1-3 months of sobriety and all seems fine, then a relapse and a similar session of daily use, darkness and isolation from the true self. After 7 years, I've finally lost hope that I can truly beat this thing...

A little background.. I smoked pretty regularly my junior and senior year of highschool. After graduating I got caught up in harder substances for about 5-6 years and had zero desire for anything weed related. A year after kicking the hard shit I began smoking weed (stupid, i know). I work long days and it's nice to come home, hit the bong, and cook/clean. But i've noticed it's made me lazy and unmotivated. Can I also mention the weight i've gained from the munchies.. SMH. 

I've worked REALLY hard to turn my life around and make it into something I never thought imaginable. I love what I've done for myself without hard substance and know I can continue the momentum if I put down the weed too.

Last Monday I tossed down a storm drain a super nice medical 8th....I'm not going to lie I had anxiety over it for a couple of nights, knowing that when I got off work and the family was in bed that I didn't have my crutch. Luckily for me my son and work are exhausting and I don't need weed to sleep anymore and found myself passing out by 10pm each night, though with some tension residing occasionally. 

So far no more munchies, no strong cravings (though once in a while the thought pops up) and I've been running 2-2.5 miles about 3-5x a week now. I'd say the coolest thing so far is my dreams came back on Night 2. I also no longer have anxiety about looking stoned or dragged out when at work. That would get me. I no longer plan my schedule around my smoking sessions. I'm still battling other vices and I'd say I'm winning though it's ongoing. To those who want to quit, maybe just throw the shit out. It felt liberating and empowering to me.  I know myself well enough and have been down this path before to know that if I ""smoked it all then quit"" that I would just suffer during that time and would justify it somehow being okay to get ""just a little more"".

In 2011 was when I first was introduced to cannabis, I recall working for my uncle, tending his private beach development on a small lake in Midwest Michigan. One hot summer day, I was accompanied by my uncles nephew who was an avid cannabis smoker and also an employee at the time. I overheard rumors in our family about how my uncles nephew was a huge stoner and my family disapproved but either way something about the plant attracted me. Somehow that day I managed to convince this 24 year old man to let me, a 13 year old boy take a hit of his one hitter. I felt dizzy but not stoned, none the less I wanted to experience more of this plant. So over the years I began to smoke more and more on and off due to my moms disapproval of cannabis. Fast forward to 2016, my 18th year in life and I am off to college, I thought to myself ""Freedom from my mothers disapproval of cannabis"". I remember college is when I really began smoking heavily - just about every single day - and when I ran out I would just crave the experience of getting stoned. I would buy wax and bud throughout my years in college and my only hobby was smoking MJ. During, sophomore year is when I took a year and a half off to straighten things out as I failed several classes and knew I had to buckle down. During that time I began to do really good in life; I was completing course work and taking up an internship at a large real estate company alongside finding meaning and purpose in my life, etc.

Things were good, I finished most of my schooling, I got my real estate license and started building my real estate business.

After the 6th month of the Pandemic there was all the sudden a sudden urge to smoke again I was craving that higher state of consciousness that MJ thrust me into. So I started smoking again from 2020 till August 31st of 2021. While going through this phase of smoking, I noticed that my consumption actually surpassed the amount I was smoking in college, then I noticed that my performance started going down, I was loosing my self control, smoking became very impulsive and it was the only thing I sought to do. I was brought to a low state where I would lie to get out of certain events just to be on my own to smoke, getting stoned trumped all other activities. I did not like this one bit, I was stoned every day till August. I looked back and reflected; The thought came to mind, "" This is exhausting, I am no longer getting the magical stoning effect, I Just feel normal at this point"" It was a sign that it probably should be given up if I had to smoke to feel normal or happy.

There are many more observations that I've listed below that has ultimately brought me to letting go of Cannabis.

Observations-

1. The time I spent smoking was really a time of becoming mindless not focusing on my goals in life and therefore becoming distracted through out the years.
2. Overtime the experience became the same; in order to get to a very high state it took much more plant matter to consume to get really stoned.
3. Sober me is angry, irritable, depressed until getting a few hits in.
4. My memory is shot now, I can't remember what has happened on certain days of the week, it's almost like days blend into each other, or I won't realize how much time has passed. The only time I can have a good memory is when I am stoned - (State dependent learning / Memory) .
5. When I am stoned things are beautiful, I am awake and energetic, my verbal fluidity and ability to explain and contextualize things comes very easy, however when I am sober I feel tired and depressed, I have a harder time explaining things. I feel as if I was stoned so much that I learned to function that way.
6. Smoking for me became a vicious cycle; I feel down the morning after , so I smoke to feel better, thus truly not getting better.
7. I want to live a life sober, where naturally I am happy and have no need to smoke.
8. I fall short when I am high, I don't perform as well, I am not the man I could be, to my fiancé, clients, etc.
9. It's expensive, I've spent probably over $5,000 on smoking equipment and Cannabis during the years of smoking.
10. Smoking became my top priority in life, everyday I looked forward to getting stoned.
11. I have a strong desire to live a life free of intoxication.

Don't get me wrong Cannabis is good for some but for me personally I don't want to experience this same feeling over and over for another 10 or 30 years. I am 23 now, looking to live a more fulfilling life without MJ. There is no use for it in my life anymore.

The process of getting better is slow and somewhat bleak but as each day goes by without MJ I am feeling better. In fact recently, I am starting to feel extreme gratitude towards all of life to the point where I am in tears. I haven't felt this good in so long; a feeling of bliss comes on and it brings about a state of mind that is contextualized as unconditional compassion and love towards all life. I would like to help alleviate human suffering in any way I can, and to have that present in my life is truly a blessing. I look forward to continue walking forward and living a more fulfilling life!

Things are going well. I'm accepted the fact that I have a precarious relationship with weed (and alcohol) and that intoxicants have no place in my life if I want to remain sober. I've made it a priority to stay sober, like my life depends on it because if quality of life is a factor then it does.

I basically lazed around the last two days not accomplishing much of anything and doing things (excessive netflix, etc) that are escapist type of behavior. I've got a lot to do and a lot to accomplish and now those two days are gone never to be relived and by my own standards I've wasted them. 

Part of recovery for me is analysis of my behavior and trying to find out the whys. Life is hard, doing things and achieving accomplishments is hard. It takes effort and energy and its not always fun and immediately rewarding. All those years of being a stoner and being stoned made it easy to just unplug, turn off and ignore my responsibilities.

Being lazy and not accomplishing anything makes me feel guilty and semi-depressed and it gets worse the longer I do it. 

I need to remind myself to stop viewing challenges in their entirety. It can be overwhelming when the challenges you face are great. All changes are a series of small steps. Sometimes those steps are steps backwards but you can't let it break your forward momentum. Getting out of the slump of being lazy many times is broken by taking just one small step towards your goal. Even if you don't want to. It's hard to force yourself to do things sometimes.

For me I need to learn to take those small steps even when I don't want to and would rather just stare at a 6"" screen binge watching something that has no value other than distraction and entertainment.

In an earlier post I mentioned that part of recovery for me was to identify negative or weak behaviors and character flaws and work to fix them. I'll admit this has been one of the toughest ones and one that often leads to negative feelings about myself and a low mood. I feel so much better when I am at least trying to be productive in all areas of my life. It takes effort and energy and sometimes I don't feel I have it but most often if I *actually try* then its never as bad as the thought of getting on my feet and doing something. 

According to my phone in the last 48 hours I've had 31 hours of screen time - its from binge watching stuff. That is insanity. It's another addiction.",6,0

I had many off periods that were several years in a row, to provide context. When I was younger, weed was my choice for fun instead of alcohol. Several traumas later and a severe case of PTSD led me to try weed when I had gone rounds with various doctors and prescription  pills that made me feel so much worse. 

Weed worked really well for me, and it was the late aughts when we began having legalized medical marijuana clinics in abundance in Southern California. I learned about the strains and started to cope with the flashbacks, anxiety, and even night sweats. I continued therapy for years and did EMDR with weed. 

About two years ago I realized that I didn’t really need weed anymore for the PTSD. It was a strong mental need and I was using weed to numb myself to my life. And finally, I was ready to face it sober. Then - the pandemic. And my nightly joints became daytime and morning sessions again to cope. I felt like I was in the early stages of my PTSD all over again because of how anxious my brain was and my body was tense. It was so easy to consume from home. 

I don’t know what flipped but I’ve finally accepted that I don’t need it anymore and I don’t want it, not like I did. I used to enjoy sitting with my partner and sharing a joint and talking about our day and I simply cannot do it anymore. 

So why am I posting? For years I have had severe night sweats and nightmares and that’s what kept me smoking. One of my major traumas happened while I was asleep and for close to 15 years I have felt fear every.single.night at bedtime. The brain is seriously reptilian, I can feel it turn on to HIGH ALERT when I am dozing off. I will jerk awake and be in a fight or flight state for the next 20min to 2 hours.

I guess I’m on Day 2, and I’ve had hot flashes all day. But I also had them the last few weeks while I was still consuming every evening. I naturally started to seriously slow down my usage about two months ago and have not missed it, at all. In fact, I’ve started to resent “needing” weed for a good nights sleep or to help cope with flashbacks, it was my final cord to cut. 

Add to that, I can’t tell if my hot flashes and sweats are now menopausal of origin or PTSD hangover. I would really love to hear from others that have used weed for PTSD symptom management and their experience with quitting. Bonus points if you’re an “old” crank like me.

Week 3, day 15-21: STILL dealing with insomnia, anxiety and depression were at an all time high (took to self harming and ended up at psych ward for a day),  still exercising daily and feeling pretty confident with myself, mood swings were still there but not as bad, still dealt with brain fog, experienced a little bit of DPDR but not that bad, still drinking lots of water and eating as healthy as possible, didn’t read much this week my mind couldn’t focus whenever I tried 

Week 4, days 22-now (I know it’s longer than a week but you get the point): Was prescribed new medication after trip to psych ward, insomnia is not as bad now, experienced night sweats for a couple days but haven’t had them in a while, anxiety and depression aren’t as bad as they were before, still working out daily and really starting to feel confident with my body, started meditating daily, still drinking lots of water and eating healthy, getting back into daily reading

Today, just like some kind of celebration, i thought about it. I did not do it but now that my focus for my next days will only be working and making these online projects to launch, i feel i might be vulnerable to my desire to smoke some joints.

Alchol is not as ""celebrating"" as weed.
Today i didn't do it but what about when i get my degree at the end of the year? Or what about my brithday?

I have to think reasons not to do it in this kind of situations of me ""relaxing after good work"". Also because my mind would tell me ""well...it is just for celebration""...
Do you feel i am doing right by taking away also this kind of ""category"" of smoking-time?, even if it would be once in few months at max?

After researching the topic for quite some time I think 24/7 cannabis consumption isn't really helping the situation as when I run out I turn into the incredible hulk. I always put this down to withdrawal but having stopped smoking for 4/5 months the emptiness feeling would not go away. Turns out 30% of cannabis consumers could possibly be self medicating for their symptoms of BPD .

I've never really quit before other than a 3 week break not long after I first started smoking. Other than that, I've had a few times where I've gone maybe 3 or 4 days at most but that's been a while. I actually can't remember the last time I even went 24 hours.

I'm at a weird point now because in a way, I don't really have a reason to quit. I made it through college and landed a great job and have been making a decent little life for myself and weed hasn't hindered that, but I also feel like it did end up swaying me from my true dreams and aspirations at some point as I'm not in the career I had envisioned for myself in the years leading up to college and I'm worried my brain has become ""mush"" as I just don't feel as smart as I used to.

I'm on my first day of ""quitting"" and I'm feeling the same way I always do when I get here. I have a hard time staying focused on ""important"" things like my work/job and as soon as I'm free of those responsibilities I feel an urge to try to sleep just to pass time. It's like anything I would've done after work normally would've involved me smoking first but since I'm not allowing myself to have it, it's like I have no interest in doing any of the things I normally would. So I just feel like sleeping the day away until I make it until 1 day without weed, then 2 and so on.

Is this bad? Or normal? It just makes me feel kinda bad about myself because it's almost like me saying ""Well if I can't be high I'd just rather not be awake"" which is a sad thought to process. Am I being too hard on myself? Or am I too deep into my problem to see how much of a problem it really is?",59,0

I think the more comfortable I got with him the more I thought ""ok, he doesn't care if I smoke, so I can do this and be myself"" and I slowly started doing it from every so often to nearly every day or so.

Both times I have been here, got involved, made proclamations that I was soon folding on.  It becomes a bit embarrassing to come back after failure, but I know I'm far from the first to do this.

Nonetheless, here I am.  COVID has really allowed me to become more of a recluse and really soak in my addiction.  I am at home 99% of the time now.

But when I fell into a deep depression in my junior year of high school, I began having a difficult time falling asleep—mainly because I didn’t want to wake up—and weed was the only drug that consistently knocked me out. Luckily my parents supported me, because they figured it was better than prescription medications (which I also ended up on). My therapeutic use eventually turned into recreational use, however, and before long, I was smoking weed every single day—and multiple times a day at that.

By my senior year of high school, I had gotten used to getting ridiculously blazed every night, raiding the pantry and eating whatever I could get my hands on (it got to the point where my mom had to visit the grocery store more often because of my binging). I would go to bed with a severe stomachache, usually feeling nauseous, sweating like a pig. In the morning I’d wake up and shit my brains out from having consumed so much junk the night before. I’d also still be high, which wouldn’t have been an issue if I weren’t responsible for driving myself and my then (and current) girlfriend—who I eventually got hooked on weed—to school everyday.

I would drive to school “highover,” and usually spent two or three hours in class partially blazed until I sobered up. This pattern continued throughout the rest of junior and senior year, to the point where I missed so many days of school to go home and get high—I would literally drop my girlfriend off at school and then leave—I almost didn’t graduate. I had easily gained a solid twenty pounds, lost most of my muscle mass from years of lifting weights and martial arts, and was in a constant brain fog that made me feel like an idiot.

Through the grace of god and the fact that I had done relatively well in my sophomore year and hung on by the skin of my teeth in junior year, I—along with my girlfriend, who managed her weed smoking much more successfully than me—managed to get into a good four-year university. But my weed addiction—I would consider it an addiction by that point—only continued in college, where I continued to gain weight, dull my mental capacities, and suffer from stomach pain on a daily basis from the previous night’s binging.

My freshman year of college was certainly my worst, as I was majoring in a subject I absolutely despised; I even considered dropping out before deciding to switch majors at the end of the year. While I used copious amounts of weed to handle the stress and anxiety I was experiencing, I managed to balance my weed use and perform well academically over the next three years. Nevertheless I knew that weed would always limit my mental and physical potential (and disqualify me from any job that required a drug test). Several months into my senior year, COVID hit, and my plans to apply to graduate school were scuttled, so I took a quarter and a half off to gather my bearings and figure out what I wanted to do.

While weed played a central role in getting me through that time period—I literally sat around and smoked weed and ate copious amounts of junk and fast food—it also forced me to realize that it was limiting my career options. I had discovered over a period of several months sitting inside my apartment all day that I wanted to do something that involved actual people, something with my hands, something in the material world. Staying inside and reading and writing papers that no one save a small circle of academics would read suddenly felt utterly meaningless.

So I decided that I wanted to become an emergency medical technician, or EMT. There was an obvious problem, however: I was going to have to quit smoking weed. I rolled it over in my mind, and after numerous discussions with my therapist, my girlfriend, and my family, I decided that I wanted to be an EMT more than I wanted to keep smoking weed. I returned to college in the spring, planning on graduating at the end of the quarter and getting my certification over the summer.

During the first month of spring quarter I constantly reminded myself of how badly I wanted to become an EMT, and that ultimately motivated me to stop smoking weed; for the first time in six years, I finally felt like I didn’t need to smoke to be happy. The fact that my girlfriend still smoked made quitting more difficult, but she was conscientious of my decision to quit and tried to smoke away from me or when I wasn’t around.

Unfortunately, my break didn’t last very long: After I had quit weed for a month, I found out that although I had completed all of the classes required for my major, I hadn’t fulfilled my total unit requirement. In other words, I had two more quarters of college left. This pushed my EMT course to the following spring, and subsequently pushed me back into my weed addiction. Because I now had a year before my EMT course, I thought, finishing up the rest of school would be a lot easier if I could smoke weed to cope with my stress. I figured I would just stop smoking four or five months before my class started next spring so I could get clean.

So I started smoking like a fiend again, and quickly returned to square one. I began eating fast food, ordering donuts and Pop-Tarts from 7-11 at 1 am, and feeling too lazy to brush my teeth or wash my face before bed. Thus continued months of nightly binging, nausea, and morning regret. I looked physically disgusting. I was ashamed of myself. I didn’t want to go outside because I was so self-conscious. I felt like I didn’t have anything to be proud of—I felt fat, lazy, unproductive. I felt like I had nothing to be proud of, a sack of nothing.

My girlfriend tried to assure me that she loved the way that I looked, that I was still handsome and that my weed smoking didn’t matter, but it felt more like she was enabling me. It certainly didn’t help that she had also fallen down a similar path to me—yet always managed to control her eating habits—with the exception that she had already dropped out of school and found a secure, well-paying job that still allowed her to smoke weed.

I seriously reconsidered my weed addiction in late May of this year. After seeing recent pictures of myself hanging out with my mom one weekend, I realized I was the heaviest I’d ever been, and I couldn’t stop comparing pictures of that weekend from when I was in shape in high school. So I decided that I had to fix my eating habits (but not that I had to quit weed). For about three months, it actually worked. I started counting calories and made a conscious effort to watch what I ate. I was miraculously able to maintain a consistent caloric deficit throughout the week, despite continuing to smoke weed and binge on the weekends.

Over the past month, though, my weed addiction has taken a turn. Halfway through August—about two months since I started dieting—I had shed about twenty pounds and decided that I wanted to start lifting again. The thing about lifting weights is, your metabolism becomes elevated for longer than when you do cardio, and you naturally become more hungry. Thus this past month has been the hardest in terms of managing my binging; I’ve started binging earlier in the week—Thursday instead of Friday—and end later, continuing through Monday instead of Sunday. I’ve had a much more difficult time managing my portion control, counting calories, and not letting myself go when eating while high. Last night I binged the most I have in weeks—if not months—devouring pizza, garlic knots, pancakes covered in Nutella, M&M cookies. I felt like absolute physical and mental shit when I went to bed last night, plopping myself in without even brushing my teeth.

So today, during my morning walk, I reflected again on whether the fleeting euphoria of binging junk food was worth the lasting regret I inevitably felt upon waking up. I’ve decided that it’s not. Instead of quitting weed in several months—it was probably going to be around November or December—I plan on stopping now. I’ve been making gains in my lifts, have lost a significant amount of weight, and for the first time finally feel good about myself both mentally and physically. If anything, lifting has provided consistency in my life, something I’ve desperately yearned for over the course of college and the pandemic.

I’m tired of feeling regret. I’m tired of having low self-esteem. I’m tired of the progress I make being overtaken by the shame I feel whenever I get high and binge. It’s just not worth it anymore.",25,2

Sorry for spelling mistakes, English is my second language. 

The last 2 years have been a rough ride; back then, the girl that I had shared my life with for the previous 5 years, ended our relationship. It was hard. I tried to get her back, but only caused myself more pain. I didn’t allow myself to heal and move on. I feared loneliness. 

After a couple months of that, unable to endure being alone with myself, I rebounded and found myself in the most toxic relationship I have ever been into. This new girl would give me all the attention that I wanted, but only when she felt like it. When she got bored of me, she would dump me, only to text me a few weeks later to take me back. Having no self esteem, and believing I couldn’t find anyone better, I would take her back every time. I was a toy. She was also the jealous type and she would check my text messages without me knowing and would question me when I talked to other girls (they were only friends). Everything felt like it was always my fault. In retrospect, she probably was scared of being alone as well. I guess I was also using her since I wasn’t over my ex, so we probably deserved each other. We were 2 assholes causing each other pain. 

I felt like such a piece of shit so often during that time period. I started having conflicts at work, and started smoking progressively more to ease the pain. Up until that point in my life, weed had always been an occasional drug, only smoking for fun times, not so much as a tool to cope with hard times. Things kept spiralling downward until I hit rock bottom; this girl rejected me one last time and I had a breakdown at work; I couldn’t go on like this anymore. I was depressed. I stopped working for a while and went into therapy.

Therapy did help, although I was continuing to smoke more and more. I made some progress, realized some stuff about myself. I felt like I was on a good path, I was finally starting to heal and when the shitty feelings would come up, I would just smoke it away. I gained confidence, and after 3 months I went back to work. A few weeks later, I met this girl and we hit it off. She was amazing in so many ways. She was beautiful, smart and full of joy. Things were finally looking up. I was seeing her almost daily pretty fast, and realized that while I was with her I didn’t feel the urge to smoke. I was falling for her and I guess the feeling of being in love broke my habit, since I wasn’t feeling lonely and shit anymore. 

I’m now realizing I set myself up for failure: I was dependent on her to be happy.

We spent 10 months together. Without me noticing, I slowly changed my priorities so they would focus around HER priorities. After a while, I began smoking again, but only during the evenings she wasn’t there. I wouldn’t tell her either; I was ashamed. I guess it changed the dynamic, since instead of growing together, she grew away from me. After a month of being progressively more and more distant, she broke up with me, saying she didn’t feel in love. She said everything was great with me, but she just didn’t have THAT feeling. 

It’s been a few weeks. I’m taking it pretty bad. I've been smoking daily up until yesterday. I feel empty, so sad and so lonely. I had something good going (or so I thought), I saw a future with her, so being dumped was a big slap in the face. I’m scared shitless. Scared of being alone with myself and my thoughts. I’m realizing I’ve always been afraid of loneliness and have been coping with it in all the wrong ways. I smoke to numb the pain, to avoid my fears.

I figured I wasn’t quite ready for a relationship. I wasn’t done healing when I met her. I’m trying to face my inner demon, but it’s hard. Being alone is hard. I don’t regret meeting her, she helped me grow in many ways, being into self-improvement. But I regret not facing my fears before now, feels like I blew it with this amazing person. 

I managed to avoid smoking yesterday, feeling super anxious and shit. All I want to do is smoke for a bit of relief. I know I have to push through if I want to get better, I'm done for good, so here we go!

You were functional, you had a job, romantic relationships, family. You remained sightly unhappy, unsatisfied anytime you were sober and smoked to fill in the gaps in your life- you couldn't afford a super nice place to live, or special holidays, new clothes, or many treats- mostly just rent, bills, groceries, weed and takeaways. No big treats. Weed made every day have a little treat in it. But despite treating yourself every day to your favourite thing- weed- you were unhappy. Didn't enjoy your job, the only highlight was the joint on the way home. Plus you had to smoke in the morning to get your self there. Your relationship made you happy, but when you had an argument, the easiest thing to do was to have a joint and let the issue mellow.

After a few years you found yourself with an unsatisfactory life that didn't meet your needs anymore. A life that required weed as the fuel to make it through each day. To remove the weed would make life miserable so why bother? On the other hand, to change the life circumstances seemed IMPOSSIBLE. So you trucked along on the very slow downward spiral until you hit rock bottom. For me, this was an emotionally draining, unhealthy relationship, moving back in with my parents after the break up, 7 years worth of jobs I hated, heavily overweight.

8 months ago I quit weed (and all substances) and started spending that saved money on therapy. Which lead me to self soothing without substances. And working on healthy romantic attachments. I joined my local NA group. I saw a careers counsellor. Got a 10/10 new fella. I sowed lots of little seeds over those 8 months and they have each grown very slowly. It didn't all happen over night. I got hopes and dreams now! I have goals! I want better for myself, and I want to be better for those around me!

I had a super bad car crash so I justified my use but without weed I would probably be on harder prescribed medication , so I’m thanks for that aspect. I have been waiting to quit for a min and I feel today is the right day. Pain I can endure, being lazy I can not. If anyone has any ideas for things that have helped them get through sleep/pain wise, (NOT SUPPLEMENTS) would be much appreciated. Thank you.",2,0

This is not the longest I have went without weed but, it's the less tempted I have felt about it. I started smoking my freshman year of college due to the peer pressures and sheer curiosity. It sent me a loop of smoking everyday, becoming a shell of my former self., gaining weight, isolation and other bs.

I'm now a junior and haven't smoked since the first time I went to a dispensary back in July.  I also lost 18 lbs this year. I ended selling my smoking materials and weed to one of my friends. My main reason to quit was because smoking was something I didn't like doing by myself, it worsen my depression moods and that I want a paid internship in my field, which often drug test. My initial promise to myself was to smoke once I got an internship. I received a internship on on Friday, after I got notification of the offer I had no urge to smoke even though I'm not being drug tested like I thought. I was having a smoking urge just now and I feel better now.

Also my sleep and hygiene habits have been much better. Also, I have had some serious phlegm just about every time I quit smoking. Does this happen to anyone?",10,0

Weed does help me a lot, especially with mental health, but I’m concerned that it could be hurting me in other ways.

Honestly I don’t think I consume that much weed. I usually just vape daily and occasionally smoke regular weed and use edibles. A cart will typically last me 2+ months, and I very rarely use weed or edibles heavily, so I really don’t consider myself a heavy user.

So, after just one day of not using my vape I got all of the typical symptoms I’ve seen mentioned on this sub; nausea, vomiting, anxiety, cold sweats, all that. This is the second time this has happened over the last couple months. At first, I didn’t attribute the symptoms to not using weed or carts, but this is the second time and that’s the only common factor between them.

My question is, how do I figure out if these are withdrawal symptoms or if weed was just helping hide another underlying condition that I may have? Isn’t one day way too short a period of time for withdrawal symptoms considering the small amount of weed I consume regularly? Could I just be more sensitive to it? 

I know this is a question that nobody here can answer for sure, but if anybody has a similar experience I’d love to hear about it.

It's been two weeks since covid took you from our family. The house hasn't been the same without you, but there's this one problem I can't shake now.   


I'm having such a hard time remembering the things we did together, you raised me since I was a child and now I'm having a hard time seeing your face, remembering the places we went, the fun we had.   


I know why, too.   


I smoke too much weed, marijuana has robbed me of memories from my youth. It's taken something so important to me and it took so long to recognize this. You knew I smoked, just like mom does, and it didn't bother you, nor her. You didn't look at me any different, and never loved me any less when I came out and told you all.   


Like so many, marijuana was my one and favorite vice. You smoke and smoke thinking it does no harm, all it does is improve your mood!  


Wrong. So very *fucking* wrong.   


It serves that purpose until it doesn't, you're a high functioning stoner until you're not. Eventually what it takes far outweighs what it gives. After smoking so much, at such a high potency for so long, it will take what it wants from you.   


\-Memories  
\-Work Ethic  
\-Social skills  
\-Overall Energy  
\-increased Anxiety, (I NEVER had anxiety issues before I started smoking)   


I wanna stop now, I'm hoping that if I quit now maybe some of our cherished memories will find their way back to me, perhaps in my dreams. Mom is only a year younger than you, and its my job to look after her now that you're gone. I don't wanna forget her either, I don't wanna forget all the wonderful things you to did for me. I also wanna make sure I have the energy and drive to look after her the right way. I'm afraid I may not have what it takes, which is my heart wails to you up in the heavens. I need to borrow strength from you one last time.   


All the memories I have left of you are of you dying, of you having your first stroke in front of me when you came out of the hospital the first time. Your laboring breath on the breathing machine in the ICU, as well as your cries for help when you were confused and scared. It took seven months for this damned disease to take you from us, and I know every moment was one of suffering.    


That's not how I want to remember you, I refuse to remember you this way. I have to fix this, I have to protect what's left of my family, you were the great guardian for so long, always the boisterous and supportive the rock you were, the very heart of our small family.   


I will see this through. So please, Dotty, wherever you are, just a smidge of strength, please.

Also fyi this my first real I'm done for good' quit, but I've had breaks in the past, rn I'm just starting day 3. I started smoking just under 6 years ago, and have had about 3 real breaks (there's been a few sober days sprinkled in here and there, but mostly it was high everyday, usually all day) First real break was very shortly after I first started (didn't feel like I had any negative reaction at the the time or feel addicted even though looking back it was definitely showings it's signs then) for a month during Christmas break, the second was a month break while on vacation after I graduated college. This one was rough, at the time I purposefully left my stash at home becasue I was desperately floundering in my attemps to control my usuage. The third break was also one month, and I stopped only out of fear I would have a full blown panic/anxiety attack after I had a really traumatic experience while trying other recreational drugs (it actually wasn't a bad trip, but my s.o. had a seizure and had to go to the ER while on it and I had the attack (and a few more in the next few weeks) about a week after the ordeal). I can't tell you how many countless times I've tried to moderate, convince myself that I can enjoy on weekends only, or thrown things away only to dig through trash again later to get high, then get angry at myself and smash the pipe/rig/whatever. I feel like I'm finally done negotiating. I am addicted, and when I have it it's unsatiating and only makes me want more. I know there's been a million other posts on this aub just like this, but sometimes I think it takes hearing a message in a million different ways before it makes sense for the first time. So to those of you who might be questioning wether there's some amount of cannabis consumption you think is 'ok' for you.....ask yourself, what's my track record for keeping promises I make to myself about this? Chances are if you're on this sub and you made it to the end of this long ass post, you need to figure out how you can deal with the grief that will come from the acceptance of your decision to let go of weed for good. That there's NO amount that benefits you, and get to the bottom of all your excuses. In the end, you have to choose for you. Even though I feel like shit and anxious and my night sweats are monsoon like (at I'm sleeping though, thankful for that) I feel pretty optimistic about getting through it all, and just accepting where I'm at and moving forward from that. As one of my favorite fitness channels on youtube says all the time, 'no excuses, just improve'. Don't be so hard on yourself for your current situation, but damnit be as truthful and kind to youself as you can be and always, wether you are in the pits of addiction or at the summit of all you life's goals, try to improve youself and the lives of the ones around you.

The past week has been hard to deal with. Life has thrown me a bunch rocks and boulders to try to knock me off course. On my third day of sobriety, I had a fight with my best friend. I am too tired to lay out the details but it's a miscommunication problem. It took every ounce of me to not use weed to cope with my mental breakdowns. Instead I listened to music to get me through the night. Thank you Phoebe Bridgers. My closest and longest friend helped me remember why I'm taking a long hiatus from weed. I would not be a week sober today if it weren't for her. Another rock that was trying to ruin my sobriety was seeing my coworkers' vapes again laid out on the table at the back where we prep the food. I work at a casual diner restaurant. I had better control, to say the least, but I couldn't help but stare at them. I let two of them know so far that I'm trying to be sober for the entire fall semester of college (I am a pre-nursing major). I hope they can respect that.

The evenings are harder to get by. I am more vulnerable to the night because it was my favorite part of the day to get high.

God has been a great help and strength for me. I went to church alone last Thursday morning and talked to Him for less than an hour. I sat, cried, kneeled, and prayed. Prayed for forgiveness, wisdom, strength, and guidance. I realized just a few minutes ago that this is another trial from God so that I can grow closer to and be reliant on Him. And it's working. I have missed God, and I guess it was about time I struggled in some way to develop a stronger character, to learn lessons, and to seek Him within the darkness...

Anyways, my mom and I get in an argument after I get home from manual labor and with low blood sugar. My older sister was there witnessing it all and offered me some of her vape pen, in spite of knowing I was trying to quit. Immediately I said ""No! That's not going to help!"" She asked if I was sure and added ""...well it helps me chill out and feel better when I'm stressed."" I said ""I'm good, I would just regret it tomorrow. It doesn't actually help anything in the long run""  and then I left the room. 

I told her some time after that I'd appreciate her not offering it to me, especially if I'm stressed. I feel she meant well enough, but her suggesting I have some has been a trigger for years now. I used to cave so easily because she is around a lot. But I've been doing better, and have been using refusal skills.

I’m 31 years old, married with kids. My Job is ok, i don’t really enjoy it but it works for now. Life is overall pretty good, but I find myself needing a crutch of some sort.

I first smoked weed when I was 19 years old, I avoided it up until then because I just didn’t hang with people that were into it. But as I got older I began hanging out with people that smoked. It was cool, we had fun. Most days I just worked, came home and hung out with friends. We drank, and smoked all night till we passed out and then woke up and did it all over again. It was actually a good time in my life, a lot of fun and not a lot of responsibilities. 

Fast forward to 23, my girlfriend (now wife) gets pregnant with my first child. Life got serious real quick. From zero responsibilities to many basically overnight. I started trying to cope with that stress the only way I knew how, with alcohol and marijuana. It was always in the evenings when everyone was asleep. I didn’t really need to hide it but I did because it was my alone time to “destress”. 

At 26 I got popped on a random drug test at work, I had to come home to my wife and 3 year old with the bad news. That was pretty crushing but I made the best of it and we moved on. We struggled financially for awhile because of this but it smoothed out. I quit for about 8 months or so because obviously marijuana was the cause of our troubles at the time. 

But eventually I started smoking again, and have been pretty regularly every since. I’ve taken breaks sometimes as long as 3 months but I fall into a cycle of binge drinking and turn back to marijuana when that becomes too much.

Anyways I feel like I’m kind of rambling but I wanted to get my story out there. I just ran out of weed 2 days ago. My impulses are telling me to buy more, but I’m honestly just tired of relying on it. I want to be sober, I don’t want rely on any substance. I want to enjoy my life and family sober.

This has been my main problem with quitting in the past, I just dont feel more motivation so I eventually figure, why bother. But this time I really want to stick with it, for health and just to not have my house smell like smoke all the time. 

The dreams are something else too. I have a history with nightmares and weed seems to blunt those. But I'm actually in a relatively decent place emotionally and financially, so I'm hoping that may alleviate, I had an ongoing dream yesterday that was not a nightmare. 

Anyway initially I was trying to also quit alcohol, I haven't been perfect with that but minimizing it. I seriously cut down on weed last month, and quit on the first. Maybe I can just minimize alcohol this month, and then quit that too next month.

I’m a lurker and don’t usually post but your stories are very inspiring and have helped me. The last 12 days have not been easy, but I’m starting to feel better. Not sleeping great, but it is what it is.

I’ve been very inspired reading your posts and just wanted to let all of you know you have my support and best wishes and I appreciate you. There is no question complete sobriety is the way to go and brings so much good—even though life can be really hard. 

I am an alcoholic and On August 7th I celebrated 5 years completely sober from alcohol, which is by far one of greatest accomplishments in life. But I have used marijuana consistently (often heavily over that time. Most anyone will tell you that compared to alcohol, marijuana is a less toxic addiction, but a marijuana addiction is still an addiction, and problematic use can fuck your life in a huge way and keep you from realizing your true potential. 

I used two tools to get sober from alcohol: the Reddit stop drinking sub and Nancy Grace’s This Naked Mind. I’m getting the same type of value and inspirational insight from this group as I did from the Reddit stop drinking group 5 years ago. 

I fully intend to celebrate 10 years sober from alcohol in five years with a five years sober from cannabis on the horizon.

Social media is a cesspool and I suspect that on a broad basis it generates more much suffering than good. However, this group (and all of Reddit’s sobriety groups) are powerful exceptions to that, and fantastic examples of the collective good and people helping each other in super positive ways. This is especially poignant during this challenging time and so much isolation.  

I wish all of you the best and continued progress on your sober journeys. Better days ahead….",92,0

I don't know what it is as soon as that year milestone is completed that's when my cravings kick the fuck in properly. I want to smoke with friends and chat absolute shit, I want to enjoy being introspective on a substance level, I want to relax from work coming home and sinking cones making music. That's how I know I'm very addicted to this substance after a year it still influences me.

I am so much clearer and healthier now I'm not high which means. I'm deeper and more connected with my friends, I can have genuine introspection for life and my feelings and then capitalise on that. I now relax by coming home and just playing guitar and creating but with a clear mind and deeper intention. I also picked up reading and it's now the best hobby for me I love that shit. 

I realise logically that I'm far better off and this is another part of my journey. The next milestone is two years that I'm reaching for, I wanted to share this so I can be reminded and others can see that even though it's a glorious feeling to be free. It also comes with responsibility of staying aware and taking actions to reflect and grow to stay free.

That was 8 months ago. I haven’t had a single withdrawal symptom. Haven’t had a single thought of wanting to return to weed. Have been around multiple people smoking weed and still not thought of going back. Now I feel severe guilt because of how easy it has been for me to quit. I have lost so many friends, opportunities and almost lost my little family because of weed.

Of course I am in grieve but I am also happy for him. About 2 years ago he developed dementia and had to live in a home for the elderly. He liked it there and told me and my family so. But he still said that he wanted to die. Not really out of bitterness but more because he said he lived his life and wanted to go without suffering before he was bedridden. Yesterday he fell asleep to never wake up again. When I saw him lying there he had an expression of relaxation on his face, he did not have to suffer. I thanked him for all he had done for me and wished him to be reunited with his two cats he loved so dearly.

What has this to do with weed? I’ve been an addict for about 15 years now. I was off and on weed for the last six months, 5 weeks sober now. I am grateful I found a connection to myself again. I am happy I can sit here and write this in tears. When my father’s dad died (about 5 years ago) I saw the visit to the hospital as an inconvenience because I couldn’t smoke for a few hours… Addiction can really turn you into a selfish piece of shit… I feel defeated right now. But realizing this just makes my decision to not use again stronger.

Be grateful, be humble. Try to be the best version of yourselves and always treat others with respect and love. Life is to short to hold on to grudges.

My first one was dreams, I hadn't had memorable dreams for years but now every night I have exciting vivid dreams and I look forward to going to sleep at night knowing im about to have an adventure.

Second was money, of course I knew I would save money but I didn't count all the takeaways and snacks i was eating before because I couldn't be bothered to cook the food i had gotten in. I've been able to put loads more in my savings for my first house and I'm really proud watching the number go up. 

Third is time! So much more time I can fit multiple activities into a day without worrying about getting home to smoke. The weekends last a lot longer and I get much more out of them. I don't get that hideous feeling on a Sunday that I have wasted the weekend and have got to go back to work the next day.


I really hope I can keep going and I'm trying to practice gratitude for every benefit now that I am seeing the wood through the trees.

I’ve smoked regularly for the last 5 years, and daily in the last 3 or so. 
I didn’t fully understand what was attracting me to this plant till today. I’m just an addict. The only reason I keep smoking is to feed the addiction. Nothing else. All the benefits I thought I would get from weed are illusions. 

I know in the begging was fun. It was new and i remember all the laughs I had with my friends. But it’s not like that anymore and never will be. Because 5 years later I can’t go to bed without having some. Most of the days I can’t even start the day without some. I hang out with my friends and the first thing we do is calling dealers and waiting for an answer.
I really thought weed was something extra, something that could enhance my life but in reality it was making me still. Stagnant. I thought it would help me realise some stuff about my self and my future but the only thing it did was giving me an excuse to do absolutely nothing. I would have ideas about projects and then 0 energy to actually start. 
A lot of my friends graduated and got on with their life. I skipped most of the classes to get high. 
I skipped a lot of family meetings. I gave up hanging out with people that don’t smoke. Tried moderation a lot of times but moderation does not exist when you talk about drugs. At least for me. 
I know weed can be beneficial for some medical cases, but I was wrong to think it could help me. 
The only thing that can help me now is to get back on the track, go back to my studies and give my mind and my body time to recover. 
I really regret not taking opportunities when I had the chance because all I wanted to do is to get high. I lost some stuff that I can’t have back. And I do feel like an old infant that can’t cope with life stress and problems. But this has to change. At the end of the day it didn’t make me creative or relaxed, it only made me more stupid.

Just throwing this out here in case it helps anyone else  - I did the Enneagram personality test and I’m a type nine.

I was a heavy weed smoker starting right before I entered college. The habit grew and grew from smoking small bowls to smoking bubblers, shatter, oil, and bongs. In my 20s, when medical weed was around, I often smoked upward of an eighth a day. Ultimately I smoked for 7 years with occasional tolerance breaks.

In 2018 I had a scary weekend where I felt very manic and noticed weed was making it worse. The next day a doctor diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and medicated me. I decided to never smoke again, to see how the prescription medicines worked and to avoid the horrible anxiety I had. That was in September 2018 and I haven't looked back!

Tracking my progress and celebrating on my quitting anniversaries

Getting rid of all paraphernalia

Hold myself accountable and practice self love by knowing I'm making the right choice for my health

Currently I’ve been smoking for around 15 years and able to be successfully in life. I’ve gotten my own house, a good job, two cars, lovely wife (who doesn’t smoke) and three kids. Everything looks perfect from far away… However I’ always looking forward to the moment I let myself smoke one after diner, never before diner. I like to think of myself to be a good father, not a good husband. 

I’ve never been in touch with my feelings and find it difficult to talk about them. Also the need for one, to get some rest in my head, needs to disappear. So, currently I’ve got some and after tonight, I’ll quit for good. 

Any advise on how to get my thoughts to test?

I had a really bad time in high school. I am 21 now and in my senior year of school and I feel like my whole life has been a blur. People talk about having memories from their childhood and mine is just a big “?” for most of it. Most of my memories are from pictures and knowing what happened in those years but they aren’t actual vivid memories. I think my mental health and substance abuse are so thoroughly linked that they need to be fixed together. Ive tried fixing them separately to no success. Just a lot of failed attempts at getting sober and even worse failed attempts at staying mentally healthy. And yet theres not too many bad things going in my life nowadays. Yet, my substance abuse and mental health seems to just be slowly getting worse and worse. I feel like I am holding on by a thread. And I really don’t want to fail out my senior year at uni. My anxieties are effecting my relationship with my boyfriend and I’ve been hiding my weed use from him almost completely. I know I need help but I also know you can only get help once you truly want to change, and I do, but deep down I am scared of it and I’m scared of not having the closest coping mechanism I’ve used for years.

These past 5 days I have been clean of both cigarettes' and alcohol until last night.  I have been glorifying it like its the best thing in the world.  I know its not,  I have been trying to replace it with working out now, I have also been trying to find something else to do instead of picking up.  I wouldn't have drank last night but I was really angry at the world and at myself.  When I am angry with the world I isolate myself.  

I don't know if it was the weed, I don't see myself like this but I have been getting complaints that I am not an easy person to deal with from people I love.  its upsetting because despite all my efforts, trying to help and trying to do my best, I am still not satisfying anyone.  That's why I am angry.  I have lost people this year and that's no excuse to use, how ever I have been resorting to it and that also makes me upset at myself.  

My mom Died from Covid in February and I just lost my cousin to covid yesterday.  typing about this has made me feel a little better.

I just wish I would stop glorifying weed like its the end all be all.  I think I was in love with forgetting this world at least for a few hours.  the problem was I wouldn't want to come back and deal with what I have too.  That's what made it really dangerous for me.  it would put me in a never ending loop trying to quit and trying to get ahead of everything I should be doing and never getting anything done.  at the end I know it would make me more depressed and that is bad too.   

What I realize more and more is that any pleasure in this world is temporary, you feel good then your back to feeling exactly the way you felt before,  Rinse and repeat.  I think I need to find new things, healthy things that make me happy because weed, alcohol and ciggerettes aren't helping.  theres no exit, suicide isn't an option.  I believe comitting suicide is a very very selfish act, the ones that live suffer because of your not wanting to live.  I have lost too much, my other cousin committed suicide, I think the difference with her is that she had Lupus and was suffering.  as much as I believe it was a selfish act I forgive her.",8,2

It truly blows my mind how people say it’s not addictive. Weed has made my academic performance hit rock bottom and I am so completely disgusted and ashamed of myself. I cant believe I let myself get this low. I always know how much it makes me fall behind on things but I always just want to feel good in the moment. I’ll set important things aside for days/weeks just because I am too lazy. Weed makes me lazy as fuck and I’m embarrassed. I want to be able to live happy and content every day without needing weed or alcohol or puff bars. Weed also makes me break out so fucking much and makes me gain so much weight. I always binge eat when I’m high and I’m talking about EATING. I’m a sugar/candy kinda person and I promise you I can eat more candy than you. So all this sugar was just adding so much pounds and acne. I’m gonna be honest, I’ve tried to quit smoking weed hundreds of times. I’ve quit hundreds of times and relapsed a hundred more. I saw this quote that said “Are you enjoying your youth or destroying your future?” and I am 100000% destroying my future, especially since I want to be a singer and I can tell that weed has negative consequences on my voice. I’m ready to get my life back together because tomorrow is not promised and I want to build a legacy. I want to be great and apply myself because I know that I have potential that is constantly being wasted. I’m addicted to puff bars as well but I figured that it’s better to focus on one thing at a time so that the process is easier. So, this is Day 1 and I truly hope this will be the last Day 1, for a while at least. I just found  this sub and I’ve been reading your stories and I can truly relate to them all. It helps me know that I am not alone and that there are so many others out there facing the same thing that I am. It’s so hard. I’ve cried so many times because of this.

It's been relatively easy to quit - for me, it's always been that if I don't have pot around I don't think of it too much. I don't really crave weed unless I have it, then I want to smoke all of it.

It felt like a pressure inside of me waiting to explode once I got off probation, and once I did I started smoking again. Now, 2 years later, after smoking every single day from since I got off probation I just stopped craving it. Like a week ago, I have no idea what happened but I just got sick of it. No cravings, nothing. And like 3 days after I quit, somebody hit my truck. Usually I would be so pissed, but I just feel calm about it. 

Not sure what has happened, but I can say this is the second time I’ve felt this way about weed. The first time, I felt exactly like this but didn’t last as long because my friend wanted to smoke and I just had surgery so I went with it and started craving it once more. But a week ago, that same feeling striked once again and when I tell you I don’t crave it, I mean it. And before that not to long ago, I just quit Bangs after 2 years and I haven’t had one since I don’t know when. I feel like counting the days of whatever you’re being sober from just puts a lot of pressure on a person recovering. Could just be me. 

Yes since I’ve quit I’ve experienced some anger issues, but I feel like I’m more in control of my thoughts so I’m able to stop my anger from escalating. Sleep feels pretty normal, but what is different now from the time I was on probation is that when I was on probation, I used to have vivid dreams and nightmares plus a hard time sleeping. Now, I haven’t had any of that which I find interesting and relaxing. 

I don’t even think about it, if somebody asked me to smoke I would probably just say I don’t feel like it because I honestly don’t. I’ve been smoking since I was 15, I just turned 20 a couple months ago.
The reason I’m posting this is to see if anybody has experienced anything similar.

I decided to post alongside you guys as I quit and hopefully the daily journaling can bring me some solace and motivate me to keep myself accountable because now all of you guys are relying on me to succeed in my attempt with everyone else in my life.

I just moved away from home to college very far away and the isolation has been difficult. This and the stress of being at a semi-competitive university has had my anxiety through the roof. Over the summer, I smoked nearly daily and multiple times daily and my dependence became outrageous. I've quit for months before but only to get past drug testing and get back on so there was never the pressure of having to make sure I never went back to it. This time it's more serious. My constant marijuana abuse caused me to be absent in my family, relationships, and made me a worse employee. Now that I'm at college and my fate is in my hands, I can't allow it to get between me and my grades and reputation. I've always had pretty tough withdrawal symptoms on past attempts to get clean and the insomnia has always been my biggest issue . I'm determined this time though. 

On top of making my work/family/social life difficult to manage, it made me dull. I've been told I've changed and for the worse. I'm really determined to find myself and get out of this. I know I, and those struggling with me in this forum, can get past marijuana abuse and reach the lives we want to have. It's just a matter of making it happen, bros. Fight the good fight. In Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search For Meaning,* he introduces the book regarding his time in the concentration camps and more importantly his own survival with a Nietzsche quote that states, ""He who has a why to live can bear any how."" 

Folks, I know all of us are here because why have pretty strong 'why's'. Now, the only question is how? Of course, it's my first day and I know it won't be easy, but with the mass of knowledge this forum possesses on how to quit, I know we can all make it, bros.

We spent every second together from beginning of january to june and she quit at the same time as me. We had a deep bond.

We had begun a relationship in about May, and a day before our 3 month quitting anniversary, she went and cheated with a friends with benefits partner from before. When i found out ( a week after) i immediately broke up with her and have barely spoken to her since now. Right now though, I'm really thinking about how we should have never kept it a relationship but rather just a friends with benefits things as it was before. we were never truly in a relationship is what im telling myself. shes an important person to me and ill never forget her ever because of how she helped me overcome the drug that has been destroying mine and my families lives for these years.

What I realized is when I was younger, my idols all used and abused drugs and glamorized it.  Think Jim Morrison, Hendrix, The Dead etc.  

&#x200B;

Now as an adult who has some idea of what he would actually like to be, none of my heroes smoke weed.  They're serious jazz musicians, comedians, financiers.  None of them smoke weed regularly.  They all rely on their ability to think fast and improvise. 

&#x200B;

The more I think about it, I can spot on the street exactly has a cannabis problem.  How?  They might look superficially ok but they're always missing SOMETHING.  Some people are content to be missing that something, but I can no longer afford to.

I'm a great musician, I'm a good mechanic, I'm an ok racing driver.  None of these things are going to improve in my current state.  I want to be as good as I can be and do justice to the blood, sweat and tears my family has put in to give me the privilege to throw my life away.  I'm 17h 14minutes and 57s in.

My main motivations for posting are catharsis and accountability, but I also hope that sharing some of my experience may be helpful for others. I’ll do my best to make it coherent!

I’m going to put the accountability piece up front here, for the benefit of those who don’t want to read the following “marijuana life story.” After a 2+ month period of abstinence and a brief, but solid relapse (just under 2 weeks), I have recommitted to complete abstinence from THC as of 9/1/21 and continuing at least until 1) I have established and maintained a whole food plant-based diet for 6 months and 2) I have established a steady income of $5k+/month from my nascent coaching/conflict resolution practice. \[Note that I am not intending to resume using, but find that setting these long-term goals is more compelling and less daunting than “I will never use marijuana again.”\]

I’m turning 56 shortly and have had a 40 year relationship with marijuana. I discovered it as a teenager and quickly fell in love with how it made me feel and how much fun it was as a centerpiece to my social engagement. I could make a strong case that it helped me survive my adolescence and young adulthood, providing a sort of haven from the constant stress of projecting ”normalcy” while experiencing shame, fear, and loneliness. I won’t dive too deep into that in this post, but being a (100% closeted and conflicted) gay teen in the early ‘80s (for those who aren’t aware, being gay = complete social pariah at that time) was a significant factor.

My relationship with weed has gone through numerous phases since then: devoted pothead through college, casual user in my 20’s (arguably a reasonably healthy relationship at this time), renewed love affair in my early 30s, growing awareness of its negative effects in my mid-30s, and a couple of decades of continually conflicted on again/off again dysfunction since then. 

I’ve quit numerous times, ranging from a few days to a few months, repeatedly convincing myself (at least briefly) that I was capable of re-establishing a healthy relationship with this long-term “partner,” but invariably reverting back to regular, compulsive use that unequivocally has far more costs than benefits for me. One of the insidious things about marijuana addiction (there are several actually!) is that I have never experienced any direct dire consequences as a result of my marijuana use - it has never cost me a job or relationship, legal trouble, serious medical problems (though I did have an ER visit for an overdose of edibles - that will have to be a teaser for another post lol), or financial issues. When I’m being brutally honest with myself, however, it is impossible to deny that marijuana has slowed me down and limited my accomplishments for most of my adult life.

I could elaborate in great detail about the various ways in which my marijuana use has impacted my life, but I doubt that there would be much to share that is particularly unique or enlightening. The bottom line is that I have some goals and visions for the rest of my life that almost certainly will not come to fruition if I keep choosing to smoke.

Another one of the insidious things about weed is that it makes thinking and imagining feel incredibly rewarding. Of course this is not all bad - I have certainly had marijuana induced ideas or insights that have proven valuable - but it seems to make the actual DOING much less compelling. Why expend effort actually DOING shit when it feels so great just to THINK about all the cool shit I COULD do?

Speaking of insights, during one of the more “fertile” periods of my recent relapse, while reflecting on how I was going to get the weed genie back in the bottle (or maybe the bong - seems like a weed genie would live in a bong, right?), I was struck by how many positives there are in my life right now that I can build on going forward. As much as I always preach a strengths-based approach to others, the impulse to focus on deficits is quite deeply ingrained, but I hope to keep reminding myself of how much more pleasant AND effective it is to focus on positives. Rather than abstaining from marijuana use because of all its negative effects, I want to take my motivation from the opportunity that abstinence will provide to nurture my existing assets and to manifest the life that I imagine for myself.

During the recent 2 months that I didn’t smoke, I realize in retrospect that I had started to gain some significant traction on several important goals. Perhaps even more striking was how quickly I lost momentum during my relapse. The good news is that I have nipped this in the bud much more quickly than I have ever done after a relapse - in the past, I would invariably revert back to my previous level of usage and would take at least several months before I made another effort. This feels much more like I am building on success rather than starting over after “failing.”

In my own experience and in my observation of others, it seems to me that the greatest fundamental human drive (aside from the basic survival drives of sex and nourishment) is that of connection, to others and/or to purposes outside of ourselves. For me, my fear of shame, judgment, and vulnerability got in the way of real connection from adolescence and well into adulthood; I have little doubt that my addiction to marijuana is rooted in my efforts to feel less lonely and disconnected. 

Fortunately, I’ve slowly chipped away at that for the past 20 years or so, and I’m at a point in life where my cup is overflowing with connection and support: from my husband, who has been my daily partner in life for almost 9 years; my parents, who are allowing me the privilege of helping them to navigate the challenges of aging; my brothers, who have known and accepted me completely long before I was able to truly accept myself; numerous deep friendships, more than I’ve ever had before in my life; the young people that I’ve mentored, who have given me the honor of trusting me to care for and support them; and my work, which is not only further expanding my community, but providing me with the opportunity to fulfill what I believe to be my mission in life, which (not coincidentally) is all about creating and nurturing connection.

So I think I’ve rambled on long enough - much gratitude to anyone who has actually read this far! I’ll close by quickly mentioning the strategies that have been most helpful to me in supporting my abstinence:

* Completing a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and a Change Plan Worksheet to clarify and reinforce why I am quitting and how I plan to support this change
* Establishing regular weekly check-ins with 4 friends to report on my progress, challenges, etc.
* Running a weekly virtual (Zoom) marijuana addiction support group to create some community with others who share common goals and strategies.
* Engaging fully in the specific goals I have mentioned above regarding my work and my diet/health.
* My latest addition, posting in this group and engaging with this community to both give and receive support around our mutual goals of being free of marijuana.

I welcome any feedback or inquiries. Perhaps the greatest reinforcement for my own journey is the feeling of having a positive impact on others, so please don’t hesitate to reach out, either in this forum or via private message. Thanks for “listening!”",46,0

I’m 21 and smoked daily for about 2 years, I’m also a college student. I just hit a month sober. The first few weeks I went through some normal side effects. I wasn’t able to eat, I had increased anxiety, but I didn’t have any cravings and I didn’t feel like I needed weed anymore. I wanted to get my mind back in control. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, and I think I was abusing weed as a mask for that. Everything was okay until school started back up, which happened to be right at the start of my third week of sobriety. Since this third week I have been having serious anxiety that lasts most of the day, and panic attacks 3-4 times a day. It has been extremely hard to deal with this, as I have never experienced panic attacks in the past. I went into my school’s health center to get checked out because I was constantly aware of my heart beat, and I couldn’t keep negative thoughts and worries out of my head. Every medical test came out completely fine, and I was sent on my way with some prescription medications to use situationally when I felt anxious. I kept having panic attacks in the week after this, and eventually I drove in to the ER to get checked out again because I was convinced that I was having heart problems. Yet again they ran tests and x rays and everything looked completely normal, I was diagnosed with panic attacks and sent on my way again. It’s been over a week since then, and while I still have a lot of daily anxiety, the full blown panic attacks have dwindled, but I have good days and bad days. I feel proud of myself for taking this step in life to be a better version of myself, but the negative thoughts and anxiety continue to eat at me for hours at a time. It’s taken all of this stress and worry for me to realize that I never want to touch weed again in my life. All this time I was so naive about how weed isn’t addictive, and I guess I was naive in thinking that I wouldn’t have extended withdrawal symptoms because of this fact. I force myself to go to class each day, but some of the bigger social events I’m still worried about because of these panic attacks. All I can say is that I’m going through hell right now, but I’m optimistic that with hard work I’ll get through it in no time. I began keeping an anxiety journal, I listen to meditation talks, and I try to keep the thought that I survive every time I get these feelings.

Another bad side effect I experienced that I did not realize was associated with smoking - searing neck and shoulder blade pain! I’m talking about constant and crippling. I did not make the connection that it was caused by smoking and I decided to stop just because of the night sweats (sooo gross).

I startet smoking Weed when i was 17. Now i am 27. At the beginning it was amazing, the high was great with a Lot of laughing, munchies and so on..you guys know what im talking about. After 1 year it eventually became a habit. I thought everything was fine as i was still able to function and to get my shit done. But that slowly changed. After a Few years of daily usage weed was the #1 Motivation of my Life and i only smoked alone because i became really socially awkward when hanging out with people, even if i knew Them Well and liked them. Weed was the only thing i was looking forward to at the end of the day. When i came home from work i startet chain smoking untill i went to sleep. On the Weekend i smoked easily 5-8grams of high quality herb. As you might Imagine my tolerance was on the roof.

Its not my First time trying to quit. But its the First time i changed my mindset. My brain is litterely fried and I dont remember the Last 10 years of my life, thats pretty fucked up. 

Long Story short: weed takes more than it gives to me. I dont want this anymore.

Today i am 1 Week sober from Weed. I am still Not able to sleep but thats okay..i Just have to be patient. The Appetite came Back after 3-4days. Unfortunetely i Had an addicent, which fucked up my ellbow and shoulder. It will Take maybe 2 weeks to heal. But after that i will regurlarly Go to the Gym. I know from experience that working out will help a Lot with my sleeping issues and i gonna feel better mentally.

I’ve felt off all this time and didn’t like this feeling of smoking my life and doing nothing from all day, sat in my couch, joint after joint, doing absolutely nothing.

This morning I woke up feeling like my stomach was a brick and I couldn’t poop. I laid in bed and did some breathing exercises for a while and then had a big satisfying bowel movement.


I’ve discovered that breathing exercises help tap into the body’s natural healing process and promote proper digestion. Also a good way to reduce anxiety and calm the nervous system. Specifically diaphragmatic breathing, or Buteyko Breathing, has been helpful for me. There are a few variations, but here is what I do:

1. Breathe in thru nose for 5 seconds
2. Breathe out thru mouth for 6 seconds
*make sure you are using ONLY your diaphragm to breathe. You can put your hand just above your belly button as a reminder. Your hand should move outward as you breathe in, and inward as you breathe out.

I recently made up my mind to stop using weed in any way, and I want to make sure that I never go back to it.

For context, I started heavily using weed about a year ago. My roomate had been a long-time smoker and i had been doing it occaisonally. He got me a dab pen, and then it all went downhill pretty quickly. I used that pen a lot, and would often hit it at inappropriate times like during work. I was going through a pretty bad time, and i used it to cope, but now im almost certain that im addicted to it in some way.

Today was my first full day of being clean, and i feel like shit, im super irritable and i just generally feel very foggy. If you have any recommendations for these symptoms, that would also be appreciated. Ive taken some decently long breaks before, so i kinda know whats happening, but this is the worst its been. 

I have been toying with the idea of quitting for a while now, but finally decided it was time. If you have suggestions about how best to live a marijuana-free lifestyle(and dealing with the more immediate symptoms of quitting) that would be appreciated. 

As a quick side-note, my roomate is still a very active smoker, and he commonly leaves his weed stuff lying around the house. This makes it hard to just forget about, but hopefully i can just ask him to put it away. Still, im almost certain that i will have marijuana present near me regularly.

Good luck to anyone else who is thinking of quitting, and congrats to everyone who is clean of it now. My journey starts here, and I hope my life will be better because of it.",8,0

Quit cold turkey recently and just hit the two month mark!

I never had a problem with staying active while smoking, more than anything else I used weed to stay productive. For a long time I was pursuing a career path that required me to keep working after I was done with my day job and I relied on weed to tell my brain that I was doing ""fun work"" now, to unwind while still working. In the same way, I also relied on it heavily to quickly switch to relaxation time whenever I could come by it. Nothing like the feeling of finally being able to sit down and watch some tv or play some video games, but WAIT let me pause and run to grab my vape / smoke a bowl real quick before I start or else it won't be as good - I'm sure you all know that feeling. I never felt more like a fiend than in those moments.

Recently I finally quit my day job to make my side hustle my full time gig, so I decided it was time to finally take the leap and quit cold turkey. I would love to one day be able to casually smoke on a day off, but after trying to break the daily habit for so many years and failing, it had become clear that I can't maintain a healthy relationship with weed. So, quitting indefinitely is where I'm at. To be honest, this is the easiest it's ever been for me to stop compared to short term breaks in the past, because I was finally ready to stop. That was always the hardest part, reaching that point and letting go. 

Now at the two month mark, the biggest struggle has been when I finish a project or I'm giving myself a day off. It feels good of course...but damn it would feel so much better if I could do it high. The button in my brain to flip that switch into relaxation mode is gone. Today for example, I had a great Saturday: woke up at 6am to surf with some good friends, beautiful weather, had a nice lunch, got home and did some chores, decided to just relax with my SO the rest of the day and binge our current TV show - but that craving is still so present. In a way it almost feels like a damper on my relaxation time because I feel like it's not as good as it could be. Almost like it's wasted relaxation time. One of the biggest reasons I quit was to be be more present in my every day life, but not being able to shake that feeling makes me feel like I'm moving in the opposite direction sometimes (but I know I'm not, and it will get better with time).

Those of you who have gone through a similar struggle after quitting, how long did it take for those cravings to subside if ever, and to be able to enjoy experiences for what they are instead of feeling like you're missing something? How has your mentality grown over time? Would love to hear from some of you - I've just been lurking in the community so far but the support and positivity has been inspiring. Thanks all!",55,0

Some benefits I've come to realise in this short time:

My sleep has improved and is more efficient, cannabis disrupts REM part of the sleep cycle so even though I'm not sleeping more hours or anything, I feel a lot more refreshed and alert. Just this benefit alone has me a lot less irritatable. I'm starting to think my irritation was from sleep deprivation. 

I'm insanely more talkative. I don't suffer from social anxiety (even on weed) but I didn't like talking to people when I was using. I find myself talking to people and quite often my mouth starts moving before I can even think and then bam, I'm in a conversation and apparently I have a lot more to say than I originally thought. 

I workout regularly but while using i found I was pretty inconsistent in completing my workouts. I was pretty easily able to complete a full workout despite feeling run down from withdrawals and the postworkout high is way greater sober than while stoned. Cannabis disrupts T production so I wonder how far I could've got without using. 

Final thing I've noticed. Time is going really quick, I don't understand this but sitting in traffic doesn't take as long, working my job flys by. My workouts start and then are done in what seems like a blink of an eye. Maybe while stoned I took my time with everything or it just slowed my world down but this is nice. Traffic used to be so stressful but now its done and over before I know it. 

My head is slowly clearing up and I'm very excited to see the world with fresh eyes!

I've been a daily smoker for over a year, and I lost control. Last time I updated (at 30 days) we were on a break due to this and lots of other reasons. Well, the break is over but sadly it resulted in us deciding to get a divorce. We've applied for it but it hasn't gone through yet, but it's official. The first time I posted here someone told me to make my ""getting clean""-journey about me and not my wife, and I took that to heart. It's been tough but my (soon to be ex) wife has still been supportive, and so have those of my friends who know. These last few days have been harder than usual and I've been thinking about weed a lot. I won't let myself fall down the hole again though, it's brought me so much pain and absolute shit that I'm done.

In some ways this clusterfuck with my wife has made it easier too, because everytime I feel the urge to get wasted I just look at my wedding ring (now residing on my night stand) and remind myself of what smoking cost me. I feel good, my wife and I have been on way better terms since we decided to break up and that has been helpful. I also have a date on Thursday which will be my first date as an adult, since I've been with my wife since I was 18.

I don’t need to smoke, I know that well. All that I’ve worked for after countless quit attempts have got me here, ready to be sober. I can’t even smoke in peace anymore. I know it’s harming everything in my life. I’m a different person when I’m not on weed, but if I smoke just once I fall back into the old shitty ways, which is liberating in its own way. It’s literally giving up one thing for everything in life. I can feel the life go out of me when I take that hit, and it’s never the same the next day. The haze makes you wanna smoke again and the enthusiasm and discipline for life goes away. 

I have to want it bad. I’ll fail if my mentality is not there. I was feeling so good being sober just ten days ago, after one nights smoking, I’m back to feeling so shitty and couldn’t get myself to quit for the whole week and a half. Everyday I tried to quit and everyday I said tomorrow. 

The procrastination that we got from weed or already had it works all too well with the addiction cycle of weed. When you say “I’ll do this task later”, in your mind you’ve found a solution for the problem at hand and then weed helps you forget what happened, vicious fucking cycle. But we got to be smarter than that dead plant’s doing. 

My main goals currently in order are to:
1. Breath
2. Eat and drink
3. Don’t smoke weed. 
4. Work out. 

I want to build a good life for myself and it’s never gonna happen with weed around. I know my life is gonna be so much more enjoyable without weed. I want to be happy with the power of perspective. I use to be happy all the time, even tho I lost both my parents before 16 (24 now, been smoking last 4 years). Just not smoking is gonna do me wonders, I’m so sure as it always does. 

I’m gonna try my all time best this time. If I feel bad, it’s okay. We’re learning to cope, how else can we learn without the effort. Gotta learn to say no too. 

Good luck! Usually I’ll say “hopefully I’ll make it” but this time I’m gonna fucking make it. I know there so much to live for.",31,0

I believe, for me, this is a deep and traumatic pain fueled addiction that I intend to understand more and more over time. I’m 30. When I was 22, I stopped using opioids and cigarettes in the same week and my ego always lead me to believe weed was okay because it wasn’t that. This was an unhealthy comparison game that only justified more weed. Years and years of therapy has helped me to get to this place along with a wonderfully sexy and supportive girlfriend. I’ve also had many many failed attempts in both limiting and stopping, however I never counted the days nor did I ever have a community like this to help normalize such behavior. Not feeling alone in his has made the world of difference, and honestly that mentality stretches far beyond weed for myself.

I’ve completely forgotten how to speak to people. For an extrovert like myself, going out and having nothing to speak about just puts me inside my own head. I used to be very popular and outgoing, now I just feel anxious every time I meet people and struggle to hold a conversation with anyone.

Even when I try to quit the depression and persistent anxiety never seems to leave, even if I go cold turkey for a few months.

Here's my deal...  so, as I said, today is Day One of quitting (this time)!  I am ready to choose an overall healthier life for myself and I know that weed knocks me off my game.  Soooo ...  a little backstory and then I would love some advice! I am 48 and didn't find weed until I was 30, but when I did went all in pretty quickly...  stopped smoking with others and it became my own secret thing. It helped me with depression, chilled me out, inspired me to be creative and helped get me into the world of spending tons of time outdoors (which I think was the real thing that helped cure the depression).  However, now the antidote has become and been the poison for a while and I am ready to move on.  So - when I would go out expeditioning and camping with groups (it was my work), I would quit cold turkey - courses were sometimes a week, 30 days, even a 3-month stint traveling with a group!  But would always come out of the backcountry super ready to go smoke a secret bowl.  In last couple years (pandemic and all), all my wilderness teaching has turned to online gigs.  I have been smoking flower - mostly joints, some flower vaping, multiple times a day at least for the last year and a half.  Not having places to go out and people to see makes me lose my accountability and I have always been a high-functioning (and overall pretty secretive) stoner.  My partner at home also smokes  - he has grown our weed recently.  He can cut down and take breaks in a way that I can't casually.  Now we are both wanting to quit.  I trust that he will be able to, and I am not sure about myself.  I am starting a new online project and business that will require me to be visible again... my red eyes, bags under them and puffy face when I look at the photos and videos I am taking of me are reminders that I am NOT walking my talk. Thanks for listening and now to please ask you all for some advice... I know I can do cold turkey as I have in the past - but never successfully at home where I have access.  Thank you for any thoughts you have about what has worked for you - negotiating quitting with a partner who smokes, having weed around, and managing self worth as you go...  I want to be more free!  (the last one brought a few tears as I type... ). Thank you for reading and listening.",9,1

So, here I am, at day 90--free from weed and alcohol.

I'm also tapering off my mental health meds that I went on after my mother died in 2014 because I suspect they are now causing more harm than good. This is my next step and I am going to try and work on giving myself some grace with it. I realize I may not be able to live without my meds, but I figure it's worth a try, at least!

1-7 Days understanding what marijuana did to my brain constant crying,insomnia,anxiety,beginning of derealization seeing the world through a fog.

7-14 Days still crying,improvement although still occurring insomnia less anxiety still occurring derealization feeling like I was high.

14-21 Days Light insomnia, crying subsides, slightly optimistic view of the world.

21-28 Days Insomnia eliminated still light crying feeling that I wasted my life by smoking.

28-35 Days Light hunger that subsided very quickly I was reminded of the derealization that was occurring I still felt like I was high at times.

35-42 Days Derealization still occurring slight anxiety associated with it still feeling like I was high.

42-49 Days Derealization finally subsided and I slowly regained the feeling of being present in the here and now rather than the classic foggy view of the world.

49-56 Days Everything is back to normal although I know I have not regained 100% of my mental faculties but I think I have somehow regained 90-95%.

56-63 Days Improvement in short-term memory no significant other changes.

63-70 Days I have not noticed any changes.

That's it, and I would also like to add that my regular gym workouts and cardio as well as meditation contributed to the rapid improvement.

I may not remember the details, but a lot of people asked me when the derealization stopped, i.e. the famous looking at the world through a fog or being high.

One thing is for sure, everything will pass, it just takes time. The worst was the derealization but finally it let go and I finally feel like I am present here and now :)",34,0

After the coast was clear, i headed out again to move my car with glass blunt in hand.

As mentioned before, I've been stalking this reddit for a while because I have realized the negative effect my cannabis abuse has on me( since around 2 to 3 years ago). With all of that going through my head, i ""smoked"" my blunt (I didn't inhale, so I actually puffed on it). 

And the moment I finished the weed left in it, I smash it against the ground. Felt freeing and terrifying. I asked my BF to hide the weed from me, which he has. 

Guys, I'm so terrified to deal with all my inner demons on my own, but i have therapist now so that can help. Will post weekly updates!

Before weed was in my life, I was on top of the world. Then I got addicted, went from 40k in assets to 70k in debt over three months due to manic spending from the ""mental liberation"" of the drug, lost my best friend, lost my car to an accident that triggered the airbags & had to be claimed as a total loss to insurance to help pay off my insurmountable debt, had to file for voluntary deposit (basically bankruptcy, ruins your credit score for over seven years)... If it wasn't for weed, I could have several hundred thousand dollars in my bank account and be happily married. Instead, I was suicidally depressed for over a year, almost ended my life, had to hospitalised for 60 straight days and falsely diagnosed bipolar type 1, prescribed anti-psychotics that made me feel extremely lethargic and miserable at a root biological level.

At this point, I don't care if I see young adults peacefully enjoying a good puff with their friends. Good for them.

I'm no longer homeless and have been renting a house again for nearly 2 years.

About 2g flower or 400mg dab/Delta8 dab daily. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I also was/am a cig smoker turned vaper, salt nic.

I had a tonsillectomy coming up, but it got cancelled... About 12 days ago I ran dry of bud, and dabs were too harsh for my tonsils. So I assumed I'd cold turkey thc and nicotine... I should have known it was a bad move, but needed to try... 5 days before my tonsillectomy...

Well on day 2, I noticed a weird feeling in my chest, day 3 my bpm was 120 while doing nothing, 80 while laying down. I have anxiety issues and stress issues too that add d to this, but it was not the cause... Withdraws were the main cause I do believe.....

I went to the ER, clocked at 148, felt like I was going to have a heart attack. Everything came back good, except the elevated heart rate. ALSO, I felt so exhausted and the inability to sleep do to not getting baked beforehand and the vivid n wild dreams added to the issue. I have had no other issues besides the sleep and heart rate....

Well on day 9 I couldn't take it and got some more bud.... my tolerance is very low, and my heart still is faster than normal, but I was able to get some sleep, and notice that it is no higher than before when I have smoked, and the last 2 days my bpm isn't as high, yet is still sporadic.

I have seen many people on this sub with heart issues after quitting... And so many have been able to stick to it even past multiple months of these heart problems... I wasn't able to..... I gave in, but I don't know if it's going to make matters better or worse, I know I'm an addict and an abuser of THC and nicotine, dependent... And I know it has to change... But my god I could not handle it/stick to it this time.

I had no intention of quitting, and planned on still smoking both after healing a bit from my tonsillectomy... but now that it's cancelled, I have to get cardiac clearance to proceed, these horrible withdrawals effecting my heart, and my realization of how badly I am messing my life up.... I want to quit... I need to quit... But I can't to it just yet....... 

I hope with the help of this community, I can try again, and again and succeed in ridding my life of this substance or at least the dependency on it. Love to all❤️

EDIT: 4 days since I started smoking again but much less, and sleeping better, and am not as exhausted, or at least not in the same way. However my heart rate is still all over the place and way to high than the normal.",1,0

Ive been diagnosed with adhd at 28. For some weird reason my doc told me people with adhd get addicted to weed way faster. I agree its the only substance i ever took and could continue to use without being to high or hangover to function. 

However now that i have the diagnoses adhd it all falls in place. The symtoms it eased for me when using would come back with a vengeance when i was sober or ran out of weed. 

I believe what it gives you when high it takes from you when sober. And the major thing i think adhders get addicted faster is that it slows our brain where we think we act like a normal human being and continue to cope trough weed cuz it gives us some rest in the head and feel normal instead of this tornado. 

I used to live by the above it was my medicine. Nowadays i realized i did it to cope with evreything. Work  family smoked  before weights or kickboxing a movie sure let me sparks. Weed was my pacifier and i was the baby. 

The hardest part always is the 2 weaks of heat attacks and drowing in sweat at night. Ive got off weed multiple times but then when i think im over it, im like wtf cpuld a joint do. Within a month after that i start using chronicly again even tough i dont want to.

I rarely drank before moving in with my friends, but now that I've gotten a bit more used to it on nights where we're all hanging out maybe once a week, it feels like more of an option to me. The option popped into my head a few minutes ago -- ""you can't use weed but this will work!"" and I almost tricked myself for a moment.

I'd be using it for the same reason I was using weed and that is exactly how the issues started. I caught myself pretty fast but it shook me a bit that I even thought about it for the moment I did. It's so easy to fall on old habits, especially when you change something so small like the substance being abused and say ""hey this is different right?""

howdy!!! 
   
   First time poster here but long time lurker. I finally made a decision I’ve been struggling with for months and decided to not renew my expired medical card. And I surprisingly feel fine, a little nervous bc change is scary but fine!! I’ve been smoking for 10 years with my dependency and lethargy increasing with my age. I was to a point where I couldn’t even leave the house without one or two rolled.

  I’m 24 now and starting to reap what I’ve sown in terms of being on autopilot for years. I’m incredibly excited for this new chapter and what it means for my development as a person. 

  It’s been incredibly hard to quit especially working in the industry but I’m taking it day by day and truthfully, seeing how dependent everyone around me is has been extremely eye opening this past week. 

  I’ve been more productive these 5 days than I was the past 10 years honestly. I finally made a doctors appointment, I’m finally working out and feeling my feelings, and most importantly: I’m finally putting myself first, not Maryjane. I just wanted to share this little milestone with you all because seeing everyone’s posts in here really does help. I can’t even begin to explain how much you all inspire me all the time. 

There have been some negatives, like the fact that I can hardly sleep or that caffeine sends me into a panic attack now that I don’t have to compensate for being greened out 24/7 but all in all this has been my strongest attempt yet. I barely even crave it at this point. Mostly just resentful to all the time and potential I’ve lost from starting so young.

Incredibly cold and weird heart palpitations.,"I'm 21, been smoking for approximately 2.5 - 3 years. I have OCD, can't really sleep unless I'm really tired and even then I barely rest because I wake up a LOT during nights, mainly because nightmares, half my life struggling with an ED, all of this combined had made my life up to the age i started smoking a weird shitshow. And when I started smoking I realized what it felt like to be kind of normal? It helped with my ED, I was no longer struggling with food. I even gained a few pounds! I started sleeping well, in a very good mood. I was not using it a lot, just at night to help sleep, and at parties, with friends, etc. this went on for months until obviously the single toke at night stopped being enough. You know the story. Jump back to today and I really depend on this drug, I need it to sleep, to be okay with people, to help me with my ED, to be calm. Until I realized the tables had turned. Weed after a while started being an obstacle to actually deal with my problems, and even began to NOT help. It just makes things feel numb now, it is an escape, and i have realized I'm VERY addicted. I've actually had my tolerance breaks, never longer than 1 month, but it has never been as hard as this one. Started seeing a psychiatrist, and decided to finally quit. On day four and I feel stupid cold. I live in northern Mexico so imagine the fucking heat, well I still feel cold for no reason. Any of you know like, any scientific explanation for this? It's driving me nuts. I also feel this weird arrhythmia, usually after running, that i never felt when smoking. I feel really hard palpitations afterwards that don't really go away until a few minutes to even a couple of hours and it's worrying me a bit. Anyone struggling with the same? Anyone with an explanation for this?",3,0
1389,2021-09-03 13:21:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ph9ntf/new_here_20m_i_want_to_live/,"New here, (20M) I want to live."," Hello everyone,

I don't know what to say. I feel broken, tired, and ashamed.

I am a college student (20M) who just moved into their first house with multiple roommates. I broke down in front of my parents before moving out yesterday and have been struggling massively for a while. I have been a heavy HEAVY smoker for around two years *every single day* now— this morning is one of the few where I chose not to grab my water pipe and head to my garage to light up.

At age 18, smoking was an entirely foreign concept to me. As I moved through my early schooling (Elementary & Highschool), I had limited knowledge of what weed was and even frowned upon those who partook in smoking. It's funny, though... because I ended up becoming friends with the biggest group of stoners at my highschool.

At ages 15, 16, and 17, I hung out with these guys nightly. I wouldn't toke or partake in their porch circle sessions, but I always enjoyed the company and, as a ""younger kid"" (...come on, I'm 20), I thought it was cool to have an in-crowd. They thought it was weird that I didn't smoke but didn't make too much of a fuss about it other than asking me, ""*So are you smoking tonight?*"" a couple of times every week.

Fast-forward to my senior year of highschool when I was 18— at that point, I had done no substances. I traversed most of my highschool days watching my older brother fumble with different addictions. He started with alcohol but eventually made his way to weed and other drugs. This was all in his junior year of highschool when I just entered as a freshman. He later dropped out of college and had a life shift; this scared me.

Push forward again to Senior year, and I use drugs for the first time in the summer after school— my friends' incessant questioning/downplaying had paid off, and I gave up on making the assumption I'd ""be like my brother."" I actually quite liked the feeling of getting high at first— the headrush, the sensory perception, the laughs, and munchies; I thought it was amazing! **Boy, was I wrong.** I mean, at this point, I was smoking maybe every/every other weekend for a day or two, never buying my own supply.

This ""enlightened"" feeling only continued until I became a daily user who was accustomed to the feeling of being high. However, even after reaching this plateau, I continued using and smoking even more.

The more intense use started after my freshman year at college. Due to COVID-19, I was kicked off campus in March 2020 after only 20 weeks of school, and I have yet to return. With excessive free time due to the nature of society during that period, I was smoking almost every hour of the day, numbing myself while trying to stay busy.

Smoking every other weekend with my friends turned into every single night during the summer before my sophomore year of college. At this point in the summer, in-person school was out of the picture for my sophomore year (2020-2021). This made me massively upset, as I am someone who loves interacting, talking to, and meeting new people. School (along with a whole bunch of other stuff) wasn't what I wanted it to be.

When I went there before my sophomore year, I wouldn't even have fun— I'd usually get too high, too anxious, or a mix of both, and then end up panicking or feeling shitty. Yet, I returned the next day. At this point, I don't know why I kept going back— perhaps it was the fact I considered these people I smoked with my only friends or that I ""needed"" weed to have a good time and more fun. Who knows... but I kept going back.

I quickly recognized how my habits had become unhealthy. Nearing the end of my summer, before my sophomore year of college, I decided to try and stop smoking— as I had begun to feel the mental and physical effects. At this point, it had probably been a year of daily smoking, and I had picked up a MED card to feed my habits.

After August 2020 concluded, I moved to my first ever college apartment at a fresh *19 years old*. I had absolutely no clue what I was doing. No idea how to care for myself, spend for myself, cook, rent, spend money, etc.. I arrived at my apartment and actually stayed true to my sobering up plan... for three days. After those three days, I met someone in college, started my first ever relationship, broke my sobriety to party with them, and didn't look back. I was happy, but only temporarily, and that blinded me. It made me feel like I was okay to revert to my previous habits.

In hindsight, I would say that it was a good relationship, but I made many mistakes. As good as it may have been, it was also short-lived (1.5 months). Jump forward to the breakup in October of my Sophomore year— I cheat on my significant other with my apartment roommate. I had somewhat of a weird history with this roommate, my feelings didn't line up with his, and this interaction seemed strictly sex-oriented. I felt like an item and like I was just performing sex for someone who was using me.

I was inebriated and stoned out of my mind when I was cheating, which of course, doesn't excuse it, but god, it made me feel so awful. I think about how I wish I could go back and make a completely different decision. I think about the sobriety I gave up. I think about how I gave my short-lived sobriety to party with the same person I cheated on. I called my EX over the same night and told them what happened. Things ended shortly thereafter.

My smoking then became day-consuming, even with the task of online classes. I would always be smoking with my roommate. We went through full ounces in 5-6 days, bought carts to smoke when bud wasn't available, and continued on our THC-fueled antics. I continued sleeping with my roommate after ending things with my EX, which only worsened things. My living space became a hostile ground filled with sex, drugs, and disassociation.

I went home for Thanksgiving break in 2020, shortly after my breakup. At this point, I ""wasn't feeling right,"" and I didn't know what to do. I wasn't about to stop smoking weed, for that was the only thing providing me with **ANY** comfort. I concluded that it must've been the anti-anxiety medication I was prescribed for my OCD. I quit my high dose of prescription medication cold turkey and didn't say a word to anyone. I wasn't in therapy or seeing a psychiatrist at this point either. This is yet another thing I wish I could go back and do again. I think that the medication helped me, but I can't quite verbalize how.

I experienced massive withdrawals from my prescription medication that I attempted to smother with excessive amounts of THC. I convinced myself that I just needed to make it through the withdrawal and that I would be okay then. **I was** **wrong. Again.**

As I started coming off my high dose of prescription medication, I began feeling dissociative. Everything is/was happening around me at a mish-mash speed, and things became frozen. I feel/felt stuck in my brain, cemented, with absolutely no way to break free.

I returned to my apartment from my Thanksgiving break even more dejected, depressed, and dissociative than before. The sex with my roommate and incessant daily smoking continued for the rest of the year.

When I went home in late March 2021 for ""Spring Break,"" I took a month's break from all substances and stayed half a month longer than expected on said break (thank god for the online format in this situation). January, February, and March had REALLY beaten the shit out of me. My winter term at college was awful (I think I finished with a 1.3GPA, was cited for plagiarism, and withdrew from a class). Suicidal ideation, dropping out, and intrusive thoughts took the forefront of my thoughts. I would wake up most mornings gasping with anxiety, curled over, writhing.

My month break provided me with some clarity, but I don't remember one day I wasn't crying during that month. It was so hard to keep going. To want to ""feel."" I took some time with family and eventually felt better enough to finish out the year at school, which became my biggest concern.

I returned one last time to my apartment in May 2021. My first day back, I smoked with my roommate. I don't know why. It did not feel good. I fell back into my horrible habits and somehow made it through the rest of the academic year.

Now, I'm here. Moving into a new apartment/house for school with the same former roommate and one other person. I smoked all through the summer, but I found myself asking, ""Do I really enjoy this?"" way too much.

I want a new page.

I want to feel.

I want to experience the things I have missed out on.

I want to be happy.

I apologize for this extra-long post but thank you all for reading.

I would appreciate any words of wisdom or advice you might be able to give.

Best.",14,1

I wanted to give you an update about my progress. I'm on day 12 now and I feel so much better.

I got my first salary since 1 year and it made me so happy I cried. Finances look way better, I was able to pay most of my debts. I'm more motivated to get my shit done and I care way more for myself. I made an appointment with a doctor next week because I want to quit smoking cigs as well. 

I'm working out twice a week and eat healthier. I take more time for myself and I make more progress playing piano and guitar. Most of the fog is gone and I can handle my anxiety way better. 

Mornings are still hard, because I dream a lot of weird shit and the dreams are pretty vivid. I often dream about my past when I was so anxious and depressed and sometimes I wake up with the bad feeling I experienced in my dreams. I still sweat a lot while sleeping.

Cravings are there, but when I get the intense desire to smoke again, I remind myself of what weed did to my psyche. 

I'm enjoying life so much more, I meet friends who I haven't seen in an eternity. 

I will start a therapy in a hospital, where I can sleep at home. I want to fight my inner demons, that are still there.

I'm so happy that I am on this way right now and I feel like my life is in my hands again.

Thank you all so much, that you brought me through the first days, which were incredibly hard for me.

I know that a lot of people will feel the same on here, people like me, who’ve caved in for one day and feel like their “streak” is lost, that they have to start all over again, that think “I’ve already smoked for a day, I might as well smoke again today, and tomorrow” (etc). And I’m here to tell you that that is a toxic mindset to be in. 

The way that I now like to imagine it is like a game of football/ soccer. Everyday I don’t smoke is a goal that I’ve scored. So one day is 1-0 to me, 2 days is 2-0, 3 days is 3-0, and so on. If I score 33 goals (33 days in a row) then why would one day where I do unfortunately smoke make me want to give up? A football/ soccer team wouldn’t give up and walk off the pitch whilst they’re winning 33-1 would they? They wouldn’t think to themselves “we’ve let in 1 goal, might as well let them score another 10”. No, they’d identify the problem they had, and carry on being absolutely beasts, just as you should!

I have been threatened with violence by a neighbor since December of this year. If she had caught me a few years ago, this would all be finished by now. Now? I’m a mother of two young kids. Who also works. I don’t have time for this shit. It has significantly impacted my already fragile mental health. Two total police calls, two separate property managers, and nothing is done. We have court today. The only reason I haven’t smoked is because I REFUSE to let this deranged woman be the person for a relapse.

I'm just over 5 months off weed. But I always have it in the back of my mind, maybe after 6 months I can smoke again, maybe after a year or a couple. There's no point rationalizing it. When I smoke weed, I want to do just that, every day, as soon as I have a little. It is my addiction of choice. Maybe if I had no responsibilities, and unlimited funds I could just smoke all day everyday and live like that. But I have a feeling that wouldn't be fulfilling, or sustain any kind of life satisfaction.  
The longer I am clean, the more I can see all the things I need to work on in my life. I've been supplementing my weed addiction with video games, watching a bunch of shows, and eating entertaining food. These have helped me keep myself distracted as I withdraw from weed, but I know even these activities are things I need to heal from. They are addictions as well. I am not building a life, I am not being productive. I've told myself it's okay to live like this for now, as I'm overcoming a serious dependency, but I have to be accountable to myself, and know that I need to keep cutting away my toxic habits, and working towards something I desire. I've made some progress in a few areas, I've been working out consistently through the withdrawal, I've spent more time with family, I've made progress towards getting a better paying job. So I should give myself credit. But I need to be a hard ass on myself because I have infinite capacity for laziness. I still have a life to live, I intend to find something in life that makes me come alive, and motivates me more than the idea of getting high ever did. So, the longer I am sober, the more clearheaded I become to see, this needs to be a lifelong ""quitting"" of weed. Time to keep improving and create a life I want to live.

I’ve been smoking weed since I first started when I was around ~13 and until my sophomore or junior year in high school was more on and off and had the majority of the time sober. 

After high school I was already a committed pothead and smoked constantly. 

Now turning 25 on the 18th .. I can’t have remembered a day since my adolescence that I hadn’t smoked weed. 

Today my girlfriend broke up with me because of smoking and that she’s had enough(also our 5 month anniversary today). 

Heartbroken and devastated I am gonna commit to not smoking weed anymore because of losing my honey. Now, I have been thinking of quitting since before this breakup  since like I said I couldn’t remember a day sober. 

With the realization that enough is enough I’m going to quit but my life is surrounded by it including my friends. I’m hoping I can find someone to help me along this journey and can come to as this will be a hard journey of breaking a 12 year addiction. 

Thanks for hearing me out.

Also, this is my first post on here via mobile.

I’ve been smoking since I was 15 and I’ve been hooked on it ever since. I was completely oblivious to what affect it had on my life until recently. When I turned 25 earlier this month, I realized that weed was only making me tired a lot, lazy, reserved and a bit timid. Also thanks to it, I have social anxiety too and it made me super paranoid. Also didn’t help with my appetite so I never gained any weight.

I just quit about a week ago and when I was out in public yesterday, I don’t feel my body shaking like I’m stuck in a freezer. Coincidence? I think not.

So the reason why I said I quit weed at the worst time is because I just left my old job at the airport (I used to push people around in wheelchairs. Good tips but pay could’ve been better) for a job at the warehouse. Unfortunately, the new job didn’t work out because it was too far. It was like a 2 hr. bus ride but they had me scheduled from 5am-1:30pm and buses don’t run until 4:45am where I live so I would have to uber/lyft but I couldn’t afford to. The manager at the warehouse also said that there were no other schedule openings for me so to make the long story short, they let me go after working there for one day.

Now here I am, Reddit. No money, no job and rents due on the 4th so I’m going to have to talk to my landlord. I won’t be able to get my old job at the airport back because I called off so much because I just wanted to get high and watch YouTube and browse Reddit. I screwed up tremendously, it’s no one to blame but myself. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t screw up quitting weed but the withdrawals on top of stress and depression is way too much for me to deal with. I couldn’t sleep at all for the first two days post-quitting and I only ate one meal a day because my appetite is so messed up from the withdrawals and depression. I’m taking it as a punishment for my own good because I was too irresponsible when I put weed first before my own priorities and got myself in this major situation which made my already existing depression even worse.

What am I doing now? I filled out several applications so far and I’m going to fill out much much more until I at least get a call back from one of the jobs I applied for. It’s been five days since I last had a smoke and I don’t regret quitting it at all. I just regret not being responsible with it. I’m sure my future self would thank me later. All I gotta do is sail through the rough waters until I reach the shore.

Thank you guys so much for your support!

TL;DR: I quit weed about five days ago because I became too irresponsible with it and now I’m facing the music.",6,0

if you have no ability to access weed, your brain gives up the attachment & its ez. the only way to get past the attachment is by going in with full committment: you are done for life.

Today I decided to write a reflection about my weed quitting journey, which started one month ago when I finally admitted to myself that I have a real problem.
My problem was the sever addiction which I was facing. I had to smoke everyday, otherwise I would have severe cravings and I would get my hands on it in every possible way that I could find.
The day came, and I compared my life before becoming a weed addict and my present life at that moment. I realized that my motivation had significantly decreased on my work, I was facing financial difficulties due to buying weed everyday and my relationships with people were becoming less and less interesting and I was starting to hate the world.
I was sure that it was the addiction to weed that were causing my problems, I just knew it for sure.
I decided to quit it for good.
I haven't really been 100% clean this whole month. I have relapsed a few times, when I was offered some weed.
On the positive side, I have decreased my weed usage by about 90%, and I have completely stopped spending money on it. The best achievement I feel though, is the fact that I think I have somehow battled the feeling of addiction inside me. I can now imagine living without it. Sometimes I come home, and when I realize it's one more day that I haven't used it, I feel so fucking proud of myself, it's like I am alive again.
Please, know everyone, if at any point in your life you start to doubt if your weed usage is doing any good to you, then there is a huge reason for your doubts. It makes you think short term and forget that you have a long life ahead, and it makes you unable to direct your life in the right paths.
Stay healthy everybody, I love you all !",10,0

I suffer from bad anxiety and depression and last month when I tried going sober, it was such a mess that I tried hurting myself. 

I’ve tried looking into going to a facility that helps with co-occurring problems like my addiction and depression. I almost feel like I can’t treat one without the other, but I can’t afford anything like that bc my health insurance sucks ass. I know I can’t keep smoking and wasting the little money I have though.

Basically I just really need some words of encouragement that I can revisit the next couple days/weeks until everything balances out. I know quitting is better for me in the long run, but I’m really nervous about the detoxing process., I plan to stay strong though!

Of course as I got older smoking got out of hand, the legalization in my state combined with the pandemic basically led me to be high daily for months at a time. Now I’m trying to get my shit together. 

And turns out, the initial clean up period isn’t the hardest part (for me it’s 3-4 days of mood swings, depression, etc.). No, it’s when I catch up somewhat with my work projects, take care of bills and stuff around the house, start being social again. Then I inevitably get a little voice in my head that says “*Whew lad, nice job unfucking your life, surely you deserve a little TREAT for all this hard work and accomplishment! Don’t worry, since you’ve unfucked yourself and know how bad being high for weeks and even months is, you can totally just smoke for the weekend and then stop!*” 

I know that this voice is wrong, and I also know I’ve fallen victim to it plenty of times. It’s calling to me now, in anticipation for the long weekend, but I’m holding on. Don’t know if that voice will ever stop. I suspect not, my dad is an alcoholic, and the voice doesn’t go away for him even after years of not hitting the sauce.

It DOES get better.,"You guys, I went through hell and back. All in all the mental breakdown lasted 9 months but I didn’t quit weed until the last 3 months of it. So just making it known that this episode was not triggered by cannabis withdrawal or post acute withdrawal syndrome. 
But I was using sooooooo much to medicate my through-the-roof anxiety. Quitting weed made it worse. But it wasn’t until I opened up to my psychiatrist and counselor about my weed use that I started to get better. I was prescribed a medication that helps with withdrawals and cravings. I was able to “come clean” about the whole truth of my anxiety and issues that included addiction. I was so ashamed of this. But it wasn’t until I was ready to check in to a mental health hospital that I finally just admitted this very complicating factor to them. 

I wasn’t perfect. I used once 3 weeks after quitting. And I used for 3 weeks after about 2 months of quitting. That was difficult to stop again. Now I’m working on alcohol. I think something in my brain just finally decided that I was done with addiction. Or I wanted control back. Or I wanted to not feel like I was keeping a secret from my family and therapist. Or I didn’t want to keep endangering my life and health. Or (the biggest reason), I didn’t want to risk losing my kid. I’m a healthcare professional, I was risking my career, too. 

I remember through my addiction, I could not fathom not using, living in reality. I also could not fathom truly quitting, the act of not using.

The road of (not to) sobriety is a journey, not a destination. It’s bumpy as hell. You don’t start over, you keep going. Every bump or long mile, changes you. After a few of these you look back and realize the person who first started this trip is not the same person you are now.",1,0

And even if I don't smoke ever again, I'll still be. But that's okay.","This was the realization that set me on  my current iteration of quitting. It's not been long but it feels different. And I feel like I should share it. I just hope it won't discourage anyone, but whatever I say here is about myself only and I wouldn't dare presume about your own journey. 

For context, I'm 34y/o and daily user (2 to 3 joint/day is my usual)

The times I ""quit"" before, I always thought that after I'd pass the ""withdrawal"" period, I would be free, like if someone would hand me a joint I'll think to myself ""Hey I don't want to smoke right now"".

But time after time, after periods as long as a few years, I never did. Even after the cravings stopped, lingering only as vague sentiments of nostalgia, even if I could control myself to not buy anymore (and that was the only thing that really worked), the first feeling I have in presence of pot is  ""Just smoke it""™. It's difficult to describe this feeling with words, maybe at least some you will relate.

This feeling never left me.  I could act on it, or not. Many times, I did, and it was good. I enjoyed it without the pressure of thinking that I could relapse into what I'd called ""regular use"".  Sometimes it was not as good and instead reinforce my drive of staying sober.

But eventually, it always led to the same vicious circle it had always be. I'd buy some and restart all of it again. It happened so many times I can't even count, and my memory is so fucked up by now I don't think I could even recall.

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe someday I'll stop feeling like a slave. Right now I just don't see it happening. And it sucks.

But what I know see is that I think I didn't really quit all these times. It sure helped me in many ways, but I feel like it wasn't the real deal. 

Facing this realization is. Accepting that I'll always be struggling and maybe, that permanent, long term sobriety is not even possible. That some physiological/psychological damage have been done, and can't be undone. Relationships lost and never recoverable. Stuff-to-deal-with pushed aside and their consequences irreversible.

I lost so much already. But I have to take responsibility for what I do.

I'm addicted to weed, and I feel I'll always be. Freeing myself is, and will be, a constant battle. But now I know I won't stop fighting.",19,0

On my second or third or fourth sober sprint, who can remember. Two weeks in this time, last time it was two months. The time before that, who knows. I'm slowly realizing I've been ignoring the root of the issue. It's easy to get wrapped up in the simple justifications for quitting: the physical effects, the fading of the high over time, the way your lungs feel, the expense. The practical reasons are so easy to grab and hold on to because they seem like things that can be remedied and in the back corner of my mind, I secretly tell myself can go back to enjoying weed again once they are. My tolerance will fade, my money will replenish, my lungs will heal. 

But the truth is that it's not really about the weed, is it. It's not about the high that makes me feel alive and joyful and spontaneous and free all at once. It's the siren's song of a beautiful escape from an ugly mind that can't feel those things on its own anymore, if it ever really could. 

So I can wait a month or a year or five years. I could never smoke again and replace it with something else. Alcohol, spending money, sex, harder drugs, porn. Spin the vice wheel whatever direction I want and find a new way to forget myself.

But the horrible reality is, no matter how thick the haze and how euphoric the high, I'm always there at the bottom waiting for my mind to come back down to reality. My damaged mind was there before the weed, and it will always be there after, patiently waiting. I just can't outrun myself. 

I'm not sure why I'm writing this except to say that I finally found the issue, and it's not the weed. I read about people saying how much better they feel after quitting, and I envy those people. For me, beyond the immediate physical effects of withdrawal, quitting just makes me remember how unbearable life is trapped inside a head full of rage, depression, anxiety, feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, and self-hatred that no amount of abstinence from vices alone will ever permanently free me from. 

I intend to stay sober because I'm exhausted by a lifetime of avoiding fixing what's broken. And maybe I can't really be fixed, only time will tell I suppose.

What I know is this: if it's not about the weed in the first place, then weed won't and ultimately can't be the answer either. The physical withdrawal will eventually go away as it always does. But sometimes what you're left with after is the much more frightening and darker journey to take into the depths of why you needed it in the first place. I believe that journey is worth it even if I'm not sure where or how it ends for me. 

So stay strong, surround yourself with supportive community, embrace sober introspection, find small moments of joy wherever and however you can, and above all: please be kind to yourself and others. We're all works in progress.",170,0

First: being I no longer have issues trying to fall asleep due to restless legs. I used to think weed helped with restless legs but honestly I think it just causes the issue more than anything because now I never have the issue. 

Second: In the short amount of time since not smoking I’ve already lost 5lbs!! I would always eat a late night snack or two and always super unhealthy snacks. Now I barely crave any snacks. 

Third: I don’t have the constant feeling of mucus in my throat. I used to cough and bring up phlegm and it was kind of embarrassing (especially during the height of COVID). Now I barley feel like that. 

Lastly: I always noticed my heart rate would raise significantly whenever I smoked and sometimes I would “green out.” I’ve noticed my heart rate seems to stay much more consistent and doesn’t elevate nearly as much.

I mainly hit my pen, with varying types of cart strains. Starting back in March, I would hit my pen every other day. But once summer came around I would hit it much more frequently. By the end of this past summer I’ve hit my pen every single day, mainly at night before I go to bed and usually when I go out to party or hang with friends. 

About 4 days ago I decided to stop cold turkey. Ever since then, at random I’ll start to feel floaty like I’m high, very mildly but I can tell a difference when it hits. Additionally, I’ve been incredibly anxious these past 4 days, almost having a panic attack every day. I keep disassociating from my body at random times, like I’m looking/controlling myself from a distance. I’ve never been a very anxious person and I didn’t start smoking weed to calm my anxiety, just for fun. The last time I had a anxiety attack was more than 10 years ago. The anxiety has made me feel super sick and scared. Unable to sleep or eat since 4 days ago. 

No one ever told me that this could happen, and it’s been freaking me out lately. But good news is that today has been the best day so far. I haven’t felt as nauseous and my chest doesn’t feel weird anymore, I’m assuming from not being as anxious today. All this crap I’ve gone through in just four days has probably deterred me from every touching my pen again. It does make me feel better that I’m not alone in this situation though. 

I guess the worst part about all this is that because I would only hit it before I would go to bed, I haven’t been able to sleep very well, if at all. I’ll wake up in a sweat or panic and will have to watch anxiety meditation videos on YouTube. 

I feel like I need a hug, like how your mom would comfort you when you were sick as a child.

Don't get me wrong I was already a pretty bad cart smoker since they were just so convenient to me while working out, being at school, being at work etc. But after the surgery when I had no energy or want to do anything,  I added on around 2-3 joints a day and 2-3 grams of wax a week on top of the cart I was already finishing before the week was up. Now that I've recovered I've looked back and realized that I wasted quite a bit of time just being stoned out of my mind not interacting with people or being productive and the feeling of that is quite a knife to the throat to me since I see myself as an outgoing overachiever usually. Now I have a lateral ankle surgery coming up next month (being an athlete and bingefully smoking didn't mix very well for me) and I'm looking to improve myself and not waste all the time I'm going to have sitting around again while recovering. 

&#x200B;

I hit a friend's pipe 3 weeks ago just once after already starting a small 4 day break and after that I came to the my realization that I actually want to get my sh\*t together, even if I have the self excuse to smoke a lot because I'm ""injured again"". Since then I've really had no urge to smoke but definitely have been feeling some intense withdrawals. I've been very depressed, very socially anxious and have been having trouble making or keeping conversation with almost everyone, have had intense brain fog or like my mind is just TV static half of the day and have been experiencing some derealization, especially throughout the 2nd week. 

&#x200B;

I started working with a personal trainer to start bulking up and get healthy again and being in the gym really does take my mind off these feelings. Even though my overall feeling and mental clarity are quite down the drain, I'm very proud of myself for going this long so far and still feel very committed to going much longer because I know it will get better as time goes on. Patience in key.  I've fallen in love with my sober state of mind again instead of the lost stoned one I've usually had.

Hi Martin this now to vent and or relieve some stress and hopefully get some encouraging words from my fellow Tokers who you want to quit.

In advance I apologize for any typos as I'm using voice to text feature on my phone.

Anyhow I've been a pretty much nearly daily smoker of the past 9 to 10 years. I have a family now and a house as of December this year and a lot has changed. I have recently just begun giving up out call and am now finally trying to give up marijuana which has always been a crutch for me. I know in my own mind I can come up with any excuse always and whenever to quit but it's most likely not worth it in the end. I unfortunately was dumb enough to buy an eighth of medical grade hi THC content MJ this weekend. However I know if I was to stress that out for the next week or two I'd be stoned out of my mind not being a good father and not as productive with work. I have lately been running 2 to 3 mi everyday or every other day as my body can tolerate to help deal with the stress and anxiety.

This morning I took one hit and before I went on a walk with my wife and son in the neighborhood I literally threw out my entire eighth of medical grade good THC MJ. I toss it down the storage train where I need I could not retrieve it and all the attempts even if I wanted to. Right now it is a little after 7:00 p.m. East Coast just got off work and I'm already having a little bit of leg anxiety knowing I don't have my weed to help comfort me and be with me during my downtime in the evening. I just wanted to make this post reach out to you guys know that hey I'm a daily smoker I've almost a decade and I feel my s*** away and I'm going to fight this. Any words of encouragement or wisdom are appreciated if not please let me use this as a vent. Thank you all and good luck to everybody I know you can do it!",2,0

I grew up not smoking weed and was pretty against it (I was one of those kids who believed in D.A.R.E. haha) for a long time until 2 years ago when I saw it became more mainstream and accessible at dispensaries etc 

I went from no weed for my whole life to taking edibles almost every day until my tolerance got to where I needed to consume more than the original doses to get high. Eventually switched to smoking pre-rolls and that was much faster and stronger. 

I thought weed was supposed to be healthier than cigarettes and help with relaxation and pain etc. I’ve substituted smoking cigarettes for pre rolls instead

My quitting journey has been in fits and starts, most I've been off weed is a month. This time feels different, more emboldened and i feel that the past times I had ""quit"" was just practice.

Weed had its place but like a tree in autumn I too need to shed those past leaves that I've accumulated.

Weed can be insidious. The way it allows to be cool with just everything. Everything is bless. A safety blanket to numb the sharp edges of your emotions. This way, it's able to facilitate it's growth as a plant. It's symbiotic relationship its had with humans has ensured its survival. It's highs is like the sweet scent of a Venus fly trap, seducing you to a cocoon of haze where life will drift you by.

It becomes a weed in the forest of your mind. Overtaking and suffocating all the flowers that could germinate.

Weed is known to help creatives but rarely people talk about the physiological effects of weed. The lethargy, the munchies, the eventual succumbing to sleep. A sleep that pulls you down to its comfortable depths, that you don't even realise you went. Plenty of times I've chilled with friends smoking, only to fall asleep and waste the time we were to chill together. Those creative inspirations usually end up in conking out without much done.

As much as weed helped, and it did help, to assist me being more comfortable, more relaxed, more intuitive. Its time for me to let it go and go without. It was training wheels, but time to ride without.

So, I've joined here and I hope to help people on this journey to free themselves and experience life RAW. Without the aid of weed. As one youtube put it (Sneako) doing drugs is just cheating.",20,0

The last five years or so, I’ve been dry herb vaping. 

I’ve probably smoked every day for the last decade.

It’s my main pass time and I spend most nights chilling on my couch listening to records. 

Recently I’ve been feeling like I want to quit. 

I’ve been working at home since the pandemic and got in a really unhealthy habit of firing up as soon as I clock out. 

Some weeks I’d not leave the house. 

I’d get up for work, get high after, go to bed. 

Rinse and repeat. 

It was particularly bad during the winter when I’d get up in darkness and go to sleep at night without going outside. 

I bought a new vape only recently and discovered the cheap ones I’d been using before were set far too high. 

I’d been struggling with lethargy and feelings of paranoia for the past six months due to it. 

But this has improved since getting the new vape and using the temperature settings correctly. 

It’s meant my whole evenings haven’t been a complete write-off locked to the couch. 

I’ve got a good job, an amazing home, a great partner of nine years and a dog. I can easily afford my habit. 

My social life has taken a dip, but I don’t know if that’s due to being naturally solitary, if it’s due to the pandemic, the fact that I’m at the stage of life when my friends are getting married and having babies or the weed. 

There are plenty of reasons to give up, chiefly, just seeing if it makes any sort of difference. 

The problem is, I set myself a target of going three weeks cold turkey today. 

I’ve been feeling really tense and anxious since and telling myself it’s okay to have a puff now that I’m using a better vape. 

I’ve been trying to reason with myself thinking I could just smoke every other night or just at the weekend. 

But I suspect if I go get some, nothing will change.

I can't get more than 1-3 hours of consistent sleep, my dreams are WILD like they were in highschool. I've felt so exhausted all day, every day for this week, and my heart is racing bc of it, until I lay down. I tried to go to work and halfway through I had to go to the ER, my bpm was 130 and if felt like an alien in my chest and I was gonna faint.

Everything came back normal, but with my heart history (SVT, then cardiac ablation in HS, 5years ago) they kinda think there's a small tachycardia.

But like .. is it all fucked up withdrawal.. I can't get any sleep and I know that's a BIG factor..... I really wanna just smoke a blunt again before bed and hope for sleep without dreams and get a full night of rest...",1,0

I’m 20 now and I had a huge problem with weed addiction for 4 years. I lost a loved one at 14, did not cope properly, got depressed and I started to try escape my mind. I started drinking first & hated it’s toxicity and I found “peace” with numbing myself with weed. It wasn’t peace at all it was the illusion of peace and the illusion of happiness. I got addicted to other drugs too along the way but weed was my drug of choice. I alienated myself from society, became a lazy shit, never exercised, had an inflated ego, a big victim mentality, resented the world, lied to others and myself constantly and was a horrible person to live with. I put my family through hell with my addiction. Thank god they intervened and paid for my addiction therapy. When i stopped smoking and drugging i got bad psychosis for about a month it was awful. I couldn’t trust my mind I had delusions, thought everyone was out to get me and heard voices in my head. Im so blessed that it only lasted for a few weeks. I cut contact with friends who still used which was very important. I tried to go it alone at first and kept relapsing as i was lonely in my recovery. I realised I needed Narcotics anonymous. My therapist told me a great way for relapse prevention.. HALT.. if im Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired these feelings can lead to relapse. I attend Narcotics anonymous at least 5 times a week and the Na meetings and 12 step process are integral for me. The opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it’s connection, connection to other addicts who have the same goal of bettering themselves. I am moving back to college in a city today and looking forward to a substance free college lifestyle. Starting a new job tomorrow in a hotel too. Life is good at the moment I just have to stay doing the right thing now and  the right thing will happen. If you are struggling to quit a substance. Get help. You wont do it alone nobody will.

I write this for 2 reasons. 1 is a bit of desperation - I hope if I reach out I can get back on track. Talking to people here seems to be the only thing that ever worked for weed sobriety.

 The second reason is to remind anyone whose brain wants to trick them, that you are so much better off without weed. Don't give in, keep staying sober 1 day at a time. It is NOT worth it.",51,0

I'm looking for a little inspiration on this sub. I only smoke weed at night after work and on my days off I don't let myself smoke until at least 4. Lately every morning I wake up I feel like I want to quit cause I'm just so tired all the time but by the time I end my day and get off work again all I wanna do is smoke. Usually because I'm so tired and it makes being tired more comfortable. 

I came to this sub to get a little motivation and most the post I see are from people who were smoking all day. Has anyone here quit after just smoking in the evenings? If so were there any major changes or benefits you found after quitting?",29,0

Gotta admit this pandemic wasn't really beneficial to my attempt at stopping/taking a break/quitting smoking weed. I'm the type of person who keeps going back and forth, spending more time smoking and less time being sober.

As of last Friday I've officially finished my college program. Now I have a bunch of goals and plans in mind, but smoking keeps getting in the way. The longest break I had was 10 days during winter break in 2019. Since then I've obviously been smoking and struggled to stop.

More recently I went four days at one point during August, until a moment where I mentally and visually went black and got myself a bong and started smoking again. I desperately do want to stop but it's hard to quit doing something that you've been doing habitually for about 6 years now. But it's something I really wanna do so.... here I am ready to quit.

I'd rather do good for myself than do bad with a bowl. Looking forward to being a lot more active in this sub.",2,1

Some things are just plain better high.   


I resist the urge when I'm bored to contact my friends and do other stuff instead, which means they end up elevating my status. Since I smoked weed I've always been the cool friend who's attention is sought after.  


Back in old friend groups the sober me was an annoyance who hit people up more than they hit me up. With weed it was the opposite and everyone was so desperate to hang out with me.   


Same principle applies to women. I was more blaise and didn't care and they loved it and gave me way more attention.   


In fact I never really was a guy who could date and pursue the girls I actually wanted to, until I had marijauna helping me, chilling me out.

All is going well albeit I had one joint on the Monday after a long bank holiday weekend. Now, the question I have is have I reset myself, in the sense that I’ll have these night sweats for much longer now?

I started smoked weed about five years ago, I think. I smoke so much i truly can’t even remember when. 
But I’ve been smoking since then. It has truly helped me. It was a point in time where I was depressed, and suicidal. I used to call the suicidal hotline and just cry to the operator until they had to hang up. 
Since smoking weed that first time however many years ago, it has helped that depression.
However, I use it as as crutch. It has become a staple in my life, and I’m realizing how sick it is. 
I wanna stop. I started looking at this thread, and it makes me feel scared. Addiction is real. I’m addicted to weed. I think I’m scared because if I get depressed again, how will i ease my nerves? When I get sad, I get SAD. And the weed helps, I just hate dealing with myself sad when I’m sober because of how I was when I sad when I never smoked. If that make sense. 

This is my first post, and i don’t know if it will get any traction. But any words helps.",78,0
