Title says it all. I used to smoke to escape my negative thoughts about my future (like work related and money stuff), my persistent negative self-judging, and just to forget life basically.

Well after over a decade of this, I have finally realized that weed doesn't have help me deal with my problems, it just makes me forget about them, and when I'm un-high I'm weed-hungover and my mental problems are right there waiting for me. And they've been snowballing (not too bad, I am financially secure and I have work), but the constant judging myself has been quietly building up in the back of my mind. And it relates to not being able to quit weed, or even get it under control. I knew I had a problem when I said 'ok, I'll go 24 hours without smoking then smoke tomorrow night"" and I couldn't even do that.

And now that I'm 3 weeks in, my procrastination and low self esteem seems 'unmitigated', in that I have nothing to make me forget about it. Like it's just on all the time in the background, I can't mute it with weed (even though it's not really muting it, because I can feel tension in the back of my mind). And I don't want to mute it anyways, because I need to see if it's true or not, and if its not then I'll talk back to it. And if it's true then I gotta take steps to change it so I am living in a way that I am happy with.

I don't even want to smoke, so I guess that's good. But really I see now that I have to work on myself, I have to spend my time doing things that will bring me closer to my life goals. Weed has really been holding me back from that. I would smoke to forget that I have a long road ahead of me, and it would just delay me starting out on that road. I feel sad just thinking about it. 3 weeks ago I would've thought about it and just smoked and watched some dumb shit on youtube. Well I'm not smoking but I am watching dumb shit on youtube, and binging reddit too. So I need to decrease my time on those things and increase my time on other stuff. It all seems so impossible, so insurmountable; and I don't want to think about it. This is a mental problem that I have identified recently.

Now that I am sobering up, I still have all the same problems I had when I was high all the time. I thought it was the weed, like I thought a week in I'd be this super productive , best version of me. But that really was wishful thinking, my brain taking shortcuts, trying to convince me that it will be so easy. Well I'm realizing that it won't be easy, or happen overnight. It will take months or years of persistent effort. Definitely years for my life goals. 

I am trying to keep a 'cognitive behavioural therapy' journal/diary. I was introduced to it many years ago during counselling at my uni's free counselling for students (a decade ago). Well I am trying to stick with it now. Even typing that out, I feel like a failure. So much wasted time. So much wasted brain space. Well I am moving on, can't turn back the clock. And I guess I am a little grateful I got out earlier than some too (although I constantly compare myself to others and it brings me down). I have a cousin who is 6 years older than me and been chronic since highschool, and just all around acts like an idiot, well I don't want to end up like him. You know those 'olympian wins gold at 17, what have you done??' posts, well those actually make me feel like shit, like for real I get sad. When I was growing up my dad would never compliment me or say anything encouraging, even when I graduated from my bachelors with first-class honours, nothing. And as I got older and had a pretty much 'par for the course' life, instead of feeling ok I felt like a failure, like I should have done more, I should be a big shot. Well obviously I would smoke to forget that. Or I'd smoke to daydream that I was a big shot, or I would be a big shot right around the corner. Not addressing my low self esteem, not addressing why I think I'm 'not good enough' right now.

It's all aspects of life too. I can't take satisfaction in anything, because it's never perfect. There is always some flaw that I focus in on (this goes for my own self assessments too). I would smoke to forget, and when my tolerance got up, I would smoke more to forget. And when I was feeling bad in the morning, I would smoke to then. (I've always been smarter than my peers so I've been able to get by being stoned, even in uni I was stoned all the time and still got good grades). It like when I was young everyone said 'drugs are bad, don't do them', but they never said 'you can ameliorate your mental health this way' or 'people develop drug abuse problems when they can no longer face reality, make your reality more bearable'. 

Well there's more to write but I feel tired now. Hope someone can relate to this.",5

It’s strange, I was thinking after 2 months I was going to be sooo high from that hit, I mean I was but I was still 100% functional and able to do things around the house. That tells me that it’s STILL somehow in my system and haven’t been fully clean?

Quitting is probably one of the hardest things to do. I’ve struggled with quitting and relapsing so many times I lost count. I stop counting. You surround yourself with friends who love weed as much as you do. They don’t get your addiction. It’s just weed. People smoke a lot more they say. I don’t know you guys but this shit sucks. You spend so much time telling yourself that you aren’t an addict, maybe you have anxiety or maybe your being a drama queen. Eventually you push the thought away until it comes creeping back again. 


I started therapy last Nov for severe depression. I was smoking my life away. Showing up for meetings high. Going home on my lunch everyday to get high. I would drive 20 mins smoke 5 mins go back to work (another 20 mins)...My therapist recommend antidepressants and AA. I skipped AA but took the pills, my negative thoughts about weed went away, I can control it, I’m not an addict I said...

For the past 2 months I’ve smoked more weed than I have my entire life, I’ve been smoking for over a decade. I’m going to quit. I’ve decided. It’s time, and deep down I feel that it is. I spend hundreds a month on weed, I eat takeout pretty much everyday, I’m a 31 year old pothead who doesn’t know who the hell he is outside of smoking weed because it’s my friend. I let my medical marijuana card expire. I’ll run out this weekend....I’m nervous as hell....the dreams scare me the most....I’m going to try writing my thoughts and Marijuana Anonymous.",3

I've always felt I can only be who I am when I am high I feel like people won't like who I am when I'm not I feel like I can't be the real me when I'm not stoned

But I'm excited for the journey ahead to make some big changes to help myself believe I can do anything I want and can achieve anything I want as long as I push myself to do so and keep myself motivated I should be able to do anything

I'm going to start using a lot of my time to exercise and workout

I have never been in a a real mature relationship so I'm excited to make this change its going to be a long Journey but hopefully I'll meet someone who is deserving enough for my time and my energy because it's going to take a lot of work to become who I want to be 

I'm hoping I can look back one year from now and can tell myself congratulations you did it",7

It is fucking crazy. Sometimes I feel normal and optimistic, but some days I feel almost suicidal, although I wont act on that. Last week was alright, I did a lot of stuff and I was Even optimistic, but yesterday I woke up with crazy anxiety and depression and feeling worthless and I wasn't able to elevate it, although I meditated, made myself a training, etc. The only time I felt normal was when I was dancing, but Apart from that time I felt like on the Edge of falling apart and overwhelmingly depressed. I am Not the giving up person, so I still went to 2 Job Interviews, I still survived calling and visiting guys to fix My washing machine, I tried to go to dance jam with my friends, but I got panick attack on the way, so I came back home, tried to calm myself down, then I managed to get out on the date with one guy. But the feeling of worthlessness is totally overwhelming, I feel like a total failure. And from the outside I seemed like a happy, optimistic person, but it was just a mask.

Anyway, it is novelty for me. Everytime I quitted smoking before after about 1 month or even less I was feeling alright and not depressed in any way. So I was thinking that my depression and anxiety was caused by weed and later by weed withdrawal, because I was quite stable and optimistic after being sober for some time. Once I managed to be sober for 4 months, which means I literally was clean of all Shit including cigarettes except 1-2 coffees a day and after 1 month I felt Like at the top of the world. 

This time is different and it is scary. I was thinking before that My  crazy weed usage was a reason why I was behaving bipolar, and quitting weed Always gave me hope for the better.

Now I cannot Control my feelings and I know, that before when I was sober I was able to apply all the healthy Coping Mechanisms. So I know them, I know how to practice them, but I just don't feel strong enough. I struggle a lot to try to focus on gratitude, and Even if I succeed it goes away in every occasion, when something goes wrong way. I AM sick of that. I AM neglecting some trainings, I AM afraid to meet My friends as I feel worthless.

I start to feel like maybe I have some kind of mental illness, which is fucking scary. I started to smoke a lot when I was 14 and I started to drink heavily at 11, so I didn't even know how am I without drugs until the Age of 29. Later I started to giving Up all the Shit for months and everytime it was a nice experience and i felt clarity, optimism, I was able to handle Stress and I was Feeling confident in these sobriety periods.
Now it is 2 months and I still feel unstable, I start to think, that I might have some kind of mental illness.

But to tell the truth, I also had hard time because of the coronavirus, I lost the Job I loved (music&people related) and therefore now I have to look for some full time position in IT, because in My country nowadays it is impossible to find nice job that will pay the bills, I also had to end relationship, also before I was doing good musicaly, I had some concerts, now nothing, my home appliances started to break one by one and this is Not the time, when I have a lot of money coming in, I had a sincere conversation with my brother about how some of His behaviours influence me and now he is giving me silent Treatment for 1 month and I live with him, so it doesn't feel good, and this all might be contributing to stressing me out. And I feel like I should be somewhere else career, friends and relationship-wise. I also see, that in Order to survive I won't have that much time for music, and therefore I probably won't make it, which is a new thing - before I was able to set my life around the music and therefore I was able to progress quickly.",2

I thought I was slowing down the external stresses and giving myself a moment to breathe.

What really happens, however, is that *I* slow down. The rest of my life continues along at full speed, and I'm running to try and keep up. Weeks then months flew by during quarantine, and I didn't understand why.

I was your typical stoner through university, my other stoner friends and I would create our own “snow days” as an excuse to smoke weed all day and skip class. After university the habit stuck with me and I would go on benders of smoking weed every day for months at a time. I’ve taken a few breaks during the time, mostly for work, but lately I’ve been getting back into smoking almost daily. About 3 years ago I suffered a pretty bad concussion and wasn’t able to play sports, which was heartbreaking to me because at one point during my life hockey was the be all end all and I was playing a pretty high caliber. After my concussion I convinced myself the weed was helping my recovery (ha!) and I would smoke every chance I got. Recently my girlfriend got into playing hockey and I would be pumped to have the house to myself so I could smoke weed and chill. Earlier this week she told me that she had a practice/skills session and the first thing that popped into my head was “bing!!! House to myself, I’ll be able to smoke as much weed as a want!” Lately, I’ve been really conscious of my weed intake and I’ve been trying to cut back a lot and hopefully eventually cut it out all together, so I was a little disappointed in myself that this was my initial reaction... I’ve been feeling really good lately and I’ve been able to work out like I used to and not feel any symptoms of post concussion syndrome (woo!!) so instead of sitting home and smoking weed, I went out and bought a new helmet (mine has been broken for a while, preventing me from going on the ice) and went out on the ice for the first time in about 3 years!!! It was great!!! And I was so pumped about it that I signed up for some shinny tomorrow and DAMN does it ever feel amazing to be back in the net! (I’m a little rusty, and slightly afraid of the puck, but I’m sure that will change) For those of you who are struggling, it gets easier. I still crave it like crazy sometimes but each time I say no to myself if gets better and better. I downloaded the grounded app to try and hold myself accountable - It sucks having to reset that clock. Keep on keeping on and find things you love to keep your time occupied.",14

I've connected with many friends and all of my partners over it. My husband smokes too but has only had the habit since meeting me. We now have a 1 year old son. I quit whilst pregnant and was probably our happiest 9 months together, possibly a combination of no weed and levelled hormones. We picked up the habit again when he was around 3/4 months. Whenever the going gets tough its what I'll go straight to as whilst high I'm totally chill about life and can often come up with great solutions when Im stoned. 

BUT the downside is I suffer from major aggressive mood swings. Always have. I suffer with depression, father killed himself and was an angry depressed man so I think I must have his blood. Some days its fine and other days I just get so fucking mad! My marriage is crumbling after only 2 years (6 years total together), not just the weed but I'm sure its making the problems 1000 times worse. 

Been smoking every day for months now, New dealer just round the corner with cheap deals making it harder! Currently trying to resist smoking but feels pointless when I've got a 1/4 sat there... Feel like I should just smoke it up and then quit! Quit a 1000 times before, never seem to make it more than 4/5 weeks until I celebrate by buying more weed.

I was pretty fired up about sobriety going into my self isolation I was getting so many projects done, going fishing a ton, etc. But I'd be lying if I said being stuck in my house for 10 days didn't weigh a little heavier on the ""maybe I do want to smoke"" side of things.

I am glad I made it through the isolation without screwing up my sobriety. Now I get to go off on a family vacation. My close extended family will be present. Thankfully we will have plenty of space to social distance still. I am just so genuinely happy about getting to spend time with my loved ones after being locked up in my house. I can't remember the last time I was this excited about going to spend time with family. A month ago I would have been too worried about weed to even commit to going to spend a full week with them. While on vacation I would have said ""no thanks"" to many activities just because I needed an opportunity to get out and smoke some bud in privacy. This year I will not be held back by the ganj. It is going to be a blast!

Thanks for keeping me on track /r/leaves you folks have been invaluable.",6

Long time lurker, first time poster. I used to go through and oz and a half a month but recently I had enough. My anxiety was extremely bad and I constantly had the munchies. I’m diabetic so the munchies made my blood sugar soar over 300 daily. I didn’t help out around the house like I should and barely engaged in hobbies. Fast forward 11 days and I’ve done a complete turn around. My anxiety is manageable now. I’ve stuck to a low carb diet and I’ve even started exercising. My weekly sugar average is currently 158. I’ve been helping my family out and rediscovering my hobbies. My advice is this. Really think about your priorities and have a heart to heart with yourself. You gotta put your heart into it and decide your sick of it. Best of luck and best wishes to you all. I love the leaves community and I’m greatfull for all your posts. It keeps me going.

My question is, is it possible to experience PAWS after withdrawal symptoms were no longer seen for a decent amount of time?

I don’t eat shitty foods, and I eat fruits and veggies every morning when I wake up, so is it just my IBS maybe? Or could it be PAWS?

I smoked daily to relax and 'enjoy things' for years until that state becase my baseline. I would need to light up every few hours to try to get back to that baseline, never really reaching it. It made me miserable. 

So I quit. I just didnt smoke on June 1st and the next day, and the next and kept waiting for the fog to clear.

I'm almost there it feels like. I don't crave it, I almost enjoy the little things now, I want to keep going.. 
But crazy stressors (house sale, possible separation) have been creeping into my life and causing doubt. My husband said I've been more anxious than ever and when I quit drinking, it took me 4 months to calm down so I have at least 2 to go.

Well, I didn't do it guys! I called Samaritans (a charity in the UK who helps talk you through a crisis, for non UK folk) and felt a little better after.

But then! I had a vivid dream last night that I did the opposite. I scraped out, and smoked up. I woke up this morning thinking ""NOOOO! I worked so hard, why did I relapse yesterday!? Today is Day 14, why would I take that away from myself!?"" It took a good few moments to remember the truth, and it was just a dream. I'm a big believer that dreams simply run through scenarios to better prepare you for if it happens in reality. I just really didn't enjoy experiencing the worst case scenario.

I was feeling clear....like, CRYSTAL clear during those 2 months of no weed...I honestly still felt very moody and irritable at two months and by the time I got to AL and my husband left (military) I was like...yooo...I NEED to smoke! 
( a lot of those emotions could of been from moving stress, being in a new place, being alone in a new place, dealing w the unknown of COVID)

But, Once I smoked...I was unimpressed... The high reminded me why I stopped! I was sucked back into regular every day usage! Feeling guilty after every hit and as I chill out stoned AF, my brain tells me “should of quit, just throw it away” but when Im not high my brain tells me “you need a hit just relax and calm down” “you will feel better” “you need me”
What got me through the days was knowing I could go home and hit the vape...

I am Nervous and hoping withdrawals do not hit me as bad as the first time...it’s night 1 and I’m experiencing restlessness... its mostly the irritability I don’t like...feels like never ending PMS ..

And sweating a lot. Once I get through this and my endocannabinoid levels return back to normal, and I can sleep normally again, I don't want to have to go through this yet another time. I want this time to be it for good.

Being high all of the time started to feel like all of my senses, my whole self, was wrapped in wool. Now the wool is coming away. The feelings are more intense but it's a better way to be. More Present, and more Aware. I'm worried I will crack and give in.... but if I do, then I will have to repeat this detoxing process all over again. Ugh.

I've been asking myself the question - a version of me that smokes, vs a version of me that doesn't smoke... is there any way that the version who smokes could possibly be better than my sober self (or even ""not worse"")? I doubt it.... I can see the ways where it's holding me back from accomplishing as many of my dreams as I would like to. As many nice times I have had smoking pot, I don't think it's worth the price it takes against my ambitions, my wallet, and even just my lungs, my eyes, my allergies that act up (yet that hasn't stopped me from coming back for more 🤔)

In the moment when I smoke it, I get the illusion that it's calming and evening my emotions. But I also wonder and question whether it's actually making me more emotionally reactive on balance....

But it's still hard to give it up.

Being underslept is adding up to more stress.

Funny enough I didn't even realize it, which compared to counting the days when I first started out, I'd say is a great improvement.

My epiphany I had just now was a realization of a greater desire in me than just to get high: the desire to face life and everything it's got. I've been a pretty regular smoker for the last 7 years. Daily primarily, only ever taking 6 months off for legal trouble. Classic tale of being a college dropout who did nothing but hang out with their stoner friends. Constantly high, lack of foresight, and the idea that that was the only way to live life 100%.

Wow, how wrong was I. Over the last month I've asked myself over and over again if quitting weed is really what I need. How would I handle my anxiety? My depression? What about my friends? Would they still want to be around me if I wanted to stay out of the smoke circle? Would I still have friends?

Turns out that by developing a closer relationship with myself, I stopped having those concerns. In fact, I've learned of WAY better methods of dealing with my emotions and mental health! Meditation has definitely been one of the best tools I've learned, followed closely by opening up to the people in my life about my emotions. 

Instead of believing that being high is the only way for me to feel better, I'm going to continue to believe in my power to handle feeling bad. Cheers to everyone else on their journeys! I believe in you, too.",31

Please don't fall into this cycle. When you quit , quit for good. But also if you get back to it don't lose heart. Learn and move on.

Listen to everything you think sharpens the light. Don't fall for petty things. Life has more profound things to offer. Like self respect. Self actualization. Self healing. Self decipline. But all this is not selfish. It is the begginning of beings selfless. Like a child, make your way up. It's fun. You laugh, you cry, but at the end of the day you reach the sky.

Any support helps! Please","After a year of lurking on Reddit I finally joined! Its the need of support to quit weed that inspired me to join.

I am 33 y/o and have been smoking daily since about 16 y/o.    As a kid/teen I always had depression, except I am from a Mexican family so I had no idea what depression was or anything about it, so I just always thought I was down for no reason.  I always acted out to over compensate for my mood, do things like stealing, causing mischief, and any other BS i could do that would cause a feeling of excitement, ect.  

Then I discovered weed and suddenly the depression was masked!! I used daily, multiple times a day ever since than and the longest period I have had without it is two 3 month periods, and that was inspired by potential drug tests to get a job.

Now i am trying to quit agin because its really not as fun as it used to be and i dont even get that high anymore. I experience lots of brain fog! 

I have always had insomnia as well so that's another issue,  that quitting is going to bring on the insomnia and depression, maybe even anxiety.  I honestly feel so much better just typing this and putting this out into the universe.  Any insight, motivation, stories to share would be super helpful.  I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and I especially thank anyone who responds.  I am inspired my the creator of this sub with 22 years sober.  Such an inspiration.  

I believe taking on a healthy lifestyle and keeping busy helps, so recently I took up learning the play the piano, I bought a skateboard and have been riding it, trying to learn tricks, and of course i changed up my diet and have aimed to drink plenty of water.  If only the gyms were open!! I am in LA and Covid shut us down again. 

Good luck to everyone on the journey, much love, peace and positive vibes.",3

I am a traveller, I love to go backpacking and camping and do so almost every weekend. This last weekend I went camping in a new area, so I smoked up and explored like I usually do. It started to get a little late and a thunderstorm was coming, so I knew I had to find a place to set up my hammock and tarp, except when I got back in my car, it wouldn't start. 

I started to freak out because I was in the middle of nowhere and I know next to nothing about auto mechanics, so I packed up my backpack with almost an ounce of weed (everything I had in my car), my wallet, and a bunch of other gear. My plan was to walk until I could find somebody to help, but if I got lost along the way, I still had weed, food, and other stuff. And of course the first thing I did before leaving my car was smoke up.

Well, as it turns out, I only had to walk about a quarter mile before I flagged down a mountain biker, who came with me to my car and quickly knew what was up and fixed it. I was so ecstatic; I thanked him, got in my car, and drove off.... Not knowing I left my backpack on the ground next to my car. I don't know if I ran over it but I'm sure it got soaked in the thunderstorm. 

I drove maybe 2 hours out before I realised I left my backpack. I freaked out again and tore down the mountain roads until I got back to my campsite, but my backpack was gone. 

This backpack had been with me to all 7 continents. I've travelled with it for years and years and it became one of my most treasured possessions. So, I figured its time. I lost it because I was stoned. 

It made me realise: I am so dumb when I'm stoned. I'm a physicist, but because of this habit, I have been struggling to complete classes and I've been neglecting a lot of tasks for my research group.

I have so many more reasons I want to quit, but this was the icing on the cake. My resolve feels stronger than any other time I've wanted to quit. I just hope I can stick to it this time.",552

Therefore, I pretty much bypassed the first two days where it is arguably the hardest.  It is silly because I quit for 4 months before and started again when lockdown happened.  I won't make the same mistake again because I forgot how horrible the first week is - this is going to be it!",13

Hope everyone is well! My last post on here was posted the day before I decided to quit. I am now on day 4 (3pm here in Scotland) I never thought I’d be able to manage it but here I am :) I have used cannabis every night for 2 years to numb and cope with my bpd (2-4g a night). I was at the point where I could not sleep or eat without it and I was a recluse. My husband had taken over the childcare and housework duties because I was literally nothing more than a groggy zombie. Everything in my life was being affected by my cannabis use. My withdrawal symptoms so far are - constant dull headache (my brain feels very tense) an uncomfortable, tense feeling all over my body, cold sweats and shivers, my stomach is very bloated and upset, and I feel at times too sick to eat. I can eat a little but not a lot. I feel full of a nervous energy - the only way I can describe it is my brain is very much awake, but my body is not. I’m also not sleeping well, I finally manage to fall asleep around 3/4am and wake up early. I also wake up a lot during the night. I’m trying to keep myself busy to tire myself out but my brain is still very much awake at night. I was just wondering if anyone has any tips or advice on getting through these withdrawals?

I also sleep noticeably better the days I get any extra exercise.

I started dream journaling to gradually work towards lucid dreaming. I figure I'm having several vivid dreams a night so why not. After I journal I also try to do a bit of interpretation, nothing too Freudian-esq, just stuff like 'there were a ton of unwelcome guests in my house - maybe I'm feeling crowded or overwhelmed in my life.'

I've noticed since I've been journaling my dreams have been getting less unpleasant. I haven't been having anymore nightmares though honestly most of the dreams in my life have been nightmarish so they don't seem to bother me too much anyways. I've even started having some degree of success in my in-dream endeavours. Last night I was able to run up a hill, something I don't think I've ever actually been able to do in a dream (a recurrent theme).

I'm feeling encouraged (of course it's morning and my mornings have generally been okay - the anger doesn't come around till mid-afternoon, when I'd normally smoke) that this dream-work may be helping my day to day attitude.

Anyways, best of luck to anyone struggling. Journaling helps!",5

Previously I had a longer break from weed, about 4-5 months where I smoked about 1,5g from friends etc. Things were pretty good, I had good sleep, memory was functioning better and I felt sharp. Then against my own advice which had kept me safe, I bought weed once again. Just 2g at first (then 3g), some to give back to my friends and most to myself. I thought I can probably keep things safe by only smoking at night-time and preferably not everyday. Well after awhile I noticed that while I don't smoke a lot per day, I do not have almost any weed-free days. Things still seemed okay, my sleep wasn't terrible or anything. I could take a break, but I just didn't ""want to"". 

So now I've been smoking again for bit less than a month, almost everyday. Everyday I wake up my thoughts are at this point: weed, and munchies or something pleasurable to fill the feeling of void in my life. Honestly it's so easy to persuade yourself to smoking by saying ""I've nothing better to do"", or ""I'd rather start tomorrow."" I recently had 2 breakdays in a row, and I just felt quite irritated. I felt good about taking the break but I noticed how my body/mind had started to get used to weed again, and ""needs it"" for balance, homeostasis.

Now to what the title suggests: I have less than 2 weeks to practice songs and guitar because I'm applying to a music conservatory, and music is my passion. I feel like I am afraid of failure, and I procrastinate because I demand too much of myself. ""What if I fail"" etc. It's ridiculous that I keep smoking instead of practicing and using my time for my own benefit and happiness. I just play games or watch youtube or eat unhealthy food to feel good, but in the back of my mind I know this is not what I should be doing. I feel that weed is an escape for me. An escape from responsibility, an escape from life and relationships, an escape from taking charge of my life and doing what I truly want and stop living in fear.

Now I'm not saying I was ultra-productive while sober, but I NEVER, and I do mean NEVER regretted the sober days. Even when I had good or bad days, it always felt okay--it felt like I'm moving somewhere in life. Now when I smoke, it feels like I wake up in the morning in regret? Everyday feels like a cycle, like I'm doing the same shit pretty much, and then waking up unsatisfied with myself. And still I think about smoking right in the morning. I've been thinking that maybe my body isn't feeling so good about this chemical being ingested all the time? Sure enough, when I've felt shitty before smoking, smoking does balance the shitty feeling out, but it also gives me anxiety at the same time (I also live with my parents and I have to hide it so that's extra stress for me). **Also something to note:** everytime I've had months of break from smoking, and I vape just a little bit of green, I feel so incredibly anxious. I think weed puts me partly in a fight/flight state and thus gives me energy and makes me more aware (fear makes you more present), and it also makes me SO self-critical like damn. Idk why I get back to smoking, clearly it's fun at the start. Something new, new thoughts and ideas and feeling good and being creative, but that fades pretty quick, once I get ""used to"" weed. Then it's a task, a chore, a necessity. Soon I begin to avoid people, plan my day when I will smoke, I'm not motivated in social situations, my memory is shit and I'm slow with words etc. I'm sure you've experienced some of this, and it just sucks.

I think I'm done for now guys. I have to start doing good things for myself, instead of procrastinating and toking. Partly I'm making this post, to really exemplify my situation to myself and to be responsible. I really want to get into this school, and I've nothing else going on right now.

I’ve been clean before for 1,5 years and from that messed up by smoking on a vacation.

I just threw out everything related to weed and began my journey of quitting. Quitting for good this time. 
A couple things I’ve noticed:
-Mood swings are decreasing, my mood is a lot more stabile
-My cravings are way down. I haven’t been craving weed since I realized I just cant smoke ever again. And I’m okay with that.
-I’m way more motivated. I want to do things and I feel worse when I just lay in my bed and watch Netflix, so I’m being productive instead
-My thinking cleared out, no brain fog, I feel sharp finally
I picked back up my good habits of going to the gym regularly and cooking healthy meals/ meal prepping. 
I’ve also began to search for the cause why did I abuse weed in the first place. I’m reading/watching videos a lot about psychology and self improvement too which helps me with that.

It took about a year and a half to finally not roll a blunt. I used to be a 6 blunt a day kind of person. It was disgusting and expensive. Backwoods are not cheap.

My habit dictated my decisions. Everything from outtings with friends and family or doing work was based on when I can get high. Cancellations so I can get high. Leaving an event early so I can get high. Getting high before going out. 

Feeling sober felt like a drug, being high felt normal. 

Everytime I was with family and friends, I felt like a B-list actor, someone who was trying/pretending to be myself but was never true to myself.

One day I was on the government marijuana site about to order weed when all I could think about was how expensive it has become($9-15 per gram?!?! What the F man!!) and it won't get me as high as the high I've been chasing for years. Then all of a sudden I started to feel turned off by weed. 


If I buy this weed, the dollar value does not justify the high it gives. 

Now, whenever I think about having a smoke, I think about how expensive it is and the high will be mediocre at best and that's not worth it. What a waste of good lungs and longevity. 

It's been 3 days so far and my withdrawals have been light. I'm not as irritable as others, but one thing for sure is that my dreams have become quite vivid. Just last night I had a dream where I went to a cottage that's an air bnb, but a family member who lived in the cottage died so they kept the body in the basement to be transported to a morgue the next day. The basement was old, like a basement you would see in a ww2 movie. Dusty, dark, damp. As I arrive to the cottage, no one was there, the residents seem to have left earlier. As I settle in, I can hear bumps, creeks and objects fall on the ground in the basement. I investigate and see what looks like an old gypsy lady veiled in black with a semi see through cloth hanging over her face which is barely visible. Her face was pale and boney, hardly any meat in her face, just skin and bones. Her eyes are soulless. Black sockets, nothing inside them. As I see her, she senses me, I run upstairs and out the front door. She starts to chase me outside, but she is moving erratically, her body twisting and turning in weird ways as she gets closer and closer. I am trying to run, but my feet are heavy to lift, I tried to yell for help, but only a whisper leaves my mouth, my body feels weak and I can barely push her away as her hand grasps my wrist.

During this entire dream, I can feel everything like it's real life. The fear, exhaustion, hopelessness, dread. My housemate entered my room and woke me up, she said I was trying to say something, but she couldn't make out what it was. I was yelling for help in my dream and in reality, I was trying to do the same.

I've been smoking for 19 years straight and after quitting for 3 days so far, it's the dreams that get me.",4

My appetite is non existent, it took everything in me to have a smoothie and a bagel in the last 48. Pro Tip: Smoothie was easy and went down and had a ton of the nutrients. The bagel was a bad idea. I am having some insomnia tonight. No irritability, and my intrusive thoughts have already began to subside. My normal pick up days were Friday and Monday. It felt good to not see my dealer. I’m taking every hour as they come. One by one. My motivation is that I won’t be spending 1k a month on weed. That I already feel like I am more present. My best friend called me today and we talked for an hour. At the end, he told me he felt like he was talking to his best friend from 2018. I feel sharper and wittier than I’ve felt in ages already. Keeping busy has helped immensely, and I’ve already found that I’m enjoying being out of the house not stoned waaaaay more than I was enjoying being out of the house stoned. I’m filling the moments in my day when I’m not occupied or distracted and feel bored(my weed trigger is boredom and anxiety..) with meditating, and practicing my breathing. Time also feels like it’s moving quicker than it has. Sorry if this was rambling, but it feels cathartic to have this community to post in. All your posts and support for each other has been such a joy. We’re not alone. Stay strong, keep pushing, tomorrow’s a new day.",5
2020-07-28 23:21:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hzt6qp/3_months/,3 months 🥳🥳,"So weird to think that I somehow made it 1/4 of a year without weed. Some things that have noticed that have changed to give you hope if you are just starting:

1. I no longer think about/have the urge to smoke weed everyday- it doesn’t even cross my mind unless someone I’m with suggests smoking 

2. My moods are slowly stabilizing- it’s much easier for me to notice when I’m getting angry and I can stop myself from getting upset, whereas before when I was burnt out or sober I would get irritated for no reason and not be able to stop my moods. I still feel sad a lot, but I’m more likely to do something productive to deal with my sadness like go for a run or call a friend instead of waste the day away being high only to be in the same mood again once my high wears off 

3. I am a lot sharper. I have noticed myself able to remember things more easily and keep up intellectually with normal people lol. My therapist has noticed how much faster I’m able to process concepts and how quickly I can pick up and implement new techniques I have learned 

Best of luck to everyone. This sub kept me motivated every day. I love reading everyone’s stories, and I promise you, you can do it. I believe in you :3",30

I was convinced that if I became a habitual toker,  at the end of my shift and on weekends I would be able to really get my creative groove back and love creating stories again.  

However,  as mentioned,  I haven't written anything at all this year.  I think I'm smoking to block out my issues (my father died this year,  being single and short at my age gets to your head). When I smoke,  I eat as much as I can and watch YouTube or play a game until I fall asleep.  

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I ran out of weed last night... I'm tempted to ring my dealer up... but it hasn't improved anything. I've quit adderall and smoking (cigs) so this won't be a challenge compared to those beasts, I'm not worried about quitting.  It just feels like...i could be smoking.

I'm only 23. I started smoking heavily at 18 when I went away for college. Started off so innocently, but the bud quickly became my way to ignore anxiety and numb my emotions. I was the cool, fun guy after being a nobody in high school. I felt alive...but I wasn't living. To everybody else I was the chill stoner guy that got great grades and people looked up to for doing it all...but I hated myself for long stretches.

I smoked a lot the first year out of college too. I lied to myself that smoking at night was a ""reward"". I was simply pushing the nightly thoughts that caused anxiety during the day aside. On the one year anniversary of starting my career... I felt a need to make a change. This isn't the life I want to live. I've seen this drug ruin so many young people in college.

Because of this he thinks I am simply avoiding him because I don't want a relationship. This is making him resent me.

Now the only time he speaks to me is to say something condescending. Most recently he chastised me for storing food in the wrong bowl,  before that he called me irresponsible for not replacing a light bulb in my bathroom. Its never just asking me to do something differently, its a very condescending lecture and speaking to me like a child.

Im starting to realize my dad doesn't have the emotional intelligence to say what is actually bothering him so he harps on things like the light bulb. But this addiction is so out of control that I cant just stop. Its fucked up many other areas of my life, I NEED to stop but I have been struggling to for years.

Its hard to estimate how much weed I smoked a day in grams because I would buy it by the oz and just roll joint after joint. I would go through an ounce in probably 4-5 days. 

Since I been laid off my gf has been buying the weed but she is outta money too (she isn’t working right now either). I was so desperate to smoke today that I took a blade to a bowl and tried to scrape the resin off it and smoke it (I realized how unhealthy it was and that is what brought me here)I already exhausted all my other options of weed. I literally smoked every single bit of weed I could find in my room. 

Now here I am. Sober. Stressed. I don’t even know what to do to pass time. I would just smoke and play video games after work. But now I’m sick of video games. And it’s so humid outside that I don’t want to go out. And even if it was nice out, I don’t know what to do. All my hobbies require money or a car to get there which I don’t have. 

I feel extremely irritable. Like I could just snap any second. I feel like that’s one reason why I smoked too. It would calm me down and I wouldn’t get so mad or frustrated so easily. I don’t feel like eating or have motivation to anything. It hasn’t even been a day and I just feel like I can’t do this. Like I need weed to live. 

I feel as if I very dependent on it. I wake up and within 30 min I have a joint rolled and smoke it. I would smoke 3 -5 joints through the day then at night i would roll one or two. As soon as I got home from work I would take my dog out and immediately roll a joint. 

I feel like it was the only thing that helps with my anxiety. It would but all my worries on the back burner and put better and happier thoughts on the front burner. 


So how do I do this? How do I quit? How do I get the motivation to quit? How do I stop being so dependent on it. Should I just quit quit or maybe smoke weekends or something? How do I deal with my anxiety without it?",3

A week ago I spoke to my doctor about not sleeping and pretty well determined it's motivation to get up from the couch, off the internet and into bed. That not smoking would impact that. They also freaked me out about cannabinoid hyperemesis when I mentioned I frequently don't have an appetite and need to smoke to be able to eat solid food.

So I've been told to find a psychologist to speak with about marijuana addiction by end August, the referral script said psychotherapy, so not sure if it has to be a psychologist.

I managed to go two days without smoking after that but didn't get to day 3.

I've been trying to stop for years. Best I've done is a couple months a year or so ago not smoking when I worked the next day. I know this is affecting my work. I know I can do so much better. I know weed has just pulled me down throughout adulthood.


So I guess, what's something to look out for when looking to speak to someone in the mental health field for addiction?

This is the first time I’m stopping because I felt like I needed to. About two weeks ago I was in bed smoking pot but I couldn’t feel anything no matter how much I smoked and I knew I had to quit. 

The first few days of me quitting this time were easy. I read the suggestions from this  group (drink lots of water/exercise/mediation). On day three I had my first appointment with a therapist (not about pot and nor did I mention it). 

Today I feel like shit. I’m quarantining alone, I had a good relationship attempt with a former friend of mine fail a month ago, work seems to piling on me and I can’t get control of it, I’m 27 watching friends succeed/get married/buy homes and I’m living in my apartment with credit card debt that I’d be lucky to pay off within a year. I’m struggling mentally but I’m still trying. Some days life feels like a chore but I’m still trying. 

Thank you everyone for telling your stories, y’all are motivating me to push harder despite my depression which seems to be getting worse.",2

I’ve also been using mainly at weekends and holidays when I got the chance to smoke but idk I didn’t realise how it helped me cope w MI until this year really when I already became a bit too dependant on it. 

I’m taking a t break now of two weeks (nearly 4 days down wooo) and I don’t really know how to cope, I can just feel myself starting to spiral and I would normally go for a walk to try clear my head and have a j then probably meet my friends and smoke more. 

I’m off cigarettes just over a year although I will probably have one if I was excessively stressed, doesn’t usually hit it right anymore tho. I obviously do not want to be dependant on alcohol either. I feel like cbd generally doesn’t really do much, but I also don’t wanna become dependent on that either (physically not psychologically)",2

I've tapered down my usage but still can't convince myself to quit. I'm okay financially, socially and in decent shape. When I do decide to quit, I run out of things to do by 9pm or so. In the hours between 9 and when I fall asleep is usually when I decide I don't need to quit. For example, while browsing this sub at night I saw someone's dog died because of their addiction. I'm nowhere near this so stuff like that makes me feel like I'm not doing that bad. 

Before covid I would do things like go to the gym, museums, random restaurants. Now I don't have enough to do to fill my evenings and that's hindering me from being able to quit

Anybody else gone thru something similar and have advice?",3

Yesterday I celebrated 6 months without weed. I was a daily smoker from 21-27, and have been trying to quit ever since. I’m 30 now, and in January I HAD to be done with it again. I had gone 4 months without it, then relapsed at Christmas when I was home w my family. They drove me insane and after 4 days there I went and bought weed. 

I smoked for a straight month and then at the end of January, I was super depressed, nauseous every day, and wanted to crawl out of my skin. I KNEW I had to be done again and this time for good. All of the other times I wanted it to be for good too, but I could never make it past 4 months. THIS TIME I found this subreddit right then, at 4 months when my cravings were terrible. Thank GOD for you all. And for my friends and my partner who also encouraged me not to go back to it. 

I still have cravings for it, but I know without a doubt my life is better without weed. I have more energy and motivation, so much more clarity, and I am actually happy to go out and do activities (walks, runs, hikes, see new nature spots, etc). 

Thank goodness for mental clarity! 

If there’s one thing I can offer to all of you, it’s that your brain is LYING to you when it says smoking will feel good. It will for 5 mins or maybe 10, but then you’ll feel like shit again. That’s the truth for me anyways.

It's like staying in your bed all day, not changing out of your sweats, not leaving your house, or never moving out after high school. Staying in love with the same person and not moving on. Still using paper to trade stonks. Using T9 to text people. None of those things are inherently bad and they are sometimes necessary and can provide benefits. But there's a time to move forward and leave your comfort zone. Life shouldn't stay a vacuum, but it can be one for a little.

As with any comfort zone, they should be expansive in nature. Not retractive. If it can't come with you, maybe it's time to leave it behind.",13

I would smoke a bowl when I woke up, first thing. I would make coffee and then smoke another bowl and Veg out until it was time to leave for work. Then I'd smoke another bowl before I walked out the door. 

When I got home, I'd have to smoke at least two bowls before I felt I was in the right head space to play my PS4. Sometimes, towards the end, even that wouldn't do it and I'd just stare at the wall or scroll on my phone for hours until I was exhausted enough to go to bed, before which I'd smoke again. 

I didn't want to quit because I didn't think I could enjoy my favorite things without weed. I am happy to report that today I cleaned my apartment, did a load of laundry and then sat down to try to play Detroit: Become Human. I didn't think I could enjoy it, but that was three hours ago and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. More than I ever did stoned. I laughed, I got excited, I got scared, and most of all, I didn't feel like I was missing anything. At one point I even jumped for joy.

I know it's only been three days, but I don't even crave it anymore. It got between me and my video games. I don't need that noise in my life, haha.

Just wanted to share where I'm at with the jazz cabbage. I've been a consistent smoker for about 5 years or so, with gaps of a week or more every few months, ever since freshman year at college. Smoked before that in high school but not NEARLY as consistently as when I arrived at university. In April I had to move back home from my college town due to COVID related reasons. Found a dispensary close to the house that I've been able to procure weed from and have used this weed on a near daily basis. I now have to start getting clean for a language assistant position I've accepted in Spain for the next academic year. I've taken long breaks from weed before (wildly complex dynamic as I'm sure all of you can relate). However I haven't decided to QUIT quit until now. I really, really love weed. For me it acts as a warm blanket that calms me down and let's me live in another place for a couple hours. Ever since moving back home I've made a ritual out of the trip I make to the dispensary to the spot where I toke up. I told myself I would stop a few weeks ago but couldn't control myself. That's happened lots of times before. Very bad impulse problems especially with substances. Am worried about the path ahead, in terms of not being as happy or as satisfied as I was when toking.

It has been two years since I last smoked pot. Before that I had attempted to quit twice. While I have not visited this awesome community in the past year, I thought I should come back and tell you your struggles will get better with time and devotion. 

If you are a pot addict, you probably have issues to deal with. You cope with the pot--I know I did. Quitting getting high did not fix me altogether, but it was a concrete and essential step to getting better. Things get a whole lot easier when you don't spend every waking hour thinking of your next hit. Be sober, exercise, seek therapy (if you can afford it) and create a space to heal.

About four weeks ago, my partner left me. I was devastated but realized how he enabled my addiction. Cannabis is a substance I am powerless to say no to, and it has interrupted my life by getting me expelled from college, getting me involved with cps, as well as interfering with my antidepressants and making me apathetic towards any work or creative project. 

So I threw all of it away, in the dumpster, as well as any paraphernalia, wrote an old girlfriend and asked her to be my sponsor, and joined an AA group. There are also NA groups in the area but due to Covid they are only once a week on Zoom. So guess what I'll be doing on Wednesday?

I had to want sobriety. I finally want it. With my ex leaving, I finally felt free enough and strong enough to be sober. I think cannabis helps a lot of people. It does not help me. I am on day four and using the I Am Sober app to pledge every morning then review every night. 

Good luck to everyone here. Sometimes it takes relapse after relapse or a big life change, a step you don't want to take, in order to succeed. But every choice you make not to use is a success, remember that even being here and being aware of your addiction is a success. Baby steps.

I'm not white knuckling it like I have in the past, I'm ok with never smoking again. I'll always have access to weed if I want it but the want is not there. I like where my life is going now. Things are more peaceful. If you're struggling know that you can do it and there is a better way to live your life.",12

I told myself every lie under the sun to support my habit, 'it's just pot' 'you could quit if you wanted to, but why should you?'  I've wanted to quit too many times to count but everytime I got even remotely sober, my brain would trick me and tempt me until my will power bent and before I knew it, those thoughts of getting sober were swept under the rug. It may sound silly but earlier this year I discovered David Goggins and listening to someone so sure and strong made me realize how weak ive been. I put my life on hold for something I was convinced was helping me, but in reality it has been a shackle holding me back. Anyways, thats a long way of saying that now the fog is lifting and I'm realizing what a closed off jerk I've been. I have shut out family and friends in favor of getting high and doing nothing. I graduated college only to settle into a dead-end job because I knew I could get away with smoking on the clock. I dont even know who I am as a sober adult because I've never been one. I've let life pass me by in a lot of ways, but now I'm seeing personality traits I didn't know I had. My emotions are running free and it feels great to actually feel something. I don't regret a thing in life, but im ready to own up and take control.

2020-07-27 06:19:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hyppfl/daily_edible_use/,Daily Edible Use,"Hi all! 

I’m new here and I’m looking for some answers. Please feel free to speak from your experiences as well. 

I was first introduced to cannabis two years ago. Last year I got my med card which gave me much more available access to products. I don’t smoke often. I might smoke a couple grams in a month at most, but I will go months without smoking. (I Usually only smoke for instant-nausea relief, for an on-going GI issue I’ve had since pre-cannabis). 

The real issue for me is the edibles. About a year ago I began daily use of edibles, 10mg. I began daily use at night to help me sleep.

Prior to using cannabis I had terrible sleep anxiety which would keep me up especially if I needed to be up in the morning. I also have GAD and depression. 

For a while it really seemed to help me. It wasn’t until quarantine that I began to use more frequently. When I would feel down or depressed mid-day I would pop a gummy, and feel a lot better. Improved my mood, but if I wasn’t already up and doing something, I would likely be stuck to my couch for the foreseeable future. 

I’ve hit a point where I feel like I’m on a merry-go-round. With daily use, I never have trouble sleeping and my anxiety is at it’s all-time lowest. But I don’t feel like I’m “better now”, I just feel those symptoms have become a non-issue as long as I’m using cannabis. 

I’m realizing I could be ignoring the side-effects and downfall of cannabis just because of the “good” it is doing. But is it really doing any good if I’d still experience my symptoms of GAD, depression, and lack of sleep without it? 

My mental fog is HORRIBLE. I am scatter-brained and have short-term memory loss even when I am not stoned. I don’t know how my sleep is without it, because I don’t give myself the opportunity to find out. 

My drive and motivation are no longer there. Cannabis used to inspire me to create and enjoy, but it’s become a hindrance for these things. 

I’ve been working an 8-5, where I’m sober during my shift. But after I get home I usually pop a 10mg gummy within an hour or two and another before bed. 

The reason I’m writing is because I don’t think I can stop. Or...I don’t want to stop? When I think about stopping I hear the voice in my head remind me of “all the good it does” and in fear of my symptoms returning, I continue use. 

Obviously this is a problem. But where do I begin? I know CBD has helped me with a lot of my symptoms, is it appropriate to switch and stop THC use? 

I just want my mind back. I feel like a dysfunctional adult and I want my life back. 

Sorry my thoughts are so jumbled. Just have had a lot of realization after reading other posts.

I spent the whole month of June high as a kite. The worst parts of smoking for me were: severe tunnel vision, it helps with university projects but it doesn't help me discover new music/hobbies/etc; the inability to control what I eat, I get in a ""who cares?"" mindset every time I smoke; how little I like to talk to others, and how much goddamn money I was spending. Weed prices are quite expensive where I live, like £60 for a quarter ounce.  


I went from about a half ounce a week to nothing, and I've hit 3 weeks today. I'm exercising every day and losing weight; I look way better. I have had a harder time focusing on certain tasks but it's a massive net benefit overall and I know that I'm getting better. I feel normal again. I don't feel overcast 24/7. Sleeping is a bit worse, but then again, I'm not sleeping for 12 hours a day and wasting my life. Thanks to people in this community for sharing their stories and helping me do this.

still staying up super late, but i dont feel uncomfortable anymore, im considerably less irritable than 3 days ago, but im generally an irritated person, so i dont know how much of that was lack of weed - none the less today was a good mood day.  


Did something i never thought id do so easily in my life - i stood up to my bosses today, gave them an earful of my mind, and didnt lose my job.    I work in kitchens, and after having spent an incredible amount of time on an unreasonably hot line the last few days, several of us were showing signs of heat exhaustion, and the kitchen manager was scheduling most of us 7 days a week because were short staffed.      


I was hired 3 weeks ago, and my agreement was 4 or 5 days a week, 40 hours a week.   Ive been working 50+ hour weeks at another job for years, and when it went under due to covid, i decided i would stop working so much and so hard at these jobs that no one cares about to begin with, and i truly believe thats part of what was making me so depressed and thus turning to daily weed use.  


well i agreed and decided to be okay with one 7 day week.   Then this morning i got my new schedule.   all 7 days again, and the kitchen manager is scheduled just her normal shifts.    i was not kind about it, and nor do i regret being unkind about it.   These people are lazy, most of them are true junkies - But i let them have it and then walked out after telling them id be back tomorrow, i expected my schedule changed, and that they could all stew in their bullshit tonight, and then i went and applied to 5 different places just in case they decide to let me go, but i let my GM know everything that has bothered me immesely since i came in the door.  


i wasnt properly trained, i was just thrown in and expected to figure it out - same thing for learning supervisor - I flat out told them all it was literally the most unprofessional kitchen ive ever walked into - his supervisors dont give a fuck, his managers dont give a fuck and half his kitchen staff is either high, drunk, or comming down off of hard drugs almost every day.   Every day people dont show, and people beg me to stay, and that im already sick and damned tired of it - I told him id be back tomorrow and i didnt want to hear a single complaint about it.   I nearly passed out on the line yesterday from heat exhaustion, because it reaches well in excess of 100 degrees and theres no relief, no fans, nothing to help keep us cool besides water and some wet towels.    I came home, i relaxed, i slept, but im beat.  


beyond that.   I slept the best ive slept in weeks last night.    I actually felt rested when i woke up, but i can still tell my mind is adjusting because im randomly getting tired throughout the day - regardless of whether or not i lose my job tomorrow, im ready, and im proud of myself for doing something ive been so afraid of doing for so long...  


Standing up for myself.    My journey to here started with learning to assert myself, have confidence, and speak my damn mind un-apologetically.    At some point i realized that when im high, im to complacent and too avoidant of conflict.    Im currently beating that version of me into the grave and im fuckin proud of it.    my life is not work, and i will not allow it to be anymore, because it drives me to hate my situation, and to want to smoke.  


my feelings on this were validated when one of my other cooks who has been sober for two years admitted to me today that the crap that has been going on at work has been causing him to struggle immensely.    People talking about getting fucked up, doing drugs, smoking weed all the time around him is driving his former adict mind up the wall - he walked out with me today after i told him his sobriety is more important than this job.   hes on probation, and only 30 days from being done.    Im fucking proud of that too.

&#x200B;

wish me luck tomorrow.   either people are losing their jobs and the line is getting towed at my job starting tomorrow, or im walking out permanently and moving on to better things.  


today i love me, and i will do for me, and i dont remember a time when i felt that way.

I feel like I'm over the worst regarding quitting weed but I'm so fucking emotional all the time and I can't control my thoughts or concentrate at work. I temporarily moved in at my mother's place because I wasn't able to be alone in my apartment. 

I'm consumed with sadness, feeling lonely and empty. I can't really be with friends because they all smoke, so I have no one to talk to except for my mother.

Everything feels bleak and the thoughts of just smoking a joint and hang out with friends is growing rapidly, even though I know it probably won't solve anything.

I've read in other leaves posts about REM sleep and the lucid dreams coming back. Up until today, that has NOT happened (but then, last night changed that quickly)......

For me, the first 3 days were awful withdrawals (25+ year smoker). I mean, it literally felt like the flu. But that tapered off (and I was VERY upset at myself for allowing an addiction to physically affect me so harshly). Once the physical symptoms went away, this anger has made me 100% committed to never smoking again (i live in CO, and can hit the shop anytime i want, super tough when its so readily available). 

Anyways, its been depressing as everything i enjoyed stoned just isn't appealing to me. I used to gig as a musician, and now I'm not sure I'll ever even play anymore. Another story, for another time.

Back to the dreams. My sleep has not been great. Waking up very early, around 3am. Staying awake a few hours, and then going back to bed. I'll drag ass all day, nap when i can, and then get back to bed around 10pm. Rinse and repeat. I'm no sleep expert, but I'm guessing the REM sleep for me has been sporadic (to say the least).

Anyways, Day 25 (last night). I can remember a part of my dream that was so REAL, it literally had me emotional during the dream. I can't really tell you much more than I remember, but it had to do with violence, people dying and me fearing for my life and safety. I remember vividly the emotional panic I felt during the dream. And then I remember waking up this morning (6am instead of 3am), and being so very RELIEVED that it was only a dream......

So why am i sharing this. Because some of you may relate already, and some of you may experience something similar (and I'd like you to be forewarned).

Love you all, and I love this community. The tips and advice here have helped me so incredibly much.",7

It's just frustrating not being able to get out of my head so easily and having to deal with emotions after forcing myself to not deal or feel much for so long. Not sure if anyone shares that feeling/ experience but if you do, you're not alone.

At the beginning of college that year, I started to become a little depressed and anxious. I'd get random days or weeks where I'm just out of it and not wanting to do anything. Fast forward to today and I've had a few panic attacks, most from weed. The worst part is I'm nervous to hang out with some friends because how they think of me. I never hung out with girls in high school and I'm getting together with one this week and I am super anxious about it. I think marijuana could be an underlying reason. I smoked today and it gave me a small panic attack as I was already nervous about it. Im not sure if marijuana is causing this, but I feel like it has taken the fun out of a lot of things as well. I'm not hating on marijuana at all either, this is just an opinion and me asking for help, thank you.",1
2020-07-26 18:28:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hyg7yi/third_attempt_at_quitting_its_tough/,"Third attempt at quitting, it's tough....","Hey everyone, I created this throwaway account so I can maybe get some advices, tips, encouragements, or anything really.I'm a 24 years old guy and I am openly pansexual, I have been in an abusive relationship from January 2019 until September 2019 where my mom literally forced me out of my toxic lifestyle. I've been abused emotionally, psychologically and financially by a guy I met online in a MMORPG (He will be referred as Sam). He's the reason I've started doing weed, I have always avoided drugs but he found a way for me to become ""addicted"" to it. I have major depression and social anxiety that has been diagnosed 2 years ago and have been successfully dealing with ADHD since i've been 4 years old. Now that you guys know the context a little bit more, it'll be easier for me to share my thoughts, fears and struggles.

I started smoking in April 2019, and quickly enough I started smoking almost every single days for one simple reason : I was feeling alot more happy than usual, I felt like I was back to my previous self before all this depression bullshit. I was able to play video games like I used to, my head was clear of weird thoughts and I could truly focus on having a good time.I started smoking more and more due to weed not hitting me as much as before due to me getting used to it. I started missing work a lot more just to smoke and feel happy, I started spending a lot more money on weed despite me being **literally fucked financially** by Sam, he was sadly convincing me that this was the solution (Love truly is frightening sometimes).Despite all of this, I **never ever was high at my workplace**, I would always smoke after I left work as I knew being high at work is totally inadequate and could jeopardize my whole career as my domain of work is not that huge, people talk.

Fast forward to September 2019, as mentioned above, my mom forced me out as she gave me an ultimatum, either I accepted her help or she would stop helping me altogether as she saw I was sinking even further into a very toxic lifestyle led by Sam. My apartment was a total mess, it was filthy, full of dirty dishes, candy papers or whatever on the ground, awful smell of cat litter, it was a total mess. I took her offer and broke up with Sam (Which was a very painful process as he didn't want it to happen and would do all kind of things to make me feel bad to the point my mom had to buy him a one-way plane ticket so he could move the fuck out).

So the main problem was out, I was back in my hometown, Sam was gone, I could finally say ""It's all over"" and have a better life right? Not really, there was still one problem that remained that was induced by him, weed. When I went back, I stopped smoking for a month, which honestly was easy because I just didn't felt like smoking, I was just too tired. Then I stopped being tired and started smoking again and the frequency went up as time went.

Since this winter, I've been on and off on weed, I would smoke a lot but during limited times (At most maybe a week?). My first time trying to quit was at the end of December, I progressively started smoking less and less until I stopped entirely, it lasted for a good 2 months but then I was smoking again. I tried a second time around April and it lasted for maybe a month and a half? This is also when I got my new job at a place that I wanted to work at for years. I thought that this would help me quit, I would finally have a job I like again where I could be happy, I wouldn't need weed anymore right? That's what I thought during the first few weeks, and here I am today, trying to quit again.

I also had another relationship since I moved out which wasn't abusive but recently just ended due to us not sharing the same vision of the future. Which caused me to move out in the beginning of July where I decided to become someone's roommate and share a condo (Which is really comfy to be honest).

Now, I know that I talked about depression, abusive relationships, moving out and all that kind of stuff that isn't really related to smoking but I just felt it was important for me to share the context so you guys could understand where i'm coming from a lot more easily. This is when I start talking about how it's rough right now.

Right now, i'm not sad per say, but i'm not happy either, i'm just bored and think life is boring right now. Because of that, I feel the need to be high just so I can be happy even for only a few hours. I broke the promise I made to myself last year where I told myself that I would avoid impacting my work, I was high and there was an urgent meeting and it was a total mess for me, I was saying things that didn't make sense, I was almost trip talking in a work meeting. I'm mad at myself for that, I'm furious about weed being part of my life. I don't have the will to do anything if I don't smoke, I'm just sitting on my computer or laying in bed with my eyes closed thinking ""What the hell am I doing?"" without the will to do anything, I want to smoke so I can do something and feel normal.

I've been cold turkey for around 3 days now, and this is by far the most difficult attempt at this moment. My roommate is a casual smoker and has weed and hash in his stuff, I found myself stealing from his stash because mine ran out. This is not who I am, I'm realizing that I've started stealing drugs because I need to be high, I'm ashamed and this need to change.

At the end of the day, I don't want to stop smoking entirely, I like weed a lot more than alcohol, I wish I could continue if I was able to stop myself from abusing it. But I know this might be impossible, I'm impulsive and sometimes it's better for me to stop something entirely to make things better.

Sorry if I didn't make much sense, I'm really looking for advices here, I feel like I've lost my former self and became this person who need to be high to be happy, that i'm not the usual hard-working person that I've always been anymore. I want things to change and this is my first step towards actually making things better.  


Edit : After lurking this sub-reddit a bit more, I see that some people are making multiple posts about their progress. I will be doing this as I thought this would be a good way for me to keep going, it'd be a shame to announce that I relapsed you know?",4

2020-07-26 16:45:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hyeg65/how_why_i_quit_plus_my_story_long_story/,How & why I quit plus my story (long story),"Hey guys‘n‘girls! I just wanted to share my experiences with weed & quitting plus my story.

First of all, I live in Germany and cannabis (I'll call it weed) is illegal here. This does absolutely NOT mean it’s not available. Actually if you want to buy weed you will find a way to buy weed. Our politicians are talking like this market does not exist and what’s more shaming they support the legal drug alcohol as if it’s totally normal to get (absolutely) drunk or even wasted from time to time. I kinda feel like they are fooling me all the time. TV commercials for alcohol are legal here and our government doesn’t even care about it. I‘m going offtopic so let’s get back to my weed story.

When I started consuming weed I was in my late 16's and all my friends were hanging around high on playgrounds. I tried it once and I felt nothing even though my eyes were red as hell and my friends were laughing about me and pointing at me shouting ""look how high this dude is!"" But really I did not feel anything.  
This happened twice.  
But I really wanted to know why everybody was so cool with it and I wanted to be on the same level of highness. So I asked my cousin and her boyfriend to smoke as much weed with me until ""I feel something"". They rolled a joint by the time then the biggest joint I had seen so far. After we smoked that joint in her basement where her room was they both were pretty high but I didn't feel anything. Again. So I told them that I was not high and the looked at me like I was lying. But I wasn't. My cousin's boyfriend laughed a bit and rolled another big one this time only for me.  
I sat on the bed and smoked it and suddenly I had a big hit in my brain. A million thoughts were flooding my brain at once and there were some ""important things to remember"" that I forgot half a second later. I laid down and starred at the wall. I did not talk to my cousin or her boyfriend I just had a conversation with myself in my head. I can't remember how long this time high was but after I became normal again I told myself I would never ever do this again.   
It took a week until I wanted to be high again...  


Now every time I smoked weed I got stoned. And I can't really remember how much but I smoked a lot of weed at that time. I mostly was using a bong. I never really liked joints.  


When I became 17 and had my first girlfriend I stopped smoking weed with no consequences. Then I got drafted for the military for 10 months. You know the military, one part of society were it's absolutely forbidden to consume weed and if you get caught with it they will kick you out immediately. But I found some guys there who did smoke weed. And I started hanging out with them. So I was a stoner again.  
I survived the military and when I got outta there I stopped smoking weed again.  


This lasted for about a year. I found some friends who were into weed and so was I again. I even bought 3 different bongs and they all had names (""the shorty"", ""the bowl"" and ""the tower""). This went on for some years, I really can't recall how many. During that time my girlfriend broke up with me. But I found another one on the internet who was a nonsmoker and didn't even know I smoked weed.  
We started making future plans and I had these thoughts ""Is this all? Being high every day and if there's no weed trying to get weed from any source we know?"" I decided to quit smoking cigarettes and smoking weed. When I told my friends this plan they laughed about me and told me I wouldn't make it. But I did and suddenly my friends did not visit me anymore. From one day to another they just didn't visit me anymore and I became a lonely guy in a city with no friends (everybody I knew at this time was a stoner).  


So I moved to the city my new girlfriend lived in and I did not smoke weed at this time for a few years.  
When things got bad with my girlfriend I started smoking weed again (for approx a year irregularly use) when I was lonely and without her. My girlfriend did not know it and I kept it a secret. We broke up and I stopped smoking weed again.  


Then again I found a girlfriend and I wasn't a stoner at this time. But I became one again. I bought a ""kawumm"" on a Sunday and I got some weed. This was the beginning of my latest stoner career. I really didn't like the hot smoke of the ""kawaumm"" and so I bought a bong again. But this thing didn't taste good either but I wanted to be high. So I checked the internet for other ways of weed consumption.  
This was the time I read about vaporizers for the first time. So I got my first vaporizer and I liked the taste but I didn't like the cleaning process. I got another vaporizer. Good taste, easy cleaning, but it wasn't the right one for me. Next one. Also not the right one. Then I found the right one, it's the Mighty from Storz & Bickel. In the beginning I was using it without capsules. But when I found out about these capsules and the possibility to prepare them so easily I got hooked. Yep, this thing is great, but I don't want to support you consuming weed easily.   


I want to tell you why and how I quit and what happened since then.  
I have to tell you that I've been a heavy smoker for about at least 5 years. Heavy in this case means at least 1 gram per day. If I had the possibility to smoke more than 1 gram I always did. But I had made up some rules in the beginning of my stoner career. One of them was ""Do not go to work stoned!"", the German equivalent is ""kein Bier vor 4"" (""no beer before 4pm"") and I followed this rule for a long time. But when I started feeling bored at work I tried it even before work which was NEVER a good idea! You wouldn't go to work drunk, would you?! I did it a few times and I hated me for that.  
Another rule was ""don't drive stoned!"". You wouldn't drive drunk, it's just the same with weed. I never broke this rule! But I drove after 1,5 hours after consuming weed when I felt normal again in the end.  


So this went on for some time and I felt okay with it.  I had a job and we went on holidays a few times. Actually it was pretty easy for me not to smoke during the holiday but I always was looking forward to get home again to use my vaporizer. My girlfriend is so supportive she did not leave me nor did she tell me to stop vaping weed. At least for some time. In the end she told me she did not like the smell of weed and she did not want me to be high all the time, every day, 24/7. I have to tell you that she doesn't smoke weed, she just tolerated it and she's not against it. If I wasn't high all the time. I once convinced her to eat hash brownies. On a Sunday evening. Bad idea if you're planning the same. Plus I didn't know or read anything about the amount of weed that is required in food. We ate one brownie and after 20 minutes I said ""I don't feel anything"" and she didn't feel anything, too. So we ate another one. We ended up eating 4 hash brownies each and suddenly ""boom"". I looked at her and saw that she was really high. That was her first and only time she tried weed. I'm proud of her in this case.  
But I made her cry a few times because I got high when she did not want me to.  
Her words made me rethink my life, my goals and my/our future.  


And here I am now. I quit vaporizing weed 5 days ago and the craving is still there. And it's pretty tough sometimes.   
How did I manage to really quit? Actually I know some friends who have real problems with weed and one point was that I didn't want to be like them. They get up in the afternoon and the first thing they do is ripping a  DIRTY bong. I always kept my bongs clean btw.  
But that wasn't the only reason. Another reason I wanted to quit was because I just COULDN'T do it.   
There were a few times I told myself I wouldn't smoke weed today and in the morning everything was alright and I thought I wouldn't. But I always did. I always found a reason to smoke weed. Usually a bad day at work would be enough reason to smoke weed. Or boredom. Or gaming which I never did sober.   


And there will always be a reason to smoke weed (""When I started smoking weed I thought I'd do it only on special days. Little did I know every day was special"").   
My mind is so broken. There were so many times I wanted to do something and I forgot it or I just smoked weed and I didn't care anymore. I went to another room to get something or do something and forgot it. And I didn't want an addiction to control my life. I always got nervous when I ran out of weed. And sometimes when I had weed I couldn't stop to consume until it was empty. Luckily this didn't happen too often but every time you're losing your self control is one time too much, isn't it?!  


What did I do? I took all my weed stuff and put it in a box. Out of sight of course. That helped me a lot. Out of sight, out of mind! I don't want to destroy or throw away all this stuff because those are my memories and that stuff (vaporizers) wasn't cheap. My weed addiction costed a lot of money I don't want to know how much money I could have saved, it would probably make me cry.   
I also downloaded a countdown app and set a special date to quit. That also helped me. I have to admit before quitting I did another great vaping session for about a week. But when I got high this time I thought to myself ""Gosh, you cannot be high all the time!"" - I mean of course you can but is this really living? I think it's not. If you're addicted to anything, it's a waste of time (and money). I wanted to get control over my life again. I want to make music again. I want to be able to control my behavior and the times I want to smoke weed. I know I won't be sober for the rest of my life but I don't want to be high every day. So for now I am looking forward to special days when I will smoke weed again. But I gave me this promise that I won't fall back into this vicious circle again. I'm sweating a lot at night and my dreams are pretty weird but I like dreaming. When I was high every day I couldn't remember a single dream. It's like I didn't dream for years. I'm lucky I don't have sleeping problems like a lot of quitters have.  


And Yes, I am scared about my feelings. Weed helped me to kill my boredom and my feelings. But I'm on a good way now. And I will keep going this path. Mac Millers' track 2009 has some great lyrics that absolutely fit to parts of my live: ""A life ain't a life til you live it, I was digging me a hole big enough to burry my soul...""  


Wow, a long story. Don't get me wrong I still love weed. But I want to change my life and at this point weed isn't the friend it has been before. Also I'm pro legalization! You know the black market doesn't help anybody except some weird dealers (you all know weird dealers, I know that).  


Addiction is the real problem, it's not cannabis. You can get addicted to so many things.  


Stay strong and remind yourself why you wanna quit if you're struggling. The craving will get less but I think it will never stop. So you have to control yourself. You're the one who's doing everything, you are not a programmed machine, even if you think you are. If you wanna quit, quit. There will be a hard time but time will help you going through this. Another tip: get hobbies, fill the void! Get busy!

They told us all how bad drugs, including marijuana, were for us and the terrible things that they would do to our bodies and minds. We all signed the pledge but even in 5th grade, I think a lot of us knew that at least SOME of what they were saying was bullshit.

When I got to high school and started smoking pot, I started reading about marijuana activism. THEY said that the things Ranger Rich told us in those D.A.R.E. meetings about marijuana was in fact bullshit. “Marijuana is not addictive, it’s less harmful than alcohol, it’s God’s fuxking gift to man.” They told me exactly what I wanted to hear and I RAN with it for over a decade. 

Then I tried to quit. I had insane dreams, extreme GI upset, anxiety, depression, intense cravings. Holy shit! I was having actual PHYSICAL withdrawal symptoms that lasted about 3-4 weeks. Just before that, I had been laid off and spent $10k in government money on a summer long hash oil binge. It took me 8 years to graduate college because I kept failing classes. Stupid ones like gym! It sucked all my motivation to do anything but get high. I realized later, as the clarity returned, that I had lost control of my life... I was an addict!

Now, to be fair, as an addict I may have become addicted to it or another substance anyway. I can’t say it was Ranger Rich’s fault just the same as it wasn’t Jack Herrer’s fault. It wasn’t my parents’ fault either. BUT... I wish there was a more prevalent moderate message like there is for alcohol, something between the gloom-and-doom and license to chill. 

Something like: “Marijuana, like alcohol, is a relatively safe substance for most people to enjoy in moderation. However, it does run the risk of physical and mental dependency and it has a known risk of negative mental, emotional, and behavioral changes with heavy use. If you find yourself unable to moderate your usage, talk to a drug counselor about it.” 

There are a lot of folks out there who are learning the hard way because the cannabis industry in places like Denver make marijuana seem like a toy. It’s not. It’s a drug. It has risks, side effects, and potential consequences for not treating it with respect. It was something I had to internalize to really appreciate that it was never going to be for me. Because no matter how hard I tried, I could never treat it with the respect it deserves.",14

Without getting into everything, I’ve had some stuff I’ve tried really hard to work on solo for a long time. It hasn’t been working, but I got into a rut of just trying harder to fix it myself and getting tunnel vision that “if I just do this one thing different / try a little harder it’ll work”. Yesterday a lot of stuff went wrong, and I had a pretty big breakdown, but opened up about what Ive been going thru to some important people in my life and ... holy crap it felt so good. I realized there’s a lot more I’d been repressing and have been struggling a lot more than I’d even realized. I was heard, they cared, and things actually felt like they could get better. I realized, for me at least, that weed isn’t the whole problem - there’s other stuff going on, weed is definitely making it worse and something I need to cut out to get better, but there’s more work than just that to be done. Finding a therapist, getting help, and feel like I don’t have to shoulder all of it alone. 

So I say all that to say ... if something isn’t feeling right, reach out to someone, anyone. Talk about it. It can be scary and I know it can feel sometimes like some part of you doesn’t work right. But other people will help if you ask. I used to see stuff like this all the time but say “nah, I can do it myself”, but holy crap its so much easier if you just ask for help.

I am in a vicious cycle of wanting to quit but then not having any and immediately feel the dissociation and anxiety kick in. The longer I'm sober the harsher dissociation swings and anxiety knocks. Then depression, doing anything is joyless. But being stoned is just as joyless while I'm stoned. 

Flip flop between wanting to quit and being sure to not remembering how awful I feel high. When I cant scrape any more metal that has a remnant of weed dust to even pretend to be high. 

Can't even stomach a video game and I have a really nutty PC. Rtx 2080ti, 3900x gen4 NVM:e SSD, and even with that and a 1440 Gsync monitor I feel nothing. No matter the game or settings I click around for a few minutes and turn it off and I'm back to thinking of weed.  The number of times I've thought of selling this so I can buy 15-20 ounces with the money and not worry about weed for a month or two as ill have 20 ounces! 

This post is just rambling at this point probably incoherent and littered with mistakes or inconsistencies but that's what I am. 

I want to quit now, stoned. I only have 1 more spliff or 2 and I'm completely out. I can maybe beg the money but then I need to travel an hours bus ride or ask my dad for a 30-minute awkward hellish drug buy with my dad, I'm relying on him to take me always now as my girlfriend refuses too and my anxiety is off the scale so much that having to get the bus with COVID and just people makes it so ill suffer horrific withdrawal until I'm desperate enough to beg my dad to take me and he hates it. I know he does. 

I just can't quit. I have had multiple, like 50 or more 5-18 days where the dissociation, anxiety and depression just become my entire being and I don't wanna wake up in the mornings. And I smoke and i instantly regret it. 

5 years of smoking. 

1 year where it was not abused, and recreational. Now and again.

2 years of it becoming all-consuming. 

2 years of me hitting multiple weeks without to relapse. I now smoke an eighth per day and a half. 

I feel like I can't ever beat this, I speak weekly to a drug councillor who's really helpful but only been talking to him for 2 weeks and he's telling me it sounds like hell but it's my normal, i have not felt not depressed or anxious in consecutive years at this point 

I feel like at least getting the addiction under control will help me fight the other mental challenges I need too, but with it. I can't even begin day 1 without absolutely panicking and becoming erratic and more and more desperate to re-up
 
Sorry. Guess I just don't have anyone who I feel I can relate too, i feel I got the extreme end of weed addiction stick. The dissociation that is all-consuming and never-ending is the worst of it all though.",14

Decided to quit because it was something that I always needed. Whether I was going out, doing activity, wake up smoke and go to bed smoke. I was smoking about 2g a day. Since stopping, I have noticed my memory is better and my anxiety is down. I always thought weed was helping with my anxiety but now feel that it was doing the opposite. I wish I could be one of those people that can use in moderation but unfortunately if I do it once I will go right back to Full on. This decision has to be made by you for you in order to truly stop. This support group is incredible and I am so happy to be able to come and read the posts, like, and comment. We are all in this together and the amount of $ we are saving is shocking!

I am on Day 5 of quitting and the physical withdrawals aren't too bad although I have some problems sleeping. I am also getting cravings every night and I've come close to relapsing twice so far but have managed to fight these urges. Since these cravings are getting stronger though I have decided to go away for a week to a Caravan in the middle of nowhere for a week of hiking, cycling and a few beers in the evenings. 

With being so far from home I won't have access to any Weed so cravings or not I won't be able to relapse. Being outdoors all day and all the exercise I am going to get should really help purge the THC out of my body and clear my head also. I leave on the 1st of August so I've just got to keep myself busy and resist cravings until then. 

Wish me luck.",8

I feel fine without it and it honestly hasn’t been that hard for me to get to this point, but it is currently 3am and I’m having trouble sleeping. Nighttime is usually the only time when I think about it because I’ve grown accustomed to my nightly before-bed smoking rituals. It’s the nights where I’m just laying in bed trying to fall asleep where I find myself thinking about how 25 days ago I’d have gotten up out of bed to take one more rip to put myself to sleep. I don’t miss it enough to follow through with the act and for that I am already proud of myself. I know if I did, I would immediately regret it. 

I’m so close to my first month sober from smoking. I hope to keep my willpower strong and add many more months after that. Eventually years. I’m ready to change and experience the changes that come with it.

Feeling terrible but determined.,"This is at least the 10th time I’ve quit this year. However, this time feels different. The last few times I quit I had a huge issue not sleeping (I need at least 8-9 hours a night or the voices in my head get loud and violent). I would end up caving every time because of the sleep thing. At that time I was drinking caffeine daily. This time I made sure to quit caffeine a full week before I tried quitting weed again. Because of this, I can actually sleep at night without weed. The other thing I did was pray to God constantly to make this time a lot less painful than all those other times.

I was a 12-year VERY HEAVY smoker (at least an eighth a day plus pens). I suffer from many mental illnesses, including PTSD. I have a ton of awful memories that pop up constantly, and I cry randomly all the time (it sucks). What I wish I could do is erase these memories. Instead I would smoke, because it helped numb the pain and usually stopped the tears, until it couldn’t anymore.

I just cannot afford to smoke weed right now. I would spend over $200 a week on it, many times spending my last dollar for it. It’s annoying. And it’s just not doing what it used to do anymore re: the PTSD. Plus, it makes me fat and lazy.

Finally, and most importantly, I need to get rich QUICK. I’m so fucking sick of worrying about money, and I need the motivation and 100% brainpower to achieve this. Rich people are not fat, lazy weed smokers. I believe that God will not allow me to get rich unless I give this up first. Sacrifice for reward and whatnot.


The first 4 days were truly hell, with repressed memories coming back. I felt highly suicidal until day 5. I went back to the gym on Day 2 for the first time in a year, to help get my emotions under control. It didn’t work as good as I hoped it would, but I will continue to work out and hope things change mentally. Rich people work out all the time, so that’s what I must do too.

For some reason I still feel high, which makes me thrilled. I truly believe God has done this to me as a gift so I don’t cave. I’m tired a lot (much preferred over not sleeping) and I am not so motivated yet. I’m hoping this changes in a few more weeks. Can any former longtime heavy smokers chime in with their timelines. I need some motivation. Thank you for reading",3

* Seeing psychologist every 1-2 weeks

Long story short: I’ve smoked weed almost daily since I was 13, developed PTSD/CPTSD over the years from a horrible childhood (and probably in part due to marijuana, fml), and now I’m 25, almost 26. I quit for about 2 years around the ages of 21-23 (but sadly picked up drinking instead...). Then I made the mistake of smoking again and it turned into a daily habit quickly.

I have goals, dreams, so much potential - I don’t want to live like I do when I smoke; dissociated to the extreme. I’m over it. I thought I could live and succeed with weed, since so many people around me have, but because of my mental health I now accept that I can’t.

I’m 3 weeks in without almost anything - all I’ve had was a tiny herbal vape bowl when I had terrible PMS cramps that medication didn’t help (yay for being a woman, who doesn’t even want kids... hopefully I can deal with this part of me better next round).

Anyways, the problem I am running into is surprising. I thought I’d have more energy after stopping, but instead, I’m *completely fucking exhausted* every single day. I work from home and have to nap at lunch. I get 8hrs+ of sleep. I am pretty physically active, I love hiking, but exhaustion was never an issue before.

I figure it’s PAWS, but PTSD probably makes it a little more difficult for me - I’m depressed and anxious as a baseline. FWIW, I am seeing a counsellor but haven’t spoken to her about my marijuana use yet (she always says “it’s so amazing that you haven’t gotten into drinking and drugging given your past” - trust me, she’s pretty cool otherwise).

I want to be able to put time into learning programming/design - in fact, I kind of need to because I have a great opportunity coming up in a month or two, but I need to prove I can do it with a portfolio which is nonexistent right now. I have so much drive, fuck I could design and create a website no problem even when I was a kid, but because I literally can’t keep my eyes open to do anything, I feel fucked.

I’ve looked into PAWS a bit on this sub and people say it can take months sometimes to feel more energized. I don’t have months, I need the energy now.

I admit my diet is shit and I could use better sleep hygiene. Does anyone have any tips surrounding this exhaustion, particularly with food/bedtime routine/etc. - anything besides just waiting things out? Thanks in advance.

TL:DR; PTSD makes PAWS symptoms even worse and I really don’t have time to wait out the exhaustion. Any tips around things I can do now (eg. food, sleeping habits, etc.) to feel more energized?

P.S. as a side note, my overall cognitive abilities seem to be improving almost daily still so I’m happy about that at least. I just need my energy back.",3

 Well it just became enough, I had the chance to take control of something in my life for once in the midst of all the chaos. One month just went by and I didn't even notice because the parts of life that weed had replaced are coming back in to fill the space that my addiction had taken. The first few days are definitely the hardest, meditation was hugely helpful. Then it just became a matter of replacing old habits. $150 saved so far, sleeping better, working out more, eating healthier, spending more quality time with my dog and hobbies, and being able to wake up without being groggy for half the day, only thinking about the next bowl.

I was with two friends who smoked all the time, I would always say no, and eventually I just started smoking. The rest is history.

But pretty much nowadays I use to go months without it, here and there id smoke then at uni I’d smoke constantly. I wasn’t with my hometown best friends during that time however.

I’m graduating in December with a degree and rife opportunities ahead for my future, and I know I should stop smoking. I have such a beautiful glass piece in my room that just begs to be used everytime I look at it. But if I don’t stop smoking atleast in the next year or so my chances at landing a decent career is gonna be slim.

How do I do this with my friends? They’re always smoking, seriously. It’s everyday with them, every point during the day, and I feel like I’m wasting time just smoking. I don’t even get leg twitchingly high anymore because my tolerance is so high. 
I exercise everyday, and I’ve been doing it for so long, I just wanna smoke a fat J after a workout but I get so incredibly lazy and unproductive. When I’m with my friends I can be myself, be happy, laugh hard. 

One of them will text me atleast once a day. Always asking to throw in for bud or ask me to get some or vice versa. I’ll ALWAYS end up trying to squeeze time in to hangout in a smoke session even if I made plans with others. I’ve ruined so many family related events because I’d be the stoned kid coming late and smelling terrible. Also, my memory is terrible from smoking. It really sucks.


If I cut my friends off I’m gonna be alienated from everyone. For reference, I did not grow up in a regular middle class town, I’m from the hood. And if you know your culture, smoking bud is a pretty common sight. Out of all my hometown friends, I’m the only one to get a degree at a university.

I first smoked cannabis at the age of 13 and began smoking daily at 16. I'm now 20 years old. I've tried to quit several times, with past success up to I believe 3 months. Before quarantine started I was a month sober, and I'm sure you can imagine what happened. Sometime before quarantine my roomate had introduced me to chops, which are bowls of weed and tobacco. This was something I'd heard about in the past and had always looked down on. The first time I tried it I thought it was alright but didn't try it again for a while. Then during quarantine I went absolutely nuts. I would sometimes smoke 5 very large chops right before work (I worked at a grocery store), almost to the point of passing out from the head rush. I would also do this on my lunch break and after work. It got to the point where I would refuse to smoke a bowl without tobacco on it because it wasn't the same. I started to noticed that I would wheeze at night when I was trying to sleep. I also started to experience some very strange stomach pains. Fortunately these symptoms were eventually enough to scare me away from chops. Its been 4 days since my last chop as I relapsed after about a week. Im still feeling very cloudy from the weed withdrawals, but I do not miss the chops. They were killing me. 

To anyone out there with this issue I want you to know it's possible to realize that the 7 seconds of pleasure that a chop provides is not worth sacrificing your health for.

**Age 24** \- I realized that my depression and anxiety were getting out of hand. I couldn't be myself in public situations. I couldn't relate to what anyone was saying. I was afraid to speak my mind out of fear that my ego would get hurt or embarrassed. I discovered that weed must be the cause because I never had an anxiety disorder before weed. 

**Age 24 1/2 -** Quit weed for the first time. Lasted about 8 days. Went back to it for a few months because I convinced myself that maybe I'm just a pussy and it's not weed. 

**Few months before turning 25 - March 2019 - I decide to quit** \- Lasted 42 days. Worst 42 days of my life. I was way more anxious and super depressed about the life I was living. I went to a concert, my friend offered me a hit of her vape, I smoked and basically went back to daily smoking.

**May 1, 2019 - September 9, 2019 -** Smoked on and off. Began to spend time with my sober self more but still had a strong attachment to weed.

**September 9 - November 30** \- Longest streak without weed. Spent most of these days depressed and waiting for the weed to get out of my system. I still had trouble with anxiety and social settings and just being able to be myself. This was a pretty dark period as I started looking for other substances to take the place of my weed habit. 

**December 1 - May 14 2020-** These dates were very much like May 1,- Sept 2019. I smoked on and off. In January, a girl I thought I was going to marry ended that idea. She told me she was talking to someone else and it crushed me. Ended up just reverting back to my old ways. I started drinking way more and felt like the biggest loser ever. I was also an anxious mess. I couldn't stop overthinking every little situation.

**May 15th, 2020** \- I decided that I needed to get my shit together. I knew weed was the main culprit as to why i haven't done anything with my life. Why I didn't believe in myself. Why i remained at the same comfortable job for almost 4 years when I have a degree and the ability to do so much more. Why most of my relationships were failing. Why I couldn't be myself or speak my mind. I also realized that i wasn't smoking to get high anymore. I was smoking to escape and I knew there were underlying problems and issues I didn't want to face. So I chose the easiest route and ran. I knew it wasn't going to be easy but I told myself that I'd start to taper off. 

**May 15 - June 28 2020** \- I only smoked on the weekends. M-F were days that I spent with my sober self. At first it was hard as I started to drink more during the week but after awhile, that faded too. I started to meditate every day. 

**June 29, - Current -** Meditation has helped me remain sober from weed immensely. I also find that it might be one of the reasons why my anxiety is almost completely gone. But i also believe that just abstaining from weed has played a huge role in diminishing my anxiety. I feel so calm and peaceful. See when i was smoking daily, it was literally an everyday battle trying to fight my intrusive thoughts. Now, with the help of meditation, I'm able to recognize those thoughts early on and cut them out. The mind does what the mind does. It's going to think. For some reason, we become attached to negative thinking patterns way more than positive ones. We have this idea that human beings should be perfect and we cannot fuck up. So we constantly criticize ourselves when we do. And our mind is always trying to find justification for those fuck ups instead of just recognizing that we are human beings.

 I spent 4-5 years in a constant state of fear. Weed did not help at all with that as all it did for me was amplify that fear. Quitting weed has helped me identify those shitty thoughts and got me to understand that those thoughts don't define me. 

I know it's only 27 days but I've been trying to quit for so long that I know this is the final time. I wish you all the best of luck. I've been trying to quit for two and a half years. Never stop trying if it's really what you want for yourself. Addiction is a bitch.",29

Things I've learned:

1. Wanting to quit is not the same as being ready to quit.  This is why it can take many attempts.

2. Being really ready to quit means you will take all the necessary steps to make the change permanent.  Things such as:
a.  getting rid of all things associated with weed, 
b.  joining a marijuana anonymous group, 
c.  getting therapy if able, 
d.  talking it over with family and doctor for support, assistanceand accountability, 
e. eliminating any rituals that involve weed, 
f.  replacing weed rituals with healthy new habits,
g.   learning that there are good and bad days, and understanding that that's ok,
h.  getting some support by reaching out if you are feeling like you are headed for a relapse,
i.  making a personal commitment each day to not use weed that day,
j.  meditation and yoga for slowing the mind down and stretching the body,
k.  using mindfulness continuously to self check and be in the moment,
l.  recognizing and allowing negative emotions to be rather than stuffing them or denying them, 
m.  tell someone how you are feeling regularly, or write it down and reflect on it.


Before, when I felt I wanted to quit but looking back probably wasn't ready to, I skipped or just didn't know about many of these steps, or was resisting some of these steps.  I was so frustrated. 

 I'm really happy to say I am embracing them all now.  I feel so much better about my life and more positive about my progress and my future.  I don't need weed as a crutch anymore because I now have learned the skills I need to manage my life in a healthy way.",11
2020-07-25 15:57:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hxt3rk/wake_up_call/,Wake Up Call,"Hello Reddit, I rarely use ye anymore, but I’m starting a new account just to share my story. It’s nothing spectacular (in fact quite the opposite), yet I think it’s well placed here. A little background: I’m 20/M

I’ve been smoking weed every day just about for the past few years, down here in SoCal it was as common as anything else in highschool, I started right before senior year. Throughout the first year of this (2017ish) I was a boxer, I priced myself In my perfect diet and the ability to fight at 108lbs that I could drop like a phone call, I was a singer (still am) with a bass voice that I prided myself in.
Every year, those positive pillars of my life have been chipped away by this disgusting habit.
My lungs hurt, I don’t box anymore (Did for years, I stopped more due to other health reasons, not a lack of motivation), I eat my first meal at 3-4pm nowadays and finish my nights off with Coca Cola, candy, and red meats at 3-4am...

Last night I took a large dose of an edible while being extremely tired and woozy, I’ve just endured two tragic deaths in my immediate family and have been on edge, not sleeping more than 5 hours every night for this past month. I said I wanted to have fun last night, an edible was the choice since my lungs were tired.

As the edible began to kick in, I had a genius idea deciding to take a look at my esophagus. I noticed it was very dark and unhealthy, very red and worn, I listened to my Tom Waits esq rasp and I got depressed. It made me shake with sadness, and as usual like every night I was gasping for air, only after half an hour or so the shaking didn’t stop, this wasn’t my usual bad trip that I’ve had before..
Every major artery in my body was pounding and my heart was almost 3x as fast as it should’ve been
I couldn’t lay or sit down without my limbs jolting every which way, and when I was standing I had to switch legs due to the jitters. I felt hot but was shivering, and called my girlfriend.
Even though I felt fine after a few hours and I feel okay but weak today, I don’t know what happened to me, and I’ve come to realize that this cartoonish lifestyle can only be upheld for so long. I barbecue over 3 times a week,  eat red meat like crazy, I smoke weed every fucking day and sleep 3-5 hours a night, I went from running 12 miles a day (4 in the morning, 8 in the evening), to sitting on my ass all day long, the recent societal circumstances give me that ability to sit and home and do this nowadays, and it’s no good.

I had a long, open and honest phone call with my s/o last night, she didn’t ask or convince me to change my behaviors in any way, but I concluded that I need to quit smoking weed and start exercising correctly again. Few tell you of the long term damage of smoking weed. I stayed motivated (I still do a ton of hobbies, crafts, reading, writing music, etc..), but the physical toll forces you to change your daily habits. 
Has anyone else been where I’ve been? I never feel an urgency quite so much as this to quit a lifestyle choice.",4
2020-07-25 15:34:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hxspuq/i_realized_if_i_dont_own_my_addiction_it_will_own/,"I realized if I don't own my addiction, it will own me","Day 14 after 18 years daily habit. I talked to my manager (video conf.) yesterday after messaging him about my quitting weed and confessing that it had been affecting my work. As he put it, I was ""brutally honest"" and he gave me a lot of respect and support for that. It felt really empowering. As a result, this thought came to mind: **if I don't own my addiction, it will own me**.

Of course there is a real physiological aspect to my addiction withdrawal and it really sucks - the mood swings, depression, feelings of helplessness, restlessness, heavy fatigue and all the rest is very real. But whether or not I beat this, as I see it, is a psychological matter more so than physiological. How I choose to view my addiction is something that I *can* control and it's taken me a long time to really recognize and own up to that. I can choose to buy into all the excuses I make and let them control me or I can choose to really fess up and own what I've done to myself and own my recovery.

For me, ""owning"" my addiction means:

* **No longer making excuses that disempower me or allow me to 'pass the buck'; excuses like:** ""I'm a high-functioning stoner"", ""It doesn't really impair me"", ""I need it for mental health and coping"", ""I can't quit now with the world the way it is"", ""I'll quit tomorrow"", ""I'll quit when I run out"", ""I don't want to waste my stash, it was expensive"", ""I'll lose all my weed friends"", ""It's too late to quit"", ""It's this other person's fault I smoke""
* **Owning the downsides of my addiction:** ""I ignore my problems when I'm stoned"", ""I ignore unpleasant and uncomfortable emotions and as a result can't handle them"", ""I ignore the people I love and who love me"", ""I don't engage with life"", ""I'm lazy"", ""I don't eat well"", ""I overeat"", ""I don't take care of myself"", ""I don't love myself"", ""I wasted my (first) opportunity for a meaningful college education"", ""I don't do well at work"", ""I'm negligent"", ""I don't take care of others as well as I could"", ""I don't function as well as I could"", ""I'm not living up to my real potential""
* **Owning my recovery:** ""I know I have a problem"", ""I know this affects me negatively"", ""I know I can do better"", ""I know life is worth the effort"", telling the people I love, apologizing to the people I've hurt, ""I know I'm not alone"", ""I know I need help"", seeking the help I need and not making excuses not to, admitting to myself what it's cost but using that as motivation to improve rather than dwelling in self-pity, telling the people I need to tell, throwing out my stash, throwing out my dealers number, throwing out my paraphernalia, cleaning up my nasty resin-caked smoke spot, owning my relapses and re-doubling my effort, taking care of myself, eating well, eating the right amount, getting myself out for a dang walk, getting some sunshine, doing things I enjoy, appreciating the little things, not wasting my life, pursuing meditation and yoga, learning ways to ease my recovery and implementing them, not wasting my potential, not giving up on my dreams

I got myself into this and, if I'm willing to own all the crap I've done to myself and others, I can get myself out. (Of course this doesn't mean I don't need support - it's essential! That's why I LOVE this community!) I'm well worth the effort (and you are too!) even if I don't feel that way most of the time, even if I've never really felt that way very strongly. My life is worth the effort - I am life and I shouldn't throw me away.

I got this! (And so do you if that's what you choose!)",7

Lost 3 jobs in the past 2 years because of it, and after spending time in a hospital due to suicidal thoughts I finally managed to break out of the cycle.

The past few months away from weed haven't solved all my problems, I'm still depressed and anxious, but it's definitely been an improvement since quitting as I don't have the guilt and I can actually have a routine in the day now.

Today I was cleaning out my car, and I found an old tub which I got from a friend, opened it up and... fuck, there was a little nugget of weed still left in it.

Now I know the right thing to do would be to throw it into the bin and forget about it. Barely even thinking about it though I took it and hid it in my room.

All the cravings have come back, I'm already in the back of my mind planning on when I'm going to smoke it.

I can't believe I'm back at square on again, I know I've not got the willpower to throw it out, so I'll definitely end up smoking it, fuck I just hope I don't end up buying more after this. Fuck.",10

I have done so in the past and miss being completely sober and not having to rely on weed. In my experience when I'm quitting and going through withdrawal. The withdrawal feels like all of the negative effects of weed without any of the positive. For example I'm heavy, demotivated, a little depressed, tired. It's like I woke up the day after I had a really strong edible and don't want to do anything.

I've cut back slowly and now am on day 4 of being sober. 

I'm just wondering if any of you have a similar experience? Or what your experience of quitting has been like? When I quit cold turkey a long time ago it was much worse than the gradual method I did this time.(this isn't a tolerance break, I am quitting fyi)

I had read books while smoking before, but not that many in recent years. While still smoking I bought American Gods, because I'm a sucker for any Hugo award winning novel.

At the time I blamed it on being the authors preferred text with too many extra words added. Well I just picked up the book again and the difference is amazing, and man was I wrong. At first I tried to find where I left off, but then I thought ""screw it"" and started over. I remembered only the skeleton of what I read before, and this time I really got to the meat of it. Within two and a half days I've read far past where I read before, at least half the book, and seldom do I get distracted mid page and have to re-read paragraphs to get back into it.

So i usually post on my other account but posting here today.

Its been 2 months today since i decided to quit. Its been very challenging for me i wont lie. The worse part has been the depressed feeling and increased anxiety and my exacerbated OCD. I think weed helped me by numbing myself to all my mental health issues. Without it i have to face everything sober. It sucks. I crave weed almost every day lately and find it hard to continue. I think because ive smoked so much for so long (18 years every day) that my dopamine receptors need to get use to the normal amount. 

For what its worth ive also quit watching porn aswell as social media. 2 other highly addictive and dopamine surges. 

I dont feel better than when i was smoking. But im persevering in hopes i will.

2020-07-25 10:15:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hxneg6/if_you_fall_get_back_up/,If you fall get back up,"Hi everyone we hope your weekend is going well! Just wanted to share our story with weed and life, hopefully to inspire some confidence in those who need it.

My husband and I have been together for almost ten years and throughout it all have been more or less constantly smoking up, with only a year break in between due to not being able to smoke because of living restrictions. Just like I'm sure alot of you it started really fun, wake and bake and get high to laugh at funny shows and videos games, use it to relax etc.

We've encountered many difficult times in our lives, whether it be the oppression of family, negative and toxic friends, losing out on job promotions or experiencing discrimination. All these things unfortunately happen to many and the best of people, but the constant throughout it all was good or bad, happy or sad, we used weed to enhance our joy and numb our pain. Our abuse worsened over the years culminating with very frequent hitting of an extremely potent shatter pen. Quitting weed is very difficult even for the best of people, but that extract was pure hell. The withdrawals were so intense we were experiencing the rampant emotions, horrible stomach pains, nearly no sleep, all the worst of it, all while still smoking green.

Even after quitting the high thc shatter and weaning down to weaker bud the reliance on it for peace and disconnect hadn't changed. We wished for a better life and positive change, all while stuck in the same get high over and over, binge on half a day's worth of food right before bed, and spend the next day nauseous and miserable only to repeat the same cycle. We have had at least a dozen failed attempts at quitting over the last couple years, not to mention the many other times before that.

There was the one period of a year clean, and we both were feeling fantastic again. But as many of us fall prey to we decided to experiment again, hence the shatter pen, and while the initial phase was positive, it quickly spiraled into abuse and dependency. Even though we eventually kicked that as mentioned, we continued to rely on bud to make life seem worth it, manageable, and a way to cope with, or in reality ignore, our emotions and feelings. The legalization of weed in Canada added another level, having convenient, wide selection pot at our fingertips. 

At last, after 3 failed attempts in 2020 alone, we have finally put our foot down. We're now on day 5, and without a doubt this is the time. Covid and being in our 30s, not to mention the ever growing feeling of disappointment each day we succumbed to green, hit hard and hit home. For the sake of our mental, physical, and emotional health it's time to leave it in the past.

That's the story and here's the encouragement. You are strong. You are worth a happy and positive life. You are also human. It's human to fail, to doubt yourself, and to fall trap to things which give you a moment of sanity, even if they hurt you. Our acceptance of our failures ultimately led to our success, knowing that we've grown and matured as people and a couple, and letting go of the guilt and shame of dependency and failure.

It's hard. It's really hard. Every time something hits the fan of course the first thought is I want to hit it. It's the conditioned psychology. But we are the masters of our mind, our resolve is stronger than the dark voice calling you back. And it can be for you too. Merely knowing you have a problem shows the strength you need to move on, and a better version of yourself is waiting.

Cut yourself some slack everyone. The past is in the past, and the future is yours. The only way forward is to love yourself, and you are all worth it. 🍀💚",19

Well two weeks ago I got grilled over stupid mistakes I usually mever make and today, got grilled about it again and was even threatened to be sacked. I'm forgetful, can't string together sentences to save my life due to my stutter getting worse. My manager told me ""you're not the same person as when you started"" and it hit me like a truck. I wanted to quit right then and there because I was ashamed of the person I'm turning back into. What's changed? I've been smoking up every night again to sleep and forget my problems. I stopped reading and learning in my spare time like I used to and instead of gyming 5x a week I'm struggling to hit 2. 
Using weed as a crutch is fine every now and then but I have a fucking problem. Even writing this I'm losing my train of thought. 
Long story short, I'm throwing everything out tonight and starting fresh again. I did it once, I can do it again.

Edit: got home and drowned my grinder with the last bit of bud I had in there",38

At the start of quarantine, I was able to quit for 2 weeks, relapsed for 2 months, and then quit again for 2 weeks. Now I have been back to sucking back cartridges and being zombified all day for the past 2 weeks once again. 
The first time I quit was back in April. Despite horrible withdrawal symptoms, I LOVED the feeling of being sober and crave that clarity and confidence that came with it to this day. 
4/20 came around and just like that I was smoking all day every day until July 3rd when I decided to quit again. 
I recently got a new puppy and I really want to be as present as possible during this demanding time of his life, so I quit again for 2 weeks. However, I let my friend convince me to slip with the justification of taking a “break” from my puppy parenthood. 
But I KNOW I simply just can’t have a casual relationship with weed. Every time I come back to it, I fall back into an incredibly addictive hole and lose sight of all of the amazing progress I was making sober. 
Not to mention I have zero professional motivation while using weed and become a shell of myself. I barely have the energy to do anything these days outside of caring for my puppy, so literally why do I even bother getting high if it just debilitates me more. 
Third time’s a charm I guess? Will withdrawals be less severe considering I have already gone through the cold turkey withdrawals relatively recently?",4

Frame of mind matters so much.,"Just wanna say that I barely miss weed at all. When I feel low it's not that low, and I can deal with my problems and feelings now instead of just pushing them back with weed.

It has been a frame of mind shift for me. Instead of 'I need weed to feel good', its 'I can feel good on my own, but if I don't, I'll get through it with some time"". Took me years and dozens of quit attempts to finally realize this. (been smoking for 12 years daily except for vacations when I couldnt find it).

I also watched a doc on the fentanyl crisis, and one guy said about his addiction ""If you say to yourself 'this little pill will make me feel good', then it is very hard to stop using that pill"". And it's the same with weed. I told myself ""Using weed makes me feel good when I fee bad"", and it just cements the idea in your mind that you need weed to feel good, but it's not true.

Before they legalized coast to coast in Canada (October 17, 2018), I had cut off my only dealer, threw out an eighth, threw out 3 pipes, 3 lighters, and completely abstained for eight months.

When they legalized, I was one of the first 60 people in line. 21 months after legalization, I have gone to the Addictions foundation here for a month class, and started SMART recovery a while back. Since they legalized, it's been tough for me to stay away from dispensaries open 10-10 almost every day. In 21 months, the longest I've gone without is 28 days. I've taken 14, 21-28 day breaks, but then I come back and the cycle of self-loathing brings me back.

Today is day 2. I want to continue to work out, drink a lot of water, abstain, and get this shit out of my system. There was a lot of stress that lead me to use a lot in the last six weeks. To be honest, in the last 21 months I've probably spent about $6500 on weed and accessories. I want to socialize more, meet new people, and stop making my mental illnesses and anxiety worse with weed. I'm motivated to stop. I realize all the negatives that would cease to exist without my weed addiction. I want out. I came up with a ""salesman's receipt"" of the complete consequences of using for 7 days, and it's not pretty.

Right now, I want to beat my old record and see how long I can last with sober living. I'm glad I have my SMART recovery resources and meetings, as well as this forum! I see too many negative consequences and want to change my life.",3

Although it might have had something to do with my department being a joke. I was using wax and would discreetly get high anywhere I could. On a normal weekday I would try to be sober until 12pm, but often it would be the first thing I did after getting out of bed.

After I quit College(for social reasons associated with my addiction) I was working full time. I rarely went to work stoned but it was the first thing I did when I got home. It would consume my thoughts whenever I was sober. When I finally quit I lost 10lbs in 2 weeks(6'0"" tall & 140lbs) and couldn't sleep more than 4-6 hours a night. Even after I was sober it was really hard to throw out the growing plant in my closet.

In some ways I feel better than I did a few months ago when I was using, but in many ways I am still the same.

I cannot stress enough how lonely I am. I have recently been thinking about smoking again. Marijuana has a good chance of getting legalized for recreational purchase in my state by January 2021. Having easy access to it scares me. The idea of smoking a joint is highly appealing. I want it. I want it a lot. Especially right now, but I dont have easy access.

I'm a loser when I'm sober so why does it matter if I smoke one bowl? Nothing has really changed so why do I keep stopping myself?",41

And sure, I had large problems that would be caused by cannabis. I would smoke weed every day after class instead of studying and doing homework -- big surprise, I ended up failing classes. I smoked cannabis daily.

At some point, I threw out my vapcap and decided to start fresh. To be honest, the only thing that's gotten me through 21 days is picking up a nicotine habit through vaping. This is not condoning this practice -- it's very stupid, and I do not recommend it to anyone. But it's probably the only reason I haven't given in yet.

But since stopping cannabis, I haven't yet found the magic motivation to start doing things that I thought being dull-brained and stoned all the time stopped me from doing. Keeping my space clean, exercising, sitting down to study or learn things that I want to learn -- I thought quitting would give me the magical surge of energy to begin doing these things, and obviously it hasn't. It can't do that. It can only give me time back that I would normally spend high, just now I spend that time on other addictions -- mainly those that are digital in nature.

I think my digital addictions might be more severe than my cannabis consumption. Spending hours in bed on my phone, taking it into the bathroom and spending half an hour in the shower just letting the water hit my back because I'm still on my phone. I can't go anywhere without listening to a podcast, I even shudder at the thought of doing a chore like laundry or lawn mowing without earbuds in my ears. I spend loads of time on the internet, on reddit, playing video games, etc etc.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that while cannabis was certainly a detriment on my life, I'm starting to realize that there's a lot of other problems that the cannabis simply helped me ignore. And that is honestly very discouraging, if a little obvious.",20
2020-07-23 22:49:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hwtsvw/crying_as_i_write_this/,Crying as I write this,"The day has come for me. I've been addicted for too long. For the past 5 years I can count the sober days with just my fingers and toes. I never really thought of my habit as problematic. I'm 21 now, going into my final year of college. I just want to be free from the grasp that weed has on me. I just want to have my brain back. I wasn't aware the last few years but I am definitely struggling with depression. I don't have nice thoughts when I'm sober. I don't know what else there is to a life without being high. All I can think about is how it has allowed me to shut out my family even though that is not how I would want to act. I wouldn't even look my sister in the face the last time she came home to visit... 

I guess I'm just writing this because I never thought it would be me. Please, young people, do not start smoking weed in high school. I never did it because I thought it was cool. I enjoyed the way it made me feel. Now I know that feeling is just the numbness from reality. That might've been okay if that's where it stopped but during my 11th grade year dabs started to become popular. I still remember the first dab I ever took. 4/20 of my junior year in high school was the first time I dabbed. I actually have still never been as high as I was that day. I got so high that I was babbling random thoughts, passed out and puked in the car, and then fell asleep on my couch after eating Sonic when I got home. I can't even look at that memory fondly anymore, I wish I never would have found myself there. Skipping forward to my senior year, I'm now smoking weed every morning across from the school in the morning. I can only imagine how terrible that was for my learning mind. Getting fried at 7:30 in the morning only to go to class and zone out for hour after hour. My grades never really suffered, I had maybe one C throughout high school. However, I definitely had the capacity to do achieve so much more scholarly than I ever did. Getting high before and after school instead of reading textbooks, studying, and whatever else normal high school kids did. So I was able to smoke weed everyday in high school without my grades suffering, which put me under the assumption that it would not be doing me any harm.

Fast forward through my first 3 years of college. I have not made any friends, have not joined any club or organization, and often struggled to find the motivation to attend class and do my work. It's around this time that I realize that the dabs are certainly playing a role in this mindset change. I have been so used to that instant gratification, whether it be taking a hit of wax, or hitting a cartridge or whatever. I was so in my head, only cared about fulfilling my own desires, fueling myself with dopamine. I also never had any desire to find a relationship. Instead, I was satisfied with my relationship with Mary Jane, the only girl I needed. Well here I am now, summer before my last year of school and all I can say is that I want to do better. If you actually read this whole thing I appreciate you, I just had to get this all out in the open.

TLDR: Don't get addicted to weed in highschool and end up depressed/lonely in college",30

These past two months have been filled with change and shifting and movement. All big, positive and sometimes unexpected changes! The first weeks were hell, I felt like I was dying (to anyone in the first weeks-I know what you're going through and I feel for you!) And even up until I hit the 1 month mark things were a massive struggle. I spent a lot of days in bed, feeling really low, feeling absolutely exhausted.
 
I finally, FINALLY am feeling pretty damn good most days. I never thought I would feel so comfortable and at peace with myself, just myself, with no substances. I am so glad I made this decision. As a bonus that I hadn't realized until this past week, I had also cut out all caffeine during my early weeks of withdrawl as is recommended and I haven't had any caffeine (coffee, sodas and all) in the past 2 months. A few additional addictions that I had been relying on for some sort of comfort that I can also proudly say I've let go. I feel a little healthier each day. I feel happier. I feel more alive.

For those who are struggling- keep pushing forward and remember that we are all in this together! This decision may not be an easy one, but learning your capability and strength and really having a chance to experience life is such a beautiful thing. There is no other high like it.

Much love to you all! 💛",9

My question is this: **When you were around 20-25 and smoking all the time, what was your long term perspective of MJ**? Did you have this thought that you would simply quit when you were ""older; with more responsibilities""? Did you feel as though it was feasible, to continue this habit throughout your life on a daily basis? All answers are welcome, I just wanted to gauge an idea on how your perception was at the age I am at now (22/M) VS. what ultimately led you to parting ways with this plant. I quit about 4 months ago and have come to the realization that many of my peers are addicted but don't see this as an issue like I did. I know we are all different creatures and don't react the same to weed but on a deeper level, I really can't imagine the habit getting much better; easier to quit the older you get.",2

I don't hate weed but it's definitely not too healthy at my point of life, being a financially struggling student. I've quit before for about a year but I started back up for another year, daily for the last few months. 

The last time I quit, I quit cold turkey. It was only easy because I had met someone who was really supportive and helpful of me, but that person isn't in my life anymore. While help is always nice, I feel I need the self control to do it on my own. During my year of quitting, I did relapse a few times but never two times near each other, just occasional bursts, which showed a lack of self control (ADHD doesn't help either lol)

My whole philosophy is that if I quit cold turkey, it's gonna be ass for a while but it'll be over after a while. My idea is that if I taper off instead, then I'll slowly have time to understand my thought processes in order to develop that self control, rather than taking the ""get over the shiftiness faster"" route. What are your guys' thoughts?

Also, I would appreciate any advice anyone has for the ""shakes"" or ""heartbeat"" feeling from quitting. I can sit through myself but I accidentally get irritated towards people during those moments. I don't want my healing to hurt others. Thank you!",7

Do you know how to make it stop?,"Hello, I'm a 23 year old. I started smoking daily around 14 years old and didn't stop until recently except for a 3 months period a couple years back. I stopped smoking around 8 months ago. I have been having really vivid dreams ever since, every night, and I feel like I can't rest.

When I smoked I used to sleep 12 hours a day but barely had dreams (or remembered them) but now it happens every single night.

For me this is the only bad thing that I feel ever since I stopped and I don't want to go back to it for a number of reasons.

I was wondering if any of you guys ever felt this as well and if so what did you do to help with it? Ideally I would love to not dream at all, and I was hoping I didn't have to resort to a psychiatrist and pills.

I also recurrently dream about smoking and get panicked because I didn't want to smoke, like my subconscious did it.

I have tried to look everywhere for some straight up good advice, but there isn’t much information on it at all. 
I live with my boyfriend who doesn’t smoke, and I decided to quit for not only me but of course for him. 
I know it’s something I have to be able to do by myself, but I can’t do it all by myself. 
I need support and help with it, even if it’s helping to avoid my triggers or spending the time with me to help distract me from not smoking. 
I talked to my boyfriend for weeks before I quit to try and help him understand what I would be going through, what kind of support I need and what he can do to help me through it. 

So I finally quit, it’s all gone, and I was positive for the first hour or so before my mood changed, which I always expected.
My boyfriend spent the first part of the day sitting on the couch with his phone, just completely locked on it. He would get me to lay down with him to “cuddle” but trying to hide he was still looking at his phone. 
And when I went to sit down at the table, he assumed right away that I was going to paint or something (you guys understand that motivation is completely dead and I don’t want to do anything except think of smoking again)  so he turned on the PlayStation to play his game. 

I can’t help but feel irritated and stressed out, so I don’t notice or mean to talk in a slightly aggressive way sometimes, and he takes such offence to it. 
Last night before bed we had a fight about nothing really, but he ended up storming out of the room and sleeping on the couch, which he has never done, and I fell asleep crying and feeling crap, especially because I normally smoke up whenever we fight to cope, but I had nothing this time. 
He left this morning for work without trying to sort it out (he won’t be back until 7pm tonight) which made me have one of the biggest mental breakdowns I have ever had my whole life, it was scary, especially because I didn’t have my usual go to bud to smoke to numb it. 

It’s like he just can’t be bothered, or see what I’m doing is for the best, for both him and me. 
It’s like he is just trying to avoid it now until the withdrawals are gone and it’s easier again. He doesn’t understand the storm going on in my head and how I can’t simply be normal right now.

I don’t know what to do or say, but going back to bud seems like the best option because he can’t deal with my withdrawals. I’m struggling so much, but it’s too hard for him to deal with. 

What do I do? Please help me. 
If I’m in the wrong let me know. Being off bud has completely fucked my moral compass or being able to read things correctly so I just don’t know what to do. 
Is this all my fault?",3

I’m a week sober from smoking and I was a pretty heavy smoker, usually wax and bud. It’s been hell honestly. I still have no appetite and I get nightmares every night. I quit smoking because I thought weed was heavily affecting my appetite, but not in a positive way. Like it wasn’t stimulating it anymore? I’m sure it’s not uncommon but I’m wondering if anyone else experienced appetite loss even as a heavy smoker? I could achieve an appetite but only after smoking an insane amount. My ‘morning j’ with my coffee wouldn’t even jumpstart my appetite, I would have to have 2 or 3 before I would feel anything remotely like hunger.

I've tried to quit probably close to 100 times over the past four years of near daily smoking, and the longest I've managed to abstain in that time is 12 days...

I can't help but wonder if my struggles with quitting are partially due to my situation. I've been lurking on this board for almost a year now, and I've noticed I often struggle to relate with other people's experiences with weed dependency. I don't have any trouble breathing, I never feel anxious or paranoid while smoking weed, and it hasn't directly hurt my career.

The reason I desperately want to quit is because:

* I barely even feel the effects at all anymore. It basically just levels me out. I really don't enjoy spending hundreds of dollars a month and wasting countless hours just to feel ""normal""
* It makes me boring. I've neglected all of my relationships with friends and family because all I want to do when not working is stay home and smoke. I do just enough to maintain them, but I know they're not nearly as strong as they used to be. Luckily I'm happily married, so I do have at least someone I socialize with everyday, but the rest have definitely suffered.
* While my career hasn't been *directly* hurt by this habit. I know it's holding me back. I've always been a high achiever, but I feel like I've been coasting on all my efforts up to this point in my life instead of continuing to reach ever greater heights.

I almost feel jealous of people here who can think back on their times smoking in such a viscerally negative way as a motivator to not give in. For me, while all of the above is not ideal at all, it's also not terrible, and the physical *act* of smoking still makes me feel very relaxed. For me, when I think of my time smoking, I think of cuddling with my wife and dog on the couch binging some awesome TV show (we're going through Six Feet Under right now).

I am committed to continue abstaining, but this is my first post here and just wanted to share some thoughts that are bouncing around in my head. I'm sure I'll be posting more in the days to come.",8

Right now is the chance to grow and create this fresh new slate   
One free from self hate   
Where I don’t get stuck in my own mud  
Trapped in a mistaken fate   
A heart that only knows how to wake and bake  
Desperately trying to shake the aches    
realizing weed’s not gonna pump the breaks   
On depression, a mental health lesson    
That I’ve just been guessing at   
Grasping at straws    
Now I’m confessing that   
Saving this kief   
Vaping this chief    
High hopes were wrong hoping highs have relief   
Chased more escape, thinking its all I need   
Just one quick blunt, then I’ll be freed   
From the misery, fizzle out history   
Blur it by smoking tree   
Wash it with listerine   
Too scared of sober scenes   
emotions now visiting    
Finally visibly confronting my hidden dreams    
Forgot I got rid of these   
Hopes and ideas   
That went up in smoke from fully stoned years     
Coulda woulda shoulda, regrets often steered    
How I chose to act inspired by fears of facts   
Like inevitable death, or environmental collapse   
Existential crisis got me itchin to relapse    
But I know that’s not the way   
It’s just me from the past from a different kind of day   
Now to choose a new craft   
Like a branch on a tree,    
something new, something free    
Something fresh, something me   
Another chance to live a little life soberly

Was smoking for 4 years constantly, hit the bottoms bottom, got anxiety and could probably say paranoia, not doing anything with my life in those 4 years, knew I had to change something, but it can wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow after tomorrow and 4 years passed like nothing. After a good talk with my best friend last year, whom I know since we were kids, i just broke up. Opened up with all the issues, lies( and boy there were MANY) and stuff that was going on, and after that talk I just decided to quit. What was strange, I ""talked"" to myself many times before and I knew I had this problem, I know what is the solution, but I just couldn't make myself to stay on that road. And that was killing me. I just became something, a shadow that can't even stand behind their own words( what are you then actually?). Anyway, don't wanna go to deep down that rabbit hole again, cuz there IS a light at the end of a tunnel. How I helped myself? First, if you think weed is the problem, address it, cuz thro the time you developed a guy(or a habit if you want) in you, who is exactly like you, but his ONLY job is to be high. It was easier for me personally to see it like that, rather than calling it a habit ( even thou it's actually just a habit), but giving it a ""persona"", i could see it as a ""live"", existing problem that is a part of me that I need to fight with. Thing that helped me personally a lot( since i was struggling with self-esteem) too was keeping up with the things I say I'd do that day, week or any planned schedule ( I believe that helps to ""toughen up"" the real you, helps you with self-esteem and you feel stronger to fight the guy( or habit) that only wants to smoke). That doesn't have to be finding cure for cancer, in my case sometimes it was literally just walking out of the apartment, doing the dishes, studying that one lecture you need, doing homework ( insert what matters to you here). It's hard on the start, but 1 little win per day( the one YOU said you'd claim) and boy they will keep coming. Was struggling with that ""special, unique moment"" too. What I mean by that is let's say I go out with my friends, I have an amazing time, and in that moment, sometimes it crosses my mind ""man, if I just was high, this would probably feel 10 times better"". But it wouldn't. Why? You need to find your own, personal why, mine is I just learned to appreciate quality time I'm spending with dear people now, like literally in that moment now, without asking what would happen if this or that happened. At the end I wanna say i don't blame weed for everything that happened in those 4 years, It gave me some of the good memories, cool points of ""views"" on the world, cool people I met, many of them can smoke and do their shit without consequences, but I wasn't one of them. Maybe I'll smoke from time to time in some future, but I just wanna get my shit together right now. See you on the other side peeps, cuz life is really beautiful if you make it out to be! :)",8

I’ve smoked multiple times before and I did enjoy it but I never understood why people actually buy it or smoke everyday. I’d go a whole year without smoking again and be fine. But that was when I was anxious teenager who was so scared to even smoke. 

I don’t know what caused me to pick up the habit everyday. I’m a nursing school student (graduated, about to start working, soon to take NCLEX & officially be a RN), so I think that the stress of moving to online had a lot to do with it. I was also scared I wouldn’t pass. I never liked drinking much at all, so one day I had the bright idea that I was an adult and I could buy weed to help with the stress. I usually only smoked every few months when I would see my FWB for sex since it does intensify things. But then I realized I really liked getting high. I liked all the giggles, how it took my mind off stress. I was going through a very hard time and I feel like the weed was essential for my journey to heal. 

I would stop for 3 days, tell myself I’m not buying anymore, and then end up buying it again. Once again, I’m a nurse, so this can’t be a lifestyle for me. I can’t just smoke weed all the time. At first I felt like it gave me energy to get my shit together, to clean, to come out of my depression. But then I’d smoke just because I was bored. Then I’d smoke again and lay around watching tv all day. I felt like I couldn’t enjoy life anymore without being high. 

Yesterday I had my last wake and bake because after spending a whole summer of waiting, trying to afford paying for my NCLEX, I finally got my ATT and they said they could get me started on the 27th. Thankfully I’ve already taken a drug test and passed to get this job, and hopefully I won’t be tested anytime soon. But at one point I thought “I could still smoke. It’s gonna be legal soon, anyway. I can control it. I know how to pass a drug test, I’ll be fine.” I don’t want that. I want to be a good nurse, and I want to be happy, and I want my life to feel meaningful without the weed. I crushed my bowl and threw all my lighters away. 

That being said, I think Mary Jane is a beautiful thing. It taught me a lot during my time of being crazy over it. I’m thankful for all that, and I’m thankful I was able to see things in different ways. It was a big part of me healing from my depression. I’ve realized it’s just something I can’t do everyday. I don’t want to live my life like that. I’ve told myself many to times I would quit and I know for sure, within my soul, I really mean it this time. I haven’t been able to sleep at all, I haven’t had any appetite but I know things will get better. I can’t wait to feel normal again and not like my life is just darkness. Good luck to all of you. You’ve got this!",5

I recently concluded that I have an unhealthy relationship with weed. This understanding was informed by the reflection I did in order to understand and evaluate my relationship with alcohol. On that front I ultimately concluded that I have an early problem, but the trajectory was definitely getting worse, and the wise decision would be to not drink.

I have not smoked as much weed with nearly the consistency that I drank. That said, when I have weed around, it is hard not to smoke it and when I do smoke, I want to keep going through the night even when I had previously intended to go to bed. I have gone long stretches smoking every evening at various points over the past 15 years.

Early in the pandemic I drank and ate whatever I wanted. More recently I’ve decided to get healthy and find other ways to make the most out of this time. I’ve noticed that when I smoke I find it very difficult to control the munchies and unlike most people, weed keeps me up rather than making me tired, so it’s messing with my sleep quality and quantity. 

My question you guys is how long does it take to feel like your brain has gone back to normal? How much sobriety?",2

Short time lurker! Found this sub by accident!!

I never intended to quit using cannabis. It was a love/hate relationship from the start, years ago . After recent trip to Seattle, I fell in love with cannabis!!
Fell in love enough to risk bringing it back with me to a non rec state!! 

Once I ran out, I discovered I could get a med card!! That open the doors wide!! 

Now like I said I never intended to quit, even when my tolerance got high enough that smoking became more of a habit, I actually felt normal after smoking!  It seems my body has forced me to quit. I developed CHS 6 times, in 3 years!!! Last two times I figured what was going on. 

I’m on day 10 of being sober.. and it’s been rough! CHS symptoms on top of withdrawal symptoms!! 
I look back and realize, cannabis was pulling me away from my family and friends. ALL I wanted to do was smoke listen to music or play COD mobile! Oh and eat, and eat, and eat! 

I thought cannabis would make me a more engaging person, but I wound up isolating myself. 

So far my mind feels a lot clearer, I’m dreaming and I’m saving $$$$. I spent a ton on cannabis and gear. I have every portable and desktop vaporizer in the market and glass wear.

I am grateful for CHS, because otherwise I wouldn’t have stopped! I now realize i was numbing myself, don’t get me wrong I believe cannabis has a therapeutic purpose, but when it’s abused the effects can be devastating.  It’s not a harmless little plant.  
I’ll be 50 next month, and have a family and responsibilities.... time for me to start acting like it! I think of all the time and money wasted!! How much further ahead I could be , if I invested half the effort in my development rather than trying to grab the latest strain!


Glad to see others out there dealing with similar issues and managing to rise above! I can use all the inspiration I can get!!",5

Ive been lurking here for a really long while, a few years actually. In total Ive smoked for about 9 years mostly on but a little bit off, usually because no access. The first time I tried quitting was when I was about 23. Every time since then I would hold i off for a few months then get back at it, usually because of underlying depression or something. April this year, I decided to just stop and not make it a part of me anymore. I celebrated 420 and on April 23 (my favorite number), I stopped. Since then I have been pretty good at laying off it, reading posts here has helped alot, but then also just wanting something better for myself, trying to cause better fate for myself. For the past 2 years or so that weed was ""giving me bad luck."" Like Im a pretty superstitious person when it comes to being jinxed and the evil eye, and I for a really long time I could call it - I smoke weed, I know something unfortunate will happen to me. Lose my keys, lose money, get rejected for a job,... the list goes on and worse has happened. So it just got to a point where I didnt want to attract this kind of energy anymore. Please dont get me wrong. I love Mary Jane, and I think I always will, but maybe its just not for me, and probably not right now. The reason I mention this is because so much has happened these 3 months and Ive been so terrified of fucking it up, that the one time i was offered weed, I actually rejected it, for fear of attracting bad luck. Between April 23rd and now, July 23, Ive been able to turn a lot of my life around. Not only do I not smoke weed anymore or even think about it that much, but I also went from being unemployed to being hired in my dream company, in a dream country and city. I dont know if its got to do with attracting good luck by not smoking weed but who knows? (Honestly I realize its got to do with more objective things than that haha)

I know this is just the start, and I shouldnt feel overly confident about having gotten over my addiction, but where the new job has moved me, it is highly illegal, and there is no fucking way Im going to fuck this up for a lil measly high. I cant wait till a later time for it. 

Im doing a little better, but theres a lot I still need to work on. Residual anxiety and paranoia are the 2 main ones... But I just wanted to share one of my wins with you guys.

Thanks for all your posts people, youre a really great community.",4

2020-07-23 11:35:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hwhren/60_days_pretty_meh_honestly/,"60 Days, Pretty Meh Honestly","Not sure what I'm looking for out of this post, maybe just to vent, but here goes. 60 days ago, I cold turkey quit a pretty ridiculous habit of smoking all day, every day for about 2.5 years. The first week or two were very difficult, to be sure. I work from home, have for many years, and that made it easy to smoke constantly, lol. I was going through about an oz of high grade flower every 3 weeks or so. I was smoking a little less chronically for the prior 30 years. 

Here's the thing, now I kind of feel like ""whatever"" about the whole thing, lol. I quit for two main reasons, my health (smoking is just shitty, obviously) and I hated the whole ""having to have it for everything"". You know, that awful feeling of running out, or having to travel and it being an issue, or whatever. I'm quite sure this is relatable to most of you. I clearly couldn't moderate. I guess I've accomplished addressing those things, which is great.

That said, I never really hit any ""rock bottom"", I'm fortunately able to afford it, it wasn't affecting my job, etc, etc. So, now that the initial withdrawal issues are long gone (although my dreaming is still off the charts, lol), and I don't really crave it, I feel a lot like ""what was the point, was it worth it?"". It sounds crazy, given what I just wrote about what I've accomplished, but its how I'm feeling. I'm not sure how else to express it, but, weirdly, I was happier having quit earlier on, when I was struggling with quitting, than I am now. 

I guess I just miss it?  I don't know, it seems stupid having now tried to put it in words. Well, ramble over. I don't plan to smoke again, just wish I felt better about it than I actually do. Carry on, and good luck with everything, people. Peace!",47

This will be my 3rd attemt this year at being committed to abstaining from tree. The last time i buckled it was late march and the lockdown had begun. I was so stressed out bc i still had half a semester left at UNR and i had no idea how serious this was I could only imagine the worst.

My BIL was outside smoking a blunt and it didn't even feel like I was making the choice to smoke. It felt like i was watching myself on the outside.

I've been emotionally dependent on weed for about 4 years, including i think 3 years of smoking tobacco with weed. It was a gateway to developing COPD and lung cancer. 

For awhile, smoking weed and tabacco together controlled my whole life. I almsot got kicked out of school because my drug abuse had left me emotionally numb and unmotivated in my life, exacerbating my depression and anxiety in this vicious positive feedback loop. 

Now, I'm a graduate with a Bachelor of Science, trying to find a job where i can make use of my degree.

I want control back of my life, I want my dopeamine receptors to work better, I want to get a job and start my career, I want to pass the FE (fundamentals of engineering) so i can continue my goal of becoming a professional engineer in the future. 

Most of all, i want to be happy of my own volition, not because i had to ingest a drug. I'm going to keep moving foward and keep this community in the back of my mind. Along with why I'm fighting to stay strong and sober. I want to be a real man, someone whose there for my family, significant other, and anyone who is being prayed upon and treated unfairly. 

TLDR: Its day 3 and i needed to remind myself why i need to quit and what I'm fighting for. Thanks, and have a good day ya'll :)",5

I relapsed hard almost 5 weeks ago and started smoking daily again after a 9 month streak. Well yesterday morning in the shower I was scrubbing my chest when I noticed a small hard lump in my left peck. Fearing it was cancerous I called my Dr and they told me to go straight to Hospital to get an examination done. When I arrived I had a physical done followed by a blood test and an Ultrasound scan. I waited 3 hours for the results and I can say that was the longest 3 hours of my life.

So, 3 hours later a Dr invites me into his office and tells me that I don't have Cancer but I do have breast tissue starting to develop. He asked if I had done Steroids to which I replied no. He then said it must have been caused by the high amount of THC in my blood. He told me that they can surgically remove it but I will have to quit Cannabis first or else it will just grow back.

When I got home I decided I was going to quit again so I can get this problem fixed. Last night was quite rough and I thought I wasn't going to sleep at all but thankfully at around 7am I managed to drift off and catch about 4 hours of sleep with amazing and intense dreams. There were no night sweats either which I'm pleased about since that is one of the worst withdrawal symptoms IMO.

So watch out guys, Cannabis might just give you man boobs LOL. Here I am at Day 2 again and looking forward to getting this THC out of my system.",7

2020-07-23 06:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hwd68t/6_days_in_and_struggling/,6 days in and struggling,"First of all, I want to express how thankful I am for this community existing. The first three days of abstaining from weed were mostly awful, and reading the previous posts have helped me so much in continuing my journey.

I am 6 days in, and really struggling. I feel the need to reach out to express my trouble and possibly receive some encouragement to keep going. A bit of background of my smoking history:

I have been smoking weed every night on and off (mostly on) for the past 11 years (I am 28 years old). Although I have been smoking highly frequently, the amount I smoke is significantly tiny. All it takes to get me high is 1-2 tokes of a joint, so 3 grams can last me up to 2 months. Despite this small amount, abstaining from doing so is proving to be a living nightmare. It's weird, I am experiencing so many positives already, yet most of my waking life feels clouded by a sense of detachment and a sense of 'no self'.

I don't particularly miss the high, but I do miss how I would generally feel and think during my days 'sober'. I feel somewhat afraid of who I am becoming without the influence of weed, it's almost like I don't recognise myself and I no longer have any concept of my values, passions & interests. I am somebody who has always been self-reflective, and I've spent a lot of time reflecting on my life experiences. The main drive for doing so is just out of self-interest, but it also proves to be an effective way for me to understand who I am, what I like and dislike, who is important to me and who isn't, and how I should best spend my time and effort. 

Now that I have been sober, this capacity to self-reflect is essentially completely gone. I am now unable to conceptualize or imagine the past or future. It's like my entire consciousness is devoted to the here and now, which should be a good thing, but it feels painful in some respects. I formed a career goal to study, in the aim to pursue a career in clinical psychology. My ability to imagine that future was the driving force behind me completing my studies. Now that future imagination has dissipated, I am 100% not interested in studying. My creative pursuit has always been to produce metal music, which also hinged on the ability to imagine/think of riffs or song ideas. This creative imagination has gone, rendering my creativity useless. The career and creative pursuit was the basis of my activities for when I am alone. Now these are gone, I simply cannot stand being alone. I find slight reprieve from my suffering by interacting with people (which thankfully I can still do at work). And like most of you have experienced, my emotions are so fucking full on. Extreme bouts of anger, frustration, sometimes euphoria, boredom.

Despite the negatives, the positives have been overwhelming to say at the least. I feel so confident in myself all of a sudden, and the intensity of my self-doubt has decreased down to almost non-existent. Anxiety about the future has seemingly disappeared, and I don't feel like I am stressfully yearning for the next big thing. I also feel no reservations towards being honest with people anymore, I'm no longer scared to say what I really mean. It's almost like I desire nothing, and it is kind of nice. But i suppose this lack of desire is leading me into this corner where I have no idea what to do with myself anymore. In the midst of this despair, I really really really feel like smoking to return back to a world where I feel that I know myself, but I am determined to not go back there. 

Has anyone else felt like they didn't know who the hell they are after quitting weed? How did you manage this lack of direction? 

Thanks for your time guys :)",2

The thing is that we don't know if tomorrow will come..
Now that I've stopped smoking, daily tasks seem easy and it is pleasent to take action NOW, the present moment is all we have and it is sad not being present because of a ****ing drug. 

Take action, do your laundry, go to the dentist, talk to your friends, tell your loved ones you love them, pay your bills, take care of yourself NOW, because if you don't do it, no one else will.

There were some extreme lows in the first 2 weeks, much of those lows have no subsided and I’m finding joys in lots of things I used to do when I was high like video games and watching TV but I’ve also picked up reading and I gotta say I love it, really relaxes my mind, I absolutely love history and I’ve learnt so much it’s great.

The biggest issue I’m now facing is sleep; the lack of it. So would really love some advice / reassurance

I go to bed feeling great most nights, tired too. I usually fall asleep and an hour or two later wake up with lots of anxiety and feel very uneasy. I’ve got into a routine of not looking at screens 2 hours before bed, then a shower and read until I’m tired. I’ve been taking some natural melatonin substitutes (here in the UK you need a prescription for melatonin tablets) that have helped a little bit. I’ve also cut out caffeine and I try not to eat after my dinner.

I have seriously let myself down SO MANY times. I’ve loved indulging in the moment—but the next day I am always filled with shame, as well as a huge weed hangover. These things have made me realize that it really isn’t worth it.
I look back and realize I’d been smoking for eight years.. EIGHT YEARS. I missed so many genuine moments and experiences.
I have done a lot of soul searching to realize that I began doing it to “cope” with the losses of my Grandmother and my Uncle within one week, my mother’s mental health declining, my family falling apart, my depression, etc.
It has taken me losing my mother to a brain aneurysm unexpectedly to really open my eyes on how it hasn’t helped me cope at all. It’s only made me feel better in the moment to only feel so much worse later. 

I have realized how much it has held me back. I have realized how much it has hurt me.

I’m 24 and I feel very behind in life.

I want to begin living my life fully.

Any advice or words of encouragement would help me so so much.

Thank you for being so inspiring and kind. I appreciate each and everyone of you.",12

At the beginning of quarentine I took to snooping through my dad's room out of boredom, underneath his desk was 2 big jars of medical weed, now I had known that he used it for ptsd. But being naive and curious I decided to take a bud, and look up a yt video of how to roll a joint, after quite a few attempts I managed an ugly toothpick of a joint and remembering to inhale ( I had vaped some, which is another thing I am definately not proud about) I proceeded to get very stoned, from one puff. 

  I was suddenly engrossed, everyday when my parents went to work I would sneak in and proceed to smoke an average of 4 joints a day, it wasn't until about 3 weeks of repeating this, that my 14th birthday come up. Now, i had told myself that for the special accation I would get extremely high (bad idea I already know) so when my dad was out getting a cake and stuff, I took give or take 2-3 grams of jaimacan gelato from his jar, and kept loading my Trumpet mouthpiece bowl on my water bottle bong until there was nothing left. 

  I was fine until about 20-30 minutes later when I was suddenly the most nautious I have ever been I felt like I was spinning, and I had to run to the bathroom and throw up twice, afterwords I felt a little better but then I was hit with a wave of anxiety and paranoia to the point where I was peaking through my blinds and I swore that my dad would be home any minute, and while that was happening I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack cause my heart was beating so fast. There was one point where I had a solid 5 minutes of straight shivers up my spine that didn't stop until I finnaly got up to try to drink some water. 

  My dad had finnaly come home, but I was still way too nautious and high to even talk to anyone and I tryed to convince him that wasn't feeling well so I ended up ruining the rest of my birthday and I eventually just pasted out and when I woke up i didn't know who I was, nothing felt real, and everytime I closed my eyes I could see static, and the static would take 5 seconds to fade when I opened my eyes. 

  I was put into the worst depression, and I had somehow convinced myself that weed would solve that so stupidly I proceeded to smoke another joint, but all it seemed to do was increase the symptoms, and that's where I am now it's been about a week I've been trying to stop my weed intake, but i keep having the worst mental withdrawels paired with derealization and now what I'm guessing is hppd. I don't know what to do im scared to go to my parents or get any help. Any suggestions would help a ton. I'm probably going to get backlash cause of my age, but I just don't know what to do anymore.",2

After recently going three months without buying any weed, I bought some yesterday after bumming ""a little"" off my friend last week.

Instead of allowing myself to fall for two weeks while I went through my purchase, I trashed the stash today and am rededicating myself to complete sobriety from pot.  I am sad that I went on a bender of sorts for a week or so, but I am happy to know that the last few years of trying to quit have indeed yielded progress.  I am still heading in the right direction, this journey is just not a straight line.

I just wrote in my journal to remind myself next go-round that I got ZERO enjoyment or happiness from the pot I bought yesterday.  It only made me sad, killed my productivity, and temporarily stunted my personal growth.  Trying to hide it from my wife also caused me immense anxiety.  I will learn from this mistake and continue to build toward the ultimate goal.

If you're trying to quit and trip up, don't let it keep you down.  Get back up as soon as possible and keep going.

Good luck guys",1

I am currently on my 3rd day of no weed and let me tell you, today has been rough. Throughout the day I have been getting chills coupled with strong urges to go outside and smoke. My head also feels strange, its like I can feel all of the receptors in my brain screaming for THC. Its not quite a headache but it feels ""raw"" in a sense?

I could have texted my dealer and had some in my hands in less than an hour but all I could think about was how that would be a step backwards. Buying more weed isn't going to make all of these bad feelings go away, its only going to delay them.

I have also noticed a benefit, even after only 3 days. When I was smoking daily I found that my patience with other people was extremely short and my irritability was through the roof, my emotions were ruling me. Now I feel more in control of myself and am able to think through situations more easily; instead of simply reacting to them.",11

2020-07-22 15:39:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hw0iff/day_1_ready_for_this_journey/,Day 1: Ready for this journey,"Hello all! I first wanna start off by saying that this sub Reddit has seriously given me so much motivation to better myself and it has really opened my eyes to the deceptive nature of weed. I think that joining this community is really going to help me stay accountable for my actions so I really appreciate reading everybody’s comments. Here’s a little bit about me: 
Basically, I started smoking when I was 14 years old and it wasn’t until I was about 16 years old that I started using it on the daily. All of my friends are heavy users as well as my sister so I’m basically smoking all the time. I am 20 years old now and The main reason I have to quit is because I am applying to nursing school in December and I will be drug tested before I am admitted into the school. Honestly, before I joined the sub Reddit I was very anxious about the thought of quitting because I wasn’t seeing any problems with using it. I make excuses saying that it helps me feel good and I like using it with friends.
I never actually realized how deceptive the drug is until I started watching YouTube videos and reading your guys comments about The reasons you all quit. I had to do a lot of thinking about what I want in life and what it’s gonna take to get there. After thinking long and hard and reading other peoples stories I realized how many ways that weed is secretly controlling (and destroying) my life and the reasons I need to quit one and for all: 
1. Weed is ruining my social life because all I want to do when I hang out with friends is smoke weed and get high or else I will feel bored or anxious about having to be sober and just make up an excuse to leave. I fear that if there’s no weed involved that we will have nothing to talk about or nothing to do. I want to be able to have a fun time with my friends while being sober. But that means getting new friends because all of my friends smoke and don’t see a problem with it.....
2. My studying habits and attention span seem to have flown out the door. It’s hard for me to concentrate or even get motivated to study for my nursing entrance exam. It’s very important for me to be able to complete my academic tasks especially because the next school semester is coming up quick and it’s online. 
3. I want to start getting back into reading and writing. I used to love to read books and write stories in my journal but nowadays I don’t have any drive to pick up a book or write my feelings out. I really just don’t have much motivation at all and I think that’s the main thing that I want to get back..

There are several more reasons why I want to quit but I suppose the most important reason is that I want to feel motivated to complete my goals and to enjoy the simple things in life with a clear state of mind. I feel so hazy and fogged up all the time. I can literally feel myself getting dumber each day and I’m afraid if I continue my habits that I won’t get into nursing school. I want to be myself again! Enough is enough! My day one starts today and I’m going to get a daily tracking app to help remind me of my progress. Thank you guys for taking the time to read this, this is my first post and I plan on posting regularly to help keep myself accountable and to support this community!<3",2

I’ve had diagnosed depression since I was 19, which is the same time I started smoking weed daily. I can’t tell which came first; smoking to escape my problems or if smoking led to worse mental health.

At this point (15 years later) I’m a functional stoner in that I only smoke before bed and it doesn’t seem to interfere with the rest of my life. During dépressive periods, weed was always a nice escape.

I know ppl often experience depression after quitting but I’m curious about the opposite — has anyone’s depression been alleviated? I never thought it was a problem bc I didn’t struggle with motivation and sitting on the couch but now I wonder.",3

It’s seeing references to it everywhere and knowing that part of my life is over.,"Just subbed here and figured I’d make a post. I quit weed ~1-1.5 months ago because it was causing issues in my marriage. I was sneaking around and getting high when I was supposed to be taking care of the baby and spending money I didn’t have to have my brother in CA send me cartridges. I had been an avid pot smoker for 13 years and it was never an issue for my gf (now wife) until our child was born last November. She was ok with me still doing it every now and then but I wanted to smoke every day, hence the sneaking around. I of course got caught because she’s not blind or stupid and basically gave me an ultimatum, quit and get help or we get a divorce. So I agreed.

So far it’s been going alright. I actually started an anti-depressant around the time I quit and I think it’s helped a lot in taking the edge off and I started a program for drug counseling. I’ve only had a few major cravings since quitting, but what has been hard is being reminded of it. I see and hear references to it constantly. It’s in tv, movies, music, here on reddit, etc., and often when I’m reminded of it like that it’s hard not think about how I won’t get to do it anymore. How that thing that’s been a part of my life and identity for so long just won’t be anymore. Can’t be. It’s kind of like losing a friend. Weed was always a comforting thing for me. Granted, all it was really doing was numbing me, but that was a sort of comfort in its own way.

Anyways I’m not really sure where I’m going with this. I mostly want to vent and thought this would be a good place for that. If anyone can relate or has some advice, I’d love to hear it. Thanks.",40

I feel like I’m no longer living life to the fullest because of pot, but my sleep issues hold me back from making another attempt to quit. 

I have horrible sleep problems when I’m sober. I can’t fall asleep until at least 2 AM, sometimes even later. I either have to sleep in embarrassingly late or wake up early and sleep-deprived. I’ve tried to reset my sleeping cycle multiple times, but it always returns to frustratingly late again. 

When I first got sober, melatonin was a godsend. Then for some reason it stopped working. I tried every natural sleep aid I could find, to no avail. I went through a stint where I was taking large amounts of Benadryl to force myself to sleep every night, with rapidly increasing dosages because of my building tolerance. I don’t need to explain how bad this was for my body. I replaced the benadryl with alcohol. Then I started to wake up frequently in the night if I drank myself to sleep, so I started using benadryl and booze at the same time. This would have undoubtedly spiraled out of control if I hadn't gone back to the pot around this time. 


The tossing and turning, the physical discomfort, the agony of my overactive brain (I have several mental illnesses and it isn’t exactly the most pleasant thing to listen to my thoughts), I don’t want to return to this awful nightly routine. Pot is the only thing that can knock me out consistently. 

I feel like I have to choose between suffering the negative effects of pot on my life or suffering my insomnia (and the inevitable benadryl usage) again. I don’t know what to do.",1

Cannabis might be a substance that most people can use without getting addicted; however, for a small percentage of people (roughly 9%), it can become really hard to quit. I appreciate the ""protection"" the cloud of cannabis offered me through my youth. But when I attempted to use it in moderation, I was always gradually drawn back into daily use. These repeated failed attempts at using in moderation continued for 10 years. During a weekend workshop (in which I had to be sober for 24 hours before and afterwards) I was finally able to see that my excessive cannabis use was keeping me timid and withdrawn. My circle stayed small, due to the fear of the unknown. I stayed ""self-medicated"" in that comfort bubble for too many years. 

I finally stopped altogether on July 22, 2006.

The one I turned in yesterday asked about the pros and cons of my substance use and then asked about activities that could give me the pros without the cons. When my counselor looked it over he asked if he could copy it to use as an example of what he wants to see out of the assignment and said that I did it perfectly. The rush that gave me was better than getting high, it was better than the time I got a test back from one of my profs in college and saw written across the top answer key (I'm guessing he checked it first and since I got 100% used it to check the rest).

There is a trend among smokers and relapsing it seems. It took me many years and many failed attempts to stop to come to this conclusion. Relapsing is going to happen but I fear people don't take it seriously enough. I've even seen conversations around how long someone should be clean before they smoke again ""to see what happens"". That is playing with fire. If you do relapse know that its ok, life will go on and you'll most likely attempt to quit again at some point in the future. Don't work yourself into a mental state of despair because of it. For the vast majority who become addicted and then at some point in their journey take a hit of weed to see what its like or what will happen, in many cases, that'll lead you back to smoking again at your old levels, or worse. Even if you did not enjoy the affects of the ""test"". It might not happen that day, week, or month but it will. It piggy backs on the same process that got you addicted in the first place. For those who've been hooked your mind is well equipped to become hooked again and weed is just the main ingredient that it needs. The other ingredient is the disolving of your established boundary with weed. You won't see it disolving, at least not right away. That first hit will set you up for it to happen though and you won't even notice until its too late and you'll need to start the process over again.

I would be the person who would initiate these proceedings but oboy, not this time. I firmly said, ""NO"".

My friend was taken a little aback but to his credit, he just smiled with understanding and said, ""If you're not having fun, then what's the point"" and went on to smoke on his own.

This got me thinking. Most of my friends and I started smoking weed because it was **fun** to be high, to think thoughts which you would never get while not high. But at some point, the ""fun"" part goes away and all you're left with are the ""thoughts"", of which, if you're like me, can only be about how unproductive I can be and can quickly descend to self-pity and self-loathing.

I made it three months. The first two weeks were utter hell. Constant depression, constant anxiety. Wake up feeling depressed. Stand up and feel like sobbing. But I had work, and that gave me structure. I'd get up, eat a couple of slices of toast and a coffee and go to work. 

After the first two weeks of feeling the first real chemical depression I've had in my life, the constant feeling started to ebb, and it shifted into a wave form, where I would occasionally feel like my head was above the surface, only to descend again, but I knew I was starting to win the fight, so my morale started picking up and it became easier to quit.

After the first month, 60-70% of the chemical withdrawals were gone. I still had some bad days, but the lethargy was disappearing, exercise was getting easier, eating food was starting to feel normal again, and I was starting to take on new challenges.


After three months, I told myself I could manage conditional use. Big mistake. 

Four months went by in the blink of an eye, and somehow I managed to summon the courage and willpower to start the two week process all over again.

I'm now a week and a half in, and it's not easy, and I'm kinda scared because these chemical symptoms are making Uni work incredibly hard to face, but I'm soldiering through it, and I know I can handle it if I just keep my world small and focus on one thing at a time.

Throughout the past 2 years you’ll blessed me with some great moments and some super shitty moments. I won’t ever forget how I felt after I got crossed and couldn’t stop throwing up and had the spins. Or that time where I decided to stay home instead of going out with my friends, because you were my favorite Mary Jane.

You taught me so much about myself. But most of all you taught me that I am not myself with you in my life. That our relationship is toxic. You want me to remember only the good times, but the bad times is all the floods my head.

I struggled to leave you first, but eventually succeeded, but the battle never ends with you, you pass my mind every so often.

But I’m strong, I’m different, and I’m myself again.

Right around when I turned 16 I started getting high daily, puffing on the stiiizy pen by day and by night (longest and only break was 40 days). For such a short time doing this  my mental state has decreased by a considerable amount. Many things have been impaired such as memory, visual memory, creativity, judgement, comprehension, and metacognition (thinking of your own thinking). 24/7 I find it very hard to keep a straight thought without getting distracted or just blanking out. Emotional energy doesn’t seem to be anywhere near as present as it used to be, it’s strange, I could be having the best (or worst) time of my life but I don’t exactly feel it.

Socializing is difficult, often I’ll loose track of a conversation or fail to find a response that I’m satisfied with. A lot of the time I’ll get pissed of at someone throwing conversation at me because I feel they are applying pressure to get me to respond. For the most part I prefer being alone but it’s not at all what I want. 

Of course all this mixed up reflects on my life poorly, ya know telling yourself to stop doing this shit while you watch yourself slip over and over, harder and harder doesn’t really make you feel good about yourself. Where I stand now I got no clue whether or not I can recover from this, nothing seems to be enough to satisfy, I just graduated and I don’t see how I could live a life with my current mental state. 

Anyways all I want is perspective of someone who went through at least something similar, I need to know if what is impaired can be repaired to any degree, it’s not something anyone I know can help me with, you gotta be here to really understand what it’s like. Thanks for reading !!",2

Here is my story so far: 

Before Quarantine i was only a night time smoker. Then once i could not leave the house because there was nothing to do. I resorted to more weed use. I woke up and smoked till i went to bed and time went by so fast. It was my routine. Slowly i realized it was not good for my health and went back to night time only. 

4 days ago i made the decision to stop and it was the easiest hardest decision i have ever made. With the support from my friends it was much easier and i knew they would have my back no matter what. 

On day 4 what is bothering me the most is what to do? From the time i started to smoke weed, i used my free time to smoke. The time went by faster and it felt good too, so why not. Now i am stuck in this loophole where what do i do now.. 

I miss dreaming the most. I remember all the great dreams i had before and part of my motivation to stop was wanting to dream again. 

I downloaded an app to count my days and even though i am only 4 days in, i am proud of myself.

Today i also finally woke up with so much energy.. i was so used to waking up half blasted i got used to thinking thats how it is supposed to be but no... today i woke up great and cant wait for tomorrow morning! 

With that being said, It is nice to meet everyone and i will give another update on 1 week!",10

2020-07-21 19:21:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hvibz3/sober_day_30/,Sober Day 30,"Today marks 30 days for me of being free of weed.  I tried to quit at the beginning of June but relapsed on the week leading up to Fathers Day weekend.  The last day I smoked was actually on Fathers Day, June 21st.  June was hard and at first I had severe withdrawal symptoms.  Anxiety and depression were very apparent and I noticed it right away.  Sleep issues were horrible with vivid dreams and sometimes I woke up in a panic.  The feeling of being short of breath can be really strong.  I have always loved swimming with my kids and holding my breath as long as possible under water.  I could not do that at all during the month of June because it caused panic symptoms.  I used to be really good at holding my breath for up to a minute or longer.  10 seconds was a challenge for me due to the issue of panic. I have since been able to hold my breath longer and much of my anxiety has passed.  I still have issues with sleep, but I am sleeping longer blocks of time at night, instead of the typical 2-2.5 hours before I'd wake up from a lucid dream. Last night was the first time I have slept solid for 5.5 hours.  Naps during the day have helped me get through some of my sleep issues, but usually I don't take naps.

Some of the posts on here have been very helpful for me. I have been dealing with depression still and I cry when I think about my kids getting older, parents getting older, and most of all myself getting older.  I am 46 and have smoked off and on since I was 18 when I first tried weed. I had periods of time when I did not smoke or consume any cannabis.  The longest period of time I was clean of pot was for 20 months when I was 39 until 41.  I started smoking again to deal with stress of marriage and family when I was 41 and I have smoked every day for the past couple of years.  I never felt symptoms of PAWS or any real withdrawals when I had quit before.  I don't believe I have ever had depression or anxiety before this past month, but maybe I did and didn't really recognize the issues.

I have stopped all substances, no coffee or any caffeine, no weed, no alcohol, nothing in my system other than clean eating and lots of water.  I have lost 40 pounds and feel much more clear minded.   I did get diagnosed with diverticulitis on July 6th.  I believe that the stress of quitting weed was the main contributor of my flare up.  I am sure that smoking, being over weight, not exercising and eating what ever I wanted contributed to the diverticula that was most likely already present prior to the stress of quitting. Quitting this time has been exceptionally hard as I have had to face some fears of aging and managing stress with a different and sober approach.  When you're stoned, you have a ""whatever"" attitude toward anything stressful.

I am still wondering when I the depression will subside.  I have good days and bad days and I do have faith that it too shall pass.  I have had my testosterone tested twice; once before I quite weed and alcohol and two weeks after I quit.  Both numbers were low, but the second time was really low.  I imagine that the stress also contributed to the exceptionally low number on June 15th.  Now that I have lost weight have cleaned up, I am hoping that my T levels will level out on a more normal scale. I am scheduled by my physician to be tested in September to check again.  Hopefully my story can help others on here as I have read many of other posts that have given me inspiration.  Cheers with a glass of iced water.",5

Hitting my buddys shatter pen is how it started. I finally had a weekend off after working 6-7 days a week. After 10 minutes of intense anxiety, Ill admit the high was awesome. Was on a weekend long fishing trip, so needless to say it also became a weekend long binge hitting my friends pen. I didnt initially regret it, was a great time and was reunited with an old highschool friend I havent seen since high school (im 26). Only thing is he's married, proper.. which is all good and fun, just kinda seemed like I wanted him to see the sober me. This is the same guy that initially pressured me into trying weed over 10 years ago, although he didnt let it take over his life like I did.

After that weekend, canada day rolled along, I thought hey what the heck its a holiday, smoked some more.. a few days later I bought my own shatter pen.

Honestly not worth it guys, not to demonize the drug all together but if you generally lack control or holding up routines, and even basic adult responsibilities, then your life is so much easier off without it. 

Ill most likely go a little longer trying to fit nightly, maybe even weekly smoking into my life, realize its not gunna workout. Hopefully I find that out sooner rather then later",1

I’ve been a lurker on here for a while and I’ve been back and forth about weed but after what has recently happened, I’m finally committed to being done.

This past weekend I took an edible I recently bought from a buddy of mine. He told me that the edible was powerful so I decided to take half of it and see how it was. Well...it was extremely powerful and after an hour, my chest was hurting and it felt like there was a lot of pressure on it. I’ve had this feeling many times before, but this time it really felt like I was really in survival mode. I almost considered going to the hospital but I felt that I could make it through and luckily I did. 

I got through the night and I’m still feeling slight chest pains to this day, but I’m hoping that it’ll pass if I eat healthy and stop smoking. 

Not only that, but I just found out my older brother has a tumor next to his heart and it’s cancerous.

I have been a heavy smoker since around the beginning of my freshman year of school. My relationship with weed has had its ups and downs but I was able to get through college with a 3.1 gpa no problem. 

    So fast forward to now, I have been unemployed since April because of COVID, but I was planning on leaving anyway so it worked out. So since April I would say my smoking has picked up and I now am into concentrates. I have nothing to do most of my day and that leads to me smoking as you all know. 

 I recently spoke to someone who will be getting me a job come fall and I will have to pass a pre-employment drug test so I almost have no choice but to stop. I love weed and the thought of stopping is very scary to me, although I know it’s what has to be done. My attempts at a “T-break” or “a week or two off” have all failed in the past. I think this is because I never really took it serious. Getting this job is super important to me so that I can get my life started. 

I was just looking for some tips on staying abstinent and what to expect. I do eventually want to smoke again once I am settled into a new career and feel the time is right. 

Just looking for some people to talk to that have some good insights

Don’t really have any advise for anyone except to think about and focus on your reason for quitting everyday.  And when you feel like you’re ‘missing’ whatever it was that weed gave you, try to find a healthy replacement. 

just as an example, and It may sound weird, but weed was a way for me to connect(or feel connected) to my spirit world. A few days ago, I started to really miss that connection.

Last night was the first night with no THC and my sheets & mattress are SOAKED I've had a fan on it for like 2 hours now and it's finally starting to dry.

I don't normally sweat while I sleep, and I have the buffy comforter and sheets that allow cooling/maximum air flow.

A little back story, I quit for almost 2 years 3 months ago, the time i was sober from Cannabis was some of my most memorable time in the last 5 years, The reasons i quit; Not being able to eat ANYTHING without smoking 2-3 joints before hand, Couldn't sleep unless i hit my  vape a few times before bed, I couldn't even go out and hangout with friends unless i had a way of getting high before and during the time we hungout. Cannabis was literally controlling my life every day, spending a stupid amount of money monthly on getting high 24/7, When i quit for almost 2 years i ended up saving A TON of money, i was in the best shape of my life, 3 months ago i decided ""Ill smoke but only after work, only once a day"" Yeah that never happened i went straight back to smoking 2-3 grams a day, Now im back on the road to recovery, i hate waking up in the morning throwing up or dry-heaving  for 30mins, im hating the fact that i actually HAVE TO BE PRODUCTIVE and do something with my time,

However i can't wait for the day i can eat 3 meals a day without an issue, i can't wait till im excited about dinner again, i cant wait to get back into the gym / running again i cant wait till i can enjoy playing video games again, I CANT WAIT TO HAVE MY LIFE BACK AGAIN

I've been lurking in this sub reading posts for about a month or so. Finally got up the nerve to post. I smoked a joint for the first time in November. I'm in my mid twenties, and I had never tried it before so I figured why the hell not? This has progressed to smoking daily since COVID hit in March. I was waking and baking every morning until about a month ago. I figured why not be high all the time until the pandemic works itself out? Life seemed better with weed at first. I was carefree and stress free. There was nothing better to do! But now I want to stop. I'm tired of how it makes me feel-my lungs are heavy, my eyes are constantly red, i'm throwing up some mornings after I take a big bong rip. I don't even really feel ""high"" after smoking anymore. I get a head rush for about 10 minutes, then severe anxiety- to the point where I've had panic attacks about situations that would NEVER happen. Then my mind goes blank and I get tired. Weed doesn't even make me feel good anymore.

My roommate works full time at a dispensary, and he brings product home every single day he works- which right now is 6 days a week due to the pandemic. We smoke together every night. I usually will smoke some sugar or shatter before I go to sleep. But last night, he asked me and I said no. He looked at me funny- and I tried to explain that I'm just tired. I feel like I've lost myself. I feel like the only redeeming quality about me now is that I smoke weed. I don't even know what I like outside of weed anymore! He tried to tell me that I'm crazy, and weed is nature's cure-all. He told me ""Weed isn't causing these feelings, you're just getting in your own way."" I didn't expect him to stop, I just expected a little bit of support and consideration. I think the hardest thing for me will be being around him while he's smoking, because I know he's going to try to talk me into it. I know its also going to be hard to be around a couple of my friends who are very serious stoners.

I'm going to make myself a promise here. I will not smoke today. I will not smoke tomorrow either. Thank you to this sub for finally giving me the courage to STOP SMOKING WEED.",5

I’ve quit a few times this year but always indulged when hanging out with friends. I’ve realized two things with this pattern:

1) I connect on such a deeper level with myself and with the people I love when not high. Once I smoke while I’m with friends, I can’t feel the same level of closeness to them or myself anymore. It’s taken a really long time for me to understand I really, really enjoy the connections I have with others and myself, and weed makes those connections less meaningful when I’m high. This was a hard pill for me to swallow.

2) I love myself when I’m productive. And I’m productive when I’m not high. I always thought I was just lazy, had a low baseline for energy, just enjoyed staying at home and smoking, eating, watching Netflix. But as I’ve tried to quit and go days without smoking, I’ve started to see it’s the weed that brings my energy level down. I’m no extrovert but I seek out more social interactions when sober. I actually exercise. I make to do lists and actually complete them. I keep my room clean. I actually read when I’m not stoned.

I love being sober and enjoying my time instead of being in a high stupor, and falling asleep on the couch. I love being with friends sober and enjoying the small things with them.  It’s much more gratifying navigating my emotions when sober than numbing myself out.  Actually feeling and facing issues head on without weed help me expand my toolbox, instead of thinking I’m incapable of dealing with this and immediately escaping with weed as a coping mechanism. 

These realizations are what I hold onto now whenever I’m in a situation where someone brings weed. It feels good to be good to myself. It’s taken 26 years for me to realize that but that’s okay (:",10

2. Get a new drug. Not literally...
Like I said expertise was mine, a new hobby for you? Community service? Something.

3. Kill your boredom.
Boredom is one thing that held me back. And eventually you get the point where boredom does not always bother you. Find something. Read.

Tedd talk over.


I quit two and a half weeks ago because I was going on an intensely busy trip for work so I figured I'd be too distracted to suffer much... Which was true. I did have cold sweats and an irrated throat but honestly I was just so busy, I didn't have much time to think about it.


Now it's already been two and a half weeks since my last joint and I'd be lying if I said it was easy. It's been worth every second. I've learned to say no and stand up for myself. 


My SO continues to smoke but is now banished to the kitchen so the rest of the house doesn't smell. He's been really supportive and has also tried to cut back a little bit.


My emotions have been all over the place. I've woken up in tears but I've also been so glad to feel my feelings after 12 years of antidepressants and weed. My brain is still a bit cloudy and I've just recently started dreaming again.

I haven't smoked in exactly 48 hours. The last 2 days I've had this somewhat mild 5/10 pain sore throat that started in my sinuses (thought it was a cold) and is now in the middle of my throat. Additionally I have a tickle in my throat that makes me want to cough. No fever,spO2 levels are 96-99%. I've been insanely irritable, I dropped something on the floor earlier and almost broke down in tears and started throwing things. My dreams have been absolutely insane, and I keep waking up in cold sweats.

Does this all sound like it's from marijuana withdrawal?? I smoked about 1.5g a day for the past 5 years, and stopped cold turkey. I've been smoking for the past 20yrs, but not as regularly as recently.

 I see some others had a sore throat too but it was with a productive cough, which mine is not. Does this all sound par for the course? I really don't want to go to the doctor and expose myself to Covid if it's just common withdrawal symptoms. It just doesn't seem to have progressed at all, and I feel so frustrated. I'm also very busy at work but took off today because of how i'm feeling.

Just a little update. I'm on Day 2 and, as a seasoned quitter, I have gotten quite good at knowing how to begin the quitting process. I have written 3 rules which definitely help me and hopefully can help others get that first day in the bag,   


1. Do something active for at least 1.5 hours - I know after a lengthy period of getting high you might feel pretty unhealthy, however it's really good to keep your self distracted and get a little taster of the benefits of quitting long-term. I did a little workout in the park for like 1.5 hour which was honestly the best part of my day and for the next few hours, I didn't even think about smoking. Following this, I cooked up all my left-over food and cleaned the kitchen, keeping my mind thoroughly distracted for the best part of the day. 
2. Quit almost all your other vices at the same time - the thing is with drugs and general unhealthy behaviour (eating junk food/ staying up late) is they kind of come as a whole package. It's often tempting to treat yourself with something (beer or ice cream for me), however these things will just remind you of getting high and cloud out that rational, sober part of your brain which doesn't. Also, alcohol obviously affects willpower so it's a definite no-go. For me, quitting cigarettes is also vital although I do have an emergency e-cig to hand if I get a major craving. 
3. This one will be unique for each person - you'll all know I'm sure that there's a certain time in the day when not smoking is almost unbearable. For me, it's around 9pm - I lose my fucking mind if I can't smoke. I'm crazy restless, I don't know whether to chill out or do something productive and I'm just desperate to escape my thoughts. The key in this period is to distract yourself until the point where it's no longer viable to smoke. I recommend calling someone, perhaps doing a bit of exercise or reading a book, preferably something which you don't associate with draw. The thing to remember is that intense craving will probably only last about 20 minutes and if you distract yourself, it'll be gone before you know it. This is the moment where I've failed time and time again, and last night I was soooo close to going downstairs and finding my tobacco in the garbage and nicking a bit of hash off my housemate. BUT, I didn't. Instead I puffed on my e-cig like there was no tomorrow, read a book and drunk a herbal tea. Once my body had accepted that I had put my mind to another task, thoughts of relapsing soon ebbed away.    


Thanks for reading everyone! I hope this helps those who are trying to get over that first hurdle. Remember that the first day is one of the hardest and the key to sobriety is learning hot to manage those difficult days.",13

I feel lonely. Genuinely lonely. When I leave my girlfriend and her pretty normal family, I feel incredibly lonely. My own family has never been that close. I don’t have any friends, except for one person, but I haven’t made contact with him in over a year because of my addiction to cannabis. I got trapped in my own head and in a self destructive pattern where I isolated myself from everyone in my life.

What should I do? I’m considering doing an 8 week challenge at my gym. At least that will help me meet people with similar interests. But when I’m alone, I can’t seem to help this feeling of loneliness. I’m really shy but when I get to know people I open up a lot more. I know this probably has something to do with being clean for a month, but I want to know what I can do to open up to people more and become more social. I don’t want to spend my whole life thinking about how I can improve for next time. I just want to be better today.",8

Firstly, i've never done any ""hard drugs"" but smoked weed for about 17/18 years. I stopped about 3 weeks ago. Last night i had a dream that has really rattled me.  
There was a guy, not sure it was me, but he was shooting heroine into his left hip. There was some ""time pressure"" from another person/voice who said something about ""1 hour left/to go"" and then he proceeded to shoot this into his hip. As it happened, my entire body went cold, the same kind of cold you get from a sudden release of adrenaline. for example in the event of a highjacking etc..  


I am inherently afraid of needles in general, so this dream makes me squirmish when i recount what happened.

Is there any meaning to this? Am i overthinking this situation? Is it just something that happens?",1

Started with a brownie at 17 and honestly I have always loved weed (sadly probably always will). It became a personality trait for me and I got DEEP into it (I love plants/botany/biology and got hooked on the science and used it as an excuse to go deeper in until I was dealing so I could smoke all I want for free, making edibles for entire sororities, and preaching to friends how it could solve their issues...) as time went on and my “hobby” became a habit I started using weed as an escape from everything. 

Frustrated? Smoke. 
Happy? Smoke.
Mad (Raging mad)? Smoke. 
Celebrating? Smoke. 
Sad? Smoke. 
Regular day? Smoke. 

You know how it goes...

I thought it was this magical substance that was FAR better than alcohol and other drugs (I come from a family of alcoholics and thought being a Stoner made me “better” because I wasn’t decimating my liver every day). 

At the end of the day a drug is a drug is a drug. 

I’m an addict, it’s in my genes and moderation with anything is unfortunately not my friend or even a distant relative. If I can get my hands on it I’ll abuse it, simple as that. Took me far too long to realize it, but now I’m clean and trying hard not to look back.

I used weed to silence all the thoughts in my head until eventually I wasn’t even thinking about things that actually mattered in my life like moving forward and progressing towards the goals I’d set for myself. The goals just vanished and all I really cared about was consuming THC. I worked at my job to get money for weed, got paid, for high, and *thought* I was happy. Smoking everyday takes a big toll on your mentality and your memory, the past 6 years feel like a blur and I can’t remember a lot of important events unless someone describes them in detail to me.

Over time I realized all weed ever did for me was make me ambivalent until the high wore off and I either had to smoke again or was forced back to the harsh reality of my thoughts. I just didn’t care about anything when I was high because I mentally did not have the capacity to do so. Let me tell you, ambivalence is NOT happiness, it’s a cruddy charade for true happiness which I’m only now beginning to experience.

Weed did keep me from committing suicide during some pretty bad times, but looking back I can’t say that I wouldn’t have been in such a position if I wasn’t such a heavy smoker :/ 

As an aside please don’t ever end your life, there’s so much to live for and if you peace out prematurely you’re doing yourself and those around you a major disservice. DM me if you’re feeling that shitty, there is light at the end of the tunnel no matter how far away it seems you can get there and the light is fucking AWESOME.

I will say quitting was HARD. Far harder than I thought, I’m finally having dreams again and honestly I hate it. I miss being able to pass out without worrying about nightmares that jar me awake or dreams I feel guilty about, but I’ll just have to process them like everyone else does and move on with life.

The important thing though is that it is possible to quit and you can overcome it. Practice your mental strength and if a certain situation or friend group is too much, walk away. You sanity and well being far outweigh any social ties or obligations you think are important at the time. You CAN quit and you WILL feel better. If you try to quit and fail, try again. If someone enables you despite your relationship with weed, fuck them they aren’t your friend real talk.

Looking forward to more months (and hopefully years) of a life without weed. Love ya’ll and keep on the grind. I’m starting medical school next month and plan to focus my education on addiction/substance abuse so maybe in 4 years I’ll be back with better advice and legitimate data on how to walk away from the green dragon.",1

I started off vaping thc 1 gram carts than moved to flower later on, it was a daily thing. I think I’ve always had a cart on me there was never a time where I hadn’t had a thc vape in 2 weeks + I realized when I got my final transcript that my grades were slipping and I want to catch myself and better myself before the start of this school year if I can at least stay
 clean until the first day of school(Aug 19) I believe I can stay sober for days, months, maybe even years after.

I’d like to have someone I could talk to Incase I ever feel a relapse coming in. 

Please leave any tips that could be helpful and share your stories please.

Things that I know will go away if I smoked but I’ll end up facing them later on regardless. I’m still my father in laws plug. I buy weed to sell to him. I make a few bucks here and there. My plug even gave me free weed to try out but I gave it all to my father in law. My smoking routine was always waking up in the morning to go outside and smoke while I watch my kids play. Well today I went out there thinking I’ll have cravings but I didn’t. It’s just weird being out there and not smoking or not feeling high. It was my first time out there since I stopped. I have roaches and half finished blunts around the backyard from when I useto smoke but I wasn’t tempted to touch them. I know the negative consequences I’ll get from starting. I know I’m stronger than that and I know I can resist the urge to smoke. I haven’t tossed them or anything else because I know I’m strong enough to say no. If I cant say no to the stuff I have laying around the back yard then it’ll be hard for me to say no if someone offers it to me. It’s my way of doing this and I am in no way recommending it to anyone else. 

I feel alot better from reading all these posts and comments. Especially the comments that were towards the posts I made. They all helped me get through it all. I know my sobriety journey isn’t over. It’s still going to take work because I do have those depression thoughts but I do what I was told on here, to work out or do something to keep me busy. Last night I slept really good. Not as good as I want but better than the past 2 weeks. Gives me hope that these withdrawals will go away soon.
I’d like to thank everyone that helped me get through this and everyone that reads my stuff. I kept asking a lot of questions and it’s questions that get asked a lot around here. So thank you all that respond, not just to my posts but to everyone else’s too. It really does make a difference to them. It really does help them out. This group helps them out. All we need is the support that we don’t get at home, even if it’s from strangers. Might be strangers but we are all here for the same reason and we almost experience the same thing. We are stronger than we think and we can all do it if we put our minds to it.

Just a few days ago I joined my family to go on vacation, and since I am a minor I was forced to leave everything at home. I’ve been wanting to quit for a while now, but haven’t had the strength. I’m now three days sober after months of smoking multiple times per day. In the beginning of this I was just looking forward to going back home and smoking, but the more I think about it the more I want to continue my sobriety streak. 

Now the real issue I’m facing right now is going back home. Did I only have the strength to quit because I had to? I’m scared that I’m too weak and as soon as I get back home I’ll go right back to it. I’m scared that once I smoke again it’ll be hard for me to quit on my own. I have CHS, cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome, which affects my ability to eat when I’m not high because I rely on weed to become hungry sadly. I have just eaten my first real meal thankfully, and I think I’m starting to gain my appetite back. But-

In order to sustain my addiction, I told myself many lies:

1. ""I need weed to enjoy food."" *Wrong. It made me seek out garbage food which is engineered to taste good but has poor nutritional value. I've discovered how great fresh, nutritious food can taste! Junk food is an addiction of its own.*
2. ""I need weed to sleep."" *Very, very wrong. Weed disrupts REM sleep. One night without REM sleep is fine. Years without it is hell.*
3. ""I need weed to be creative."" *I have creative hobbies. Weed makes me lazy and okay with not working on them. If anything, it makes me less creative.*
4. ""If my friends smoke weed, I need to too."" *I used to live with roommates who were fine with smoking all the time. It was a continuation of my college days where we'd all smoke together. Something better left for fond memories, not carried well into adulthood.*
5. ""If I can't handle life, it's not weed's fault, it's mine."" *Probably one of the most insidious. For the longest time I believed that weed has no negative mental health effects. The r/trees subreddit is dangerous in this way... people there are so used to advocating for legalization, they take it too far and lie about the negative effects.*
6. ""I don't have a lot of free time."" *Oh yes I do, I just smoke it away. Life's clock is ticking. I can either live a waking dream, or give up this fantasy and become the person I've always wanted to be.*
7. ""I need to enjoy myself every night."" *This is the hardest lie to face. A life of leisure may be the dream for some, but not for me. I aspire to be better every day, and develop my skills to their fullest.*

I got promoted a month ago. I took on many new responsibilities. My job requires me to be sharp, present, and responsive. All these qualities are marred by weed. There was no way my habits would allow me to do my job well. My sleep schedule was a joke, my temperament was poor, and I was often a stuttering mess during meetings. So I knew it had to go for good.

This got me thinking about other paths I want to walk in life. I want to have kids someday. I thought of what it would be like to be high while my kid was hurt or sick. It would make me horrible parent.

If I keep smoking and eating garbage, I'll never achieve the physique I want.

I want to take my creative pursuits to the next level. I'll never have the discipline to do this if I keep my habit.

The promotion was the last shock I needed. It's over, I'm not lying to myself anymore. You might see in my post history that [I tried quitting over a year ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9krr2d/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_i_wont_smoke_today_either/). I failed, because I was still lying to myself, and I had some severe emotional problems to work through. I'll post more about this soon. One of the first steps to evaluating your weed habit is to take inventory of all the things you tell yourself about it, because they could well be lies.",223

 I’ve been smoking since I started college and moved away from home (I’m 23 now)  (I was homeschooled all my life and was thrilled I could smoke whenever I wanted since my parents are Not fans of weed at all) 
 
I started smoking before every class and it started affecting my grades, when I got home I would just spark up and then just sit there for hours, but I was young and didn’t want to take responsibility for my actions (especially since my parents paid for my school and housing and I was terrified of them knowing I was squandering time and money away on weed) so I blamed it on my anxiety (which while I did have anxiety, it wasn’t that bad then and has gotten worse since then) 
Quickly started failing out of school after a few semesters, but thankfully was able to medically withdraw because of the “anxiety”

Decided to enroll in a tech college, but was still failing classes, foolishly eloped, divorced and moved away. 
I got maintenance job and I started abusing adderall to get me through the shifts. This let to an obvious decrease of eating. 
I also dislocated my knee for the third time on the job which healed weird and doesn’t allow me to do things I once normally loved (hiking, running, rock climbing, ya know things that make you happy) my anxiety and depression was getting worse since I wasn’t able to be active, so I just sat around and smoked and numbed the emotions and pain. 
 
Moved back to where I live now. 
started welding school and a new bartending job. 
But the combination of the those two extremely, physically demanding things, mixed with the abuse of adderall, led to an even more decrease of eating to the point I would dry heave in the mornings, until I smoked and was able to stomach something 

Quit the bartending due to long hours and low pay. Stopped taking adderall and other substances and stopped drinking for the most part. 
But have continued to smoke consistently throughout the day, to the point of waking up, smoking and then laying in bed until I’m in pain/ nausea from the hunger and force myself to eat something. 
But I fix a plate of whatever I feel like I can stomach, smoke and then I just zone out and sit there for 30-50 minutes sometimes not eating. Then I end up eating only 1/2 to 3/4 of the food, losing my appetite and feeling tired and weak, so I end up just laying in bed. 
I got another bartending job, and while it’s better pay, It’s a lot more work and stress. 

So I barely eat at work, then come home feeling too nauseous to eat unless I smoke, but then as soon as I smoke I become a zombie and the cycle repeats. 
And since I feel so nauseous and out of it I don’t want to cook, and since I only have a mini fridge, a hot plate, and toaster oven, it’s a little hard to meal prep. I live alone and recently lost my cat.
 
So the stress from work, Covid, not eating, not knowing what I want with my future and my cat disappearing just fuels my depression and anxiety, and so I smoke to numb it. But I’m tired of this life. I don’t want to keep wasting $1000s of dollars and hours cooped up at home because I keep telling myself I NEED weed to eat and survive... I dunno I’m just super lost and tired and plan on starting sobriety in the morning, but I’m scared, especially of not being able to eat.. and I typed this out all in one go so I’m sorry if it’s just a bunch of word vomit.. 

I guess any advice and tips on managing eating and nausea while going sober would be greatly appreciated! ❤️",3

My pot use has always been on/off. I smoked all 2019 every single day till about last month of this year( went on a tolerance brake).

I recently came back after 7 weeks clean. First 3 times times I got stoned, happy high. After that it feels pointless to smoke again, and funny part I realized all of this while I was high. Well it's been 2 weeks smoking straight, not getting high, wasting money. But somehow Its in my mind 24/7 again? I dont have  girlfriend and my gym membership is a joke since I dont have the energy to go.

What did you guys do that helped you quit or stay off it for a while? Cause seriously the only time I smoke now is when I vape because it's not as ""droggy"" and a bong or a joint.

And also what the fuck,7 weeks clean and I only got high maybe 4 times max? Now I'm back to the same unhappy feeling with myself when I smoke and I absolutely know I have to take another brake, possibly for good. 

It's really hard to let go of something that's helped me so much mentally in my life so please understand why I might never quit 100%.

I’m confident we’ll all get what we want including letting go of the leaves. I’m sure we all tried to brute force this thing, trying to use our willpower.

How about we try approaching this completely differently? 

What if we take the attitude of “I know I’m gonna quit soon” and embrace an expectant confident type of mentality? 

If you google The Power Vs Force Scale Image, you’ll see where most of us are at in this game of getting sober, we’re at level 125. Desire. We’re enslaved here. 

We have to raise the level of consciousness of our player(self). Staying in our current state obviously isn’t working. 

Can you get to 350? Can you accept and persist in the awareness that you’re slowly but surely replacing the weed with a new habit loop? Even if you’re smoking as you’re reading this post? Lol! 

Also consider hard exercising. Then giving yourself a reward for exercising. Mine is food at the moment lol. 

Power is scientifically proven to be stronger than force. This scale explains why people fail. 

Take control of your expectations and take one action/reward loop that can replace the leaves!

I dont mean daydream in the sense that I start fantasizing about what life could be life etc. But whenever I am laying down in a relaxed state of mind and my mind starts to wander just thinking in general(With eyes closed majority of times), I usually end up transitioning to these low level dream states where my brain starts conjuring theoretical scenarios and places me in them. These low level dream states dont really tend to have visuals like a regular dream, but they still seem to feel kinda real. Probably the same way it would feel for a blind person to dream. I usually snap out of these pretty quickly, but I pretty much always end these daydreams properly. As in if I was to have a theoretical conversation with someone, I would have to finish that conversation. Or if I was a delivery driver delivering pizza, i would have to finish delivering the pizza before I exit the dream. But at least 60%  of the time it seems to be me having conversations as opposed to doing activities. And like I said, I usually realizing I'm daydreaming halfway through, but like dreams in general, they still have an element of realness to it, so I usually tend finish the dream properly to have closure. But in a scenario where I end up looking for my phone then I become alert to the fact that it's in my hand and I dosed off while watching videos, then yeah. No closure needed. The first time I ever remembered having these type of scenarios, was probably like 4-7 years ago. I dont remember if these were during my sober or high phases, but I'd say it was most likely if I was smoking that day. Also, I would only experience it if I was still awake after 4am. If anytime before 4am, I wouldn't experience it. But if it is after 4am, then I would describe it as my thoughts are more likely to become more vivid and I would have these ""pre-dreams"". Probably due to internal sleep clock shenanigans etc. But the point I'm making is I've noticed this starts to happen whenever my mind begins to wander as I dose off during my sober phases .

I have a very strong love/hate relationship with weed, it relaxes me and brings me peace but it also gives me extreme anxiety.

For me, if I stop I can never go back. 

I'm 22 years old and I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm still young, I should enjoy it while I can because if I stop that means I'm stopping for good. But on the other hand, its a battle between my mental health. 

I feel like I will never be ""ready"". A lot of my friends smoke but socially so it also gives me anxiety while trying to quit. 

I love coming home from work and relaxing with weed but I hate fearing it at the same time.

My biggest fear is the thought of never doing it again.

I had been going strong, experiencing so many benefits and positive changes, then I started thinking about maybe just trying a little... maybe moderate use could work for me... I vaped a small amount and was overwhelmed and did not enjoy the experience. I wrote myself a big note reminding me if all the reasons I stopped. I definitely wasn't planning to vape again. But the next night, I did it again! I hated all the effects, said that was the last time, but lo and behold I smoked a joint the very next night :( 

Even as I was actively not enjoying the experience, I kept making excuses. I was a daily heavy user for 8 years prior to the 55 day break, I need to keep reminding myself that the 55 days is so much more impressive than sliding back into what was my default mode for so long. I think I need to be done with this stuff for good. Now that I have some sober life to compare to, I can see objectively how much better off I am sober.

Some of the reasons I personally dislike smoking/vaping/being stoned and it's not worth trying it again anytime soon:

- the anxiety! Racing mind, stress, wanting to avoid negative thoughts but being stuck in loops of catastrophizing

- social anxiety in particular. I'm way more outgoing, a natural conversationalist, and feel way less self conscious when sober. When stoned, I stay quiet, overthink, and criticize myself harshly. When sober I feel way more confident and intelligent 

- the smell, the dry red eyes, the cotton mouth are all so unpleasant! I forgot how much it hurt my throat too. So not worth it. My under eye bags had basically disappeared after the first month of quitting, when stoned I noticed I looked exhausted and stupid

- the weird guilt and shame consuming my brain while telling myself I'm ""unwinding"", it's not even pleasant anymore

- withdrawal was HELL. Took weeks to be able to sleep normally, I'm so not interested in giving that up or going through feeling sick again


Maybe someone can benefit from my experience, mostly this is to remind myself the next time I feel tempted! Giving away the tiny bit I have left today, and posting for accountability. Please share your own experiences/tips if you like! So glad I found this community.",42

I took huge risks as an adult and left behind everything safe and familiar.  I've experienced being very lonely even while having friends and boyfriends and not having been trained how to communicate my needs.  I see this as something that has nothing to do with genetics and everything to do with what I absorbed growing up which was a loving family with poor communication skills and co-dependence and a number of other things.  They say by even a few years old a kid is a huge sponge and is picking up on everything.  I remember lighting my dads cigarettes sitting on his lap with matches when I was 3 or 4.  They probably would of called CPS on my dad today.

I keep forgetting to listen to my NLP programs. They sit by my bedside, but I have to override my subconscious which doesn't want me to listen and go making changes. Ha! I'm convinced bad habits are merely a function of subliminal programming received through life.  Not knowing how pot and alcohol actually work to quietly enslave people is simply an unfortunate rock most people trip over as they fall down the hole.  So I'm happy to report that changing habits and beliefs is all about a change of thinking and retraining the subconscious mind.  Have a great day people.",16

He smoked a few times before meeting me but found it helped with his arthritic pains. Smoking together became a shared activity, but we didn't control our habit. 
About 3 years ago was when I first realised my habit had become an addiction. Since then I've tried to quit and kept telling myself 'tonight was going to be the last time', but I kept relapsing when I was having bad mental health days and kept smoking after. There was that one time when I went 2 weeks, it was at that point when I caved because of the smell lingering on my partner. I've always told myself I'll quit tomorrow, but tomorrow never came. I knew how weed affected my mental health, tiredness, and my concentration and memory. The latter became a friction point in my relationships, especially my partner. It made him feel like I wasn't listening, and that what he said meant nothing to me. I kept saying I will work on it. I did, I tried my best but some days were better than others. We fought again when it regressed back to what it was. 
Fast forward to today, me and my partner had a small fight about me not remembering again. When we walked off to think it over, I realised its the weed preventing me from doing better. I hate the person I've become. I hate hurting him because I've not actively listened to his answers to my questions. Upon this reflection, I told him that after what we have left (a day or twos worth) is gone I'm done. I told him that I've hated who I am with this addiction and I want to get out for definite this time. Its going to be difficult, I'm only at work at the bar 3 days a week atm and have been dealing with depression and re-entry anxiety post lockdown and I'm going to still want to have that high, the escapism from it all.

-	I think I got lucky that the withdrawal symptoms weren’t as bad as I’d feared. I used the Smoke Free app as a counter, and getting the occasional milestone notification was very satisfying. 
-	My first week I had nightmares every night, but that’s gotten better, and I now have proper dreams. I don’t think I’ve dreamt properly in years.
-	I cried once at 4 weeks. 
-	I now get about 7-8 hours of sleep every night. In bed by 11-ish, up by 7-ish. 
-	I eat breakfast everyday. I haven’t had breakfast this regularly since school. 
-	similarly, 3 healthy meals a day. I’ve even been cooking! It’s very satisfying to eat my own meals.

As part of my mediation journey I've learned to let go of expectations in general but if you still have them, it's best to at least set them realistically.

1) Acknowledge the likelihood of being bored, unmotivated, wanting to be alone or whatever the main emotions you experience are. Tell yourself...these next couple weeks gonna be a struggle. So when it comes you can just lean into it. I didn't feel like doing anything even stuff I LOVED for at least a few days. I just gave into it, did what my kids wanted, watched more tv than usual and just let it pass. Of course try to stay busy if you can but if you don't want to, don't....just don't let yourself get too bored that you're wanting to smoke. Get up and move I'd that urge comes. 

2) Tell your smoke buddies. Mine happen to be real friends that will even not let me smoke around them if I've communicated I'm stopping (tried several times and they always support, remind, and encourage me not to if I start getting weak)

3) Tell your girl/family or whoever you have to deal with daily and should know...""Hey I'm going sober and I want to let you know and ask that you be patient with me over the next few weeks or so as I adjust. I apologize in advance for any moments of frustration or seeming distant. Thanks for your support."" Or something like that. 

4) Find something specific to replace the moments you would smoke. Maybe a 30 minute walk in the morning/evening if that's your smoke time. Maybe meditation is something new to try instead. If you're familiar with the power of habit, you should replace habits to change them, not just stop. Think of your trigger for smoking, the reward and how you can swap out the act of smoking with something to get a similar reward. For me mediation helps me calm down, chill out, destress, be creative, all the reasons I smoke. 

Between telling myself the reality of the struggle that is coming, and telling my friends and family, I seem to do much better in the start. You have to keep it away after you get momentum. I've found it much easier after day 5 to not even think about it much once it's out of my rhythm.

I'm 21 years old. I currently work full time for my family's business in an office park. My Dad has smoked daily since he was 14 years old and used to encourage my habit when I was growing up by being my supplier, but we've come to an understanding in recent years and he supports my abstinence. He used to keep bud at the shop when I worked there in high school, but now that I'm back working with him he no longer keeps it around.

I recently started working for a car detailing place across the way in the same office park, and their workplace culture is... relaxed, bordering on irresponsible. The owner smokes dabs three times a day, most of the other guys smoke a blunt or two at lunch time every day, they party and drink a ton at the end of the work week...

I was poorly socialized growing up, I have mood problems that make it difficult to have healthy relationships with other people, and I haven't put myself out there so I can interact with guys my age. At first I thought detailing cars with these guys would be a healthy way to branch out and make friends, but I'm constantly put in situations where I feel the urge to smoke to fit in and deal with the stress of socializing, but I just shoot myself in the foot because I clam up and  isolate myself when I get high.

Is this just a lack of willpower and personal integrity? Should I distance myself from this job to avoid the temptation altogether? I would really appreciate some outside perspectives from users with more experience. This is my first post.",3

Every day when I wake up I promise myself I’m not going to smoke, but as soon as 8pm rolls around I become very irritable and NEED to smoke. However, once I have had a smoke I instantly wish I was sober. It’s a cycle I feel completely trapped in.
What I am wondering is, in the same way alchohol is a downer and can effect your mood for days after consuming (happens to me, I avoid it as I become very depressed) can weed be doing this also?

My bf and his “best friend” had quickly planned a camping trip for the three of us, plus the friend’s ex girlfriend. They spent the entire weekend bickering with each other, It was extremely nasty and toxic, culminating in a screaming match fit for /publicfreakouts and them almost actually getting into a physical fight yesterday. I cried every single day this weekend because of their bullshit. We are all stoners, though I have been tapering my weed usage for the last 6 months or so, and am the only one who can admit that it might be addictive or a problem for any of us. 

It’s incredible 1. How much everyone had to smoke to tolerate each other and 2. How nasty and full of rage so-called “mellow stoners” can be. My bfs friend has a total inability to communicate when things are bothering him, just acts like everything is fine, expects people to read his dissatisfaction from his sarcastic tone, and meanwhile he is seething with rage inside from every perceived slight (whether real or imagined), that of course inevitably bursts.

I am just so disgusted with everyone’s behavior. Despite us all being in our 30s-40s, I felt like there was not a single adult on the trip. All the while everything is bandaged over with weed. We will all probably never hang out as a group again and all our friendships have been irreparably harmed. 

Yesterday was a turning point for me. Despite the high stress situation and it being offered to me constantly all day, I didn’t have a single hit of weed. I don’t want this future. I am not like these people. I do not use weed to make myself numb to a horrible situation. I am learning to deal with difficult emotions with a clear sober head.",509

I can think much more clear. I’m not anxious that my boss or coworkers will notice I’m high. I can engage in conversation much more freely, lest of anxiety.

[M35],"Been smoking 3-4 joints per day after work for 20 years but 14 days ago I suddenly hit rock bottom from out of nowhere. I thought I was doing okay smoking everyday. I have a good job, girlfriend and I exercise regularly.

Things started going rough in my relationship and I feel like she is taking the first steps to leave me, which catapulted me down the darkest hole I've ever been in. I used to cope when things are hard by smoking a joint, but now it seem to escalate the anxiety I feel about my relationship. 

I never had major anxiety issues before but this shit is scary beyond belief. I went home crying from work 14 days ago and haven't been the same person since. This is my first day back at work since but I'm not even close to functioning properly. I'm barely holding on. I can't be alone for even a few hours, I can't eat, I can't sleep. I lost 5kg in 14 days. I temporarily moved in at my mom's because I'm so fucking scared to be alone. 

I decided Sunday the 12th that I had to stop smoking. This has been the hardest 7 days of my life. I have more hours in a day where I'm not completely hopeless than I had a week ago but things are really starting to take a toll on me and I'm not sure how long I can hold on for. 

I have been to my doctor 3 times so far but the only thing they have been helpful with is giving me a reference to a therapist and prescribed me some Promethazine to help me sleep. There is a 14 days waiting period for seeing the therapist and the doc is starting me up on anti depressant this week, probably Wednesday.

Any thoughts or advice about my situation would be appreciated. 

If you feel like I'm missing some crucial information about my situation for you to give advice or if you are curious about something, I'm happy to provide more information.

EDIT: Might as well throw in my last confession so you guys might have some advice on that part. I have been a porn/sex addict for the same amount of years as I have been smoking. The day I quit smoking, I also quit porn and masturbating, not by choice but because I was so down that I had no desires left. The last couple of days I have been watching some porn again, not much, but just to get my rocks off. I feel like I'm feeding the same addiction demon inside me, when I watch porn and I don't feel great afterwards. Any advice on this subject?",11

I started my fifth Day One 14 days ago and now I'm here. Feeling good about it! I have a ""first target"" of 30 days which will be the longest I've ever not smoked. Can't wait to reach that target and kind of meet myself again. I thought I'd just detail a few withdrawal symptoms I experienced this time around. I was a daily smoker for about 2 years and had been smoking on and off for a couple of years before that. 

Days 1-4 I was very depressed, I cried all the time, and when I wasn't crying I had a TEMPER. My sleep sucked, I wouldn't get more than 3-4 hours a night. Stomach cramps and diarrhea. Felt very zombified and was just not a pleasant person to be around.

Days 5-9 I was really, really nauseous. I'd finally stopped crying all the time and my temper was improving too, but I couldn't eat and just drank lots of fluids. Lost a few pounds because I just wasn't eating. Still cramping and diarrhea. My sleep started to improve a little. Still felt groggy when I woke up, but it would shake off as the day went on.

Days 10-present my nausea finally went away and I started eating normally again. Stomach feels a lot better and the diarrhea is less (finally lol). I started to get 6-8 hours of sleep a night and I will sleep through the night instead of waking up lots throughout. Still feeling a bit brain foggy in the mornings but basically just ignoring it and it ebbs away as the day goes on. My temper has massively improved and I'm starting to engage with dealing with my emotions in a healthy way. I look forward to things only improving more as I climb towards that 30 day milestone.

I highly recommend the Grounded and I Am Sober apps for tracking sobriety, Headspace and Calm for meditation, and Couch to 5k for running. 

The Leaves Lounge Discord also saved me many times. Lovely and helpful peeps in there.

I feel like something horrible just happened or like if something horrible is about to happen. I’m trying really hard to function normally for the sake of my kids but it’s so hard when depression keeps knocking on my door. I just find myself sitting there thinking about all the stuff that I haven’t accomplished yet. Thinking about what’s to come in the future, the good and the bad. I get depressed after thinking that life is short and we will no longer be here one day. I know it’s part of life and I’ve been okay with it but right now it’s hitting me really hard. I just want to feel normal again. I want to be there for my kids and my pregnant wife. I really do hope I’m better by the time my next baby is born. I was going to quit when he arrived but I now feel like it’s better I went through this now and not 4 months from now. I’m fairly new to smoking so I never knew I was going to have withdrawals. I was a semi heavy drinker and didn’t have problems stopping that a while ago so I didn’t think weed would do this to me. I regret sparking that first joint. I don’t ever want to feel this again.

The news coming from Portland is also scaring me. I just don't want to stop because that would prove that I can't handle things no matter how bad they are. I've had a stressful childhood to put it mildly and I got through that somehow without weed, I know I don't need it but I'm still stressed out. My stresses were still there when I smoked but when I'm not high time moves so slowly, I'm so aware of everything. As someone who's already hyper-aware due to personality and personal history, it's just a lot.

2020-07-19 18:32:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hu9mq6/a_second_start_at_stopping/,A second start at stopping,"I found myself wanting to quit a month ago - and I did.  
And I made it to 7 days then, and then I gave in to temptation, as I still had some weed left. And I felt bad for failing myself - but soon enough, within days I realized that a half-assed plan will result in half-assed results. And thats exactly what happened.

So here I am now - a month later - and as of friday, consumed the last remnants of what I had. Threw away different gear and storage containers I have used for my vice. The air-sealed glass jars - gone. The plastic, originally sunglasses case, I used to keep my finished and half-finished joints - also gone.   


Now I have nothing left to remind me of the ""good old days"" - I mean this with utter sarcasm. But I understood, that while my initial attempt was noble and worthy, it was not well thought out. I decided to quit on a thursday - and did so on friday. But there was not much thought put into that project.

I have now had a month to think about how I want to do this - and while I kept the Discord channel's notifications active throughout the period - I was constantly reminded, that the end of this smoking era will come to and end. Not cold turkey - not suddenly. But as something I have mentally prepared myself. 

In many ways I awaited until I would run out of my stash. And I now finally did. There is nothing left for me to smoke now. And this is how it should be. It will be difficult for me to relapse on a passing emotion -  resupplying is difficult and a hassle in general, that will take, most likely, 2-3 days at minimum.

&#x200B;

But now I am here, back where I knew I would be - stopping my relationship with weed. And I know this time success fill find me. This has been a desire of my own, to quit. Not an emotion I suddenly felt and simply quit. 

As I know now, that won't work for me - planning and preparing is what I need. 

So here I am, on Day 2. And it is just how I remembered it from a month ago - but lighter, easier, to be honest. Especially since I know I can't simply reach for the shelf and roll one, should I so desire.",8

2020-07-19 14:46:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hu5ob6/a_personal_revelation/,A Personal Revelation,"Hi r/leaves, I had a revelation after doing some reading, and I thought I would share in the hopes it will help you, as you have helped me on so many occasions.

I often ask myself, why am I addicted to this drug?  Why do I need it so much?  What I have found is that I need to feel better, due to a hole in my soul.  I just happened to pick marijuana as my choice for filling this void.  It's a substitute, and a very poor substitute at that, for what I really need.  What I really need is already within me, but I haven't grasped it.  If I tap into approaching myself with reverence and love, with kindness and compassion, my desire for the drug will disappear.  If I connect with others in a real and loving way, the craving loses its power.

When I use the drug I fill my head with self condemnation and self dis-trust.  See, I told you so, my self critical voice says, I knew you were too weak to stop using, you're not good enough anyway.   
 You are horrible for breaking promise after promise to yourself!  How can you be so stupid?  

My critical voice doesn't stop there, oh no.  It goes on:  You don't deserve an excellent life, you're not worth it!  You've been a loser, you will continue to be a loser, you're not even very likable.  Might as well just keep using, right?  What's the point of this struggle anyway, go easy on yourself and light up again.  Weed is your only true friend, it's always here for you.  And the cycle continues.  I run to the shelter of my drug.

So I am working on turning this around by affirming love and forgiveness for myself in my daily meditation practice.   I tell myself ""I forgive myself"".  I say ""I am worth a better life"".  I go on with ""I will always love myself, no matter what"".  ""I have much to offer"" and ""I'm ok, just the way I am"".  I think doing this daily, right when I wake up, will lead me to feeling better about myself, and help me to reach out to others and spread some positivity, which will also lift my own spirit.   I think the drug and cravings will have less power over my mind.

It's day 103 for me today, and I'm feeling hopeful.  I am grateful for this day.",20

Right, where to begin... well I've been smoking for about 11 years now, in the past few years, daily, and at its worst up to 7g a day of flower.   


I've always been academically gifted, I don't really need to try too much to retain information and learning concepts, ideas and what-have-you has also always come to me rapidly and naturally. I simply never had to try through school. My first shock was during my A-Levels around age 17 when suddenly my grades didn't reflect what I was used to, I got my first B ever. This B actually changed which University I could attend and altered the course of my life entirely, but lets forget about what could have been.   


So I head to Uni already in my head about being dumb, I've just achieved my 1st B ever and I'm also no longer attending the most prestigious University in the country... somehow University is a lot more subjective so I can coast again, I miss all my exams and leverage my depression as a reason for me to be allowed to take them in August instead of July. I do this for all 3 years and study last minute - somehow I come out with a 1st Class Degree, just what I needed. Along the way I destroy a relationship with the woman I love because I kept choosing weed instead of her, on top of that, when I didn't have it I was just a foul person to be around... unfortunately she left me eventually. I'm glad she did too, I was in a fucking bad way and just a shithead overall, only concerned with himself and his mistress the ole' Cannabis.   


I graduate with honours and get to work on a startup, I wont go into too much detail but the idea was fantastic (if I do say so myself) and we get immediate investment after proving traction. I'm 24 and I'm a solo founder for an Edtech platform for Students, wild. I'm from a dirt poor family who claim benefits mind you, so this was just insane. I'm now paying my Mum's rent, looking out for friends and getting the BEST weed you can possibly get.  


In a year I've squandered a pathetic amount on weed and the project is reaching a point where we need to get another round of money, I manage to hide the fact I've spent all of this by being tricky with the accounting but that's another story. This whole time I'm SOOOO blazed all the time, I've convinced myself this is my 'coffee' I wake up at 5am and get to coding and working, smash a huge joint every morning when I wake and smoke one every hour or 45 minutes thereafter for the next year, we've taken another round of money at this point but the understanding is that it will be drip fed to us as and when from a pool we've secured. If for any reason the startup stops growing or doing well, our investors can renege and get out.   


Well you can guess what happened. It went to my fucking head. I was living larger than life, treating people badly, sleeping nothing, eating nothing... I lost 20kg, destroyed all my friendships, got business partners in debt and destroyed my financial future all because I couldn't let go of the ganj. I was aware of it the whole time but couldn't deal with quitting because of the physical and mental pain of withdrawal when knee deep in serious startup stuff.   


So yes, we lost the remainder of the money. My business partners hate me but are too cordial to tell me that I'm a cunt, they also don't fully understand what went wrong, there were technical issues too that they cant fully grasp. But I know. I know. I'm aware that if I was sober, exercising and taking care of myself, I could have taken that company all the way to exit.   


I got a normal job after 6 months of being suicidal and making attempts on my life, I couldn't live with the gravity of the situation. I last 8 months in that job before my ego takes over and tells me I'm worth so much more so I quit and get back to work on other projects etc... I'd saved enough over those 8 months. Part of me feels like I should be sending every penny I earn to the people who were in the business with me who've lost their bootstrapping funds, but whatever, I'll smash a new startup out and get STACKS... then they'll be thankful :D   


Wrong. I cant maintain routine at home without the dull focus being stoned brings me, I eventually relapse and when lockdown comes around  my use spikes to the point I'm back at previous levels and self-loathing astronomically. I'm also running out of money. I know this isn't right, I can't be back here again. I almost died because of this shit. I start applying for jobs, maybe if I get a good remote gig some routine will take me away from this. I want to contact my ex, I want to get fit and fill out a shirt again, I want love. I'm so alone, the only comfort I get is when I inhale on the devil's lettuce. It's wrong though, and I know that.  


Boom, get offered a job a few weeks later that will pay me almost £60-80k, at 26 that's sweet asf for the UK. Time to clean up my act. I've quit before...   


Welp, it's not that easy... last time I was on a cocktail of drugs for insomnia, depression and anxiety - it was out of the frying pan and into another frying pan - not the fire - as is the case this time. I've been clean only 2-3 days so far and my withdrawal symptoms are debilitating. They include: Stomach Cramps, Nausea, Lack of Appetite, Diarrhea/Loose and frequent bowel movements, Restlessness (I have to go for walks constantly and move around or I just feel in pain), Painful Awareness (I'm having complex thoughts for the first time in forever and god did I forget how NOISY my head is... constantly thinking, noticing, calculating... I started to smoke just to quieten things) are just a few. Oh and the night sweats! Waking up from the best part of a 30 minute sleep and presenting as though you have just been for a swim in your clothes is kinda insane.   


Anyway, here I am 2-3 days in and really excited for this job. I need to get clean and healthy by mid August and I'm throwing myself into this, I won't relapse because I know my livelihood depends on it, but god is it awful. I'm fucking dying and mostly it's just from not being able to eat... literally wasting away. I can stomach about 600 calories a day of really bland veg and fruit, maybe a bit of bread and almond milk, that's it.   


How long can I expect this to go on for? Has anyone had similar symptoms?   


I wrote this all out and it was kinda therapeutic for me because I have never verbalised any of this to anyone, I don't think it'll be that helpful to anyone but I wanted to post something anyway. At least that way when I'm a year in or whatever I can look back and remember how fucking far I've come.   


I'd like to end this with saying that I fully intend to help out the guys who dived in with me (friends) when it was still just an idea and threw money at it, they're all in debt too now. I want to clear that and will continue to live at home in this tiny house with my Mum until I have managed that. Part of me believes that they had agency too, it was their decision, but I can't fucking go to bed at night with this guilt (and withdrawal symptoms) so if not for their sake, for mine lol - I just need to get back to square 1 with everything.   


I hope you manage to quit if you're on this sub, life is so much better when not smoking daily and organising your life around your next hit. Evaluate the excuses you are making and ask why you're smoking and then try to deal with those problems instead of smoking constantly. It is a medicine and in that regard it really needs to be treated with respect, there are certainly people that can manage use in moderation but the vast majority of people just don't have that kind of self control - she's far too sexy and alluring mi ole' mistress cannabis.

I’ve officially gone 1 year without smoking.  I started smoking when I was 16 and was smoking everyday by 18.  I am currently 38 and was 37 when I stopped.  So 20+ years of my life I was a smoker.  I loved weed more than anything and would smoke 10+ times a day.  I honestly never thought I would quit.  

About 3 or 4 years ago I went through a really bad spell of depression and anxiety.  I was drinking and taking pills on top of non stop smoking.  I knew something had to change so I started my journey to become sober.  First thing I tackled was my addiction to benzodiazepines and alcohol.  That was really hard on me physically and mentally but I didn’t stop smoking then.  I needed weed to get me through that time.  After receiving professional help for the pills and alcohol I was ready to tackle the weed.  

I had a 1/8 left when I decided to quit.  I smoked it that weekend and then Monday I just quit cold turkey.  It was a bad week of insomnia and depression and angry out burst for no reason but I can honestly say that first week was the hardest.  Every week after that was slightly easier. 

So here I am a year later.  My anxiety is almost zero.  95% better then it was.  I still feel depressed but not as much and not at such a deep level.  When I was smoking I would have higher highs but also lower lows.  I feel like now I am more balanced.  Things don’t excite me as much but things don’t depress me as much either.  I’ve become very anti social which is total opposite of who I was.  My memory is terrible now.  I can’t remember the order that events of my past happen.  It really feels like Im someone else and everything that happened in the past was someone else’s life.  

Sometimes I think I want to start again but I know I’ll just go back to non stop smoking.  I wish I didn’t feel so strange like a new person but I spent my early adult and adulthood smoking so it’s not surprising I feel so strange in my sobriety.   

Thanks for anyone who took the time to read this and I’ll save this name and password in my browser but can’t promise I’ll be back after today.  Good luck to anyone wanting to stop.",42

2020-07-19 09:46:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hu0qb1/quitting_with_or_without_cigarettes/,Quitting with or without cigarettes?,"Hey guys, 

Has anyone had more or less success quitting when you do it with or without cigarettes? 

In my experience, quitting everything all at once (including alcohol) removes any temptation and tends to mean that I quit for a more sustained period of time. It's also nice to fully rid your body of all toxins so that you feel the full benefits of sobriety. This way I can get back into doing some exercise and realise why being sober and smoke free is so great. 

On the other hand, sometimes I try and quit smoking tobacco and weed at the same time and fall on the first day purely because I want a cig so bad. If I keep cigs for a few days, then this can potentially help me get over the first few days, when the withdrawal symptoms are worse. The downside however, is that if nicotine stays in my body, this inadvertently leads me to think about smoking weed and you know, kinda means that I'm not moving on from smoking psychologically.   


The bottom line is: today, I can either let myself have a few cigs and a beer later to ease the pain of quitting, or, I can go fully drug free and probably have a really shitty day but then feel great tomorrow and probs more heartened that I can do this. It's a tough call. Any suggestions?",2

I'm on day 50.

* I walk better, more upright with better coordination.
* Hair looks healthier. It could also be because I shower more frequently now.
* Less dark circles around eyes and no more bags under them.
* Skin looks healthier.
* When I run I ""catch"" my breath more easily now, as if my lungs cleared (which they probably did to some extent).

Also, my eyelashes are much longer (I'm a guy) which gives a nice conture around the eyes, making them seem more intense in a good way. Anyone else noticed longer eyelashes?",30

Ive smoked weed for idk how many years. Started when I was 14 and have been smoking everyday since i was probably 16... im 22 now so like 6-8 years or so i cant even remember. So I have a few questions.

So firstly, a little background for my mental health, I am not diagnosed because I cant bring myself to get help, doesn't help i have a very dismissive family doctor (also im in Canada BTW). I have really bad anxiety and some depression, I also get really bad panic attacks. I think this all stems from unhealthy coping mechanism since I was so young, which obviously is smoking pot. BUT now I CANT calm down with out it once I get like that. So my first question is did quitting smoking or smoking less help anyone's mental health? and what do you do to help cope with things without weed, i need some suggestions.

Second all my friends (and partner) all smoke pot, but my bf wants to quit or severely cut back with me. I don't want to lose these people tho, they are my best friends and I've had really shitty relationships in my life and I am so happy to finally have a great group of friends. I haven't told them yet cause its only been 1 day. I am not worried they wont accept it, but how do I hangout with them without wanting to smoke?

First and foremost thanks to [**u/The\_C\_Bear**](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_C_Bear/) for recommending this book to me as it has changed my approach and thinking to not just quitting weed but many aspects of my life.

The book I'm referring to is The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson.

A chapter at the beginning of the book really resonated with me and my many breaks / quitting attempts over the 18 years I've smoked.

From the book:

&#x200B;

> When people are looking down the barrel of failure in their lives, they will do whatever it takes to get themselves moving, something, anything, to start climbing upward toward the point of survival. And then, once they get to the point where they’re keeping their heads above water, they start heading back down again. As they start getting close enough to the failure line that they can see it coming, they go, “Whoops, I’m headed towards failure!” and then they do whatever it takes to turn their trajectory around and start heading back up … and the cycle repeats 

&#x200B;

*The forum doesn't let me post images but to go with the above quote imagine three horizontal lines, on top of each other, the bottom line is failure, the middle line survival, the top line success.  Your journey through these three stages is a wave line.*

&#x200B;

I realised that I can apply the above quote to my smoking/quitting habits - I get to the point where I'm smoking too much and am on the failure line, I quit, start to feel better, that I'm getting my life back on track, and I'm moving upwards to the survival line, then I stop doing the thing that is taking me from failure to survival and would take me onward to success i.e. Not smoking. 

I start smoking again, maybe a little at first because hey, I'm not failing anymore right? , so I can smoke, the smoking habit then starts taking me back down to the failure line, after a while at the bottom I then think, shit, I'm failing here again, best stop smoking and the cycle repeats.

&#x200B;

I started thinking about this same pattern and how I repeat this in other areas of my like, at work I get behind (failure) so I start to panic and put some extra hours in to catch up,  I start to feel like I'm in a better place, on top of my work and have moved upwards towards the survival line then I start to slack off again, because hey I'm not failing any more right? so I slowly move back down to the failure line, after a while at the bottom I panic - And the cycle repeats.

&#x200B;

I was in my garage gym the other day and noticed that the same pattern was staring me in the face, written on my whiteboard is this, each number represent 3 sets of 5 reps in KG performed on different days

Bench press: 52.5 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 / 60 / 62.5 / 65 / 70 / 60 / 65 / 67.5 / 70 / 72.5

You can see the pattern I workout, I progress, (52.5kg then 55kg then 60kg then 65kg then 70kg) perhaps I start to see a little muscle, and feel good about myself, I then start to slack off because, hey I'm not failing anymore right?  So I get a little lazy with my gym habit. Take some time off, some time goes by, I start to feel less healthy, think I better get back into that gym habit, and I'm back on the bench, at the same weight I was x weeks/months ago.

&#x200B;

After reading this book, I understand that I'm repeating these patterns in my life and that the key to all this is steadiness and consistency, steadiness and consistency will take me away from the failure line, past the survival line and upwards and onward to the success line, with time, it's inevitable.

If I think of any of these smoking / working / fitness examples I wonder where I could of been by now, if I had just kept up the positive habits that lead me away from the failure line.  That brings regret, but also hope, because I know that all I need to do is to keep the habits that take me away from failure, the very same habits will take me past survival to success, I just need to be steady and consistent.

I know this was a long post, so thank you for reading this far.  The book goes into this and so much more in greater detail I highly recommend this for anyone struggling to understand how they got to where they are now and how to build habits to get to where they want to be.

Thank you for reading.",2

Here's a recap of my Saturday to demonstrate how quickly things revved up in the 24 hours following relapse. I'm wasting my life away while I'm on weed and I mean that in the most literal sense.

Saturday:10:00 A.M - Wake up and purchase a quarter oz despite telling myself that yesterday was a mistake and that it was just a slip-up. ""We were celebrating!"". Also had to buy papers and a lighter cause I threw mine out the last time I said I was 'quitting'.

10:30 A.M - Had my first joint with a cup of coffee down by the lake. Great start to a beautiful summer day. So far so good.

11:00 A.M - Starting to feel hungry, too lazy to make food. Smoke another joint instead.

12:30 P.M - Meet up with a friend that I hadn't seen in a few weeks (because I wasn't smoking) and we smoke 2 fattys together.

2:00 P.M - Holy shit, I still haven't eaten yet! My stomach is killing me. I finally grab a burger from McD's (cause i'm lazy, remember?)

2:30 P.M - Whew. That was a good meal, shall I smoke another one? I think I will.

4:00 P.M - At this point my room mate comes home (They know I'm not supposed to be smoking) so I purposely left the house to get high without them finding out. I shit you not, for the next 2 hours I sat in my car by myself,  getting high. THIS IS WHAT I DECIDED TO DO ON A HOT ASS SUMMER DAY.  I think I browsed reddit and listened to a couple podcasts too so atleast I have that going for me. 

6:30 P.M. - Room mate invites me out to a BBQ. I politely decline because I've been smoking non-stop since 10 in the morning and I'm not even sure I'm alive at this point. Room mate is curious as to why I'm so low energy today, I tell him ""I'm just burnt out, it's been a long week."" Instead I mindlessly played games on my phone for the next 3 hours. DID I MENTION HOW FRICKEN BEAUTIFUL IT IS OUTSIDE?

9:30 P.M - Oh shit, I haven't eaten since 2, lets munch on some Taco Bell. But lets smoke one first.

10:00 P.M - And after.

12:00 A.M - Open up my baggie to see that I only have a nug and some shake left at the bottom. At this point I realize that I smoked a quarter to myself (almost) in one day. I'm overcome by grief and regret, and swear that after this one last  joint, I'm done.

12:15 A.M  - Got high for the ""last time""

3:00 A.M - Browsing Leaves and trying to muster up the strength and willpower to leave this shit behind for good.

&#x200B;

As embarrassing as it is, days like this aren't all that uncommon for me. I prioritize weed over everything whenever I go on these little benders. I'm out here lying to people, starving myself, sitting in my car doing fuck all for extended periods of time just so I can get high.  I can't keep 'living' like this.

Day 0 again. Fuck me.",1156

Here is my story.,"I smoked everyday at least once since I was 18 (I'm 31 going on 32 now).  I always laughed off any suggestions it was a problem because I mean, come on, it's just weed right!?  Then all of a sudden I started wanting to do more with my life.  Working on writing or making videos specifically, and being high made it damn near IMPOSSIBLE to focus on anything.  I don't have the strongest attention span to begin with which is why I have sadly accomplished so little in my 30+ years on this earth.  I began to cut back hoping I could just ease off of it, I even tried to make it a reward system for myself (work on something for at least two hours and you can smoke a bowl, that sort of thing).  

Then something happened I never thought would...I had a panic attack from smoking...like full blown nervous breakdown.  I just started looking back on my life thus far and feeling like an utter failure, at 31 years old I had nothing to hang my hat on, no accomplishments worth noting, every business or creative endeavor I'd ever started ended up failing because I wouldn't put the work it to make it succeed.  And to be honest with all of you I just broke down, my girlfriend was an absolute angel about the whole thing and helped me through it (she suffers from anxiety so she's all too familiar with panic attacks) and after about 2 hours I finally calmed down and regained control of myself.  From that moment I vowed I would never touch it again; I don't think weed is evil or anything but it has clearly gotten to a point where it's no longer something for me.  It's been about a week since that happened and I have no desire to turn back.  

The side effects suck; my dreams are terrifyingly vivid and I remember every single part of them now, I can't focus on anything yet because my mind is racing all over the place.  I'm  going back to the gym starting Monday and I downloaded a meditation app at my friend's suggestion.  I know it's going to be a while before I get used to being sober all the time but there's no doubt in my mind I'm making the right decision.  The only downside is my username feels a little ironically silly now lol but it is what it is.  Glad to have found this group and to know I'm not the only one who has went through something like this.  I know a week isn't much but it's a milestone that feels great to me and I'm looking forward to the day where just going 7 days doesn't seem like a big deal anymore.  Thanks for reading and if any of you guys and gals have some advice to help me through the ""this really sucks"" phase of quitting I'm all ears!",4

Can I consume weed in moderation? I think the answer is different for everyone but I can share the story of moderation as it applies to. It always plays out as such:

0. Deep in the habit. Smoke/eat weed every day. Life is a haze. huh.. why did I start weed in the first place? I never wanted it to be like this. I really feel like I've lost control. What do I do? I'm so sick and tired of this life but I need weed. It's the only thing helping me.. I need help. Start lurking /r/leaves, reading blogs, but still smoking and eating weed. Self loathing at an all time high.

1. No! Enough is enough! I hate my habit, I will quit, throw shit out. Let's do this!! Start posting on /r/leaves, reading through peoples stories, get inspired. This time is it! I know it! Oodles of determination are flowing through my body!

2. Go through withdrawal, hate it, power through with the help of gracious strangers. It's mental hell but it's doable physically. The tiniest inkling of confidence starts coming back. Maybe I can be free after all? No no, what am I even thinking..

3. Come out the other side of withdrawal.. A few weeks go by.. I'm engulfed in the pink cloud. Feeling amazing for X months. To ground this in reality, I've only actually ever stayed away for 6 months in the last decade. But at this point, Life is the best. Hahaha, I fooled myself into thinking weed has control over me! But it sooo doesn't! This was so easy! I can quit anytime, because look I just did. I'm X weeks in and no one can stop me from living a better life. Weed truly does not have power over me. Confidence is at an all time high.

4. Sober life is chugging along and I feel free of weed. Suddenly, an opportunity presents itself like a sirens song. A birthday, an old friend, a pretty girl at a party that wants to light up with me. Something comes along and taps the gentlest tap on my sobriety's door. Hello old friend? Remember me? Remember all the fun we had? Remember that one time you smoked 8 years ago, and had one of the best experiences of your life? I can make it happen again. Just one time? Remember how fun it can be in moderation like you used to do when you first met me? Hmm.. well this is just this one opportunity right? I pick that as an arbitrary occasion to 'celebrate' because ultimately lets be honest here, the best moments only get better with weed right? I'm having so much fun, I'm out the other side of the daily habit, I haven't smoked in so long so my tolerance is low (a part of me is secretly looking forward to this but won't admit it out loud). I deserve this to be honest, I've been so good.

5. Have that celebration and realize OMG I FUCKING LOVE WEED AND NOTHING ELSE CAN REPLACE THAT FEELING. How could I have quit totally? This should be a part of life somehow. I mean, just objectively speaking, I'm perfectly alright, I've quit already, I can totally control it as I just demonstrated in the past few months. Let's take things easy and structured this time, ok? Let's just treat it like a vacation. Once every few months, everyone deserves some time off, and this is my time off.

6. Addict brain kicks in but I want to be sober. Sober life has been pretty great. (But not as great as that weed high you have right? come on, don't lie, you love that feeling and miss it. Let's do it sometimes, but this whole vacation analogy is stupid. It's more like happy hour! Every few weeks with just friends right, people drink like that all the time, come on) .. Hmm.. Ok. The negotiation begins. What's the next acceptable celebration? Pick another arbitrary date, but this time it's not months away, it's weeks away. Then it comes and passes, another celebration gets picked even sooner. The months are down to weeks. Oh no.. Am I back on the road? The confidence in my sober self begins to crack. Weed is back in town and I just can't resist how she makes me feel. I need to see her every now and then.

7. Soon it's every weekend because I need to relax after the week of work. I know it's a bit much compared to total sobriety, but it's the weekend! All my friends drink on the weekends, why can't I just smoke on the weekends? Weed is better than alcohol anyway. I think this can work out, plus I have so much wisdom this time from the so many times I quit before. I can moderate. I will set a hard limit now. ONLY WEEKENDS ok? That rule is not going to be broken, I put my foot down.

8. Something happens at work or home. A hard Tuesday. A boring Thursday. A painful Monday. But very soon it's daily because.. I need to unwind after work and this feeling is just soooo good.. isn't it? What wrong am I doing anyway? I was already smoking fri/sat/sun. This is just a few more days. Plus weed doesn't give me hangovers. Negotiations give way to bargaining and coercion. Thoughts start devolving. Gone are the negotiations around how good it is. Now my thoughts spiral and start feeling rather how bad it's not. I'm not hurting myself or others. I'm not stealing. I'm not doing heroine. It's just weed ok? Leave me alone! I don't care that it's daily. It's just how I do it. And all the while, the rational brain loses more and more ground, till it's gagged and thrown into the basement. Weed moves into my apartment at this point and no one else matter. She's my queen.

9. Why wait till after work though? The day is so long. I can't believe I didn't realize how long 24 hours can be... Ugh... work is so stressful, I'm just going to start toking a bit before work. Just a bit, not enough to make me slow, but enough to relax me. Guilt starts piling up. I know on some deep human level, this isn't ok. Something is wrong. In fact, something is terribly terribly wrong. Am I losing it again? Where's my moderation now? I live with weed and she calls the shots. Moderation is an illusion of the past. Weed is my queen and even if I want out, I have no power.

10. How did I get here? I'm waking up with headaches. I'm spending all my spare money. I promised moderation so well. I had a plan. I only wanted to use weed moderately. What did I do wrong? Realize I hate weed and it's control over me.. Haze is everywhere. Nothing is fun without weed. Nothing is fun without weed.. nothing is fun without weed... nothing is fun without weed..But there she is. She's still my queen but I hate every thing about her. 

11. Loathing, anxiety and guilt are at an all time high. Every day is a mixture of a couple of supremely anxious sober and mostly loathsome hazy hours. Even the thrill of getting the next hit is gone, because it's hits all the time but they don't matter. Nothing matters. Life is this again and I'm back at step 0... but where did I go wrong.. I was supposed to moderate.

As I stand again at Step 0 (today is day 1 of another quitting cycle for me), I realize I'm caught in a loop. Something, maybe my body, maybe my past, but something compels me to always be negotiating, always be looking for a bit more fun, a bit more relaxation. And weed is the perfect substance to take small harmless steps with, till it's your whole life and you never wanted that in the first place.

I don't know about you, but in my heart I know I don't want to go back. But here I sit 10 years an addict, with only ever having done 6months of sobriety, on yet another day 1.

I started to cough up brown probably about 3 weeks ago and thats what made me completely stop. I was ripping the bong or hitting dabs every 15 minutes. Since, in the past week ive been to the ER  3 times, urgent care once, and my family doctor twice. I've been feeling very very sick and light headed. I've been also coughing up more and more brown and dark brown which is what is making me keep running to the ER. I've also been having digestion problems, bowel movement problems, mental problems, sleep problems.. you name it. Is this normal? Could this all be from withdrawl and detoxing and flushing all the toxins out of me? I've hardly been able to eat or keep anything down and just felt completely shitty - Muscle pains throughout my body. I feel like I'm literally dying and everytime I see the mucus it sends me into a panic. Only smoked for about a year and a half but very heavy use I'm 19. I'm on day 7 or 8 but same symptoms",8

The last 5 years I’ve smoked almost everyday. It got to the point where I would smoke before doing any activity. I would smoke before and after a shower, to cook, to eat, to read, to watch tv, to sleep, etc. I don’t even really feel a high anymore- it’s like I’m smoking to feel normal.

It’s really been affecting me and after talking to a few friends (one of whom pointed me here) I decided to stop. This past Monday I got rid of everything and quit. I’m trying my hardest to stick with it.

I’ve had trouble eating, my mood is terrible and I’ve been so tempted but my main problem is- I can’t sleep. The last couple of days I’ve finally fall asleep around 5 or 6 am. I’ve tried taking a shower, tea, meditation, rain sounds, and even counting sheep. Nothing is working. I turn off all the lights and just lay there for hours unable to sleep. It’s really been messing with me- I wake up in the morning exhausted and keep falling asleep while I should be working. 

I’m not sure what I thought would happen when I quit. For me weed always relaxed me but it also made me so complacent with doing nothing for long periods or time. I think I thought when I quit it would be easier to focus and I would get back my energy and resolve to do things.

I know it’s only been a couple days and I’m trying to stick with it but it’s been a really shitty week. Can’t sleep, appetite is pretty much gone, I feel groggy and tired all the time, yet I can’t turn my brain off. Sometimes I’ll lose track of time thinking about nothing for hours.

If anyone has gone through something similar, I would so appreciate any advice on what worked for you and what helped you stick with it.",2

I’m trying to quit so that I can go to school and be mentally there full time so I don’t screw my life up before it starts.

 These past few years of college I’ve just been slacking and smoking weed whenever I can. Failing some classes, barely passing others. Self esteem seemed to drop every time I smoked a bowl and I guess the guilt of what I’m doing to myself finally caught up to me and I said enough. 

However the urge to smoke is so so great for me. I’d probably have relapsed by now if I didn’t throw everything away. How do you guys get though the first month?

A week in it seems like my emotions are all over the place. It seems like one day I’m feeling really good about myself and then the next day I’m checked out and depressed, and then the next day I’m happy and good to go again, rinse and repeat. It’s driving me insane.",5

Like some days you're scared of even looking people in the eyes, other days you become the highlight of the party. This change can happen during a single week, which is why I doubt I'm bipolar (since I heard manic periods go on for weeks or months, not days, but I could be wrong though).

On a sidenote, feeling up or down seems to depend on previous interactions. For example, if someone made me upset I would feel really down for several days. If I had a good time, I would feel really great instead and my confidence would skyrocket. My mood amplifies like a ripple effect whether I had a good or bad interaction.

Sooo, I’m kind of a habitual relapser at this point. I quit (again) in April and stopped until some time last month. The thing that keeps getting me is the sleep deprivation. For some reason, my weed withdrawal insomnia seems to last for about 6 weeks. No matter what, after the first week or so of being clean, I’m only able to get about 5 hours a night on any given night. It’s not enough for me to function and it makes me feel miserable honestly. I want to quit again, so, so bad, but I’m scared of feeling like I did last month. 

Do I just need to white knuckle it and get through that month or two of sleepless nights? 

Does anyone else experience this level of withdrawal related insomnia? 

Also, yes, people have told me to taper off or moderate my usage, but I’m a full fledged addict and all or nothing is kinda how my brain is wired.

I'm 20 and nothing I've tried so far has completely dissolved my anxiety like weed has. I instantly feel happy, outgoing, and comfortable. After taking a 2-month break during quarantine (forced, living with parents) I went right back into it when I started seeing friends again. However, I noticed a big difference once I started to pick up my smoking and get my tolerance back up. During quarantine I was constantly productive, I'd see how I could improve myself in the future and I'd put the work in to get to that point. Since then, I've stopped doing hard workouts, stopped searching for an internship next summer, and I've been riddled with anxiety and insecurities when I'm sober.

I'm sick of it. I'm sick of focusing my day around smoking. I'm sick of lazily rolling out of bed at 1pm. I'm sick of feeling like half a person when I'm sober. 

I like drinking occasionally, I'll vape or smoke a cig every so often. I objectively don't like either as much as weed, but neither alcohol nor nicotine leaves me as depressed as when I'm addicted to weed daily.

Maybe weed is just too perfect for my own good... but I think it's time I seriously step away and live without weed for a while.",58
2020-07-18 14:39:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/htlnfz/day_4_been_smoking_daily_on_and_off_since_17_it/,"Day 4. Been smoking daily on and off since 17. It destroyed my memories, made me lazy, and made me miss out on so many experiences so I'd have time to smoke by myself. It's time to move on.","Junior year of high school, I read some reddit posts about what weed is like, and it piqued my interest. I'd always been interested in philosophy / introspection, and the descriptions of all the interesting thoughts it gave people and how it made music sound so much better made me really curious, so I asked a stoner friend if I could join them for a sesh after school one day. We smoked in the woods behind school, and afterwards he gave me a baggy with probably 1-2 g in it which I took home. 

Essentially every night since then, I would go take a shower late at night after people went to bed and smoke the tiniest little bit of the weed out of an apple and blow it out the window so my family wouldn't smell it, and I truly just had an incredible experience each time. Very psychedelic -- I'd take a shower and feel like I could see my surroundings with my eyes closed, just with everything being only dark blue contours, and I could hear music in my head and it felt like the universe moved to the beat.

It wasn't all sunshine and roses though, and that trippy, magical feeling was always accompanied by paranoia that my parents would find out, and debilitating social anxiety. I couldn't even text anyone because I just would get so anxious if someone needed something from me after I smoked.

This continued all through high school, extending to obtaining weed from pretty risky places so I could continue my habit. Got various paraphernalia: a bowl, a bong, a bubbler, a vape, all kept in my childhood bedroom where I would smoke nightly. I was a smart kid and I ordered a bunch of large military-grade gas mask filters that I'd exhale into, and aside from a few times when I messed up and my sibling noticed late at night, I think I did a surprisingly good job of evading detection despite smoking across the hall from my parents every night. 

Over time I became racked with guilt about this, and was virtually unthinkable to ever get caught by my parents. At the time, I thought the shame of getting caught would have killed me at the spot. I sort of figured it was an inevitability, yet I kept on smoking every night, falling into an intricate ritual of minimizing detection and eliminating the evidence, down to how I would delicately wrap up all my accoutrements in paper towels and hide them after each sesh. The ritualistic aspect of it became comforting, and I became a bit addicted to the adrenaline rush of breaking the rules and risking getting caught every night.

When I got to college, I was determined to stop smoking so I could focus on studying and be able to make friends easier, but inevitably I ended up buying a q from the stoner down the hall, and I was back. Every night, having to ""go to bed"" and leave my friends hours earlier than usual, just so I could vape by myself, in my blank, cell-like dorm room, and escape into the internet where I wouldn't have to think too much about what I was doing to myself. The social anxiety about ""getting caught"" that had been ingrained in me since high school was so bad that I couldn't even get myself to go to the bathroom before bed. I would just fall asleep uncomfortable every night and got used to it.

When I would go home for breaks, the first thing I'd do if I didn't have some at home was to hit up that first guy I ever smoked with and buy a bit more weed, enough to numb me nightly through those paltry few weeks I'd get to spend with my loving family.

I've ""quit"" many times before, but I always went back. As soon as I own weed, I just will smoke it daily. I can't control it. It's gotten to the point where I ""go to bed"" early without my girlfriend so I can have 3 hours by myself to escape into weed and ignore my life and reality. 

I feel like I am lying to the people I love. I'm done with it. It's not a harmful thing on its own, but it is incredibly addictive for me, and it's been eating up hours of my day, nearly every day, since I was 17 years old. I can't go on like this. I've always told myself that I'm young and it's OK to be a bit irresponsible when I'm young and that I'll naturally end up stopping when I get older, but the older I get, the more I can see that unless I make the active decision to stop, I will continue the same pattern till the day I die.

I want to be a good partner to my girlfriend. I want to do well in my job. I want to lose weight and get in shape. I want to enjoy the things I used to be passionate about rather than opt for just thinking about them while I smoke my life away. I want to spend my precious time as a young person with my friends and girlfriend at night rather than wasting any more precious hours of my life on something that I barely remember the next morning anyway. I want to dream again. I want to get a good night's sleep and actually feel rested in the morning. I want to be more confident and sharp. I want to be able to remember what I did the next day without it just seeming like all the days just blur together.

Now that I’m out of that living situation, I feel like my relationship with cannabis has run it’s course. I was afraid of the idea at first, but over time I actually began to feel excited and happy about quitting. However now that I’m actually quitting it’s a lot less exciting.

Over the last year I was smoking at least 1.5g of leaf plus hash (daily). I never thought I'd make it this far. I'm so proud of myself and this is the only place I can be honest about those numbers.,"I hope it's ok to share my story, I wanted to post to share my success so far. For the other posters on here who think they're too far down the rabbit hole to ever see the sun again - we can do this. 

I've been lurking on this subreddit for months (honestly years), devouring the posts trying to find hope, I guess. As the title says I've realised I have never been honest with myself or anyone else about those numbers.

I promised myself I would quit weed on my 30th birthday. It lasted for the week I was away celebrating with my family and then I fell straight back into the smokey haze when my flatmate offered me a toke on my return. I had my first joint at 15 (32F) and casually smoked joints/bongs for the next 9 years on and off to ~~cope with~~ escape my depression, anxiety and what I'd later discover was un-diagnosed ADHD. When my depression/anxiety continued it's downhill crash at 24, MJ became my crutch. 

I kept telling myself I would take a break and then quit next month... spoiler alert, I couldn't even make it a few days unless I planned a vacation to a place I couldn't smoke. Eventually I made excuses not to go on trips. 

It's been 2 years since that one week break. Not a single day went by that I didn't partake up until a couple of weeks ago.

I live in a country that only allows medicinal use, and I don't qualify. When coronavirus isolation became a reality, you'd think the supply would dry up. It didn't. I just smoked more and more at home all the time. My flatmate was home too smoking up a storm. After 3 solid months of this, the mistakes at work became more frequent (working from home). ""Personal hygiene"" were just two words in the dictionary to me. My friends are used to my mental health struggles and are dealing with their own in isolation so no one really noticed as I completely disconnected from the world. 

The only proper care happening was for my two cats. Late one evening I sobered up enough to realise they were howling and it had been happening on and off all day. They were crying because I was too high to clean their litter trays for two days (and now one of my kitties had done his business on floor understandably, the other one had missed his medication). Their water bowls were empty and they hadn't had dinner the day before or breakfast and dinner that day. I hadn't eaten or showered in those two days either. I didn't care about me but I would do *anything* for my furbabies and this fuck up was the last straw. 

I ugly cried as I cleaned up the mess. I sat on the kitchen floor with them as they ate their food and drank the biggest gulps of water and I told them over and over how sorry I was their Mumma had failed them like this and I would never, ever let it happen again. **I have kept my word**. 

Even with a flatmate smoking daily (and I can SMELL where that stash is). I haven't smoked. 

They've offered me a toke multiple times and I said no (even though I said please don't, but that's a whole other story. I have nowhere to move to in the middle of a pandemic). I smoked cigarettes for the first 12 days to cope, but I've switched to lozenges to deal with the nicotine withdrawal from the weed/nicotine tokes. (The constant coughing was starting to attract the 'she's probably got corona looks' from strangers.)

I'm so embarrassed it took neglecting my pets to get to this point. I can't even articulate how utterly ashamed I am that this is the reason I finally had the strength to even get to two weeks without weed.

But, I'm proud and astonished I've made it this far.

I didn't expect this to be an essay, sorry for the self-indulgent rant, but if you've read this far thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. Hopefully it provided a distraction for another 10 minutes or gave you a little hope that you can get through another day sober.

**TL:DR -** I've smoked daily for 8 years and tried to give up or take t-break (unsuccessfully) more times than I can count on both hands. After royally fucking up my duty to my pets and neglecting my own health for far too long, I've managed to stay sober for 16 days. My housemate is still smoking and I've still resisted temptation. 

If I can get through this, you can too.

It doesnt even not make me sad anymore, if anything it's just a numbed sadness. Everytime I quit or go without smoking for weeks, I feel good. At least I feel good enough where I wont want to smoke again, but then i always end up buying and the cycle continues. All my friends smoke so everytime we hang out it's hard to stay sober just cause it's such a ritualistic thing. Even though because of quarantine we really havent been hanging out much, so it's just me smoking by myself.

I just want to share my story if that is OK?

I have been a user for over 14 years. daily user. Mainly started because life as it was, was so boring and dull. Smoking weed made everything i did so much more interesting. I flung my bachelor studies about 10 years ago, for various reasons.  I have been working in different shitty jobs where i always felt "" to good"" and ""to smart"" to do this job. This made me only smoke more and more and consolidated my addiction. I Also started growing my own weed, wich only made me smoke more.

Recently I did got my bachelor degree in electronics/ICT.  Something i love doing and really looking forward to be a professional coder. Weed helped me out alot with studying and coding, and coping with various problems arround me, i thought.  Having my degree really took the ""reason to smoke"" away from me. So I quit 5 days ago.

But damn it has been a hell of a ride the last days. When i wake up I feel somber untill the early afternoon. I really do not have any appetite yet. I wait untill i starve and then after a few bites i have a full stomach feeling. I Can only hope this will fade away soon. 

luckely my wife is very supporting on my journey and takes care of our two beautifull sons when i am down. Also this sub and the quitting-app helped me alot by understanding what is happening in my body and mind. Thank you all for all the support i allready got from just lurking on this sub.

As a kid I always had trouble falling asleep. It may take an hour to fall asleep but I'd still sleep a healthy amount. With weed I'd be out in 10 min easy. 

A light switch went off in my head 5 days ago and I gave it up cold turkey. I want to get a new engineering job and I'm doing this to open up possibilities. You know drug tests and all that.  Im so strong willed and have absolute zero temptation even living with my girlfriend who still smokes daily. I JUST grew my first hydro and I have six quart sized jars of it but it doesn't bother me one bit. I'm very proud of myself in this regard! And mentally I feel absolutely AMAZING and I have lots of energy during the day! 

BUT I CANT SLEEP. I feel I've tried every trick in the book but I don't drift away to sleep land. Im extremely tired at night, but I may get only an hour or two of poor sleep per night. Even so, I remain positive during the day. 

I'm not going back to smoking even though it would solve my sleep issue. The push goes on! When do I go see a doctor? I don't want addictive sleep pills. I understand sleep loss is common but DAMN 😁 I've been so dependant and my brain has obviously forgotten how to do this on its own. Melatonin and zzzquil and camomile tea didnt help. Sex didn't help. Doing lots of physical activity during the day didn't help. Getting out of bed didn't help. I've tried every trick I found online. 

This a great community and I'd appreciate any advice anyone may have! Anyone have similar extreme sleep loss? What did you do?

Thank you!",4

Today I got a lot of shit off my chest with a friend and practically broke down explaining how tough this journey has all been and how low I’ve been feeling. Afterwards I started to feel a lot better and spent some time with my family and my girlfriend whom I’m so lucky for, they are the best things in my life by an infinite mile.

I decided to try to turn this into a positive by raising as much money as I can for MIND, a non-profit charity here in the UK that helps people with mental health issues, something really close to my heart. (Sadly I have some friends that committed  suicide in the past and the facilities and organisations here in the UK are heavily underfunded)

I won’t post anything here because that’s not what this sub and post is about but I will say that it has given me something completely selfless to focus on and I’d recommend doing something similar to others.

In terms of withdrawals, the anxiety and depression are somewhat eleviated but are still noticeably there. There is light at the end of the tunnel and I think it’s because I’m setting some selfless and positive goals I have that little drive I thought would never come.

Remember guys, it’s all good to not be OK, seek out a shoulder to cry on whether it’s a friend, a healthcare service or from an organisation; quitting weed is tough as hell and you’re not alone, we’re in this together.

I had my dog with me, and for some reason I just didn't think to grab his leash when we walked out the door. 9/10 times he would have just walked right to my car. Well this was that 10%. He saw a rabbit, chased it into the road, and was hit by a car. Literally the only car around came at that exact moment. It feels like the universe punishing me for being careless. I feel terrible. That night was the worst night of my life.

 People tell me not to blame myself but I know that he'd be alive right now if I had just been more careful. I can't say for sure that if I was sober I would have grabbed his leash, but I probably would have. I loved him so much and my girlfriend loved him even more, and now she'll never see him again. I fucked up- It was my responsibility to protect him and I didn't even do the most basic thing of keeping him on the leash.

I've been a daily smoker for years, but for two weeks after that I didn't smoke weed at all. But I slowly started again. I feel like smoking helped bring out some emotions that I wanted to repress, which was good, I think. 

I feel like this was a sign and a terrible lesson that I need to get my shit together. But I still have cravings. Smoking weed was how I relaxed. I used to love getting high then playing with him or taking him on a walk. 

 It's Friday afternoon and I just wanna get high. But I know I shouldn't. There's so much I want to accomplish and weed just slows me down.


Idk what the point of this post is. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading

Yes, I used to see my vices as virtues, especially my harsh cannabis misuse. What a tool I was, feigning psychosis and the abuse of my own mind for the so called pursuit of ‘higher consciousness’. It all ended in a psychotic episode that lasted 2 days in an emergency room for mentally unstable patients. What I learnt from all this is that 'higher consciousness' for me will come from what I cultivate in my own mind, my well-founded beliefs, spiritual practices, the use of my intellect, and the need of sobering philosophy. Elevation, in my experience, will be given by my own thoughts and judgments, especially those that make me stronger and kinder, not by a externals, not by quelling my anxiety by using cannabis. Moreover, what I ended up learning was that cannabis will never make me more critically able, nor it will never 'expand my consciousness' to boundaries that are useful, for that, hard work is needed for my part and virtue is a steep mountain to climb to redeem my own humanity.

As in my case, psychedelic drugs made me only stupefied, disconnected with sober reality and bogus about my own beliefs. I used to see my vices as virtues, but that does not mean that other people should not have the liberty to 'medicate' themselves if they so choose to word it. For me it was doom, addiction and illusion, wasted time on something that never made me a better man.

I started medicating my own anxiety, depression and many other ailments by first establishing in my own life the importance of routine, physical and mental well-being, followed by making my mind stronger and better. I sought knowledge and decided to use my own intellect. I have faith now. All this progress I owe it to philosophy, the ever-loving and giving companion, the mistress that never takes but gives. Liberty is a double-edged sword, be aware of what you want and how it will affect yourself and society. I will never see my vices as virtues ever again. I wish you all a good character before everything you feel, think and do. Much love to everyone.",3

It was easy to get off opiates because I had weed and now I feel like I have nothing to help with getting off weed? Do I taper down or do I go cold turkey? I eat a lot of edibles and use cartridges, I don't really smoke it anymore but edibles probably do worse damage.

I started smoking weed when I was 17. I am soon 27 and been smoking more or less every day for the past 7 years, and getting really tired of trying to quit and failing so many times over and over.

I tried finding support in friends, maybe I am afraid to admit to them that I am an addict (yes I admit to myself that I am addicted to weed, as I early lost control of myself in the haze).

I tried councelling, talking to professionals that are there as a support for quitting addiction. 

I have been to rehab when I was younger. 

I still find myself in this hopeless cycle that I can’t escape, I have tried so many times.

I am quite lonely, which has been a reason of my smoking in the first place. So I know a lot of it has to do with quitting ”alone”, it’s way harder to kick it off by yourself with no one really to talk about the struggle.

Anyways

I stumbled upon this forum and felt completely enlightened by this large community that works as a support for people trying to quit. I have stayed up all night long reading posts and comments, and find so much motivation and support from anonymous users writing about their own struggles quitting. 

I have found a form of strength that I couldn’t find elsewhere, and it’s thanks to all of you.

Just wanted to put that out, and also I believe posting this will subconciously give me a kick in the ass to stand up and deal with this mess I have created for myself.

Here I am again, trying. I am starting my 3rd day without smoking. So basically I have been awake for the two past days unable to sleep at night.

Still not smoked. Just realised though , the things I normally do in dead time like lulls at work and after work include Scrolling Instagram , Reddit , YouTube , has been replaced now sober. 

Out of boredom I applied to new jobs last night , actually played Xbox and tried to sweat and win , opened a account with a brokerage and bought some shares , mainly for fun. Looked how I could possibly get a roof rack on my car so I could get a kayak and go kayaking and fishing. Looking for cool ideas for next date night with the Mrs. Aaaaand came up with a new training split and worked out. Oh , and I cooked dinner. Normally I'd just have like a protein shake a banana and some oats or something because cba to cook cus I wna get baked. 

So yea , I just find myself more wanting to improve my real life for the future rather than just trying to make the most of now and disregarding my future self",38

I love how I feel when I’m high, but I have become a different person. 

I’m a lot less productive, outgoing, and energetic. I’ve spent way too much money. I find I daydream a lot about all the things I want to do with my life but am too high to pursue anything. 

I think the biggest factor is I’m scared that I won’t be able to handle emotions without having weed to fall back on. I have pretty severe anxiety, and tend to cry/break down when I get stressed or mad. I feel like I’m kinda a weak person so when my anxiety gets bad or I get really stressed or depressed life is so boring. Weed makes boring things seem interesting, but the way I’m using it isn’t good. I can tell. 

So many times I think I need to stop but then I look it up and am bombarded with how much weed is not addictive. I get it’s psychological but I don’t know how to go about this. I didn’t even know other people talked about this I just found this sub",4

My anxiety is also quite high and affecting my digestion (think IBS) 

I know I was expecting symptoms but wondering if anyone with similar symptoms around this time knows what the time line looks like? And how I can ease it? Or is it a case of everyone is different. I still have to go to work and do night shifts so really have to sleep :-/

I thought it was cool and everything seemed great cause you were always laughing with your friends and no worries... 10 years later I feel like I've lost my personality, I don't have any deep relationships with anyone including my family.. I just feel so lost and hopeless sometimes I don't really want to blame weed for everything its definitely my own choices that led me up to this. But I've made it 10 days sober and am super proud of myself but man is it super hard when you don't have any close friends or you just feel super alone sometimes. I've noticed some improvements in my mood though and actually crave going out to connect with people now and just be outside instead of staying inside by myself smoking weed and playing games all night.. I also started getting back into my guitar which is awesome but still get discouraged sometimes cause guitar and singing is not an easy task and I would always smoke weed when I got discouraged. I have always relapsed in the past cause whenever I start feeling good I tell myself maybe it's okay just to do it in moderation but that never happens. I really need to get in touch with my sober self and need to focus on loving myself again to a point where I'm okay being alone. Because things change people always leave, friends come and go..

Not because I think there’s anything wrong with occasional use, it’s no worse than the occasional glass of wine. It’s not an option because it makes the rest of the time when I’m not smoking so much more difficult. 

I enjoy it so much that if I do it on the weekend I’ll wake up every weekday and just think about the next time I can smoke. I’ll crave it constantly and I’ll slowly start smoking more and more frequently. That isn’t the case when I completely quit, I pretty quickly stop thinking about it constantly and I becomes not a big deal to not smoke. 

So if you’re committed to not smoke every day and you’re like me, you might find it (counter intuitively) much easier to just not smoke at all.",22

Been trying to quit since 2011. (Kinda lengthy)","Hello. I wish to share my story with anyone willing to listen in hopes that it may help them not feel alone with the struggles of quitting and also hopefully sharing will help me too.

I started smoking when I was 19. I had recently drop out of college do to my roommate moving out of our place, leaving me not able to find a place to live. I’m from West Virginia and we where going to school in Pittsburgh and I’d only been there 8 months so I didn’t really know anyone to move in with and couldn’t afford to live alone. I moved back to WV with plans of enrolling in a college near home. When I first got back I wanted to reconnect with my friends i haven’t seen since High school ended.

In high school I smoked pot once on my first day of my senior year and loved it, but not once was I like  “ I should do this all the time!”. 98% of the people I hung out with didn’t do any drugs, I was a punk/emo/skater kid and music and friends where really all I needed. But when I returned back home from college it’s like a memo went of to everyone I knew that read “ so schools over...Now what? Oh I know..let’s Get High!” 

Few buddies of mine I’d been friends with since grade school heard I was back and stop by my place to catch up. Soon after arriving one of them says “you guys wanna go to the ax murders?”I naturally was like “not really”. And they laughed and said trust us. We drive out too the woods and pull off road to park under some trees( it’s like 11pm) and it turns out this was the ax murders spot and they just called it that cause it was dark and scary lol. I’m sitting there like yeah guys this is... cool I guess lol then I hear “well not yet it’s not”then my buddy hands me a pipe in the back seat. I had know idea how it worked. I’d only smoked from a pop can before. So we smoked and it was great, I had a great time. Then the next day they stop by again....to do the same thing. 

Before I knew it, it was every night. But I didn’t have any reason to believe that it was harmful in anyway.
Then before I knew it I was getting my own stuff and my place be came the new “spot” due to me living in my dads basement and him not caring. 
First year all fun, but by the time the 2nd year rolled around id become hooked. 

I Couldnt go to work without getting high first, couldn’t do anything without getting high first.
I stop for like 3 days a few times then would be like I’m good now I’ll go back to smokeing.

Then in 2012 I had a nervous break down and ended up in the hospital. I was put in a psychiatric ward with mental heath patients and recovery addicts. But I was considered a MH patient. I brought up that I couldn’t stop smoking weed and doctors said I’m not a recovery patient so they couldn’t really get me the help I  actually NEEDED. Instead I was told I was depressed and may have ptsd from childhood events. And when I told the addicts I was addicted to weed the opening mocked me and told me THATS NOT POSSIBLE! them all being there for eather pills of alcohol and said I was just weak.. and that crushed my sprit. 

I got out of the hospital feeling completely hopeless. The meds made me numb and wanna Kill myself so I quit taking them and just went back to my old ways cause It was IMPOSSIBLE for me to have a problem, I just liked weed... 

Between that time and now (it’s 2020 and I’m 31 ) I’ve been hospitalized 6 more times with 3 suicide attempts for the same problem but sense my experience the first time in the hospital I never tell them it’s cause I can’t stop smoking. I’ve tried so many times and as I type this I’m currently trying again, been clean now for a full 12 hours! Woohoo! 😔 

I’ve wasted so much time and money, I straight up spent probably like 200,000 dollars on weed and i currently have no saving and are unemployed. I’m just fortunate to have any amazing wife who puts up with my crap and understands I’m not a bad guy, I’m just in a bad place (mental). I now think my use stems from my fear of not knowing how life works with weed. I’m so f’n scared of the boredom and withdraws, I just can’t find meaning without it.
But I’m hear to say I’m trying again. Probably for the 758th time... but trying none the less 

Thank you for your time
I wish all the luck and strength in the world.",1

Well it turned out that the screening wasn’t eve going to happen but during that time I realized what has been holding me back all these years. I don’t know how long I’ve been clean but I know I know its over a month. I am much happier and productive. No more mood swings. I feel like my misophonia has become better too. I’m glad I quit and I didn’t even do it on purpose. I guess I’m posting this in case anyone else needs the motivation, but mostly its for me. It just feels nice to write it out. I wouldn’t change a thing about the last 17 years but I’m happy with the way things are headed. Anyway, seeing how happy him and his wife are and seeing that there’s more to life than being high all day has also really helped.

The worst part for me were dabs. At one point, I was smoking dabs during the work day at a nearby dab cafe. I’d come back stoned telling myself it helped me work, which wasn’t true, and I’d end up playing Rome total war for the remainder of the day.

We probably lost out on months of potential productivity in this time as I was implying relying on my team doing work, with myself only doing much in the morning. I quit dabs, but then jumped back in heavy when the lockdowns started. I bought a rig for my home for the first time. I said I would throw it away when the lockdowns ended, but then ended up convincing myself it helped my productivity. Once I got out of the lockdowns, I’d smoke the same dabs but the prior feeling of productivity wasn’t there. I’d keep trying and trying but every time I smoked a dab, I’d be tired and heavy - kind of the point of them. In reality, the dabs never made me productive, but when I moved home I was excited about a new way of working and just automatically associated the two. 

I quit weed only about a week ago, and already feel a major difference. I’m in a great mood all the time, my sleep has heavily improved (less groggy waking up), I am having crazy vivid and interesting dreams, and my productivity and critical thinking has shot up. The only way I was able to convince myself to stop was just by simply stating that I will never again smoke weed. I’m sure one day I will smoke weed now and then again, but once I can dissociate myself as a stoner, then I can smoke weed casually. Perhaps in 6 months or so I will. The benefit too is my tolerance will reset, meaning that it’s gonna be a hell of a lot cheaper to get stoned. 

Reasons I thought I liked weed:
- Better taste in food. 
- Makes doing stuff more fun
- Felt better
- Easier to sleep
- Chill thing to do with friends

Now how I see it:
- I like food just as much now. Honestly I like it more because I’m less lazy about it. I cook better food for example now.
- It makes doing nothing fun. Getting stoned is a legit activity. Plan your life on a Google Calendar, do you really want to dedicate 4 hours of your e time to getting stoned? Instead I go out and have fun with friends now.
- I feel way better now. Weed actually makes me feel heavy and somewhat tired. And at the end of the day, I look back and think how boring what I actually did stoned was. On top of that, your life skips by so much quicker on weed. I don’t want to skip to the end of my life... It doesn’t matter what you’re doing or if you think the future will be better. You can only live in the current present moment once. I think about that frequently now while in a situation. 
- I sleep way better now. Plus the dreams are crazy fun. I wake up every morning with a new story I lived through lol.
- Eating food and grabbing a beer is way more fun, honestly. That’s why people go out drinking to celebrate, and not sitting on their sofa smoking weed. I used to think smoking weed was more fun until I look back at it and compare to how I feel now.

Other added benefits:
- Way better memory 
- Save money
- Get more done (spend your evenings working on a new hobby or business)
- HONESTLY for me less anxiety. Weed does make you feel relaxed I guess, but I get social anxiety from weed. Stressed out about things I said or did before.
- Increased focus 


I don’t even crave weed now. It goes away within like a weed. Just stick through the first week and keep yourself very busy and it’ll be fine. Google calendar also really changed my life. Plotting everything out really helps you keep busy and ensure your time is well spent.",21

Day 12/13 (starting to lose count to be honest)

I mentioned in previous posts about pretty hefty anxiety and some bouts of depression / feeling very low / lost. Much of that has subsided and I’m starting to feel a lot better!

Still quite a bit of brain fog and finding concentration an issue but also have been experiencing some episodes of headaches anybody else experience this? I’d love to hear about it, even for a little reassurance.

I have been very conscious about hydration and am sure that’s not an issue regarding the headaches, screen time down a lot too.

Dreams have been f’ing mental. I have always had some wild night terrors (and funnily enough just found out my brother does too, must be genetic) but these are something else man LOL. Even waking up and remembering that my dreams had names, last night was ‘Kil’kumachi’ and I was in a medieval castle with a band mate, we were trying to escape from something but also slowly losing the ability to speak - madness but interesting.

But then around day 60 or so, I started drinking a bit more regularly. Like, 3-4 drinks about 3 nights a week. Even though I'm a 6ft tall guy, that's still a lot for me, because I typically don't drink much.

This weekend past, I drank a lot. I've been pretty down about my city entering BACK into quarantine, and I bought a 12 pack of beer on a Saturday. I drank 5 that night. On Sunday, I drank 7 beers, and then walked to the dispensary (yup, it's that close). I bought some edibles and ate them right there. The rest of the night, I was just generally fucked up. I don't really remember the rest of the night but i crashed hard pretty early.

I'm really disappointed in myself. I feel like I shouldn't have to reset my calendar, and be on day 1 again, because I didn't get to actually relapse and remember it. I wasn't even craving it last week - drunk u/okinawe_pancake was the one who wanted it! why should I have to reset my calendar??""

&#x200B;

But three days later, my body is craving more weed, even though I don't even remember my relapse. I can't lie to myself and say ""it didn't count!"" My desire to be in an altered state of mind, under the influence, came from the same place as my weed addiction. 

&#x200B;

The only conclusion I've come to is this:

* I am a marijuana addict.
* I'm not an alcoholic, but when I drink alcohol, I remember how much I enjoy being under the influence. I usually drink moderately, and most of the time when I drink, it doesn't make me want to get stoned. But every now and then, it will make me want to get stoned. And if weed is available, which is always is in my city, i WILL get stoned.
* Even if there's only a 5% chance that taking a drink will lead to me relapsing, that chance is far too high. Eventually, it will happen.
* The only way for me to be marijuana-free is to live an entirely sober life.",12

Sobriety has been pretty great for me to be honest(day 10). I have been able to spend more time with people that mean a lot too me and I have felt so much more present in all my activities. I have got a lot done and felt pretty accomplished. It has been pretty good. However I just found out a few hours ago that I have COVID and I have to self quarantine for the next 10 days. I do not have any symptoms. I feel just fine. I have reached out to everyone that I have had any sort of contact with in the last 2 weeks. I have been wearing my mask in public and at work.

The way I see it this is just a challenge for my willpower. I will continue to abstain from weed. There is no reason to weaken my respiratory system further should I experience complications. I am kind of surprised I got it now. I would have thought I would be much more likely to get it weeks ago when I was sharing bowls/joints with folks. Oh wells.

I am mostly bummed because I was going to get a meniscectomy tomorrow for an injury that has been lingering for about 7 months. Now I have to delay that a bit. I am a little bummed because I could have exposed loved ones. I will remain cognizant of how I am feeling and if I experience shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, cough and will be checking my temp periodically. I guess I just wanted to share because I am bummed out. This too shall pass.

I only smoked heavily for a year, really. Anxiety through the roof and diminishing returns from the weed has made me stop, and now I realize how pointless it is to be enslaved to this plant.

Weed keeps me complacent. Weed paralyzes my progress. Weed makes me unable to think about anything other than weed. When you're really addicted to weed, it's like each joint is tuning up your engine so you can make it just a little further down the road, but you go a few miles and you're already needing another tune-up - the problem is that the whole damn car is fucked, and I realize I can't continue living like this beat-up hooptie. I gotta upgrade myself.

But anyways, the first  week is always not so bad for me, and I don't know why. I can laugh, I feel like my witty old self, and I am a ball of energy. I feel like the person I am supposed to be - it's almost like hypomania even though I assure you I'm not bipolar. Then something happens in my brain and I feel the full effects of the THC drought. I am anxious, uncomfortable, and the confidence goes right back out the door.

I guess I just want to know if anybody has ever felt the same so I don't feel alone as I quit this time. It's so frustrating to feel so good sober and see who you can really be, only to have it fall away as you continue recovering. But I'm holding the memory of those good days close. It must be used as motivation, friends. It's gonna be for good, this quit - I am fucking done with it. Fuck that high, I got my own supply of happiness somewhere inside me.

Had to make a new account (was Treehugger148) cuz I got locked out of my email but I made a post a week ago about it being my day one and all my reasons why I was quitting. Made so many amazing connections and this group is making me feel like there’s no way I’ll head back to my old life of smoking up all the time. I was an every day smoker for 6 years, and now I’m 7 days clean!

Just thought I’d share that I was talking to a friend I made when I lived in Australia for a year (I’m American) and without knowing I wasn’t smoking anymore she said “You seem different. I feel like I’m talking to the old Delaney who I used to spend hours on the porch in deep chats with”. And she was so right! I felt the most connected and whole I had ever felt during my time in Australia, and it’s no coincidence that’s when I was smoking the least. It feels so good to be my truest self without the haze. 

Anyway, this is all to say, if you’re reading this: keep it up! The people who truly love you will notice the presence, and appreciate it. Give yourself the time and space to get to know the real you, underneath the high. As scary as it can be, it’s worth it ✨",11
2020-07-16 14:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hserjl/i_never_thought_this_would_be_me/,I never thought this would be me.,"Sorry this is long. I never thought this would be me or something I would struggle with. And nobody knows I'm struggling. I'm on day 2, and I miss it. 

I also feel like my struggle is some what invalid since I've only been smoking regularly for 3 months. I know this isn't true, but it's a hard thought to dismiss. 

I first smoked in highschool. It was never a regular thing. I mostly smoked to fit in. I didn't hate it, but also didn't love it. It just was. Through my adult life I only smoked a few times  June 2019 I smoked an oil pen for the first time while drunk. I've had issues with insomnia since I was 12 and I never had a good sleep while drinking. I slept amazing that night. Amazing. Even after alcohol. I thought about buying my own pen to help during insomnia bouts, but this was before legalization it was too much of a hassle. 

I don't want to seem like I'm looking down on anyone, and especially not regular cannabis users. But I definitely don't meet what society or media has protrayed as a 'stoner'. I'm 30, type A, accomplished female that's always doing something. I have a great career, a big social circle, I volunteer, I run marathons, I'm an avid outdoors woman.  I've never seen signs of an additive personality in me. I don't drink coffee (even through university), I power through headaches, I avoid sleeping medications unless I've been multiple days without sleep because I never wanted to be reliant on something. I have always been acutely aware that I never want to seek refuge in anything unhealthy (drugs, alcohol, food, sex, etc) when life was difficult.  I had my party girl days when I was 19. I've done enough cocaine and have never had an issue saying no to it. 

This April (April 19th to be exact) I was in a bad mood and called my fwb, who is a functional stoner. We smoked together and everything was perfect. I didn't care about anything anymore. I could think about things, but there was no emotion to them. It was great. I loved it. Next day, I bought my own pen.  

At first it was okay. I would live my normal life. I went to work, exercise, made dinner, saw friends, and do all of my tasks for a day before rewarding myself with my pen. Some days it would just be one hit, others I would push the limits of how high could I get. Then I would have a great sleep and repeat the next day. One day would bleed into another. I would smoke socially too and it soon replaced alcohol. 

Then it changed. It wasn't exactly an overnight change, but sometimes it feels that way. I had a nagging feeling that it wasn't a good thing to smoke mostly every day. I kept telling myself it was okay because I was in an good place mentally, and it's covid days and I have the extra time. Once covid was over I would go back to my normal life. This is just me passing the time. It was almost a joke to my friends and myself. That I, out of all people, was a 'stoner'. And then I wasn't in a good place mentally. Someone reached out to me and gave me the biggest curve ball of my life so far, and I still believe it will be always the biggest shock of my life. I started smoking more to sleep, but I quickly started smoking because I didn't want to feel anything. Soon after this I overhead a conversation that I would be laid off by fall. I smoked more. And more. It was no longer at the end of my day, but the end of my work day. Then I would smoke in the morning or afternoon and lose the day. I found out I wasn't going to be laid off, but I still wanted to smoke. And so I did. 

One morning I woke up upset in the early morning,  around 4:30am. I hadn't smoked the night before. It was dawn and I only wanted to smoke. The idea of getting through my day sober was hell to me. This scared me. I didn't want to feel like this. I didn't want to need something. I called a friend at 6:30am and we talked things through. I realized I was no longer taking care of myself, and I was paying the price. I decided it was time to be sober. This was June 21.  

First few days were okay. I thought I was exaggerating my stuggle. That it wasn't really a problem, I am upset from external issues, pot isn't addictive, and even if it was I don't have an additive personality. I was finding it difficult to sleep. I started thinking how is it any different for me to take any sleeping meds instead of smoking. My best friend is a physician and I asked him. Unaware that I was/am struggling, he said it really isn't different. He knows how bad my insomnia is and that how I was using pot for insomnia wasn't bad (again, he doesn't know the whole of it). So I started the cycle over again. First it was just at the end of my day. Then early evening. Then minor bad news hits and I'm back to smoking in the morning/afternoon. This time it isn't a joke though. This time no one else knows. I publically said I was sober for the time being, I couldn't bring myself to admit I had failed. I withdrew myself more because no one could know my secret. I found I would decline plans since I wasn't fully sober and I couldn't let anyone see me high. I decided that I would finish my current cartridge and be done. 

I made it a few days. Then I broke down and bought not one, but two cartridges telling myself it was only to sleep. I got baked that afternoon. 

The last two weeks have been bad. For months I have been neglecting everything to get high. I wasn't getting anything done. My apartment was a disaster, I hadn't regularly exercised, I hadn't done anything. I hated this. Even high I hated this. The first emotion I really felt high was regret.  I told myself tomorrow would be different. It wasn't. Each day on my way home from work I would make a mental plan for the evening about what I was going to do. And 5 minutes after being home I was baked and in my bed. 

I got rid of my pen yesterday. I knew the only was I could stop myself was not making it accessible. This is day 2 sober. I know if I hadn't gotten rid of my pen last night I wouldn't have made it. Even right now I want to be high.

I'm stuck living with my parents cuz of quarantine and was just forced to go on a toxic family trip that made me extremely angry and depressed. So of course I was high throughout the whole trip and would purposely get really high before family gatherings so I could be as disconnected as possible. I knew I was using as an escape, there was not a moment on that entire trip where I wasn't high. Right when I wake up, literally RIGHT when I open my eyes in the morning I reach for my pen. I just went through a gram in a week. I know thats not a lot for some people but it is for me. And I'm just constantly thinking about weed. I'm going to try to leave my pen at someone else's place for a week but I'm really scared. I drilled it into myself that yesterday was the last day I was gonna smoke and I was SO set on it AND I STILL SOMEHOW CONVINCED MYSELF TO SMOKE just now. I feel so stuck and I'm literally a coward cuz I don't want to tell anyone about my problem because I hate the feeling of existing and I'm scared of reaching out to anyone about any problems. so i guess im fucked

edit: i really dont know what im trying to get from this post. i just feel like theres no way out. i feel stupid for making this but every time i dont smoke I get terrible nightmares and they're even more vivid and I remember them WAY more than when I was sober. and my anxiety/anger/depression comes back in hella strong ",3

Yesterday, I was catching up with a friend who I haven't spoken to in a couple months and mentioned that I stopped. Looked at my phone's calendar to tell him how long it has been and that's when I noticed that yesterday would have been the day.

In this past month, I've made two fully original music tracks, I've kept up with my at home workout routine, and I've gone on multiple walks a day (averaging 14k steps according to my FitBit).

The good news is I have to calculate it because I'm not focused on how many days it has been.  For years I wondered what I could of accomplished sans the bud, cigs, and wine.  The bud was the last to go.  I'm living my hat trick now.

One thing that has definitely improved is increased energy, which helps so much by having good sleep.  I went from absolutely restless shit sleep before dumping the wine to solid sleep.  I figure it will take a little bit more time for my brain  to fully adjust to no THC.  Good REM is key.  Sleep is for healing the body and keeping the parasympathetic nervous system in check , working for me instead of against me.  Sleep glorious sleep.  I'm waking up tired so I think massive repair work is being done.

I've started to exercise again and that is a huge win.  Svelte toned body is in my future.

Next on the agenda is doing several projects that take focus to do.  Not that they are so hard, but   they are yucky.  New skills need to be learned, which is not easy if I smoked pot before hand cause I was avoiding doing it.

I am actually getting eager to knock off these other things that REALLY need to be handled that I have avoided for years.  It was a disadvantage to not handle these things.  I can't wait to be free of any mind drags of things that I ""Should"" be doing.  That means I'll be free to fly and to enjoy fully my recreational time with no nagging in the back of my mind about the crap I need to get done.

One guy was happy cause he reached a certain milestone, and somebody answered: stop counting and start living. 

For me personally, this has been the best advice EVER. When I first tried to stop, I gave myself milestones like a month or two months, but this justified ""trying again, cause maybe I learned to control it now"". As many of you know, that is a lie.

Anyway, with milestones, I feel like I'm forcing myself to think about the substance, and unintentionally keeping it a part of my life. But I want to GET RID OF IT. And to stop counting and start living has been the single best thing to keep in mind for me. When I ask myself now: how long has it been? I push that away and answer to myself: it doesn't matter, I'm living now.

Now this tip may not be for you, maybe setting goals with dates is simply the best approach for you. But if that has never worked, try this approach: stop counting and start living. Obviously, I know when I stopped -16 days ago, a bigger stop than I've had in years - and it's good to 'know'. But to think about it everyday has usually set me up for failure. 

I'm sorry if this mental approach doesn't help you, but it sure is helping me MOVING ON from weed.",359

It went from casual social smoking with flatmates to habitually rolling up every time I felt anxious or upset. I didn't think much of it because I was still able to ""function"" and get reasonable grades at first, but everything started slipping and I could never figure out why. I've always been somewhat subconsciously aware that I had a problem because I was now smoking every day and it was fucking up my life but I didn't care to do anything about it.

I've now been diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety, barely been coping with my job and just generally deteriorated so much but I mask that all with our good old friend Mary Jane and created a toxic never-ending cycle. I've tried to quit and every time think ""what's the point?"", ""I don't wanna feel like shit/deal with these emotions"" or ""its just a plant"" and easily fall back into it, especially because my friends all smoke too. It's especially harder when there are certain people who you smoke with every time you see and form that habituation.

But here I am, at the end of my tether, haven't left my room in days, haven't seen any of my friends and I've just ran out of weed.

First month weed-free and yet it feels like I just quit last week. I thought I'd feel some sense of achievement but since week two I've been counting the days since I last lit one up while dreading the day I'll slip up and have to change the sum of 1s to a 0 again.

On a lighter note, here's some things I noticed in this time:

* Real life is hard and weed is an easy escape. Whenever something became too stressful in the past I took a break by smoking weed, postponing important work by hours or even days because I was too stoned to focus.
* Weed makes you blissfully unaware of your current situation and its consequences. I'm now paying for previously-mentioned setbacks because things I should've done ages ago are keeping me from reaching goals I wanted to reach by now. Stoned me thought ''One day..'', sober me thinks ''If not now, when??''
* Weed can make you selfish. I used to be and still am a bit self-absorbed, but I'm starting to realise people have their own unique viewpoints on the world and it's wrong to assume that if I think a certain way, others will understand and agree with my perception.
* Admitting you've quit weed can be hard if you have stoner friends, but it can be liberating too. I was afraid I'd be the ''lame friend'' and they'd turn their backs on me... But instead I got congratulations on my strength and some have even told me I've inspired them to quit as well.
* If you need help, go and get yourself help. Quitting an addiction is hard. If sobriety is negatively affecting your everyday life go find an easier (and healthy!) way to deal with it. I noticed a lot of recent quitters on this sub are having sleeping and eating problems. Please don't ignore these withdrawal symptoms as they can ruin your life pretty fast. Not eating in such a stressful time can screw up your head and insomnia that lasts 3 or more days can lead to hallucinations or even psychosis. Listen to what your body is telling you and don't let the side-effects of quitting get in the way of your success.

That is all. Good luck to those starting out, I swear it's worth it - just stay strong & stay smart.",44

I’ve have been Jogging every 2nd day for 4 month now. Remember to stretch out!

Been eating a lot healthier, fiber-rich, Cut down hard on sugars, and reduced fat intake too.

I replaced coffee with green tea, green tea has proven calming efftects on our brain and body.

I’ve tryied kick starting my brain by doing crosswords, Playing both new n old difficult games, where focus is needed, this has really callenged me and made me feel tirred! now i Can focus pretty good and for hours again, that’s huge for me.

I think our brain is like a muscle!
For years we’ve been feeding it with thc, unhealthy foods n drinks.
When we finally stop doing that, we gotta be patient, and change what we can, when we Can!
It dosn’t happen over night, keep doing it and results will slowly appear, just like progress in the gym, or with jogging or what exercise you chose.

Hang in everyone, keep treating yourselves with the respect you’ve earned by finally quitting for good. 

Change one habbit, slowly build on that.

Change one life, for the better!

You Can do it!

It has been a trying week. I saved someone's life this week by talking them down during a suicide attempt and helping with a medical emergency prior to EMS arriving. Unfortunately, I was potentially exposed to COVID. I have a sore throat and fatigue and I'm concerned but not at the point of needing to be tested. I am not sure that quitting medical marijuana was helpful in any way except I am getting it out of my system in case of a drug test at work. My head feels totally clear but my depression and PTSD feel uncontrolled. I'm helping clients in person for now but our state just mandated telework so I may be stuck at home alone barely speaking to clients (I understand and will endure whatever it takes to protect those who are high risk). 

I'm afraid of where my mind will go if I'm isolated again and without medical marijuana. I have a history of trauma that I largely cope with by helping others. It used to be so debilitating that I could not work but I worked very hard toward recovery. However, during the first quarantine period, memories resurfaced and I became suicidal at times. Medical marijuana suppressed those urges while I used appropriate coping tools. Now I don't have that. At this point, the only reason I want to quit is the risk of losing my job. Maybe I'm not right for this sub but has anyone else quit and then found that it had been working to control symptoms? I have an endless supply of mental health resources and understand how to use coping skills effectively, but I think medical marijuana had been keeping me well. I do not say this to encourage anyone to continue using/start again because our bodies are all different so please stay the course if you need to quit.

I am 24 and I have a custody and divorce battle and i been smoking to ease my stress. I smoke on average 9 grams a week for little over a year. Ive quit smoking marijuana at 17 due to rehab for 11 months before that i started at 15. I went back into smoking at 22 when my wife left me and quit at 23. I started back up like last August with dab pens and dabs never really smoke flower much.  I quit for 3 months then during the covid19 i started smoking again.

I want to stop now and save alot of money and move on for marijuana for good",1

Maybe I’m looking for advice, but I don’t know if I want to quit. Not because I’ll miss it or anything but because the thought really scares me. It scares me because I think I’m too far gone and that PAWS won’t ever go away.

I’ve been taking dabs daily for the last 5 years now. Smoking weed daily for 7. At the moment, I’m about 2 days sober (not even by choice). But damn do I feel like shit. And I know it’s supposed to feel this way, but I also feel like I’m not really taking care of my body because of it. No appetite, terrible bowel movements, and an overall feeling of malaise and anxiety. 

At this point, the only reason I want to smoke now is to feel healthy. But that seems like the opposite of what it should be. Maybe I will continue this since I’m already almost at day 3, but part of me really wants to grab some tomorrow after work. Also I am in the process of moving which is like THE WORST time for me to be feeling like complete asshole. If I do continue, I will make another post.

I had a horrible few years as a teenager. But at 17 Id started working out, learning Spanish, hooking up with girls, had so many dreams and hopes etc. 

Then, I found weed. And that, bit by bit, became my life. To the point all I cared about was getting that next hit. Coming across weed was the biggest curse of my life, aside from quitting football in my early teens. It slowly stripped my personality, my dreams, my motivation... I became a shell of the person I was supposed to be. At 24 now, and 24 days clean.. I’m truly realising what this drug has done to me. Or rather, what I unconsciously let it do to me. 

At first, I used it because it just felt amazing, plain and simple. It made me more social, creative, innovative, have insights into things I’d never even entertained before. I truly thought the heavens had finally, after all these years, blessed me with some sort of magic formula. It was kinda like - “ahhhh... so this is what life’s all about”. But slowly, it caused me to self isolate, and repress emotions. I had great trouble fitting in with the world, could never hold a job down for various reasons.. and weed just became all I cared about. But it led to utter depression and intense suicidal cravings. 

And now, here I am, with a body and mind that’s sustained damage for various reasons directly and indirectly related to weed, and with a hell of a lot of stunted growth in all areas. 

I’m starting life again. I’m working out nowadays.  I have such an incredible amount of anger and rage at what’s happened. I’ll be honest I got into the habit of hitting myself many times with a metal spatula... because it helps the emotional pain and it’s like a punishment for fucking this one and only life up so much.

I hope anyone new to smoking weed and realised they’ve got a problem... nip it in the bud ASAP before it takes over your brain more and more like a cancer. Like it goes from being stage 1 cancer in the beginning stages, to stage 4 if you do it enough and for the wrong reasons. It’s still definitely possible to quit  at stage 4 and many have... but there will be damage and it will be a lot harder to survive than stopping early on. Good luck .",13

Like we're talking laying in bed all day, sleep schedule completely amok, no sense to do most things I used to find enjoyable.

I think the most prominent feeling is utter loneliness and a bit of worthlessness.

Have you guys felt this way at this point?

It's just that nobody I care about really reaches out.
I'm always the one starting any conversation, and it just takes so much effort even if I know it'd be good for me.
Usually, when I think of someone, I'll just reach out.
Is it normal for people not to do that?
Like why doesn't anyone want to talk to me or reach out?

I have smoked weed since I was 13, march break of grade 7 i believe... I told my self i would never buy it and that lasted till i was about 16 years old. Moral of the story never say never.. Everyone I have ever hung out with since 13 years old has practically been a smoker so i just enjoyed it and went along.

 I quit for 3 months when i was 17 as I wanted to join the military.. Did not pass my aptitude test with high enough of a grade to become a Mechanic.. So sure enough i started smokeing again for another solid year only to quit for a great job! I loved it , quiting that was! Lol so any how I got a different job offer and left the job were you were drug tested. Started to smoke again and its been 3 years steady tokeing just about every night, not alot but a few bongs just to chill and watch netflix.. 

I built myself a home at 18 years old and alot of the time i was sober. When i did get high and worked on my house i messed shit up! Cut 2 measure once... Sorta stuff. Id get high with my friends and couldent speak I have weak social skills. I cant hold a conversation high, yet alone sober. I was a burnout high but still keep on hitting the bong. Motivation was non existent while high I was a lonely couch potato. Been single for pretty well my hole life im 20 years old now. 

I have always wanted to quit but never had a reason to. Nor did i have a reason to get high it was just a habbit i suppose. 

The other weak I had a party at a friends house was a great time drunk and laughing just having a blast! My buddy pulled out a joint and i took a few hits only to fall into a chair and sit there quietly untill the buzz went away. 

That made my realize I had to change for the better. Iv had alot of positives in my life but it was never from weed it was good times sober or with a few drinks. 

Its been 3 days so far (laugh now cry later).. Iv been a little more irritable but 1 day after I had a awesome dream! Mornings already feel better and im more focused at work. Im a mechanic so i gotta pay attention to detail and remember stuff.. Weed threw my memory out the window. 

I keep telling myself do I quit for life or smoke 1 a year on my birthday... I kinda want to quit for life. Im just tired of chasing a high that brought me down.

I want to try and keep in connect with this post and follow up each week. So if your thinking about quiting do it with me! Together we will strive for success and I ensure you your life will be better!

My long term gf (nearly 1,5 years, I'm 21 this was my longest relationship) broke up with me two and a half months ago, it's been a rough time adjusting and my best friend told me breakups are comparable to quitting cocaine, I think this might be right even though I was never addicted to cocaine, and what I've felt these past months has given me the opportunity to be myself again, after trying to be someone's favorite version of myself. I tried to live again, I tried weed again, I numbed myself out of the feeling that I just lost the person that I thought I'd spent my life together. 

But after smoking again a couple times I realized, even though she was supporting me and telling me to get off weed, it was my own power that pulled me from that shit and now I feel happier than ever before. Because I know that i'm strong and mature enough to pull through, I don't need somebody to tell me weed isn't supporting me. It was me all along, she was supporting it, but I quit it. I wanna learn to self discipline myself. I want to proceed with living a weed free live, because it robs me of all the precious memories and all of me being my beautiful self, with all my mistakes, it robs me from being me. I get calm, I get quiet and all those things don't fit for me or the way I want to experience life. I'm proud to say I may didn't quit drugs, but I'm not in a toxic relationship anymore. And the drugs are the next thing I'm gonna leave in the past.

Not much at one time usually, but a couple hits every hour or 2 from when I woke up to went to sleep.  A little more than a quarter a week.  I’m a touring musician and work in studios while off the road so it’s always been “part of the lifestyle”.  “Helps to get creative.”  This time off, due to the virus, came out of no where because crowds are no longer allowed to gather so I’ve had a lot of time to sit and think about my past decisions.  One day I woke up and decided no more weed.  It was the last one of my “vices”.  I had seen it slowly start making me a nervous wreck.  I have slowly tapered off everything for the most part except weed.  I thought I could always keep weed as my guilty pleasure.  And it did, I guess, help me get off the others.  It’s medicine after all right?

Wrong!  This past week it has proven to be the hardest habit to stop.  For me, nothing compares to the debilitating disassociation that comes with quitting weed.  And the anger.  Man do I feel angry and hopeless. I am on an ok diet and great exercise regimen.  Running everyday for the past couple years and home dumb bell workouts.  And yes it helps tremendously, but only while actually doing it.  But not smoking has left me with so much time to sit and actually process things and it’s only been a week!  It led to my first major panic attack in a long time 2 days ago and I’m still not out of the fog from it.  I thought I was dying, arms numb, couldn’t process anything, sick to my stomach, the whole 9, for a solid 2 hours and it still feels lingering.  Like I wasted so much time, hurt so many important people to me.  And it’s finally clear that it was my fault.  Weed just made everything “better.”  

It feels like all of my focus is gone.  There’s no happy thoughts anymore just all the negative swimming in my head.  Did I mention the anger?  I expected it for a few days but it’s gotten to the point where I thought it would have passed.   

Has anyone else dealt with the dissociation aspect?  

It’s hell.  And there’s no way I can go back and lose this progress because I can’t put myself through this again.  It feels like I can lose my grip on reality for a split second and I have to talk myself back or something?  Idk, any advice or similar stories would be appreciated.",6

I was also putting a good amount of money into that habit. So it seems it was pointless. I have experienced mood swings and times when I get frustrated to the point of tears - but I know this is a part of the process. My mind is rewiring and my body is healing. The main reason for wanting to quit this because of the nasty cough I had developed. This during covid-19 made me feel even more stigmatized than just being a pothead in the first place. The last thing people want to hear coming out of my mouth is a hacking cough. I'm still experiencing this cough but as the days go on I feel more and more relief from it. Yesterday (day 6) I coughed up some dark colored gunk which was disgusting but also it's nice to know my lungs are expelling the shit I willingly inhaled to make myself ""feel better"".  I am nowhere near 100% quit but this improvement in my health is what will keep me from going back to smoking. 

I quit smoking cigarettes in Aug of 2018. It was the vice I least enjoyed and it made me hate myself the most. I had a hard time with that but with the help of Allen Carr's book ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" I managed to quit. 

I quit drinking in November 2019 after an exceptionally bad night of barfing. I had been out having a grand ol' time on the town- drinks flowing and decided to end the night with a joint. I started spinning, hyperventilating, groaning and moaning and of course releasing everything all night long. My heart rate was through the roof and I thought that I could die. I ruined what was very fun night out. I was so mad at myself. While I did ruin my night it was still a memorable one- the end of an era with alcohol. I read Allen Carr's book about alcohol (How to Control Alcohol) because his book about smoking helped me so much. This book helped me as well- I have been alcohol free since that night in November.

I held on to marijuana after I quit those things because ""it was all I had left"". In some ways I thank pot for being there for me because without that illusory crutch I may have still smoked cigs and drank alcohol. But I knew it was still no good for me and one day it would also have to end. I discovered r/leaves from doing some internet research. While I found it really inspiring I still continued to smoke. I hoped one day I could come on here and write about how I too had stopped. I wanted to read a book about it because that has helped me before and the one I found was Matthew Clarke's ""Quitting Weed: The Complete Guide"". It has helped me to stay motivated. It was nice to see at the back of that book some excerpts from r/leaves. Pretty cool- I would recommend.

Well Im one week in to be completely sober. I love it. The pride I feel is the most rewarding as well as the improvement in this smoker's cough. I cant wait til it is completely gone. I look forward to come back on here a month and a year from now to write another post about progress.

I’ve heard about this method people used for quitting smoking cigarettes, and I decided I’m going to try it. I’ve always used weed as my vice to cope with every single inconvenience in life, big or small. 

Whenever I have that urge of omg I just need to get high right now to not care anymore, I will journal/write down the reason I wanted to get high. Then, I’ll examine these areas of my life and learn to cope without the weedz :) 

Let me know if anyone has done this and how it worked for them",5

I think once you’re at a point you know personally you need a change you start to want the feeling of a clear head. It’s cool. Doesn’t dismiss that weed is a pleasant feeling but it goes away. Idk just thought I would share hope everyone is doing ok and don’t beat yourself up if you have a setback! That’s one change I’ve made. Don’t make this an all or nothing thing. Keep trying!",8

At approx 5:30 pm EST, here in the great state of New Jersey; I will be 1 month, or 30 days, or 720 hours, or 43,200 minutes or 2,592,000 seconds sober from the tree.  It sounds a lot cooler to me when I get down to the smaller units of time because it seems longer and inspiring. 

I'm proud though.  I'm starting to sleep better finally, and i'm dreaming for the first time in years.  Well, i'm sure I was dreaming, I just couldn't recall any of it.  I started to keep a journal of my dreams that I scribble in when I wake up, and that turned into a journal that I keep at night as well to reflect on the day.  A tool to use to look back on in weeks to see how i'm doing overall.  I'm also remembering shit a lot easier, not walking into rooms and having to jog my memory to try and remember what the hell my intentions were.  I also have found that i'm just a little bit more organised and because of that the little things aren't piling up and stressing me the fuck out. and i'm starting to rebuild my relationship with my family.  I can sit down with my mom and talk to her, remember what we talked about, and if she asks me to do something, I don't need to apologize as often because I forgot to do what she asked, I just do it.  I still forget sometimes, but that's human nature, right?

I sat down and started to actually create music above and beyond just 8 bar loops that would lead nowhere.  Somethings clicking inside now, and i'm learning to use this software a lot quicker, and i'm learning new tricks as I go.  Someday I might be able to show off what I make, but for now thats going to all be staying on the hard drive.  I really think being stoned was holding me back on that.

I wish I could go to the gym though, I workout a little at home and go on walks to pass the time, jamming out to music.  I just dont want to touch shit that potentially sick people are also touching in a confined space, while also wearing a mask and working out with asthma.  That shit sucks.

Anyway, it's up to me to make this happen, and I hate losing.

I'll update you guys in another month, if you want.

Be well.

2020-07-15 04:12:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hrjom2/day_4/,Day 4,"Hey guys, recently stumbled upon this community looking for guidance into how to start my new sober life and I figured I’d share my story : )

I started smoking recreationally junior year of high school, about 4 years ago. In the beginning I really didn’t smoke too often but I enjoyed myself when I did. A few days after graduation I almost got arrested while smoking with a few of my buddies which scared me straight for about 6 months.

I don’t really remember when I started smoking again but it was sometime during my second semester of college. However, it was different. I had experienced paranoia before but when I started smoking again, it seemed like I was consistently anxious. For whatever reason I kept smoking anyways. 

 I never really considered the weed a problem up until last year. I was very stressed last year. School was kicking my ass with relationship problems and general anxiety also in the mix. I ended up smoking away the entire year. I was neglectful if my responsibilities. Because of this, my grades dropped and my relationship fell apart. As soon as I decided I was done with the day I would smoke. I didn’t enjoy being out while high because I was so paranoid. I found myself just sitting around watching YouTube videos and listening to music. I essentially turned myself into something of a recluse. When people would ask about my life I genuinely didn’t know what to say. I didn’t have any hobbies or passions. I just went to work and smoked.

Around November of last year I started doing some introspection. I was on the verge of dropping out and my depression was at its lowest point. I decided I was going to stop smoking for the sake of my mental health. I made it about a month and half. Somewhere in there I convinced myself that things had gotten better and that if I started smoking again I’d be able to manage it better...I was wrong

COVID hit and I was stuck at home. My roommate smokes frequently so there was always tree available. I found myself right back where I was before. Smoking everyday be procrastinating schoolwork.I ended up smoking away a few more months and falling further behind in school.

This May I was diagnosed with ADHD. For the first time in a long time things made sense to me. This diagnosis gave me what I felt I’d been lacking for a long time. Some clarity. I understood why I struggled with certain aspects of life that seemed to come naturally to everyone else. I realized that I wasn’t the problem. 

I started taking medication for the ADHD and my productivity skyrocketed. I truly started to feel better about myself and as a consequence cut down my smoking. I didn’t stop but I only smoked a few days a week as opposed to everyday.

However, when I smoked this Saturday I got a call from a friend. The entire call I was anxious and quiet. I didn’t feel like myself and it was very apparent that there was something off about me. I hate that feeling and I’ve been dealing with it for too long. I don’t ever want to feel like that again. I hate feeling socially inept. I hate feeling groggy. I hate being stuck in my head every time I smoke wondering why I even smoked in the first place. 4 days sober and many more to come. 

Stay strong Friends.",4

I decided to stop smoking for various reasons after a 11 years addiction, with periods of abstinence (2,5 years at most). 
For the last 3 years I have started smoking again until it hit a daily spot and now I feel trapped, low energy, my blood pressure is too low and my short term memory is playing too much tricks for a person who works with cognitive disabled people. 
This is the day 1 and I want to document my feelings towards this addiction. For now I feel lots of anxiety but it’s manageable. I am wondering what did I do all this time except being in another dimension to get away from my emotions ? Weed helped me immensely to sort of a lot of repressed traumas and to give me great insights when I needed one. But now it feels like I don’t need that anymore. 
I’m only afraid I will be empty as fuck if I don’t smoke but I work on that in therapy.
Wish me luck

It started out as a fun and beneficial thing to do but after a few months I developed substance abuse and started destroying my life.  Smoking everyday has ruined my life and my health in many ways.  I'm allergic to it too so I always get congestion and inflammation.  Some strains make me depressed and anxious and others make the depression go away.  I've struggled to not smoke strains that I don't react well with if it's all I have.
I know I need to stop smoking for my health to improve but I'm struggling.  I still smoke everyday.  I've been very lonely because of how uncomfortable being around people is when I'm fucked up mentally.  I had a really good relationship with this girl for almost a year but we broke up a couple weeks ago because I fucked up my mental health.  I got off my anti-depressants about a month ago and have been smoking strains that I haven't been reacting well with still.  We would still be together right now if I didn't fuck myself up.

It was very difficult for me to quit smoking. After all, it was my favorite vice. Furthermore, as a 12 year habit it was really hard to remember what life was like without the weed. I'm proud to say I finally did it and I couldn't be happier I made the decision. For those on day 1 or those looking for a push, here are 3 things I gained after 30 days clear minded. 

1) Better sleep. We all know this is true but wow! Some days I am even waking up without an alarm. I find myself less likely to drag on at night mindlessly gaming or browsing the web. This has been a huge reward that pays off more each day. 

2) Better relationships. I discovered that weed wasn't always best for my mood. I find it to be a stereotype that weed always makes you happy. In fact, I often found myself more cranky as my high wore off or I haven't smoked yet. With a more consistent mood I've been able to invest more positivity into my relationships. My wife has even taken note of how much more connected we've become!

3) Better Focus. I generally feel more relaxed. It's as if that state of rest I received instantly from the weed is even deeper without it. I remember things and can concentrate longer with more efficiency. 

TL;DR One month in and I have experienced better sleep, relationships, and focus! If you are thinking of quitting or just getting started there are plenty of positives to look forward to!",23

Quit smoking over a month ago. I dont even remember the fucking date, so streesed out. Ive been smoking around 2-3g a day in a country where its strictly illegal. Imagine the hussle...
It doesnt get better.
I dont mean the craving.
I mean everything
Yes days are now 48h long for me instead of 7h.
But everyone seems to have something where they can relax. Tv. Cigs. Tea. Pc. Books. W/e 
I dont. 
Since I work more (not better) I have more ""situations"" that I need to take care of. More stress. 
I dont watch tv. Games are boring now (just bought Death Stranding...starring at the menu for 1h now...stress = zero immersion =wasted time) this applies to everything.
I traveled and visited friends. They bored me. Our club evening bored me. Same applies for other activities.
Where is the spark?
Why is my only thought right now that I will never be normal again.  while other people enjoy  ( at least something) I have to endure these shit thoughts.
Yes I managed to do stuff I would never have done before ( took appointments etc)
Still at the end of the day... we all just want to go at least partially happy to bed. I dont have this feeling. Waking up destroyed. (Doing sports tho)

The point of my post is not the time I've been sober; its about what it took me to get sober and why I have a higher chance of success this time around.

What I have learned is this: I'm a substance addict, different substance from alcohol or opiates and other drugs recognized as highly addictive but internally, mentally, the process is the same. Would I recommend that a heroin user experiment with heroin after they've been off for a month, year, 10 years? No one in their right mind would say that was a good idea. For weed it is looked at differently, but it shouldn't be. The process is exactly the same. The hardest part of quitting isn't going through the physical withdrawals, its staying off the drug once you have stopped.

I have two beliefs on this topic drawn from my own failed experiences over and over again through-out my stoner history. First belief is that if you relapse (use again, any amount) you need to learn from that and shouldn't let it put you in a dire mental state. Second belief is that if you do relapse (use again, any amount) you are highly likely to go back to full time use. Very few people in my experience are exempt from this. Even if you had a bad experience and didn't like the effects you've burst your weed boundary bubble and that is the reason that I continued on smoking for 25 years. Each time I stopped for a while I'd feel better and ""miss"" weed. I'd re-introduce it into my life in some way, maybe it was because I was depressed and was at my wits-end, or I was drunk and had some, the reason does not matter. In all of those cases eventually I'd go back to my daily using again. Every. Single. Time. With no exceptions, otherwise I wouldn't find myself here right now. The difference for me this time around is that I've come to that realization. I know very well that if I have a hit, no matter how unlikely I think it is that I'll end up at my old usage, I ultimately will.

The summary is that if you ""slip"" you are setting yourself up to go back to full blown use again and it has not to do with the physical impacts of what you did but the gradual erosion of the psychological boundary that you placed between you and weed. Using it again will in all likelyhood set you back to your old ways and it may be years before you muster up the courage to try to quit again.",21

However by biggest fear is that I won’t be able to cope without it. Weed IS my outlet. Some days I’m so worked up with anxiety and stress that the only thing I can think about is pulling a dab or ripping a bowl. The stressful, anxious moments get waaay worse when I slow down smoking. But I think if I stopped completely it would get better. I just fear who I am without weed bc I feel like I’m unstable, but I’m also unstable with weed. Feels like I’m trapped sometimes.

Someone once commented that marijuana makes you ""out of service."" I couldn't agree with this more. The moment I smoked, text messages were unanswered, phone calls ignored, proper hygiene/cleanliness forgotten about. I would spend hours in front of the TV watching the same YouTube videos stoned and uninterested. I was basically half-dead for 8 years.

After a little over a week of sobriety, I asked a new co-worker if she would be interested in going on a hike sometime, COVID permitting. It wasn't until she happily accepted that I realized the gravity of what I just did. Did I really just...make plans with someone? And so easily? Without pot-induced anxiety and nervousness? 

Once you eliminate pot from your life, these things really do come back to you easily.

Anyway, I am still dreaming vividly every night and they wake me up. They're not always nightmares, but when they are, holy shit, lol. Aside from an inability to really concentrate at work, this is my main remaining issue with quitting. My appetite has returned to normal, I'm not stupid irritable anymore, I still have cravings, but they're manageable. 

I smoked a TON, all day, everyday, for years, so I understand that healing will take some time, but after not dreaming for so long, or at least not remembering them, this is becoming a thing, lol. How typical is this? 

Also, I've begun to notice something else. I know I said above that the cravings are manageable, and they are, but it seems like the further along I go, the newness of being cannabis free is wearing off, if that makes sense. It is almost like the idea of smoking again is slowly becoming more appealing the longer I go without. Weird, as if the more sober I get, the harder it might start getting, if that makes sense.

quarantine was like hell for me for various reasons but at one point i came up with a case of strep throat for which i needed antibiotics. because of this illness i had to quit smoking (both weed and tobacco) and i also stopped drinking, all with the intention of getting healthy fast. after the two weeks on antibiotics i still had some pus in my throat but the doctor told me not to worry. the longer this went on the longer i was without smoking. obviously smoking weed was my escape from the hell i was living at home, where i shared a flat with some people. i used to smoke every night as a way to ease off all the stress but now with the illness it had been almost one month since i last smoked (also stayed off tobacco and alcohol). this is when i had a panic attack, the first time this ever happened to me in my life, and i got scared shitlessss. granted there are a lot of factors that went into the panic attack but the main two were quarantine and sobriety. the day after i bought tickets to fly back home with my family and everything has been going slowly but steadily better since. it has been a month since im here with my family in a more relaxed atmosphere but i still suffer from some anxiety although i can control it better now, and sometimes i suffer from depersonalisation a little bit (where i’ll start to question who i am or i’ll look at my feet and think ‘this is me, this is what people see’). i also struggle with some insecurities, but i think thats anxiety doing its work because the first week after the panic attack  those insecurities were winning the battle but slowly one by one im starting to fight them off.  it has now been 54 days since i last smoked and i feel waves of brain fog and anxiety throughout the day, sometimes less sometimes more, although steadily declining as i said, which gives me hope. i also have trouble concentrating at times and the things i used to enjoy don't feel as good anymore. i guess the thing im having most trouble with is adjusting to life sober since my perspective on life has been shifted and i now need to adjust accordingly, which will take a lot of work for sure. 

i am 25 now and i have been smoking regularly (almost daily) since i was 17. my biggest fear and doubt is if my brain function will ever go back to ‘full capacity’ or will i stay feeling a little off (like ive been feeling lately) since i read everywhere that the brain stops developing at 25 and i havent given it a good chance to fully develop over the last eight years. 

i would also like to add that throughout these past eight years i had taken brakes of up to six weeks with almost no negative effects (always dreamed more and had more energy) but i feel like now that i was forced to quit, and under the circumstances which it happened (quarantine), it has taken a toll on me. also this time i feel like im quitting for real instead of just taking a break, which psychology is very different.",5

2020-07-14 09:45:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hr1snt/dont_know_how_to_start_quitting/,Don't know how to start quitting,"Looking for advice on how to start quitting... My first reddit post ever, this seems like such a supportive community so I thought I'd give it a shot :) 

Over the past few months I have been strongly considering quitting weed, and I genuinely don't know how to start. I am a regularly smoker, and have been since age 15 (I'm 25 now). I have always thought I had a good handle on it, I even thought I needed it in order to be successful. It never used to stop me from doing things, and I kind of planned my activities around smoking because I felt like it made things more fun.

This year, my life changed quite a bit. I bought a house, started my dream career and moved back to my home Province after 7 years away so I could be closer to the people and the places that I love. I'm basically in the place in life where I thought everything would magically come together and I'd be happy and healthy, but something is off.  I'm finding that weed has the opposite effect on me than it previously did, it feels like I'm in auto-pilot most days and I'm having a hard time truly enjoying things.

So yeah... I know I need to quit, but there are a few things I feel like are really holding me back/causing me to bargain and make excuses why I shouldn't:

1. My boyfriend- He and I started dating because of weed about 5 1/2 years ago, and he has no intention of quitting, ever. I know that he wouldn't have a problem with me quitting, but the fact that it's in our house and so available at all times, is making it harder.  I also really don't want to ask him to change the way he smokes (i.e. bong in our living room), so that fact that it's just sitting there when I get home from work makes it very hard to ignore. I'm afraid that if I stop  it will change our relationship, he's literally the *one*, and I'm scared of jeopardizing that. 
2. My appetite- So far, every time I tried to quit, or take a few days off I feel like I need to start smoking again because I have a hard time eating without it. I literally could have two bites and feel nauseous.  I have taken 2-week long breaks from smoking in the past (because of working away in camps) and I know I can get past that feeling, but it took me at least 4-5 days to get an appetite again and I guess I just don't want to go through that discomfort? Even now, I have a hard time eating lunch during the work day because I'm not high- and I usually don't eat until I'm home and have had time to smoke a bowl and let myself relax. Sometimes I do worry that my co-workers think I have an eating disorder.
3. My anxiety- Weed has seriously helped me so much in the past with my mental health. I'm a very anxious person, and I put immense amounts of pressure on myself to be successful in every aspect of life. Throughout school, if I was worried about something (assignments/tests) I wouldn't eat, sleep or think about anything else but that. Without smoking I wouldn't be able to focus long enough to take a shower, make a meal or do any of the other basic human things I need to live and function in life. This is something else I thought would magically disappear once school ended (surprise, it didn't!). I feel this way now that I'm working as well, even when I'm off I'm constantly checking my emails or responding to clients well beyond my work hours and it seems like weed is the only thing that helps me step away from work and relax.

Anyways, I'm hoping some of you out there may be able to relate/share some advice about what helped you quit! I have kicked an addiction before (cigarettes) so I believe I can do it again. On some level, I feel like never thought I had an addiction to weed, or even that it was possible. I think that was denial though, and maybe if I viewed it in the same way I viewed cigarettes it would be easier?",3
2020-07-14 07:45:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hqzzmt/the_loop_of_the_fog/,The Loop of the Fog...,"Maybe if I text it out and own it, I’ll feel ashamed enough to change. 


The sun rises. As it slowly starts to fill my room, I pull the covers tightly over my head to block it out. After anything from minutes to hours, I reluctantly force myself to get out of bed and take a shower to feel a bit less foggy. 

I turn the faucet to cold in an attempt to clear the fog further. 

I feel a frustrating mix of how “today is finally gonna be the day”, trying to mentally convince myself that I can do this and running through the 10000 reasons why I want and need to quit, and battling how completely exhausted and dull I feel from the night before. 

I get out the shower, and head into the kitchen. I don’t feel hungry. 

I remind myself how one of the reasons I smoke is because of my appetite, but convince myself that if I let enough time pass, I’ll get hungry without smoking. I go to the store. I maybe go for a run or do some stretches. Eventually, I get hungry enough to eat. 

I sit and rewatch That 70s Show for the millionth time with my meal, trying to not think about how hard the day will be. 

I finish eating. Now what? 
I don’t know what to do with myself. 
I don’t want to start working, 
I don’t want to work out as I just ate, 
I don’t want to read, 
I don’t want to walk, 
I don’t want to talk to anyone....
but I’m not entertained. 

Maybe if I have just a really small joint, and relax for like an hour, then I can start my day nice and chill. 

I roll.

As the hour drifts by, the phone rings. It’s work. I ignore it, maybe I’m in the shower. My email dings. Late payment. I’ll think about it later, don’t feel like it now. Trying to start my day relaxed. 

Phone rings. Its my mother. Ignore. I don’t want to talk to her high. My sister texts me for the 100th time asking if I am ok and telling me the family is worried. It makes me uncomfortable... the anxiety surfaces. I don’t want to confront it. 

I roll. 

I get hungry. Cooking is so much effort. I’ll watch one more episode, maybe I’ll forget I’m hungry. Another hour goes by. I snack to satisfy the craving. Not good enough. I need to eat... but I don’t want to prepare anything. I throw something in the oven. It doesn’t look appetizing. I don’t really want it. I know I need to eat though.. 

I roll. 

I eat. Finish the other half of the joint I rolled to stimulate the appetite, to help with digestion. Now I feel a bit better, but I just ate so I need to relax. I’ll watch some tv. Phone rings. I answer. It’s a friend or a family member asking me if I am ok as I haven’t been replying. I’m fine. Just didn’t sleep well and slept in. I’m sorry. I’ll do better next time. I’ll keep my ringer on. 

Now I feel anxious again. 
For a split second all the responsibilities and obligations I promised to uphold in the last years decide to swarm to the front of my thoughts. I can’t handle it, but I tell myself I want to. If I just smoke one more small one, I’ll be fine to manage this stuff. 

I roll. 

It’s almost evening by now. Dinner time. I suppose I wasted the day anyway so it’s not like I’ll be productive. I’ll just chalk it up to a “rough one”. I make up whatever convenient and not yet overused excuse works with whoever tries to contact me or make plans for why I can’t... if I reply today at all. 

I eat dinner. Another episode with the meal. Now that I just ate I need to relax. Since the day was a waste anyway, I might as well smoke one. 

I roll. 

It’s around 10pm. Bedtime. I don’t feel satisfied with the day. In fact, I feel like complete and total crap with myself. I didn’t do anything to exert my energy, so I’m not tired. I need to get to sleep though...I know this has to stop. I hate feeling like this. I hate who I have become. I hate that I can’t seem to function normally. I want to though. I want to be better. I’ll try again tomorrow. Tomorrow will be the day for sure. This can’t go on. Tomorrow I will finally take that step. I’ll smoke my last joint for sleep, and tomorrow I’ll wake up and I’ll change. One more episode and a smoke to unwind. I’ll sleep better.

I roll. 

The sun rises...",5

I have smoked weed morning til evening every day since I was 16, so I recently made the decision to stop, as tapering etc just does not work. I want to start posting here regularly as I didnt realise this was such a common addiction to have, even though ""wEeD iS nOt AdDicTive"" lmao. 

Anyway i'm currently on day 5, and doing fairly well. I read a self help book around a week before quitting which really helped me go about this the right way so I have been eating well, exercising, meditating, reading and focusing on a course I recently applied for to get some sort of career going for myself, as weed has masked any productivity or ambition I once had. Withdrawals have been there, night sweats, no appetite, feeling sick, diarrhea, not getting great sleep but all in all im doing fine with little to no cravings because im so determined to not be the ""stoner"" ever agan. 

I do have 2 questions though, more aimed at long term users who have successfully quit.

1- I have developed a bit of a cough, seemingly from my lungs trying to clean themselves out because its mainly to cough up mucus. The thing is, there seems to be brown specks in it and it has me a bit worried. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this just resin that has been trapped in my lungs or is it something more serious?

2- Smoking weed has completely shot my short term memory. I dont necessarily feel any less intelligent, im getting on with my studies fairly well, but when it comes to things like conversations with my girlfriend or family members I can literally say a few sentences, get sidetracked by what the other party has said then completely forget the point I was trying to make. Same as before, has anyone else experienced and recovered from this or have I wrecked my short term memory permanently?

Any help or info is greatly appreciated. I look forward to hearing from you all.  :)",6

I started smoking weed at 19 and smoked daily until a month after I turned 20. Then I began to have (what I now know were) the biggest panic attacks I’ve ever had in my life. I was shaking, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, my breath was shallow, and I thought my throat was closing. I just accepted that I might die that night because going to the hospital would be too embarrassing. 

I stopped smoking for about 6 months after that because I couldn’t do it again. But slowly I smoke a little and then a little more, and eventually I was back to smoking every day. Sometimes I smoke and feel completely fine and other times I smoke and feel like I’m dying (tight chest, heart racing, throat closing). It’s like playing Russia Roulette. This is still continuing today. 

I tell myself not to smoke because I know it will push me into a panic. I mainly worry in my panic that I won’t wake up if I go to sleep because of my chest. I feel like I’m torturing myself. 

I can’t admit to my friends that I want to stop. I’ve told my mom but she doesn’t think it’s a big deal. She even enables me sometimes.

What do I do? My high self tells me that she never wants to get high again, my sober self doesn’t listen because “it’s not actually that bad”. Am I actually going to die if I keep this cycle up or am I just endlessly inducing panic attacks? I want to quit but I don’t know how. I feel helpless.",1

Our parents were in the city but pretty much let us do our thing because we all regularly went to church services together and guess that made us trustworthy to them but anyway as is the case for many of us, conversations led to ""I know a guy"" and 2 hours later we were at a fair high as hell on the ferris whee listening to scar tissue by RHCP and it was a match made in heaven. i quit a few times but over my 11 years as a smoker i've taken some tolerance breaks from weed and it was never too horrible. Maybe a few withdrawls the first 2 days but nothing a good meal couldn't solve. As of 2 years ago my tolerance got so high on weed that a 2 gram blunt got me high for about 30 minutes and since I'm a gamer i discovered dabs were the way to go. Started hitting about a .1 dab a day and that quickly turned into 1.5 grams a day with constant re medicating to maintain a high. During this time I was dating my soulmate and while she smoked occasional bowls and joints with me when we started dating and even enjoyed the occasional microscopic dab before bed here and there. I suffer from depression, anxiety, Bpd and was born with some neurological spinal problems so even though I was tremendously loved by my girlfriend, I had tremendous insecurities as she is very attractive and confident in comparison. Before dabs i was proficient in so much, had a successful career as a personal baker for some influential people in NYC. was a teenage amateur boxer with 14 fights and 10 of those won, good swimmer, cook, and extremely passionate. Well it came to a halt with a foot injury that almost had me lose my foot and required a few months of taking it wasy. I went back to school for Automotive technology and held a 3.5 gpa and things were going amazing. Enter the dabs. Somewhere along the lines during my recovery i discovered dabs due to a classmate that lived 2 minutes away from campus and would invite me over to sesh. Then we started playing online together and it became a religious ritual to get high as soon as we got home and get online taking additional dabs about every hour or so. I lost track of myself slowly. gaining weight, forgetting everything, sex drive decreased, productivity went down the drain with the excuse that i was recovering. Recovery came and I got back to work but ultimately I became a totally different person than who My Ex had fallen i love with and though she tried talking to me multiple times i never fathomed quitting(nor did she ask me too, she wanted balance and more focus on bettering ourselves before getting high) I convinced myself that she was trippin because i was working and paying the rent and we were doing decently financially. Eventually she got tired of the routine of work and then dabs. She hated how I prioritized getting high, how i made empty promises and how unreliable of a partner I became. It's been 4 months since she left and it's only now that I realize how much my unhealthy obsession with concentrates pushed everything away from me. Lost a girl that would literally tear up when she saw me smile and who stayed the with me through all my medical BS and it was after everything that I noticed how much I took from myself for my instant gratification. Today I'm in Mexico at 4 am with major withdrawals as I quit cold turkey last Friday packed up and left to my mommas house and have slept 4 hours since. Concentrates are not even a thing here and even though i feel a tremendous urge, it's finally clear that I have to heal myself. That while a healthy person might be able to indulge casually, I was not able to maintain my integrity and I failed myself. I need to accept that I have to forgive myself and stop being so hard on myself. suicidal thoughts are going down. My ADD is better, CLEAR HEAD(i forgot what if felt like to not always be high or sluggish and coming off a high,I was able to eat healthy today and I can finally see a horizon where I can learn from this and be a better person for myself and anyone who may come into my life going forward. I want to live and taste and feel. I'm in tears as I type and i have not felt this type of empathy towards myself or love towards myself in years. I'm bigger than my drug habbit, There's so much to catch myself up on. I'm so glad I found this subreddit.

\-I once spent $500 in 10 days in a spree of buying pens, throwing them into the sewer claiming I would get sober, and then the next day buying more. None of this resulted in sobriety.

I don’t want to sound arrogant or egotistical but my entire life people have told me that I’m really smart. For a long time i didn’t believe them, for a long time i smoked weed to escape my problems and be distracted. As a kid i knew i was somehow different from the other kids, like i was so much smarter and i held myself back for so long. My uncle who’s the only father figure in my life told me, while i was at my peak withdrawal period, that he thought i truly was gifted and that i could use my intelligence for something good in life. He told me he believed in me when i revealed my life long goal of becoming a lawyer.

After that i was determined to stay sober because i would need 100% of my brain to be able to accomplish this monumental goal. Furthermore I wanted to use this gift i have, one many do not possess, into thinking of ways to help the world. I have a deep love of humanity in my heart and i finally realized that i wanted to push my pessimism aside and let optimism take over once i started getting sober. I don’t believe I’m at 100% yet, maybe hovering around 70% at the moment. But i do believe once i reach 6+ months sober I’ll be on top of my game, being as smart as i possibly can be. I know I’m not perfect but i try to be the best version of myself that i can be. I want that for everyone too, not just myself. I wanted to thank this subreddit for helping me get through this rough patch and arm me with the tools i need to move forward. People are so amazing i believe, i know there are a lot of bad people out there in this world but i know they’re simply misguided.

Humanity and life can be beautiful, all we have to do is try.",4

2020-07-14 01:11:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hqvg54/only_1_year_clean_but_thank_you_all_from_the/,"Only 1 year clean, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart","I've used to smoke everyday for the last 10 years. 

&#x200B;

I started when I got to college. The first 2 years, I limited myself to smoking only Friday and Saturday nights. Third year, my girlfriend at the time and I both bonded over smoking and it turned it into an almost everyday activity. 

&#x200B;

A few years later when she cheated on me, I started smoking ALL. Smoke before work, vape during my lunch breaks at work, and dabs as soon as I got off of work. I thought I was the exception to the rule since I was still a top performer at my job despite being high all the time. At some points, it didn't even seem like there was a difference between sober me and high me since I smoked so much and my tolerance was so high. But for some reason, despite the tolerance, I kept smoking.

&#x200B;

Then on one day while I was high and scrolling reddit, I came across this sub. I started reading some of the posts here and I am ashamed of myself, because my first thought was ""weed is good, the people posting at just weak!"" Again, still ashamed I ever thought that.

&#x200B;

I must have known internally, that in fact, I was the the weak one. I kept reading post after post. Seeing the South Park post about weed, hearing personal stories, etc,. All the stories and posts made me realize I was living my life at the lowest possible level to just get by. I used to be such a motivated person before weed.

&#x200B;

Still unsure at the time if I wanted to quit weed, I told myself I would go a week without weed to try and convince myself I wasn't an addict, which I was. The first 3-4 days were hell. I could barely eat anything and I was irritable, but I would come back to this sub and read more stories and it kept me on track. 

&#x200B;

A week turned into a month which turned into half a year and now a whole year today. In that time, the motivation boost I received from not smoking weed, aka, being sober, motivated me to get a new job that paid twice as much as my old job, moved to a legal state and still have no urge to smoke.

&#x200B;

I hope someone can read this like I did a year ago and realize my/their life wasn't on the right track. Constantly smoking weed destroys your motivation to better yourself. At best, it should be a treat for people who made it rather than people who are trying to make it.",17

This is just my rant to really just get life off my chest.

I think I can say this has been one of the worst months of my life and it has been destroying me mentally but also motivating the shit out of me because I have never worked hard in my life. Working to get out of this shit situation I’m in. 

So here is some backstory. I’m 21 M living my mom. I smoke weed daily and have for pretty much been doing that for the past 3 years with few breaks. It has definitely affected me and is 100% the reason I still live at home. Weed has made me ruin a lot of good/GREAT opportunities through self sabotage or being to high to do anything. I have just always put off quoting because I never really wanted to, until now.

My girlfriend at the time 1 month ago cheated on me and we ended up breaking up. That hurt but I wasn’t a great or even good boyfriend so I understood and don’t want to hold grudges so try to just let things be as they are. The problem is she works for my mom, who works from home. So pretty much my ex is at my house 30-40 hours a week. I didn’t want her to keep working there but she is so broke that there was really no other option. My mom doesn’t know the full story because I don’t think she needs to know things that happened between two people in a relationship but I think she kinda knows. But the fact that she still works here kills me and has completely detached me from my mom. We never had a great relationship but when this all went down there was a single moment where I could feel my love die down a little bit. At least trust is out the window.

So i have just been working and trying to make money to GTFO out of here so that I can try to regain my sanity back. Everyday here sucks but I need to keep saving so I can get my own place. Unfortunately I have a pretty large weed addiction and am spending around $60 a day on weed especially in the last month since this all been going down. This is why i am quitting. Quitting to make myself a better person. Quitting to save money and not just spend it all on weed. Quitting so that I can start to live and become myself again. 

I’m definitely a little nervous about the withdraws because I know I’m going to be crying a lot this first week. A lot of emotions that I am going to have to deal with. Not really looking forward to that. Today starts day 1. I will keep this thread posted as I go along. If your reading this thanks for just listening to me rant.",4

Of course I found a joint on the floorboards, one I undoubtedly had given up for lost at least a year ago. 

I must have held it in my hands for over an hour, turning it over and over, thinking about the things I’ve lost because of smoking, especially in the last year. 

And yet after all that I smoked it. And I was filled with instant regret, memories of the love I’ve lost, the people I’ve alienated and the wrong paths I’ve gone down. 

When I woke up the next morning I flushed the rest of the joint down the toilet and began day one again.

2020-07-13 17:39:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hqofqh/feeling_dismayed/,Feeling dismayed,"Hello all, I am a 21 year old man who began smoking at 16. I’ve decided to quit since smoking has lost its novelty entirely, and since I’ve really been feeling the negative health effects especially since I began using more frequently for a number of years. This may end up being a rather elongated and rambly post since I’ve got a lot of thoughts about my newfound desire to quit; so I’ll include a tl;dr at the end anyone who wants one, I guess.

The real reason I’m making this post is because I’m feeling rather disheartened by what has become of me post my high-frequency usage phase. Before I began using to the degree that I did (well, before I began using PERIOD), my cognitive abilities were rather advanced. I could speak, read, process information, read backwards and understand the text perfectly, analyze text, all with relative ease. 

Now that I’m at the tail end of it all (I hope), I feel permanently dulled. I no longer read like I used to, speak like i used to, the whole 9 yards. Rather; I feel dim-witted. Makes sense considering all of the research that has emerged over the past decade about adolescent-onset weed usage and IQ decline. I most definitely feel like my cognitive abilities have tanked considerably; and this thought hurts me. 

Even before using pot; I was a VERY anxious person. Any little thing that could possibly set off my deepest fears absolutely would. Now my anxiety is even worse imagining that I will never be able to understand anything like I used to. Its even got me feeling like I should take the time and pay the exorbitant price for a clinical intelligence test just to see what damage I’ve done.

I guess my penultimate motive for posting here is to receive feedback / anecdotes / thoughts and see if my fears are ultimately just a byproduct of an already ailing mind. Again; sorry if this post seems directionless or overly rambly; just wanted to get some thoughts out of my mind and into the void. Thanks for reading

tl;dr – I fear I’ve irreversibly damaged my cognitive abilities from starting weed usage at 16 on through to now, at 21 years of age. Is it worth it to worry about it as much as I do currently do?",5

This is another one of those stories about relapse, but this time, it's mine.

I had made it sober for just over a year. I was going to have a party and everything for it. But then coronavirus hit, and all sorts of things starting to change and unfold, and I was struggling, similar to everyone else.

For some reason though, I decided that I wanted to try smoking again. Just for fun. Just with my friends. Just on the weekends. Just because I don't like to drink, and I was always sober at parties. Just because... there was no real reason.

I went to the dispensary. Bought a pre-roll because I had thrown out my bong and grinder and everything long ago. I felt awkward and out-of-place in the dispensary. I'm sure I looked like every other customer to the strangers in there, but I felt like I was doing something wrong.

The first time I smoked it, I was okay. I didn't smoke very much, and I didn't get too high. Maybe I knew how to pace myself now. 

For the next three weeks, I only smoked on the weekends, and I was able to stay at a pretty good level. 

Then there was last night.

I smoked a pre-roll with my girlfriend, and I think I smoked too much.

We were sitting on my bed watching TV when it began to hit me. I had the most vivid flashback I've ever had since \*\*it\*\* happened.

I could see what their face looked like. What their voice sounded like. The angle at which their neck was turned so their head was facing me. I could see what their hair looked like. I could feel what I felt in that moment.

The moment played over and over again as I sat there and my legs began to shake and my jaw began to quiver. My girlfriend jumped up to go get my panic attack medication from my desk, but there were too many pill bottles and it took her a while to find the right one. When she finally found it, I took the pill and continued to shake as I tried to control my breathing. 

I began to sob as the flashbacks didn't stop. I realized something-- I was so fucked up and high for those months that I was abused, that the flashbacks became clearer when I was high. That was the state that I was living in for 6 months, so being high took me right back there.

Eventually, the medication kicked in and I began to calm down enough to be able to go to sleep.

I stopped smoking because I had smoked to much in the past, but I didn't realize how much it was all tied to those 6 months. I had stayed so high during that time so that I could survive it. When I was high, they couldn't hurt me as much.

This was a bit of a ramble, but I needed to vent. I think I'm going to quit again. It's not worth triggering those feelings. It was awful.",4

I remember I was full of energy and pretty intense, getting my kicks from teaching myself to play guitar, writing poetry and being out there in the world. I wonder if I got self conscious because I have to say I was loud and kind of crazy. So I found that weed calmed me down. But now more than ever I NEED that energy. I am a student, a mom, I can't afford to make life harder than it already is. 

Last week I had a nice 4 day stretch without weed. It wasn't in the house. Mood swings: check. Sadness:check. Extreme fatigue:check. Happiness :check. I had also not had a drop of alcohol in 10 days too.

Well of course as I am cleaning my basement I find a container of weed and papers I thought I had lost. I didn't throw it away. I smoked it starting on what would have been Day 5. 

All weekend I paid attention to how I felt when high. It deadens my senses and slows down my brain. 

Last night I gave myself a little party on my own. Drank 2 if my favorite drinks (sparkling white wine and Campari) and smoked the last 2 joints of my favorite strain. Honestly, I had a great time, on my own, laughing, knowing I was done with poisoning myself, looking forward to meeting my pre-party self, feeling confident that without poisoning myself I can kick ass with this life of mine!

Such a shitty cycle that just kept me basically stuck in my room and made my whole world so unbelievably small.

But I'm sober now. I spontaneously caught up with an old friend the other day, it was great. I spoke to another friend I haven't seen for a while and I was able to genuinely say 'let me know when you're free and we'll catch up' and mean it. Bought a nice new bike on a whim, and actually ride it, whenever I feel like. I chilled out with my housemate and his friend tonight just casually. I enquired about a tattoo booking now the studios are opening back up and I was able to take the appointment offered to me without having to think about it. The next day one of my besties is coming around with her daughter and new bf for lunch at my place and I'm actually excited about it, not trying to tetris in being able to even do it and dreading interactions with some guy I don't know and a teenager. Then I lined up a date with a really cool seeming guy for lunchtime the next day at a café I like in town. 

That's a whole weekend line-up, just like a NORMAL person, just living life. Haven't been able to just do shit like that for so long it's honestly like 'oh that's something other people get to do, not me'. But screw that, I DO get to hang out with with mates and make appointments and go on dates and eat at cafés and buy myself nice things and live my goddamn life. Weed was like a prison. A warm, heavy, comfortable prison. I'm glad to be out of prison finally.",626

These last three years have completely fucked me up. 

In 2018 I got diagnosed with metastasized breast cancer. This was a smack in the face, but I found the courage to better myself and move forward. I’ve been treated for a year with active treatment (operation/chemo/radiation) and since then (‘till now) I still have passive treatment (immunotherapy). I lost a lot of friends during that time, which gave me quite a lot of trust issues, which I’m still coping with. Thankfully I’m responding to treatment well, but I still have to go for scans every few months. During treatment, I saw the fun everyone was having on social media; the festivals, swimming, parties etc. I couldn’t go in the sun during treatment and for a year after treatment (my skin couldn’t repair itself at that point because of the treatment). So I figured that 2020 truly was going to be my year. Boy, was I wrong.

When corona hit our country, I was becoming more and more anxious with everything locked down. I didn’t want to be ‘locked down’ for a third year in a row. During treatment I held on to the ideas and dreams I had about the things I would do in 2020. It really helped me through back then. Now I felt there was a huge empty hole in the place where I had my plans and dreams. 

Then my grandmother got corona. She was already partially paralyzed and it didn’t look good. She eventually passed, which had me spiralling down further. I honestly had trouble picturing the future and it broke me a little more. 

Then my mother called and told me she had bad news. First I thought she had corona as well, but she didn’t. Her cancer had come back and had metastasized to her liver. The oncologist told us that she was sure my mother lived at least another year, anything more would depend on her reaction to the chemo. 

My mother has had cancer before, ten years ago. My dad died when I was 4, so she was a single parent. She told me a few years ago that when she was diagnosed, she begged for another ten years, just so that we (me and my sisters) could grow up and get out of the house before she passed. This year it’s exactly ten years ago.

My mom called me a few days ago, voicing her concern about me. I can’t deal with negative emotions very well, always used to smoke/drink them away. And right now I’m at a point where so many things are going wrong, that I really feel like pushing those emotions further away. We talked about it a little bit and it hit me, I don’t want to regret this time, I want to be there in my mom her last years. Plus I’m really scared I’ll cause my own cancer to come back because of my unhealthy habits. So I quit everything. Today is day 4 and it’s really hard on me. 

The group of friends that I've met this last year are the first new friends I made since treatment. It used to be nice, but something has changed. Two of them seem to be annoyed with me and I feel like they are trying to push me out. I do tell what is going on in my life but I don't really show my emotions. After the news about my mom, they were supportive. Then at a birthday of one of them a few days later one of them was really annoyed halfway through with me for some reason (nothing happened, a few hours before she was acting nice). Now the two seem to be ignoring me, and a few others of the group seem to follow them. This hurts, a lot, since I thought and also voiced to them earlier this year that I'm really glad I found them after losing so many people.

I’m at a point where I honestly have a lot of trouble seeing a happy future. I know there is, but I just can’t see it. A lot of times I feel like there is something wrong with me, that I deserved all of this to happen to me (also because of things happening when I was young, it just keeps adding up). I've been working so hard on becoming a better person and shit keeps happening...

Has anyone experienced this feeling and what helped you? Could really use some tips at this point.

tldr; Had cancer, this lockdown is my 3rd year 'locked down', grandma passed, moms cancer is back and not looking good, friends are abandoning me (again). Need tips to deal with quitting even if life is messed up right now

Edit; reading it back it all sounds a bit emo, sorry. But I really need to share this with someone.",9

Need help in sharing my feelings about marijuana with my family.,"Hi everyone. I have been struggling to quit smoking has for the past 3 months. I don't want to detail my feelings about getting high,  but I can honestly say that I want to desperately quit. I dont want to blame weed but I have been chronically procrastinating on major activities which could be deleterious to my academic life and career. Also, I haven't made any progress on any of my personal goals. 

I am currently living with my sister and brother in law. My BIL is a great guy and also smokes pot. He is still very productive though: wakes up early, exercises, works hard. But I'm opposite. I wake up in the afternoon, have no physical activities for past one month, procrastinating on my responsibilities, etc. 

The thing is for the past 3 months (since the lockdown) he and I have been smoking up together daily. I feel that I want to stop but, its not been possible for me. I'm fact, I feel that I initiate our smoking sessions more often than he does. 

How do I go about sharing my feelings about getting high with him ? I am certain that he would support me, but I feel nervous about revealing my weakness. And by admitting that I am having repercussions of this habit would make it real. 

My sister also chided us on how much we smoke, but she has stopped caring at this point since everything seems to be okay. By admitting that I need to stop it would confirm to her that I was indeed addicted. 

I am also afraid of making things awkward. Since my BIL is easily able to manage being high and productive, he may not understand my situation. Or am I just over thinking ? 

Can someone tell me how to go about this? I want to wait desperately.",3

I used to only smoke it during weekends and social events. Smoking is a thing that I do a lot with my friends, a fair share of them are stoners. However, they’re stoners with corporate high performance jobs (so do I), so either they dose it perfectly, or accepted their addication, or they have trouble coping with it like I do.

I noticed that my brain fog is getting worse at work, I oversleep for work (and I'm a lucky ass not having to clock in the morning), I even forgot a deadline for a project (and I blame the weed) and I started to use it during events that are already fun but seems boring now without smoking weed. Gaming, tanning on the beach/at the park etc.

I also feel like I have been using it as a way to deal my anxiety and depression. Especially during the lockdown (there is no lockdown anymore by the way). For a while it was good, but I noticed it’s getting more counter productive and that the hangovers the day after are getting worse and worse.

I live downtown in a major Dutch city (not Amsterdam) in the touristic city centre and I have 3 coffeeshops around me within a 5 minute walk.

Yesterday I went to the coffeeshop for the very last time. Picked a pre-rolled joint of my favorite weed (Lemon Haze) and put an end to it after smoking it. 

I want to stop the brain fog. I want to be clear in my mind again. I want to stop weed probably influencing my meds and get the motivation to be quirky and sharp back again. On the moments I used to smoke, I will do something else to enjoy myself (some tips on this? I am a gym member at Anytime Fitness so I can do this).

One downside: by the end of this month I will be going abroad on a trip with friends. However, those friends are avid drug users during vacations so I hope I can deal quitting weed while everybody around me does it.

I hope you guys can give me tips and support/motivate me to make me keep on my quitting streak! And do you some apps that would be continuing my quitting streak?",5

I (20M) started smoking at the age of 17 after my friend offered me some due to extreme stress from family issues. It was my main source of escape from life and “helped” me with boredom. I’m fairly active (I go the the gym 4 times a week), work and hold a job, am in a long term relationship, have a strong circle of friends, and perform well in college (4.0 GPA). I never really felt I needed to quit until about three weeks ago. I was binge-watching Hannibal and I took a massive grav of some strong stuff. I got into a thought loop and had a momentary psychotic episode. Since then, smoking, vaping, and eating edibles began to give me mild to strong panic attacks, something I had never experienced before. I tried to lower my intake and try different strains, but no dice. This is day number 2 now where I have not consumed any form of cannabis. On the way home tonight, I had a massive panic attack on the interstate (going through downtown Atlanta) after involuntarily hyper-fixating on the skyline. I see visual snow fairly often and my perception is constantly “very fast”. Bright lights are also very intense. Given the high speed, massive buildings with neon signage, the scale of the city, and the infamous driving habits of Georgians, it was harrowing to say the least. I’m hoping that abstaining from weed will alleviate the problem and I figured I’d share my experience here, just to get it out for one and maybe get some tips on how to cope with withdrawal. I don’t crave the stuff so I’m not itching to smoke more, but I hope that I can either eliminate or be able to manage the short/long term withdrawal symptoms.",2

At 20 I switched from oils to bongs and flower. That's when I really became an addiction and I didnt even realize it until I bought oil again and realized how different it was. 

I want to stop. I hate being dependent. I only smoke st night to help me sleep.... and I have so much anxiety over not being able to sleep without it .like so much. And idk why. 

I recognize that weed (in particular flower out of bongs/bubbles etc) keeps me stagnant in life. I have severe anxiety at times, and weed is always there so I can ""deal with it later"". It masks my depression. 

It serves a purpose. But I have an addictive personality and took advantage. Now I'm dependent. 

I tried quitting cold turkey several times. I think I will rely on my pens to help me sleep/ get used to not having such an intense high. I need to switch my mindset from ""let's see how high I can get"" back to ""how much do I need st this time to address a specific issue"".

School wrapped up and I had nothing to do during quarantine. No responsibilities and all of the time in the world made me decide that getting high could be fun and make it less boring. And admittedly it did that pretty well.

I had went from only smoking on the rare occasion with friends to smoking myself to sleep every night. I realized since I started I had smoke half an ounce (which I realize isn’t a huge amount but I’m a light user). I’d make plans to do while I was high and they’d never get done. I’d just sorta sit there watching YouTube and eating junk food until I drifted off to sleep. 

Also whenever I’d run out I’d have terrible sleep as if I had developed a dependency on it. Anyways after half an ounce I’ve figured this isn’t a habit I like and I’ve decided to stop smoking by myself and now only while at a social event. I should have no problem quiting because it hasn’t drastically impacted me. I guess I’m posting here so I feel like I have a need to follow through.",4

Anyway, the list. 

1. My prime concern is this *dullness* that i feel and i know you guys have expressively addressed it, but I'm hoping to get a better idea of how I'll have this even after I quit. For reference i have smoked every day about three blunts a day for about three years now. I don't know if the time or frequency of my smoking will effect this amount of time, but i imagine it does.   

2. Weed was an amazing crutch for me at first, it suppressed my depression, anxiety, concerns, doubts. However it quickly took something else, my will do to well *anything*. I just have less energy and it seems with my now sky high tolerance, it no longer keeps a lid on the emotions i use it to ignore. Did your energy return in conjunction with the loss of the mind fog, or do you feel it returned earlier/ later? 

3.  All my good friends still smoke and will probably continue, and i don't think there's anything wrong with that, some of the brightest and best people i know are potheads, but because i know so many I will frequently find myself in situations where it is there, and available. I understand the whole power of will thing, but how do you guys *coexist* in an environment where your vice is everywhere you are?

I got out of the military last year to go back to college. This has been something I’ve felt pretty good about. Even today. I’m glad to be out of the army and back in school. My state had just legalized marijuana medically the year prior to me getting out of the military. I had never smoked before, but it didn’t take me long to get my medical card. I went from never smoking, to getting a vape pen for daily use. It was nice but I grew to enjoy flour much more. Starting in 2020 I began smoking weed pretty much everyday. It was harder to get motivated for school. It was harder to maintain relationships. It was harder to remain disciplined. It was harder to keep my mental health in order. This leads me to now, looking back on my life with weed these past months. As much as I try to convince myself that weed isn’t that bad, or that it helps me remain calm or less stressed, I have run out of arguments for my weed use. It’s been a detriment on my life if I’m being completely honest and I don’t want to smoke it anymore. We all have our things that tie us down to our addictions. It’s up to us to realize how to untangle that knot. My car smelled like weed today because I put all of my stuff in it. My sister was in the car, and I couldn’t stop thinking about how smelly it was. I stopped to get gas and dumped my stash there, bong and all. I’m done with with weed.",21

Took me and the psych doc more than a year to find a combo that worked.  The idea that I've got to find a new combo or that there's nothing that'll work scares me.  
  
Oh and because I've had such a shitty attitude the 1 or 2 friends I still had are ignoring my messages.  I can't blame them, I'm a shit person and a shittier friend.

So, today, day 2 of being moved out I am just having SKY HIGH anxiety, lack of apetite and insomnia. I played tennis with a friend for TWO HOURS this late afternoon, 85 degree heat, and am still wired extremely jittery, even though I just slept 4 hours last night. The breakup and moveout alone is stressful. And there was... strong words said and unintentionally scary actions taken the last week of me living with him, which had me in panic attacks or tears daily. To top it off, one of the roommates in this Airbnb I got for myself told me she just flew in from Miami 3 days ago so I am freaking out that there is coronavirus in our apartment.

All I want to do is go out, at 11pm in my new, somewhat dangerous neighborhood, to buy a bowl and lighter and light up the bit of weed I brought along when I left.

Its funny, I brought the weed just to maybe liven up videogames or a walk a week or two in. I didn't realize that I needed it to feel normal and sleep at night. Its pretty scary that I am this jittery/freaked/craving it. After some google searching I found this sub and could just use some support.

Having adhd my relationship with weed started quite late (luckily) with 23.
Back then mostly smoking with my girlfriend.
Then I got a vaporizer and usage slowly creepeed up.
More and more during the week in the evenings.

Then I started using it earlier and could still function well 
Using it in more and more situations like work.

One of the biggest downsides for me is that  it decreases rem sleep. 

My solution was to smoke earlier in the day which sometimes still ended in me vaping in the evening 😂

 the last few week's my usage has been the highest it has ever been. Daily for a couple weeks and many days starting after breakfast. Didn't really enjoy it anymore. 

I never thought it's a big problem because compared to many my dosages where still pretty low and I am functioning pretty well. 

However the lasts months I didn't move forward but backwards in many aspects. Less meetings with friends, less exercise, nutrition got worse. 

I am still doing OK but I am starting to wonder which part weed plays in that development. 


I took the recent chance of a weekend trip and now on day 4 of quiting. Just watched a series where many scenes got me emotional which made me realize the effects it has on me might be much greater than I realize. 

It was planned as a tolerance break but now I am thinking maybe I should quit all together.

How did you make the decision it's time to quit? Having a hard time commiting to it. Since I still see some potential benefits of using it.",7

I've been smoking for over a year daily, I had forgot what it felt like to be sober, I wasn't productive at all, I didn't like doing things unless I was high, I even pushed back a lot of really important people in my life because of it. And I quit cold turkey, last month. One of the hardest decisions I've ever made in my life. Is it worth it? **Hell yes.**

My schedule was to wake up at 3 pm, eat, get high, take a few classes, get high at 6-7pm, eat dinner, get high at night and play games until 4-5 am. Then I'd make myself some breakfast and get high again to watch some series and finally sleep at 7-8am. That was my routine daily for over the whole pandemic.

I felt useless, my body wasn't doing anything and what was once a young and healthy body was becoming a laid-back stoner that only eats junk food and doesn't do anything else than to play games and watch series. **I HAD TO CHANGE.**

The first week I suffered from some severe withdrawals with nausea, lost all appetite, irrational change of moods, insomnia, depressive state of mind and **ANXIETY big time**. It was hell and I started to believe there wasn't a solution. Then, went to therapy in hopes of changing myself.

This is where I spoke about my weed addiction and came out clean to my mother about it, this is where privately I spoke **to weed** and told everything I needed to say.

**""I'm a slave of my mind, and my mind is slave to marijuana, and I thank you for all the memories. But it's time to change, to evolve. I want to be free, I want to be a better me""**. I cried a lot while speaking this words because they had weight to them. I felt like I was making such a big decision, and there was no going back about it.

I started writing a log about each day, how I felt, what I did, what did I want to do, speak about the changes I've felt through the days. This helped me understand my process a whole lot more and helps me looking in retrospective of how things can change in a few weeks.

At the start, the days felt so long and I had too much time alone with my mind, and my anxiety was killing me. I started meditating, and the more I did it, I began learning **how** to meditate and control my thoughts. It's not about avoiding and trying to make the thoughts disappear, it's all about not judging them and letting them be. (Headspace is a great app for those of you who don't know where to start.)

As a few days passed, I started running and doing some workouts. This, singlehandedly, made me feel so much better about myself.

Running became priority in my week, and I do it consistently (this is key). After running, I felt this rush in my head and body, this kind of high that always makes me feel SO ALIVE, I wanted more of it, I started thinking about running a lot more and going out and doing exercise, just me, my headphones and the pier in which I run.

Every day started feeling different, I was writing about it and I could see how different each day was becoming, I started dreaming again and having some REALLY vivid dreams which told me a lot of things about myself and my subconscious.

I am also fortunate enough to have a very supportive girlfriend and very good friends who have been with me since the start of the process. She also, embarked on a journey of not smoking so I never feel alone which has helped me a lot. (She wasn't addicted and didn't even smoke frequently but it means so much)

**The best things I am enjoying because of being clean currently:**

* Improved self worth and my self confidence.
* Huge boost in motivation to improve my life in other ways like running, meditation and eating healthier and more.
* Have managed to get out of other habits such as biting my nails and nicotine every day completely.
* Clarity of thought and peace of mind. Far more patience and understanding with things.
* Better sleeping patterns and much more in control of them.
* Feeling connected with my relationships (Family, loved ones, friends).
* More money and spending it on a lot more cooler things, than just weed.

I still do feel temptations from time to time, but the best thing you can do for yourself is having the **control** and the balls to say NO, to stay sober. It isn't worth getting high and lose all of the beautiful things I've had the chance to feel again.

**I LOVE Weed, but part of loving it, is understanding how to live without it as well.**

Stay strong, stay sober, stay safe. Trust me, it is worth it. It's so fucking worth it.",15
2020-07-12 17:32:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hq2iqw/i_am_starting_to_believe_that_quitting_will_come/,"I am starting to believe that quitting will come at an awfully ""high"" price.","My best friend and I have smoked pretty much solid for 12 years. I rent a room in a house where there is a communal garage that is used by our friendship group for smoking weed, playing video games, watching TV, etc. The room, financially speaking, is a super deal. Easily 50% below market rate. Another member of my friendship group also rents a room in the same house.

I am currently on day 7 of quitting weed and day 4 of quitting nicotine, both cold turkey. I have had similar withdrawals to others documented here, they aren't my issue.

My issue is that I am on a much different wavelength and energy level to the rest of my friend group who still smoke in that garage. Unfortunately, they are also my only friends, and whilst I hoped they would follow my example of their own volition, and quit too, that has not been the case.

I have been trying so hard to keep things cool between us, especially during the initial 30 days. I read stories on here that stoner groupa had to be abandoned in order for quitting success, and vowed that would not be me.

Unfortunately, I feel like I am failing in that aim. Being in that garage, or even playing video games, does not interest me anymore AT ALL. I am not triggered to smoke by the environment or having weed around - rather, I am just straight up bored of it, but my friends don't want to go out or do anything else!

My local pool reopens on the 25th, and I hope to make daily use of that once it does, and start filling my day with other activities. My concern is that doing this will only cause the divide between myself and the rest of my friendship group to grow further.

Your thoughts and advice appreciated!!",2

I was mulling it over thinking ""maybe I'll just hide it incase I need it""; I kept thinking about flushing it but couldn't quite bring myself to do it. Finally I got the resolve, went into action and held back the overthinking until the job was done.

Like many others I started in my late teens. At first it was just fun but in college it became an addiction. I had few friends in highschool and it was an automatic in with so many people in college so it was an easy choice. It certainly didn't help my grades but I had already become completely apathetic towards school by middle school so I didn't care. I was able to slide by and eventually earn my CS degree after dropping out once.

There were periodically little hints that I should stop. One of the first friends I made in college told me that I wasn't as fun to hang out with since I started smoking all the time. She was right but I was hooked and too many of my friendships were predicated on getting high together. It felt cool to be a stoner and I prided myself on my ability to smoke tons of weed and still be functional. Then there was another friend who stopped smoking with us because he preferred being more active outdoors. But for the most part it was easy to rationalize my addiction - most of my friends smoked and I was still getting passing grades.

Looking back I should have caught myself when I started smoking alone. That was where it went from ""just a social activity"" to what is arguably an addiction. After I left the dorms the social aspect died down a bit, of course I still got high with friends, but I kept up smoking all the time. I took small breaks here and there, even quit for a month but always went back sooner or later.

It's hard thinking about all the things and people I missed out on because I was so stoned (and all the money that went up in smoke). College can be a significant opportunity to learn who you are and what you want to be but for me it was a smokey haze. It definitely set the stage for an aimless, apathetic life which is where I find myself today. I mean, I do well job-wise, but I'm just not happy. I don't accomplish the things I am interested in. I can't laugh and enjoy life like I used to. Even shorter breaks bring this back to some degree but that quickly goes up in smoke when I resume my addiction.

I think my biggest motivation for quitting is the desire for progress in my meditation practice. I follow a particular program and I've seen many of my peers progress but I stagnate in spite of my dedication. I'd like to become a meditation and breathwork teacher but I don't feel like I have the confidence until I can manifest the positive results in myself that will serve as inspiration to my future students.

Anyways, I'm mostly posting to help keep myself accountable and vent a little. Maybe parts of my story will resonate with others and inspire them to quit or stay quit.",26

I am learning to work through stressful situations that pop up without weed as my crutch. Most importantly I have admitted that I cannot use weed ever again, even a little bit, or I will sink into full blown addiction again.  This is well established after many experiments. 

My key to success is to have a full arsenal of support in place, and to use it willingly.  I have a supportive sister I can call anytime.  I have a wife and daughter that are here for me.  I have this sub.  I have a therapist that helps me with strategies for working on myself, my anxiety and depression.  I am attending a once per week zoom support group meeting. I have a medical doctor that has assisted me with prescribed medication and I follow her directions. 

In the past I tried to do this on my own with zero help from anyone.  All I can say is it didn't work.  I need and now accept all the help I can get.  I now view it as a serious medical issue.  I would be crazy to try and recover from cancer on my own, right?  I'm that serious this time around. 

I've learned that success, if I really get honest with myself, depends on a willingness and a desire to walk away forever.  If I say I just want to quit for now, or hey maybe someday I can use responsibly, I will go back to full time use.  If I'm willing to kind of let go but not completely, I will go back.

What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”

So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.""

Obviously, this is about getting out of bed. But I feel like it has a lot in common with what we struggle with here. Weed stops us from doing what we need to do. We werent born to simply ""feel nice."" Staying in bed all day, or getting high, are simple, short term pleasures that stop us from obtaining more long lasting goals.

When I say habitually, I mean it was my only hobby. I smoked before breakfast and then another 2 or 3 times before even leaving the house. I was having about 15-20 cones/hits per day. Ive suffered from extreme anxiety and depression for most of my life and psychiatrists are also in belief that I've developed borderline personality disorder from childhood traumas, in the process of actual diagnosis though. So, I already experience dissociation and losing touch of reality and I'm extremely hypersensitive and overly emotional.
Before I decided to quit smoking, I was approaching a nervous breakdown. I had insomnia from doing overnight shifts at work, my best friend was my ex boyfriend who I was in constant disagreement with and I realised I was severely underweight (5'7 weighing 48kgs) which caused me to develop an unhealthy obsession with gaining weight. The main reason I decided to quit was because I knew how much it was fucking with my metabolism and diet.
I thought I'd try to taper off, slowly cut back to the point where I was only smoking ~ 20% of what I was before. And then the psychosis began. I ended up in the ER after begging my mum to take me to the hospital because I wanted to kill myself, and if I was alone that night I probably would have, or at least hurt myself really bad.
My thoughts are in a constant spiral. I can't remember anything, I'm constantly thinking ""what did I use to think? How did I use to act? What did I do before weed?""

Honestly i never thought I would end up here, but the things I read are realy motivating me.

Here's my story:

I'm 35 years old, have a beautiful wife and 3 awesome children. I've been smoking weed and cigarets since I was 15 years old. (on daily base around 1.5gr/day since i was 18) I grew up in a little town with lots of friends and we started smoking all toghether. A lot of them are still smoking... 

I've always done well at school and graduated without any problems from university. I'm a sports teacher at an elementary school for more then 10 years now. I never smoked when i had to teach, because of the responsabiltity you have for these kids, but always smoked my first joint right after i came home from work. And yes I'm ashamed of being a ""stoned"" teacher!

I've tried many times to stop smoking weed but always failed. It seems like i need it to sort the things in my brain out and relax after a busy day. 

I always thought weed would never control my life, but it did...

I woke up and the first thing that was on my mind was to smoke a joint. Sometimes in the weekend i secretly smoked a joint at 9 am. :O If i didnt had weed, my mood was realy bad and I called everyone up just to get some weed. i started avoiding places where i couldnt smoke weed. I hated it to go to family dinners etc just because i couldnt smoke there (i realise that now). My wife doesnt smoke and disagree with it but ""it's your life"" she said. 

As my kids grow older they hated it when i smoked (sig or weed, they dont know the difference). And always asked me to quit smoking cause it stinks and they are afraid i will die soon if i don't stop. That's why i made a promise to them to stop smoking in the summervacation. I mentaly prepared myself for weeks and last sunday i started my new life and threw away all things related to smoking...

Im now 7 days in the proces (no more weed or sigarets) and I must say it's not an easy thing to do. I sweat a lot, have moodswings and my dreams are out of control! But i realy want to be clean! Everytime I have a difficult moment i think of the promise i made to my kids. I still havent smoked for 7 days not even a pull. (makes me proud) 

I realy hope i can keep this up, because the half of my life i spent it with weed. Also my social life is difficult now because almost all of my friends still smoke weed. Im gonna try to avoid going to places where they smoke (also told my friends why and they understand) but i miss my friend atm...

I'm glad i could write this down cause it helps me again in the proces. I see things pretty negative now and dont know how to live my life without being stoned but they told me it's al worth it! 

Does anyone have tips for me to get thru this dark period and how long does it take to live a normal life (without thinking of it)?

Thanks for reading and if you're in the same situation as me: LETS DO THIS TOGETHER!

Sunny winter day in South Africa :)

Apologies in advance for a long post.

I've been reading as an unregistered member of Reddit for a while, since i stopped smoking i guess, I was turned onto this subreddit by Michael Griffin and his website [(](https://thislucidlife.com/)Thislucidlife - I read the rules and believe i can't post a link to his website) which actually gave alot of good content into the effects of marijuana etc..

This is a thank you, and hopefully my story can inspire someone else. I am not worried about starting again, because i feel strongly that it's behind me now, even though it hasn't been that long since i stopped, my mindset i believe is strong enough to maintain this.

I, as some of you, am a long term ""heavy"" smoker of this herb. My story starts at about 13/14 (high school) and i've smoked for over half my life now. I am now 31 and would be classed/have been classed as a ""functional stoner""

My childhood was rough, my father went to prison when i was 7 years old, my sister was only 3 weeks old at the time he left the home. My mother managed another 18 months after that, working many jobs to try and ""save"" our home and what meager possessions we had left. Until that point we had a ""wealthy"" upbringing, being my brother and myself. My mother has subsequently told me about an incident when my father kicked her in the stomach when i was in the womb. So although she has told me many times i was the only child born out of ""love"" that is clear evidence that it wasn't quite the case.

Anyways, life does go on, we ended up losing our house, our car, everything basically and had to move into a room luckily at a friends house. 

at the age of 10 (+-) I walked in on my mother who had now developed a significantly harder drug problem of her own. On this day she was smoking crack in the lounge with her then alcoholic boyfriend who was in my life for way too long. At this same age I made a decision to A) Never use hard drugs or chemical drugs (Nothing chemical) and B) try and shield my brother and sister from seeing what i had. I'm not sure if the latter was the best decision as they both have problems of their own - My sister being drugs and my brother, although he uses drugs, his problem is more that of Alcoholism.

Anyhow, as i said, i started smoking at around 13/14 and I am now 31. I left high school without a Matric (Or graduation i guess). I moved out of my mother's house at 18 because i couldn't get along with my family or bare witness to the travesties occuring in the household with said family members.  
I got myself educated, got a bursary at school to get my technical matric, i got an apprenticeship and qualified in roughly half the time it takes everyone else. 

With all this said, I believe i have been ""successful"" in many people's eyes. I got married to a great woman who loves and supports me wholeheartedly, and i bought my house shortly before my 25th birthday.

With the changes to my situation, I determined this was not the end of the line for me, and made a career change into IT which is far more lucrative. Since then, my determination etc has brought me more job opportunities, but a job is a job is a job. Ultimately, I am far more driven than that, and if i come across as incensitive I apologise in advance, but a job doesn't work for me. I have read personal development books since i left my house to try and be the best i can be. This has left me with an inner fire burning and the realisation that ""All wealthy people have their own businesses""  
So a year ago at the start of July i left my job to start my own business.

Bring me to today, where i decided a few weeks ago to stop smoking weed, even though my wife (and friends and other people etc) tell me i can function perfectly fine while being a stoner. I've had this feeling for maybe the last couple years that it is severly limiting my abilities.

I've read many stories about severe cases of withdrawls etc. I don't experience any of that. Maybe, if anything i suffer with night sweats, a bit of boredom and sometimes i really want to smoke to feel that ""stoned"" feeling. I have just immersed myself in my work, trying to grow my business which was ""barely scraping by"" and hopefully that will happen. I understand that stopping weed alone won't make that difference, but it might help me, and i will never know unless i try.

I don't really remember life before being a stoner, as i was way too young, and i honestly cannot tell you how long i have been an ""everyday"" stoner. Having my own house with a yard etc, I've been a long term grower of my own herb which made top quality smoke basically meaningless to me. It just became the norm. 

Currently my indoor grow tents etc are packed in my cupboard, and im unsure whether to sell this as i won't get the money back that i've spent, maybe someone can give me some advice for this.

Having quit smoking cigarettes after 17 years roughly 10/11 months ago, weed was the next logical step. If I'm honest I am glad that i've stopped. My focus is getting better and better, I'm not as ""tired"" constantly and I am definitely more focused on getting my work done, learning new things to increase my skillset etc.

My mother and myself have a good relationship now, she's clean for many years now, except she still smokes cigarettes and feels that she can't quit that. Especially considering that my sister ""drug problem"" kind of lives with her, and my sisters child lives with her so at 58 years old she takes it hard, 58 year olds are not designed to raise a 2 year old.

TLDR: to be honest i hate giving a TLDR - rather read, or don't if you're not interested. But if i were to give a TLDR then basically, it's my story and the inspiration i acquired from reading this sub to post my story. Thank you to those who have quit before me and shared their stories.

Here's to many years of sobriety ahead - ""Cheers"" with my sparkling water :)",1

I need and want to quit. I’ve tried in the past and never got very far. I can give up though, because I had to for a surgery and I did it. Then started again.

It's funny how my brain still makes me think about weed though. Just the other day I had a thought loop that started with me thinking about how far I've come in a week, and how motivated I feel to not smoke anymore. And then I started to think about how I can never go back, ""maybe just one joint for movie nights, or at a party for the after sesh. That couldn't hurt"", which led me to thinking about how if I were to ever go back it would just end up leading me down the same rabbit hole I've been trying to escape for years now. 

And then I realised that I was unconsciously thinking about weed for the last 30 minutes, despite me being confident about my current week long streak. 
But that's okay. These thoughts are normal to have; you can entertain an idea without accepting it. 

My anxiety is still there, as is a part of my brain fog. I've signed up for the gym again and I've been spending my weekends keeping active and staying outside of the house. 

I've also been playing The Last of Us and watched Mandy, Trainspotting 2 and Knives Out this past week and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I was able to feel immersed without needing weed and actually felt more immersed than usual which has broken a huge stigma for me; that I need weed to enjoy any form of media. This was a blatant I have been telling myself for years. Only now have I realised that weed has actually stunted my attention and given me the illusion that I have been immersed when I have only infact been high. 

Here's to having another 10 days sober, peace and love to all of you - keep fighting the good fight 💪",4

2020-07-12 03:28:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hpqfmm/last_time_forever_tomorrow/,Last Time Forever Tomorrow,"I have extremely mixed feelings about this.

On one hand weed has basically kept me alive since I was 14 (22 now), but I’ve taken breaks, “quit” before and have even been forced to give it up by a now ex girlfriend, therapist, and family members at different times. However, even then I never truly stopped wanting or using it like 5-6 out of the 7 days in any given week. I would sneak hits every once in a while during the times I was “off weed” or just blatantly lie that I wasn’t getting high to those I had holding me accountable when I couldn’t hold myself accountable. 

On the other hand, I’ve come to realize weed has also slowly been destroying my life in more ways than one. I’ve been sober from alcohol for 26 days now after drinking everyday since graduating high school and that feels f’in great. My mind and body have felt a lot better even with some heavy, depressing sh** that has been compounding in my life since March, and I don’t want to numb the pain with a drink anymore. I do keep getting high everyday though because I have always viewed weed as more of an alleviation from my pain rather than another form of numbing it.

This has been the wrong mindset for someone such as myself with an extremely addictive personality and a few different mental illnesses. I’ve realized now as much as weed has helped me it’s also been a huge hindrance on my forward progress in life. I won’t get into the fine minutia of what has gone right and wrong with my usage, but between my current sobriety from alcohol and having my last session with my therapist this coming Wednesday and the fact that I’m moving to NY from my hometown in CA on Friday, I’m truly ready to quit using weed.

Tomorrow night will be the last night I get high. I will be hanging out with my “best” friend to basically cut ties with him and my drug abuse. (I put best in quotes because we’ve grown apart the past year as I’ve struggled immensely with a lot of what I’ve mentioned earlier and some other things and he’s always just been an enabler to a lot of my poor choices and poor aspects of my personality that I’ve fought tirelessly to improve.) I truly can’t wait till Monday and hate to even say I’m going to get high tomorrow night, but it’s what feels right to me right now to do it this way.

I will be dedicating my time being sober to focus on my craft (I want to be a chef which is why I’m moving to NY [Funny that I’m getting sober to work with what are usually a bunch of other addicts like myself for the rest of my life]), meditating regularly, and getting physically healthier. I’m definitely going to miss it more than I have missed getting drunk, but damn it’s going to feel so good in a month, in 6 months, in a year and beyond.

Maya Angelou said, “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I recently came upon this quote in one of my first days sober from alcohol and it viscerally hit the core of my being. A sober me, is a better me. That is my mantra. That is what has kept me from drinking and what will prevent me from getting high after tomorrow. A long road lies ahead of me, but I look forward to seeing every part, every nook and cranny, of that road with MY OWN eyes.

We had an argument in the evening, it kind of came out of no where and we don't often argue so I've been thinking about it all night. A lot of things were mentioned but the main point was that our weed use as a couple is out of hand, it's messing up our finances and stopping us from doing just about anything else. I definitely agree with this but I'm at a loss, because we've tried to quit together or taper so many times... and it never really happens. We've attempted cold turkey, setting a timer between smokes, baggying certain amounts for each day, waiting longer for the first smoke etc and I dont know why but it feels impossible to do this. We've smoked together for our entire 5 year relationship, it's become a ritual and a way of relaxing together, it holds more significance than I ever intended. 

I just need any advice on how we can approach this. When one of us breaks, it's impossible for the other to stay strong. I have a hard time getting on with my real responsibilities when I'm quitting/tapering, he becomes quite irritable and angry, neither of us want to eat and it just becomes doubly uncomfortable with 2 people suffering from the same problem. 

I don't want to be dependent on a plant anymore. I don't want us to miss out on fun and adventure because all of our money went on weed. He said to me, ""I just want us to be better, I want more for us"" and I feel the same but I'm also so afraid :(

Any tips, advice or wisdom about staying strong in w/d or helping my relationship in this process will help me so much. Thank you for reading <3",7

I finished my degree in applied mathematics in spring 2019. When I was a sophomore in college, I made some friends in the same department that were brilliant but had the tendency to smoke while doing homework every single night. Soon after I started meeting with them to study, I developed an addiction for weed that lasted years. I didn't even think it was a problem at the time. Actually, I viewed it as a way to cope with 12+ hours of studying every day. A way to unwind and not take things too seriously. But, I also began to develop anxiety, depression, mood swings, and social isolation. I withdrew from many things I previously enjoyed and would only really hang with people who smoke.   


Now that I'm out of school, and I discovered many people in this subreddit in a similar situation, I decided it was time to see what life is like sober again. I'm so glad I did. My mental health is so much better. I no longer default to viewing things in a negative light. The fact that I have been able to abstain from weed the past month proves to myself I have maybe just an ounce of self-control, which has boosted my self-esteem immensely.   


It hasn't been and still isn't easy. I've noticed extreme withdrawal symptoms (I was a very heavy user, 3-4 sessions daily for 4 years). I get headaches every day and am extremely fatigued, with little motivation to do things. But, I know things will get better. And after reading so many success stories on this subreddit I believe I will have a similar outcome if I continue to push.   


Thanks to everyone who posted to r/leaves. You've given me the justification to improve my life in ways I never could on my own.

Hoping this will be my first and last Day 1.","I am a pilot. Because it’s a small industry and people know each other, I won’t go into any more detail than to say I fly jets out of a large city in the Eastern US and have been doing so for about a year. I narrowly missed being furloughed as COVID-19 hit our industry, and am extremely lucky to have my job.

Pilots are regularly drug tested. Most people have their number come up a time or two a year. I hadn’t smoked since high school, but I started up earlier this year. I don’t mean it as an excuse, but the combination of seeing years of my life and tens of thousands spent getting my licenses be threatened by COVID-19, the loss of a family member, and being reassigned to a city away from my family sent me into a pretty low mental state. Late one night, I stopped by a legal dispensary in the city I was staying, and, well, here we are. Not sure why I did it, just knowBig that I’m having a hard time stopping, even though I know the consequences.

I only smoke about once a week at this point, and never around the times that I fly. I’m stupid for risking my career, but I’m not an asshole and would never endanger others. But with the low threshold they test pilots for, that once a week can easily take a week to leave my system, putting me at significant risk for days at a time. Moreover, pot sucks my motivation to do other things, to learn new stuff, and just get out. So I need to stop.

Like the title says, if I can’t get a handle on this, I’m going to lose my career. Failing or refusing a test is the immediate suspension of your license, usually for at least two years (and even then you have to convince them to let you arrange a treatment program, find a new airline to hire you, which is unlikely in this environment, and deal with the stigma for the rest of your days). It takes a long time to get just to where I am, and being busted right now would be absolutely devastating to me and my family. I would probably have to leave my dream job for good.

I’m hoping that posting here will make my decision to quit feel more solid in my mind. And maybe provide some support to any others in aviation who are wondering if their alone. I don’t know if there are any other pilots or airline employees in here, but if anybody has any similar stories to help inspire me, or advice on what they did to regain control, I’m listening. My current pay is too low to afford professional help, so I’m limited to resources here and might try an online MA meeting or two.

I woke up feeling tired sure, but I felt on top of the world. I wasn't in the same daze I'm used to waking up with.

I keep it short and want to get to the point.,I don’t rly feel like i have to smoke which is pretty nice although at night times it’s extremely hard to get ready to sleep. Sometimes I lie in bed for hours until I can sleep and when I’m asleep I always have nightmares and wake up full of sweat several times. In the Last 3 days it happened all the time and I’m pretty exhausted. Is this a thing of quitting or could this have some other psychological reasons ?,1

2020-07-11 13:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hpe1vd/one_year_weed_free_today/,One year weed free today!,"I smoked weed daily for about 4 years (from 21 to 25 years old) and smoked frequently with friends for 5ish years before that. 

At this date last year I was in the hospital, hooked on an IV after a week straight of not being able to eat or drink anything. As soon as I got to the hospital and told the triage nurse what symptoms I had, she asked me if I smoked weed frequently, to which I said yes. I got sent into the back on a bed straight away, and after a while a doctor came and told me I was very likely suffering from Cannabinoid Hyperhemesis Syndrome. 

I had read a little bit about it before, but I’ve had issues with digestion and vomiting (which I take meds for) for a long time before I started smoking weed regularly so never thought the 5-6 times I was sick every month were due to the fact I was smoking too much marijuana... Then the doctor told me the only real way for the constant nausea, not being able to eat, and vomiting to cease was to stop smoking weed. 

I haven’t smoked since. 

I was so sick all the time I just couldn’t take it anymore, and the fact that the answer to my problems was so “easy” made me stop smoking right there without looking back. 

I can’t say I didn’t miss weed at all during the past year. I did. I missed it *a lot* at first, because it was such a habit for me and it was kind of like a safe place. I had to relearn how to do everything sober, like watching tv shows, drawing, sleeping, and eating. It was really hard at first, and I felt like shit and I wanted to smoke so bad sometimes, but on the other hand I could eat everything and not risk throwing it up after a few hours or the next morning, and that was the thing that trumped every other insidious weed smoking thoughts I had. 

I am also fortunate enough to have a very supportive girlfriend who helped me through the process. She also, on my request, took my weed box and hid it somewhere in the house. I haven’t tried to search for it once, and I am pretty proud of that. 

Overall, I’m really happy that I stopped smoking. I didn’t want to see that I smoked a lot and that I used weed to hide from my problems. I am also much more healthy now (I’ve gained weight, but at least it’s because I can eat all the things and not throw up every other morning ahaha) and I think about weed way less. 

I’m still nostalgic of the times I spent high with my friends and what fun we had, but I’m still able to have as much fun with them sober. I’m also happy that I dream every night now, it makes sleep that much more interesting! And I’m not ever paranoid that people will know I’m high anymore because I’m never high anymore ahaha. 

I feel like I’m rambling so I’ll end this here (this is so long I’m so sorry), but I’m really glad for this community. I’m just a lurker, but it helped me to see other people’s experiences with quitting weed and it greatly helped me to see that recovery is not linear and that having setbacks is okay. 

I wish everyone here the best and to have a great day!",279

So, I quit a few days ago because hashish kept me more depressed than I should be and I didn't achieve anything in the last few months.  


I had a decent control over my consumption last year and got a job. I didn't smoke except one spliff coming home and one before sleep. My anxiety got the better of me though, and I had to go on sick leave (I was trembling, sweating, unable to concentrate, and I was supposed to teach in this state. It was hard).   


Since then, I smoked a lot. My relationship wasn't getting better either (no sex since july 2018...), so I fell hard. We ended the relationship two months ago and after the first few days of sending missiles to each other, things calmed down.   


Now that I stopped smoking, she changed her behaviour. First, she wasn't encouraging at all, telling me ""yeah yeah, you're stopping. For how long ?"". Then today, she decided she needed to unload everything she had at me, telling me I was FAKING my depression, anxiety, and constant vomiting, just to be pitied.  


I'm so fucking pissed, she laughed at me when I went puking earlier today.   


It's already hard stopping but this context is not helping me at all, and I'd rather be stoned all the time as long as this heinous woman is in my home. I won't though but I'd be grateful for a few words of support from the kind strangers here !  


Good day to you all !",6

I live in NY so our quarantine phase was pretty serious between March and I guess June. Things are getting a lot better here now but when I was stuck at home, I found myself using my pen almost every half hour. 

Since finding this page, I’ve come to the realization that my issue is quite common and I definitely haven’t been using as much as others, which is what is motivating me to quit. I can see how much harder it is to stop after 20+ years of use based on some of the posts in here. The reason I initially started smoking daily was to ease my mind for when I slept at night. I was in a serious relationship at the time that really changed me as a person (This isn’t a forum about relationships, so I will spare the details. But I was constantly stressing and worrying about her. This experience left me an angry person. In all honesty, I feel like I became a dick).

Sorry for the introduction, just feel like its kind of important to the rest of this.

I’ve tried to stop using carts probably around twice, before using it again. Being stuck at home, I couldn’t find a good reason not to be high. Video games and movies were a hell of a lot better, until they weren’t anymore. I wasn’t really getting high anymore, I would just smoke to feel normal. I’ve noticed a lot of users on this forum started to feel the same exact way for a while. 

I dont want to rely on a drug anymore. I can notice the effects its having on my body, and they aren’t promising. I titled this post “I think I’m on my first SERIOUS Day 1” because this time feels different. I really want to quit but I know I’m going to need to use all the tools at my disposals.

If anyone feels like reaching out, whether that be to support me or your looking for support yourself, please do.

Just wanted to give an update. Things have been really improving for me. I feel a lot more confident and alert, there is still a bit of a fog sometimes but I've read that can take a long time clear up so I'm riding that out. Aside from the fog my clarity of thought has really increased. My eating habits have improved a lot. I'm a lot tidier too. I've been going running 3 times a week (I'm using the Couch to 5k App) and the days I don't run I go for a walk. I try to get 10,000 steps in per day. I don't always fully get there but it's always wayyy more than what I was doing when I was getting high every day. I've dropped around 5lbs and my jeans feel a bit less snug. I've been more sociable and where social distancing has allowed it I've been seeing a lot more of my friends - I also don't ignore their texts and phone calls now.

So I've noticed a lot of improvement in only around 3 weeks. In a week's time it will be a month and I'm really looking forward to getting that 1 month under my belt.

I’ve had a dark and interesting 15 years and weed has been a great bandaid for that as I go into my adult years. 

I smoked weed for the first time in 2016 as a 19 year old with my brothers.
In the early days of smoking, it really 
wasn’t an issue. We did it a few nights a week and had a great time. 

But that casual smoking very quickly turned into daily smoking. 
In early 2017 I attempted quitting, but my heart wasn’t really in it and so it didn’t last terribly long.
At the backend of 2017 I was away touring for 3 months, so not having any weed wasn’t an issue. I was away working doing what I love. 

Coming home from tour in December 2017 is where I would say my problems started. The unemployment began and the heavy daily use started. I was stoned by midday and asleep at 3am everyday.
This routine carried on till my next tour. And again. And again. 

In 2019 I picked up a job in the same industry. This was a massive help, but I was still looking at the clock counting down till I could go home and get high. 

Eventually it got to the point where I was ready to quit again. After I went all day and most of the night sober something clicked and the floodgates opened. 
I didn’t want be alive. I ended up in hospital. Took days off work. 
After a few days I got over my withdrawals and continued with work. My anxiety was through the roof, but once I was at work, I was happy. The drive there was the hardest thing.

I was sober for 14 days before smoking again. I convinced myself because I went 2 weeks without, I had control over my addiction. Ha. 

Well here comes 2020 and COVID-19. I lost my job. I have been sitting in front of my computer screens, high as a kite for the last 114 days straight. 
I love it. I hate it. I love it. I hate it.

I’ve spent the good part of 5-15 hours of everyday for the last 4 years high. If I wasn’t high within an hour of waking up was a no-go. If I was at home and awake, I was high.

Without going into detail, I lost $600 to a virus on my computer while buying more.
I’ve been waiting for this to happen to a year now and have always said “when it happens, it’s a sign”.

It’s Day 1. I’ve laid in bed all day watching TV because the thought of sitting at my desk, in my chair sober is so daunting. 

The reason I’m writing and posting this is because I want to commit this time. I’m ready to be me again. 
I lost all motivation for things. I became lazy. I became such an asshole to my family. 
I’m ready for a clear head and new lease on life.",20
2020-07-11 05:16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hp739f/relapse/,Relapse,"Hi friends,

I've smoked cannabis on and off for nearly 10 years now. It's been the past 5 or so years where I started smoking it every day, a fair amount a day, between 3.5-5 grams & dabs too.

I came to the point where my mental health had dimished so badly that I had to try and break the habit, to see if this would help lift my mood any.

I've found a lot of positives from quitting, I'm quite active and my physical performance improved drastically. I found pleasure in doing the things I used to do before I was just baked out my mind 24/7. I felt hope again, that my life could be better.

I still felt very cloudy in my head however which was very frustrating, and my short term memory is still diabolical. I get a lot of anxiety surrounding this, that I've just given it such a battering that it might not ever come back.

I went 4 weeks cold turkey, until I found a tiny bit of extract I'd been squirrelling away in the fridge. I was having a really low evening and ended up caving and dabbing it. I was very very close to pulling a whitey, anxiety hit me in the face like a brick, I nearly passed out a couple of times, safe to say it wasn't a good time. A completely different experience compared to my normal romanticised relationship with the plant. 

I'm now 3 days clean again and I'm really hoping this experience will help me push forward, but I'm worried that I've associated low mood and depression with getting high. I know I need to try and replace that action with something else, but when that's been your go-to for so long it's easier said than done.

I don't really know what the point of this post was but I just wanted to share my story, and if anyone has any sort of advice or pointers I will be eternally grateful.

I'm not there yet but I'm trying.

Lockdown was the worst because I was stuck home with about £100 worth of weed and nothing better to do, whilst living with a roommate that smokes weed everyday along with me. 

Now, I'm decided to quit for at least a couple of months, and I never want to go back to smoking every day - just occasional movie nights and stuff like that. 

Yesterday felt like I was on some kind of drug that made me anxious, hyper and pissed off. I baked a cake at 10am just to keep myself busy, because I still have loads of weed in the house and it's extremely tempting. I've found that mornings are the absolute worst for me, my cravings are super strong and I wake up with this weird feeling in my chest that doesn't go away until I smoke the first joint (happened every morning before I quit too). It's almost like I can't breathe properly until I smoke!

I come from having a joint as soon as I wake up, sometimes 7.30am! After that first one is done, I can't stop rolling every time the high comes down, approx. every hour after that. So I've found that if I don't give in during the morning and withstand the cravings, evenings are much easier. The trick is keeping busy and starting a new task everytime you get a craving! By the time you finish you most likely will have forgotten for a couple of hours. 

This is my first time seriously attempting to quit weed, other than just having the desire but not having the balls to go full in with it. So let's see how it goes!",26

I’ve had some v unpleasant side effects fro sertraline but there have been some positives. Reduced anxiety, calmness, lifted mood. Combined with fatigue, brain fog and nausea... sound familiar?
This experience taught how much I use weed to self medicate. Though this course of sertraline has been far from pleasant, it was still a lot easier to do things and function than if I was stoned. I knew I desired an altered state to manage my anxiety, but I always rejected medication, even though it’s much better suited for the job than weed...

My main problem is the insomnia, god it’s dreadful. Although the new meds are somnolents as well as ssri, so that should help.

Be it a week or a couple of months after, I always found myself using again. At first it probably was because I hadn't had the time to see how much it changed me and was getting in the way of my goals yet. 

So I just wanted to stop every now and then to avoid a hyperemetic state. But since a few months I decided to seriously quit, to get this substance out of my life.

And if you are now sober, was it easier to curtail your self-sabotaging and actually develop healthy lifestyle habits? 

I know a lot of people on here have changed their lifestyle, but did you encounter as much resistance? And for those that have not changed their lifestyle much, do you find that you self-sabotage just as much as when you were getting high everyday? 

I’m wondering bc for years upon years I’ve been trying to change my horribly bad habits and have made zero progress. I self-sabotage at even the slightest positive change I make. I’ve got about 10 days sober under my belt now and I’m going to try to change my eating habits here tmrw and start meditating and doing yoga regularly. I know it will still take work and focus, but has anyone found it much easier to do and maintain now that they are sober? 

I’m just nervous, bc I want these changes so badly but am afraid that even tho I’m not smoking anymore, I will still have just as hard of a time as before.

I guess I’m looking for a little hope/encouragement. I’ve tried so many times before with zero long term results. Hoping it will be different with weed out of the picture now. And I won’t be self-sabotaging as much, or for as long as I usually do.

I’ll start this story a year ago. I stopped for  just over two months when I started going on dates with this guy. I never had such interest in anyone and was never able to hold a conversation for long before this. I’m sure part of that was due to how strong of a psychological reaction I have to weed is. I get very quiet and recess a lot into my inner thoughts that I don’t feel comfortable sharing. So we got close quickly and I do think a lot of that had to do with me being sober. 
After he had asked me to be his girlfriend I started picking it up again. Because my thoughts scared me, I always wanted to quit, but I still found the sensation drawing. I told him about some sad stories of things I regret and feel like I missed out on in highschool because of it. Then by last saint patricks day we (116 days ago) he came home from work and I was pretty overwhelmed by the high. I couldnt listen to him because I was focusing on my own inner dialogue. I would just stare. He said I looked miserable. At one point I was face down on the bed asking for god to have mercy. He turned on the Nintendo switch and I felt better. In the next few days or weeks we had a conversation about how much it hurts him to see me like that and I promised to not smoke for one year. I do owe that promise and I owe my honesty. We’re set to be married in two weeks in his home state. 
I guess I just don’t respect myself enough to hold myself accountable. It had to be for him. I would write the day & quitting weed and doodle on the page in a notebook alot in college. I’d wanted to do it but never stayed patient through the discomfort. My worry is that I’m not doing it for myself. I’m motivated by fear. The fear of hurting someone I love. I want to keep desiring sobriety because the cravings are persistent and I need to find the way to burn for other experiences.",5

I quit alcohol 2 years ago, cigs quickly followed. Now, I want weed gone. I can do this. I never give up! 

I think opening an investment account and seeing what I could've been saving and making my entire 20s instead of sitting around spending money on weed to smoke.

I just want to remind everyone of how far you have come in your journey to becoming sober.. sometimes we can be so focussed on our goals, and what we idealise our futures to be, and sometimes don’t sit back to appreciate how far we have really come... 

Even if you have just gone the first day without weed, and you’ve been smoking for many many years trying to quit and this is the first time you’ve had a sober day all this time, then well done! Be proud of yourself, and always make sure to look back on where you were then compared to now. It will help you for the future months and years to come of your sober journey. I myself am 5 weeks sober today.. and looking back it, im proud as f** because this is the longest ive ever been sober since starting weed full time. remember to be easy on yourself.. rome wasnt built in a day, and neither will kicking this habit be accomplished overnight. It is not easy but im proud of everyone that is able to step up and take this journey on head first..

I don’t know how many days I have, I didn’t count last time I quit. I’ve gone the entire pandemic without smoking at least. Tonight I want to smoke. I’m really bored and lost in life right now. I just graduated with two bachelors degrees I worked my ass off for 5 years to earn. I thought I was going to get a masters fellowship to study a research project that I was really interested in and would have launched my career. Plus I would have to moving the fuck out of the US and my racist ass small town to attend a university in my boyfriend’s country. I found out this week I didn’t get it, and I feel stupid for even imagining a different version of my life where I could have started over somewhere else. I’ve kind of just been reeling all week trying to figure out what to do now. I’m having a hard time finding a job in my field. I’ve had 2 interviews in ~6 months of job hunting. The pandemic basically wiped out my post graduation plans, my backup plan, and the fellowship was the backup to my backup plan. I know so many people have lost their jobs due to Covid and I feel terrible for them, but I feel like no one is talking about college graduates who can’t find a job now. I can’t even file for unemployment because I never had a job that I lost. On top of that, I probably won’t see my boyfriend until at least 2021, because neither one of us are allowed into the others country right now. I’m angry and sad. And usually I would just smoke to feel numb, but I have to stay clean in case I have to take a drug test for any potential jobs I might find. And I’m still trying to retrain my brain to cope with these things in a healthy way. But I didn’t smoke today. And tomorrow I’ll get up and decide not to smoke then either. And every other day for the rest of my life. Good luck to everyone out there, it’s a tough time right now.",3

I know that relapse happens before the physical act of using and/or having another “episode” ( I have bipolar/ borderline personality disorder) but I feel too tired to stop it. 

I’ve been feeling this depression starting to creep in again, and I just don’t have the energy to change the course. I feel like sleeping all of the time, I’m starting to not want to shower or do self-care, I’m impulsively spending, I’m starting to emotionally eat, and I’m fantasizing about smoking cigarettes all the time. The next thing is going to be getting high, which the thought of wanting to get high is starting to simmer in the back of my mind. 

I have this strong sense of apathy starting to rise to the surface, and I have no enthusiasm to do anything but lay down. I’ve lost 50 pounds, and now I feel no ambition to continue with it as well. I feel some sadness, but no suicidal depression yet.  That suicidal depression is too much to handle, which is why I’m trying in some capacity to halt this progression. Once I start getting high, my emotions turn into a roller coaster. I don’t really know if I have it in me for another depression. I don’t know if I can stop myself from attempting suicide if I start to feel that way again. 

I just keep thinking about how dull life will be, and how I won’t get past my social anxiety. I like being comfortable and being in my bubble. I want to date, but I can’t handle the rejection. I feel comfortable at my job, but it doesn’t pay the bills. It’s like all I have to look forward to are weekends. I have to work Monday through Friday for the rest of my days, which I have trouble accepting. I just don’t see what there is to look forward too. I’m very happy that life only happens once; I would not want to repeat it. 

Weed and cigarettes made life tolerable and pleasurable at times, but  try to remember all the bad that came with it. I keep telling myself it will only feel good for a while and then I’ll end up right back where I started- never feeling like I’m getting enough, burnt out, and needing to quit.",1

I don't know if this is the lack of weed making it worse or what. I really don't know what's going on or if I'm just having an off day.  I always set the bar for myself really high and even if I had the perfect day I don't feel satisfied.

I'm supposed to work out today.  It's really important to me. I don't think it's going to happen.  Been trying to plan my monthly journal for days.  Don't think it's going to happen.  I need to cook and prep the healthy food I bought a week ago before it goes bad.  Don't think it's going to happen.  And I will feel like shit whether all these get done or not.

I’ve stopped 100 times for several days, 10 times for several weeks, and 1 time for a few months. I’m almost 35 and have been at it since 16. Pretty good job and MBA, but many regrets...

I feel like I was predisposed to being an addict of all kinds because I’ve not been good at sleeping since I was a little kid. Alcohol = sleep. Weed = sleep. Coffee/caffeine = wake up cause you can’t ever sleep.

I leaned on it to quit drinking and thought that it was okay because I had gotten away from alcohol. But it’s not okay. I’ve become apathetic, But complete sobriety brings on heavy depression; making quitting not so simple. The first few days are hell and I’ve been through them so many times only to return after a duration of abstinence. 

Why am I stuck in the cycle even though I am aware of it? I commit and then change my mind a few days, few weeks, or few months down the line. 

How have you stuck with it? What stopped you from going back like I did after a few months? What’s your life like now? Do you get any brain power back beyond the first several weeks/few months of quitting? I always tell myself that I’ll significantly reduce it, but completely stopping would be stupid as that kills all romantic and passionate feelings I have about life...

2020-07-10 19:55:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hp01zx/two_weeks/,Two weeks!,"Made it to two weeks today! I wanted to thank this wonderful community for helping me get this far, and to also give hope to those on their first few days that you CAN do this!

I’m 33 and had been smoking since I was 16. I’ve had several bouts of CHS, and my most recent episode left me so weak that I couldn’t be there for my wife, who is newly pregnant and had a scare that required a hospital visit.

I vowed then that I would never let my addiction get in the way of being there for my family. That while I’ve spent over half my life in a daze, there was no reason to continue that, and that I had the power to change that balance.

For a long time I was a “functional” stoner, but I’ve had rough patches in the past, and I’ve made some really stupid decisions because of drugs. However, the lockdown really screwed with me. I had so much hard work immediately thrown out the window, as every job/contract I had booked all of a sudden was gone with the pandemic. Everything felt hopeless, and I found myself even crying when seeing the empty shelves at the grocery store, or the empty streets and sidewalks. The world had turned upside down. In my head, I had no reason to not be high all day. Since the high wasn’t what I wanted it to be anymore either, even with some super strong strains, I started drinking heavily again too, even though my DUI a few years ago had scared me into respecting alcohol for a while again. Cue a really bad bout of CHS three months later...

I’ve had issues with both weed and alcohol for longer than I care to think, and realized I needed to give both up. I need to think clearly and rationally, and start facing the things that I’ve been hiding from emotionally and mentally for over half my life.

The first week was a little tough. There was a moment or two I wish I could take back (lost my temper with my wife) but the bright side is that it forced me to completely open up. Our communication is much more open, and she helped me confront a lot of the emotions that came rushing back after being numb for so long. How I felt broken and lost, and overcome with regret and guilt at wasting so much of my life’s time and money on something so... silly.

I’ve come to embrace that that’s just my life’s journey, to realize that my life is NOT over, and to accept the challenge to do better moving forward. Because that’s all I can do.

I did find a great therapist via my telemedicine provider. I had never tried therapy before, but I’m glad I jumped in - it was helpful to talk everything out, and I’m excited for my next session.

I also started meditating with Headspace and trying to get more and better sleep. I do wish the gym was open, but I’m walking when I can, and getting out in the sun and stretching my legs has been really nice.

I do feel my brain working a little better, and I’m fortunate to still sort of have a job. We’re working on new bookings, and trying to pivot to generate revenue however we can. It’s still scary to think about this year and next, but I feel more confident about being able to handle whatever comes.

I’m using the Grounded app and I’m excited to see my counter go up, as well as watch my little acorn grow. I tried a virtual MA meeting, but found it a little too impersonal. It was like the awkward zoom meetings I’ve had to have, except... worse. This community, however, has been a Godsend, and I don’t know what I would have done without the incredible support and well wishes from everyone here. Between reading people’s posts late at night when we can’t sleep, and the wonderful conversations on leaves chat, I feel much more of a connection. I’m excited by the victories we share, I empathize with the struggles we confide, and I’m heartened by the incredible kindness and generosity I read every day.

There’s been a few breaks in between, the longest at 3 months but all the others were maybe 2-4 weeks, once a year when I would visit my family for Christmas. I never smoked too much, an 1/8 would last me 2-3 weeks, but I would smoke every. single. night and recently discovered I’ve been suffering from pretty bad anxiety my entire life. It was going on medication after not eating and only sleeping 4 hours a night for 2 months that made me realize “oh shit, I didn’t have to be thinking like this my whole life??”. 

That was pretty recently and once the medication kicked in, it let me take a serious look at the rest of my life and how it was contributing to my anxiety. I realized my smoking habit made me a passive, boring person compared to who I was during that long break and before. I used to be adventurous and extroverted and the opposite of a homebody. But smoker me just couldn’t wait to get home, lay in bed, spark up, and binge Netflix and snacks. I realized that weed had played a bigger role than I wanted to admit in the downfall of my last two relationships and that it had mostly brought more negativity into my life than positive things. My last partner, when breaking up with me, referenced that all we did together was lay in bed and watch Netflix and YouTube (I would smoke every night and they would occasionally) and said we were becoming a boring married couple after only 6 months of dating. 

I told myself finally that I needed to quit. I couldn’t become the person I wanted to be if I continued on this path, and I knew that even short breaks would just put me right on that same path. So on Monday, I told myself I’d quit. 

But since then I’ve just found myself hearing this little voice in my head that’s saying “just take a break for a bit longer than 3-4 months, maybe you’ll be able to smoke just socially if you take a longer break. Maybe if you just promise yourself you won’t buy it or keep it in your house, you’ll be okay.” This way of thinking isn’t going to help me at all...does it ever go away? The cravings and desire to just veg out? Any tips on helping to avoid the bargaining trap?

My worst symptoms are wicked dreams and nightmares, night sweats, and insomnia. It doesn’t help that where I live is having a wicked heat wave right now (I’m talking 27°C overnight type of heat wave)...I’ve been a long time lurker and have tried a lot of tips - some help but I haven’t figured out a way to get out of bargaining mode.

Anxiety is very high at the moment because I went to the doctors on Wednesday because the roof of my mouth was sore as hell, found out it was an ulcer that I assume is from smoking too.. my mind is trying to tell me I have throat cancer or something but the doctor said he couldn’t see anything that would point to that. Kinda have a sore throat now and some sweats and chills but I believe it’s pretty much my body detoxing? 
I think being someone that overthinks a lot doesn’t help my situation either, with all the covid stuff too it just has me paranoid.

Hi everyone,
I'm on day 3 quitting after about 12 or 13 years of heavy daily smoking. I've been following this subreddit since Tuesday and was delighted to find how positive and supportive everyone seems to be! 

I'm 28, started smoking in my late teens. I don't necessarily feel like I've wasted my twenties as I've always been fairly functional, working jobs I'm passionate about and accomplishing some of my goals throughout my twenties. But what has always bothered me is my increasing lack of discipline in terms of pursuing passions that don't come with a paycheque. 
Basically I work my ass off (pre-covid) and then spend a good portion of my money and most of my free time getting stoned and staring at a wall... It also makes me very shy to new people and makes me emotionally numb to my romantic partners, so I haven't had a serious girlfriend since I was 21.

I've tried to quit many times and have always succumb once the increased anxiety/depression hits, and feel I can't talk to anyone about my addiction as my friends are all stoners and take it as a personal attack when I imply that weed has negative affects on my life and try to tell me that it's medicine (none of us have a prescription) and not addictive. When I mention my addiction to my parents they only use it to justify their own alcoholism.

I've recently moved cities and feel this time I can actually make my resolution stick without those distractions. I don't drink or smoke tobacco or do other drugs so I don't really have another crutch, but have wanted to be fully sober for a long time as many of the artists who inspire me most are sober.

Basically, I'm writing this post in order to hold myself accountable to push through the tough moments this time and gain control of my life. So I will go back to mainly reading posts here and listening until I have something helpful to add. If you've taken the time to read my feelings here, thank you.

This is what got me away from weed:

* First step: Make a list of things I hate about being a stoner. Keep that list handy and refer back whenever tempted. Add to the list anytime you think of more negative things.
* It's very important to fall out of love with weed. She is a physically and mentally abusive ex. Some people like to give him/her a name. Maybe just Mary Jane
* Daily journaling about how things are going with the quit. Getting circular thoughts out of your head takes a big weight off. Get things out of your brain (ram) and onto a journal (storage). This could be on paper or in a journal on your phone/laptop
* Start a calendar with X on each day of the quit. Or use an app that counts days sober
* Spending time here on /r/leaves and sorting by new. Reading and participating helps a lot. This is one of the biggest differences between these and all my previous unsupported quit attempts over the years. Helping others with similar issues is a great way to stay on track. Look into the subject of service and recovery
* make a list of things that have improved since I quit. Once you start to see real improvement a couple weeks in, write those things out and keep it handy. The positives on that list will be stuck in your mind if you ever relapse. This list of how much better/easier life is without weed will be very effective in ruining the high. If you want to get high again, you have to give up this list. There are a lot of positives once you get going, so it's a lot to give up. Keep adding to the list along the way as you notice new positives
* Stay busy with hobbies, interests, volunteering, projects, cleaning, organizing, walks, travel, daytrips, etc. This is really important. You need to dig deep and brainstorm a huge list of random stuff you are interested in. Variety is key. 
* Volunteering can be a great way to meet new people outside of the old stoner friends group. As a side benefit it helps distract from yourself and takes up idle time. 
* Watch out for replacement habits. Increased drinking, other drugs, shopping, eating, internet/social media. Your subconscious will be trying to get dopamine hits however it can. It's important to track and observer these things so they don't get out of hand. 


The first couple of weeks of acute withdrawal issues are tough. Here are a few tips.

* If possible, don't attempt to do anything too complicated or frustrating. You will get short tempered and want to run back to weed for comfort.
* watch familiar and funny tv or movie (for example The Office, Seinfeld reruns, bloopers, etc) If what you are watching is too challenging or complicated, it might peak anxious feelings and make you want to use weed to cope.
* avoid too much random internet and social media. Your brain will spin. Look into social media addiction. Check out /r/nosurf
* Find something easygoing to do like coloring, sketching, whittling, guitar. Creating something helps release dopamine in a healthy way. Little wins help a lot.
* Have some easy foods ready like after a sickness or surgery. Yogurt, jello, buttered noodles, saltines, mashed potatoes, rice, etc. Have some antacids or pepto handy too.
* stay hydrated.  Emergen-c has electrolytes and can be a nice alternative to water.  Soda water like LaCroix can be very refreshing and help break up unusual throat feelings that come with quitting.
* You might get stress and tension headaches.  Be ready with some Tylenol and ibuprofen. Yoga for headaches can be found on YouTube. Fresh air can help too.
* Go on long walks or bike rides with a podcast. It will ease anxiety and help wear your body down for better rest at night. It also counts as exercise if the idea of the gym or running is too much. 
* Listen to interesting podcasts or ebooks. They will distract you from yourself and help keep your circling thoughts at bay. Combine this with the walk or bike ride.
* yoga/stretching. Check YouTube for yoga with Adrienne for anxiety, stress, and headaches
* don't be too hard on yourself for losing patience and temper. Just try and catch yourself before hurting friends and family. Journaling about when these things happen can help you find patterns and give you more control
* expect intense, exhausting, and confusing dreams. Seriously disturbing stuff based on your deepest worries, fears, and secrets. I have experienced these many months into my quits
* try not to make any big dramatic decisions until the dust settles on your quit. Sleep on any big decisions changes if possible until a few weeks or months after quitting.
* if you start thinking if a bunch of overwhelming stuff you need to do, just put it all in a list.  This avoids worrying about all of it in a circular pattern. Look into the Getting Things Done concept from David Allen. The mind is great at thinking of things, but not so great with storage and recall.
* expect anxiety attacks and don't give them too much power.  It's just the addiction monkey thrashing as you hold it's head under the water.  Anxiety attacks should start to settle a month or so in. But then again, sometimes they come from real problems you have to face with a sober reality. Those problems will not fix themselves by quitting weed, so this anxiety could be with you for a while
* Be prepared for sleep issues.  For me it's waking up way too early.  A few weeks in, my sleep was much improved and I feel i am getting better rest than I have in years.  But sometimes I still wake up way too early. But hey, bright side that's more time in the day.
* some people get a lot of night sweats.  If possible keep the bedroom really cool and run a dehumidifier to keep the air dry.",86

While weed has never led me to the depths of hell that my lowest points as an alcoholic have, it has been just as responsible for my complacency. 

I know I have potential, but I’ll be honest everyone: I’m scared. 

I’m scared because I think this time is supposed to be the real one. It’s so hard for me to take it one day at a time without thinking, “Really? Like never, EVER again?”

I have smoked weed so much and so often since I was just a child and it seems I have forgotten how to relax without it. It became part of my personality. I loved it, and I thought it loved me. 

I’m sorry if this is dramatic or without purpose, I’m not even sure necessarily why I’m posting. I’ve thought more and more about actually going to meetings (I know it’s crazy, but partially thanks to watching Theo Von so much) as I’ve never received real help for these things, and I suppose maybe this is my way of getting that started. I wish you all the best of luck, a sober life can certainly seem impossible after what feels like a lifetime of living in a cloud. 

Ps. I have to give myself credit here, I’m a little over three months off of alcohol, I’m not sure of the day count as it’s my bajillionth time trying and it just seemed easier to ease off the pressure from counting.

The problem is I'm not fully able to understand what they mean by fog.

The whole corona thing made it much worse, I was consuming more and more to the point where I didn't even feel high anymore after smoking. And I got reaaaaally lazy, so I had to stop.

The first week was really bad with insomnia, profound sweating, no hunger etc. Since then these symptoms have faded away, luckily. However, it was then when my real struggles began, with extrem emotional instability (anxiety and depressive episodes) and what I call ""brain zapps"": From time to time, my brain just stops working for a few seconds to minutes. Really hard to describe, but it feels like if someone pulls the plug and I'm reset. I'm in the middle of a conversation and I just loose the whole context of what we were talking about. Same if I try to concentrate, even for a short period of time.

I've lost my job (due to the pandemic) a few weeks ago, hence I have to search for a new one. I'm a software developer, and my interviews will include coding interviews, where I need to solve problems and develop algorithms under pressure. I'm really worried, because my brain zapps interfere with my ability to do so (haven't had any problems when I still smoked). Even when I'm praciticing I barely get anywhere due to this. I'm not sure what to do against it.

Hence my question is if somebody had the same problem with your brain ""turning off""? If so, do you have any tips on how to overcome this?

My depression has unexpectedly ramped up and suicidal thoughts tonight have been real.,"Diagnosed with PTSD and depression, smoked for 10 years daily to “cope”. Sobriety has certainly brought me clarity, but sometimes it feels wrong. My life is a mess. I lost my partner of 3 years who was the love of my life, as well as his 2 young boys who were equally the loves of my life. He said with my depression and weed smoking that “there’s always *something* with you”...and he understandably left me. 

I feel a failure in many facets in life. I’m 27 and am yet to finish my degree, of which I don’t even know if that’s a job I want to pursue. I’m the “failure” of the family. I can barely financially look after myself and still rely heavily on my parents to provide for me. My main reason for not going through with ending it all is the reality that I would disappoint them even more.

The world feels like such a strange, dark place though...I’m truly struggling to see a light or reason to rummage deep and find a desire to keep going.

Tonight was just the worst. I work at a small pizza place, have for five years. I just couldn’t get ANYTHING right. My boss kicked me off my station because I couldn’t handle it. Then an hr later my manager brought up the kids that I miss ever so much (in a playful way) and I just fucking lost it.

I clearly made everyone’s night worse just by existing. My sobriety seems to be making me a shitter, clumsier, emotionally unstable human being.

Hope I can turn it around in my 30s.,"I'm turning 31 in 2 weeks. I've been smoking nearly everyday for \~13 years. I've felt dependent on weed as a way to self-medicate depression, low self-esteem, and basically as a form of escapism. I used to laugh off stuff like ""Reefer Madness"", but I feel like the cultural blowback from the ridiculousness of our nation's weed-panic has fooled many pot-smokers into believing weed is completely harmless as a natural herb, but it's not harmless -- anything can be overdone. 

Weed has completely killed my motivation. I know that I'm highly creative and have a lot of potential to make a career out of 3D art, but weed has made me so complacent that I never finish anything that I start. I know I have the talent to build an amazing portfolio, but I completely lack the drive to do so. Weed instantly makes me say, ""Fuck it. I'll do it later."" The moment I get high I will usually start playing video games or dicking around on the internet/social media. Before I know it all of my free time that I could be using for art has vanished. It is an endless, cruel cycle I've become stuck in. The shitty thing is that I always tell myself ""Weed can help me be more creative!"". This is mostly a lie. There have been moments of high-creativity, but what is the point if it kills my motivation and focus to follow through? 

I officially quit yesterday. Smoked my last bit and plan to get rid of all my paraphernalia. I was mainly inspired by my girlfriend who has been sober from alcohol for 3 years and just quit weed 3 months before me. She didn't push me to do this -- she was actually fine with me continuing to smoke. But enough is enough!! I don't want to look back when I'm 40 and say that I wasted my 30s. My main fear is that I will find out that I am just as unmotivated without the weed as I was with it. Sometimes I wonder if there is any point to me doing this or if I just will be needlessly torturing myself. 

I'm both excited and scared to see who I am once the cloud of smoke lifts. I anticipate this will be quite rough for the next couple months, at least. Thanks for any future support, and I hope to be able to share more with ya'll and to help others.",28

I was aware that most of my laughter was ""internal"" as a stoner; I'd watch stuff with friends that didnt partake and hear them lol when I merely smiled.

Every time I quit is generally for the same reason, (get your shit together, have ambitions, be better socially etc.) and expected quitting to just cause all those things to happen. right?

 I make it maybe a month at most before I realise that ""yeah I think more clearly, am more energetic and have better mood, but I'm living pretty much the same lifestyle as I was when I smoked, why not just smoke again because damn I just want to get high again even if it's in moderation (which always leads to daily smoking for me atleast) and quitting obviously isn't giving me all the benefits I thought would be promised.""

If you think about it smoking multiple times a week for months or years is going to drastically change your everyday thought processes e.g. what you perceive as rewarding, the way in which you communicate and your motivation. These will all be inclined towards what feels best when high which for many of us is getting the most pleasure for least effort.

With that said you can't just quit expecting your life to do a complete 180, **you also need to break your old stoner habits** and do things which push you out of your comfort zone which you are so used to, which unfortunately is hard work...

The good news is if you banish yourself from smoking completely you will be forced to find other more productive things to do, there will no longer be that option of ""smoke now, do it later"" and most of all no positive feedback loop of smoking, developing lazy habits and continuing to smoke more and more because your life is boring.

I’m up in Northern California with my family for the weekend (haven’t been out of quarantine in months since I live in LA so the escape is sorely needed) and just took a little walk out in nature before bed. And it was exactly what I needed. Because being out there and listening to all the beautiful sounds of water sliding by in a creek, walking through the trees, and seeing the sunset turn the mountains and sky a soft pink made me remember what’s real. And that I want to enjoy that reality every last bit before my time here is up. 

I saw a deer in a field that stared me straight in the eye. A chipmunk ran over my foot and I laughed out loud. It was all there to enjoy, and if I had been high (which my cravings were telling me I should be) I would’ve had that familiar feeling of “not being able to take it all in”. I would’ve been obsessively taking pictures so that I could just remember a few beautiful moments, instead of being able to truly enjoy every second.

I hope this isn’t too much of a journal entry, and I’m really living up to my username (lol) but I wonder how many of you also have this relationship with nature. It’s the thing that always saves me and reminds me to be present, but it can also be a big trigger. Often I’ve been in beautiful places and wished I could be high so it could be “better”. But that momentary enjoyment just means that beautiful moment won’t stick in my brain, and I’ll be constantly chasing the next one.

It feels vindicating to be at this point in my struggle, especially considering how many times I unsuccessfully attempted to quit. I feel like I'm on a hike, and I've just reached an epic viewpoint where I can see the trail I've spent the past year walking along, all the way back to the trailhead I failed time and time again to even start. It took me years to get any traction, and I've wanted for so long to be where I am now. Here are my thoughts on the past year. I hope you find them useful.

Firstly, my job isn't just a paycheck and a time-sink in between seshes anymore. I feel valued and I contribute meaningfully to my team. I finally feel *good* about my work. I was worried for a couple years that work would always be this dull thing I'd have to do in order to keep a roof over my head but still would hate. All the late nights smoking, poor sleep, and slow mornings were definitely holding me back from realizing that work can be rewarding and even joyful. 

My romantic life, while far from perfect, is also leagues better than it was when I was regularly smoking. I'm more confident striking up a conversation with women (or anyone for that matter) and I put myself in more social situations (although not so much recently given the pandemic). When I was smoking, I'd shy away from opportunities to connect out of fear of rejection, even though I was desperate for intimacy. I also am not a total pushover anymore when I do start dating someone, and I know when to walk away. When I was smoking, I'd be so desperate for intimacy that I'd bend over backwards for it, oftentimes sacrificing my personal values, which would eat away at me over time. Within this past year, I've had both *more* and *deeper* romantic relationships than I've had in the entire two years prior. 

I am able to immerse myself in the present moment way more now, and I really notice that with my hobbies. Before, I basically had performance anxiety/stage fright when doing any of my hobbies. I was doing them more so to impress others and I cared so much about how I appeared. This mentality also kept me from trying new things because I was so afraid of looking ""bad"". The truth is, no one gives a shit and the only person you should compare yourself to is whoever you were yesterday. When I was smoking I was so preoccupied with how others perceived me that it crippled my ability to enjoy myself.

It hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. I lost a best friend who kept wanting to maintain his toxic relationships with weed. I tried multiple times to get him to realize that weed was making him apathetic to everything around him, and therefore was exacerbating his depression. Multiple times, I felt like I broke through and he showed promise and desire to improve, only to fall back into the same cycle of monotony. I remember one time he told me that he felt like he wasn't making any new memories, and that he didn't have any fun stories from the past year of his life. Eventually, trying to help him became too painful for me and I felt like I had no choice but to sever our relationship.

Quitting weed has been both difficult and rejuvenating for me. I still get cravings every now and then, but now I'm fully addicted to this feeling of constant affirmation in my willpower. I feel like every time I say no it makes me a little bit stronger and a little bit more confident in myself. That's the best part. The growing feeling that I *do* have what it takes to thrive in life.

Long time follower of leaves (but made a throwaway to post), long time struggling to quit. Been trying to quit for about 3 years, my longest streak about 2 month and then my addict brain convinces me that I’m better and can handle a relationship with marijuana. 

Half a year ago I got an incredible job offer. It was a role outside my comfort zone but an incredible opportunity for my career. I took it and in 3 months got promoted to lead the entire team. All this while I was a “functional stoner”. Problem is, although I was “functional” and producing results - I really fucking hate what I do. Cue the start of a downward spiral into depression. This piled on and on and on. Instead of me addressing these feeling, I would grind away (talking 10-15 hours a day) and then smoke a bowl to cloud whatever inner voice tried to scream “you’re not okay!”

Earlier this week I felt like I was reaching my breaking point so I listened to the voice. To better myself I decided to give up weed and give it another go. After all, maybe I hate my job because weed makes me an introvert and I’m on virtual meetings pushing through customer calls ALL DAY. 

Tuesday night was my last bowl. Gave my weed to my girlfriend and asked her to hide it. Wednesday - groggy as shit as expected, anxious, depressed. 
But today was something else. 

At 10am (after my 2nd call of the day at that point) I was rushed with uncontrollable feelings that I’ve never experienced before. Decided to take a walk. The whole walk felt that knot in my throat indicating I was about to cry. Thoughts flying through my head - do I quit? How can I let go of this great opportunity? When will the abstinence from weed make me feel good? Damn, a bowl would really solve this rn...

When I got home, Ding - meeting reminder notification!! 

I broke down. 

I messaged the customer and my team said I had an emergency. For the next hour it was uncontrollably crying. I felt how dogs probably feel on the 4th of July. Sensory overload and overwhelming sadness. My girlfriend was incredible and helped me patch myself together, to smile through the pain for my next call :)

I was smoking about 3/4 joints a day without even blinking an eye. On my 22nd birthday I realised I was in a toxic relationship and I decided to stop. 

Here’s the thing and please tell me if you have experienced a similar thing. Every time I have tried to stop my addiction voice gets unbelievably strong. The one that tells you to ‘chill out you’re being dramatic’ or ‘okay but let’s just have one more bag’. I felt less in control than I did when I was trying to stop.

It’s like there was a desperate goblin in my head who turned everything up from a 6 to a 10. I would smoke more weed than I had ever done each time I considered stopping - as if I were rebelling against myself? 

Addiction is weird man. Stay strong. I’m 4 days clean and really really tired of the whole cycle so hopefully I’m done this time.

""Show me all the places you hung out,"" he said.

Well I could show him a park...where I smoked a lot. Or another park...where I smoked a lot. Or the parking lot where I ate McDonald's by myself...after I got stoned. Or the apartment where I hung out with a older drug dealer all day to smoke for free (even though I was sexually harassed by his friends constantly).

Looking back, my life completely vanished once I turned 16. Everything and anything involved smoking weed, getting weed, and dealing with the high.

Before then, I was a starting varsity lacrosse player, with good grades and genuine friendships. That all vanished once I started smoking. Now I'm 24, the same stoner as before, with nothing interesting to share. Weed makes you boring and dull.

I run my own business - but I am a team of one. The voice saying “you have to smoke or you won’t succeed” is strong and loud.

I'm getting 8 hours of sleep a night. I'm working out daily. I'm so much more connected to my family and friends.

2020-07-09 17:55:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hoc8wx/1_week_sober_ive_realized_many_things/,1 week sober. I’ve realized many things.,"First off I just want to say thank you to the amazing supportive people on this subreddit. You’re all so strong and wholehearted and I wish you all well on your own journeys of sobriety. 💕

I’ve (22F) been sober for one week now. I recently posted here on Day 4 about how lost I felt without my “escape” and now I’ve learned what I’ve been escaping from, and it’s so painful. I’ve realized how unhappy I am in my long term relationship, how much I’ve limited myself by ignoring those feelings for years and years, escaping them by vaping them away and pretending that I’m fine with pretending. It’s hard because I love this person from the bottom of my heart and soul. He’s genuine, kind, comforting, logical and caring. But our views of our future are completely different. And I’ve realized I’ve been changing myself, changing my goals, changing who I am, just to make him happy. Just to get his validation.  Just to make sure our relationship doesn’t have any issues. But there’s always been issues. I’ve just been ignoring them. And it’s so fucking painful to get this realization and not be able to go back to the comfort of marijuana to ease the pain. But instead of relapsing, I went to my mom for advice, who told me that my wants and needs are just as important as his, and that I shouldn’t have to mold myself into someone I’m not just to stay with him. And I’m not saying he’s trying to change me, he doesn’t hurt me (intentionally), he loves who I am, but it always feels like I’m not enough when I’m with him. Like he wants something different. And he shows it in the little things he says and does, all the suggestions he gives me. I realized how trapped I feel living her with him  and his family (who talk behind our backs about how we don’t work nearly as hard as them, and he backs them up and tells me we need to do better, making me feel even worse about myself because I’m trying my best every single fucking day and it’s still not enough). I always feel bad about making compromises. Like I’m being selfish. Like when I wanted a lock on our bedroom  to have more privacy (I’m introverted with anxiety and depression so my privacy is extremely important to me), I get ridiculed because it’s a “lock free household and no secrets” kind of thing. There’s hundreds of situations like that that made me feel like.. my feelings don’t matter. That I was being selfish. But talking to my mom coupled with my sober thoughts helped me realize that my feelings, wants and needs are just as important as his, and I need to talk to him and make changes to take the next step towards living the life I truly want to live. It’s so hard facing the truth. But I also know to will be worth it in the end. Sorry for going on a tangent, I know this isn’t a relationship advice subreddit but I do know that many of you going sober may have hidden feelings coming up as well, and hearing similar experiences can make anyone feel less alone. Thank  you for reading if you did. Sending lots of luck and light on your own journeys 💕",10
2020-07-09 17:52:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hoc71z/music/,Music,"When I first listened to KOD by J. Cole, I didn’t really relate to the music. I still enjoyed the album because I think the production goes hard. But here’s why I’m bringing it up now, to quote the first track “life can bring much pain, there are many ways to deal with this pain, choose wisely”. Hearing that today hit differently now that I’m dealing with this addiction. It reminded me that I have a lot of emotional issues that I’m dealing with which led me to smoking more. Instead of processing the pain naturally, I numbed my mind to it. His verse at the of the track “FRIENDS” really hit home for me. I’ll post the lyrics here but if you’re into the rap genre and you haven’t heard the song in awhile, I would recommend giving it a listen again. It’s helped me get through today and oddly enough, given me some hope that I can continue to get past this. I’ll probably try and practice meditating too.


“You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take n——s off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate”",4

My life continously lands me in postions where I cant afford this habit or life twists to a point where my luck runs out and I have no resources. Because i have such a love for this substance I will literally find ways in these situations to smoke just to flip the bird to fate and say you won't force me to quit only I will on my own. I feel like I'm saying fuck you God I'm smoking whether you want me to or not and ill make sure you won't control that. And then I find myself realizing days later I should have quit. Its funny.

One week ago, *something* clicked. I realized weed wasn't serving me any more, so it is time to let go. I gradually consumed the rest of my supply to taper off over about 7 days. So I'm officially 24 hours in, but I am **so excited** that I couldn't wait to share with you all.

I would smoke first thing in the morning, all throughout the day, and right before I went to bed, every day. I finally gave myself a hard wake-up after forcing myself to sit down and think about the time I've lost, the money I've lost, and the opportunities I've lost from my using- I had been trying to push myself before but when I really understood how much I gave up for an addiction that I objectively didn't like that much, I finally stopped NEEDING to get myself to quit, and just started.

  It's day 3 for me. This morning is so hard. I know smoking has numbed all my dreams for years, and some people look forward to having their dreams back, but as someone who always has had incredibly intense nightmares related to PTSD, depression, I have not been looking forward to getting these dreams back. And last night was my first awful one. I can't even remember all the details but it was definitely a dream that felt like it lasted forever and I can't shake it since waking up. You know the ones where you wake up and the dream still feels like reality? In it I was waitress-ing at a cafe I used to work at and getting yelled at by everyone, somehow climbing mount everest with my friends and then getting dizzy and falling off at the top, at my childhood home watching my grandmother slowly die, seeing my ex fling who I haven''t seen in years yelling at me for terminating my pregnancy that has haunted my life ever since and having him degrade me and telling me it is our fault that my baby died even though he was a deadbeat and forced me into the choice, etc... There was more to it but overall just a horrible horrible night of dreaming and I haven't been able to shake it. Plus I woke up to my boyfriend who has been beyond stressed out about work/life/our dog for days in a terrible mood and I am so worried about him and as a very empathetic person I take on all his emotions and it's all just too much... I have been crying all morning and just want to smoke so bad to numb this pain and get out of this funk even though I know it will just make me feel worse and make things suck more in the long run. I have a mental tool box of things to distract me such as yoga, meditating, reading, and more but honestly right now I just don't have the strength to practice any of them. But I am trying to stay strong and maintain day 3 through this. Any kind words or distractions, or encouragement to keep pushing forward would be so much appreciated.

Lots of feelings have been coming up, ones that I must've been burying under my use for years and years - I've done plenty of crying, plenty of being moody and miserable, but hey, that stuff will pass, and I think I'd rather my emotions be a little bit out of control than the only way to get them under control to be smoking a spliff.

In short, it feels great, people have generally been insanely supportive and I'm finally feeling like I'm beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. This community has been a huge help, and you guys are awesome.

Big love, Kx",5

I've learned melodies of a few songs, can play a little with two hands, and when I get home from work I'm so excited to sit down, practise my scales and try new songs, and I play for hours. 

Yesterday afternoon I couldn't focus, was so irrationally frustrated and irritable...so I caved. I literally had about 4 flakes in a tiny rollie, so a tiny microdose. And it turned my brain and body into absolute jelly. I couldn't remember anything I had learnt, couldn't focus, trying to play anything new was out of the question, all my scales and practise was messed up. Just constantly playing the wrong notes, and if I did get it right it sounded off key and out of tune which was strange. All I wanted to do was melt into my chair and pick up my phone, and it also gave me a stinking headache for the rest of the day. It made me realise what its doing to my brain, and no matter how little I have, the cloudy fog of headache and dumb brain that gets pulled over my eyes is the same every time. 

Oh well. Today is a new day and I'm going to learn Minecraft music once my headache clears. Good luck to you all and don't make the mistake I did! It's not worth it.",6

I find myself sleeping in until noon and not getting into work on time, even though I don't have a commute anymore. I can't focus on anything, my mind feels hazy, I feel like I can't keep a coherent thought without my mind drifting somewhere and day dreaming.

I've become anti social and I'm not talking to my friends anymore and I just don't feel like myself. My anxiety is absolutely through the roof and I'm so scared about everything. I just don't know what to do. I know progress isn't linear and some days are definitely worse than others, but I feel like as of a week ago I've plateaued. I stopped exercising, I'm gaining weight.

I first started smoking daily in August of 2019. At first, I really was in love with weed and I was always feeling great when I smoked. It was fun, enjoyable, I could sleep easily, it made things more beautiful, I had wonderful effects of euphoria. 

Then one night, I greened out for the first time. I was having a panic attack. I could taste metal, my throat felt like it was closing, my heart was racing, I was scared and a little paranoid. After that experience I couldn’t quite get back to the lovely and wonderful effects I had experienced before. Something just wasn’t the same. But I continued to smoke- I was smoking two bowls a night. The first one typically I would burn at 9pm, and the next around 2am. I would continue this cycle. Sometimes I’d wake up high. I had to be high to go to church. I would even smoke before work sometimes. 
It became a habit for me- and I continued this way until about an entire year had gone by. Near the end, I would end up smoking so much every high was bad. I would end up extremely paranoid and nauseous. I got so high that I believe I experienced mild psychosis- while they were fast asleep I began hearing the voices of my family screaming, moaning, and crying outside my room, telling me I poisoned them. At one point I was watching myself from outside of my body- I got that high. It was an extremely disturbing and unpleasant experience which to this day I think has spoiled any attempts at smoking to relax or enjoy my time. 

I chose to give up smoking about a month ago. I had quite a binge session during the month of April, to celebrate mostly, and ended up smoking pretty much every night. Again, at first it was nice but ended up quickly being unpleasant for me. 

I kept trying to convince myself I enjoyed it. I support other people’s habits, so why can’t I support myself? Nearly every time I smoked I would get very anxious feelings, but I continued to put myself through it trying so hard to enjoy the product I bought. But it wasn’t really the weed that spoiled my experience- it was just bringing out the demons my mind has been harboring in full force. So I am grateful in that way to have experienced the things I did- but for now I am choosing to let go. 

It’s just not for me and I am finally accepting it. I can find other things to numb myself. I just can’t do weed anymore. I’ll probably give what I have left to a friend. For now, I’ll focus on beginning a new job and saving money.",3

Just spent a while scrolling through all the posts on here and, god, it's good to not be alone. I'm 24 years old and I've been an every day smoker for at least 6 years now. And admitting that it's been 6 whole years blows my mind. I never drank or smoked in high school, so when I started binge drinking and smoking in college my brain justified it as ""I didn't start when I was young so I can indulge now"". Well I guess that mindset stuck for way longer than I'd hoped.

I've seen some people list why they want to stop, and they revisit them to remind themselves so I'll do the same, and if you can relate to these please comment! It's a huge help to not be alone:

\-I just want my memory back. I've become the butt of my friends jokes because they know I have a terrible memory. It's even gotten to the point where once I looked at a friend and said ""We weren't close in college right?"" and she looked shocked and said she considered us very close. Then proceeded to list memories of things we did together that I had totally forgotten. I've lived a beautiful and privileged life so far, I really don't want to forget it.

\-Getting my eating habits under control. After years of using regular smoking as an appetite suppressant (when I'm not high) then binging after not eating all day (after smoking), I've had to finally slap the big fun words ""Eating Disorder"" on my cosmic resume. 

\-I was reading Bell Hooks' book ""All About Love"" and she writes ""Addiction does not leave room for love"". It's true. I value my spirituality and emotional intelligence over all things. But that shit goes out the window when I smoke. I will happily leave family gatherings early just to smoke. Friends will try to confide in me while I'm high and I feel like theres a wall in between me and my ability to connect with them emotionally. Worst of all I get into total junkie mode when I need to get high. I have screamed at friends I've asked to hide my weed from me, because they won't give it back to me. I will steal my roommates bud late at night just because I'm out and refuse to buy more because I'm ""quitting"". 

\-Anxiety. I suffer from such intense anxiety (fast pulse, can't catch a breath, general panic, so restless) when I get the idea of smoking in my head but don't have any on hand. I don't know if I have an anxiety disorder I need diagnosed or if I would feel from relief from quitting. Never quit long enough to try.

The thing that keeps bringing me back is that weed has been very good to me in so many other ways. I have laughed so hard I've cried. It was my gateway to being a more social person, sitting in the stoner circle and passing a bong. I'm an artist and the rush of creativity you get at the beginning of a high is so amazing. But this fun is undermined by the fact that I can't stop. I wish I was someone who could do it casually. 

Anyway this is such a long post, I feel like I really just needed to vent it out. I know lots of people mention the fact that their conscious brain can know that they want to start a different life, that they know they can't be ""casual"" smokers like other people, yet there is this unconscious thing that just pushes you to smoke, its like a reflex.  And I'm in that boat totally. Anyway, cheers to another Day 1. I'm going to keep posting and commenting and interacting in this subreddit to hopefully keep me on track.

\--

5 minutes ago, I literally ran outside and threw everything into the trash bin. I couldn't risk throwing it into the bin in my room because I **refuse** to even contemplate the shame of digging for it later.

I have been a lurker for several months. I wasn't going to post this but then I thought of how motivating it was to see the determination displayed here and changed my mind. This subreddit is the *only* reason I was able to catch my addiction early.

Unlike most who seem to have been dependent for many, many years, I was only introduced to marijuana 3 years ago and started smoking daily just over 1 year ago. This played a part in my cockiness. I had millions of excuses as to why it wasn't an issue. After all, I worked 3 jobs, was in an accelerated honors program, and had just opened my own store. Clearly I was in control. It was the typical trope of *""I'm not addicted - I can quit anytime""*. In reality, it had stopped being about my anxiety and depression ages ago.

What I wouldn't admit to myself was how I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was manageable before COVID-19 hit; I was engaged by school and work and told myself I was in control because I only allowed myself to smoke it at the end of the day after all my work was complete. I justified that my tolerance never increased and there are plenty who are comparatively worse off (which is a fucked up way to rationalize considering I was comparing myself with people with massive dependency).

When COVID-19 happened, I started taking hits every 3 hours. My boyfriend has a strong dislike of weed because he had wasted away several years of his high school life to it. He knew I smoked but I never did it in his presence. Thinking about the way I always feigned an excuse to hop up into my room to blow the smoke out my bathroom window with the exhaust fan on and Febreze afterwards is making me feel shame all over again. He definitely knew.

All I'm saying is that there are doubtlessly many of you just like me; you're high-functioning, you're relatively active, and you don't display the typical severity of dependence. I'd advise you to tread carefully because that's how I fell into the hole of literally doing *nothing* for the past 4 months. 

At the end of the day, I know my journey will be less arduous than those who have been dependent for 10+ years and I am thankful for it. I'm thankful for each and every one of you that has posted about your struggles and how incredibly supportive this community is. It's thanks to you guys that I didn't go even deeper down that path. I am immensely proud of all your efforts and I'm proud of myself too.",23

This is my first post on this sub and i wanted to shout everyone out for the impeccable community you've all created. The vulnerability is heartfelt hence why i also wanted to share my journey: 

I've been a chronic smoker for over 10 years. Picked it up as a 17 year old college freshman, here i am 11 years later (28 currently) somehow now deciding enough is enough. Someone asked me why? 

\- Honestly i would like to think that most of us consciously know certain habits aren't good for us. At least that's how i felt about weed, like i know this isn't good for me but we find our rationalizations and trudge forward only to feel like shit about it the next day. Yet even that wasn't enough, as i often found myself running to the next blunt or chance at getting high (""you're already feeling shitty, might as well smoke it off, try again tomorrow - said my mind). 11 years later.....clearly this works 

\- Yet despite the conscious chatter that tells us to stop, it was only when i listened to my heart/soul that i knew this wasn't right for me. I've always been into spirituality and meditations, yet the latter is saving my life. Listen to your intuition, not the chatter in the head, but the spot in your chest that hurts when you laugh or cry. Listen - the answers are there.

&#x200B;

Day 1 - Withdrawal is very real. I've been nursing mental fatigue and slight irritability all day but i've done a great job at keeping this in check around my family. What sucks is i have no one around me that understands the struggle so i felt as if i were suffering in silence today. This community keeps me going! I wrote this with hopes to add to the volume of struggles and successes on this amazing sub but also as a way to hold myself accountable.

I will report on day 5 (Sunday) with new updates!

First of all: it’s great to be hear and I’m very thankful that I found this sub. 
I tried to quit smoking weed several times but it never lasted more than 3 days. 
Right now, it’s even hard for me to resist half a day and I’m feeling worse and worse everyday. 
I know that I am capable of way more than what I am doing right now with my life, but the fast satisfaction always wins against my willpower, so I get frustrated. And the cycle continues almost everyday, I can literally see myself wasting energy and time, not only on smoking but also on those arguments with myself. 
I just smoked my last one and I won’t write my plug tomorrow. It will be pretty hard but I have to do it.

Have a good one :)

I only quit two months ago, and am already forgetting why, so figured I better write this down and have it handy to pull up at any time. And may as well share it for some extra accountability! Please share your reasons too, you may mention something that resonates with me even though I didn't list it here, giving me more ammo to stay away from weed.

Here are the reasons why I quit:

- I wanted to be free from its clutches. I was sick of relying on it to function/feel normal

- I wanted my moods to be more stable. I was sick of the up and down of my moods, only feeling happy/content when I was stoned. Roller coaster of moods as I would come down from the high, then get high again, and repeat

- I wanted to be free to plan and take trips without obsessing over weed. I hated how I couldn't take a vacation without stressing over how I was going to get some, and constantly thinking about it until I was able to get some. Revolving my trip plans around where I'd be able to get weed, avoiding travel to places where weed isn't easy to get

- I wanted to live a long healthy life, free of lung issues. I was scared for my lung health and afraid of developing lung cancer. My lungs have taken a beating since I was 13 years old, and deserve to breathe air instead of smoke all the time

- I wanted to feel full of energy and young. I was always burnt out and tired, I couldn't make it through a movie or TV show without falling asleep

- I wanted to feel healthy. I was sick of going to bed stuffed full of chips and cookies 

- I wanted to be able to cherish my memories. Life goes fast and I am afraid to forget my greatest moments. I hated how I could never remember anything

- I wanted to be of sound mind for the rest of my life. I was scared for my mental health long term - I am afraid to be a vegetable when I'm older, or even worse become a schizophrenic",34

I only drink once a week, and when I was tipsy I asked my friend for a joint. My logic was that it has been long enough, maybe i wouldn't crave for it after that one joint. And fair enough my friend gave me a joint to bring back home. 

Still thanking myself that I decided to check on this forum for relapse stories. In a tipsy state, I just stared at the joint for what felt like half an hour once I was in my room. Checked back on my quit weed app, reasons to quit and asked myself if its really worth sacrificing all those just for a moment of pleasure. 

Finally said, ""nahh bitch, not today!"" to the joint and left it there. I know 'just once' will become 'just on the weekend' and finally 'just one at night'. Been through this slippery slope numerous times.

In the end writing all my feelings before, during, and after smoking  or eating a gummy was the ticket.  The details.  When I read it back it is just pitiful being controlled by an expensive plant.

Today marks my 10th day sober, and I'm looking to just vent some things. 

I've been feeling pretty lost these past few years and not feeling like my life has direction. Weed was my vice to not think about these feelings. Quarantine forced the realization on me that these feelings will only get worse, and smoking everyday wasn't helping. I got to the point of needing to get high, and then immediately regretting it as soon as I was. I felt a lot of self loathing towards my apathy and was scared cause I didn't feel the strength to take control of my life.

What helped me address these feelings was working up the courage to start talking to a counselor (around the end of May). I'm using a phone app for this service and the only reason I'm mentioning that is because seeking an actual in person therapist/counselor has always felt like a turn off to me for some reason. Some may disagree with this, but so far I have found this service to be very helpful to my needs. 10 days ago I flushed my weed down the toilet - talking to a counselor definitely gave me more strength to make that change. I'm not saying everyone needs a counselor, but if anything I am saying is ringing true with you, I encourage you to take a chance and find one to talk to :) 

I'm feeling a little lost and sad these past 10 days sober, but I know and am hopeful my mood will improve given a little time. I'm grateful to have this subreddit to vent on, just knowing that at least one person with similar feelings may see this brings me comfort. 

For you LotR fans out there, I'm finally reading the books for the first time and a quote from Gimli has stuck with me during this time: 

""Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens""

Stay well my friends! We are strongest together, but never doubt your own strength, even if you feel hopelessly lost as I did. Change is possible!",9

I'm at a point where I sort of wish I had never smoked weed ever and I really do want to quit. But when I do start to quit, the first day is always great but then the second day comes around and I quickly start craving it again. I start to become depressed or agitated way more quickly to the point where my cravings start to consume me and it's all I want to do. I know I'm addicted but I really do want to quit. It sucks even more because I'm a small-amount buyer (I typically buy in grams because I'm a lightweight and typically only smoke at night) and the area I'm currently living in I'm told is near impossible to buy anything under an 8th. Perhaps that's a sign to really stop smoking, but instead it pisses me off that I'd have to shell out $60 for weed that would last me months.

I was going to wait for 60 days to celebrate but 50 is just as special.  The night before I was ready to quit, I was using it to cope with the most depressing thoughts I had ever had. I was alone, dishonest with myself and others, and unbelievably down. It was my rock botton.  It was scary. 

Today I can tell you how good it feels not to smoke. I am walking over 10,000 steps a day, I changed my diet, I am seeing a counsellor, my relationships are feeling so good and different. I can sit and watch a full movie. I am being honest with myself and those around me. 

I don't miss rolling 8 joints at a time just to chain smoke them after work. I don't miss the fog and the paranoia. I don't miss not remembering what happened the day before. I don't miss it being the only thing I could do with my friends. I have not felt this good in over 10 years. I have found that life is more creative and beautiful without it.

Yes, I still get sad but I have learned to actually cope with my feelings and be mindful of what I am feeling whereas before I only bothered to get stoned to blanket everything. 

Yeah, it is only 50 days but I'm so fucking proud of myself. I cannot thank this group enough. Be proud of yourself no matter if it is your day 1, day 4, day 8 or day 100.

I have an amazing partner, great family members who I are also my friends, and I'm not going to relapse - I am happy and at peace with my decision to change and do something that was good for me - but I get sad and get it into my head that most of my other relationships weren't as substantial as I thought they were, and I start thinking negatively, like ""people didn't like me, they just liked the atmosphere I brought when I was smoking or drinking"". etc etc.

Sure, the first few weeks are extremely noticeable in the way the body and mind feel without cannabis. These positive experiences can sometimes assist with reinforcing the decision to stay off the drug. I picture each day without weed is like making an imaginary deposit into my emotional bank, of which daily weed leaves us all In the red, constantly withdrawing more and more from less and less

The first week off of weed, pretend this is like putting $70 into this “emotional bank account” ($10 a day)

Where it gets tough, and the point of this post, is when the gains are not nearly as noticeable. One month weed free, the emotional deposits may be a lot less, and again much less for two months weed free.

Here’s where we as addicts sometimes falter. 

“Oh, what’s one joint? I’ll still maintain my mental sharpness if I only smoke one”

We are withdrawing from a rather large sum so it may not be noticeable.

But remember that’s how corporations drain our bank accounts, $5 at a time. The idea is to keep depositing. Even if it’s only $1 a day, we are always improving. The line will curve up. Stay on this path. Never let yourself be fooled by the damage of tiny withdrawals from our emotional bank.",9

Over the last 15 years, I got my degree, began working in tech and now have a senior level position at a digital product company. I got married 7 years ago and we had our first child last year. We moved from the Midwest to a legal state out west. I gave up cigarettes a few years ago and I gave up drinking 6 months ago.

However, I’ve become incredibly isolated and talk to my friends and family on the phone very rarely. I struggle to actually contribute at my job, despite my position and experience I’ve built over the last several years. My ability to communicate and focus has degraded to the point of needing addressed. I want to be present for my new son. I want to do better as a father, husband, son, brother, and friend. 

I’m terrified to not have a crutch. I’ve been so reliant on weed that I can’t imagine how I would deal with stress, pain from my arthritis, and general depression without it. I’ve talked with a therapist in the last but never found it particularly helpful. Very few people know that I’m a stoner. I feel like I’m lying to everyone. I feel like a fraud.

I guess I’m just having trouble getting over the hump and committing. I’ve basically consumed every day in the last 10 years. It’s like an old friend.

(backstory = 15 year daily/hourly user) I decided last night not to spark up that next J. I did not smoke this morning. I will not smoke tonight.

The need to quit finally hit me when someone asked me ""what makes you happy?"" Mind you that question was asked of me about 2 years ago. I don't know what makes me happy. What is happy? Why don't I understand what makes me happy? Do I even experience emotions? I know I get annoyed/upset sometimes. Sometimes I feel thankful. I sometimes feel appreciated.

Another big reason I need to quit... I have a good position at my workplace that I do not care for. I am invested enough(20 years) into the company that when I made my boss aware I wasn't enjoying my work they have asked me what I would like to do going forward. I don't know. I have always just done what was needed of me. I just know that I do not like this. But is it the career I don't like? Or is it the fact that I can never come to a confident conclusion? I am told that I am doing a good job but I do not ever feel that is the case. I suspect my lack of confidence is associated with my regular smoking.

Another reason: I cannot take a compliment. I have made strides in my personal health over the last year I often get feedback from folks on my improvements. I can never take these comments seriously. I always have to laugh them off or diminish them. Why can't I love myself?

I dread pushing away some of my oldest friends. My free time generally revolves around spending time with my buds. I am scared I won't be able to sleep. I am proud of my glass collection and I need to get rid of it, though it will be hard to let go due to all the memories and not to mention $$$. I am afraid of not being comfortable, afraid of not being content with my existence as a whole. Smoking is such a large part of my identity I am afraid to remove it.

I'm two days sober and just at the start of my journey. Here's my story:

I had never really started smoking weed until. 24 and even then it was once every few months when a friend had it. Last fall it became legal in Canada and I realized that indica was somewhat of a wonderdrug for me. While sativa was horrible (paranoia, anxiety). In fact indica was so good at reducing anxiety and letting me chill out that I started smoking 2-4 times a week. Within a month it was everyday. It's been 8 solid months of smoking everyday and I've stated to think about doing it during the day now that I work at home - luckily I haven't done this yet and it's what triggered me to think I might have a problem 

So I've decided to quit, the problem for my are the side effects of quitting. I cannot fall asleep till at least 1 or 2 when I usually go to bed at 10. When I do fall asleep I have terrible nightmares and anxiety dreams.

I can feel so hopeless some nights I just want some weed oil to fall asleep. Anyone else experienced this? How long did it last? Any alternatives you used that worked for you?",3

Overall was a super good experience, all around good vibes. so far this time i'm off to a great start! Im not even feeling any withdrawal symptoms I had last time I stopped, my sleep isn't the best but i'm still able to grab  6-7 hours, which is alot better than nothing! 

On a side note, it's been 2-3 days and I still haven't had any dreams, any idea when that'll come back?",1

I’d describe myself, probably along with many others, as having been a “functional” stoner. Graduated early with several internships and decent grades. Been employed and doing pretty well at work since I left college. Fairly regular exercise routine and social life etc. 

All this is pretty good for a daily user, yeah? I used to pride myself on being a functional stoner. But the other day, I just thought...Is that really all I aspire to, all I want to be in this life? “Functional”? Why not: successful, accomplished, passionate, loving, driven, excited, vibrant, etc? Why just stop at getting by or doing “pretty well” all things considered?

If this is how I’ve managed with daily weed use, I can only imagine where I’d be without it. but it’s never too late, so here’s to a fresh start.",538

I've been smoking bongs each day for the past 5 years, and recently (and a number of times before) I've been hoping that I'll slow it down or stop soon. I find it hard to instigate this as its really ingrained in my habits (family smoke too).

I used to exercise, meditate, play saxophone, see friends, and read all the time. Not so much anymore. I'm in uni currently, and all I feel like I do, especially in lockdown (pandemic) is smoke and study, especially with work shut. I feel as though if I had a proper schedule, and maybe incorporated those old activities back into my life, I would have less free time to smoke, and maybe I can nudge out my smoking from there. 

I was wondering if anyone had any good resources (videos, books, articles, apps) that helped them build and follow healthy schedules and habits. Any advice appreciated :)",1

2020-07-07 04:15:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hmqizh/day_15_insomnia_finally_gone_extreme_fatigue/,"Day 15 - Insomnia Finally Gone, Extreme Fatigue Kicking In","Day 15 - The first 13 nights were haunted by terrible insomnia and very vivid dreams. For 2 nights now I have been sleeping like a rock and the vividness of dreams is subsiding, although they are still very much present. I have always remembered my dreams in great detail though, so it seems like it's returning to normal. I don't wake up all night thinking ""what the fuck just happened?"" anymore, as was the case in the first 13 nights. Dreams are nice again.

However, my insomnia has been replaced by quite the opposite problem: extreme fatigue. In the last 2 nights, I have had a solid 8 to 9 hours of sleep (which is a ton compared to the nights before). Never the less, I feel many times more fatigued than I was when I was getting only 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night. Especially mentally it feels like I'm totally drained and I feel like I can sleep for days. On one side it's super nice that I can finally sleep soundly without weed for the first time in many months, on the other side it's definitely not cool to feel like the human equivalent of a Snorlax.

I can already feel comments coming in about becoming active to feel active so quick side note: I exercise intensely for 5 to 6 days a week and my nutrition is super healthy. The only reason I smoked weed every night in the first place was to treat my insomnia so I could keep my exercise regime going. Even though I'm still exercising, I'm noticing that this too is extremely difficult at the moment. I had no problems keeping this up when I was sleep-deprived or when I was smoking weed every night.

I don't have an explanation for why this is happening but my best guess is that my body is getting readjusted to getting proper sleep the natural way and for some reason, this is causing extreme fatigue. If any of you do have an explanation for this I'd be happy to hear it. For now, I'll just take it as a blessing that I can finally sleep again and I'll just see when it goes away. Definitely not going to cave in anytime soon.",4

Its just been a long, long time since I've been proud of myself.

I have been smoking weed almost everyday for 2 years now. Despite this, I considered myself a ""functional stoner"" -- I was a straight A student while maintaining a part-time job. But COVID really messed things up for me.

The past months have been a haze. I basically smoked 2g+ a day, everyday since May. It was getting out of hand. Sure, I was maintaining rent and bill payments, but the amount of money and time I was spending on weed was just unacceptable. So, earlier this week I decided I was not going to buy more weed; but, instead, I was going to quit.

I'm 6 days and counting. I feel more anxious and depressed than usual, but otherwise I haven't had cravings.

To all of those who don't think they can do it. You can. Don't let your dreams be dreams. Things are much clearer on this side of the fence.

I just keep telling myself this: ""as long as I am a better person than I was yesterday, then I'm moving in the right direction.

2020-07-07 02:31:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hmpbco/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,I need to get this off my chest,"I want to quit. I was one of the smartest kids in school and now I am stagnating because of weed. I can't concentrate on anything when I'm high, and when I'm not high I just want to be high. When I'm high I get that fog-brain and I'm incredibly slow at my work but when I'm sober I can't pay attention to anything for more than 5 minutes before wanting to drop it cause I'm missing that dopamine kick. I've always been a little lazy but never like this before weed. Some of that is cyclical--I was struggling in my career so I started smoking weed more, then smoking more weed made it even harder to get ahead in my career.

My lungs fucking hurt. Like all the time. I'm constantly paranoid that I'm just dying and I don't know. I've gained so much weight. I was fat before weed but not like this. I've spent so much money on weed. Like so, so much money. And like, ok, if I didn't spend it on weed I probably would have spent it on alcohol or video games or whatever other bullshit. But not all of it, not as much as I spend on it. I could have saved so much money. So many times I was worried about paying the bills meanwhile I'm forking over bill money for green.

I've stopped talking to all my family. I have no friends from before weed, partly because of my own withdrawing, partly because I used to be a lot more socially awkward. Weed helped me get out of my shell and actually make friends. I'm afraid of being the lame, dorky person I was before. I don't want to lose my friends. They're great people none of them would pressure me. We even have a sober friend who hangs with us all the time. But I don't think I can be around it and they won't want to hang out sober.  I enjoy things more on it. Movies, video games, sex. I don't want to go back to doing those sober. I barely want to do them at all when I'm sober. I want to quit sinking all my time into pointless bullshit but it just feels like an insurmountable peak to climb. I can make changes in my life for a week but they never stick. I'm sick of feeling like I'm wasting my life.

Most problematic of all is my relationship. I've invested so much time into this relationship, and I do love him still. But I know he's bad for me. When I talk about being afraid for my health he brushes me off because he doesn't want to quit. I don't think he'll ever quit and honestly I don't think I would like him if he did. He's an asshole when he's not high and I was close to leaving him before we started smoking together. It saved our relationship. It got us both to bring down our defenses and just be honest with each other about what we want in the relationship and to listen to each other instead of just dismissing each other's concerns for our own selfishness. He's kinder, more caring, more loving, and a better communicator. I know what he's learned won't go away but he has a bad temper when he's not high. I used to walk on eggshells and I still do when we run out--which is rarer since he stopped being unemployed, but I'm the only reason he found a job. He literally could not get himself a job for years and I am afraid of what happens if he loses this one for whatever reason (not likely, but always a concern in the back of my mind). 

Even if I asked him to quit he wouldn't. He would choose weed over me. And I keep repeatedly choosing him over my own health and longevity. He would probably be ok with me quitting, but he wouldn't understand it and would probably pressure me--I can hear him now ""just smoke one bowl with me."" I'm thinking about stealthily just trying to quit, just to see if I can. But then even if that did happen, I'd still have to keep buying it for him. Basically his whole paycheck would keep going to weed and I'd be the one supporting us again only this time I wouldn't even have the luxury of getting high. We would fight about money all the time, and I would grow to resent him more than I already do. 

I know this is toxic but I don't want to leave him. I realize I probably should but I'm so afraid of being alone. I have no one now except for him and my stoner friends. And I love him. Our relationship is complicated in a lot of other ways and I know I haven't laid out a pretty picture but he is very, very there for me emotionally about everything but this. He helped me through so many dark times and no one understands me like him. And when we're smoking and hanging out together, it's my favorite thing and I just don't really like other people except for him. I don't want to lose the closeness we have but if I quit weed that's what I'd be doing.

Sorry I know this is a long rant. Advice welcome, but I'm pretty sure you're all going to tell me to quit weed and possibly (probably?) tell me to leave him. And I'm not really sure if I can. Even if I can get myself past all of the emotional hurdles then there's the financial barrier of being on my own. Of course I'll save money on bud (if I can even manage to quit), but I know I'll end up depleting my savings account separating from him. I don't have much and I don't want to have to give him half just for him to blow it on weed (my money, from inheritance--I don't have much left cause we blew it all on weed). And I don't think he can support himself alone, especially since he'll still be buying weed. I'm afraid he'll kill himself. He hasn't threatened to and he doesn't hold it over me or anything like that. It's just that we're both really depressed people and if he doesn't have me and he can't support himself I don't think he'll last very long. If I leave him it will completely blind side him. He has no idea I feel this way.

I don't want to waste my life anymore but I don't want to stop either. I want to live 2 lives, one as a druggie burnout that dies a 35 year old nobody of alcohol poisoning and one where I get my fucking shit together. I want to watch them both play out and pick which one is better. I'm afraid to change because I'm afraid it won't be worth it or it will even be worse than now and then I won't even have weed or my partner to help me cope with it.",7

Another reason is that I have absolutely no one else to talk to this about. I'm 18 (M) years old, and just graduated high school. I've been smoking for 2 years, it got a lot worse for me, really fast. This might be a long post. No shame in here.

When I started, I would smoke only on the weekends, at night. I was strict about it, and I felt responsible, and in control. Soon, though, I started finding myself waiting through the school week, wishing the weekend could arrive sooner, just so I could smoke. I went online to try and figure out if I should be concerned, and I was met with endless optimism about weed. People said you couldn't get addicted, people said there were no negative effects, people said ""you can stop whenever you want"", and I happily believed it, thinking cannabis was the wonder drug. I started allowing myself cheat days where I would smoke on one weeknight, and then it became 2 week nights. Pretty soon I was smoking every night. I loved how relaxed/calm/stress free and even creative it made me. It concerned me very little, because I had plenty of friends who smoked every day, and plenty of seemingly healthy people online telling me they smoked every day. I still wasn't smoking during the day, just at night. I was busy/distracted with homework, going out with friends, senior parties, etc. This went on for about half the year without getting much worse. But then, Covid happened. All my classes went online. After just a few days of quarantine, I was smoking like I never had before. Every single day, starting the minute my online classes finished. Then, I started skipping the classes. ""They didn't matter"", I told myself. I forgot that I used to be a person who loved learning. Things just kept getting worse. I was working, so I had money to spend. I bought $100 worth of weed would finish it in 2 weeks. I started waking up around noon, and smoked until I slept around 2-3am. My parents didn't and still don't know a thing, even though I didn't leave my room for 99% of the day. They asked if I was okay, and I said yes and made up countless excuses. My friends knew I smoked occasionally, but they had no idea the extent. My tolerance went from 0 to 100. I tried to quit a few times, mostly when I ran out of weed, but a few days later I would give in to my own impulsivity and buy more.

After a few months of this nonsense, I (luckily) came to my senses. My memory was shit, there was so much fog in my head that I couldn't remember what I did the day before. I used to spend hours on hobbies, working out, and chatting with friends. I found myself doing none of them anymore, and not even caring that I had stopped. 7 days ago, I quit, and I hope I can keep it up. It's been hard as fuck. I didn't sleep the first night, and every night since has been terrible. For some reason, and I have no idea why, I feel mostly fine during the day. But then, in the evening at around 6-8, it hits me like a bus. Depression, anxiety, no appetite, severe intrusive thoughts, I can't even get out of bed. I feel like a piece of shit, for so many reasons. I feel like I've let down myself, and my family. I'm moving out in a month, and I've wasted most of the last precious few months I could have been spending with my loving family, shut in my room high. I feel guilty beyond words, and at times have even considered suicide (although all thoughts of death are immediately stopped by the amount of sadness it would cause my family). My chest is tight while writing this, and I've spent the last hour staring at a wall trying to hold back tears. Every night is the same, me staring into space lost in the constantly berating thoughts of self-hate. It feels like my brain isn't even my own anymore.

While it's gotten a bit better since the day I quit, it's still really bad. The day I quit I didn't even get out of bed, told my family and job that I needed a day off. I felt worthless. That day, I found this sub. This is my first post, but reading the stories shared here and the level of support that you all have for each other warms my heart beyond words. I've often found myself getting more and more depressed the further I scroll through Reddit, reading depressing news posts and comments from people who are racist and toxic and everything else. Not in this community, and I'm so grateful for that, and it's also the reason I decided to share my own (ongoing) story. Reading posts and comments on this community has helped me so much during the last week, and most importantly has helped me get over my own delusions that weed is harmless.

I've tried in the past couple days to gather the motivation just to start some of the things that I've heard help with the anxiety and depression, like meditation and journaling, but I've mostly failed. Writing this here has helped, and although I still feel like shit, I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. And I can't thank this wonderful community of amazing and supportive people enough.",26

It’s easy enough to say “no thanks” and I’ve trained myself to be able to stay away from tempting myself to keep my addictive personality at bay, but I want to start on my journey of being fully clean. I’m sick of the brain-fog and anxiety, the spacing out and dense feelings I’m nearly constantly having.

It helped so much with my panic attacks, negative thoughts and anxious feelings, it was like my mind could FINALLY shut up. But I became dependent on it, and I couldn’t even spend half the day without it. I used weed to eat, sleep, relax, cry, meditate, shower, everything. I knew I had to make a change and my husband has also been worrying about my usage. Reading through these gives me inspiration but also makes me extremely depressed. People on here talk about spending time doing more productive things now that they are sober but for me, I had chronic depression and suicidal thoughts before I started smoking weed, so I still don’t have that motivation to fix my life so to say. I’ve tried many antidepressants and non of them have worked. I’ve read scientific studies that prove that the herb saffron is a natural anti depressant so I’m trying that while I’m sober. I don’t go to therapy because I can’t afford it. So weed had always been my go to “medicine” before. It discourages me that quitting this beautiful substance is only the first step towards feeling... normal. And it’s such a hard step. I’ve tried quitting 10+ times by now and I always end up relapsing by the end of the week. I don’t want to lose my escape. I’m worried I won’t be able to deal with these negative thoughts and emotions, and that I might end up hurting myself. But if I continue to smoke weed, I’ll simply be stuck where I am.

However, I miss smoking. I miss being able to do it an appropriate amount. A once every weekend or once every two weekends quick night smoke to help me relax and reflect on where I’m at. So, I’m considering going back to smoking very occasionally after taking a 6 month break. Any advice?

And I know I have to because I've been thinking that for years now. Granted, I've been dealing with other addictions, and the issues that arose from these. I am 110 days off alcohol, 107 off cigarettes, 30 off nicotine vaping. I am an alcoholic. I am 28 years old. I had to leave the woman I was with for 10 years because I couldn't stop drinking. I've been off work since December because of issues arising from my drinking. It still took a few months before I laid off the booze and I finally did. Nicotine was tricky. But, sheeeit, I've been smoking weed since before I drank.

I do not remember the last day I have smoked zero cannabis. Feels like it's been over five years ago. Now, it's been easy for me to justify my weed smokeage. It don't kill my liver or my lungs in the same way as booze or nicotine. I'd much rather smoke a joint than a cigarette or drink. But it's now time to be honest with myself and see what weed has given me.

It's given me a hole I keep going back to. It's my main tool of escape. And I'm no stranger to escaping. Before the drugs, and with the drugs, it was video games. I went to college in a game development program, surrounded by game addicts. Change of career, went into horticulture, and ended up working in a cannabis production facility, growing medicinal and now recreational weed. Fun job, I gotta say, getting blazed every break, work with music. It was fun. But after a few years, man it gets old. And once again, I'm surrounded by addicts (in denial).

I'm just tired of doing nothing. Tired of being tired. Tired of being pacified, reduced into a shell of a person. I want to achieve my true potential. Our time on this lovely, ugly planet is limited. I want to read, I want to write, I want to play music, I want to create, I want to cry and laugh and live life. I have been doing some of these things, which has been great, but I've still been holding myself back.

I've known all this for quite a while, but I haven't acted much on it. With it being recreationally legal here in Canada, I buy it online, it gets dropped off at my door, it's too easy. I've been staying at my parents in the suburbs but went back to my place out in the country for a week. I'm staying with my girlfriend who does not smoke. I did not restock before coming, and I cannot get it delivered here. I'm basically stuck with an emergency 1g which I've already dipped into. Felt nauseous this morning, hungry but not wanting to eat, felt very anxious. I eventually had a few puffs and got more sleep.

I'm kind of worried for these withdrawals because I don't have a substance to replace it this time (except caffeine). I was kind of scoffing at the idea of withdrawals but I'm about to find out how it goes.

I don't know what my point or goal is. I don't know if I want to quit forever. Like I said, I'd rather go to weed than alcohol or nicotine. But I know that I don't need to smoke 5 joints a day. If I go further, I can admit, I don't need one joint a day. I'd rather reach for weed than booze or cigs, but I'd rather not reach for a substance at all. I need to work on this part of myself, to get to the core of who I am. What thoughts, what beliefs, what actions drive me, so I can change them.

Announcing to them, that I'm quit has shown to be anxiety inducing, because I'm scared to fail, but that anxiety also contributes to my general anxiety, which I assume is at least part of the reason I kept doing this for so long. Failing promises so often is crushing and the only person to blame is me.

The three other friends I was toking with were all elder than me and I remember zoning the fuck out as the thc engulfed my brain. The next few months i slowly and steadily started smoking way more and by the time i was 17 I was smoking almost every day.

What sucked is that in this phase, my closest friends were all stoners so my circle and lifestyle revolved around that. We would talk about different strains, laugh and listen to music. My girlfriend at the time was also a heavy smoker and we would meet everyday, smoke, fuck, fight, and then smoke again to calm down. It was a toxic cycle and weed definitely played a part in it. I wont say i regret those days, because I sure did make some amazing memories. But its sad to say that these friends are no longer in my life anymore. All throughout junior and senior year of high school, and my first 2 years of college, i pretty much made friends based on if they smoke or not. and thats so unhealthy, cuz all we did was bond over an external substance. when we met and spent time together, it wasn't because we genuinely enjoyed each other's company, it was because we enjoyed Mary Jane and the conversations that flowed with it.

Also my grades have dropped since i started smoking. During the first 2 years of high school i was literally 2nd in my class and since smoking ive slowly dropped to the lowest 30% of my class. Not just grades, but I haven't really done much in terms of extracurriculars like clubs in college and working out. I'm a skinny 138 pound guy standing at 5'11 and i feel ashamed to look at myself in the mirror. 

I'm now 20 years old and I know I'm still young and i have alot left to do, but i still feel like i spent so much time and money on weed that i could have used for personal development. I have thought about this seriously and have realized this, but i still have some stoner friends and i get tempted to smoke when we meet, Ofcourse lockdown has reduced this alot, but it is still there in the back of my mind. I am currently 2 weeks sober, and before that i've been smoking less frequently like once in 10 days. But its time to let this go forever, It was fun while it lasted, but I'm growing up now and life has so much more to offer.

So as a note to my future self (incase i get tempted) and for anyone else that needs it, this is why I need to stop forever:

* Brain fog that scatters thoughts, goals, and ambitions
* Choosing friends based on who smokes
* Getting lazy due to smoking and lagging on college work and working out
* Zoning out and not being able to socialize with sober people 
* Being in a haze 24/7 with every day being unproductive and just passing by with nothing to show for it
* Stress due to lack of weed, paranoid of getting caught (illegal country), avoiding other tasks to go score
* Being content with sitting around and doing nothing.

Edit:  I had a close call on Day 86 and thought I should share.  I had an argument with my daughter (21) and wife.  My wife and I came in from a day trip and the first thing my daughter when we walked in the door was something like: ""I really like it when you are both gone!""  My wife lashed back saying ""if you don't like us you should move out!""  I was in the familiar role of feeling caught between.  I was upset.  I spoke with my daughter for a bit while my wife was upstairs changing clothes.  I still felt upset but I was rational.  I told her it's ok for her to have thoughts like that but she shouldn't say them to us, because it is hurtful. 

I was feeling pretty low so I went outside and did some yard work and thinking.  Smoking some weed sounded really good.  Instead of smoking I called my sister.  She made me feel a ton better.  I went to my room and was just chilling out when my daughter knocked on my door and came in.  She said ""are you still mad?""  I was able to honestly say, ""No, I'm fine."" We made some small talk which reinforced that I was ok, and I had moved on.  

My old self would have been high at that time, and she would have known and probably would have been feeling upset herself.  We would have had a bad few days most likely.  

I also want to put in another plug for Tara Brach's Radical Acceptance.  An easy tool of hers is RAIN:  Recongize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture.  I try to use these to work through tough issues when I feel angry or sad or any other negative emotion.  It helps me to work through it rather than to reach for a drug to escape.",35

I was not only smoking every single day, multiple times a day, but I was smoking so much. I always just wanted to rip the bong again and again. It makes me sad to think of all the times I canceled or skipped plans because I was too high and just wanted to stay home and smoke alone or go to sleep. 

I’ve never even been an adult without smoking everyday. I went through maybe a 6 month period where I was moderating my use, and in the last 2 years or so I did smoke less, transitioning to only at night on the weekdays because of work but still throughout the day on the weekends.

I've tried to quit probably ten times in the last year. Usually don't make it past a couple days. But a few days ago I found this sub, and it's really been heartening to see people who take a weed problem seriously. It's very hard to explain to your casual smoking friends that weed may not be scientifically addictive (whatever that means), but it is functionally addictive. At least for me. 

After looking through this sub for the last couple days I am more confident than ever. I have strategies in place and plans for what to do when cravings hit. I know it will still suck, but I'm really thinking it might stick this time.",1

I just got through college fine, have a happy relationship that's been going well for almost 3 yrs, am currently building myself up as a music producer/engineer and have been finding a cash flow at least through that. Honestly the most detrimental part of weed for me has only ever been spending money on it, I've been fortunate enough to be able to function through the high without issue really. When rappers come through to record with me usually I end up getting smoked down, so even when I've wanted to take t breaks it's just always been so nearby and convenient and seemed always generally harmless for me, so having a period of getting away from it just hasn't really happened.

I think this has been the problem for me for so long. It just doesn't seem like anything's really wrong or like I'm being held back by it much. However I know with my goals and ambitions they are likely more secure if I just sober up. I also know that I can't sustain spending money on weed while I'm investing in myself, and if life's opportunities are what you make of them, then I know I could make the most of them if I was 100% focused and sober. I've always just seemed to get by while being high as shit and I think I'm kind of over just getting by, I want to thrive now. Really trying to learn to deny myself just for my own good, even if what I'm doing is only harming myself in these miniscule ways. 

I dunno. I guess if just anyone has any wisdom on this headspace I'd appreciate it. I think I want to completely quit but everyone I live with smokes, everyone I work with smokes, everyone I hang out with smokes. How can I get to the point of saying ""I'm Good"" and mean it? How can I see this substance in a more negative light as it relates to me?",88

I dont crave nicotin in other settings so I think there is synergy between both substances (can anyone relate?) 
I have one smoke left for tonight and then I’m going cold turkey. 
I plan to keep a diary of symptoms and feelings to see how I am managing and track progress. Every time I attempt to stop I normally start smoking again after the flood of emotions get too much for me to handle. I notice the amount I need to smoke is higher each time... endless vicious circle.

I've never felt fully convinced that my problem for the last 12 years has been weed. It was always my anxiety, my depression, my lack of money, my lack of structure, familial or social support—even my bowels!—that caused my irritability, destroyed my follow-through, sapped my desire to interact with other people or engage meaningfully with myself. Weed helped my creativity! Weed made me nicer! Weed chilled me out! 

But after my second night in a week confronting some pretty scary thoughts, I've been on this sub for three hours now, reading post after post, NOT smoking, and realizing what I knew all along: that the only thing weed does for me is make me miserable. 

Two years ago, I watched my dad helplessly flail through the DTs while strapped to a hospital bed when he tried quitting booze cold-turkey, and I felt such acute disappointment when he checked himself out of inpatient rehab after an eight-day stay. I spent my childhood dealing with the effects of his addiction, and here I am, fully addicted to a substance and internally doing everything I can to tell myself otherwise.

I'm having a really hard time wrapping my head around this, and I'm feeling just as ridiculous for not being able to see and accept the issue in such black-and-white terms. I am addicted! End of story. Why is that so difficult? I smoke weed to pull myself out of the funk weed puts me in!! 

I've smoked daily, multiple times per day, for 12 years. I'm furious with myself for letting it get to this point and, somewhat dramatically, I'm terrified it's too late to meaningfully recover what I've lost. I know that that's not true, and that I'm going to have a lot of thoughts like these in the coming days, weeks, months, years? Fuck. Years! 

I know everyone here has heard this before, has been here before, and I'm not sure what support I'm after, even? It just feels good to write these thoughts down and attempt to hold myself accountable for something I should have done years ago. I'm 32 on July 10, and I think I'm quitting for my birthday.

Life has changed drastically since I used to be a stoner, and at the start this year I became increasingly intrigued with reintroducing Weed  for therapeutic and recreational benefits.

June 8th was the day I started smoking again and here’s what’s happened;

I exercised only once since ( I exercise and cross train daily, running, cycling, weight etc usually).  
I basically forgot that for 15yrs of my life I never worked out because Weed creates a force field of contentment with laziness. I’ve managed to reshape my life over the last 4 years to be a generally healthier individual .

I no longer identify with being a stoner but that’s what I’ve been doing these last 3 weeks and it’s been amazing to realize how I used to be to how I’ve grown to be so lazy.

So my quest to be a stoner again has yielded results. Cannabis is no longer of any real benefit to me. 


If anything it’s been largely negative. People have noticed how “stoned” I’ve become. Somebody picked it up at work that I was  tired looking etc. I found this embarrassing.

My girlfriend prefers the older version of me who looks after himself and doesn’t lounge around gaining weight and struggling to stay conscious because I’m so monged. 

I have a wheeze again after 5 years or good respiratory health.

I’ve put on over a stone in weight over the last few weeks too. Damn munchies 

So tomorrow I start without it. Exercise and healthy eating. And some sleepers for possible insomnia if needed.

If it wasn’t for everyone’s posts here I wouldn’t have been able to get through the days. So thank you all so much.

For the past two years I’ve been smoking almost daily but during quarantine it’s been more of a constant thing. A week ago when my partner had to leave town for work I said to myself this is when I give up. 

When my partner is out of town is usually my “indulgement” time, I get to smoke in the house and whenever I want. (My partner gave up smoking a few years ago because they recognized a dependency I always refused to acknowledge). The moment I realized how much I was hiding my smoking from them I realized how bad my dependency really was.

This past week has been on and off! Haven’t been sleeping very well and I get a little irritated when I don’t “get my way”. Usually when I was stoned all the time I never really had an opinion about things but now how I see it is that I actually care about things.

I started smoking about 11 years ago in college. I started with friends while hanging out, and when I finally found the confidence to find a dealer, I started smoking alone in my apartment. I got used to this until I had to stop due to work-related testing. When I changed jobs to something less restrictive on my lifestyle, I went right back only this time I smoked only socially for most of last 5 years. 2019 is where things really reached new heights. I started buying bags to keep at home, not sure why I thought this was an improvement in my state of life, like I had somehow made it. My sleeping habits deteriorated and I started compensating by using stimulants like caffeine, monster and redbull. Resetting my days using melatonin became a habit every few weeks. I stopped writing my journal and eventually stopped thinking deeply before I spoke, which is something I had made a habit. Talking at people and reacting rather than pausing and setting up my thoughts clearly. My thoughts became catchphrases and eventually I started just repeating what people had said as if they were my own thoughts. I stopped working on my hobbies, couldn't plan for more than a few hours and forgot important plans for work, business and friendships. I forgot the love language of my 5-year relationship, probably the strongest friendship I had built. I just forgot why it was important and what we were building up to. I forgot self-love, replaced with self-denial and eventually self-hate. My social life revolved around getting getting high on more than just weed, relying on X and not respecting the need to regenerate serotonin before rolling again.  Eventually my emotional intelligence dropped so much I couldn't express myself clearly. I became emotionally abusive because it became easier to lash out than face the internal challenge of seeing myself and saying exactly what I saw without judgment. I became an anxious, nervous mess. So I dumped my girlfriend because I couldn't find a way to express myself to her any more without second guessing and therefore hiding. Not that I wouldn't have told her I loved her in the same breath, I just didn't know what any of it meant any more. Even for myself. I quickly realized that the next step was suicide so I called family in the worst week of my life and started what became 14 weeks of therapy that helped me recover my sense of joy in living.

Fast-forward to March 2020. When the pandemic lockdowns started I somehow believed things would be different. That I had cleared up the negative cycles of thought. So I dove back in again. I bought a bag every few weeks. New gear too: pipe, 2 vapes (wtf for!) Again, all in isolation and with my eyes glued to either my laptop or my phone nearly 12 hours a day, telling myself I'm ""working"". I can't show anything for the time I've spent because everything I started was interrupted every time things seemed a little difficult. Now I'm feeling pretty much the same as I was in September. I'm anxious about even the safest social signals I can send for help. I've started writing a post like this since May.

So here I am. So much self-neglect. Why? All for a few hours of fog and food cravings? I say fuck that. I can enjoy my work without weed, I have enjoyed the same music without weed, the same conversations, the same books. The extra dose of not-being-focused on the present just doesn't do it for me any more. So I'm done. I trashed my stash, squashed the last joint. Didn't even try to finish it. Why? I'm good. Remember to say the magic words. 

I'M GOOD. 

With many attempts at quitting behind me, I have finally seen these consequences, what I have actually been working towards this whole time i.e. how smoking weed replaced my motivation for life, as the reasons why I do not need weed in my life.

 I value challenge, and weed has made me complacent. I must see my own future with new eyes. Those of self-compassion, love for self and other, clarity and honesty.

Thank you for reading this far and I hope your journey is helped along by this one here.

Peace out, my loves.

It was once i finished writing and looked at that page that I realized I would not have been able to even perform the task of remembering my dreams, let alone getting out of bed to write them down (I used to lay in bed for at LEAST an hour just watching youtube and wasting time for nothing) if I were smoking.

This cycle of quitting for around a month then smoking again is starting to become a habit in itself.

It's a very strange feeling. When I'm smoking, I'm not really enjoying it. The first couple of weeks after stopping again feel great, but slowly the cravings creep back in.

I'm 41 and have been smoking weed since i was 15 or so. Lately due to family and life circumstances i've been smoking a lot. Like, a lot! 

I moved back with my mum about a year ago to look after her after she was in hospital for 17 months with kidney failure. 

For the past year i've smoked pretty much all the time; but always able to provide for my mum such as making her food, changing her diapers and organizing/taking her to her appointments. I did all this whilst tapering benzos. 

About 6 months ago my mum's nephrostomy tube fell out of her kidney. I couldn't drive her to the hospital as i was high af. So we called an ambulance and they took her to the hospital and i followed about 2 hours later. I had to get sober to drive. 

I'm scared guys. My mum is relatively stable but anything could happen at any time so i need to be sober if and when something happens. 

I'm on day 3 of quitting and it's awful(you know how it is).but reading all your posts provide me with the inspiration needed to get clean. 

Thank you.",5

When you quit that is when you know your actualy state of mind based on reality.

Coz trust me no matter how incomplete you feel or the void you feel when you don't smoke up , atleast it's us facing the reality.

During the quarantine I had been trying to lose weight, eat healthier and do more with my time yet cannabis had always held me back. After realizing how pathetic I was in that moment and how weed drives me to over eat and be lazy for entire days I decided it was time to stop.

I have been smoking and vaping cannabis for around 14 years now and I have always wanted to quit. My parents let me smoke weed with them in high school so I thought it was cool and picked up the habit at a very young age. However The drug makes me lazy, hungry, self deprecating and turns my inner dialogue into one of self doubt and regret.

The thought of smoking weed and drinking has been built up in our minds as something fun people do and a way to let loose and relax but I've always found the opposite in both cases. Weed alters me in a way I do not like and drinking has never seemed like a fun activity.

In any case I've been more active, picked up painting as a hobby, eating healthier and smaller portions. I let me friends know that I'm sober and asked them to cool it on the weed use around me. I signed up for courses to apply to the coast guard in the fall. I'm really looking forward to a life where I don't think about weed or have the inclination to use it to increase my 'enjoyment' of music or food etc. (most times I just forget everything because of it.) 

 I highly anticipate when the brain fog clears because sometimes I just can't remember things that seem so easy, but my mind just doesn't click quite yet. One pro/cons is that I don't feel I need to sleep nearly as long but I also miss the days where I can sleep for ten hours but now I can get 6-7 hours and wake up in the morning feeling ready to get going with my day.

I thought I'd share my experience with this community for people who feel similar and want to quit as well. 

It's worth it, you don't need weed to enjoy life.

At this moment the struggle is real
at this moment its hard to describe 
How I feel






I remember a time when everything seemed like peace
the time where i was just getting to know how to burn  the trees
they showed me happiness, in a cloudy dream
they showed me the fun in monotony
I reveled in them since sixteen 
and time traveled  very quickly







Every day going faster and alas
the common constant was the grass
it stayed in my life and helped hardship pass
being an aggresive young lad 
people saw me calm and thought
he grew up at last






but it was the heavy use
the dependence of a crutch to avoid the truth
being a addicted was the reality I refused
the opportunities that passed because I  was too 






lost in the trees and it became a part of me
not realizing that my anxiety was a biproduct of Lucy. 
My depression fueled by burning means
and now that ive left the forest hopefully








For  the 4th time in years I realized that I dont want to come back here. 
looking in the mirror and I seem queer. 
The weakness in my soul was something to fear, transcending the evil Lucy and becoming a dear
ally of good for all that are near. 
But now that im here





I hope that i can see, how to save the forest from the arsony and with  bravery ill confront my deep seated pain and hopefully escape this addiction before its too late. 







as I flee I  am reminded that this is for me,
this change is for a future of harmony. 
this change is for a better outcome to beat Lucy
this change is so I can see, 
The forest for the trees the truth that remains in just the leaves.",12

I’m in my second year of college now.

Instead I’ll elaborate on what I’m doing right now to overcome this addiction. For starters, the only thing I’m quitting at the moment is weed. Before I tried to tackle multiple things at once, but too much change will overwhelm you to the point where you fall into the same old nasty habits. Some people can persist like this, but most addicts can’t. I’m on day 2 right now, and I feel content. Withdrawals aren’t nearly as bad when you try to quit one thing at a time.

It was my escape and my coping mechanism. But I found an online community, and fell in love with it, and knew that if I wanted to be part of it all I had to quit smoking. Pot ruined my ability to talk to people, have conversations, and I just hated how I acted on it because I wanted to be taken seriously.

Before this, pot just got me into trouble. Relationships where I was used. I wasn't a friend, I was the person who either brought the pot or bought it from you. I thought I had friends. But when I stopped going above and beyond, nobody stepped out to me. I was just used. One friend, I even opened up to her about something, was on the verge of tears, and she just left me there. Got up and left the room. And I remember just sitting there and staring at the door wondering what I'd done wrong. Id been there for her as much as I could, brought food, brought pot, listened, played games. And the one time I asked for an ear she just... left. There were more times, where I was just fucking *used* and shown I'm worthless, disposable, or only good for one or two things. I stopped fucking trying. I kept getting hurt.

So it's not even like I had friends when I quit smoking.

Back to the online community. I quit. I'm clean. I'm part of this awesome community, we send mail, organize movie nights, play games. I love it. I love them. I've visited with a few of them.

But I'm fucking lonely. And I miss having ""friends"". Even if they used me. At least I could pretend someone within five hundred miles gave a damn.

And my mom. She loved me when I smoked. I was easier to get along with, I guess. But only because I was happy to get high off my ass and do nothing. I didn't hold any opinions, didn't speak up. Just was a super dumbed down, giggly, version of me.

She loved me more as a pothead. ""You were happy when you smoked. Then you quit and you went back to being... *you*.""

That crushes me every time I think about it. I know I'm not happy all the fucking time, like I was when I was high.  But... I'm better off than when I was just high. For a lot of reasons. Hobbies, skills, whatever. I'm doing better.

Before the virus, I was about to turn my life around. I'll spare you the story. But I wouldn't have gotten as far as I did when I smoked.

It's not really like I can go out and find new friends anyhow, with the pandemic. Sober or high.

I could go in much more detail how deranged and far from reality my brain was. But I think I got the point across.
I have to admit I still smoke cigarettes (which I know is way worse) and occasionally drink alcohol.
But I have to say smoking weed (even though it was cool for about 4 years) nearly destroyed my life and my mind.
Today I know that if I smoke again I’ll just go down that road again and it’s just not worth it, trust me. Now i haven’t smoked in over a year and six months and I don’t plan on going back

I had been smoking daily for nearly two years, and consistently for the better part of a decade. It started affecting my job and personal life. Since quitting I’ve been reading SO much more, which has been a goal of mine for years. I’ve also gotten back into regular biking and yoga, too. Huge perks! Except I still wish I had a little weed to relax with every once in awhile.

Enter edibles. 

I’ve never been a huge edibles person, but I liked the idea of a high experience every now and again, in the same vein of using psychedelics. Unfortunately, The high feels quite different, more physical and, for me, INCREDIBLY DEPRESSIVE. This past week I tried two separate evenings at one fairly high dose and one normal/low dose, and boy both times fucking sucked. I’m not sure I’m willing to figure out what dosage works for me since the last two doses I tried were wayyyyy too high (and I thought I had a high tolerance). Either way, it’s definitely made me associate the feeling of being high with a lot of negativity. It reminded me of all the times I hated being high. Not saying this is a route I recommend, but I more so want to ask if any of you have found unlikely processes to quitting other than cold turkey.

Usually I only did one at night, right before eating dinner and going to bed. Occasionally I would take a couple GBs during the day, like if it was the weekend or if I had off from work. 

When quarantine took effect and I had to work from home, my GBing really spiraled out of control. From mid-March to mid-May I was taking 4+ GBs a day. I'd wake up and rip a GB, take another one a few hours later when the high wore off, and then repeat that cycle until I went to bed. This habit began to feel incredibly unfulfilling. I was convinced that if I wasn't GBing so frequently, I would be more motivated to find a relationship, work on improving my professional skills, spend time developing hobbies, etc. 

One day, after experiencing some bad post-GB headaches, I said ""enough is enough"" and I threw out the eighth I had recently purchased and barely tapped into. Roughly $50 down the drain. Impressively I stuck with my sobriety. I didn't purchase any weed, nor did I resort to taking up other drugs/alcohol. I figured, once I got my appetite back and realigned my sleep schedule, that my motivation to do work would just naturally return as well. However, here I am, 45 days sober, and I'm still spending a lot of my time watching television and playing video games. I am working out a lot more and my diet is healthier than it's ever been, but overall I feel lazy and unproductive. The only difference is that now I'm being unproductive sober.

Has anyone else who's quit for a while encountered a similar struggle with regaining motivation? And does anyone have any tips for increasing productivity after ditching weed?",2

I have immense gratitude for this sub. It has been a great source of information and motivation. This is a new account. I wanted to give back to the sub, hence this post. It is a journey of how I have reached here. I am listing down my experiences in the hope that it helps others in their own journey.

**Background**

I tried weed in my late teens and it was in my early 20s when I started smoking on daily. I always thought of myself as a functional stoner and smoking up as a harmless habit. Marijuana enhanced my creativity, introduced me to amazing people, allowed me to appreciate music, food and art. It helped me have an alternative take on things. I thought it was a great enabler until it wasn't. The relaxation from smoking up was replaced by worry. Before I knew it, I was dependent on it to enjoy things. Every day activities had to be preceded by smoking up. I used it as a comfort blanket. No matter what happened in the day, I could put it all aside and smoke a joint.

**First-steps of the journey**

I got introduced to meditation a few years back and during one of the sessions, I brought my awareness to the dependency aspect of weed. I remember asking myself as to why my happiness was held hostage to smoking up. I wanted to be free from smoking up to be happy. I wanted to explore life without being dependent.

I came across this article from the sub:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5yzwyr/tutorial\_how\_to\_quit\_weed\_and\_be\_happy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5yzwyr/tutorial_how_to_quit_weed_and_be_happy/)

Once I read this post, there was no looking back.I wasn't going to smoke up. Period.

But little did I realise how difficult it would be to let go of a 8 year old habit.My initial withdrawal symptoms were: extreme anxiety, night-sweats, insomnia, nightmares etc

This was followed by DP/DR, suicidal ideation, depression and intrusive thoughts.

I thought there was something genuinely wrong with me until I read the experiences of [u/pawsleaves](https://www.reddit.com/u/pawsleaves/) on the sub-reddit

I realised I was going through PAWS (Post-Acute-Withdrawal-Symptoms)

**Recovery**

Years of abuse left me with the following inadequacies:

* Inability to handle emotions and thoughts
* Inability to relax without weed
* Inability to concentrate for long periods of time
* Inability to handle stress without a coping mechanism

All these inadequacies coupled with the PAWS left me with no footing. I could not hide behind a smoke filled haze anymore. Who was I? Some made up identity forged on mistakes and self-deception. The thing about addiction is you lose yourself to the substance being abused. You become the substance and lose the person.

I wanted to know myself. I really did.

This was my first step on the road to recovery - Knowing my self, rediscovering my child like enthusiasm.

I don't know how it works for everyone but according to me if you have to change a long habit, you have to change who you are. And that is a journey, it's not a weekend retreat or a 90-day course.

**Essential steps in my journey**

1. *Re-establishing relationships* \- I came clean to my mom about my habit. This was an immense sense of relief. I no longer hid things from anyone. This lead to mutual trust which is important for relationships to thrive. You need a sound social structure in life. Quitting weed made me realise I was ignoring my relationships. I worked on them and reaped the benefits. Most of my friends smoke up, it was tough to hangout with them initially. I was lucky enough to have a few friends I could talk to about my recovery. Having the support of friends and family was of great help. I still miss hanging out and socialising with the old group but I am working on it.
2. *Meditation -* Like I mentioned, I was meditating before I stopped smoking. Meditating helped me center myself. Allowed me to have a calm perspective. There have been few occasions where thoughts keep repeating on few topics. Intrusive thoughts. I didn't know how to handle them. I was reacting to them which made things worse. Through meditation I was able to observe them calmly. Everytime there is a 'thought-binge' I observe and then go about with my work. Headspace is a great app to start with.
3. *Mindfulness -* Mindfulness is being aware of the current moment. I started practicing it. With practice I became aware of what I was doing at the present moment. For example - If I was at a music concert, ideally I would be listening to the musician. But while I am listening to the musician, I am also looking at the cute girl beside me, thinking of what to eat, worry about work, wonder if I can get a good night's sleep. You get the drift. Once I became aware of this, I slowly practiced on staying in the present moment. It changed things for the better. I am practising this daily and hope to get better at concentrating.
4. *Stress management -* What do you do when you're stressed? Smoke a joint. And what do you do when you can't do that? You're helpless. I had to learn healthy ways of managing stress. Especially at work. The way I see it, there's unnecessary stress and stress you can't help. You have to identify unnecessary stress. It could be as simple as stress from inability to impress colleagues/your boss at work. That's unnecessary suffering. No one can control what others think. Letting go of what is not in my control cut my stress drastically.
5. *Emotional intelligence* \- They say men reach emotional intelligence much later in life compared to women. I tend to agree. Emotions are what make life happening. They add flavour to life. And if the flavour is bad, your dish is spoilt. In this case the dish is you. I repressed my emotions using marijuana because I didn't know what else to whenever I came face to face with a negative emotion. Although I didn't practice CBT with a therapist, I read the literature. I understood the relationship between thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Emotions happen and finish. If you worry about the emotion happening, you add more to the emotion. It becomes a tough cycle to get out of. I allowed myself to feel my emotions. Labelled my emotions. Used journaling and talking to friends to express my emotions. Seek help and educate yourself if you're facing difficulty with emotions. To emote naturally is to be human.
6. *Spirituality/Religion -* This is personal territory. It's entirely your choice. In my case, I became more open to things and was blessed with great happenings in my life. Here's an article which inspired me: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhj1m3/a\_true\_story\_from\_stoner\_to\_surgeon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhj1m3/a_true_story_from_stoner_to_surgeon/)

**In conclusion**

What started out as journey to quit weed and improve myself ended up putting me on a path of self-discovery. Everyday I learn something new about myself, the world we live in and the nature around us. It has been the most difficult yet the most fulfilling endeavour I have ever taken up. It might sound like a generic fleeting statement but I genuinely mean it. I fell in love with myself in a non-self absorbent way. I started being kind and compassionate to people and ended up being kind and compassionate to myself. I am continuing on this life-long journey to discover myself, work towards my purpose.

All my PAWS symptoms stopped, vanished and reduced drastically while I was recovering. It takes patience. And whatever difficulties I do face now, I know will resolve. It keeps getting better

And finally, I took ownership. I took ownership of everything. Even the bad things. It became liberating. It seems counter- intuitive right? You're responsible for the bad things in your life, how is that liberating? That's because no one else can claim responsibility of anything in your life. You become the true architect, the captain of your life. If you can guide your ship into murky waters, you have the power to correct the course too. That has left me with self-belief. A quiet sense of confidence.

I hope the post has been of help. Your drug use and addiction doesn't have to define you. I wish you strength in your journey!",11

After about 6 weeks sober (after about 2 years of daily smoking), I've realized how different I am at my core from how I thought I was. My view of myself has drastically changed.

I used to think I was hedonistic; I chased what would make me happy, as happiness was the ultimate goal. If I wasn't happy, I'd smoke. Sometimes that would work, but only temporarily. Now I've realized that being happy all the time is unattainable. Now I chase contentedness. My days now are more relaxing, and as others have said, I feel like I was playing life on hard mode. I still have anxieties, but the number of anxieties has decreased dramatically. I'm not afraid of going to jail, or running out of money, or running out of weed. I now just exist in contentedness.

I am a believer in a sort of yin yang dualism, wherein every choice comes with a benefit and a detriment. We are constantly evaluating each choices pros and cons. I will not say that weed is bad, but what I've realized is that it does more negative than positive for me. That may not be the case for everyone, but marijuana culture needs to understand that that *is* the case for some.

I am in control of my life. Maybe my peaks are not as high, but for me, the valleys are not nearly as low, and that is 100% worth it.

I hope this helps someone :)",22

A lot of people on this forum started smoking marjuana when they were in high school or university, i did neither. I started smoking at age 24 and immediately my relationship with it became unhealthy. At the time I had gone through a divorce, I had alot of pain within me, I wasn't in a good place.  I had a friend who would smoke multiple times daily. One day she went for a walk at night, and invited me, on the walk she smoked, and passed me it ( as if to be polite), I didn't refuse. This then became daily until i started to ask to buy my own batch, eventually I got the dealers number. Mind you all, this happened within a few short months but became a few years. Many people here smoked everyday consistently, i didnt. I kept trying and trying to quit. The more I smoked, the more I not only lost people in my life but also myself. I smoked to numb the pain within me, i smoked to stop the fears, i smoked to make all the negative thoughts go away.... A joint a day turned into 4 easily, sometimes more. I have high tolerance so when I smoked, I'd smoke a lot! No tiny joints ever. Anyways, i had enough of running away from my problems, they weren't going anywhere, I was just collecting them on my shoulders. I had enough. I'm actually a very social person by nature so I'm looking forward to being myself again but that will take time, I will be patient. I have only been able to stop smoking weed for a month straight and then I give in, and when I do I spend way too much money. My friend who smokes daily for several years use to tell me I smoke way too much. I don't want to ever smoke again. I know myself, I have an addictive personality. I need to love and respect myself, I deserve better. I choose to live a healthy life. I'm chosing to tackle my issues and throw them away. I'm ready for LIFE, to LIVE. I'm hopeful.

I’ve quit a bunch of times and every time I get positive results only to fall off the wagon a few weeks later. I don’t think I’ve been conscious and sober for more than like 4 hours at ALL since quarantine started. 

I was a reasonably successful local stand up comedian for a while, once upon a time. I was good. I was young. I was different and talented. Making people laugh is like a drug on its own. My material was sharp and relatable and even though I was never the best off the cuff because I was blazed all the time, I almost always got my laughs.  I’ve opened for some famous people you’ve definitely heard of. I did all of this in under a year. If I had stuck to it who knows where I would be now?

That was years ago. I lost all my progress because I couldn’t be relied on, I’d forget to rehearse for shows and do mediocrely. I stopped the grind and the hustle because it was hard and I was high all the time. I wound up in a shitty customer service job that makes me want to die every day. I’m broke and living with 4 roommates and almost 30 years old with 0 real accomplishments and 0 impulse control. Pot is the tip of the iceberg for me, but it’s such a quick and easy comfort and I already miss it. I hate feeling shitty all the time. 

I need help. I know I do. I feel completely lost and hopeless and that if I don’t make a change soon I’m going to be stuck for the rest of my life. But I can’t afford therapy and NA meetings make me feel like I’m in a weird cult (no offense to anyone who has gotten results this way. Good for you!  But I was raised in an ultra religious environment I hated and am now totally allergic to anything that reminds me of those days). I really hope I can find some support here.

2020-07-04 02:06:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkyizu/coming_up_on_two_years/,Coming up on two years,"I am less than three weeks away from my two year anniversary of quitting.

It's kind of crazy how far I've come. When I quit, I did so largely because I was fed up with the state my life was in. I was living with my parents, working a dead end job, drowning in debt. Since then I've started an actual career, moved to a different city, and paid off all my debt.

I would say that by 9 months, I didn't really think about it that much anymore. I may have got cravings if exposed to a trigger, but generally I wasn't counting the days any more. Being sober became the new norm.

However, as I'm approaching the two year mark, I find myself thinking about smoking a lot. I'm kind of planning to start smoking again after I reach that milestone.

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this. I guess I'm hoping someone will talk me out of it. And honestly, I think I'm talking myself out of it just by writing it. If you were to ask *why* I'm planning to start smoking again, then my answers would be unsatisfactory:

* ""I'm bored with life.""
* ""I think it will make me enjoy life more.""
* ""I quit because I didn't like where I was in life and needed as much motivation as possible to dig myself out of that hole. Now I'm in a good place so it wouldn't hurt to light up after work and on the weekends.""

The problem with the first two answers is that using a drug to deal with boredom or to make me enjoy myself more is probably a maladaptive coping strategy.

If I'm bored, I should find a new hobby or set new goals. The thing is, my life has been so goal oriented ever since I quit, and I think smoking would allow me to take a break from the goals, and truly unwind and relax.

As for the third answer, if I'm in such a good place, then why am I bored, and why do I feel like I need a drug to enjoy myself? Well, I meant that I'm in a good place as far as career and money are concerned. But I basically have no life outside of work. I come home and just work from home. I think smoking would allow me to disconnect from work and just relax when I'm at home.

Has anyone else returned to smoking after being sober for a long time? Did you regret it? Were you able to use more responsibly than before?",10

Left the work force in a shitty expensive city, moved back in with my folks and took a part time job, cut down on my smoking a little. All to get back into school. 
Guys, I just failed all my online spring classes. Hard.
I made it through the fall, struggled over winter but got my ""A."" Part of that struggle was related to the pt job I had. My boss hired for positions I offered to fill. And as soon as his work load lessened, he started coming into work freshly baked. Stinking up the whole place like he had his stash on him. I quit, told him all I needed to. But the damage was done. I was eating instead of smoking. And then I was smoking again.
I rolled spliffs. My lungs suck, and I've dabbed and quit and packed bowls and quit and even cigarettes were easy to 86. But a hippie speedball was my favorite way to start the mornings.
Escapism. That's all it is. I'm an absolute mess and I needed to dull the edges of my life. My mind, when I'm bored, canabalizes itself to extremes. Even games and TV can't keep the pain at bay unless I'm stoned.
It's been 3 days since my last spliff. 2 days ago I smoked half a cigarette, and a bit more than 24hrs ago I smoked half a pinch of what was left of a deconstructed joint I found on my car floor.
Living with my folks has its pros and cons, we typically get along very well. Lately it's been stressful. They drink. Every night. And getting high made that tolerable. They're not bad or mean drunks. Just drunks and that's always bothered me.
Last night I snapped at Mom. I've snapped at myself a half dozen times today. I'm freaked out, angry, sad, or numb. And I can't seem to experience joy.
I live in the PNW of North America and it's beautiful here. The hikes, the scenery, should inspire some kind of good feels, but they're not doing it for me.
I'm just so frustrated. I want to diminish these ugly thoughts and smoke, but I don't want what little effort I've put in to go to waste. Again.

If this raises any red flags for you, dear readers, try not to worry. I've seen what my rock bottom looks like. Down there lies not a positive motivator for living, but an absolute fear of dissapointing my folks with death.

This is what I did to myself, with the help of weed. This is what a decade of unfettered use looks like. I'm an example of a person who shouldn't have ever started.

TL;DR: withdrawal sucks. Rebalancing is hard. I don't know if I can.",5
2020-07-03 20:42:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkucc4/day_67/,Day 67,"My early adulthood is now divided into two parts: when I smoked weed and after I quit. The two periods don't share any similarities.

The warmth in my chest, the free flow of my words in a conversation, the untamable energy when I'm listening to music, the hunger for new and sensual friendships, the bravery of standing up for myself - these are the characteristics of the new period. Their respective antonyms were the characteristics of life with weed.

I'm so privileged and lucky - I didn't think anything would happen magically after I quit weed, but it fucking did. Everything I wished for happened. Now I've got a lot more dreams and aspirations.

Goddammit I LOVE LIFE. I'm saying that as someone who repeated the words ""I wanna die"" multiple times a day for the last few years.

Oh how I wish the same wondrous transformation will happen to everyone on this life-changing sub 🙏",22

2020-07-03 13:46:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hknj5i/3_weeks_into_the_processes/,3 weeks into the processes.,"I started smoking nic in 10th grade(15). Then I moved to smoking pens n tree my junior year. I wasn’t to crazy about smoking my junior year I just did with the boys. My senior year was a completely different story....I know it’s not as bad compared to everyone, who have been smoking for years but it has greatly impacted my life. I have a lot of personal issues I deal with, and coming from a Hispanic household it’s very tough to come out n speak about yo issues. So I’ve always resorted to smoking then actually face my personal issues. About a year ago before my senior year, my dad was issued a deportation order, he had 2 months to leave and I was in such a low state. Around that same time I broke up w someone. I started to excessively smoke everyday, and I would do it before school. I was always high in class and I had all AP classes. This greatly impacted my grades and my chances of going into my dream school. My GPA dropped from a 3.8 to a 2.9 at the end of the year. I ended up getting accepted to a university because of a SAT score but regardless it affected my life. My dad went into hiding from immigration and I had to live w my mom the majority of my senior year so going to smoke was pretty easy. But Recently I’ve decided to get my life together as I lost everyone close from school, and I only get to see my dad every other week. I start university in January for spring term. I know, no will probably care but I just wanted to share my ideals n experience. As I know many high schoolers will probably fall into drugs and ruin their lives. just understand there’s always a light at the end of the door and I don’t plan on stopping these 3 weeks. I will keep y’all updated for 2 months. Thank you for listening",13
2020-07-03 13:36:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hknck5/id_like_to_talk_about_the_processapproach_im/,I'd like to talk about the process-approach I'm taking to quitting,"So, I've been struggling since April to get back to my sober self. I think that just like a lot of you guys, I wasn't able to quit cold turkey and stay that way without relapsing. I've relapsed and I felt shitty about it, guilty, nervous and it took me 3 weeks - after ruining a ~20 day pause - to stop again. And so I did. Then I managed to stay sober again for 15 days, but messed that up.

 So now I'm getting closer to 15 days again and the point I want to make with this rambling is: I had 3 joints since my last long-relapse, meaning I smoked maybe 2 days out of so many. I used to smoked 4 - 5 joints every. single. day.  I want to get to a point where I don't need cheat days to feel like I'm in control of this. But I do feel that after relapsing a couple of times and just pushing foward, being forgiving towards myself, NOT BUYING IT AT ALL, learning that I'm not perfect but that my intentions are good, I'm getting closer to not needing to smoke. I crave it a lot less since I first tried to quit. I might cave again, but I will pick myself up and continue on this journey. The point of this is not ""regulate until you make it"" cause I know that for most people in here a healthy relationship with weed is not even on the table. But do have a healthy relationship with yourself and be ready to start trying again everytime you fail. It's ok to fail. I swear it is. And when you get back up, you feel stronger. Here's to whatever day you're in, and if it is day one again: you can do this! Stay safe, people! :)",13
2020-07-03 13:17:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkn026/my_thoughts_on_a_six_year_song_and_dance_with_weed/,My thoughts on a six year song and dance with weed,"I first discovered weed at 18. I fell in love at first time. I loved the euphoria, the state of unawareness, the sound of the bong bubbling. I was smoking nearly every day. I would smoke before work. I would smoke after. I would smoke before the family Christmas party. I was high every day. 

When I was 19, I started experimenting with LSD. I would dose every few days and soon it became a habit. I was mixing it with weed and I began to buy random shit. A snake, a bass guitar I never used, and a plethora of books I never got around to reading were among my many impulse pot fueled purchases. 

Fast forward to 20 years old; I started hearing voices recurrently and I was getting scared. I decided to go to the hospital and be on medication. Anyone who's taken antidepressants or antipsychotics knows that weed and most medications DO NOT mix. I didn't care, I was still smoking every chance I got. I lost touch with my dreams and passions because I was getting high and playing video games. I was convinced by media and music that smoking weed everyday was the way to live and that there were no repercussions. 

I would never realize how wrong I was until a little over two months ago. I mixed hash with my antipsychotic and anti depressant and my heart started racing faster than a racehorse. I was terrified that this was it for me. I was going to die because of weed and there was nothing I could do about it. Fortunately, my HR went down after a few hours, but I learned a valuable lesson that day. 

Weed is not for me, nor will it ever be for me. Weed made me apathetic and turned my life into a living nightmare. I'm now 24 and because of my weed use I have no savings, a busted car I can't fix, and I still live with my mother. Basically, I fucked up my entire life because I traded long term fulfillment for short term ""happiness."" 

My advice for anyone younger than me who is considering quitting is: do it now. Do it while you still can. Don't let your friends peer pressure you into smoking 5 blunts and a rip of DMT from a bong. You are wasting your young life and healthy lungs. Go hike a mountain. Write a song, spend time with your family, read and write avidly. Don't throw your dreams away over a plant.",33

But it doesnt end there.

Today my uncle who hasnt been smoking for months, called me saying that he got some from his friend and asked if I wanted to come over to smoke. 

Then just now, a few minutes ago I found a little baggy next to a bank (wtf) with a little bit of weed crumbs left in it. 

But here is the deal: with my newly obtained clarity, I can see that this is just part of the bigger picture. The universe knows that I know, so it keeps sending me signs to remind me how strong I am, and that I can resist, despite all these things.

2020-07-03 12:40:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkmc36/today_i_quit/,Today I quit.,"Today I decided to quit smoking marijuana, although, these next 3 days are going to be extremely difficult given that I'll be around a ton of smokers. But I feel confident in myself that I can really do it this time around after trying and failing in the past.

I never use to be a marijuana user, I tried here and there in high school but it was never for me. Then a couple of years ago I started doing some design work for dispensaries and what not so I had easy access to cannabis and my SO and I began to smoke recreationally on weekends.

Weekends quickly became week days, week days quickly became every day, multiple times. We began having days of being high from 7am until 10pm at night. It became a behavioral habit that I felt like I needed to ""let go"" and ""stop thinking"". At the time, it worked. I would smoke and I felt like my overactive brain would stop thinking about all of my stresses. But, as my habit increased, my stresses and anxieties seeped into my highs and began to ruin them for me.

I started getting overly anxious and having catastrophic thoughts. Not to mention the horrible brain fog and groggy mornings where I didn't feel like myself until I smoked again or later that evening when my clarity came back.

It's also been an expensive habit that I've spent around $400-600 per month on because I'm buying for my fiance and myself.

I'll never talk badly about cannabis, I think it's a wonderful plant, I just blame myself for not having self control and letting a substance control me. I prefer smoking cannabis ANY DAY over alcohol as I've seen the damage that alcohol has created in my own life and people I know. But I think it's time to give marijuana a break.

I've made MASSIVE improvements in my life in the last 6 months such as eating right, exercising 5 days per week, counseling (some past trauma), yoga, good sleep, etc. But I think in order to really get where I need to go and fully ""heal"", I need to give it up.

I first smoked in 8th grade, but didnt really like how i couldnt focus while high, so i didn't do it again. But when I entered 9th grade I got curious again, and smoked with a friend. This time, I was hooked and would try to get smoked out by my friends any chance I had, and I ended up doing MDMA semi-regularly at some point too. When I entered 10th grade, I decided to cut out the MDMA. But I now had the money to buy my own weed, so I would smoke anywhere from 2 to 8 times a day, never skipping a day. This went on for 20 months until today. Starting this march, I also did psychedelics pretty regularly, thinking it would be the cure to my social anxiety (it wasn't). 

Now im just sitting here so pissed at myself for fucking my brain up at such a young age. I cant change what I did in the past few years and it's so frustrating. I have gained no real skills in the past few years other than rolling joints, packing bongs, ect. Friends have been offering me jobs lately, but I have been very reluctant to get one because I'm too socially anxious. I feel like ill fuck up my work and be yelled at and humiliated. Most entry-level jobs require working with the public and i definitely don't want that. And now with this pandemic I dont have a way to practice my social skills with peers. I feel so fucked. It's been 5 days since I last smoked I think. I flushed my stash yesterday incase i get cravings.

2020-07-03 10:54:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkkfrr/i_think_this_time_its_for_good/,I think this time it's for good,"I started smoking when I was 15 years old. It was an introduction into the partying life I eventually got into, but it also marked a step in my life away from my first real group of friends who abandoned me to a new group. I continued using all of high-school, save a few months off when I was in out-patient for non-drug-related mental health issues. In fact, the first time I went to outpatient I had never smoked before and chose to start while I was still going (genius right?). Anyways, fast forward to senior year of high school. I'd been through the gauntlet of mental health care. Attempts at my life, self-harm, hospitalizations, constant med changes, hopping from one group of friends to the next.   
Finally, at 18 years old I had things sorted out. I had a solid friend group, who I smoked with every weekend, but I never let it get in the way of my life. I move onto college and to my surprise, my normal amount of high energy (Ad/HD) turned a lot of people off and within 3 weeks I wanted to leave. What brought me together with the people on my floor was an aerator vape I had bought from my roommate. Once again, pot bringing me close together with people. Still, I was able to keep that balance and get my work done. Second semester I pledged a fraternity that did dry pledging so I smoked very little until the end of the semester. Over the summer I was at a friend's house smoking when all of a sudden I had the worst trip of my life. I had no idea why, everybody else was fine, but I was in such a bad state I wanted to have always been dead. 

After that, I was adamant about not smoking. I was clean for 7 months and was really good at rejecting my friends when they wanted to smoke. It affected my social life negatively but I still had friends, I just avoided the smoke sessions, which at that time were fairly often. By 4/20 of my sophomore year, it had been long enough that the trauma from that trip wore off and I smoked with my high-school friends while I was home on spring break. Things went fine after that. I was still getting shit done and my grades were always excellent. By Junior year the fraternity had started going to shit. The philanthropy work had stopped (the reason I joined) and people were getting hyperfocused on partying. I had had enough partying in high school and the first couple years of college so by this time I was totally over it. As a result, I ended up isolating myself from the fraternity, who I had spent most of my time in college getting close to. This is when I think the pot-smoking started to become an anti-social behavior instead of a social one. The guys were all drinking and doing party drugs and I wanted absolutely nothing to do with any of that. I became very reclusive, I had a girlfriend for a little bit and we would smoke together but when I had decided to go abroad for a semester and broke up with her I had pretty much sealed my fate of self-isolation. 

I lived in London for 3 and a half months and I hated almost every minute of it. This is when I first started to notice cravings for weed. My wish was fulfilled when my best friend who was studying in Paris at the time and I met up in Amsterdam. I really enjoyed my time there but I was also with my closest friend in the world so that kept me from going overboard. However, about a month later I went back on my own to spend a whole weekend using. I did almost nothing else. Now, when I was in London I lived in an apt. with 2 girls and a guy who made my life a living hell. They made a mess everywhere, treated me like shit, talked about me behind my back. As an aside, it had gotten so bad that a friend of the guy I lived with apologized to me IN PERSON when he saw me at the gym because his friend had told him how they were treating me and he felt really bad for me for having to go through that. But I digress. Point is when my roommates were all in Amsterdam for 4/20 celebrating I felt miserable that these people I hated got to enjoy the holiday. On a whim, I searched ""weed in London"" on Facebook and found a small private group. Within 45 minutes I was back at my apartment having picked up from some random dude I met on the page. The rest of my time there was marked by using and self-isolation. I ended up leaving the program 2 days early because I was so miserable there and I absolutely did not want to go to the end of the year party. I was so distraught I only told one person I was leaving and that's only because she saw me with my luggage waiting for a taxi.

Senior year rolls around, and most of my friends from the fraternity had graduated, and the people who were left were spending chapter money on drugs and just being overall irresponsible so I officially left the chapter as an early alumnus. I had almost no one. My little brother from the chapter was my neighbor and he was my only consistent friend. My life was basically school, smoking alone at home, or smoking with him. The only light in my life was working on a web show with a professor for credits so I could graduate on time. During this time I was a comedy writer but I knew full well that my constant use was affecting my writing and it was clear my brain was getting scrambled. Life became a boat with no sail, drifting on an empty ocean. occasionally I would meet a new person, male or female, usually a smoker, we would do our thing, then maybe hook up. I felt like a hollow person. I don't want to get too much more into detail about other experimenting I did drug wise as I'm nervous I may have triggered people already but let's just say I took something which sent me down a bad bad rabbit hole and left me with legitimate PTSD for over 2 years. 

Once out of school I had a degree but no job lined up. I moved back home and started working at a coffee shop. I had decided after graduation to stop smoking for the summer and get involved in the local music scene. That went well until I was offered to smoke by the guy I was organizing shows with. After that, it was back to using on my own. I would get high before and during work because the business was so slow I had maybe 10 customers per 7-hour shift. I moved onto a liquor store job, was sexually harassed by a manager and quit, then took a job in NYC at some advertising job which I still don't understand what they did. January 28th, 2017, I was out to dinner with 2 of my friends for my birthday. I got the news from one of them: a girl in our grade who struggled with drug abuse had passed. I had seen the girl a few months prior and didn't even recognize her because she had lost so much weight. I beat myself up incessantly for not talking to her. I know I wouldn't have saved her, but I wished I had acknowledged her. I didn't last long at the NYC job after that. I was in constant distress and I had gone back to self-isolation and smoking myself numb. I hit a breaking point and ended up in another outpatient for the first time since high-school. I wasn't there explicitly for use but I was drug tested while I went so I was clean for 5 months. I worked at another liquor store for a bit once I wasn't going to the center for full weeks. That ended with another bad situation involving me and a coworker, which I wont get into because it isn't relevant to this story. I quit on the spot the next time I was at work and moved with my mom to another town to hopefully start over. I was still clean and had plans to leave the country for 10 months to teach English in a foreign country. The plan was to save up over the summer and leave in the fall. I got the news the day I moved in: I was rejected because they didn't feel comfortable accepting someone with my psychological history after talking to my psychiatrist. I lost it. I dove headfirst. I actively looked for pot in my new environment and ended up smoking with my mom's friend's daughter and her friends. After that, I was always buying, always smoking. I worked and smoked and played video games and ate and that was my life for 2 years. 

At last, came what I thought was the final turning point. I had smoked with a friend at his apartment and went with him to the dollar store to get something to drink. We ran across a very busy street and I tripped, flew several feet and landed directly on my shoulder, dislocating and fracturing it. At first, I took this as a sign, but within a week I was back to daily use, this time to deal with the pain so I wouldn't have to take the painkillers they gave me. That got out of hand and I once again decided to take a break. I was one day clean when I got into a major car accident and totaled my car. I was distraught. At this time I was talking to a girl I would end up dating for 2 months. The relationship was alright but her big caveat was that I couldn't smoke if I was going to date her. Based on the previous few months I had i had no qualms about this. The relationship lasted 2 months before I ended it for various reasons, and I went back to smoking within a couple of weeks of that, and my usage was right back to where it was before I broke my shoulder. 

I started grad school for teaching last fall and decided to get a medical card to protect myself legally so I could work in education hassle-free. I poured so much money for the next 6 months into my usage. The stuff from the dispensary was almost 4x the price as the street stuff, but my use was at the same level as when I wasn't a medical patient, if not more frequent. During this time I consider myself to have been a moderate functioning addict. I got my schoolwork done but I did the bare minimum so i could focus more of my time on smoking and distracting myself with video games and TV. I had been in therapy during this time and the sole focus my therapist had was on my usage. This angered me, as I felt she wouldn't let me talk about anything else. I ended up digging myself deeper almost to spite her, to show that I couldn't handle myself. I couldn't. A couple of weeks after I told her I didn't want to see her anymore I came to the decision on my own that my usage was out of control, and that I couldn't stop smoking even when I didn't want to. It was a compulsion, and I sacrificed so much time and energy on where and when and how to smoke that it was basically all I thought about. I would be high crying my eyes out because I wanted to stop but I couldn't let myself give it up. The turning point was last week when I went down to visit my mom and worked as a delivery driver for one of the apps. On the way down I started bawling crying. All I wanted to do was smoke and smoke, I was afraid i would be so distracted that I would get into an accident. I sat down with my mom and I accepted it for the first time: I have an addiction. 

Today is day 8 of being sober and I've been dealing with it pretty well I think. The withdrawal has been tough but my sleep is much better and I stopped munching so I feel much healthier. I can see myself being on this page much more often, as I've never really had a support group for this. In my mind, I get angry at myself. Why can all of my friends use responsibly but I can't? Then it hit me, I only have one friend who uses frequently who is actually doing something with their life: my best friend who I went to Amsterdam with. Everyone else was completely stagnant and showed no signs of any progression in life. My mom had warned me about this. She told me her friends who were heavy users in adulthood became content with the bare minimum and they didn't end up doing much with themselves. I'm going to school to be an educator, and I want to be a good role model for my future students. My biggest anxiety comes from having to live the rest of my life on guard. I want so bad to say to myself that isn't ""goodbye"" it's ""see you later,"" but I know I'll never recover if I keep taking ""breaks,"" because deep in my heart during all those breaks the only thing that got me through was knowing that as soon as it was over I would go right back smoking. I want so bad to say that maybe when I'm much older I will be able to handle it again. I can't say that. If it's the truth that maybe one day in my far future that will happen I can't live my whole life to get to that point, and I certainly will never be able to control myself later in life if I can't control myself enough to not think to 20-30 years in the future as a time when I can go back. I want to stop, and I don't want to think of this as just another break. 

TL;DR HI everyone! Nice to meet you! I hope to help support you as you help support me!",9

So I have been trying to quit weed for a while now, it always goes pretty good for a time before I go back to my old ways. Individually, quitting is not so hard for me. The problem comes when my housemates offer me a joint. I could go outside with the thought that I will not take a puff and just sit there for good times, but the moment they offer me the joint I am down. Does anyone have any experience with this problem and knows what i should do to just say ""no""?",1

When I smoke too much weed, I can see, how fucked up I am and I promise myself that when I get sober I won't be that way. But when I am sober for few weeks or more, I start to enjoy my not giving a shit attitude and I just choose not to be aggressive towards people I care about.
But I still don't have a problem with behaving like total psychopath, when I need to and doing plenty of things people consider immoral. 
Also when I am sober for few months I am becoming narcissistic, aware of that, but still this way. I am also becoming really confident and too sure of myself, almost to the Point of dellusion.
I know how to use people to get what I want.
I Kind of enjoy being this way.

After I give up smoking I am thinking I want to be guided by love, but after being sober for some time I easily forget about it. 

It is like weed makes feel more human, If that makes sense.

On my day 28 today, doing crazy shit, doing some a little immoral stuff and feeling like at the top of the world.

The longest I've been sober was 4 months and I was just more and more like that.

Can anybody relate?",1

2020-07-03 07:57:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkhs4q/i_finally_made_it/,I finally made it,"Two years ago I frequented this sub (with a different account) because I desperately needed to get sober and cut this nasty habit from my life once and for all, because it slowly ate away my soul. Back then I had been heavily addicted for about 10 years. The first three years I started smoking more and more until I was high more days of a year than I was not, and the 7 years after I was basically high all day every day. I was smoking away my life, I lost myself completely. The last few months before I decided to quit for good I realized that I don't know who I am anymore. Like I couldn't tell what part of me and my personality was my true self and what was just the drug inside my delusional brain. I got very close to a permanent drug induced psychosis and started to get increasingly paranoid and schizotypal. I've tried to get away from it many times over the course of 18 months, throwing away my stash and grinder, smashing my utilities. After trying to scrape the thrown away stuff out of the trash and ashtray in desperate cravings I started to soak it. Just to run back to my dealer the next day. After repeating this cycle of relapsing, hating myself, trying to get rid of it and relapsing again over and over again I hit rock bottom. But everytime I got sober, all this emotional and psychological baggage kept flooding my consciousness and I tried to escape again. I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't even enjoy it anymore, I was a desperate mess of a junky with a lot of unsolved and suppressed issues from which I tried to hide.

That was when I discovered this sub. And for one final time I soaked the rest of my stash. This time was different. I bit through the first days and when the brain fog finally started to clear I felt like I could breathe fresh air for the first time in a decade. Whenever I got weak, I came to this sub and read about all the people who are in the same boat as me and all the motivational posts really helped me keeping it up. This probably saved me. For the first time in a very long time I stayed sober for more than just a few days and most importantly I stopped counting time until I could smoke again. After hitting three months I knew that I couldn't return to where I came from. I finally managed to keep up my resolve and accepted the fucked up mess I've been those past years instead of sugarcoating my drug habit so I could always go back to hiding from myself when I got confronted with parts of me that I didn't like or understand. And it worked. I started running as a hobby, I picked a part time job, I went back to university and finally took my studies seriously, I cut away old toxic relationships with some of my stoner buddies. 

But I would lie if I said that I didn't smoke ever again. After about 6 months I got weak. It was at a party when I felt like I was in control of myself enough to try and take a hit without fully relapsing. And I even enjoyed it in a way I couldn't anymore in those terrible months before I quit. I tried not get seduced by my inner demons and didn't smoke for another two months after that. But then I thought that if I could manage to just take a hit every now and then when I'm with people, it might be ok. As long as I don't sit on a mountain of weed on my own, not leaving the house for days, right? But that didn't work out. As soon as I could handle casual smoking now and then, my resolve started crumble. And after a few weeks I was back on the couch of my dealer. Fair enough, I didn't smoke as much and as often as I did in the years before. But I started to smoke regularly again. Even if it was one joint every other night, it still was on a regular basis. And before I knew it, I had to restrain myself from smoking all the time, and every time I did it, I enjoyed it less. Falling back into my hazy state of confusion, delusion and paranoia. 

But still, this time it was different. I couldn't fall back into the old habits again completely. I feel like that having made it those first six months before put something like a fail-safe into my subconscious, keeping me from falling too deep. As soon as I smoked two days in a row, I started to get paranoid and schizotypal again, and this gradually kept me from wanting it too much. I don't know if it was the paranoia or the fact that I made through those six months before, but it kept me from relapsing completely. The last time I bought some it was like 2 grams on which I sat for almost three months, only smoking once or twice a week. And I only enjoyed like half a trip of all the times I smoked some of it. And before I ran out, I got so sick of having it around that I didn't even want to smoke anymore. So I tossed it away. 

And that was now exactly one year ago. I didn't even force myself to stop smoking. I just stopped wanting to smoke. About a month after I tossed away that rest, I finished my masters degree and stopped smoking cigarettes and drinking too. And the more my body recovered from all the shit I did to it over the last 10 years, the less I felt the need to do any of it again. A short while after I realized that this time I finally quit without forcing myself to, I decided to see a therapist. And this helped me stay on track. I didn't relapse again. I got diagnosed with aspergers and finally had the courage to come out to myself as trans - which was the biggest part of me I kept hiding from by smoking myself into a coma. I finally cut out every single one of the people I used to smoke and drink with after my first try to get away from it. I started to work through all the suppressed mess I kept running from and it gets better every month. I lost weight, started eating healthy and picked up running regularly again. And now I've been sober for a full year without I even realizing it's been this much time already. I didn't have to count days this time around. And for the first time I'm convinced that I finally made it. I will never touch weed again, because I don't need it anymore.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to visit this place one last time, because it was very important to me when I started out on this journey. And I wanted to say, that you can do it. Even if you think you failed. Just don't forget that sometimes failure is part of the process, so long as you don't give up on that goal of getting through it once and for all in the end. When I relapsed again after making it through the first six months back then, I thought I'd failed again. Just to realize that I couldn't fall as deep as I did before. And that getting back up wasn't as hard anymore. And that contributed to finally making it after all.",47
2020-07-03 07:39:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkhka4/day_3_of_the_no_joint_july_journey/,Day 3 of The No Joint July Journey,"One year ago, was the afternoon I smoked weed for the first time, whilst being out with a friend of mine. We were sitting in a park and a group of guys, that knew my friend (as they had come up to her to joke around) were smoking a joint. I asked my friend to call them over so that I could have a pull. I though it would be cool, as I had smoked cigarettes before and that it would be just a one off thing. Little did I know that, it would change my life forever. 

One thing that I can admit is that weed has got me into a lot of situations and states of mind. Both good (such as smoking at friends’ houses and coming to realisations due to paranoia) and bad (only meeting with friends to smoke weed, smoking weed in my high school’s bathroom and being looked at weirdly for smelling of the stuff) 

Weed got me hanging out with people who didn’t care about my mental health, people who would use me senselessly, and people who would say I smoked too much and then offer me a joint.  

Luckily, there was still a part of me that knew I was lost but I couldn’t find myself. I was too lazy. 

But that wasn’t the main reason why I’m trying to quit. 

I’m trying to quit because I don’t want to morph into my main supplier: My Mother. She smokes a lot of weed and at a more often pace too. Fatter joints than I did as well. And you know what that means, more money down the drain. She’s my main financial provider and it hurt to see her waste hundreds of £s a month on it. She would get it on tic often too (If you don’t know, that means to get a certain amount and then pay for it later) I know that she wouldn’t be behind on certain payments if it wasn’t for weed. 

She reeks of it and it was embarrassing walking in the supermarket with her as you could smell her from meters away. 

The other day, she criticised me for smelling ‘sweaty’. I told her that she smells of weed all the time. Then she responded ‘I’d rather smell of weed all the time than of sweat’. 

I just hope I keep strong throughout the month, I can’t afford to relapse.",1

2020-07-03 04:43:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkfk3s/trying_to_fix_too_much_at_once/,Trying to fix too much at once?,"So I've hit a bit of a wall and need some advice/opinions.

I'm into self development in a big way. I have LOTS of things I want to change about myself and my lifestyle. These are my current main goals:
1. Quit weed (by means of cutting down slowly until I've stopped)
2. Achieve my body goals (i.e. lose fat)
3. Have good cardiovascular fitness
4. Stick to a robust daily self - care practice. 

(For context I've been smoking daily for 6 years now). I used to try to quit weed cold turkey. Longest I lasted was 2 months. I've done this a million times and it's never worked. So I changed tactics and tried to cut down slowly instead. I've been cutting down slowly for the last 3 weeks. However, the last 3 days my motivation has disappeared...

I've read somewhere that people should focus on one goal at a time. My perfectionism doesn't like this... And I'm desperately unhappy with my lifestyle the way it is now. And myself. I want to change it now. But I'm starting to think I'm focused on too many goals at the same time and it's splitting my energy. I've been tracking my calories, workouts, times I'm smoking, daily step count etc on a habit tracker app. Is this too much? 

If I had to choose one goal to focus on now it would be quitting weed. I just want it out of my life. I feel like the other goals would be so much easier to achieve without weed in my life. 

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? And what worked for you? Cutting back slowly or going cold turkey? Focusing on one goal at a time? Or implementing lots of little changes? 


Thank you for reading. And any advice is appreciated.",4
2020-07-03 03:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkepps/i_didnt_buy_weed_today/,I didn’t buy weed today,"I just turned 21 yesterday, so for the last 7 years I have been smoking marijuana regularly, and for the last 4 years I haven’t been able to go more than 24 hours without smoking.

I don’t smoke copious amounts, just a bowl once or twice a day. I have Crohn’s disease and it helps bring back my appetite, alleviate inflammation, and generally helps me when it comes out of remission. It sucks because it genuinely helps me with my disease, which makes it even harder to even begin fighting my dependence.

And my dependence is just that. I spend hundreds of dollars on weed every year (and I am a very poor college student.) because I have no control. I must always have it, and when I begin running low, I hit my man for another 1/2 ounce. 

When I don’t have it I go crazy. My anxiety flares to it’s worst places. I panic over everything. My life plan feels hopeless, the tasks I need to complete seem impossible, the consequences to failing feel like they’ll be the literal end of the world. I can’t relax. I can’t focus. I can’t enjoy the things I like to do when I’m high (which is everything.) Suicidal thoughts sometimes come in common as thinking about the weather. It has nothing to do with the high either. I can be high as fuck, but the second I finish my last bud the panic sets in untill ive worked out with my dealer what time I’m picking up the next day.

There’s physical effects on my body as well. I stop eating almost completely as my appetite is gone. For example, when I travel with friends outside the country I lose weight like crazy because I physically can’t eat while I don’t have access to marijuana. My friends (who are coincidentally non-smokers) literally make it a priority to figure out how to safely get their sick friend weed any time we travel then plan around finding places where I can smoke so I can actually eat around every meal. It makes me feel like a huge burden to them. On a different trip to the Middle East it was even harder and more dangerous to find, and my weight dropped over thirty pounds while I was there. My doctor was immensely alarmed but just chalked it up to heat and an exit from remission rather than the more serious problem that I have- not that I’ve discussed it with her.

I want to quit so bad. I have law school coming up after my final year in college and beyond that the world. I’m tired of this shackle holding me down where ever I go. 

Two days ago I realized that I was running out. But rather than immediately dropping another 90 on a 1/2 ounce, I decided I would wait until the next day. 

Yesterday something within me told me that I could do this. And I was able to resist texting my dealer and forced myself to eat lightly.

Today I kept myself busy with work and studying for the LSAT, but in the back of my mind the urge and panic remained, gnawing at me. I felt like I KNEW I was going to break down when I was home for the night and go buy again. 

But I didn’t. It’s now 3am and I’m resisting the urge to get my pipe and do a resin hit. I know that I have a long, long way to go and I don’t know if I can ever have a casual relationship with weed or if I need to cut it out completely. I also don’t know that I’m strong enough to keep this up.

But for the first time in years: I didn’t buy weed today.",293

Going on solo trips for the first time, always going to concerts, trying new restaurants, doing things out of my comfort zone. 

    Now I feel so incredibly bored and trapped. I work from home, and I feel so bored and stuck. The few times i get out of the house, it’s either to go to the store (If it’s a “fun” shopping trip like to an antique store or goodwill I just end up buying things I don’t need and then feeling guilty. My spending and binge eating has definitely increased, since I can’t do what I actually want to) or to go on a hike or to a park. That’s it. Im going insane and I need a release so badly. know smoking pot will make me feel good, it’ll give me euphoria and I’ll get crazy high since I haven’t smoked in a year. 


    I know I don’t actually want to smoke or drink, but I’m so tired of feeling bad all the time. I’m so lonely and empty and I just want to DO something.

I was doing really well about reading, writing, doing more yoga, and taking care of myself in general, but it’s so hard to see the point. 

    I feel so alone and tired, and I wish anyone understood.

I’m just a random person and I’m upset. 

Back to weed, so I feel like shit physically, I’m irritable and bummed out. If I get weed tonight I would start over my recovery and I need to get through this first stage where I feel like crap.

I actually had to go to a treatment center to quit. Smoked all day, every day for the past 15 years. It started out recreational, but it soon became self-medication for my anxiety/depression. Toward the end it started to have a counter effect to my mental health. It just made everything worse.

 In treatment I learned that I could find happiness in sobriety, yet also had reservations that I may not be an addict. Maybe I just didn’t know that I could feel serene in sobriety.

Long story short— I broke up with my girlfriend of 10 years about 10 days ago. I just got home from a dispensary. Picked up a dimebag to smoke one bowl and was planning on flushing the rest. Part of me feels like I can do it just this time, or perhaps periodically now that I know I can be alright sober (some days). 

Today I can’t cope. I have attachment issues, and we had a mutual codependency. She says she loves me but she’s still not ready to be with me. (We’ve been on the rocks for almost 2 years) 

Part of me thinks I can smoke it periodically now that I’ve abstained for this duration, yet the other part of me is scared I will slip back into addiction.

My wife and I got home from a day trip and my daughter said something that set my wife off right when we got home.

I was really frustrated and went outside to do some yardwork and kept thinking about relapsing.  I told myself, hey relapsing won't fix this.  I recognized that I wanted to use to forget about the pain of the current situation. 

So I called my sister, a trusted ally.  She gave me some support and my urge to wreck my sober streak dissolved. I also recognized and used HALT.  I am tired and hungry and that contributed to my overreaction.  

My daughter came into my room later and asked if I was mad.  I said no, I'm fine, which is true thanks to listening to my sister.  We talked for a few minutes and everything is good again.

This is by far the longest I've gone without weed since starting at 15( 8 years ago), and sure it's really nice that I've quit and it's something I'm proud of, but I'm pretty upset at myself for my inability to follow through on the pretty realistic and modest goals I've set for myself.

I think I'm passionate about music, but I don't accomplish my goals for music (I'm way more productive now, but still not that productive relatively speaking). I think I value exercise/fitness, but I've completely failed to meet any goals in that respect and have been really lazy and inconsistent. Since I'm out of school and out of a job I figure I'd set a reading schedule and read everything I've been recommended/wanted to read in terms of self-help. I'm incredibly behind on that and again, I'm inconsistent and lazy about it. I've spent the last two months breaking my goals down into smaller goals, barely achieving those/failing to achieve them, get angry at myself and give it another try with small goals and fail again. Rinse and repeat.

I've spent most of my days sort of half-assing through my tasks/goals, interspersed with long periods of Reddit surfing/gaming/porn/whatever other distracting or escapist sort of behaviour I feel like doing at that time. After realizing how little I've done that day, I get discouraged and pissed off and scrape by, doing the bare minimum. I already see a therapist and complain about this week in and week out and I feel like I haven't made much of an improvement. I know I'm not disciplined and am lazy, and I know the answer is that there's nothing to it but to do it, yet still I don't do what I've set to do. I've made a schedule. I've written my goals down. I have a to-do list. Yet I still don't do anywhere near enough. It's like I don't give a shit, but I really do!

I don't know if I just don't care/am not really passionate about what I think I'm passionate about, weed has permanently fucked my brain up, or I've always been an underachieving and lazy bastard and am doomed to such a fate. I'd like to think I'm a fairly intelligent person that's ambitious, but if this is my best showing despite me having goals and wanting to achieve them but consistently failing, then I honestly just would rather get a job as a garbage man or something brainless I hate that's decent-paying and go back to smoking weed and doing dick all. If I could just accept I've ruined my life in a sense, and just accepted going back to weed, maybe I wouldn't feel all this dissonance.

I've obviously fucked up in the past and underachieved majorly (graduated uni 2 years late with a liberal arts degree and a pretty bad 3.2 GPA which kind of makes my options pretty narrow). But, the fact I'm still underachieving and being so lazy makes me pretty cynical about my chances of ever making a ""recovery"" or whatever. Sure I'm getting closer to my goals more than ever, but at this rate I'm not going to accomplish much and still be a mediocre underachiever. I know I probably won't fuck up and smoke this week or whatever, but I'm slowly feeling like this has been a pointless endeavour. I still won't achieve my goals at this rate. I still haven't made any friends. I still am lazy and unproductive and absolutely loathe that. So why even bother?

It seems like quitting and getting one's shit together has been a successful endeavour for people on this subreddit, and to them, I say that's awesome and congratulations. And to people who haven't quit/are only on day 7 or something, I say that it's almost definitely worth it. But it seems like I've been left in the dust and it sucks. I want to give up, but I can't.",2

So I asked my sister for help, gave her my stash and asked her to put everything under lock and key (she also smokes recreationaly) so I would'nt even be tempted.

Hey Leaves! I’ve been lurking this incredibly impactful and supportive community page for a few days now and I think it’s finally time to make my contribution to the greater good by sharing my experience. Please feel free to reach out to me directly as I have been so touched by many of the posts I’ve stumbled across here and I feel obligated to help/impact others in any way that I can. 

Just for a bit of background: I spent my middle school and high school years as a latch-key kid. My mom worked her ass off to give us a good life and for her hard work I am eternally grateful. She worked 12 hour shifts at the hospital from 7am-7pm, and after every shift she would come home extremely irritable and stressed- until she lit that first joint and poured her first glass of wine. Marijuana and alcohol use have been prevalent in my household ever since I can remember- even before my dad left us and I’m fairly certain he lit a huge blunt up as he sped off.

Being home after school from 3pm-7pm when my mom came home presented a lot of opportunity for experimentation. I first tried marijuana when I was 12. I was completely unsupervised.

Around age 15 my mom and I started smoking together. I remember how new I was to getting stoned. Food tasted incredible, jokes were funnier, masturbation felt INCREDIBLE, and nothing really seemed to matter- all of the woes of our family life were numbed. It was just unearned pleasure ALL THE TIME. 

My mom had all of the money so she would give me $20 every day to pick up weed from the dealers at school. I remember it was all I could think about and all that I cared about; securing the bag so we could have that session later, just me and my mom. 
A few years later, around age 17 I began to realize how much of a grip this substance was gaining on my life. I have always been competitive in sports, and my junior and senior years our basketball team won over 30 games and went to state. I was the captain and I was BLOWED the entire time. Our coaches smoked with us on the way to games. We came to school and practice high out of our minds. Every teacher and administrator at our high school knew, but we were in essence celebrities because of our winning and notoriety so we got away with whatever we wanted. Some days we would just straight up walk on and off of campus at will. I can remember being in Hawaii for a tournament and my coaches asking locals for weed on the street the day of our game. Long story short- no responsibility or discipline was imposed here either. They encouraged it.

During this time I was struggling with depression and mental health issues as a result of my dependence on weed. I was suffering from what I now understand to be endless thought loops, lack of concentration, diminished confidence, withdrawal, depression and sexual compulsions which were also related to my then porn addiction. I thought I was really sick in the head, I never blamed the weed.

Having these formative marijuana experiences with the people I looked up to the most (parents/coaches) engrained this false acceptance that marijuana abuse is nothing to worry about. It is harmless. “It’s just a plant!”. These reinforcements by people who had power in my life made me think there was something wrong with me for not wanting to smoke an 8th per day while my brain was still developing. As much as I didn’t want to, I couldn’t stop because I was SO addicted and SO surrounded.

Fast forward to today, I’m creeping up on my 25th birthday and although I’ve made serious attempts at quitting in the past, this is the one. 

I am now a young business professional with a degree and a certificate from an Ivy League school- something I narrowly accomplished while burning up three times a day. I’ve always skated by sheerly on talent or charisma alone, and I’m so tired of achieving the bare minimum as I know I’m capable of so much more. The world is my oyster, if I so choose to conquer this pitfall. Saying this from a place of equal self awareness and humility, I fully realize my potential and in order to manifest the dreams and goals that I have for myself- I know I need to cut it out completely. This is my fight. This is my war. The Leaves community is my ally, and to your quarrels with marijuana addiction, I am yours. Let’s do this thing together!

So here I am, on day 2 of the rest of my life. 

I hope this resonates with some of you out there! We have a choice. We are in control. Let’s do the damn thing!",19

This is probably my 4th time attempting to quit, its mere impossible to quit at home cause Im around it 24/7 so I flew away to my grandparents for the Summer.

Usually I come here for one month, not many people smoke in this country and theres not much happening to get me frustrated so I find it alot easier to avoid... but the second I get home I normally have a joint as a "" reward "" because I went a month without smoking so i deserve one.. right??

Thats how it starts, Ill only have one a night, say to myself Ill smoke like a normal person now, but within a month Im back to my old self, wake and bake everyday and Im stoned until I pass out that night, college dropout twice, no job, no motivation and no direction. My whole life revolves around my next joint and getting high as you probably experienced yourselves.

So this time Ive had enough and so have my family, Im not the same person I used to be and Ill get nowhere if I dont change my lifestyle sometime soon.

Im here for 2 months this time so Im hoping when I get back I wont be as tempted to smoke, everybody around me is constantly smoking and I dont have any non - stoner friends ( I feel as I drifted from anyone who doesnt smoke cause why would I meet up with someone if we werent getting high?? )

Anyway I know when I get home everyone will be smoking around me again and if I can make it through 2 months with no weed, I dont want to destroy that progress cause Ill hate myself again and Ill really feel hopeless this time.

I know my friends will try pressure me to smoke as they swear weed only has benefits and it cant do no harm, or I cant leave without taking at least a drag off the joint but I just have no self control and Ill bounce back to where I was

Has anyone advice on how to stay strong while a joint is being passed around? Or has anyone quit and kept hanging out with stoner friends and not relapsed?

Just reading other people’s similar experiences have helped me a lot during rough times, so thank you peeps in this sub for existing!


So like many other stories on here i was smoking every day for about ten years. It became a habit that in the latter was more or less destructive. The thing is, like many other drugs, weed enhances the feeling you had before you smoke.

In my case those feelings more or less became anxiety, mostly because of all the time i felt i had wasted. Still i wanted to smoke! Yet every time i did it, it yet again, enhanced my negative feelings about smoking. A downward spiral out of control!

Truth is during those ten years i tried a lot of other drugs as well. I’m grateful non of them got the hold of me the same way as weed. It could have been a lot worse.

Now 23 weeks later I’m exercising 5days a week, have a descent income and actually manage to save some of my salary . The first time this lifetime i’m not living paycheck to paycheck! 

Right now i feel like i’ve changed the difficulty in a video game from expert to easy. Is been a bumpy road though, the first few weeks was hell but it all became clearer and clearer.

Somewhere along the line I realized it will come to a point where the thought of being stoned wont be attractive at all. To be honest right now i don’t miss it one bit and haven’t for at least 3-4months. I’m very hopeful that this thought pattern will last and am happy to say that I’m not attracted to mary jane any more!

Thank you for reading and i wish u all a good leave",7

The first 10 days was hell I cried all the time, I was depressed, tense and just a nightmare to be around. After than things got easier I started doing things again, I still felt pretty crappy but the cravings subsided. I had rekindled my love for non-smoke related hobbies. I was making music, running, reading and baking treats. 

Then things got hard and I relapsed I thought it would be just that one weekend but 2 months later I’ve un done all that progress. All I want to do is lie in bed and cry, I’m constantly filled with self loathing, I’ve lost interest in most of hobbies and the few hobbies I’m still into I constantly beat myself up for being shit at them or not doing them enough. I’ve almost completely lost interest in living my life outside of where is my next smoke coming from.


I know I need to quit again because I’m slowly destroying myself mentally and financially but I’m scared of what an insufferable demon I’ll be during the first few days. I’m currently seeing a therapist for a lot of my issues and it helped before but now I feel like I’m just going through the motions and checking boxes. 

I feel very much at the end of my rope. I’m worried that I’ve lost myself to weed and may never get back, but sometimes I wonder if there was anyone really there in the first place and not just a shell, trying to fill the vacant space where self love should be. I’m scared because only when I quit smoking so I realise how truly miserable I am all the time and I don’t know if I can live like that.",6
2020-07-02 04:37:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hjtcut/2_weeks_pretty_stoked/,2 weeks - pretty stoked,"Hi everyone I hope you're all taking care of yourselves.

I'm pretty stoked that today is 2 weeks. I've had a daily habit for over 16 years and this is probably the longest I've gone without in that time. This is definitely the longest I've gone willingly. The first week was brutal from day 2 until like day 6. I could not muster the motivation to do anything. I didn't even want to eat. Well the past week has been much better.

Usually I would need 5 or 6 strong coffees throughout the day just to keep me semi alert and I would not get out of bed in the morning until the very last minute. Everything was a struggle and even basic things like my hygiene were not at an acceptable standard. Now I have 2 coffees maximum and I don't really feel like I need both - I just enjoy coffee (the first one helps though). I've been getting up earlier to go for a walk to build up a sweat before work.

My eating has been steadily normalizing but it has been difficult for me to gauge how much I can eat when I'm sober. I've been making myself the size of meals that I can devour when I'm high but it's just way too much food when I'm not. The meals are spread throughout the day better too, rather than not eating much in the morning and afternoon and just eating loads at night. My fitness is improving. I'm still very out of shape but the weight is already dropping slowly and I don't feel out of breath as fast.

It's still very early in to this and I know I have a long way to go but the progress I've already seen has shown me a better way. I've been really lucky that I've not experienced many cravings. I occasionally think that a joint would be nice but try to quickly remind myself it won't be nice. I'll sit around feeling anxious and just won't make any progress that day. Sleeping hasn't been an issue at all - I've been so exhausted at the end of the day that I've been able to get straight to sleep.

I've been really enjoying coming here reading the progress from people with many weeks/months under their belts and hearing the positive changes it has brought to their lives. So thanks very much for sharing that progress and I hope that I can continue with this and hopefully provide a bit of inspiration for others.",4
2020-07-02 03:43:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hjsrg1/okay_dont/,"""Okay, don't.""","I'm trying to have a baby using a sperm donor. After years of waiting for the right time, then months of waiting for my body to be able to carry, then weeks of waiting for an appointment... I'm finally starting the process. It's been an incredibly stressful wait, so I was smoking constantly because I didn't think there was anything wrong with it. I tried to stop a few times, but never got past two weeks. I just didn't have the motivation. 

During my first conversation with the doctor, she was asking me the usual questions.
""Do you smoke cigarettes?""
""No.""
""Do you drink alcohol?""
""No."" 
Do you smoke marijuana?"" 
I took a second, weighing my addiction against my future. ""Yeah, quite a bit.""
""Okay, don't."" 

Those two words had more power in them than anything I've ever told myself. She explained that it there isn't a lot of research into it due to legality, but it would likely affect fertility and my chances of conceiving and with that I was done. Completely. Full stop. I still had my vape with some brand new cartridges, a few joints - one was wrapped in rose petals - but those two words stopped me in my tracks. I finally had a reason to stop. I know it's wrong to only rely on outside sources for motivation to stop, but I needed someone else to tell me. 

I still have the desire somewhat, but it's not worth it if it's going to hurt my baby. A temporary stop to boredom isn't worth the chance that I won't be able to have a family. It took me years, but I'm saying goodbye to weed. Hasta la vista, baby.",8

Not out of the woods, but liking who I am becoming.","I'm a bartender and have been and om and off pretty heavy smoker for 15 years. Bongs, edibles, vapes, I loved them all. I've had stints of quitting as long as 3  months but breakups and job issues would lead me back to the green monster. 

As the beginning of lockdown I bought a sizable quantity for cheap. I rolled 45 plus joints and buried my head in the sand. Without work I was a breakfast lunch and dinner smoker. I would pass out every night stoned and filled with takeout and crap. I also loved mini cigars, Colts being my favorite. I would mix tobacco with weed and then smoke another cigar and more weed.  The cycle was vicious. 

I live alone and my apt allows smoking. I'm in Canada and weed is legal. A txt message can get me weed delivered in a matter of an hour, usually less because I would tip and pay cash all the time. I was snippy at work, always excited to get home and smoke a J, or worse have one rolled up and sparking as I was leaving. 

Started getting anxiety and nervousness. I never had before but I felt my body was telling me something. 

When my job brought back a handful of employees I was hurt not to be one of them. But deep down I knew. I wasn't an asshole, I was productive and worked hard but sometimes they would get a squinty unconfident bartender.  They knew. And I know now. I went up to a cottage with two buddies about two weeks ago. Mushrooms, weed and cigars were flowing and all we did was smoke and trip. I spent the day emotional and pissed off. I piled on and when I got home I had a few joints left, already thinking of making the call for a delivery.  

But then as I looked at my last joints I realized. These were my last joints. I could do what I had before, quit smoking weed and replace the fix with cigars. So I decided to quit cigars first. I did replace that with a non weed non tobacco low nicotine vape (1.6%) and after a day or so I was feeling the craving for tobacco go away. 
I'm an avid audiobook reader and walker. I started purposely leaving my debit card at home so I wouldn't be tempted to buy tobacco on the walk or worse an expensive pre rolled joint from one of the many legal dispensaries on the way. 

Looking at the joints I made a quit plan. 6 joints, 4 days. Instead of two or three it was a half in the day and a full at night. But the anxiety and paranoia was there.  I challenged myself by sticking to just half a joint a night. I also decided to get up whenever I woke up instead of going back to sleep and lounging around all day. Not smoking during the day made the night half joint hit me hard and more anxiety and paranoia. I looked forward to quitting but had to remind myself that I always wanted to quit when I was high. So why didn't I?  Sleep.  That's why, I convinced myself I needed it. 
My last night with a half joint turned into my second last night as I decided to have one puff and keep a the 1/4 joint for my an extra night.  I figured it was better then buying more.  I spent the day walking and trying to tire myself out. I also had to fight myself from day napping.

I had the last 1/4 j and had a tough sleep, but I slept. I woke up after maybe 4 hours of sleep. But I thought, this is good, I'm going to take a walk and not nap and stay up late and see what happens if I can even sleep. I'm not a drinker but I had one glass of wine to calm a bit. And sleep was better. I woke up and all of a sudden I was a day down. Could I go two days?  And could I not use tobacco as a crutch. I challenged myself. 
I also spent a few bucks on some melatonin and valeryan root to help sleep. I bought 'Tranquili'tea' a herbal blend with peppermint and other herbs.  Sleep started getting even better. Suddenly between walks, keeping my apartment clean and listening to books while walking and reading one while falling asleep I didn't miss it. I was breathing better. My face looked leaner and my smile was more natural. My cravings for junk and takeout faded. 

It's been 8 days. I'm not out of the woods yet but now I sleep deeply and soundly though I am worried I may fall back onto my habits. 

I've put put a ton of resumes. If I don't get called back I'm looking at it as an opportunity to get two new jobs. I'm sick of having a crappy car. I'm sick of how much per month I was spending on tobacco and weed. I've decided to use quitting as a weapon. Usually if a girl doesnt smoke weed I wont date her, but why?  Now I'm looking for the right girl and I feel the confidence to find her.  A non smoker.   

The sleep aids help but I'm now not having to use them every night. I fall asleep with a book in my hand. I've made a budget without weed. I want a new car. I want to build a PC. I want nice things and a good life, not to pretend I have nice things by escaping reality and watching tv. 

It isn't easy but it is getting easier. I've said goodbye to my weed friends until the point I can hang out with them somewhere neutral where I won't want to smoke weed. And I can honestly say I don't  want to smoke weed. 

I don't look at the years of smoking as a loss, I just look at it as if I've cashed in my future lazy days and spent them in the past. 

I felt I was too far gone, passed the point of no return. But the pit of darkness isn't perpetual. Starting with small goals made them all attainable. I've started writing again. I changed my appearance by growing a beard which I think compliments my now thinner face. I've got the confidence to wear my now medium length hair in a different way. I'm looking ahead and visualize myself in a new job with a new smile meeting that special someone and having the confidence to go for it and form a relationship with someone special. I love the idea that I didn't quit weed, that I broke up with it. The affair is over. 

Will I ever smoke again?  Maybe and probably will slip but I'm setting up for the future. 

I want more and it's looking bright and positive. I can do this and it's been hard, but not as hard as I built it up in my mind. If I can do it you can too. 
You're never too far gone. You have it in you; you have that person in you who never smoked weed before and you can meet them again. You can save yourself. The first day is the hardest. The keeping non complacent is your friend. Strive for better.  Trying to and even 'successfully' smoking and being productive just adds more stress and wastes energy. 

If you have a set back in life instead of saying 'I'm going to get high and forget my problems' look at it as 'I'm not going to get high, at least thats one less problem.'

Non smokers will notice. Only good things can happen breaking up with weed. 
Health, more money and a clear head are virtually automatic side effects of breaking up with weed. Your weed mistress will slowly return the things it took and if it doesn't, look at it as a new chance and a new beginning. And keep on this sub-reddit. 

You got this. You have inner strength.",6

I developed tinnitus (mild but noticeable) in one ear about 13 days into quitting, it spread to the other but I kept telling myself it will go away. And it did after about a week!

Fast forward to about 5 days ago and i noticed it came back! This kinda sent me spiraling into anxiety. It's on and off but I just keep telling myself it'll stop and i pray it does.

 I also started noticing quite a few more floaters in my right eye and this kinda freaked me out, with my initial reaction being ""IM GOING BLIND."" I also have some weird visual things happening in my periphery, like little lights that happen sometimes.

I know this is probably just my brain resetting after about 2 years of smoking every single day, but I can't talk about this shit to my family bc they don't know how much I was smoking. So honestly I could use some support/reassurance, the health anxiety is only exacerbated by the raging pandemic.

To end on a positive note though, I don't even have cravings anymore! Probably bc im so freaked out lol. Staying strong but just a bit spooked. And a tip to anyone that might be going through the same, save yourself the panic and stop googling every single symptom you have (i'm very guilty of this).",4

Today I went back to work for a meeting post-quarantine, so we could start outlining how work will be like while the virus is still out. I saw some of my coworkers again & talked to a bunch of them, it was pretty nice. Saw a few of my friends today as well, & that was also pretty good.

I’ve not really had a good reason to quit before, altho I’ve turned the idea in my head a few times, was even here on leaves a few months ago, got about 4 days under my belt but then had a panic attack bc of quitting a job and went back to smoking. But, the stresses are gone, the tumultuous startup of the coding bootcamp has smoothed out. I don’t foresee any big stressors coming along in the next month or so, and I’ve finally got a good reason to quit. I’m going to miss my evenings with it and will have to find something different to replace the mental relief I get from it. I’m thinking meditation. Combined with dancing to shake off the day and maybe a little yoga as well. We’ll see how it goes. 

But for today, for tonight, I can manage not smoking. I’m just going to take it one day at a time. And I’m hoping as I get it out of my system, this coding stuff will start to make sense when I’m doing it myself.

2020-07-01 17:07:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hjj49g/day_2_after_legalization_and_lockdown_started_to/,Day 2 after legalization and lockdown started to lead to a loss of control.,"I started smoking weed about four years ago after I switched careers and ended up going back to college. Initially I started off pretty tame. I was living back home as I went to the local Community College to get my gen eds finished which involved me driving to class everyday and I refuse to drive under the influence, so I was generally limited myself to waiting until after my Mom went to bed to light up which usually entailed one or two bowls out of the bubbler pipe my brother got me, listening to some music for an hour or two, and going to bed. An eighth would last a few weeks.

A couple years go by and I finish up my associates degree and move to a four-year university that is a few hours away to work on my bachelor's. I'm not the most social person in the world, so I stuck with the plug that I had previously which still kept me pretty limited on the amount that I could get. Plus, he was starting to get into some heavier stuff a bit over a year ago which was making him stupidly unreliable so there were times were I would go anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months without anything. But, when I did have some it started to creep from ""just before bed"" to ""when I'm finished with all my work"", and an eighth would last about a week.

And then recreational weed became legal in my state. Initially demand far outpaced supply and it was still hard for some time to find stuff whenever you wanted and long lines meant standing for hours in the cold, but it was far more available to me than it was before, and involved a 5 minute drive each way to pick some up rather than 3-4 hours each way. That's when it started to slip a bit out of control. ""When I'm finished with all my work"" started changing to ""When I have a break"". An eighth would last a few days, and by this point I stopped doing most of my hobbies.

The lockdown started in March. All the long lines at the dispensary? Gone. They quickly switched to online orders only taking that wait time from a few hours at most to a few minutes at the least. Being cooped up in my apartment all day with easily accessible weed and probably partly due to stress of general life right now meant ""When I have a break"" changed stupidly rapidly to wake and bake, and it remained that way. I started pushing off every ounce of work that I had until the last possible minute and while I was able to pass all my classes in my final semester with decently good grades, because I wanted to spend my day smoking weed and playing video games rather than doing work it was an absolute stressful hell even with weed.

Yesterday was my first fully sober day since January 1st. I'm in the middle of a job search at the moment, and even though weed is legal in my state a company can still rescind an offer if someone pops on a pre-employment drug test, and I'd rather not take that chance. I thought I would be able to stay in control. In six months I went from an eighth a week to a half ounce a week. I went from smoking only before bed to smoking all day, every day. I went from spending maybe $50-100 a month on weed to spending over $700 in June which is totally unsustainable for me. Things were getting out of hand. It really does put your life on hold, and while it makes shitty things more tolerable it completely takes away your initiative to fix them.

I successfully quit smoking cigarettes about a year and a half ago replacing it with a Juul, and I got off that at the beginning of the year. If I can do that I know I can do this, and that means you can too. Keep it up and stay strong.",2

I’ve smoked everyday for 5 years, before lockdown I would smoke before work then when I got home. Thing is, last few months my use skyrocketed into all waking hours.

I play tennis and that’s the only restbite I get from being high (in the last 2 months), and I have to hold myself back smoking 4 hours before (so I don’t embarrass myself!)

I have the motivation to do it now I think, but I don’t want to cause myself undue stress. I’m returning to work in a few weeks and that will organically reduce my usage.

Should I try to quit when I have the distraction of work, do it now or cut down over a month or so and set a date on the calendar?

I also don’t want to loose the motivation, I say I want to quit a lot but the day I run out I can’t help phoning up old matey! Feel a bit more serious about it at the moment.

Never, ever give up.","On October 31st, 2018, I made the firm decision to quit cannabis once and for all. I had tried many, many times in the past, but I somehow felt that this time would be different. It definitely helped that I had two great, supportive friends who were kind enough to help, encourage and guide me on my journey to sobriety. I was thinking of this subreddit today and wanted to say a few words to you all.

I find it heartwarming that people of such a variety of ages, cultures, lifestyles, interests, and situations can each come together and support each other on the journey common to them all. This subreddit was an invaluable resource for me. It really is something to witness others whom you don't even know give you so much encouragement, hope and kindness. Not many people I knew understood the significance of this addiction and how much it was bringing me down. I can't thank you all enough, regardless of whether you were here back then or not. The fact that you're making the effort to take that leap and break free of this addiction is enough. You are all in my heart.

I have such respect for every single one of you. As I mentioned, not many people truly understand the significance and difficulty of this addiction, and so sometimes it can make one feel quite lonely. At least it was that way for me. You have my endless support and admiration. If any of you at any time want to message me about anything at all, whether it's just to chat, to talk about your day, to tell me how your journey's going, or to ask me about my own, it would make me happy. Just know that I'm here for each and every one of you - as each of you are for all others on this wonderful subreddit.

This community is unlike any other I've seen on this website. It is a true display of courtesy, support and compassion. We're all in different places, both physically and mentally, but we all come together with our common goal in mind to help each other get to where we want to be.

It took me over 25 attempts to get over my addiction. My, oh my, though... it is the single best decision I have ever made. This past year in particular has been the best of my life, and I know it wouldn't have been so had I been smoking the way I was before. I had always seen people say that their lives were so much better without it, and I found it difficult to imagine and understand at first. But it is the absolute truth. I'm happier, more motivated, passionate, energetic, and patient; I've got much more time, money, and energy on my hands; I'm where and who I want to be - thanks to the decision I made on the day that I'll never forget.

And so, to each and every one of you out there, I want to tell you that I'm proud of you. Never, ever give up, even it takes you a thousand tries. We're all so lucky to be a part of this incredible community.  It has helped me in endless ways, and I know it does and will continue to for each and every one of you as well. You will look back years from now and thank yourself for breaking free from this habit. Of course, I've still got a ways to go, but I'm in a much better place than I've ever been before.

I send my love to each of you. Let's keep supporting each other on this journey, and become the best possible versions of ourselves that we can be!

You are disappointed and feel weak. However, one of the things that makes it so hard to pick yourself back up after smoking is the feeling of having to start back at day 1 again. I don’t think this is helpful. Even if you make it 100 days and slip up, it’s all part of the same journey. Instead of looking at it as starting ALL OVER, look at it as picking up where you left off. Just moving forward on the same path. There’s room in this process for saying “I’m 1 year clean with a few slips!”. IMPORTANT NOTE: please don’t interpret this as *permission* to have a slip. Just a kinder way to treat yourself IF you slip up. Hope this helps ❤️❤️",26

I’ve been smoking weed almost everyday for about 2 years now. I managed to pass up the green throughout my whole high school life because my parents taught me better. Just around the time of my graduation I became friends with this new friend group and everything went downhill. I’ve been an absolute prisoner to cannabis since i’ve started, I am ridiculously addicted to it. 

It started out as something new and exciting to do and quickly became a way of dealing with my emotions and problems by numbing them like alcohol. I’ve been trying to quit for about a year now and the only thing holding me back at this point is the withdrawals I get. They are so scary to me that every time I start to feel them I run and get weed because I can’t deal with them.

Basically what I experience is what I like to call existential depression. I start to think about death and my mind can’t comprehend it and I freak out. I think things like “I don’t understand this life, we wake up, we do our stuff and we repeat it. It doesn’t make sense” and my anxiety disorder kicks in full swing and I often cry my eyes out because I can’t cop with the reality of it. it’s honestly hard to describe the incredibly powerful emotions I get but they are so scary and dark that I will do absolutely anything to get them out of my head. When I smoke, they completely go away and I feel like my normal self again. I can enjoy life and simply take a walk down the street and think mostly positive thoughts. But when i’m withdrawing, I don’t even know who I am as a person and all these crazy existential thoughts about the universe, God and Death flood my brain. For this reason alone, I can’t seem to stop weed. 

Thanks for reading, i’d love some advice if anybody has it.",7

I started using cannabis out of curiosity. I had friends who had tried it and were very enthusiastic about it, so naturally I wanted to share the same experience. Not everyone that tries weed however ends up where I and many of you ended up. We used weed to numb ourselves, to disassociate from our unfortunate reality. I never even liked weed, now that I look back. Personally, I like to be in a headspace that allows and encourages productivity and rational thinking; as opposed to a headspace that forces you to be unproductive and think emotionally. The rational thinking vs. emotional thinking is definitely one of my favourite benefits of quitting weed. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm 5 days off weed and any other substance. I haven't gotten a good nights rest since I started practicing sobriety and I'm losing weight quickly because of my reduced appetite. That being said, the worst symptom of all is the chronic depression. There are pockets of happiness here and there, especially when spending time with friends, however, the majority of my day is contaminated with depressive and self-harming thoughts. I know I'm not going to act on any of them, but it sucks that my death is the only thing that seems to be on my mind. I've tried methods of distraction, even started writing a screenplay, but I can't seem to be happy like I was before I started smoking. Everyday is a damn struggle. Moreover, my family, who I strongly believe were the sole purpose of my heavy addiction, are fucking killing me. I dealt with them well pre cannabis use, and when introduced to cannabis I started regularly using it to escape them. Now, post cannabis use, I find myself overwhelmed with everything. Withdrawal induced depression does not mix well with me being forced to interact with my family. I cannot leave home, I'm a minor, so I'm pretty much fucked at least for the next couple of weeks the way I see it. How do I ease this pain?

I love being present and in the moment, I love I can eat 3 square meals and snack like a normal person, I’m happy I sleep at a decent time, all through the night and wake up ready to take on the day, I have a better relationship with everyone in my family because I’m actually actively present with them, I love I don’t live in my head and think all day, I got a business partner and started a new business, and my relationship with my boyfriend has seen so much improvement that we’re planning to be married. 

I’m grateful to have overcome the many many symptoms of withdrawal. The dreams have been the second worst symptom because they just won’t stop. The worst symptom by far was the upset digestive system - bloating, nausea, gas, irritable bowel - made eating and weight gain very miserable; then there was the body pain, fog and unbalanced chemicals that took a few weeks to begin to return to a natural state - withdrawal was a total nightmare and even the thought of it scares me so much I don’t think weed would ever be a habit again. 

I didn’t know I could be strong enough to overcome something I thought had such a strong hold over me because I couldn’t just stop. Im grateful to have found that within myself. Thank you to all once again for your kindness and compassion.

Never thought I'd have to get to this point.,"As a youngster, I (27F) was so well behaved I wouldn't even be in the same room as weed. It wasn't until university that I started smoking almost daily with my boyfriend and mates, and got into all manner of other drugs. Well those are all gone, but weed never left. My opinion of it was ""I can take it or leave it"" for a few years, and I guess I just never noticed the transition to ""I need it"" over the past 5 years.

I have decided to quit starting today for the following reasons: I want to save my money, I want to feel like I'm in control and not being controlled, I want to be free to exercise again, and I want to stabilise my mood. I used weed to cope with the sudden loss of my father, but that's not the only reason. I enjoyed it, but it takes more than it gives. 

After reading a few helpful articles around the Web on quitting the plant, I wanted to see what reddit has to offer. I'm really keen to read through all your posts here and get some perspective that I'm not alone in wanting out of this. My partner will still smoke weed, but has already helped me on day 1 to resist temptation, so I am immensely thankful he's got my back. He even said me taking the decision to stop is even helping him want to do it less.

Hopefully I can contribute to this community with some positive news in the coming weeks. It's hard to admit to myself that I'm scared to quit, but I can't do this any longer. I'm ready to have my life back.",23

2020-07-01 13:09:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hjee3i/6_months/,6 months,"It’s been 6 months since New Years Day, so I guess you’ll be seeing a few different posts like this. I hope mine brings a different perspective.

I smoked almost every day for about 5-6 years. I had a few week long or even month long breaks, but usually out of necessity rather than choice. I would go to work/class, come home, and smoke. I was what I considered to be a “high functioning pot head”. I had decent-good grades in college and got good jobs out of college, but I knew that weed was holding me back in so many ways. Regardless, I used my lack of overt failure as evidence that I could maintain my lifestyle. 

As time went on I began to analyze more what weed was doing to me and how it was holding me back. The main problem that weed caused for me was wasting all my time. When I got high, there was a very limited list of things I would want to do for the rest of the day. That included: eating, playing games, watching television. Rarely I would decide to go outside for a walk or similar. I didn’t want to read books, push myself further in hobbies, spend time with friends or family, or in general spend time outside of my room. 

Another issue, caused in part by weed swallowing all my time, was anxiety and reclusion. I was afraid of everything - foggy at all times. I knew what I was doing was actively inhibiting me, which only made my time spent high even more sour. I would get high and wonder why my life was the way it was. Why wasn’t I making new friends? Why don’t I have a girlfriend? Why don’t I experience new things?

So on January 1st I decided to quit cold turkey, with no specific goal in mind. I just had something in me that was undeniable: I knew I needed to stop to see what life would be like without weed.

The first few days were strange. Headaches, dreams about relapsing, spacing out, boredom. But those symptoms were accompanied by a feeling of freedom, ever growing clear-headedness, and control. I could spend my time how I wanted. I could go get lunch with my dad without feeling bad. I could read like I had been wanting to for so long. I was finally able to get on a consistent and productive gym schedule, which was going great until the pandemic. I was more available emotionally for friends and family.

One of the strangest things was not feeling that sense of urgency to get done with whatever my day had to offer to get home and smoke. One of the greatest aspects of weed, to me, is finishing off a long day with a bowl. I would use that time to reflect, and being high always gave me a new (albeit anxious and altered) perspective on the things I was dealing with. That safe place of reflection on and dissolution of the day was my favorite part of being high. But without that refuge to resort to, I was left with boundless other options. I never did make 10 new friends or get a girlfriend in the last 6 months, but I sure did experience new things. First and foremost what I got to experience was a sober life.

The most effective approach for staying clean for me was reading this sub frequently. Reading other people’s experiences and struggles and successes really kept me accountable. For the first several weeks I was quite active (on an old account) and more recently I check posts less frequently but still consistently. 

The other thing I attribute to my success of making it 6 months was not setting a hard deadline. I have done this in the past and I would either fail, or make it to the month mark and fall back to my old habits. Instead I would tell myself: let’s make it to a month and see how I feel. After one month, I felt great and I didn’t want to return to my old self so I kept going. My next big milestone would be 100 days. When I accomplished that I had the thought process of “I’ve made it this far, let’s go for 6 months”. This incremental and flexible approach gave me independence to make the right decision.

My next big decision will be what my next milestone will be. Do I shoot for 200 days? Overall, I find it hard to commit myself to never smoking again. I am very much a “never say never person” and oftentimes I take the approach of revisiting things to see if I still don’t like them. This may be attributed to a lack of self-control, but I have a hard time with finality anyway. But I really don’t want to make a mistake. So for now, I will kick the can down the road, and stay sober :)",12

I hope everyone out there is doing well/better and remember if you feel like shit in the first months or days, is normal.

I was fine for a month after I quit like I was all my life then full blown panic attacks and depressed feeling came. I feel like me not ever experiencing that till that moment, really made it stuck in my brain and made me scared.

Also before I had no problems with caffeine, sugar and alcohol but now I’m extremely sensitive to them. If I have a cup of the weakest coffee and I’m not going to be exercising or hiking ect for the next 3 hours then I’ll get anxiety. Same with sugar, alcohol just makes me feel weird and I can feel the change with even one strong drink. It too eventually makes me anxious and the next day usually feel down or weird. I also feel specially sensitive to stress at times, like it’s too much for my brain and it overreacts.

I wish I had good news but I'm afraid that I relapsed after 9 months off of Weed.

Things had been going really well and after the 3 month mark I wasn't even thinking about smoking anymore. Life looked good and I had a lot to look forward to this year. This all changed when COVID happened.

For the first 2 weeks of the outbreak my anxiety was off the chart, never been higher in my life. Then it happened - my first ever panic attack. I literally collapsed on the floor, my legs felt numb and wobbly, like they had no bones in them. I was paralyzed for 2 hours straight, couldn't even reach or crawl toward a phone for help. After that first attack this started happening every day for another 2 weeks.

I eventually snapped and got Lorazepam from my Dr and was on that for a little while before I found out about benzo withdrawal. Fearing that experience my Dr then put me on Pregabalin and I was on that for about 11 weeks before I discovered the hard way that it is just as bad as benzos to come off of.

I started tapering my Pregabalin and the insomnia has been awful, unbelievable in fact. In desperation I ended up buying some Weed to help me through the initial stages of withdrawal. It has been 10 days now and I have smoked every night except for 1.

After 9 nights of smoking I now have cravings to smoke not only at night but when I'm bored. This seems entirely driven by the Pregabalin withdrawals though as any escape or distraction is a blessing.

What I wish to ask is whether you think I would get Weed withdrawal from this relapse? Sure I have some cravings which I can manage but will the night sweats, insomnia, lack of appetite etc all come back? All in all I have smoked about 4 grams over 9 nights and the THC content is in the high teens.

So like most of you I have been smoking for a while. 

growing up in a bad situation and hanging out with a older crowd got me started early. By the time I made it to college I was smoking every day and only took breaks for short periods when searching for jobs after graduating. 

Somehow my addiction got worse now that I'm in my 30s. I have a good job and have my life together and would consider myself pretty successful but I still drink and smoke every day. 

I went from smoking a bowl to taking dabs a few years back and it got to the point where whenever I had something to do I would have to smoke first. Going to the store, lets smoke about it. Going to work, I gotta smoke. Lunch break at work, I'm going to smoke in my car. 

Now with the pandemic I'm at my worst. I work from home in a pretty stressful environment so I would wake up. take a dab, and then log in and start checking emails. About an hour into the day I would start drinking a glass of wine. by the end of the day I have taken 3 dabs and drank a bunch and I'm ready for a nap (waste of a day). 

I have a weird body type i guess because I am very active and drinking and smoking doesn't affect me much. I think thats why I have continued for so long. I would find myself drinking a 22oz beer in my car and taking a dab before going on a 20 mile long mountain bike ride. I would always have to smoke before my soccer games and would sometimes drink a few beers before soccer as well then go run 10 miles. 

I guess I was just lying to myself... After drinking and smoking every day for the past few years I can still run sub 8 minute miles on my morning runs so I can't be that bad??

Now I'm starting to realize how much its setting me back. my job is stressful and I am wasting my weekends by just smoking and drinking all day long. Im not even a social drinker... I never go out to bars, i just drink and smoke at home alone. As a person who has always had a ton of friends and girlfriends... now I have none. 

I find myself striving for more. I would like to have a family and wife and ascend at my job but it seems like i have put smoking and drinking ahead of everything else. 

On monday I stopped drinking. It has probably been years since I had two consecutive days of no booze. Im not like a hardcore get smashed kind of drunk. I usually just grab a 22oz after work and drink but i feel like my face is aging and I'm getting bags under my eyes. today is day three with no booze and its not that hard.

Smoking is going to be more difficult though. I get angry often and frustrated and when I smoke it seems to melt away. Whenever I don't smoke i get annoyed with family members and can sometimes act like a jerk even though i would consider myself normally overly friendly. Then I would smoke and be like ahhhh, okay much better. 

Another big reason I want to quit is because of my sister. she has been unemployed for 4 years and he husband makes good money so she doesn't have to work. She just drinks and smokes as well and hangs out all day. I am the person who has to source our weed and drive 45 minutes each way to get it and usually pay for most of it even though we split it. we will get $350 worth of wax and she will throw $60 bucks and I will have to pay $290.

Financially it just doesn't make sense for me to pay for all her weed and go through the stress of getting it and possibly getting in trouble when she doesn't help with it at all. 

When I quit she will have to quit as well. I have been cutting back on smoking a lot to prepare to go cold turkey. On monday I stopped smoking before and during work and I seem to be a lot more clear headed in conference calls and other daily activities. 

I have smoked after work the past two days but I ran out yesterday and don't plan on getting more. Hopefully this first week passes and I can get on with living my life.",8

Around December time I woke up one morning with an unusually heavy ganjover, which made me feel very un-alert and slow. I decided not to smoke all that day and strangely it didn’t seem to shake.. I woke up the next morning and still felt like I was in this dream like state. After weeks of panicking went by, worrying why I still felt so strange, I discovered a term called ‘brain fog’. Once I had read up on other people’s stories/symptoms through various websites, one being Reddit, it made me feel a lot more at ease.

I decided that stopping smoking would make a big difference in shaking this frustrating stage of my life that I am going through.

I am still suffering from ‘brain fog’ even after 2 months sober, however I’ve learned to accept it and still managing to get through my day to day life with a smile on my face.

To anyone who’s thinking of quitting or who is in the process of quitting, trust me it does get easier. The first few weeks were torture, it was only until around week 6 the cravings became a lot easier to handle. I can’t lie, I still get the urge to spark one up now, but I know it’s the wrong thing to do at this stage in my life, especially when I have come so far on my journey to becoming sober! 

Big good luck to everyone out there and if you ever feel like sparking one up, take a quick look at r/leaves and you will quickly change your mind!",32

But you gotta do it every day — that's the hard part.","I can't believe it myself. I stopped counting days a while back but to hit this milestone is huge for me. I've been smoking pretty much non-stop for the last 4 years of my life and have tried so many times to quit and never really made it past 2 weeks.

I started smoking when I broke up with my ex, I'd already gained some weight but put on more due to munchies and being a lazy piece of shit. Weed was a beautiful discovery at first which quickly turned into a dependency which brought out anxiety, paranoia and thought loops. I became a shell of who I used to be. I was once very outspoken, high energy and the class clown, always making people laugh but weed took all that away from me. I lost a friend to suicide almost two years ago, someone I had smoked a lot with and it shock me to my core. I smoked more to cope but it just threw me deeper into the hole.

Lockdown was a blessing. I had planned to quit anyways but this gave a unique opportunity. I did substitute it for drinking for a couple of weeks but quickly hit that on the head before that became a problem. I started working out, running, playing football and focusing on my diet. Since the beginning of the year, I've lost almost 30lbs (over 60lbs down from my heaviest) and my physical fitness has sky rocketed. Just yesterday I met up with the girl of my dreams, we went for a walk, kissed and it was honestly incredible. I could never have made that connection whilst being high, I was too in my own head. I haven't been with a woman in all my years of smoking due to be scared and self conscious, that's all gone now!

For anyone struggling, it does get better. The brain fog cleared a month ago and I'm finally remembering who I was before this. I'm more outgoing, I'm socialising more and I'm much happier. My best advice is stop counting days. Tell yourself, ""that's it, I'm done"". Replace your bad habits with good ones, exercise is fantastic, it really clears the head and helps you focus. 

It's crazy to me that I've made it this far and I have no plans of ever going back to it. I tried for years to moderate, but I couldn't . I treat myself now by allowing myself to drink occasionally but even then, I've never been a big fan of drinking so it's easier for me moderate that.

If any has any questions or would like any advice, feel free to comment or message me. I know what it's like to be stuck in that hole and I would love to try and helps others dig their way out.",16

Felt absolutely shitty and woke up crazy nauseous twice during the night. But I made it. 

This might not be a big deal to some but my God these CHS episodes are awful. I've lost 7lbs the past week, and I'm a pretty muscular and athletic guy so it sucks to see my body looking sickly and skinnier. Wish I had quit immediately when the very first bout of morning sickness hit. Only thing keeping me going is knowing that going back to smoking is gonna fuck me up worse and get me into that hypemetic phase.

Never felt like I needed encouragement to get through something before but every episode comes with a wave of ""maybe if I just smoke I'll feel better."" I know it's not true but the thoughts come anyway. 

Here's to hoping I make it through the next few days without harsher symptoms. I hope anyone else going through this is staying strong. This shit fucking sucks.",4

Can’t commit to being a stoner because I don’t wanna live that way . 
Can’t commit to complete abstinence because fuck me life is so boring . 

Can’t commit to relationships because I get bored of people . 

Can’t hold down a job for longer than a few years because repetition makes me wanna kill myself . 

I’ve seen numerous positive changes happen in my life since I’ve quit like every other time be quit but even with all that in mind I still just wanna throw it all away and just watch the fucking world burn . 

Perhaps finding a way to have moderation in life would be the solution . Who knows . It hasn’t worked for me in the past because I’ve always had such an abusive relationship with Mary . Maybe in a few years. 
 
I’ve always been a person of extremes , when I quit Mary I become a health nut living complete sobriety eating healthy , no masterbating. 

When mary comes back into my life I go to the other end of the spectrum and become an overeater, smoker , chronic masterbator . 

Happiness is probably somewhere in the middle , that’s what all the wise old folks say . 

I dunno , in any case I’m not gonna smoke weed and throw it all away because I do like what I’ve built around myself over these past 5 months . But fuck me do I get hella jealous when I smell someone smoking dank on a Sunday evening .",9

2020-07-01 05:10:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hj6sxs/6_months_since_i_quit_my_story/,6 Months Since I Quit: My Story,"First, I want to thank this community. This sub had the advice, support, and solidarity that finally helped me help myself.

Here’s my story: I started smoking in the fall of 2016 after moving to Colorado for school. At the time, it was just a fun once a week thing at most. In the winter, my mom got very sick and passed away with such speed and harshness I had a hard time comprehending what had happened. 

That’s when weed became more than just a habit. Spring semester started and soon I was failing classes, losing interest in everything except weed and video games. Time passed, I started seeing a therapist, and overall was digging myself out of depression. I kept trying to go back to school, with intermittent success, but smoking always became the priority in my life. 

Then I met a girl and everything changed, although not all at once. She was also a smoker and I saw how much it affected her ability to work, to care about school, to be a functioning human being. I was so deeply in love with her and we helped lift each other up but always fell back to smoking heavily. Only this time I recognized the pattern. The last time I smoked was the last day of 2019.  

Change was slow but evident.  I had to build completely new routines and patterns.  Whenever I was tempted to smoke, I would walk my dog or light some incense.  I had to lay ground rules for my girlfriend and tell her she couldn’t smoke if she was around me because it was just too tempting.  When we quarantined together, I saw her working harder and more consistently than ever before on her homework, and I was able to work and cook and clean and hold the house together even while incredibly anxious because of the pandemic. I even found new coping mechanisms such as online yoga and meditation and journaling.  Even through the quarantine and more recently, a period of transition where my girlfriend and I went our separate ways, I haven’t smoked.

I have been tempted, of course, but this sub has helped, as well as looking back on my journey.  If you are thinking of quitting here’s my advice: it needs to be cold turkey.  If, after quitting, you are tempted to buy more, just give it the night. Tell yourself you will buy more tomorrow. And then later. And then maybe next week. Never let that day come. And soon you will realize how much better off you are. Six months in, the cravings are still here, but they are weaker.  Or perhaps I am stronger.

2 weeks out i am calm. i am not shaking and sweating and crippled with anxiety. the state of the world is incredibly stressful and yet... i am coping better than i was when i was high.

1. It took 1 month until I didn't just feel like shit every day. 

2. It took about 3 months for my moods to completely stabilise and for me to learn how to deal with my feelings. (Thought I was going crazy for a bit there! Crying fits, raging over small things and starting to believe I was just a bad person without weed) 

3. It is so fucking worth it. I have a new job, better relationships and finally getting a handle on what I thought was incurable social anxiety. I actually like myself for the first time since I was a little girl. 

4. I love being a sober person. Life is so much better when you're lucid. I can't believe I used to think weed enhanced experiences when in reality it numbs and dampens them. Experiencing your life fully (and remembering it!) is the greatest gift you can give yourself. 

I don't regret quitting everything at once. I'm an all-or-nothing kind of person and I think it's easier for me to just cut it all out at once but who knows I might have not felt like such a wreck in the early days if I staggered it. 

Its my birthday on Friday and that is my official 6 months. Can't think of a better present to myself!

My psychologist is always telling me to write stuff down to get it out of my mind. If only it was that easy.

(32F) 16 days weed free, I was getting around 5 hours sleep on average a night since I quit this time around, which was manageable but had no appetite. Hunger has finally come back, I'm starving! Last night I started with insomnia. I didn't sleep AT ALL and I feel weak and shaky today and quite frankly, I'm terrified.

Back ground info, I quit smoking weed in late 2018 due to finding out I was pregnant and it went great, insomnia started immediately after stopping and lasted 4 weeks. I bought a V shaped pillow and slept like a baby after that.

Fast forward to mid 2019 when my baby was born, I  had a very traumatic birth that left me with PTSD. For 6 months I battled chronic insomnia which led to some crazy suicidal thoughts, it wasnt that I wanted to die, I irrationally thought dying was like falling asleep and all I wanted was to sleep if that makes sense. 

I sought professional help and ended up as an inpatient which just made things worse. Nothing helped, not even zopiclone. They wouldn't give me anything strong due to having a baby to care for. Out of desparation, I started smoking weed again after I was discharged which gradually got me sleeping. It wasn't instant but it slowly worked. 

I think I'm pregnant again which is terrifying and I'm not sure I can put myself through it again. I don't want to smoke weed and certainly not during pregnancy. Even not being pregnant I hate the secrets and lies, the lack of motivation, the smell etc. I can't smoke in moderation or just at night. I crave the next joint before I've even finished the first. I don't want my kids to be embarrassed to bring their friends home or not being able to afford to give them a good life.

I know I need to wait and see how the next month goes but the intrusive memories from the PTSD has already started and the warning signs are there 😟",1
