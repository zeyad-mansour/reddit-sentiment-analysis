2020-03-30 18:01:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fs0a1f/ultimate_quitters_guide_2_year_repost/,Ultimate quitters guide (2 year repost),"This will be a short (personal) guide about my journey with quitting. Why? Because next to the awsome advice and help I get within this community I am allways interested in ""how long stuff"" lasts or takes to get to a certain point. So when someone asked me to write down my personal experience from day 1 up until day 50 I thought, why not.

Before you think about quitting, just a few notes which might help you determine when/if to quit and what the right setting is for quitting.

**Should I** **quit?**

Quitting smoking (in my experience) is only possible when you are ready to leave smoking behind you. By being ready I mean, when you are clear and in no way intoxicated: Do you want to quit? If the answer is ""Yes"" than I think your ready. Why do I say this. It's because I've had so many times where I lit up, smoked and then got the feeling ""I really need to quit smoking"" only to forget it the next morning or even within a few minutes. In my opinion it's essential to want to quit smoking for yourself. Not quit smoking because a loved one wants it, not because your boss wants it because then it wont work. (Believe me, I tried).

**When to quit?**

Next thing that essential before quitting for most people is a bit of planning! The first few days are going to be pretty rough so in my experience it's best to have planned for this. For me personally it was allways impossible to quit during a work week or even in the weekends because the first 5 days are like hell and the next 5 are still really tough. Obviously stopping before a weekend would be easier than stopping on a Monday but nontheless hard.

I quit on the day I went on vacation (best ever situation) I stopped first of all because I had to (Living in the Netherlands with legal weed and going to Crete, Greece with not so legal and easily obtainable weed), but also I planned that this would be the ideal time as I allready had to stop for the duration of this vacation (11 days). For all others I would suggest to at least take a few days off, do it in a vacation or at least do it in a period with the least amount of stress so you can focus on the goals ahead (stopping).

**Other preparations**

Plan ahead, think about what is the hardest about quitting for you and have a plan for this. Some people have trouble sleeping without weed so for those I suggest buying melatonine before quitting. Some people have been stowing away feelings so make sure you have appointments set with your therapist or at least someone who knows about said problems that you can discuss them with. Some people are easily bored/hyperactive so allready think of activities that you will be doing to handle this. The more you plan before you begin, the easier it becomes to quit and to be succesful at it. I personally think that it's best to plan for all three of the situations above in advance, in my case I needed all three to be succesful.

**So now let's quit!**

*(from here it becomes more of my personal story)*

**Day 1**

Every thought I have is about ""weed"", ""smoking"", ""toking"", ""rolling a joint"" and on and on.. Lucky me, I am on vacation and know damn well that I won't come any close to weed for the next days. My advice for you is to stay away as far as possible from anything that can remind you of weed. Your supplies, Friends that smoke, dealers, spots that you used to go and so forth. This day is about making a new you and everything which could draw you to smoking should be avoided and away from you as far as possible. Like I said earlier if you have the chance to take a leave from work or be free from school than please go somewhere for a few days. Doesn't really matter where as long as it's not linked to smoking. I would suggest nature. (allways helps).

Expect to be really sweaty all day, to feel nausea and to have trouble sleeping at night (here comes the melatonin). I got around lots of these problems by going out to a nice dinner and having a few drinks (I never drank in the years I smoked). Be careful though as you can't replace one pleasure drug with another. Also keep in mind that this is the hardest day you will ever face. From here on out it only gets easier.

**Day 2 - Relapse day?**

For me (if I've had been home) this would have been the hardest day.. You know why? Because you've just conquered the first day (which is the actual hardest) and are happy that you made it. You actually want to celebrate.. but with what are we used to celebrate? With a nice lil' toke.

This day happened to me so many fucking times.

Keep going! Keep it strong and today will be just that 1 or 2% less tough than day 1.

**Day 3 - 5**

The stuff is pretty much the same as the first and second day.. only just a little bit more doable, a little lighter so to speak. Sweating still occurs, that general feeling of not being OK is still there only it's just a bit lighter. Important note for everyone is to remember to keep talking. Keep talking to either us at [r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/) or to your therapist (whether a real therapist or just a really good friend). Keep sharing your problems, the problems you see and encounter while stopping so it becomes less of a burden on you. I seriously talked to my girlfriend about a hour every day just to share my pitfalls, my general feeling or whatever. So don't be scared to talk to people (or write stuff down).

**Day 5 - 10**

It's getting a bit milder. By now hopefully the sweating will go from getting less to being gone and if your lucky normal sleep will be had as well. This is also the point where something else will keep you drained and sometimes awake during the night and that is vivid dreaming. Don't worry it takes a while to get used to (about a week - 2 weeks max) but you will and you will again enjoy it.

**Day 10 - 20**

The very hardest part is done. You're an actual human being again and its probable that your body either allready functions better or it will start functioning significantly better at this point. I came back from vacation after day 11 and I felt like 100% better than I did as a smoker (spoiler: it will get even better than that.) I used to ride the bike as a smoker and rode about 5-10 km a month, while the rest I did by car. Now I rode within at week 25 km (commute to work and some excersize) that's allready so much of an improvement to what I did before so I celebrate that.. Yes, you hear me right.. celebrate all the little things that you accomplish. By now you should have a celebration that doesnt include smoking. So go for that nice hike, treat yourself to a fancy dinner or buy yourself a cake. Just make sure to enjoy the little things you overcame. By day 15 I had left alone my asthma medicine and while I still needed it every now and then I felt so much better conditioning and breathing wise.

**Day 20 - 35**

In my opinion this is where it gets a little bit harder again. Not because you have trouble with something but more because the newness of not smoking, well it's not new anymore. It's not that big of an accomplishment anymore and you start to forget how the first few days were.. This is a hazard for relapse.. For me personally this is why I kept track of all those little celebration moments just to remind myself of how far I had come from where I was. Conditioning is going through the roof and you are building new habits that hopefully will replace the old ones for forever. Yes, the occasional thought of smoking is still there, but answer this truthfully? How much is it now compared to in the first few days?

**Day 35 - 50**

Its gets easier every day.. I now rode the bike for 75km the last week and I feel great, ready to take on the world. We've just passed the 6 weeks mark and this is exactly the time it takes to form new habits. Yes, alot bores me still.. but that is I guess a battle of patience. Where in the first few days I was sure I was going to relapse, now I feel sure I will never smoke again.. What a difference 50 days make. From now on I am an amateur again taking day 50-infinity for the first time.

If you guys have any questions, suggestions or whatever on the first 50 days than just shoot me and Ill add it into the guide so that all of us can make it until 50 days.

**Day 50-90**

Phewwww.. these days, at least for me were a breeze. I could finally (yet slowly) started returning to activities that I had liked when I was still a smoker and not feel the urge or need to smoke with them. Let me tell you that is a great feeling to have. The thoughts about smoking in general were little and lots of time in between so it seemed as though this was the easiest time within my current journey to sobriety.

**Day 90-110**

THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE HARDEST PART, aside from the first few days.. It's not so much that these days are actually that much harder (they aren't) but you do make it alot harder on yourself I suppose.

Let me explain!

Somewhere around day 90, the three month mark I started feeling completely like the old me again. No urges at all, no journey to keep of weed, no signs or struggles to relapse. It allmost feels like you have just beat your addiction..

That's the problem! Somewhere I read that after the three month mark you would feel so normal somewhere in your mind thoughts pop up which say something or some variation of the following ""So I have beat this addiction, I am clean again. So I could just light up a joint and be a sometimes smoker now and just smoke for this or that occasion"". We all know that when thinking rational that this ""one time smoke"" will turn in to a two time smoke which will slowly and steadily turn into you being at the same point you were before quitting smoking. Make sure to not give in to these thoughts!

What I did to battle it, is to start a new goal and a new journey this time into getting my weight under control (did this from day 70-100) and now trying to get my coffee consumption under control (day 100 and onward). This gives me a constant goal and keeps me distracted from the fact that ""quitting weed"" has become so easy it's actually not a challenge anymore.

The other thing I do to reflect and stave off the thoughts is to read [r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/) and go though the stories of people who are at the beginning of this fine journey to get motivation for why I never want to go back to day one.

The one thing I still wonder, sitting here at day 108 is if the sporadic thoughts of smoking will ever completely vanish and if the split personality I am (uber productive, weak focus when I dont smoke) and (do absolutely nothing, focus on BS for 6 hours and just chill when I do smoke) will ever mesh and form the super person I am..

Just like last time I will update whenever I get further into this journey. My last update was at 50 days so this is roughly 2 months ago!

Most of the time, by default, I'm stuck on a problem - it's hard to move forward, unless I'm forced to by a deadline. I'm constantly overthinking things, nothing is exciting, no ideas are cool.

As soon as I smoke (even just a little tiny hit of a vape), or have a 2mg edible, I have tons of ideas - I'm filled with joy and play, and I make a ton of progress. It also makes me feel really confident in my ideas, enough to move forward with them without questioning myself, which is otherwise rare. Unfortunately, this wears off after a few hours, and I feel confused, pessimistic, I overeat, and get poor sleep.

Does anyone else have this experience of weed helping them do better work, and generally think better? Do you know why this happens, from a neurochemistry perspective? Do you know what other methods might be available to achieve this effect?

Do you really think that all those people are having nothing but fun? The biggest advocates often have the worst addiction. By encouraging people to smoke and saying it is good for you if you are high 24 hours a day, many of them are trying to convince themselves and justify their own addiction. Do you really think Snoop Dogg would ever come out and say he has a problem with it? Hell no, that would ruin his image. Do you really think he is still having nothing but fun with weed? When I see him on his shows, or just anywhere, you can see he almost looks like a zombie. Now don’t get me wrong I like Snoop but dont believe everything. My experience is its better not to talk about our weed addiction to other stoners because they will just turn against you. Yesterday I told a stoner friend of mine that I had my second clean day. He first asked me how i did it, then he said good for me in a sarcastic way and then blocked me on all social media. And this guy is known in our circles as the guy who always talks about that weed is only good for you and that everyone should smoke it.

I am basically on verge of losing my marriage, and my step kids because I can’t quit smoking weed. There’s a lot of backstory, not sure I want to bore you guys.

I’m 33, daily smoker since 15. Smoked my whole life. When I met my wife 4 years ago I was running an illegal cannabis dispensary making 40k a month. Smoked all day, she didn’t care. We eventually get engaged. While engaged I got busted. After I got bailed out I immediately moved in with her and the two boys and put my house on the market.

We never lived with eachother before getting married, and now she hatessssss the weed. She has a lot of personal issues dealing with her mom and her alcoholism. When she sees me stoned it triggers her emotions about feelings unloved and alone. 

I have my own issues and I guess I always used weed to avoid life and dealing with my insecurities. While I was on probation from my drug arrest, I didn’t ski oh I much. I promised her after probation I wouldn’t start smoking again. I was wrong. I’m back to smoking daily and it’s really putting a strain on our marriage.

I want to quit. I have a bunch of times in the past for months at a time. For some reason it’s so hard now I’m really scared I’m going to lose my family. I don’t know what I would do if my kids were taken away. My wife feels lonely because I’m always stoned. 

I also feel like my pot usage has stunted my emotional maturity. My wife enjoys a deep emotional connection and conversation. For some reason I don’t, I think being stoned my whole life made it easy to avoid emotional connections, and now that part of me is broken",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82710904}"

-I was a daily smoker of cannabis for about 7 years (ages 17-25)
-The longest I had went without it since starting was about 15 days. 

I will finish my third full day of not smoking at 1am my time. I was to the point that I wasn’t getting high at all anymore, the last two days I smoked, I bought a quarter and smoked it all within those two days... and I never really felt any high from it. I was getting so irritated at my body for not letting me feel high. I had also recently started coughing almost every time I would hit anything. This was not always the case for me so I could tell it was not normal. I was to the point of hacking or almost throwing up every time I hit it and this made the experience even worse. I felt like I had no choice but to abruptly quit, but holy shit was I scared.
Any time I have quit, even for a day or two I start to lose my appetite and have extremely vivid dreams. These are my worst withdrawals and usually the causes for me going back to the bud. Also, I have always tried to go through the quitting alone and I think that was a big factor in me returning to smoking so fast or at all. I had talked with someone really special to me (they don’t live near me atm) and they encouraged me to talk to a close family or friend and have them hold all of my smoking materials. So I did, I talked to my mom and told her everything I was going through and asked for her help in this. She brought up a really good point after I told her that cannabis wasn’t even enjoyable anymore. She said if I start having cravings to think about what I just told her about how I don’t get any joy from it and right now it is not helping me in any way. That really struck me bc I never framed it that way.
I ended up gathering all of my materials into a box and sat down in front of it before handing it over. I had a brief moment to myself to reflect on why I am doing this and spoke out loud my intentions. It gave me some slight peace before I started the actual journey. 
It was also really hard to admit it, but smoking and the high is something I crave profusely and I absolutely hate feeling like I have something that is controlling me. I reflected back to how many times I had treated others badly bc I didn’t have my fix or how I would beat myself up over it. I don’t want these feelings anymore and I for sure do not want to impose them onto the people I love. That hurts more than anything. I owe it to myself to go through this journey of quitting before it gets worse and I’m losing even more of my health, mental health, and sanity. 
I am taking it moment by moment and day by day, but my first long term “goal” is to make it past the amount of time I did last time, which was abt 15 days or so. I am not positive how long I plan to go as I do use cannabis for some medical purposes, but I need to get this under control now. I have had so many times where I continued to push my quitting back and kept smoking, but I knew this time had to be it.
I’m only on day three, but I see that as so much progress for me. I have had a few cravings here and there, but I keep reminding myself of they “why.”

Thank you if you read all of this, I know it was long. I really just needed to get this out somewhere where I knew others could understand what I’m going through. I felt for myself that I needed to type this out and get these feelings out there.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6522521}"

I could say what started out as casual recreational use with friends, and alone at midnight in my room, was pretty innocent. Then my mom passed away suddenly and traumatically (I was there when she passed) one night. It was a massive heart attack. I told myself I didn’t want to smoke, because being high was probably the reason she died. That was not true, obviously. All of this happened in 2012. I had quit smoking, but decided to take it up again because I was feeling so bad, I couldn’t sleep, eat, or feel normal. It was kind of like a AHA! moment for me when I realized I didn’t have to feel pain anymore. I could feel happiness now! 

That didn’t last for very long, though. I spent a few months being a heavy smoker, got on antidepressants, kept smoking and hated the meds because they stopped letting me eat food or even look at it. I didn’t communicate to my therapist and just gave up on them, continuing to rely on weed, heavily. Since I started dating my boyfriend of four years my weed consumption has always been an issue. I tend to shrug it off while still being respectful. So I gave up my bong and moved to vapes. After being a vape addict for a few years, I am now at the end of my rope. I see how addicted I am, so that I think of weed when I wale up or do anything. I think of why it would be better if I had weed. 

Well, lately I’ve had to take many a T break. And after careful observation, I realize that it is holding me back. I don’t have to be high to eat, and I can be sober on hard days. Does that shitty black cloud come over? Sure. I’m doing what I can to make it go away. But sadly, some days it makes a home in my home and all I can do is say hey and try not to piss it off. I don’t want this to go on for too long, but it’s kind of helping me express this icky feeling. 

Before I end, at the moment, I feel emotional. I know that life isn’t always positivity, and people express their feelings in their own ways. I’m learning to accept that. I’m trying to understand other peoples feelings without taking it personally. I’ve always felt like a victim, and I don’t want to be that way anymore. So I’ll need to figure out how to walk this path of sobriety. I am not alone. I’m not crazy. I am an addict. I am addicted to marijuana. I’ve lost a job because of it. That alone put me through other types of hell.  Am I really going to spend the rest of my life trying to be high just because Snoop and Kevin Smith do it? That’s usually my excuse, but those fools actually DO stuff with their lives and I just watch Netflix and vape. I don’t even go outside, because it definitely did make me paranoid and afraid to talk to people. Wow. What a post. Will post again in 30 days. Thanks for listening.

When I was turning wrenches on cars all day I could deal since I know the industry and job so well but now that I've started something new and with so much more potential I need to buckle down.  I'm getting married this year, buying a house, and so much more.  So many good things to come and I want to be 100% present for all of it.  Hell even the hard and uncomfortable parts I want to be 100% present for.

I'm not going to say marijuana is terrible or that nobody should ever use it but when I look back and remember, or not, all of the life events that I ""had"" to be high for its such a waste.  I thought I had to be high to relax or enjoy myself and really what it did was numb me so I was barely functional.  This was the draw and the hold that marijuana had over my life.  If anything was uncomfortable or I just wanted to fast forward through something I would just get high.  Bored? Get high.  Customer being an asshole at work? Get high.  Folding laundry? Get high.  Eating dinner?  Well we all know what that means, time to get high. Etc.

It just wasn't good or helpful and I want to be done with it.  I actually just realized this last night as I sat down at my computer with a joint and was getting ready for a night of playing games since my city is sheltering in place.  I was smoking and the realization just kind of hit me that I don't even *want* to be high.  I was just doing it because its what I did, it was a routine.  Work done, exercise completed, chores finished, now smoke weed.  So I tried to think it through, why was I getting high and did I actually like how it felt? Was it beneficial to any of my goals?  I paid close attention to what my body was telling me and the fog, the pounding heart, the tightness in my chest, it all sucked.  So why?

Apologies for the burner account, but I guess I must be ashamed of this... Longtime stoner here. My use has been up and down for decades now since 'high' school in the 80s with chronic weed use starting most recently about fifteen years ago. I'm an everyday smoker, mostly just before bed and casual daytime use here and there when off work. For a while now I've been stuck in the pattern of starting up slowly with use increasing until my tolerance builds too much and then a short break to get back to normal and repeat.
To this point my biggest barrier is lack of sleep due to terrible restless legs, friends who still use, and boredom.
I'm currently 7 days in and have yet to have a dream that I remember, but I'm able to concentrate enough to enjoy reading a novel (a former joy) and have started sleeping through the night. Up until last night it was fitful tossing and turning followed by stretching between a few two hour 'naps' until daybreak. Every time seems harder than the last and I feel it's time to stick with it.
Thank you. I've been creeping here for a while on my real account and the community y'all have here seems very supportive.

It’s been so much the “new normal” that I missed celebrating my half-year milestone! I wanted to share some reflections at this point. 

I made a list before I quit, of reasons I was doing it. I really recommend this to people who are quitting. It helped me to go back to this especially in the early weeks when I was having a hard time with PAWS. 

That hard time was actually eye opening for me. One of the motivations not to relapse was that I never want to have to go through PAWS again, especially the off-the-charts anxiety. 

Benefits now mainly are less brain fog, less of that grinding low-level pot anxiety, less worrying about running into people I know when I’m stoned, and way better connection with my emotions and therefore better able to figure out who I am and what I want from life. 

There’s still stuff I miss. I really liked weed for sex, exercise, and doing boring shit like housework. I still think about that sometimes, how much nicer those things would be if I were high. But the tradeoffs aren’t worth it. 

Covid has made it harder. I’m alone in a small apartment all day, and my social needs are not getting met.  Sometimes I think I’d like to insulate myself in a cloud of stonedness. But again, it’s not worth it. 

Thanks to this group for giving me inspiration and a place to express myself. If you want some support or just want to talk, I’ll take PMs from anyone.

I have smoked since I was 15 and I am 31 now. On avg after the first year I have likely smoked full time all the time. 

I did a quick sum and spending £40 a week for that long came too around £32000. That figure is likely more if you factor in extra pays, bonuses, ticks and dreads. Lets not count the shit I pawned (makes me sick) I remember blowing half of my student loan one summer on it.. 

You know what is really sickening though besides that figure being a mortgage or possibly a tree on a small island / many holidays.. The people I am left surrounded by. 

I am quite an academic fellow, I love learning and writing. I always thought stoners were open minded and really intelligent folk ( and often they are) but the sheer amount of weed abuse left them less than they truly were.  Lonely,  selfish, quick to anger, resentment towards the world and particularly the ""system"". All the while expecting the world to be compassionate and understanding that they deserve everything for little to no effort. 

The above example comes from my weed dealer and everytime he opens his mouth utter stupidity often comes out blessed with the above emotions. My personal fav example is how Video Game Developers need to pull their finger out. By the way the guy in question hates most new ones and especially if it changed his perfect game. 

This non-acceptance of change and lack of motivation to change and grow is what has led me to realise that I no longer want to be around these people.  Even my two oldest friends( 27 years of friendship) are less than before these days. 

How it made me feel recently:

I am so angry all the time, I resent the world. 
I hate myself frequently. 
My whole day revolves around it, wasting hours waiting to score. Waiting on dealers, money, friends. 
Losing good friends over silly things 
""like you took my last bong""
Days of feeling cloudy, pulled by the dark weight that hangs from my neck. 
Losing money and time to crap deals and dodgy shit. Wasting time moping about weed. 
Forever searching for myself and path.
An embryonic shell of black feelings. 
My eyes are open but my mind and soul often feel shut.

The sheer scumbags you sometimes actually meet in these circles. I was robbed by one of these many moons ago. Lets not talk about the other drugs that have been around me. Thankfully many mons ago too.

So that's it. I am done with this fucking shit. I am on Day 1 and barely slept. I broke up with my girl last night telling her I need to get myself right.
I will check in tomorrow and let you know what is happening

Need advice M[25]","Hey guys. Have been on the fence lately if I should quit or not but I wanted to hear some experiences first hand to solidify the fact that I probably should stop.

Long story short. I’m 25, been smoking since I was 21 (started because I wanted to escape a breakup). Since 21 I’ve smoked almost everyday. It was never a consistent all day thing. I was Always more of a bowl or 2 before I go to sleep person. Anyways, I’m about to graduate university this spring for finance and I’ve been in a 2 year relationship. My partner (F 24) is also a big smoker. Before I started smoking I was completely very confident, loved making friends and was very social / ambitious. Fast forward to now, it’s the opposite, I’ve lost many friends, my memory sucks, I have become a lot less confident, and I  have isolated myself for a very long time, so long that I feel like I don’t even know where I stand on many things emotionally. 

I’m ready to grab life by the balls now. I’ve feel like I’m coming to the point in my life where weed doesn’t hold my interest as it once used to. Now that I’m about to graduate I do feel the need to quit and move on with focusing on my career path. With this also creeps some scary questions to my mind. One of them being, if whether or not I seriously do want to be with my girlfriend anymore. Throughout my 2 years with her, I’ve never been sober within the relationship. I’m scared because I feel like I’m coming to the conclusion of not knowing how I truly feel about her because I was numbing myself and escaping reality the entire relationship with her. P.S. my girlfriend is amazing, cute, sweet, very smart (has her masters), good work ethic, but loves to spend most of her time being unproductive and not work on her self and that bothers me because I’m about to graduate and have to start looking for a corporate job soon.

Whenever I think about quitting smoking I think about how I want to return to being a participant in life, especially now since I’m about to graduate university. I want to move to a different city and am so open to starting a new life. I want to actually be more social, make a lot of new friends, and have fun with confidence like I used to before smoking. Whenever I think of these ideas it makes my heart full and happy because I love the idea of starting completely fresh and to be a go getter in life. 

What holds me back is that I’m afraid of what lies for the future of my current relationship because if I were to quit smoking then this would be the first time I’d be in my relationship sober. I don’t know where my true feelings would lie about how I feel in the relationship though only because I don’t know what it would be like to not escape my emotions everyday. I feel like I’m stuck at a cross road and I don’t want to hurt my girlfriends feelings.

* No longer feel the need to hide from my friend/family or suffer panic attacks when they want to call me while I'm high

* Thinking seems a little clearer

* No-weed streak gives me something to take pride in

* Saving money

* No more binge-eating junk food

The Cons:

* Feel exhausted the entire time I'm awake

* Even less motivation to get things done than when I was smoking

* Chronic pain has grown worse every day

* Multiple vivid nightmares every night, waking up and needing a while to convince myself it wasn't real

* Feels like I'm enjoying life much less in general - everything seems bleak, ugly and stinging

* Creativity: gone. Bad for my job as I do creative work but that has been on the decline for a while before I quit

* Seems like the day passes me by way faster

I'm a 24 years old man and before I quit weed a 100 days ago I have smoked pretty much everyday excpeting 2 one month breaks and unless I was on trips where weed wasn't readily available.

So, at 14 years old, I was insecure, super sensitive and although I was liked by lots of people at school and in my sports team I never felt like I fit in socially. I was socially anxious and like I said super sensitive so I turned to pot as I didn't see any better option to leave these feelings unseen.

After about a year of smoking almost daily, I already knew I was escaping something(s). It made me more anxious, paranoid. I didn't take the opportunities that were in front of me with potential new friends or quite a few girls who showed interest in me. I always felt things so deeply and while weed made me feel better on occasions, most of the time it made all of these feelings I perceived as negative stronger.

A couple of month ago, I started to reduce a little bit my smoking. I would smoke daily but only roll a five a day and smoke in 3-4 times. I know for some people it's all or nothing. I get it, it was like that for me for a long time. I just felt obligated to do that because I would have seriously killed myself if I didn't at least reduce my consumption because of how useless and inferior it made me feel.

On december 18th I decided that morning that I was simply done. I've had enough of the same thing everyday. I knew how my day was gonna be if I smoked. I knew what my life was gonna look like 10 years from now. I just decided to drop it and I didn't look back. Of course, there are days when I feel like taking just a little toke. I know it's not the answer. I created the metrics on which I base what's important for me and it's enough for me to not get back on that bad habit train which consist mostly of weed and feeling like shit. 

Everyone's different, so I didn't want to dive in the details that were crucial for me to change the mindset I was in for so long that helped me to finally make that decision and to only go forward. 

Though I wanna say that exercise, meditation, good sleeping habits, a little bit of prayer (whatever that means for you), and the more social time you can get that'a tolerable for you (if you have friends/family) help a lot. I was still able to keep up with most of these things or to bring them into my life while being a stoner so at least I had that which made it easier. Thus, I can't speak for everyone. 

I know you guys wanna know about how it made my life better. So here we go. The benefits are quite subtle but if I look back they are really obvious : 

- My sleep has improved a lot and I dream and remember my dreams almost every night.

- When I'm doing something, I do it fully. I don't really wanna rush home to smoke like I did before and missing on something.

- I'm more motivated to go to the gym or to go for my runs than I was while always high.

- Even though I don't know exactly what I wanna do with my life, I now have a clear conscience because I know I'm not escaping my confusion.

- Related to the second and last points, I live life fully. In the sense that I experience most of the things I go through in the present moment without escaping and wanting to be somewhere else or do something else. Even if what I'm going through is uncomfortable.

- I'm so proud of myself and people around me are as well.

- I left behind relationships that were not really important to me and that I entertained only because of weed. And the relationships I have now are lived with more depth.

- Everyday can be different if I choose it to be while before as a stoner I was so stuck up on my narrowed views that I didn't even see a tad of new potential opportunities.

If I can suggest one thing for you who are trying to quit is to stop trying to get rid of a habit and trying implementing other healthy ones. You can't just stop something that gave you some much dopamine for months/years without replacing it with something healthy and make it sustainable. If you're trying to quit and you slip, don't be hard on yourself, just try understand why you smoked and try to do differently the next day. And if you manage to stop one day, before bed, write 3 positive aspects of not smoking weed. Do that everyday until you no longer need to. The thing here is to reward the positive instead of feeling guilt about the negatives. We know all to well how guilt makes us want to smoke even more to forget about how weak and shitty we feel. 

I wanted to make it short, but as my usual self I couldn't. I hope that helped a little bit for you who are trying to stop. I feel so proud of what these first 100 days without a crutch for more than 10 years. I hope you will be able to get what I meab by that a 100 days from now, or may be more, as long as it stays guilt free.

The last time I really enjoyed it and smoked consistently was over four years ago...the thought of being high nauseates me.  I would never do it because it's like hurting myself.  It is an amnesiatic or panic-ful day rolled up into a little sleeve.

What helped me was meditation, and using that as a doorway into objectively examining what weed does to my experience.  Meditation actually makes you more vulnerable to pain.  Cannabis is one of those drugs that benefits from the user not examining what it is actually like to do it...

It turns me into a pleasure fiend.  It makes me more creative, but briefly - and it's a random, cartoonized creativity, not a real creativity.  Not focused creativity.  It makes conversations disintegrate into shameful drives home where you desperately text your friend the next day, ""Hey lol sorry if I was acting weird last night..."".  To which they always reply, ""No lol you were fine dude.  Thanks for coming over.""

I *know* that even if it sucks now, a year from now I will be glad I’m doing this. It *will* be worth it. Enough of this instant gratification.

A week without weed was a very rare and “lucky” occurrence. It would pretty much only happen if I had absolutely no way to get it. So this New Years I decided I’m going for a year without getting high on any form of weed/ thc. I wrote myself a note so that I can read it to remind myself why I’m doing it. 2 weeks in my friend slept over at my house and he had a blunt. I told myself I’d be fine and everything. I wasn’t. I really wanted to hit that blunt. I was so close to breaking and decided obviously I had to read my note. I read it and agreed with everything it said, cause well... it made sense. The reasons I had put were right. So thanks to my note I didn’t smoke that night, or the day after when my friend slept over again and I was still tempted so I read the note again. Right after that weekend, I added more stuff I thought should be said in the note. I’m now a few days short of 3 months sober from weed. It’s scary to think what would happen if I had broke 2 weeks in. When I cave once, I cave 20 times. So I know for a fact if I broke then it would be over and I wouldn’t be where I am today. I feel great and my life is so much better without weed. That never ending cycle of feeling like I’m failing sucks. 

I’ve seen a lot of advice on here and it’s really good. I don’t know much more to add besides this. Maybe write yourself a note or something. My note saved me. Yours might too. It’s just a good reminder. If you’re someone who’s trying to stop but then tell yourself “once won’t hurt” but then once hurts a lot lol, then remind yourself what happens every time in your note if you choose to write it. It’s pretty easy to be in the moment and not think too clearly when the opportunity to smoke is right in front of you.

Day 5 of no weed. I have quit years ago because of the same issues of panic attacks.
But last Saturday, a panic attack just came out of nowhere after years and years of being dormant, I had to call an ambulance which was a huge blow to my ego as I haven’t done anything like that since like 7 years ago..

I feel like it has come at a great time and a not so great time, as my fiancé is 7 months pregnant and I always wanted to quit before the little one comes, but no great because we’re basically in lockdown here and I’m suffering from severe anxiety and panic attacks every day since quitting. Which has been unusual for me as back in the day once I quit weed the panic attacks dissipated, but now it’s just lingering. To the point I had to see my Dr who prescribed me a one time fill of Valium to take the edge off any panic attacks that may occur.

I’m going through a weird roller coaster of emotions right now where I feel really excited for a clear headed future with my little young family and then on the other hand I’m dealing with really high anxiety, and depersonalisation where I feel like I’m losing touch with reality ??

I wish I could have a more healthier relationship with MJ at this time, but it just seems like it doesn’t agree with me anymore and I just need to accept that and move on. My problem is now I’m trying to distract myself but it’s hard to distract myself when I’m fearing another panic attack, even the Valium sometimes doesn’t completely help.

I know I will get better, but I’m having a really rough time right now and being extremely emotional, crying my eyes out some nights because I think I will be stuck like this forever and feeling like I just want to be in a hospital bed so I can be looked after, my thoughts are just all over the place.

And I am not trying to play the victim card at all. I'm just trying to get out my feelings from head to paper and see if there is anyone else that has felt similarly.

I smoked a lot between the ages of 19 - 25 (about to turn 26 in a month). It didn't become a daily habit til I was 21, where I would smoke around a gram or so a day. This increased to a gram, plus edibles, plus dabs / hits from my carts  multiple times a day up until two weeks ago. I've had very few breaks - the most I've gone was two and a half months, about a year ago.

I don't like myself anymore. I've become extremely awkward, can't hold a conversation for the life of me, my memory is dreadful, I'm not able to read people at all, and I feel like all my relationships are slowly deteriorating because of all of the above. I'm unable to enjoy all the things I once loved doing. I've started having thoughts of ceasing my existence (not suicidal and don't have the urge to kill myself, I just want to not exist anymore). It scares me, a lot. To think that I got to this point.

The crazy thing is, I knew I was better off without weed years ago. I knew I had an issue. I remember telling my friends in college before it became a daily habit that I wanted to quit, but I was never able to. I would always go to weed whenever I was bored. Which then turned to when I was stressed. Then to when I wanted to feel somewhat normal. I eventually just didn't care. I would smoke my days away, from the moment I woke up til I fell asleep.

I know I've done a lot of damage to my brain. I just feel so dumb. Like I can't do anything to sustain myself. Am I able to reverse any damage and get somewhat back to normal?

I don't have any urge to smoke weed, it hasn't really done anything for me these past few months. I've just given up. I'm really trying to keep my head up, it's just been very hard. Today has been rough.

I was a little over 3 weeks sober until Monday, when I finally took (and passed) my drug test for a big new job (at a hospital), but the anxiety from that and the apocalyptic feel of the Coronavirus outbreak (my state started ordering some big things the day before) was just too much.  I smoked a bowl and was just immensely disappointed in the experience, but I keep going back and smoking since.

Now I've gone from feeling terrified that I or someone in my immediate family may die soon, society may collapse, and trying to be a better person and get my shit together for that to becoming completely passive and numb to the world.  And it sucks.  I didn't like being scared and anxious, but when life is really scary you \*should\* be able to feel it so you can take action.  Right now I just can't do that because of weed.

Starting with an edited post I created a while back to make it relevant to today's new world. Much love and strength to anyone I've met so far on this journey and all those I'm about to.*

So I've noticed this place gets a lot of ""about to start day 1, y'all got  some tips?"" posts so I've collected a few here to hopefully help. Here goes...  

**Introduction:**  

First  of all, well done. Well done for coming here and trying to help  yourself. Well done for realising you have a problem and having the guts  to do something about it. A lot of people stick their heads in the sand  and pretend it's okay, but YOU reader, clearly haven't. Kudos to that.  And, I'm proud of you right now even if you aren't.  

First few days are an assault on the mind and the body. Big time. But it  shall pass. And once the first hump is over with it gets easier in many  senses.  

**Actual tip time:**  

**Caffeine:**  this stuff is bad when you're quitting (well, all the time really if  abused, and us chemical abusers tend to overindulge...) So, if you  currently abuse it to counteract the effects of the weed hangover as a  normal part of your day, start tapering down. Don't cold turkey caffeine  it's horrible. Try to limit the use to early in the day if you use it.  That includes tea, and sodas with it in. Doing this will help ease any  anxiety and help you sleep.  

**Exercise:**  Mega good. Just do it. Not only will it tire you (help you sleep) but it'll release endorphines and help stress relieve. It'll also keep you busy and will help literally sweat the weed out. Even going for a walk  is good. Get out of the house if you can (and if it is government allowed and safe to do so given Covid 19) You are no longer a prisoner or a slave to your drug or thoughts so get back out into the world again, you've been missed! Although at a socially acceptable distance now please! If you can't get out. Do some online exercise classes. There are even more out there now, and a lot of people are doing this. Bonus point: no one can see you if you're rubbish!  

**Hydration:**  Key. Keep fluids going and try to flush the weed out. I'm not saying  drown yourself with water but you may get bad headaches if you're  missing this step and it's an easy thing to miss.  

**Eating:**  A toughie. This can be a battle. I suffered with nausea and had no  appetite for days. So I drank protein shakes and water for the first few  days. Your appetite may disappear for a while but it will return.  Nausea can be counteracted with ginger tea and ginger ale apparently.  Give it a try if you're struggling.  

**Yoga  / meditation / prayers / mindfulness:** Can be VERY useful. Give em a  try. Relaxes me a lot and helps me shut off the noise and grounds me.  You may have a lot of internal battles coming up so learning how to  overrule urges and bad thoughts should be a priority. Learn how to say  ""no"" to any voice or notion that suggests weed is a good idea and one  more won't hurt. It'll also help if you can find some positivity from  somewhere, as you get free you'll feel it building inside you so listen  to THAT voice and build on every bit of progress you make. It all adds up.   

**Reading:** In the  first few days being alone with my thoughts was terrifying. So I took my  mind elsewhere til I felt normal again. So read. Read anything, it  doesn't matter much what it is although if you choose something you're  interested in or related to quitting, even better. After a while I could  enjoy movies etc again but for the first few days that wasn't  happening.  

**Sleep hygiene:** Super important. Day 1 literally strip your bed and wash the  bedding and for the first night you'll have nice clean bedding which  should help you enjoy your bed again (especially if it reeked of weed)  Then set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. That means no phones, TV or  devices that can distract you for at least an hour before your set  bedtime. Nail this and the insomnia won't be as bad. And the sooner you  can sleep properly the easier the battle is.  

**Communication and support:** Find support (here is a great place) and talk whatever shit you're going through out. Sometimes you'll just want to rage but  you'll feel better after it. Read some of my old posts if you want a  laugh, I said some right crap initially 😂😂 family friends and even  strangers online can be a massive help in stopping you feeling alone.  You are not alone in this addiction and others will understand. Not  everyone will FULLY understand of course, but people here will certainly  have been through similar so don't struggle on alone. Use online or  telephone meetings or therapy if you can. The more weapons you can add  to your arsenal the easier the battle will be.  

**Journalling  / lists / accountability:** I downloaded the Grounded app and in the  first few days checked in every few hours. Every time I felt shit. Or  had an urge. I also used the check ins to write my thoughts down to get  them out. Not everything I went through and thought about I was willing to share with others. I still use the app to check in now although I do  forget (I totally forget since I first wrote this post, but it's still  there should I need it) Being able to literally scroll through my  thoughts and see that little acorn growing has been super useful.  (Seriously download the app it's free 😆) it also tallies how much money  you've saved and how far into each withdrawal you are so you can see  ""Oh I'm 3 days away from not being angry anymore"" 😂 😂 but I also wrote  a lot of things down by hand. The first few nights I needed to keep my  hands busy so I just got some paper and went with it. I'm now trying to  improve my handwriting in the evening and I'm getting there! It'll also help keep you accountable too. You won't want to lose your trophies you  get for each day achieved either. Finding people to keep you accountable  can help a lot too.  

*The  lists side of things...* I wrote reasons why I should stop eg it makes you selfish, it makes you dumb, it makes you apathetic. And then if I  got the urge I looked at that list and remembered why I was doing this. I  also  found a picture of some family and put as my phone background, to  remember who I'm doing this for. That helped a lot in the early days.  Now it's just a picture of the outdoors, something which I now enjoy  again as a former addict now I'm free. And can't wait to get back into  once this epidemic is over with.  

**Love, compassion and forgiveness:** This is for you. Give yourself these 3  things. You deserve them. You've probably fucked a few things up in your  life but it's not worth suffering forever for. We're all human. We all  make mistakes. And the sooner you can give yourself compassion, the  sooner you can forgive yourself. The sooner you forgive yourself the  sooner you can love yourself again. And people who love themselves? Have  the happiest lives and don't self harm with drugs....  

The anxiety, loneliness and sadness will pass.  

This is a tough time for everyone. We're probably all scared, worried and don't know what to do given the world we now inhabit but I feel so so soo much better for being sober for it. I'm still sacred, I'm still sad,  but I'm much clearer headed and able to fight whatever comes my way.   

I won't lie the first bit is hard. But it is possible. And after that? Well I'll let you know as I get there...  

Hope that helps anyone who needs some guidance. And, as always, good luck and stay strong ❤️💪🏻❤️

I don't think I could have done it without this group. It helped me remind me that I'm not alone in this journey. It helped remind me that I can't have just one more.  

I have to say, life has gotten better.  I don't think I'm any more productive than I was earlier.  I am happier though.  I've picked up a few more hobbies. I can afford eating out now. I no longer have to worry about having enough stuff, papers,  tobacco or is my lighter working. I no longer feel a pressure in my head when I really want to smoke.  I no longer have anxiety spirals. 

I did gain some weight though.  I feel like I replaced smoking with eating to an extent. It's a different struggle but also the same.

I like that I don't cough as much and I wake up feeling fresher. 

Honestly,  the time I spent smoking seems like a dream. I don't think about it any more. I still am confronted with urges every now and then. But they are way milder, more of a thought, that I can dismiss. However,  I still need to be vigilant. 

I do have to thank one of my friends though.  Let's call him A. I went to my home country for the first time since I quit and was hanging out with him. I was never sure if I could  refuse a joint if he offered or any of my undergrad friends tbh. I confided this to him while we are hanging out and he told me 'You have quit right?' I said yes. He said,  'Then end of story'. That vote of faith reinvigorated me and I was able to stay sober despite everyone around me smoking.

Celebrations! I’ve made it to 7 months sober. It’s been a pretty rough ride for me. I’ve endured the full brutality of PAWS (Post Acute Withdrawl Syndrome). I’m very happy to say I keep improving, though I’m not out of the woods yet. I write this post for my own self therapy, and documentation, but also to spread awareness of this condition, and to foster hope for others and myself if you are suffering through this. PAWS has been absolutely and unequivocally the most hellish thing I’ve ever been through. Yet it seems that this too shall pass. Just need to give it time. You can search my posts for more, but here is a brief synopsis. 

**Introduction**

I’m a 37 year old Male in excellent health. I have run multiple marathons, earned a Yoga Certification, and Strength Train. I focus on my nutrition, and value being fit. For the past 10 years I have been in very good health. I never even smoked before last summer. 

I decided to use weed recreationally last summer with my vaporizer. I was looking for a replacement for alcohol (thinking it might be more fun and healthy…I never drank much anyways...and I was curious) I used  Cannabis for about 3 months. I started slow, and then ramped up my use, using it first only on the weekends, and then every few days. I finished on my birthday, having about a gram’s worth of higher potency THC weed. Right after that I went cold-turkey off weed. 3 days later I awoke in the middle of the night with a massive panic attack, thinking I was going to die. 

**Month 1: Voyage into Hell**

The ensuing weeks I suffered massive brain fog, dizzyness, anxiety, and strong disassociation. I could barely walk around my kitchen. And looking at the world was like seeing the world as a video game. Things seemed unreal. It was like my head was floating on my body and I was completely disconnected from reality. Even time seemed to move faster than usual. For just one day, I had a difficult time speaking. My ability to speak words just didn’t seem to work. Scary stuff. I went jogging once and had 15 seconds of double vision. I thought I had a brain tumour or schizophrenia. 

**Month 2: Worse before it gets better**

I kept getting worse and more erratic. So much anxiety, but also add the disassociation, panic attacks, anhedonia, brain fog, nausea, dizzyness, nerve tingles. I’m sure there is more I am forgetting. My brain seemed to get more numb and foggy. I had hard times concentrating and even following conversations. Watching a moving screen made me dizzy as well. My symptoms were so erratic, that every day felt like a nightmare of unknown symptoms waiting to surprise me and torture me. 

**Month 3 - The turnaround begins…slowly.**

All of the above continued to happen, though something awful also began. I began to get huge electrical zaps in my head at night. They are called brain zaps. It felt like a rush of electrical energy, and sometimes it felt like a Christmas tree lighting up inside my head. One scared me so much I had a second panic attack and went to my Doctor. He gave me an Ativan but I turned it down. I did not want to add any more neurological variables to my situation, and I did not want to become dependent on a new drug, one I never needed before. 

I started to have some moments of recovery though. Little spots in my numb head began to tingle and slightly clear up. This month I had some major mood swings, and my nauseousness and dizziness began to disappear. I had some very minor moments of being able to feel some emotion; those moments made me cry in despair and relief.

**Month 4: Disassociation starts to fade.**

My recovery was more consistent this month, if slow. I got more of the zaps. I always felt a bit more recovered after I received one. They began to calm down in intensity fortunately. The biggest moment this month was starting to come out of my disassociation. I was at the gym , and I put on my glasses, took them off, and put them on again, and realized reality seemed so much more normal. It seemed my proprioception improved. I had a better sense of where my head was in space; it felt more connected to my body than just floating on top of it. I also had some strange albeit brief symptoms. One morning I had a ringing in my ears, like tinnitus, but it went away quick. I also had a brief few seconds of visual snow, which also never returned. 

**Month 5: Less fog and better hearing.** **More stable symptoms.** 

In this month I got quite depressed, feeling like I wasn’t improving much more. My biggest fear is that my healing would stop and that I would be stuck to returning to normal. I was still somewhat disassociated, still foggy, still very numb and anhedonic. The dissociation was mild though, and would come and go sometimes. There was one day though I went for lunch with my folks, and I noticed how crisp and clear everything sounded. I don’t think I even realized how foggy my hearing was. Everything just seemed so much more clear in that moment. That leads us to Month 6. 

**Month 6: Another strong improvement - Can feel small amounts of emotion.**

Month 6 was a much stronger month of change. Parts of my head seemed to improve considerably. I used to smile and feel nothing positive in my head. Slowly my emotional fog started to lift. I enjoyed smiling again. As well, I continued to have tingles in my head that seemed to eventually feel nice. Like electrical work was getting sorted out. A lot of brain fog cleared up, and the world just seemed clearer. 

**Month 7: Gradual Process. Anhedonia slowly lifting.** 

This month now feels like a continuation of last month. I get head tingles that seem to feel nice later on. It feels like cobwebs are being cleared out of my head. I feel more positive feelings, although I still feel numb as well. It’s like there’s two concurrent feelings, the nice ones that are developing and the old crappy headache feelings intermixed. Yet, I have had days of much better energy. My favourite moment this month was listening to music, on a particular song I enjoyed there was a moment that just seemed to send a wave of endorphins through my head. Haven’t felt like that from music since before this began. My anhedonia seems to be lifting. Anhedonia perhaps was the most scary of all of these conditions. The inability to feel joy, sucks the meaning out of everything in life. I have been so happy to see some improvement.  

**Summary / Other odd symptoms.**

 So yes, I have made **HUGE** improvements from when all this began. I still have problems though. As stated above, I’ve had the occasional wave of PAWS symptoms. Once this month I got chills for no real reason. They went away in a few hours. I didn’t get sick, so I have nothing else to base them on than PAWS. I had one random day where my head had a bunch of micro-headaches and I became briefly disassociated again, just for the day. I have lots of odd weird head sensations that come and go. Sometimes I wake up feeling quite anxious / restless. It seems to go away though on it’s on in a day or so. Also I seem to be noticing / developing eye floaters. Could be unrelated though to PAWS. (UPDATE: I went to my eye doctor about it today and she said my eyes are in excellent health. My thoughts are my brain just isn’t filtering them out as well as it used to. Needs more Dopamine.). And I can’t say I feel fog free or that I feel emotions like I used to. The symptoms I’ve listed are more annoying than anything tough. These are much smaller problems compared to what I used to have. I’ve become much more stable as well, and I can look forward to decent sleep most of the time, and symptoms that don’t make want to go hide in bed. 

I think my progress will continue gradually. Probably less dramatically and more slowly, but over a long length of time, I hope to be back to 100% eventually. Maybe at the 1 year mark. 

**Hope**

If you are going through PAWS, my deepest most heartfelt sympathies go out to you. I’ve never gone through anything harder than PAWS. Not only dealing with my symptoms, but with all the psychological guilt from causing this to myself through my experimentation with cannabis. I’ve been seeing a counselor. Talking helps considerably as does nutrition, meditation, writing, creative work, and exercise. I’m so grateful nothing in my life has fallen apart.

PAWS from weed is very real. This condition needs to be talked about and established. I never ever would have touched cannabis if I had known this could happen. I researched weed for months before diving in, and no where spoke of a 2 year withdrawal possibility. Most of what I read indicated only a 3 week withdrawl, not unlike giving up caffeine. This is NOT like giving up coffee at all. I got sucked in by the hype. I accept responsibility, but also I’m still angry that nothing and no-one warned me of this. Cannabis has a place medically, but recreationally…it’s a high risk venture it seems. At least for me. 

 So the good news? If you have PAWS, you don’t have a brain tumour, you don’t have schizophrenia, and you are not going to die. Your brain is simply rewiring and rebalancing its chemicals and neurotransmitters. Healing may take 6 months - 9 months - 12 months - 2 years. I have faith now that I will heal. And my life is liveable now. PAWS is still a burden, but I can manage it. And here’s the wonderful things: My girlfriend still loves me, I still have a job, and everyone thinks I’m healthy. I just have to continue being kind to myself as I heal and become stronger. 

If you are going through PAWS, be strong. You will get better as long as you stay sober. Keep living life and don’t let it hold you back (Taking breaks though is ok :>)

To others without this problem, when someone says they have PAWS, please believe them! It’s hard to even muster any sort of self-advocacy for one’s health when suffering from this affliction. If you quit cannabis and only suffer a few weeks of withdrawl, thank the holy creator. PAWS is like a bomb being dropped in your brain. And the hell it creates in your body is unimaginable unless you go through it. I’m fortunate that my personal Doctor had a few cases like mine over the years, and recognized it early. He said 6 months to a year is my rough timeline for recovery. Just be there for whomever is going through it, and assure them they will be ok in time. When going through a wave of PAWS, having someone to give that reminder and just hold space is ever so valuable. 

I’m so thankful for everyone who has helped me come this far. At one point my conditions were so chronic and so bad, I even thought about suicide (Just in passing). It happened in Month 3 when my symptoms were the worst. Now I have enough hope to keep going, and am returning to my old self. Suicide is far off the table now. 

Remember, if this is you. I’m getting better, and you will too. I’m hoping that this document helps you if you are feeling scared about what you are going through. I have been very scared through all this, and other posts from people on this forum helped me swim my way through my fear and despair. PM me or respond below if you need any advice. You’ll be ok.

I was a heavy smoker for around a decade (from the time I was 17), and because of this drug I've gained a goodly amount of weight. I went from 160 lbs, to 210 lbs at my heaviest a few weeks ago, and I'm only 5 feet tall. I obviously wasn't exactly skinny to begin with, but most of that extra weight can be attributed to the way I was raised by my mother, who had a bad relationship with food as well as many mental health issues. At home, a bag of chips and a 2 liter of mountain dew was dinner pretty regularly. We were very poor, and I went through cycles of not having any food for days, to binging on literally anything I could find that could fill that empty space, sometimes to the point of throwing up. I had to have my gallbladder out at 17 when I moved out of my mom's apartment to live with a friend and her mom, who cooked healthy food as a rule. My doctor told me that the drastic change in diet was likely a big part of what caused the gall stones. 

As an adult, I'm a vegetable and whole grain lover (My mom only ever bought white bread; imagine my surprise when I figured out that whole wheat bread tastes so much better). In spite of being overweight, I'm not pre diabetic, and I don't have any other health problems aside from this damn pot addiction. C19 has been my wake up call, and it's a brutal one. So far my withdrawal symptoms have been pretty tame, and my cravings have been lacking almost entirely. I'm not totally sure why, except that perhaps it has more to do with my mindset this time around, than all the other times I had to quit (usually just because we ran out and couldn't afford more). I've noticed that I'm more attentive to my children, which means a lot to me. I have more energy and my attention span has improved dramatically. I've been having trouble sleeping, and my appetite has pretty much gone away entirely. I try to feed myself anyways, though sometimes I do forget to eat lunch.

After reading through hundreds of stories that echoed my own, I was finally able to admit that I had a problem and quit. Smoking/ingesting weed went from a fun recreational activity to a substance that would just numb me. Monthly use turned into daily use and eventually, I reached the point where not only did I not enjoy getting high anymore, I only continued to do it because it stopped me from physically feeling ill. Frankly, I refuse to let a plant continue to dictate how I feel, eat, think, sleep, spend, etc. I am so extremely blessed in the sense that my family and I are in good health and I'm blessed with a job that allows me to be comfortable.

I was wondering if the leaves community has any tips on falling asleep after quitting weed. 

I’ve been a heavy smoker for about a year and a half (two years this 4/20), smoking multiple times a day at my peak, but I’ve cut it down to once a day at night since last fall. 

I’m using this whole coronavirus mess to take a t break for the first time since I’ve started smoking, since it’s incredibly hard for me to smoke since I’m back from university and stuck with my parents.

I haven’t had any problem quitting weed cold turkey, no problem with eating or cravings or anything, except I’m completely unable to fall asleep until 6 in the morning earliest. 

I’ve been taking a couple of Benadryl most nights so i can get some sleep, but on the nights i don’t i find it impossible to sleep. Has anyone had any similar problems and know any solutions? Or at the very least, does anyone know how long this is gonna last? I really fuckin like sleep so this whole things kinda a bummer

It never really stopped me from accomplishing things or hurt my motivation.

That said, I just realized the other day how messed up by lungs are. I never stopped smoking long enough to realize it and I always thought I was coughing and congested because I had recently smoked that day. This is the second day in my entire adult life I haven't smoked and my lungs feel terrible. My throat feels like there's a grape stuck in it most of the time. I'm constantly clearing my throat. I feel like I have something in my lungs but nothing ever comes out no matter how much I cough.

Keep in mind, all of this daily smoking all these years was with blunt wraps or dabs. Of course I need to see a doctor, but how bad have I fucked up my lungs? Has anyone else experienced these symptoms and recovered from it? Will this subside a bit after a while? It's really scary.

Also, since I'm in this sub, I have to say not smoking made me EVEN MORE accomplished today than usual! Your posts are definitely spot on.

I have been smoking more or less all day every day for the past 5 years. It started out pretty mild, only smoking maybe once a day but quickly my habits got worse and worse. Wake up....smoke...go to work....vape my pen in the bathroom...come home smoke and play video games and repeat. I am miserable in my job because I have a boss that likes to harass us on the daily whether its cuz hes in a bad mood or just cuz he feels like it. I started smoking more and more cuz I felt like it was helping the tremendous anxiety I have been getting from this job. Only now realizing I have just been digging myself deeper and deeper. All of my family have heard me complain over the years about how miserable I am and they all just tell me to get a new job...but they dont know I've been smoking myself stupid every single day. I feel really silly because any rational person WOULD just go get a new job but because I chose to medicate it makes it harder to get out there and find something. Especially with my motivation and honestly the fear that my next job will be just as miserable as this one. 

I am ready and eager to quit both this job and my bad habits but man has it been hard cuz the more I get stressed from work the more I want to smoke and the more I smoke the more motivation I lose.

I want to be able to buy him things without paying people back, I want to take him on traveling trips, I want to save my money for things he wants to do growing up. 

I'm spending my money right now for rent for a two bedroom apartment every month, 
then spending my left over $400+ on wax & small things for my son..it's getting out of hand.

All the parks are closed, every kid play center is closed. We are bored so this will be a harder time to quit..but I am going to do it eventually!

I was reading someone's post about replacement habits. I NEED AS MANY REPLACEMENT HABITS YOU KNOW OF & the main ones that helped you quit the first week/month! & maybe the reason why they worked for you!!

 I won't be Smokeahhontis anymore,
 I'll be Retired Smokeahhontis

 I am a pot head. I smoke first thing when I wake up, even if it's 5am. I smoke to calm down. I love smoking. 

I have Bipolar, PTSD, Anxiety, depression, & weed seems to be the only thing that helps me calm down when I'm having an episode.

To start, I'm 24 and have been a consistent stoner for 4-5 years with random t-breaks sprinkled in. I am working towards living a healthy lifestyle. I have recently decided that I wanted to free myself of weed and the negatives it brings to my life. I've been dependent on it and it's holding me back. 

I have extremely high ambitions. To achieve the goals I've set for myself, I have combed through my life and identified my bad habits - video games, weed, poor sleep schedule, and Netflix. While creating the list, I noticed one habit, in particular, is the root of the problem. Smoking weed. When I smoke I become content with doing nothing. Smoking leads to the other bad habits listed. 

It also creates a constant fog in my life. I originally thought smoking provided better sleep. Recently, I've been noticing that waking up is much more difficult when I smoke the night before. I am a Software Engineer, so my job requires mental clarity. 

When it comes to taking my t-breaks, I've had great success when completely removing weed from my environment. Out of sight, out of mind. It works like a charm.

With all that being said, I am moving out of my parent's house soon to live with my two best friends. Unfortunately, they are also stoners. 

I am looking for advice on this situation. I think I know the answer, but I would love to hear your thoughts!! 

BTW I am currently 5 days clean :)

I guess since I am not planning on becoming the stoner again (like from the bottom of my heart) it just wasn't that big of a deal to me. I am not disappointed, I am relieved somehow. That it didn't feel as good as I thought it would. That I am fine by leaving it be and be that guy who smokes occasionally. 

My sobriety will continue. I will just forget about it and continue everything I got going the last few months.

2020-03-25 11:01:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/forqgv/today_is_one_year_sober/,Today is one year sober,"1 year ago I just got out of a mental ward because I smoked myself into a manic state and scared my family. I was a long time smoker in high school and college. I got married and had kids and my smoking was occasional more so because I didn’t have access. Once it got easier to get and I found the vape pens I went back to smoking 24/7. 

After coming out of the nut house I kept smoking and fighting with my wife until she finally kicked me out and I realized I needed help. I tried to find a rehab but they won’t take in weed addicts so I found an outpatient program and started my journey. 

What I figured out pretty quick was that I was numbing myself so I could avoid reality. My anxiety took over me and smoking was the only way I knew how to shut down my brain for a couple hours. I had to figure out how to deal with all the shit in my head and find new ways to cope. Luckily I have an incredible wife, family and friends who were there to support me. 

The reason I wanted to post this is to let others know you can do it. I read posts on this sub everyday where people are frustrated that they keep relapsing and struggling and I can sympathize with them. My heart goes out to all of you and I know people act like quitting weed is no big deal. I understand how it’s always in your mind somewhere. Sometimes it’s right in front of your face and sometimes it’s that devil on your shoulder but it’s always there somewhere. 

Here are the few things I learned this year and hopefully it will help someone else. 

- Habits are buried deep in your brain. The reason I like weed so much is because my brain associates it with a happy moment. Don’t get frustrated if you’re struggling. Your brain is powerful and this stuff happens deep in your subconscious. 
- Find a replacement habit. Try and do it every day to replace your daily smoking habit. For me it was meditation / mindfulness. 
- Lean into your cravings. Don’t whistle past the graveyard and pretend like nothing is happening. Feel that desire and see if you can figure out what’s triggering it. Maybe you’re just bored or lonely and weed was your way of coping with those feelings. 
- I struggle with the concept of quitting forever. The best advice came from an AA meeting. ""You can always chose to smoke tomorrow if you want. Just choose to not smoke today."" The cliche of “one day at a time” has stuck around for a reason. 
- Find others to talk to. This could be an AA / NA meeting, a therapist or just understanding friends. Meet with these supporters every week. It helps to talk to others who understand the struggle. 
- Try AA / NA meetings. You’ll feel weird at first and you don’t have to tell them that weed is your problem if you’re insecure but you’ll be surprised how similar your stories will be. You don’t have to get a sponsor and work the steps if you don’t want to but I’d recommend trying to find a group for support and there are literally thousands of meetings in this country every day. 
- Be careful not to replace one addiction with another. Remember what makes us pot heads is the we are compulsive people. You may be sober but eating, sex, working out, recovery can all become too much if we get compulsive with any of those as well. 
- If anyone is struggling to understand why you can’t quit the best analogy I found is to relate it back to dieting. Pick whatever is that persons favorite food and ask them if they could stop tomorrow and never eat (ice cream, pizza, etc) again and if they would have any difficulty avoiding those temptations. Remember everyone has something they can’t give up our weapon of choice just happens to be weed. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope this gives others hope that you can do it. I know I have a long road ahead but this is a milestone that I wanted to stop and acknowledge.

As most people who post here are, I have been a long time lurker, mostly while I was stoned out of my trees hating on myself for smoking in the first place and trying to imagine life without weed but just couldn’t. The embrace of Mary Jane felt way too comfortable and I didn’t want to let it go.

Last night was my last smoke sesh after almost four years of daily smoking. I started to smoke back in my first year of university when I moved into residence at 18 and now I am 22 with a lot of unhappiness and little success to show over four years. Weed took a lot from me, or at least, I LET weed take a lot from me over these years - my university degree, my friends, family members that look down on me, my money, my compassion and empathy for others, dating experiences, working out, a general social life. I did end up going back for a nursing diploma and successfully graduated, but had to take a year off from school first because I got depressed and just wanted to smoke weed every day, all day. So yeah... little to show for it. And I’m just so unhappy with this routine of waking up, pack bowl, smoke bowl, play game, pack bowl, smoke bowl, play game, pack bowl, smoke bowl, mindless scroll on phone for hours, and it continues. Every hour, every day. It took my life over. I thought I needed it to function. But after looking back at how I did function high, I’m trying to figure out what the fuck I was thinking. I’m sure when I’m deeper into this quitting, my brain will be thinking otherwise that weed is the best thing for me. But right now, I’m just confused on why I would want to do this routine and feel this way for the rest of my life, hardly leaving my house. 

I don’t love weed anymore and I realized that after I read posts here, relating to so many of the negatives: the anxieties, the brain fog, etc. I am ready to be me again. I’m ready to get my real sense of humour back, maybe get back to dating. Who knows? I have no idea what a life sober looks like anymore. But I’m ready to see.


So, today is day 1. After a couple of day 1’s already, I still feel motivated and good about this one. I’ve never posted on this sub before so I’m hoping that it will give me some accountability and keep me strong through urges and shit.

In the past, I usually found I was very tired for the first two or three days, and had more vivid dreams. I don’t really think I am a heavy smoker; I smoke less than 0.5 grams flower in a joint nightly. I first started smoking for help with PTSD. It seemed to help me snap out of being triggered/ anger which we often happen at night. Almost all the time, I would be triggered by my wife - I have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and violence, so it’s unfortunate but understandable that tight relationships can really bring out some demons. Getting high would help me be more objective about the days events and help me be more empathetic to my wife. Despite being on cocktail of meds, ganja has really been the only thing that was immediately successful in snapping me out of a triggered state. 

I have gotten a lot better and now I don’t get triggered all that much. But the habit has stuck around, and I admit it helps me deal with boredom. I am not working right now due to ptsd, and having had it in the first place was pretty isolating, socially. 

I do have to quit if I go back to work as I will be drug tested. I have looked on the web for a protocol on how to taper off, which I think would be the best for me as my brain can be fragile.

I recently made it 16 days without smoking. I also recently got back together with an ex girlfriend who is not for marijuana at all.
16 days. The longest break I have taken since I started 12 years ago. 12 years of everyday smoking all day and night. It got to the point where I am not always smoking to get high and have fun but instead to drown out some of my issues and thoughts. I actually did start to feel better and more clear after just 2 weeks but I guess sitting at home with the virus going around made me go a little nuts. I am a very productive stoner and I would say it doesn't effect me like it may others. I own 2 business and workout out regularly even while stoned. I smoked 2 times in the last week while my girlfriend has moved in during these weird times in the world and that has brought our relationship to a standstill. 

My question to my reddit fam is... have you ever been in a relationship where marijuana is pretty much a big deciding factor if you will have a healthy relationship? I'm fighting with this so much right now. Do I quit completely to be with her just because she doesn't like it?

I do want to stop the habit of wanting to smoke all day and all night but I think it's unrealistic that marijuana will be out of my life forever. Is that just my habit talking to me?

Two days in with a total of five hours sleep.,"*I plan to quit for good. I really don't think I need to explicitly state that repeatedly, but so be it. The part in italics is simply to introduce my post and make it clear I am planning to quit for good. I really want some feedback on this and feel I am being true to the mission of* r/leaves 

If you have quit due to the virus what were your reasons? How are you holding up?

So I have smoked for a long time and have taken many extended breaks (some for tolerance and some just cuz). My last extended break was three weeks straddling November and December.

I got laid off on Thursday and stopped by a store on my way home from work (I'm Canadian).

I smoked a bunch on Friday and Saturday then called it quits with a little spliff on Sunday.

Here are the reasons why I decided to quit now.

1. Since weed got legalized my dealer disappeared so my option is to buy from stores or online. I have no idea if or when the legal options will close and wanted to control the timing of the withdrawal symptoms.
2. The legal stuff ain't cheap. I was probably spending $300 a month. I was fine with that when I was working, but with the layoff and absolutely no idea when I'll work again I gotta conserve my cash.
3. Weight. I'm stuck in my condo about 23 hours a day. I do not want to be in here with the munchies for weeks or months on end.
4. My friendly neighbourhood store scares me for social distancing. They have a narrow entrance way with a little area to sit before you go into the main store. They have like an old school bankers window set up when you walk in the entrance that they are selling out of due to the social distancing requirements. Unfortunately, my fellow customers don't get the social distancing thing. When I was at the store on Sunday the owner told me they were going to come up with something.
5. Lung health. This virus attacks the respiratory system. Probably really smart to not willingly harm my lungs at this time.

All that being said I may try buying some edibles before going completely cold turkey. Sleep has been brutal for me. I think I have gotten a total of five hours sleep the last two nights combined. I will go to my local store and see if they have any edibles. I'll get there early so as to avoid the potential for contact.",4,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 2, 'distancing': 3}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6669116}"

This is relevant later. Last night I dreamed my first dream I can recall in 2 (!!) years.


The Dream: I'm waiting on my porch for something, I don't yet know what, but I know I'm waiting.. An ex-boss of mine rolls up, and comes up to the porch. Hands me two big bags of weed and demands $100. Shocked (ex-boss didn't toke, nevermind sell) I hand it over and he quickly leaves. I look down at the bags of weed and and think ""why did I buy this?"" with disappointment in my heart. The next thought was, ""it's OK, it'll be nice to have around""...  But then the weed begins to decompose before my eyes, being eaten/recycled by saprophytic fungi. It was wild and borderline pyschedelic watching these two bags of weed be consumed by the fungi.


What I am taking from the dream: I like how I was disappointed in myself for buying weed in the dream, but am taking as a warning my next thought of being pleased to have it around. I've made some personal progress with 9 days sober, but have much work to do, so I must remain vigilant. 


I am also very thankful to fungi... For what they do for almost every being on Earth.. they are the great recyclers of our world and are the interface of death/rebirth. I feel like the weed being eaten by the fungi in my dream was a symbol of rebirth or renewal without weed.

I don't think about weed very much anymore (with everything going on it's crossed my mind once or twice, but I haven't even had a \*craving\* in 2 weeks). It's so freeing to not have my routine based around it... I spent so much time just thinking about weed, planning games/TV/meals around weed so I could ""enjoy it more high,"" at work just thinking about going home and smoking weed... so glad that's all behind me.

Sleep is great, dreams are great. I developed a phobia of dreaming because for 5 years, the only time I dreamed was during a short T-break and I'd get those terrible vivid nightmares. Now my dreams are just long strange adventures. Every time I dream I feel a bit of my creativity coming back to me. My muse has been drugged into silence for so long, but she's coming back to life.

I established some good habits, made an effort to get out of the house more and see family more and exercise more, I was really kind of feeling like a rockstar till this pandemic shut everything in my city down. But I'm doing OK in isolation, not tempted at all, and I'm glad that I'm actually able to progress on some projects now and not waste all day being faded, anxious, and high.

Oh... I stopped drinking coffee too. I think that's also been helpful for sleep/anxiety. It's crazy to think about that cycle now: I would smoke a joint to feel creative but it would make me lazy, so then I'd drink coffee to feel productive but it would make me anxious, so I'd smoke again to feel relaxed, but then I'd be foggy so I'd drink coffee again... In the end I'd be foggy and anxious and nothing would get done. no wonder I couldn't sleep!

I'm so grateful I committed to quitting. The only downside is I haven't hung out with my stoner friends in a month and I miss them, but that just creates space for better friendships with better influences down the road.

Nothing really seems to help, like deep breathing or putting my face in cold water. It isn't constant but it seems like it's getting worse, always at very random times when I don't feel any emotional change or other trigger. Even right now, I'm lying on the couch watching TV and I suddenly feel my heart thundering so badly it's hard to pay attention. (Not sure if relavent but my fingers also usually get cold when this happens.)

It was about 70mg by the end of the night which I hadn't noticed, especially since I had only planned on eating 40mg. I felt so twitchy and uncomfortable by the end of the night I just let myself pass out pretty early, defeating the point of me even wanting to party. It just was awful, I binge ate so much food that this morning I almost puked i was still so full, I felt like a 100lb weight had been directly placed on my brain, my eyes and body hurts, and this haze is almost too much to handle. I feel like I'm a quarter of the person I was yesterday. 

But my point is, is that I never noticed the hangovers. I never noticed how much I never felt like myself after a night like that. I thought I feel so empty inside after not dreaming as I slept (or not being able to remember them, whatever you wanna say) and that hurts. I loved being able to dream again. Yesterday when I woke up I was so surprised I dreamt all night I almost wept. It was so nice to be able to feel that human experience, to feel like I didnt just not exist for hours. But to feel like I was in the place of being alive, not to just lay there and feel dead. I missed that today probably the most. I missed having my own fun as I slept and now I just feel hallow. Like something is missing and I hate this feeling. I never want to wake up to feel like this again. I never want to wake up and not feel like me again. Even with liquor (which I cant drink now a days cause of kidney problems) I never quite had this feeling of hallowness. I just need to take this as the lesson this is and remember the shitty things about it. Not the immediate dopamine rush that covers up all my insecurities and problems, but that it kills me to do that and to let myself go like that. I have found that I really do like myself, even after years of self destructive behavior and selfishness, I do like myself, for who I really am. I dont want to do this again and lose myself. 

I guess that is my point, I dont like being lost and scared. I like myself how I am, and i dont need a drug to change me for the worst.

We used it to soothe mental health challenges (i have PTSD and i suspect he might have it too, at  minimum he has Anxiety).   


In light of COVID-19 and our own frustration with the habit, we're wining our usage down slowly to avoid a massive spike in mental health symptoms.   


I'm now onto half a J per day. He's quitting tobacco slowly too (an average 2 cigarettes a day and half a joint per day). So far, so good. But now I'm wondering, for me (just smoking weed), how long does it take for your lungs to 'recover'? And for him (he was never a heavy cigarette smoker), how long for him? What symptoms did you experience with your withdrawals? Anything help you with it? i.e. vitamin c, exercise, sleep, etc.   


To inform those answers or gues-stimations, previously I smoked up to 3 joints per day for a time (pure weed), and he'd have up to 7 cigarettes per day on average, and 2 joints per day.   
Drinking was never an issue. We just smoked.

2020-03-23 11:31:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fnlvbm/day_12_the_quarantine_quit/,Day 12 ~ The Quarantine Quit,"In the sea of noise that is the news right now, I feel grateful that this period of isolation is giving me the tools I needed to leave weed behind. I live in NYC, and for the past week, my girlfriend and I have been staying with her folks up in rural Connecticut to weather the Coronavirus storm.


Being away from my apartment and paraphernalia has been immensely helpful in mitigating the cravings I have felt (and the relapses I have had) all the other times I have tried to kick this habit. It's like a mini weed-free retreat, and I have been able to focus on what is really important to me up here. My health, my girlfriend, and being around other people who care about each other. 


Another huge help in this period is this community, and I wanted to write this post to try to give back to someone who might be starting, or restarting like me, their journey to weed sobriety. Seeing what y'all go through, the symptoms you report, and the way your brains are coping has been very comforting. So far, I feel like I am doing better than ever before and that this time has real potential to be the last time I quit. 


I'm 27, and have been a daily weed smoker more or less for the past 5 years. It hasn't been easy. I feel extremely sluggish, and have been having intense bouts of heartburn on random days ever since I stopped. I've never been a crier, but on day 5 I let loose a deluge of tears and what felt like 5 years of pent up emotions. This whole experience has been very cathartic, and I couldn't do it alone. Transition to some random tips for anyone looking to walk down the path from an internet stranger:


*If you can, let someone know what you're going through.* 
My girlfriend has been immensely supportive throughout this whole time, checking in on me, letting me know she supports what I am doing and why I am doing it, and I know I couldn't do it without her. Alone, I am weak to my cravings. But with her support, I know I can power through. 


*Get away from or get rid of your 'stuff'.*
That dope bong you bought and love smoking out of? Get it out of your sight. Lucky lighter? Bye. Your stash, remove it from your household. Make it impossible to cave to your urges. When I feel an itch coming on, it's reassuring to know that I would be extremely hard pressed to come by some weed right now. 


*Keep a journal.*
If nothing else, keep a record of your symptoms. That way, when you feel some new pain or itch or in my case that old bastard heartburn, you have a point of comparison from one, two or even 12 weeks ago. 


*Do productive things.*
Not only does this take your mind of the devil's lettuce, it feels really good after 5 years of sitting on my ass watching YouTube to actually contribute to the world. This weekend, the lady and I helped her parents all around their yards, prepping small farm plots, planting, gardening, and installing a small pond. The fresh air and the sense of accomplishment is a great rush.

I’m in Cali so my school has been out for about a week now, no word of senior ball or graduation continuing so I’ve just been cooped inside either my room or my work. You know we’re all in this together, so that gives me solace; however, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t expect this year to unfold differently. What can you do tho? Not much. So with all this pent up frustration and anger I decided to go for a run, and I ran the farthest I ever have in my entire life - without stopping. Feels great. I can’t decide if it’s the motivation, the sobriety, or a combination of both but I enjoy feeling strong. That’s all I have for today. I guess my message is, even though we work towards these big accomplishments with grand finales, sometimes a simple activity can be all it takes to feel that same emotion of pride. I’m glad that of all the places in the world to be “Quarantined” I am blessed to be cooped In the sunshine state itself. Bless you all.

When I first started smoking, it was usually only done on occasion (friend gatherings, parties, etc) and always had a good time. I found myself buying weed every week after a year, to every 2-3 days, to every night before bed. The reason I am quitting is because I feel as it has taken control over my life and has gotten in the way of things. I am at the point where I’m always craving it when I’m not high, especially whenever I am under lots of stress. I got so used to being high all the time that it became a “normal” feeling, and would always think nothing of it. I feel like weed has made me depressed personally for the fact that  i am always constantly thinking about my “old” “sober” self that was always naturally high off life and was always happy before I started smoking. I went from having those fun highs to the paranoid highs where I always have negative thoughts, constantly think about why i need to quit and how it is affecting my life negatively. Listed below are the reasons why i am quitting weed.

1. Tired/lazy/unmotivated all the time 
2. Brain fog
3. No drive
4. unsocial especially when high 
5. short-term memory loss
6. Anxiety from weed 
7. Feeling overwhelmed by chores/tasks
8. depression from lack of identifying self-personality

Stay strong! If you're reading this while in the midst of thinking of quitting, NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO START. In the beginning you have to structure your day and fill it up with stuff to be doing ALL the time. I really believe quitting is possible for anyone when you break it down to manageable time goals. Everyone can handle not smoking for 10 minutes. If you can do that, you can find ways to navigate your way through each 10 minutes of the first day. Then you've got a day under your belt. Then you've got two. By the time you hit a few months you start to notice that a few DAYS went by and you didn't even remember to mark down that you hadn't used THC because you were busy doing better things. 

Also keep in mind that we're stoners. We'll always love being stoned, so don't wait around for something to magically make you fall out of love, or to love it a little less so you get your usage to a normal level. You gotta accept that you're different from your friends that can use it and still get everything they want accomplished. That probably ain't you or you wouldn't be reading this. Hang in there!

Context: I am a 20 year old male who started smoking heavily in early 2019 to alleviate anxiety. Took a T break in the summer after smoking every day for probably 5 months. Then around fall of 2019, resumed smoking heavily until December 13, then on and off smoked heavily while fighting addiction to help my mental health.

I'm on day 8 and it's my third and hopefully last time quitting this plant.

The first week I was really shocked at how few typical side effects I got withdrawing from weed - no night sweats, more manageable insomnia, and a decreased appetite but nothing like the nausea I felt after my first ""real"" quit around December. I was really feeling pretty decent, and then this morning, that old familiar morning anxiety greeted me from the pit of my stomach. I'm not anxious about anything in particular, just generally anxious. 

At this point, it's probably also worth mentioning I started Zoloft in late December for anxiety and depression, and the drug has helped with both of those immensely. But the reason I'm quitting weed is that weed makes me anxious no matter what, and I know anxiety is a withdrawal symptom I have had in the past, but I really just want somebody to tell me that anxiety has randomly popped up in their recovery and that in time I'll be reaping the full benefits of the meds while also clean of weed.

I’m a 20yo male, been smoking since I was 17. Over the three years, weed has been a major part of my life. I started because all my friends were doing it in school, then my first serious relationship ended and for a long time I felt upset about it and used weed to cope. In the mean time, I started university and moved away from my parents, which gave me a lot more freedom and I started smoking more often and bought a bong. 

After that, things started going a bit downhill. I had started buying in bulk and selling to friends at cost so we can all get cheaper weed. About 6 months into university, some of my “friends” end up stealing multiple ounces of weed from me, and that was troubling. I stopped buying in bulk and selling to friends, and started evaluating it rationally thinking about where my life has come.

This was in 2018. Between then and now, I have lurked this subreddit a lot. I have tried quitting multiple times but couldn’t last longer than a few weeks. However I did quit smoking cigarettes. 

The problem is, I’m productive despite my smoking habits. Of course I’m way more productive when I’m not smoking , but I’m “just enough” productive to take care of school, work, and my personal life even when smoking everyday. 

I’ve reduced a lot, come down to 1-2 joints a day, from 5-10 bowls a day. And it feels like my brain keeps telling me to fully quit as it’s not helpful, and I know all the reasons why, but when I’m off it I just have the urge to celebrate finishing a task or “relaxing” for a while.

Whenever I’ve quit, I usually get back on it as a way to celebrate some achievement - but then in a couple days time I’m smoking regularly again. Also, I find myself hitting the gym regularly when I’m sober but when I start smoking I usually stop going and get back on fast food instead of cooking.

I stopped drinking at the same time as smoking, and had a pretty bad alcoholic withdrawal to go with it, and also stopped nicotine and caffeine so can’t directly relate my experience to everyone else as i’m going through my own extreme idiosyncratic withdrawal but I can proudly say that when I’ve smelt the smelly smell in public now, it doesn’t smell the same to me anymore. It smells foreign to me now, the way it did before I smoked it. No craving.

I had my own withdrawal from weed that lasted about 10 days which included insomnia, panic attacks, lockjaw, and song loops stuck in my head. 

Of course, i was an alcohol and weed user simultaneously, and got simultaneously addicted to both- so working AA has helped tremendously. Now that the rona has hit I’ve preemptively called my home aa office for a chip in the mail (as my stop drinking date lags behind my stop smoking date by exactly 5 days.)

There’s got to be some divine providence that got me to stop these substances before the social isolation of the virus hit. If not I’d be detoxing like a bitch in the worst of times.

I’m definitely still in PAWS, which is 100% real, but its gotten way way better than the first 2 months, which were a living hell of panic attacks, twitching, muscle spasms, etc etc etc.

I got the PAWS anxiety and random muscle tightness and brain fog that people like u/pawsleaves have talked about. I’ve been totally open with my doctor and a psychologist about this. I’ve been reconnecting with my faith too just to throw the book at this.

Things are infinitely better than the first two months, but are getting better veeeeerrry slowly.

I’ve read on this forum some people talking about things clearing up for them at 4 months, 6 months, a year, 18 months, 2 years, etc— so I just have to not smoke (or drink) and be a living testament to those fighting through PAWS. I believe just sitting back, and not smoking will deliver me through.

I would love tips, tricks, advice, literature suggestion, podcast suggestion, and shared experiences from those who have made it through. Of course, i feel many who feel better don’t bother to revisit this forum.

2020-03-21 16:52:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fmma05/yesterday_ive_quit_weed_for_good/,Yesterday i've quit weed for good,"I'm 24, and was 18 the first time I smoked weed.

I've been smoking occasionally, and 2 year and 3 months ago it became a daily habit.

Since then I've tried to quit a few times and failed.


&nbsp;


At first I enjoyed it, it took a while until it became a problem.

But I guess I just like weed too much. I used it too much and got to a point that I knew it was better for me to quit. But it became increasingly hard.

I've tried and failed, it was so hard that I knew I had to throw away all the weed and everything related to it in order to stop using it.


&nbsp;


And then a few weeks\months later, I forgot how bad weed was for me and I tried it once on the weekend with friends.

It was so much fun that I did it again. And then you start looking for ways to get your hands on weed - meeting with friends who smoke, and if they don't bring weed with them your evening is practically ruined, you just can't keep your mind on something else.

The chase after weed consumes alot of your time and then again you're buying you're own weed.
And again it starts fun, and slowly becomes a problem.


&nbsp;


This cycle has been going on for the last 2 years and 3 months.

I think I must have thrown all my weed about 3 or 4 times, always telling myself I'll never use it again.
And each time my problem with weed just kept getting worse.

It became harder to stop - the withdrawal effects became worse.

I was more depressed, anxious, irritated without weed.

The memory and cognitive damage became worse.


&nbsp;


And the months and years goes by, I can't move forward in life, I consume more and more weed daily.
2 months ago I was quitting weed for over a month.

But then I got my own apartment and could now smoke weed whenever I wanted to.

I got back to smoke weed and rapidly increased the amount, sometimes 3 or more times a day. All day.


&nbsp;


Now, I'm lucky to have a lot in my life.

I have an amazing very high paying job that's also interesting.

I have friends, I've overcome social anxiety which I had as a teenager.

I've had a girlfriend, I have a great family. I was working out, taking care of myself, and I actually look really good.

I moved away from my parents and rents my own apt.

I'm successful, I've achieved many things in my life that I'm proud of, I'm highly motivated and smart.

I'm ambiguous AF. I'm setting my goals as high as you could imagine. I have amazing plans for my life and I'm happy with my current life.

I believe I can truly success. Be rich. Have the most amazing girl and house.

I think I can influence and make the world significantly better. That's my goal in life.


&nbsp;


And even with my addiction to weed I could still keep it all together.

But it disturbs me badly how much more I could have achieved by now.

And it's terrifying how as time goes by I feel like I can't seem to manage my addiction, and my weed problem become bigger and bigger and start to really threaten my condition.

And right now I feel like I'm on the edge, continuing this habit will put what I already got in life at risk.

If I'll hurt my own well-being for something stupid as weed addiction. Or my health. Or make my life worse and ruin my hard work - that would devastate me.


&nbsp;


I MUST QUIT WEED IMMEDIATELY.


&nbsp;


I know that it will be hard. In the last month I've smoked about a gram a day.

I've already tried and failed many times.

The last couple of weeks I've decided yet again to quit weed.

I slowly shifted from thinking that weed is both a problem and a thing that I liked, to look at weed at something which is just bad.

If you're trying for two years to stop using weed or manage your addiction, and no matter what you promise to yourself you keep losing control, that's when you start seeing it as a pure bad thing.

Weed is the opposite of fun for me right now.

And this is what caused me to decide to quit weed for good.

I realized that I can't control myself when I have it in my house.

the only way to keep me away from it is to throw it away, and so I did yesterday.


&nbsp;


I know that this time I must succeed not trying it again. NEVER buying it again. Otherwise, I would have to seek some professional help.

Otherwise, there would be real harsh consequences for my life.


&nbsp;


So here I am quitting cold turkey.

No weed. No tobacco which I used to mix with my weed.

Not even alcohol for the near future because it had me to relapse in the past.

I know that i'm going to experience hell.

And I'm willing to go through it for good no matter how long it will take.


&nbsp;


I've been planning my quitting for a few weeks now, I have a strategy and a plan and I really am ready to give up on weed and everything that it means.

I will feel cravings. I will be depressed. I will be annoyed and angry. I wouldn't be able to concentrate.

In the upcoming days\weeks I will probably be even dumber than when I smoked weed.

The lack of dopamine and serotonin are going to make me suffer.

It will make me not think clearly, even worse than it was when I was high.


&nbsp;


But I know that it is a wave that will pass.

As long as I won't smoke weed again, time will pass and I will find myself after this wave as a healthy person with no dependencies.

If I would smoke weed, I'm not only going back to the starting point, but now the symptoms of the withdrawal will be even worse.


&nbsp;


There is going to be a period of time of about 2-3 months until THC is completely out of my body and fat cells.
But thinking that I can clean myself completely excites me as hell.

I want to be healthy again.

The realization that my lungs would slowly restore in the next few weeks and I'll be able to get back to working out - which will further improve my mental health is a gift that I value.

I've decided to take my life back.


&nbsp;


What I'm most looking forward to is getting my cognitive function back.

I'm highly talented and smart person. I work in a tech company as a senior developer and researcher, I always had strong brain.

Well today I'm mediocre at best, and not suitable at times.

I have severely damaged my memory function and learning capabilities and it damages my work and my career goals in an unacceptable way.

I know that it will probably take more than just 3 months, cause even when THC is out of my system, it might take longer for my mental health to stabilize.


&nbsp;


My brain needs to overcome here a pretty large trauma - baking my brain cells each day for over 2 years. Sometimes even 3 or 4 or 5 times a day.


&nbsp;


My brain will have to learn to do new things that it haven't done in years.

Such as everything that related to start feeling again and start coping and managing all those feelings.
Like a child that needs to learn how to live life again.


&nbsp;


My brain will also have to learn how to store memories again.

It will finally have a good sleep with no interference from THC.

It might take some time Until I'll be back to the cognitive abilities I've had before.

Maybe even there is some permanent damage.

But the brain is elastic and changing, and my work demands to always learn new things and grasp complex new concepts.

And I believe that a few months of sobriety, of learning, of good sleep and nutrition, can rebuild it.

It might take a year, maybe more, but that is the only way I'm heading right now.


&nbsp;


The first few months will be tough, but to finally have to cope with all my problems will be even harder.

Cope with feelings of depression. With all sorts of unpleasant feelings.

This struggle is something that I'll do for the rest of my life. No more escapes.

This is part of the human experience.

Coping with such feelings is something that I haven't done in years, and I'll have to learn again how to effectively do it.

And dealing with it is so much better than actively damaging your life.


&nbsp;


I'm prepared to all of this. I wrote down many different strategies on what to do when cravings starts.

I'll take a shower, drink tea, meditation really helps me when my mind is rushing and I can't think clear.

Go on a walk outside. Talk to a friend. See netflix.

I'll be doing new things every day, and start doing things differently.

This is key when trying to stop such a strong habit.


&nbsp;


I've started some new hobbies. I was a weed smoker so ofcourse I didn't had any hobbies.

And while I'm craving weed I'm not planning on staring at the wall.

I will need something else to keep my mind on. Just like normal people without addiction does.

So I'm learning lockpicking now, I'm playing a video game, I'm watching science youtube videos, I will maintain a rich social circle.

My mind will be focused on work, and girls, and getting back in shape and doing house chores. I'm starting to actually live my life not through a filter.


&nbsp;


The real mental discomfort and serious cravings will probably pass after a few months.

Maybe after 6 months I would be back in shape. Be able to teach my brain new things.

And the cannabinoid system and dopamine and serotonin and melatonin levels which I violently disrupted for the last 2 years, will be back to normal.

Still the connection between weed and pure joy will remain in my brain.

There would still be many things that will trigger my need for weed.

This is just how the brain functions. It remembers what caused him to fell so good and links it to situations, objects, and all sort of stuff.

The struggle not to smoke is a constant one. But It's possible.


&nbsp;


The struggle to wake up and get out of bad is also a constant one.

Such as the struggle not to punch someone in the face when he annoys you or the struggle not to eat that extra piece of cake.

Our brains have strong connection to good experiences, it stores it for a long time.

But it can't remember something forever.

And after years of not smoking, and not doing what linked with smoking, and having a shitload of other great happy and enjoyable memories, it will eventually get rid of that old weed fun memories.

And with time the appeal of smoking will be gone.

It will take years, maybe a decade, maybe more. But in the end of it after slow process you come out a different man.


&nbsp;


And this is all what quitting weed smoking addiction is - becoming a different person.

With different lifestyle. Different friends if your friends are smoking weed.

Different behaviors and different thinking patterns. Different habits. Different brain.


&nbsp;


I've been smoking weed daily for 2 years and 3 months, smoked it since more than 6 years - that's quarter of my life!

Even before as a teenager I've been drinking alcohol on my own, got myself passed out and puking in many many social gatherings.

I've stolen my mom's cigarettes when I was 13-15 years old. I was always on the chase for these things that makes you feel good artificially.

Since I was 12 and until now.

Sometimes more, sometimes less, most times it was in control. Up until recent years.


&nbsp;


I have really poor habits. Really poor coping system. Really poor self control.

And just like a child learns how to deal with life correctly, I also need to do it, and therefore I have to completely reinvent myself as a person.

If I'm not doing it I'm deemed to fail.


&nbsp;


I've changed my behavior and thinking patterns when I've decided to fight social anxiety and seen a really big improvement there.

People can change, it takes time and patience, but your brain slowly change.

You need a solid plan, you need to know your own pitfalls, you need to try and fail and learn from it, you need to research all the information you can on the internet.

And this subreddit is a great resource for it - and eventually - you'll win.


&nbsp;


I know that I'm going through actual hell, but I know that it is possible and I know that I actually doesn't have other choice.

This lifetime is the only time you get. This is it.

There are no 2nd chances or restart buttons.

I will not spend the only time I get by telling myself the lie that life can start tomorrow. Or in a year. It can't.
You don't get the privilege to spend years of your life sitting in your couch and smoking weed.

You can't just halt your life and not make progress for years, not learning new things for years, not coping with the problems that every human has to cope with.

""Wouldn't it be great to find some inspiration and creativity by smoking?""

""You could feel better and pass the time by smoking.""

I know goddamn well that smoking gives me no long term benefits, but these thoughts just keep creeping in. 

Oh well, though. There's nothing to do but embrace them, feel them, acknowledge them. I'm not going to smoke. I'm going to wrestle this thoughts into submission and continue on my path forward.

That same day I smoked myself into oblivion at night and have been doing it every day since. What changed my perspective was after a talk with my father today when I kept saying ""I have been smoking weed for 2 or 3 years"" in conversation when we were talking about my weed consumption. He responded with ""not 2 or 3, but 4"". For some reason, that number really hit me... 4 years!? Time goes by fast, 4 years ago I was a little 15-year-old sophomore now I am a sophomore in college. I literally looked like a child at that age, and that hurts me to realize that I smoked when I was that young. In what ways could I have been stunted (height, mental-toughness, work-ethic) in those 4 important years of maturation. It caused me to reflect and realize that though everybody always says you have the power to make choices, you really do. If I made the choice at that age to not smoke like all my friends, I could have flourished into a happy and situated human being, rather than feeling broken. And as I am predisposed to anxiety, my brain now wants me to obsess over all the things that would have gone different if I did not smoke all those 4 years, which I got caught in for an hour after our conversation. I felt hopeless... like I threw away 4 years of development and life for momentary short-term benefit. But then I thought about my next 4 years, and how I have the power to transform those to create the person I want to become. So when I look back at 24 I will no longer lament my losses, but be proud of the improvements I made.

You are more fragile than you think. Your health is more important now than ever before. You don't have as much control over yourself and your life as you thought you did. 

Don't let weed control you, too. Allow yourself to exercise control over what you can control, and allow yourself to roll with the changes of what you can't control. 

Things might be crazy right now, but you are not crazy. You are a person and you deserve to give yourself a fighting chance through anything life throws at you.

If you're going through anxiety and searching this sub to see if it might be the weed, chances are it's a contributing factor. Take a long, hard look at your use and your goals during this trying time and give yourself a fighting chance. Focus on yourself, your family, your health, and your future.

I started smoking heavily my first month at University. I had smoked previously in high school but only a total of two or three times. Made a mistake that ended up with me getting caught up. This led to me swearing off weed for the 10 months leading up to University, but once I got to Uni I made some new friends that were ""heavily involved in the herb"" and was reintroduced. After this smoking almost immediately became a daily habit. A bowl to start the morning, a joint between classes to take the edge off, and at night I would sit in the same spot toking for hours. Initially, I didn't notice any detrimental effects. But as I finished my first semester failing all but one of my classes I knew I had a developing issue. This acknowledgment didn't stop me, though. Throughout the next semester I would begin to smoke even more heavily, as at this point it was ""helping"" me cope with the stressful situation I had put myself in by smoking. It was around the end of this second semester (completely failed my classes and withdrew from the school after that first year) that I began to really notice the subtle consequences of smoking in excess weren't so subtle anymore.

I began to withdraw from my friend groups. If they didn't smoke weed, it was highly unlikely we would hangout. I had been through a number of jobs, never lasting more than two months as I would under perform because of the haze I would describe as my ""sober"" state. I would find excuses to avoid gatherings, opting to instead stay home and get baked until I couldn't move from the couch. My relationship with my parents began to dissolve, and by the end of it the only people I felt comfortable around were my smoking buddies. No motivation, no resolve or drive to do the things I knew needed to get done. It had consumed my life to a large degree and smoking weed became my personality. The biggest negative impact I experienced though was the deterioration of my social ability. I went from being a funny, quick-witted, jubilant guy to someone who struggled to string together sentences. When people would talk to me, I would completely zone out of the conversation and start thinking about whatever came to mind until it was my turn to respond and I had to either come up with something random or give the default laugh and accompanying, ""yeah I feel you on that."" (I did not feel them on that, I didn't even fucking hear them).

I'm 21 now and nothing has changed. The past three years have been a daze, with the side effects I listed above only getting worse. I attempted many times before to quit but would relapse in under a week consistently. However, as of last week I was laid off of my job due to the Corona virus and since I live with my grandparents and (older) parents I decided to self-isolate so as not to risk spreading it to them. This has put me in a position where I feel confident that I can finally stop my abuse of weed altogether. Writing this on my third day sober and so far it has not been enjoyable to say the least. Heavy cravings, nausea and an complete inability to fall asleep, but I am determined that this time will be THE time. The only thing that worries me is my uncertainty of what quitting will actually accomplish. I know that everybody is different but if anyone can give me and idea of what to expect in the coming weeks / months I would be grateful. Also most importantly to anyone that has experienced a dip in their social skills, I would love to know if that will ever come back or if i'm destined to be a walking gaffe forever. Much love and good luck!

I graduated high school and made my way into life. I was a heavy pot smoker at the time. 

Early May 2019 -  Had a severe marijuana induced panic attack bad enough to where I looked at my cuz and said ""If I was alone, I'd kill myself"" and I really fucking meant it. That was terrifying but not as bad as the long term affects that it had. 

End of May 2019 - Graduated from HS, was told I cant get into college. 

From that point on, it got extremely bad. I knew I was experiencing this feeling because of the weed but I couldn't stop smoking it. Around this time, I was also diagnosed with Costochondritis (inflammation in the chest) which basically mimics heart attack like pains and shortness of breath. I still have this condition to this day and I don't think it'll ever go way. Anyway 

I'll describe the feeling of what I felt like. I just found an exact term for it (according to symptoms and other research. Obviously this is self diagnosed seeing that it has gotten better as of 2020. Some of you may recognize this right away because apparently its fairly common but this was the worse experience of my life and I can 100% say I came out of this situation as a completely different person. 

I felt like everything wasn't real. Like my thoughts and memories were not mine. I felt as if I was watching my life as a movie and I couldn't get out of it. There were times where my skin felt fake, like it just was plastic or something. I couldn't take medication because I ""knew"" if I did it would kill me, I couldn't sleep because I felt like it I did I would have died. I couldn't preform simple tasks (dishes, laundry, ect.) Because I was terrified that everything I was doing was leading me one step closer to inevitable doom. On top of this, I also sat panicked about my chest hurting thinking it could be a heart attack. 

Finally, by getting out of the house and doing things a bit differently. I snapped out of it. It also took 2 doctors to prove my diagnoses about the chest condition. 

I can almost for sure say that I experienced what most people refer to as ""Depersonalization"" and ""Derealization"" I have come to the conclusion that it was between these two together or psychosis. 

When I say this is the worst experience of my life, I truly mean that this tops every single horrifying experience that I've ever had (and I watched my father die at age 14) 

Does anyone else have any experience like this that they could share so I fell less alone? It would be greatly appreciated. ♡",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8685822}"

The start of my junior year, I became an owner of my first wax pen. I didn’t think much of it, was not using it daily. Eventually second semester of my junior year came, and I got another wax pen after my original one running out for a while. And slowly and surely, I grew into a routine. Come home from swim practice, eat dinner, smoke, take a shower, eat munchies, go to sleep, and doing all again the next day. And everything seemed fine, for hells sakes I managed to get straight A’s while taking 4 AP classes and 2 honors classes, and no one knew I was doing any of this. Not even my closest friends. And the trend continued in the summer with more and more smoking, and more and more of keeping it from my friends. I couldn’t tell you much from that summer because it was all just a blur sadly. Then came my senior year and water polo practices started, and I stopped smoking because of it. Then I got injured again, and right back to old habits. That all changed on October 13th,2019, when I went cold turkey. When I started to quit, I had insane amounts of anxiety.  All of my emotions came bursting out and I had no idea of how to deal with them after being so numb for so long. After a couple of weeks passing, it started to normalize, and I started realizing who I was again, my standards, morals, and my friends. And I realized all the things I’ve lost in between the months of February and October. It took me a lot of time to get back on my feet after that, but I did it. Then New Year’s Eve came and I relapsed. I was able to control smoking to only once a week for three months. And 2 weeks ago, I have gone cold turkey again.
I realized that I am not me when I smoke. I have so much greater potential then waking up like a fucking airhead everyday. At the starts of January, I started to feel like me again. I was having so much fun, being so adventurous, not giving a fuck, and just having a fucking blast all the time. I realized that I am looking for happiness, however I was looking at a short term solution to bring me happiness, weed. I really wanted a long and sustainable way of happiness, which can be achieved by mhm through relationships and self love.

And now we are here today, with the Coronavirus outbreak. All my senior events are probably gonna be cancelled, school is probably gonna be cancelled, I don’t get to spend my last months with all the friends I’ve made in high school, I can’t go visit my colleges, and I am a sad, almost on the verge of crying. If I was still smoking, I don’t think I’d get anywhere near crying. In the last three months, I have learned so much about myself, have come to peace with myself, have made so many fucking friends, and have become genuinely so happy. 

Hopefully I make my streak this time last longer than the last, but I’ll take it day by day;)
Thank you all for reading and today, I will not smoke with you!",2,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39318573}"

This is why it’s so hard to stop.

Don’t think for a second our love for weed is a problem. Our problem is that the world we live in, the relationships we keep, and our personal ambitions (whatever they may be) are not conducive to a weed habit.

We can choose to remain in our citadels of weed use or we can live in the low-rises of the real world amongst our friends and enemies. For some people weed works for them and their ambitions. They can smoke daily and be absolutely FINE, and the saddest thing is realizing that this drug just isn’t for us.

I decided I should start taking my Pot habit seriously and see how long I can keep this sobriety going. Luckily most of the physical symptoms have calmed down but I’m still having trouble sleeping/eating. I feel fine overall though besides the lack of sleep and food tasting kind of shitty. I guess I’m just here to share my experiences and also ask for some Advice. 
Some of the benefits I’ve found from my pot sobriety have been: I feel more in touch with my friends/family and really just reality in general. I’m much more lively and social(except for the Times when my lack of sleep gets to me but I’m sure that’ll improve over time), I feel this overall feeling of clarity and being in control, and the obvious thank you from my wallet
Cons of quitting: 
Physical withdrawal symptoms(temporary)
Strain on Social relationships that revolve around smoking(although personally I don’t mind chilling with someone while they’re smoking when I’m not, it’s not like alcohol were the person gets belligerent after a certain amount)
Music has not been sounding as good as it did(this one is a huge one and probably a pillar of why I’m such a stoner, the type of music I listen 2 is very commonly enhanced by weed or other drugs and many argue that you need to be high to listen to it, although I definitely disagree I can admit that I haven’t reached a certain level of euphoria from music while sober that I have while high) 

So I guess my questions are:
How does a temporary t break turn into permanently quitting?
If you relate to what I said about music, how did you cope with that? Did you have to switch genres? 
Is it even worth going permanently sober off of pot? Or is it fine to do occasionally as long as a habit isn’t formed?
When will I start being able to sleep again?

Second day weedfree, actually been like 50 hours. It was okay... Honestly not bad. My first night of sleep was not bad either. Had 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I did make sure to be busy and use my body a lot during the day to be sure I could sleep. And it worked.

My morning was pretty serene and at work I did get more agitated than usual. But guess what? The feeling passed. I also had a harder time with focusing and keeping an overview. But I also found myself being more active. Standing at my desk instead of sitting all day and sometimes running to my collegues in another room instead of walking :p. Also, I left later than usual and was scared I miss the train. Normally I definitely would just take my time instead but now I pushed myself to bike superfast and run up and down the stairs to the platform and I made it! So thats a small win of the day.

I want to be able to enjoy life without having to be on cloud nine, I want to be focused and find ways to stay dedicated. I love to draw, read, play sports and do new things, but I feel like I can’t even be at my best if I’m not high and for that reason I wish to stop myself from getting deeper into this drugged up lifestyle.

  Another reason is less for myself and more for my relationship... me and my girlfriend have been together for nearly 3 years and she’s been around for my lowest points in life. Theres been so much shit I’ve put her through since I’ve picked up a blunt, so much that she had to go through without my full support, so much from the past I wish I could change. For her the weed wasn’t always an issue, she never told me to stop at first and she was actually just very supportive because of the situation I was in and I’ve taken her support for granted, I’ve lied, I made myself distant from her, and I’ve hurt her with words so many times. BUT she’s still as supportive as she’s ever been, so for her as much as it is for me, I just have to stop this now, today.

I came home from college today cause of COVID-19 and I decided to leave all my weed stuff at home or give it to my roommate to use because I'm forcing myself to not smoke at home. Originally I was thinking about stopping smoking over the summer, but with us being sent home I thought I should add these two months as well. However, I've been doing some thinking and have come to the conclusion that if I could stop for 5 months, what is to stop me from doing a year. And at a year  I might as well see if I can get to two years. And I realized that what's stopping me is fear. I've been smoking for 6 years and for 2 of those 6 I've smoked almost everyday. I can't imagine not smoking again, but I know that I'm addicted to it and I don't want to be a hypocrite who shits on people who are addicted to nicotine but also is addicted to weed. However, one upside to me stopping is I can focus more on tripping and acclimating myself to alcohol because I'll be in Europe next year.

I've read posts and they have given me inspiration to finally quit for good.

I have a long and weird relationship with weed that I may write out in detail soon, but the gist of it is: I've been using (smoking, vaping, edibles) on and off for about 12 years now. When I'm using, I start within 30 mins of waking up, and keep taking higher and higher doses throughout the day, until it's nighttime and I'm sick and tired of having been high all day. Not sick enough, apparently, since the cycle starts all over the next morning.

There are periods when I've been able to stop for a while, which is tough, but then I eventually talk myself into a taste of it, at which point it's really hard to stop.

What's worse is that for the past couple of years, I have even been hiding it from almost everyone I know, including my wife, who doesn't have a problem with weed itself but she knows I've had a problem. It makes me more ashamed and guilty to hide it from her and other friends and family. This also means I don't have a support group to lean on when quitting.

I really wish I could control it better, like only use it at night, and use a moderate amount. I've told myself I can as a way to rationalize vaping again, but it falls apart very quickly. It's too easy to grab the pen and inhale for a few seconds, after which I have almost immediate regret. I've also tried to get less potent THC/CBD combo vape cartridges to moderate my high, but I just end up using more of it to get the same effect.

Now I have been almost forced to go cold turkey after being forced to stay home during this pandemic. I've learned that going into it with a positive attitude makes a huge difference, and I've been good about not giving into mood swings and irritability. But I find myself drinking alcohol to try to replace the high. That has its own problems, including giving me bad stomach pain in the mornings, exacerbating the stomach pains I'm already experiencing with marijuana withdrawal. At least my partner knows 

So... I'm hoping to find some support here since it will help my journey. It's a slow and difficult effort to climb the mountain, but it's really easy to fall back down to the bottom. Here's hoping I never look down again.",4,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71399873}"

I guess I’m the exception.,"I know that study came out that said marijuana users are thinner than their non cannabis counter parts. But not with me.

One of the main reasons I'm quitting is the munchies and eating too much while high. I read all the time to do this/do that (chew gum, drink water..etc) and have will power or eat before you blaze up. Did all that and sometimes my munchies were under control. More times than not, I ate more than I should. The fact remains that marijuana produces Ghrelin in the stomach, the chemical that tells your brain you're hungry. I need that like a hole in my head.

Yeah it's enjoyable and food tastes great but I eat too much and put on almost 10lbs in the last few months. It's not healthy. Coupled with the fact that working out and running high felt like 3x the effort vs when I'm not stoned. I also could never vape in moderation. Tried multiple times. Nope.

Just not eating like a pig for the past 48hrs since I stopped is a victory in itself. Not to mention how much better I feel.

What do I miss the most? The inhale/exhale/taste. The ritual of using my Pax Era and having it next to me all the time. That was so habitual. It will take time to adjust.

Now for most of these I'd say they are reasonable symptoms of cold turkey withdrawal. I've experienced the headaches and night sweats before when stopping for shorter amounts of time. 

But the fever and shortness of breath worry me (anxiety much?). The slight fever actually came back, I had had something similar about two weeks ago before quitting cold turkey, so I'm not sure what the relation is.

But the day I quit I also noticed I had a painful, swollen lymph node in the groin. Now I've had this before in the past, symptom of stress. But combined with the night sweats, slight fever and shortness of breath I'm actually starting to worry since those could be the symptoms of lymphoma. 

Now usually I'd call my GP but due to corona we're only supposed to call for emergencies, and I'd feel like an ass if it turns out to be just me having anxiety and weed withdrawal.

So last month i slipped up and would have tested positive for both ecstasy and marijuana. They test my urine for substance when i go for my checkup. So i brought a sample of urine from a friend  who doesn't use.

During the checkup the psychiatrist proceeded to quiz me on my symptoms and how i was doing generally in my life the past month  and i told him not great since he is not giving me meds for my adhd and instead being adamant i can learn to cope without it. Long story short it was me trying to squeeze some stimulants out of him and him not giving in.

Towards the end of the session he said your biggest achievement this month is being sober and you should feel proud of yourself as we all are.

So tmr i will be going in for my checkup after a month and guess what i havent used ecstasy for a month and a week and cannabis for 25 days. And damn i feel proud of myself.

That undeserved compliment from my psychiatrist completely charted my sobriety this past month. I didn't feel temptation when friends were smoking up around me and when i was feeling down. Just goes to show you the wonders your mind can do when it is shown a little bit of validation from an external source.

Positives + Saving money is an obvious one, although weed isn't too expensive of a drug i still spent about 50 bucks a week on it (half a gram a day) which can definitely add up considering I'm only 21. So that's an extra couple hundred a month i didn't have a before. 
+ Sleep has been a huge benifit, going to bed way earlier since I'm not up watching YouTube till 2AM, this means I'm also waking up earlier and I realized i was missing out on such a big chunk of the day, i feel like a morning person now for the first time ever. Insomnia only lasts a week or so after stopping and the intense dreams start to decline as well. 
+ More focused on other parts of my life, it's sorta like my brain has an extra 10 percent kick to it, giving me the motivation and energy to persue other areas of my life like studies and exercise. 
+ More 'awake', the infamous weed fog has lifted to a degree, I'm more engaged in conversations, can focus better and feel generally more connected to the world around me. 

Neutrals / Although i feel more mental clarity, 
this peaks after a month or so and i haven't felt much different since then (i wasn't a wake and bake stoner though) 
/ my social life hasn't changed a tone, i hang out with my stoner buddies still but a bit less and can't relate to them quite to the same level as when i smoked (often leave earlier etc) and i thought i would start drinking more but that didn't happen either. 
/ Less mood swings, i feel randomly moody (in positive and negative directions) much less than when i smoked more. 

Negatives - Definitely experience more boredom when i have entire nights to myself, harder to fill that 6 till 11pm time when i have the night to myself etc. 
- more on edge, weed put me on this constant dazed feeling even when i was sober so I've been feeling anxious/edgy more often but that can be good and bad (sometimes you shouldn't be chill). 
- I occasionally miss the gratitude/appreciation for life/deep mind-state feeling weed can give you expecially alone. 

So there you go, take it for what it's worth. If you are considering quitting, it's only the first couple of weeks that are actually difficult in my experience then it begins to feel like you never had a problem.

The first week or so has had its ups and downs. I’ve been focusing on attainable daily goals, just trying to keep focused on where I’m headed with my life. I’ve been out of work for a few months, and since I quit smoking I have been actively looking for work. Now with covid19 running its course, things are looking fairly bleak. I’m actually kinda nervous about the future. Mainly financially. 

I went to the grocery store yesterday, which I managed to get 1 thing on my list because shelves are barebones. I walked by the recreational cannabis store. I couldn’t give two shits about it. I realized right then, I do have some mental strength to basically say fuck my vices and even though times are hard - I need myself to be my own vice if you will. Even with st paddy’s day, this will be my first year in decades without a drink. I suppose I am proud of myself for finding this mental strength. I just read about, here in Canada recreational cannabis stores are seeing huge sales the last week, as people are hunkering down with the social distancing and layoffs happening. I still don’t care. I need my head to be at its best. I want to find a way to get employment in this god awful economy. It’ll take more time, more debt, seeing my credit score dip but as shitty as that will be - I’ll stay sober. Maybe 6 months from now, I will be working, paying my debts off and be that much stronger mentally - whilst staying on sobriety journey.

I hope you all are staying strong in these trying times. Personal growth doesn’t come easy, but something tells me that when you really vision a better version of yourself - not much can stop it, including world pandemics and a piss poor economy!

&#x200B;

This post has been a few days coming. Today was my 34th day free from THC and I wanted to update everyone. Tell my story, give some advice on things that worked for me and put my old identity to rest.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR at bottom**

&#x200B;

**The Story:**

My relationship with weed started about nine years ago, I was still in high-school. It started off like most people a joint here or there with some friends. However it quickly progressed into wanting to smoke alone, or smoke at home.  Eventually becoming an everyday thing and shortly after an all the time thing. I would smoke about 3 grams a day 'hitting pails'. It slowly ruined my life and destroyed my motivation to make any meaningful changes. In my personal experience weed made me very complacent and as a result depressed, anxious and generally unhappy. In my experience it became the only thing that could make me happy, it was the major driving force in my life. I'm not too educated or well-read on the science of it, but this has a lot to do with dopamine. It also enabled me to avoid dealing with issues that were arising in my life. I would literally wake up and smoke a 'pail' every five minutes until I forgot to. When I got home from work I would do the exact same thing. I would promise myself I would quit or cut back almost every single night when I was laying in bed with my own thoughts. Wake up in a haze and then do it all over again. Weed because of a problem when its the answer to all of your problems, as it did for me. It also created new problems, like overeating and binge eating, wasting time watching the same movies and tv shows repeatedly or spending countless hours on video games. The list goes on and on but, I'll cut it off there because I'm sure you've experienced some of these things, or read the story many times.

&#x200B;

**My Catalyst:**

The 11^(th) of February was my Dad's birthday, while at work I got a text from my Mom saying that we would be going out later on to celebrate. I was physically and emotionally angry. In my mind this had ruined my plan for the day of going home, getting baked out of my mind and playing the same old video games until I passed out. Something I would do almost every day. However, it didn't sit quite right at the same time; what kind of piece of shit son doesn't want to celebrate his father's birthday with him. (Side note: Yes I know some people from shitty families, however, that isn't my situation. I have loving and caring parents. I treated them poorly because of my relationship with weed and fucked up priorities).  When I got home in a panic I rushed to get as high as possible before we went out for dinner so I could be completely spaced out at dinner. I even gave my mom shit on my way in the door for surprising me with last-minute plans that ruined my day. Once I was sufficiently high I realized it didn't make me happy. It didn't fix any of my problems. Everything was exactly the same. I fell down a rabbit hole thing about other relationships in my life and the way I have acted towards people who care about me. At that moment I felt so fucking stuck. I felt trapped. I was in a cycle of getting high and trying to forget about the world. It broke me. I had a panic attack, screamed out in pain and then began uncontrollable shaking on the floor crying for about 30 minutes. My parents took me to a walk-in clinic where I was giving a high dose of Ativan(an anxiety medication) and enough pills to get me through the next day or so until I was able to talk with a therapist. Without a doubt, the panic attack was the worse feeling I had ever had in my entire life. I never want to feel that again. The medication I was given made me feel like a complete zombie, unable to think or focus on any task. It was over the course of this experience I was able to admit my addiction once again and seek help.

&#x200B;

**How I've been able to change:**

I'm going to be completely honest with you; there is no quick fix to addiction. There isn't one magic trick or even ten things you need to do. It's a daily grind, a struggle to get better. Some days are easier and better than others, but this demon will always be with you. Tempting you and trying to trick you back into your old ways. However, one of the most important things you can do for yourself is to create a new identity, if you don't want to be that same old lazy predictable stoner any more than be someone else. Get rid of any weed you have, get rid of the things that remind you of getting high. Your coffee mug with pot leaves on it. You aren't that person anymore. Become the person you want to be. If you want to be someone who lives a healthy lifestyle start going for walks or bike rides, hit the gym. If you're someone who loves food learn how to cook or learn how to make new and interesting foods. If you want to be someone who reads a lot then pick up a book and get started. Even if you aren't a reader I highly recommend a book called Atomic Habits, by James Clear. It will help you understand the choices you've made and teach you strategies for how to create new and better habits. If you don't change anything you will quickly fall back into your old habits as I did many times before. That's why this will be my final post on this account. I have been working on creating a better version of myself, and the screenname earL is part of my past. **Today I put earL to rest, once and for all.** earL is a screen name and identity that I had created for myself. Inspired by a rapper of the same name and albums such as 'I don't like shit, I don't go outside'. earL was a lazy stoner gamer that only ever cared about himself and getting high. He was incredibly short-sighted. He ran from his problems and emotions. I refuse to be that person any longer. In my opinion, that's all life is,  moment to moment you get to choose who you want to be. It will almost never be easy, but you have the choice.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** *You can make the future, but it starts with leaving the past.*

In the dream, I knew I wanted to get rid of all of it (as I would in real life, I planned to give it all to my sister, who can smoke up without incident, lucky bitch) but out of habit, I hit the pen once just to see if it worked.

Longtime lurker, first-time poster.

I joined Reddit to join Leaves. Y'all are f'in awesome people, especially to each other. Keep it up!

I have an unhealthy relationship with weed. So we're breaking up... It's me weed, it might be you too, but I know for sure that it is me, and so I've got to make like a tree and leave. (had to, sorry!)

I want to tell my story because I think it demonstrates how I have struggled with weed addiction (I'm that person for who 1 is too many and 1000 is never enough) at multiple times in my life for different reasons, but perhaps, also the same reasons.. dunno if it might help others in similar situations, but on the off chance it might, here it is.. This is going to be lengthy, so tldr at the bottom. ;)

I started toking around 17, only on occasions, until I was 19. At 19, I went on a year long working holiday in Aotearoa/New Zealand and weed was everywhere I went as I did outdoor agricultural labour with fellow travellers and locals. Reluctantly came back to Canada at 20, felt a bit lost in life and  really just fell into weed big time living with some old friends and working menial jobs. 

From 20-24, I was maybe sober for a few weeks 2 or 3 times during that period. I did everything I could that was weed-based, edibles, extracts, etc. Lost non-toking friends, distanced myself from family, stopped many of my hobbies (hiking, biking, kayaking, reading) and basically self-isolated with 2 stoner buddies in a odd world of weed, shrooms and mdma. During this time  I worked menial jobs basically for these drugs. That's it. No savings. Nothing. At 25 I had $0 to my name, no real personal property beyond clothes, and struggling with credit card debt (yep - the drugs)..

At 25, had a sort of nervous breakdown/rock bottom moment and moved back home with my (still!) understanding and supportive folks, and was off all drugs (weed included) completely. Got my life back on the level and got accepted by a university as a mature student. Fuck yeah :)

University goes well for me because I put myself into the work and I am passionate about  environmental studies... Though I do end up toking on weekends again as an after work treat. I managed this routine well and can't recall deviating.. Anyway, I end up applying for Graduate school on the prompt of one of my professors. I apply and am accepted. Also begin a serious relationship for the first time in my life at 29(!!).. yep - I had previously given up on having intimate relationships to smoke weed... yeah, wtf.

The first year of  grad school I was completely clean as I moved to a new city didn't know anyone yet for weed contacts and was so focused on school I wasn't really looking.. Eventually I randomly meet J, local dealer, save his contact info but don't buy any right away. My serious relationship is strained by Grad school and my partner abruptly leaves to go work in Indonesia with Orangutans for 6 - 9 months. I do not handle this at all well. Call up J and I fall back to my 20-24 days, smoking morning til night for 3 months. Partner breaks up with me. Totally understandable but heart-wrenching. I stop toking altogether after that as it only makes me think of them. Throw myself into my studies... this goes well for a time..

I over-complicate my project, mismanage my time and ran out of funding, so I have to move home to try and complete it. I do OK for a bit, but living with my Dad at 32 just imploded my self-esteem. What did I stupidly do? You know it... back into being high all day everyday... fuck my project, fuck my life, fuck everything.. let's blaze and forget it all in a haze.

2018: just clouds of smoke and mounds of edibles and extracts ... didn't do a thing but work in a warehouse to make money so I could be perma-fried.. a truly pointless existence. Weed also becomes legal in Canada, and is everywhere I look (or so it seemed)..

Early 2019, I move out of my Dad's and in with a newish partner (\~1 yr). Stop toking for a month and finish my project. When I'm done the project (besides minor edits), that little voice - y'all know it - was like, you know what you deserve right now? Yep.

I'm ashamed to say that I caved on one joint, then one sack, etc ... I was high for all of 2019 and the first two and half months of 2020. Certainly not bragging about that, as I'm fucking ashamed of that reality.

I cannot do this anymore. The constant anxiety of having enough weed and/or smoking it too fast, the cost, the overall apathy it brings forth in me, the way my body and lungs now feel, the way I'm not really present in my relationships.. I'm just done with all of it. I want out.

My first day completely sober in around 2 years was Sunday March 15th, 2020. 

I'm currently taking it one day at time. 

I've been through the withdrawals multiple times now with little variation, so I know roughly what to expect and am steeling myself for the coming anxiety and restlessness.

Finally, I'm not going to toke today and I hope y'all don't too (if that's your goal).

TLDR: Started smoking weed at 17. Got heavy into it at 19-20. Was high from 20-24. 25 quit and go to Uni. 27, start smoking on weekends at Uni. 29, I go to grad school, partner leaves me, smoke morning til night for 3 months. Quit again. Don't finish degree on time, move home with Dad, self-esteem implosion, back to toking all day everyday for a year and a bit. Move out. Finish Project. One joint and then back to smoking all day every day for another year. The present: I want out. No more weed.

I am no different then anyone but I feel the need to articulate my views not just so I can hear it but to encourage you guys, my peers to chase the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Firstly i have come to realise everyone has a go to to escape reality some use sports,Gym, singing etc while others use alcohol, weed or Pursue sexual desires such as porn or going to the club to pick up chicks. Of course we don’t pick one or the other And I’m not one to say what is the right or wrong way but there is obviously a way that is self improving and a way that is self destructive. What we need to take into account is that we need to throw ourselves into and learn to love the things that will make us feel content and make us feel as if we have spent our time worth while at the end of the day. If we don’t we will always find ourselves drifting back on the path of self destruction and using ‘quick fix’ pleasures that just put our instinctive desires to grow, evolve and be the best we can be at the back of our mind and keep them suppressed until they manifest into mental health issues which would hinder our chances and take us further away from the ideal form of ourselves that we all have imagined and dreamed of. I have relapsed many times but I am still proud of myself and you should be to if you actually care about changing as many people don’t. The fact that we want to change means that our spirit, soul, subconscious mind, whatever you want to call it knows were we are now isn’t who we really are and is pushing you to become your best self. Now. Rome wasn’t built in a day, we will make mistakes but let’s continue fighting and pushing and trying to self improve until our mind submits to our will and we eventually look back and realise that we did it. We are sober, we are happy and we are creating the life of your dreams. :)",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5408175}"

The aspect of being productive all the time is present but it feels like a negative since there is no reward even for hard work, or maybe the gratification is too delayed.

Currently 31, been smoking since the age of 19. Picked up the habit in my senior yr of high school during summer school at that 🙄. I tell you I will NEVER forget the day. Decided to quit because I honestly could not remember my life weed free. It had become a major part of my lifestyle, my budget, my relationships etc. I no longer kept my habit to myself being that everyone around me smoked as well, or were at least former smokers. I always wanted to smoke responsibly so I would stop for two to three weeks then gradually begin on nights and weekends, then before you know it I was back to my 3 times a day as if it were food. I'm repulsed just by remembering how fiend out I was. In my early twenties when I was still not financially stable, I caught myself doing things and in situations just to maintain my habit. 

My epiphany came along on January 29th of this year when I decided to file my taxes. When I combined my w2s and realized I made over 60k in 2019 with no savings, no car, credit score in the low 500s and nothing to show but an associates degree and an apartment (rented). I knew I couldn't continue living like this. I felt like a complete loser I might as well had been unemployed on government assistance like those around me who struggled and still maintained. I never knew the mood swings were real. And the night sweats, cough and lethargy. I honestly cannot relate to the loss of appetite cause I find myself more hungry than ever.

 Since quitting I broke up with my long term partner, respectfully distancing myself from my toxic mom after telling her how I truly felt about a particular situation and currently applying to every job that I've wanted that weed held me back from all these years. I hadn't realized how much I tolerated from other people, just allowing myself to be taken advantage of and spoken to any kind of way suppressing my feelings and thoughts and true opinions with a blunt.

I remember the same old pattern, looking at the weed like ""at least it's alright quality"". Then I vaped on the way back home while driving. I remember thinking ""did I really just go and buy weed? I've been telling myself I don't need to fear my cravings or thoughts, why the hell did I relapse, and it's like I didn't even notice doing it?"" Even in the dream, I was too high, and the vape was still on, so like the addict I was I would keep dragging on the vape to get every possible chemical left.

Soon I woke up from that dream, relieved that it was just a dream and I didn't actually ingest or buy weed. I literally felt uncomfortable and regretful in the dream like wtf did I just do, many times like I've felt IRL when I've wanted to quit but I go buy ""just 2 grams, this is the last time"" and immediately after buying I'm like wow, now I have to use this weed... ffs.

Anyway, that dream felt like a confirmation that I don't want that life, I don't want to be high and paranoid. Even though today I'll have weed on my mind because of that dream, the dream reminds me that it didn't feel good and I'm sort of thankful for that reminder.

Me and my partner been living together in a flat and been smoking weed for  a little more  then 4 years, im not gonna like i enjoyed the high i enjoyed the time but looking back now i spent most of my days being lazy not catching up  with chores(cleaning) the tiredness was building up and only time to catch up was when i had days off when again was smoking morning till evening
Work wise couldn't  focus ,always  had that ""i just woke up"" face  for  half of my shift which turns into i wanna  go home and smoke more thought and not focusing on my job yet again
We stopped going out or meeting with friends because only thing we wanted to do is smoke and that took most of our time,had a huge impact on my social life
Stopped caring as much of my look,went multiple  times to work not groomed proper ,missing small details like making sure i ironed  my shirt proper or making sure my suit was without  a stain as i had to look apart(Assistant Bar Mannager) 
Family wise i feel i pushed  them away by avoid  repaying to messages or answering phone calls (including  my friends phone calls) 
The money spend came around 200-250£ every single month on weed only plus another 50£on tobacco rizla and whatever
The amount  of sweets we were eating was astonishing
On a daily  basis  we were buying  crisps,chocolate,candy whatever we fancy as we were most likely  smoking before going to corner shop which  totalled  an average 5-10£ a day
Eating proper was nonexistent! 
Love cooking but we always end up eating junk food
Food schedule again  nonexistent,
Waking up 2pm quickly getting ready for work and not eating anything till 5pm when i would usually  have fries and or a cheese sandwich till 11:30pm when my shift  ends and going  home to quickly  smoke again and eating a meal around 1am takeaway or something  unhealthy like cheese on toast and probably staying  till around 3am
Neglected everything around me ,my cat will not have  he's toilet  changed often thus end up stinking for days , not to mention house in poor shape as smoking and relaxing  was more important  then anything  else

But we have been clean for 17days already  and i know it doesn't sound  a lot but feel much better now and i feel i done more in two-weeks then i done in 1 year while on weed
Im coming from a place where weed order is faster then most takeaways and most of the time i only had to go in front of my building  to meet with my dealers
I don't regret smoking i regret  i let it last for soo long ,should of stopped a few years back
Turned 30 this year and i felt i needed a change ,now looking to prepare ourselfs for a house mortgage starting end of this year(waiting to do our residency documents)
Im posting this so i can look  back in a year time

Short description,
Me and my partner meet almost 5 years ago ,smoked ever since 
Become lazy,house neglected,really bad food habits stopped meeting with friends and stopped answering to anyone as we only wanted to smoke every day
Feel my memory turned in to mush because of it (think im slowly recovering now)
Spent around 300£/month on weed and weed related stuff
200£/month on sweets alone to feed our crave

I live in Ohio, and because of all the stress from the crash in the economy, health scares, and now I've been temporarily laid off because I'm a server (if you don't know all dine in restaurants were ordered to shut down until further notice), I can't stop smoking. My anxiety is through the roof. I'm trying my best to wrap my head around the possibility of not working for over a month (who knows how long really), applying for unemployment for the first time, the potential for my elderly parents to contract this virus, and even just thinking about the mass amounts of people that have been so severely effected by this in so many ways. None of this feels real, and trying to come to terms with that has been a lot harder than I thought. 

I'm also worried about my own health. A few years ago I had cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome which tormented my body for almost a full 6 months. I have been able to smoke a little bit over the years without any problems, but I typically make sure I don't smoke too much just to be safe. I know most people might say I shouldn't be smoking at all, but I really enjoy it from time to time, and I promise it doesn't effect my body like that anymore. 

I'm not necessarily nervous about getting CHS again, but I know I shouldn't be smoking as much as I do just in case. I can't stop though. Everything I do, which isn't much because of my anxiety, makes me even more anxious. I go grocery shopping. Anxiety. I try to sleep. Anxiety. I try to watch a movie. Anxiety. I'm trying to stay strong and positive during all of this, but there is a constant underlying feeling of anxiety no matter what I do. My fiance is also laid off right now, and he also experienced a lot of trauma during 9/11, so I can only imagine how much this economic crash and loss of our jobs is effecting him. I don't want my anxiety to make things worse for him either. 

I'm sorry, I guess I'm just releasing some fears and anxieties. I don't know what I'm looking for out of this post, but I also don't really know what to do with myself in general right now. All I can say then I guess is thank you to everyone who reads this for at least listening. A lot of people are suffering right now, and I feel communication with each other will be a major factor in relieving some stress for everyone.

So I ended up getting an oz finished that about 3 weeks ago and have only partake with other people since then. Now for the story, I went out to a gig with a couple friends a few nights ago had a boogie some drinks overall great time. But we ended up kicking on to this random blokes house with a few others, they were all super lovely people felt welcome as soon as we sat down. Then they started handing around the bong, I thought it'd be nice to have a cone kick back and relax but I had one and it didn't quite sit right. It came back around to me by the time I gained my composure so i thought having another wouldn't be too bad. Hoh boy! Let's just say very mild panic attack ensued I'm pretty sure I kept it well internal only one of my mates noticed so i went outside sat down on the cold grass and just let my body cool back down so i could settle. 

But it was horrible! I've never had weed do that to me needless to say outside of going back home and catching up with my dad i don't think I'll be smoking bud again for quite some time. 

I also just wanted to say a thankyou to this community reading all of your stories has definitely helped especially over those first few weeks without bud.

However, with the coronavirus and the economy in freefall, I have to say that weed may be responsible for destroying my future and my career.

I originally quit in June 2019 because I was going to be looking for a new job in a new city.  However, in August I talked to my boss and I ended up being able to get a job transfer.  Since I no longer was going to have to worry about a job search, I started smoking weed again.  All was fine and dandy until November, when we merged with another company and I was demoted from IT to being a customer service rep in a call center environment.  I then knew I needed to once again give it up because I was going to have to go into the job market and needed to be able to pass a pre-employment drug screening.  I made it about 14 days that time and relapsed again.

After returning from the New Years holiday, things at my job deteriorated to the point where it's literally giving me health problems.  I'm miserable and feel like a total failure in life.  This demotion has been a HUGE hit to my self-esteem and when I combine with with with withdrawal and PAWS, it's almost been too much to deal with.  After over seven years with the company this is how I'm rewarded. I have to get out of here, but this weed addiction was the one thing standing in my way.  I quit on January 13, 2020.

Just as I'm starting to get over the withdrawal hump and getting to the mental place where I can begin a job search, the coronavirus and economic collapse occurs.  With millions of people going to be out of work and unemployed over the next few months, the chances of me getting out of this job any time soon have vanished.  I'm going to be stuck here for a while.  Even after the virus is over, this is likely going to be like 2009-2011 where I'm just going to have to make do and deal with being underemployed for a while.

I got fired from my job. I’m trying to get married in a couple months. My money to pay my taxes was in the stock market. My whole body is starting to feel slightly sick. My dads business is crumbling because of this virus. I’m stressed out of my fucking mind. 

A year and a half ago I dropped all of my savings to go to a computer coding bootcamp. I was desperate to turn my life around a friend told me he went from making $15 an hour to $75,000 a year by attending a coding bootcamp. 
That was enough for me to hear so I immediately signed up. (I wasn’t a computer kind of person) I didn’t even own a laptop till 4 days before class started. 
I jumped in and got my ass kicked. It was so hard. Eventually I started to get the hang of it and now I’m pretty good at the basics. It switched from a way to make a living to a true passion. I love spending hours at my computer building little websites. 

But I’ll admit I was one of the worst in my class. It clicked for so many people. But I struggled. And I know it’s because I was getting fucking high all the time. I had a dab pen I’d bring to class with me. I’d smoke it before. I’d smoke it at lunch. I’d smoke it in the damn bathroom stalls. I know for a fact I didn’t get as much out of class as I could have because I was high 100% of the time. 

After I got out I was able to find a job. (A job that was basically handed to me) and I did the same damn thing. Got high before. Got high during. And my work ethic started to tank. I seriously hate myself for it. 

It got to a point where I wasn’t getting the job done I was hired to do so they let me go. 

I have been applying for jobs. I have probably applied for 50+ jobs. Every single one of them either ghosts me, or tells me they are looking for somebody with more experience. 
How the fuck am I suppose to get experience if nobody will give me the opportunity. 
I had 2 jobs that were very interested in hiring me. I was so excited. I have been studying like crazy to prepare. Got word from both of them today they are moving on with other more experienced candidates. 

I have nobody else in my pipeline. Nobody is even considering me. Nobody is considering anyone right now because this effing virus is ruining everything. 

I’m supposedly getting married in June. But I don’t have a job. My fiancé is basically my suga mama. Paying our bills. Buying our groceries... I keep telling her everything will work out when I get a developer job. Been saying that shit for months now. Now it’s starting to look hopeless. Who knows what I’m going to do. I don’t want to go back to I what I was doing. I spent all my money to go to class and lived off my credit card for 6 months. 

I have so much debt. I have been a Lyft/Uber driver while I apply for jobs. Meaning I need to pay my own taxes. I was putting money in the stock market which was going great until it wasn’t. I’m literally down like 50%. I don’t have enough money to lay them once they are due next month. Not to mention I don’t have a job other than driving for Uber. Which I don’t want to do because of this virus now. 
I’m literally screwed. 

All I want to do is load a fat bong bowl and numb out. But I already know from experience it’s NOT GOING TO HELP. it always makes things worse. That shitty little voice in my head starts to become a real asshole when I smoke. 

The last 2 weeks of not smoking have seriously been great. I’m more awake. I’m more alive. I’m smarter. I thought I was going to get a job. I thought I was going to get married. Still am. But I’m not quite sure if anyone is going to be there because of this quarantine. 

I seriously feel like I have nothing to look forward to In my life. 
Been hitting the gym everyday for the last 2 weeks. Can’t do that either. My 3-4 lbs of muscle I gained are going to be gone by the time the gym opens back up. 

Anyway. All I want to do is load a bowl. But at the same time I don’t want to relapse. It took me months and months to actually quit. I can’t ruin it all because of a bad day.

I recently visited a psychologist. Getting a personal mental assessment made me realise that I spent a lot of years reinforcing distorted thoughts. 

The wave of anxiety that comes from reinforcing distortions is what led me to perpetuate the habit of smoking. 

Ever since I have started observing the words I tell myself, and started taking the necessary steps to avoid unnecessary anxiety, things have become easier. 

I now experience much less levels of stress and anxiety. But I hear the demon constantly whispering ""Just one last joint tonight. You can quit tomorrow""

I was given a choice, give up weed or lose my family so I quit.  Withdrawals for me were a nightmare and it was almost 3 months before things got better.  Fast forward to November and I was feeling great about myself and started having thoughts of smoking again and how strong my self control had become but you know that’s just a trick your addict mind plays on itself to get what it wants. Unfortunately I fell for it and started smoking again and of course it only took a day or two to get back to full blown heavy use. Soon after I got sick...like sicker than I had ever been.  Constant fever that couldn’t be controlled, throwing up dozens of times a day for 7-10 days in a row. I thought it was a stomach virus and decided not to get medical attention, continued smoking of course because it’s supposed to help with nausea, and just rode it out. A couple weeks later it happened again but I was still refusing to go to a doctor. Then during Christmas it happened a third time and I knew this was something I had to seek medical help for.  I was totally honest with my doctor about everything and he ordered a bunch of tests but nothing was able to explain what was wrong with me. My doctor’s exact words after all the testing were “we are chasing a rabbit down a hole” and said exploratory surgery was the only option I had left. I declined and started doing my own research and thankfully found out about CHS and immediately knew this was exactly what I was experiencing.  I was shocked to learn how many deaths have occurred from this due to renal failure. It was a bittersweet discovery because being that close to death is one hell of a motivator but it also meant I had to quit again and this time for good. I can’t even use CBD products because any cannabinoid will trigger it. I am now 30 days sober and I can say it has been the easiest thing I’ve ever done. For whatever reason I have had almost no withdrawal symptoms and my mental outlook is so positive it’s scary. If any of you are experiencing these symptoms I urge you to read about CHS and maybe you too can be handed the motivation to kick the habit.

So I started smoking back in freshman year of high school, and it was only a few times a week thing until my junior year. I started battling depression, and smoking weed was my escape mechanism.  It didn't get really bad until I went to college. My first (and only) year I was using it multiple times a day, probably smoking .5gs each session. This was when my depression was at its worst, and weed was the only true friend I had (but looking back now, this is because when I was high I became a hermit, not leaving my dorm room except to go to class, sometimes lol).

I decided to drop out of college after my first year, as it was just making my depression worse and worse. This is when I started smoking like no other. I got a full time job at a juice shop, and was selling weed on the side (to pay for my habit). At this point, I was smoking more than an 8th each day. In the past year, I had a huge shift in conciousness, and started being more concerned about my health. I switched from smoking it to vaping it, but it still left me unmotivated, lazy, and completely couch locked.

Within the past year, I was sober for about 2-3 months, two seperate times. After being sober for a month or two, I thought why not try it again and see if I can control it. But of course, I couldn't. Started taking a rip or two from the bong at night, and it turned into taking a few rips every few hours. I now can see that I can not control myself when it comes to smoking weed. It also makes me completely unmotivated to do anything, and as I am starting my own business, that just isn't a good combination. I have been sober for the past 3 days, and Im looking forward to experiencing the rest of my life sober, as I cant remember much from my childhood except getting high with friends.

I stopped buying but he still has his stash. Tonight I rolled up a joint and was about to smoke but I just couldn’t get myself to do it. Don’t get me wrong, it would’ve been easy to go out and smoke but I knew it wouldn’t make me truly satisfied.

It would feel like my 3.5 days of withdrawals and mood swings would have been for nothing. I knew i’d probably get so high I’d lose my discipline and watch porn (currently doing no fap as well). The next morning I’d wake up feeling like absolute shit. All for some short term pleasure. I’m sad because it’s 2am here and I’m wide awake. However, I refuse to let myself be a living sack of shit any longer. I haven’t even lived a full week sober as an adult (currently 20). I just feel so ashamed of myself because I cant stop thinking about wanting to go and smoke.

Long story short, had to quit for a job. Used to subvert the tests, but moved away from home and decided it was best to do it the straight and narrow way to not risk the loss of income/not being able to pay bills.

I was a heavy heavy smoker. Like an ounce a week average. And now, 97 days... so what brings me here is today I went back home for a visit. Had the opportunity to take whatever I wanted from my buddy. Had a bud in my pocket. Then with much sadness, realized that one bud would lead to many, many more, and put it back. It’s been a tough road. I don’t enjoy the same hobbies I used to, but I am much more productive. I am constantly bored though. 

Getting back into gaming (damn do I miss getting high and falling into a game) but I can only play for a couple hours max before I lose interest. Been working out which I definitely would not do as much if I were constantly high.
Going to buy a guitar tomorrow and I’m gonna try to spend a good deal of time doing that.

Here's what weed does to me.,"I didn't smoke for almost a year and thought to myself, ""Congrats man, you've earned it. You're clearly mentally strong and capable of using this drug responsibly. Go ahead and drive to the dispensary and grab an 8th, it'll be different than the last time(s).

Narrator: It was not different than the last time(s).

It's the same shit *every fucking time*. I just lost a full month, again. Here's what smoking does to me.

* **Smoking makes me lose all self-control.**  It becomes the only thing I think about until it's gone. My world revolves around it. What starts as just a tiny snap before bed very quickly turns into ripping massive bong hits as early as 6 am. Moderation is impossible. I once bought a box that locked and had a timer on it to try to moderate but I ended up smashing it with a hammer to get to my stash.
* **Smoking turns me into a crackhead fiend who only cares about getting high one more time**. After I'm done smoking all the actual flower, I'll go to the kief. After that's done, I take an electric toothbrush and brush over every inch of my 4 piece grinder to get enough for another hit. After that's done, I'll ISO wash my grinder for another weak high. After my grinders all clean, I'll scrape my bowl and downstem for resin. I'll roll that into a ball and smoke it. It tastes fucking awful but I don't care. After that's done I'll dump my bong water into a strainer and collect the small pieces of weed that I snapped through when I was smoking. Nasty, bong water-soaked pieces of weed that could be moldy for all I know. I've smashed two separate bowls and a downstem to get to the hard-to-reach places where resin collects. And finally, I've even stolen weed from a 75yr old because I was taking care of her house and happened to stumble upon a pretty good amount where I knew I could take some without her noticing. What a good person I am.
* **Smoking makes me feel guilt and shame**. I know it's not good for me. I know it only makes things worse. So why do I keep doing it?
* **Smoking makes me avoid people and activities.** When I smoke, I turn into a complete hermit. I don't talk to friends, I don't talk to family, I just sit in my room high or thinking about the next time I can get high. It's all I care about or want to do. I have a very close relationship with my mom but when I'm smoking I distance myself considerably.
* **Smoking makes me smelly**. My room stinks. My clothes stink. My breath and lips stink. My bed stinks. The smell leaks into the rest of my house and my parents or siblings complain about it.
* **Smoking makes me tired to the point of barely functioning**. This is a big one for me. The next day after smoking, I'm always fucking exhausted. I'm extremely groggy, my eyes are puffy and heavy, I feel like complete shit until around dinner time. And then what do I do immediately after dinner? Smoke. It's a never-ending cycle of feeling terrible.
* **Smoking makes me feel dumb**. The fog is horrendous. My short term memory is completely fucked when I'm high. I can't remember simple things I did from the day before.  I can't hold a conversation. I fumble over my words. I can't form sentences. I become really awkward. My personality disappears. I can't maintain eye contact.
* **Smoking makes me anxious and paranoid**. I get intrusive thoughts, paranoia about the smell, anxiety about my future. Endless thought loops about how I'm wasting the ""best years of my life"" and how weed isn't good for me. It makes me think deeply, sure, but none of the thoughts are good.
* **Smoking makes my depression worse.** I have MDD and I honestly couldn't think of a worse substance for my depression than weed. It makes me slower, more tired, and more depressed than I am when I'm not smoking. I sometimes get suicidal thoughts and burst into tears when I'm high, knowing that I'm only making my condition worse.
* **Smoking makes me content with doing nothing.** Sitting in a messy room, no sheets on my bed, moldy food in bowls. Mindlessly browsing the internet, jerking off, overeating, gaming. Nothing at all gets accomplished. I cannot smoke and be productive. I've peed in bottles because I don't want to walk downstairs.
* **Smoking messes with my appetite.** I overeat. I go days without eating.
* **Smoking ruins my motivation and makes me lazy**. I am not and never will be a productive stoner. I don't get anything done.
* **Smoking negatively affects my business**. I run an online business. I notice when I'm smoking, suddenly my business isn't that important. I let customer support tickets pile up, don't put any effort into it, and kinda just let it cruise when I could be scaling it and working harder on it if I was sober. I had a business do over $1million in revenue, but I'm more interested in smashing my bong bowl to get one more hit of scraped resin out of it. Priorities! Even on days when I was feeling up to working on it, my cognitive abilities were so shot I could barely focus on the task at hand.
* **Smoking makes me oversleep**. Constantly tired and constantly asleep. Days turn into weeks into months.
* **Smoking makes me constantly paranoid about people knowing I'm high.** The febreeze, the ozium, the eye drops, brushing teeth, changing clothes, trying to act normal, ""am I acting normal?"", ""do I look high?"". How am I even enjoying this when I'm expending this much energy to cover it up? Imagine if I put that amount of energy into something more productive.

I'm sure there is more, but that's what I've got right now. To those who read it all, thanks. I'm going  out to my trash can in probably a half hour or so and throwing everything weed related I have in the trash. Bong, bowls, PAX 2, grinder, lighters. I'm fucking done. I need to take some control over my life. If I put it all in a backpack and tuck it in the garage, it will always be there waiting for me to use again. I'm taking control.

Edit: As of this morning, everything is gone. I went out to my dumpster and smashed my bong, shards of glass flying everywhere. It felt so damn good.

Ashamed of missing plans with friends. Ashamed of letting myself down with goals. Ashamed of the money wasted on weed and tobacco. Ashamed of what people would think if they knew. Ashamed of what people think if and when they suspect. Ashamed of how unwell I look all the time.

2020-03-14 20:20:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fishso/making_it_but_so_hard/,"Making it, but so hard","Hi, all. I am new to Reddit in general,and just recently discovered this subreddit in looking for advice and support on stopping weed use.

I didn’t actually first discover weed until age 18. I remember trying it and not getting high at first. When I actually started inhaling though, I knew I had found something I needed more of. It slowed everything wayyy down for me, and no matter how horrible I felt, it gave me clarity and allowed me to see clearly. (or what I thought was clearly.)

When you start smoking every single day, your reality quickly becomes a stoned reality. That is what’s so scary when you stop, because the sober reality you reenter is big and scary. It’s so hard to face.

I smoked basically all of 2019, and stopped in Nov. 2019. I lasted 60 days through Jan. 2020. The panic and unstoppable bouts of tears I had in November were enough to almost make me check myself in. But by Christmas, I was doing OK and beginning to understand life w/o weed.

However, the end of Jan./beginning of Feb. 2020 brought one of the worst depressive episodes I’ve ever had. I started smoking and in a matter of days, I was a regular again. It’s important to note that my doctor increased my Lexapro from 10 mg to 20 mg right before I relapsed, and I had also just had to leave a job I was training for because it was way too stressful. I went kind of manic, and attribute that to part of the relapse. I was staying up late, meeting strangers, taking part in extremely risky and impulsive behavior that left me horrified. I quickly got back on my 10 mg dose. I was less manic, but I had already started the smoking and cigarettes, so it was hard to break.

Background: I have struggled with major depression and show some symptoms of bipolar 2 disorder. Have also struggled with pretty extreme OCD, and can spend hours ruminating on highly specific, haunting thoughts.

Well I could go on about how I’ve basically been so stoned I’ve been in another reality the past month or so. That happened . . . but last night I consumed my last edible at 10 pm. I want to draw the line in the sand here. So it’s almost been 24 hrs. since taking it. My stash is gone. I’m determined to get through the first week or two, and know that I can. I know that PAWS is very real and I’m prepared for that. For me it’s the first couple weeks that are the toughest of all. I have music to write, books to read, people to spend time with. Weed makes me want to sit on my balcony and toke my life away, talking to no one. It’s time to re-integrate back into the world. Ugh it’s just so hard.

I also am turning a lot of this over to God, and am getting back involved with my Christian faith. I am more than open to PM’s w/ others struggling through weed addiction. I don’t have many friends, so talk my ear",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64313287}"

Today was supposed to be a good day, as my daughter is here for the weekend. It’s the first weekend sober in years. My daughter and I always had a good bond. Today I feel so distant from her. I feel this sinking feeling in my heart that I’m such a drag around here. I hide it well. I just woke up from a 30 min nap to try to shake it, but can’t. I should be just enjoying my time with her but my mind and sadness just wants to consume me and my time with her and it’s fucking pathetic that I can’t put those feelings aside to be dad. It’s not that I want to go smoke, I am done with cannabis but it could very well be my uncontrollable emotions due to withdrawal.

I wonder if there is other ppl here who are single parents, who are just getting sober and can relate to what I am saying. It makes me realize, that even tho I think I have been a good dad in the past, maybe it’s because I was just so fucking high a lot of the time that I was content to things with her.

I say this time is different because I no longer smoke with my friends group anymore, I actually only smoke with one person now (who fully understands my struggle with weed). This person, who I’ve met about a month ago and we’ve been dating ever since keeps all week related things with her and only let’s me smoke when she’s over. Now that I’m down to 1 smoking buddy I no longer get panic attacks, anxiety, and trips, trip out, and paranoia which made me realize that maybe... just maybe the issue wasn’t weed as a whole but maybe the issue was not limiting myself like I am now. Most people that know me still think I don’t smoke anymore (as I didn’t tell anyone that I smoke with this girl) and I think their impression of the “stoner version of me” is no longer there which really helped as I’m not getting the same vibes from them. Now here’s the tricky and kinda difficult part: now that I no longer “chill” with my friend group things started to feel distant as I no longer being invited to stuff I usually would be invited to, I barely see/communicate with them and it ducks because for the most part I liked them and really appreciated their friendships but I guess it was just weedships. Still, I’m super happy that I only smoke before bed and I only smoke when she’s over because we agreed to never be high in public, I’m not as mad at weed or to be complete honest at myself. I feel like weed made me hate itself to make me realize that “sober me” had work to do which was filtering people and getting back on my feet. Yes now my weed usage is limited but it’s sure as hell more fun, way more calming and over all just better. Moral of the story; limit who you smile with, make sure you only smoke with people that bring the best out of you, avoid smoking during day hours or when alone; limit your access to weed and things will get better wither you quit or not (keeping in mind the best option out there is not smoking at all but I’m certain that it’s easier said than done).

I started just to experiment, and all of a sudden i started to be really into it. In the previous years, i would never consider even smoking a cigarrete, but after taking some occasional hits in weed, I started to gradually creating routines and smoking more and more until today.

I have done things that I would never have done before. Weed changed my personality, I was really a responsible person, always smiling, and much more disciplined in life. I feel like i've been depersonalized. So much shit happened: my parents (who would never suspect because all my life i had been a responsible person) found a joint and got really dissapointed, spent a lot of (my parents) money, lost friends, but the most painful thing is the feeling that things without weed arent the same.

It's really frustrating because I started to smoke with my friends, and none of them got addicted like I was. I can't control it, as soon as i wake up, i just want to smoke and get high.I wanted to be able to be like my friends, pass my day normally, do my responsabilites, and and at the end, be able to smoke a joint just to chill. But i'ts just impossible for me, I simply skip all my responsabilities and plan to smoke whenever it only depends on me. I get really anxious with everything related with smoking. If I made plans to smoke at 21pm, i will be watching the clock the entire fucking day, waiting on the time to pass as fast as possible, just to get some smoke. I try to managed every opportunity that I have, to smoke, even If i planned to do important things after. Right now I feel like the weed takes all my priorities and just controls me. Several times I've tried to quit weed, but I feel immediatly the effetcs: mood swings, don't wan't to talk, straight face, anxiety, sadness, feeling like anything makes sense, frustration, angry with anything.

Right now, I can't get anything done. I''ve lost my motivation, I try to get envolved in things, but its just for a few time after I start to relapse. I live in a double personality life, where in one I'm a person that constantly smokes and the other one is hiding that i smoked from my family and girlfriend. Even my girlfriend, when we started our relationship, she knew I used to smoke a lot, but thought I havent stopped in the meantime. She thinks that right now I only smoke occasionaly which is not true at all. I've  met her several times while completely high. I've managed my ways to hide that I smoked, but I constantly feel guilty, a manipulator, a liar, double-personality person. My parents took me to a psychiatrist, I've taken some pills for anxiety and all, but after some days or a week, everything returns to the same.

The worst things, is that none of disappointments I cause to me, my family  and friends, is enough to make me quit weed.

Sorry about the long post. I've never talked so openly about this, because I feel shame of myself and shame of how the others will see me. Even my friends with whom I smoke much of the time, don´t know the amount of addictness I have.

After all, I try to bring some positivity to my life and convince me it's all a phase, but those moments are pretty rare. I know I was so much happier before weed, but even that doesn't make me skip. I just don´t have the motivation, the willpower, the resilience. I simply just lie to myself make excuses to light another one.

I don't know if anyone relates, but if anyone has some pratical suggestions that were effective to help in their weed addiction case, I would be extremely grateful. I'm also open to support anyone who is struggling with the same problems. Sometimes just talking helps (felt it after writing all this).

I went really hard on it during 2016/2017. I slowed down a bit through 2019, and even managed to go on a 2 month long hiatus but then relapsed at the beginning of this year. Since my relapse, I've smoked every day, and more times per day than I did before, I started to feel dependent on the Merry Jane for everything from apetite to sleep to stress relief.

However, this frequent use has had me slack up on school work and assignments and socially isolated, as well as low some low self esteem and low self confidence issues that I never really had before that, so I decided to go clean. Easier said than done, but so far I've clocked my first 24 hours. It feels much harder than my previous hiatus, but I hope to soldier on beyond my last 2 months and make this a forever decision.

Hi everyone, to be honest I don’t even know where to start. I started to smoke weed 4 years ago, at the beginning I hated it, had the worst trips possible, but for some reason my teenage self needed to try it till it felt good. I started smoking heavily 3 years ago, everyday, multiple bs a day, i was having the best time of my life till all of a sudden I had a breakdown, I got really sick and ended up in the hospital for 2 months with an eating disorder, GAD, MDD and I disclosed something extremely traumatic to my childhood so I was diagnosed with PTSD. All of this happened so fast, i did have a terrible life but I still managed everything. I stopped caring about school through all of this, I used to want to be a neuro surgeon, I’m sitting here wondering how it got this bad that I had to drop out of my last year of highschool to go to a psych ward. Obviously during the hospital I wasn’t able to smoke, so I had quit for 2 months and my head finally felt clear, but once I got home.. I fell back into the trap. My friends, my sister, they all smoke, so I tried it again, it was the worst decision I had made because I became dependant again. 


How I feel today:
Fast forward to today. I finally decided I have to quit, for good. 3 days ago I hit a b like usual but I started having a panic attack, I didn’t feel like I was in my own body, it was like I was looking over my shoulders instead of through my eyes, I can’t even explain it. I told myself I wouldn’t touch it again, but the next day I woke up, I could not eat, I felt so numb, everything just feels empty. So I gather maybe like 4 tiny crumbs and hit a b just to get some relief. I’ve figured out I do not like the feeling of being high, it gives me anxiety, at this point I’m just hitting bs because I can’t stand the feeling of being empty and numb. Today I haven’t had anything. I woke up crying, I feel terrible, my appetite is 0 but I managed to force some egg and toast down. I know this will be worth it. I want to also clarify I do not blame the weed for this, it was my doing, I abused it. But I just need to get back to that point where I don’t need to hit a b in order to function.

It's been absolutely the best choice I've made in my adult life (almost 43). 

Has it been easy? Hell no. I gave up booze as well which had always been a fallback for when I couldn't smoke weed.

I learned a lot of good and bad things about myself. I learned I can have fun sober. I learned that I spent a shitload of money on tuning out my problems that only caused more problems and never fixed the original ones. 

I started seeing my therapist again, joined a gym, and picked up reading again. I'm enjoying my time with my senior dog, friends, and husband. I still am dealing with cravings and FOMO, plus my brain is sizzling at night with crazy vivid dreams that I completely forgot I used to have. Some good, some bad, but I wake up feeling refreshed. My moods are more stable and I don't feel as depressed or anxious as I used to, and when I have bad days I can manage them way better. 

It was hard and awful at times but I'm grateful. I was able to plan a vacation with the $$ I'm not spending on weed.

This time, it's not so clear where smoking is in the causal chain, but it's abundantly clear it's not helping me get out of whatever funk I am in.

It's some kind of funk. I wake up every day unable to feel connected to my wife, who I only married three fucking months ago. Our sex life has dried up entirely due to me. Our conversations have dried up. My feelings for her have, depressingly and scarily, disappeared.

We just moved to a new country. She goes to work and I stay at home, working online a bit but slowly curtailing my work to enjoy ""a year off"". I thought I would learn to code Python, finish some musical projects I've been working on, and improve my investing habits. Instead, I've basically just smoked hash, and when I scratch that addiction I inevitably end up watching porn and jerking off, and so by the time she gets home I'm dulled out mentally and sexually.

Obviously this isn't working. She slept on the couch last night. I can't even muster up the right reaction to that, I'm so dulled out. Intellectually it bothers me big time, but in my heart I feel very little. 

However, the market drop, both crypto and stocks, has shocked me into something less dulled. I've lost ~ 30% of my net worth in the last week, and I had been saving for a long time. I am going to need to play my cards right over the next few months or else my shit will be even more fucked.

I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe, a 30 day break from smoking & drinking will help me feel something for my partner again, make significant progress on my goals and projects, and learn not to hate myself and how I spend my precious time on earth. And maybe, once that goes well, I will see that I should quit this crutch forever.

There are so many things going on here, and getting high is just one part of it, but the fact is nothing is getting better and I need to make a change to see what results.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.86208415}"

The hardest for me is coding at my desk. I loved indulging while I typed up code, it was glorious, it gave me the numbness I needed to problem solve without anxiety. I'm not sure how to work through that part. 

I ended up taking time off work. I realized that if I can't figure out my foundation, this isn't gonna get easier, and removing weed is gonna show a lot of weak areas I need to support, like self-care, organization, mindfulness, and reliability.

I guess ill start from the beginning. I started smoking weed when i was 12 years old. My grandpa introduced it to me on a road trip. I knew what weed was. My mom and grandpa were both daily stoners so i knew what it was and that it wastent that bad. 

Leading up to smoking weed i would say i had a pretty rough childhood. My mom always had really bad boy friends that would be very drunk and violent which was not fun at all and definitely left some mental scares. 

The first ""bad thing"" i did was smoke a e-cig when i was 9-10 with my then girlfriend.  I liked it i felt cool and grown up i would also makeout with her 16 year old cousin who would give me kissing ""lessons"" and looking back that was pretty.

In 6th grade a few months before i started smoking pot i was staying the night at my then friends house (i moved) and his mom who wasn't home had half a bottle of vodka in the freezer and shot glasses in the cupboard. I had the bright idea to drink ALL of the vodka. So i trying taking a few shots and i almost puked.  I then found out about this wonderful thing called a chaser. So anyways i got really drunk went streaking with only a sweat shirt on. And didn't sleep that night so i went to school drunk. I started to cuss out a teacher (this was normal for me being the school delinquent) and then my friend pulled me away. 

Anyways sry im rambling its the weed

When i was in 7th grade and smoking pretty commonly i got busted selling weed to my friend at school. I got expelled and didn't finish 7th grade (didnt have to retake tho) that was the 2nd time i was in aton of trouble. The first time was when i got expelled in 4th grade when u almost stabbed a kid with a 7 inch long knife. But any who

After i got expelled for weed that didnt stop ms form smkoooing i smoked every day and still do 


Idk where I'm really going with this ive just never told anyone this or ever wrote it out

I did quit once when i almost got drug tested but j dodged that and stared smoking again. And have been smoking ever scents

I still have a ways to go but this is what I have learned thus far/ what keeps me going. I was a heavy smoker, I could function while blazed out of my mind so I smoked all day every day. The first week of not smoking was tough. Second week, not so bad. This week has been tough but I have a high stress job and it's been my job messing with me this week more than not smoking. 

We make it harder on ourselves than it has to be. We truly do. Not knowing how to cope without it. The triggers we encounter. The constant thinking about it. Remembering the taste, the smell, the feel of those soft sticky buds. Mmmmm... It's all on us.

I came across a post on here from a while ago where they essentially said (or at least how I interpreted it) was that if you cant go without smoking you are a slave to it. You are mentally weak. I for one have always prided myself in my mental fortitude. Reading the words of someone I didnt even know, calling me mentally weak, just made something click in my mind. 

No matter how bad I've wanted to smoke, or how close I've come to breaking, those words pop back in my head and I immediately remember why I wanted to stop smoking. 

So let me ask all of you. Are you mentally weak? Are you a slave to a plant? Are you incapable of living life on your own? If you answered yes, what do you intend to do about it? Do you plan on staying that way? Will you just lay there and accept this as your fate? Will you overcome this obstacle in your life or will you let it overtake you? Or will you rise up and come out of this triumphant?

This is what you need to ascertain.

These tribulations will lead to trepidations. Uncertainty in ourselves. Hell, I've even thought I was actually loosing my sanity on a few separate occasions. We just have to remember that there was a reason we set off on this journey. This life is yours. The path you take is yours to own. This isnt about anyone else but yourself.

These words—these values—have been fueling my determination to stay sober.

“Life before death”
For me, the thought of staying high for the rest of my life is like accepting a premature death. I’m living, but not growing. That’s hardly better than death, just sitting there frozen in a comfortable haze, watching life go on without me. 

“Journey before destination”
Staying high is like accepting that I’ve already reached my destination despite having (hopefully) 60+ more years I could otherwise spend continuing this journey.  It means I’ve resigned to settle for what little I’ve already achieved instead of looking forward to all the new things I could achieve before the end.

“Strength before weakness”
I save this one for last because it requires true strength to let go of the vice. It requires true strength to face down the unknown and stride forth to seek further achievement and fulfillment. It’s easy to give up and sit down where you are, but it requires strength to continue up the slope.

This randomly turned into a mountain metaphor, but I, for one, want to experience the view from the summit before I die. I want to be able to look back and relish the road I’ve traveled.

 I have been smoking weed for 3 years now and everyday for the past year or so. i really want to quit smoking, I use it as a coping mechanism when I am stressed and because I am a student I find myself stressed all the time, I have still managed to pass every semester but I have a sinking feeling that my grades are not where they are supposed to be because of the hours I spend high everyday instead of studying and also because of the brain fog that I experience on some days as a side effect of smoking even when I didn’t smoke the day before. I’m in the last year of my degree and I need a higher than average pass so that I can study a postgraduate degree next year. The way I see it the only way I can do this is to spend more time on my work and be as clear headed as I can be for my tests and exams. I have tried exercise, I run three or two times a week for about 5Km. I also do strength training and weightlifting, I eat healthy for the most part and as a result, I’ve lost weight, become stronger and seen so much change for the better but every time I get stressed i get high.

It is still a struggle for me because it was my friend and lover for many, many years. 

He suggested that I learn how to despise marijuana and stop loving it. Unfortunately, our time was up and I'll need to wait till next week to get some tips on how to accomplish it.

Has anyone done this? Learn to hate the drug they are/were addicted to?  It makes a lot of sense. I didn't stop because I stopped loving the high/weed, just that it controlled me, spent tonnes of money and was keeping secrets. Most of all it made me feel like crap about myself.

Started smoking at 17 for the usual reasons - trying to fit in, college friends, dreaming of a never ending fun life style. Used pot and worse drugs. Quit the worse drugs at about age 23, and quit pot at age 25. Managed to stay pot free for almost three years but the cycle wasn’t fully broken in my head during those 3 years. I relapsed just a little short of completing 3 years. For the next 2 years I smoked a lot to compensate for the “3 square years” I “had lost”. In mid 2018 I quit again and stayed about 5 months clean. Then I relapsed again, smoked about 4 times in the period of a month, and after that got pretty sick. I quit that last January and the whole year of 2019 was a big struggle for me. Luckily, and with God’s grace I feel better now. It’s been a year and I’m glad. I don’t feel the urge to go back because 1) I suffered a lot with health problems in the past year and 2) my life is much more complete now, and I have been feeling positive and in the best of my capabilities. I’m a father of a little beautiful daughter now and I don’t want her to think her daddy could not beat this thing.

A counselor told me for her own pot problem, she had a friend tell her to quit for 30 days, and that's it. If life doesn't get better in 30 days because of it, go back to smoking. She quit, and never felt the urge to pick it back up again.

When you feel confused about what you are, then you are thinking too hard. An understanding of ""yourself"" is nothing that you can achieve through thinking.

When you think about it, all sources of unhappiness stem from these unnecessary extra ""layers"" that we stack on top of our natural, peaceful, state of existence. I think weed has a tendency to separate us from our natural state of being in the present moment.

24 year old here who spent half of his life under the influence of the ganja.  I have been using it as a coping mechanism since my mom passed to get through my shitty home life, but also to fit in.  What originally started out as an every once in a while thing turned into a daily need.  I would be high as much as possible and saw hundreds of dollars go down the drain just to keep me from feeling like shit.  Last spring I finished my associates degree in Electrical Engineering and took my last 2 finals high as a kite.  But as of December 2019 I was accepted into my dream University since highschool to finish my Bachelors.  I had made the conscience effort to slow down on the weed because I am in big boy college now and this is my future on the line.  I was good for a few weeks but fell back into my habits.  Fortunately, I have been able to keep up with all my work and have been keeping straight A's, except for once course that is kicking my ass. 

But 2 weeks before my 24th birthday I decided enough was enough.  I would sit in class and feel miserable because I couldn't be high and it really was affecting my ability to concentrate and retain information.  I felt like I couldn't keep up with my peers and I knew weed was part of the reason I felt chained.  I finished the last of my goods and haven't picked up since.  

Overall I feel like I made the right decision but this shitty feeling is lingering.  I constantly get headaches and always feel like I am in a bad mood.  I get a full nights sleep but don't feel rested.  My appetite is completely gone and I keep snapping on people for no good reason.

It’s been a journey of ups and downs, but so far, the pros long outweigh the cons. I’m so much less anxious on a daily basis, and the anxiety doesn’t last nearly as long as it would when I was smoking weed. I’ve had a couple weeks that were spent fairly fatigued, but when I was smoking weed, these depression periods would last much longer. I thought I would never get here when I was still smoking weed. Going an hour without a toke felt impossible at points.

I felt so down on myself, and I could only focus on the present moment. I felt like I couldn’t be depended on by my family and friends, because I didn’t know if I would be able to resist smoking weed on the day that they needed me for a favour. Now, I know I can plan ahead and be good for it, even if it happens to be on a bad day. My emotions are so much deeper, but easier to understand, and work through. And being happy is so much easier! I know when I wake up in the morning, feeling depressed, it doesn’t have to last, and there are things I can do, other than smoke weed, that will make me feel better, and my day can turn around.

Quitting weed was by far not the only solution in life I needed, but it was definitely a huge factor in how much better I feel today. I feel so much more capable of doing the things I need to to be happy with myself, and my life.

If you’re just starting out, or reading this and thinking of quitting - I’m here for you, thinking of you, and I know you’ve got the strength in you to do this. It takes time, but all you’ve got is time. For me, it felt so much harder to think about doing it, than actually doing it.

The last few months I have been trying to moderate my smoking - I am one of those people who cannot resist it if it’s in my house - by using a ksafe. It has really helped me limit my smoking to one day a week, and as a result my life has improved (overall). This week, for some reason, I thought that I could handle the moderation myself. Welp. Yesterday was my fourth evening hitting the bud and for whatever reason, I had THE WORST panic attack I’ve had in a while. Like waste the entire evening kind of panic attack. Luckily, I have a wonderful husband who is comforting and doesn’t make it embarrassing and understands that addiction and issues surrounding alcohol and drugs runs in my family. So, it’s back on the horse today. I locked it up and set the maximum date range for it and I’m going to try my best to continue to keep it locked until my birthday (in August). I don’t want to completely eliminate it from my life, I do enjoy it, but it is definitely time to take a step back from it again. I had been using it to substitute for alcohol consumption, but after last night I think my brain just needs an extended break from everything. This thread has  been a great help in the past and it is helpful knowing that I am not alone in my struggles. Thank you everyone here for your honesty, it provides hope for the rest of us.

38m - been smoking daily for over a decade, smoking in general since I was 14, then about 5 years ago moved to Colorado so I could get high even more. 

My peak before stopping after Monday (I had a brutal CHS vomiting episode) was (dab) 1-2 grams of concentrate daily. I'd buy an ounce of concentrates at least every month.

I thought after the vomiting went away Monday, that it would be smooth sailing from here on out.

- I'm having insane ""morning sickness"". I wake up today, go have some loose stool (it was diarrhea, so I guess it's improving), then proceed to feel like there's a beaver chewing my insides. Waves of mild to moderate stomach pain, and mild to moderate nausea that also comes in waves. Not sure if this is CHS ""recovery"", withdrawal, or both. Pepto helps a little.

- I can't sleep. like hardly at all. I'm having those nights where you don't really know if you slept or not.

- I can't eat. the thought of food disgusts me. I can drink though and seem incredibly thirsty.  Every once in a while I feel a small hint of hunger but it doesn't last.

I’ve grown as a person and the future is bright!,"I’m celebrating one year clean today! After many, many times trying and failing to quit, I have finally made it an entire year. Quit date was 3/11/19. 

A year later, I’ve seen myself grow and develop as a person. I can finally leave the house without getting high. My lungs (asthmatic) have healed and I can run a half marathon and barely need my inhaler anymore. I can be intimate with my husband without getting high first. My short term memory is still recovering, but it is far better than it was in the height of my addiction. 

It feels surreal to have gone an entire year without smoking. I was addicted and dependent on cannabis and I could not function without it. So many people in my life told me that weed was not addictive and shared stories about how they could just stop smoking at any time. And maybe that was true for them, but it was not true for me. Getting clean was a struggle and it took weeks of tapering off before I could finally put it down for good. 

I went to NA meetings (mostly online) for a few weeks after I quit and they helped so much. I’m not a religious person and was a skeptic about how much NA could help, but being surrounded by people who knew the struggle and wanted to support me made such a difference. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to at least try some form of addiction support group. If you don’t like it, you never have to go again. If you do like it, then it can help you. For the lurkers, even posting here on leaves and getting support can help you. 

I love you all so much and hope we can support each other in our recovery. Thank you leaves 💜

my girlfriend said i don’t need to feel like a failure for breaking my streak. she said that those 11 months mean something, and that i wanted to give it another try in a safe environment and it didn’t work out. so to be honest, i’m gonna keep the counter going. i’m proud of how far i’ve come, and i feel like i really know my body now.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.39200747}"

Amazing channel here by the way. Love the support and reading about others’ experiences. I’m now one week in sober after smoking heavily almost everyday for the past two years. 

The past week I’ve felt incredibly low. It’s like the happiness and life has been sucked out of me. I’m always paranoid and anxious about work and all other things going on in my life. 

Of course I’m aware this is normal and takes time but I just want to know, does it get worse than this before getting better? Can someone also explain to me why this is happening (something to do with the lack of dopamine now)? How have others dealt with this and how should I deal with it?

I'm not even thinking about weed, for the first time in *years*. It's great to just watch a funny video or eat a treat and not think ""this would be better high.""

My days are so much simpler not planning around being high. I don't avoid social interaction, work, or errands because I'm high.

I've settled into good habits that make my life feel full. I read and take my mind wonderful places. I exercise and push my body and feel great.

I'm sleeping so well and waking up so refreshed (although Daylight savings is fucking with that a bit this week). I'm having interesting, non-terrifying, silly, fun dreams.

Right now, quitting feels so much easier than a T-break. On a T-break, you're always thinking ""Is this long enough? Did I do good enough? Can I smoke again yet? Can I smoke tomorrow?"" But now things are very simple. I'm not waiting for anything. I'm not planning and holding on. I'm just doing me, the best version of me.

I think moderation would be way harder, more taxing, more time-consuming, more energy-consuming, than quitting at this point.

I'm willing for things to get harder again. I'm sure there will be difficulty spikes. And I'm sure there will be weeks, months, years, where I totally forget to even think about weed.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.79421484}"

I have had a few slips up here and there when I was drunk, but they were single occurrences.  Since stopping, I think about it a lot. Almost everyday.  This subreddit has definitely helped me.  I wanted to stop for a long time but the main reason I stopped was because it started giving me terrible panic attacks and I literally felt like I was gonna die.  On one hand I'm happy that it happened because I don't think I would have been able to stop if it didn't, but on another hand the anxiety hasn't gone away. I'm 23 and apart of me is worried that my brain has been permanently changed from this and won't go back to normal.  Is there anybody here who is in a similar situation, or has been away from weed for a while and doesn't feel anxiety anymore?  If you still feel anxiety, what ways do you cope with it?

While that aspiration declined, the call for public service never really left. For whatever reason, I graduated high school and went to College, got introduced to weed and kept the usage up daily for about 4 years.

I'm now out of College with a Finance degree but I'm just not happy at all. I can't see myself working at this desk for the rest of my life and I know there is something out there that'll give me a deeper satisfaction.  After some contemplation and meeting a few key people who have been a huge part of my life over the last 6 months, I've realized what I want to do is apply and ultimately join my cities Fire Department. Thankfully, the FD is more forgiving about marijuana usage than the Police. On paper, I look like a great candidate and friends I have made in the Department have told me the same thing. They require 6 months of being marijuana free. I'll be applying in January and last night was my last time smoking. Tonight is the first time I'll be going to bed damn near sober (I still dip and drink a beer or two in the evening, still working on that) in nearly four years.

I've been watching this THC cartridge drain for the past three weeks and it's been making me anxious knowing what was coming but now that I'm here, it doesn't really feel that bad. I've been doing long runs and intense gym workouts in the evenings for the past couple months in preparation for the physical tests I'll take and I'm hoping that'll take my mind off things. If nothing else, exhaust me enough so all I want to do is go to bed when I get home. I know I've got a battle ahead but I know I've gotta make some changes if I'm gonna become the person I know I can be.

It's honestly hilarious, I always told myself I wasn't a stoner because I waited to smoke til after 10pm but as I'm sure you all know, that's a fucking lie we tell ourselves to justify smoking.

Anyhow, this is a throwaway. Not because of the weed or anything, I just haven't told anybody about the FD and I plan to keep it that way until it looks like it's gonna pan out, especially since IRL friends know my account. Thanks for reading, and good luck to everybody else in this sub-reddit.

It's time to stop wasting my life and start saving lives.

Goals I've set for myself to keep my mind off of it:

-I'm getting rid of the computer in my room. For far too long it's been associated with smoking in the evenings. From now on, I want to enter my room in the evening and head straight to bed.

-I want to be a better uncle to my five nieces and nephews.

-I've always been a runner, I WILL run a half-marathon this spring.

-I've been mountain biking for four years now, this weekend I'm buying a road bike so I can ride even when the trails are wet. Another thing that'll keep me busy.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42872292}"

I basically regained my life from quitting and felt a million times better overall, with a sharper mind and better moods and relationships. I saw this relapse happening a couple weeks ago. I was doing well and then life just kind of got boring and mundane. I missed the instant dopamine response from the weed. I hit up a buddy out of town and we stayed at his place and smoked pot and drank. I’m not going to lie it felt nice to be high again but this relapse scared me. I literally drove almost 4 hours round trip to go to my buddy’s to smoke. If that’s not desperate then idk what is. I ended up spending my last $20 on acquiring more weed which was stupid af in retrospect. I guess I’m regretting my decision to smoke. One thing I’m worried about now is my parents finding out. My clothes smell like pot and I’m going to their house for spring break tomorrow. I really hope they don’t find out but a big part of me knows that there’s a big possibility they might.

The main reason I quit was to just see how I would do without smoking, I don’t feel as though I need to stop smoking but just to not allow it to have such a hold of me. I do have the motivation to quit but reading some of these posts makes me reconsider my approach. 

Before I quit I would get high before I did almost anything, I’m quite highly functional on pot and I don’t really notice too many side effects from being high all the time, i’m still able to study, work etc while stoned and often feel as though I need to be high to be focused. Being high helped me pick myself apart and really focus on what I needed to do to improve my life. Though I do believe that a lot of this is just myself trying to justify my smoking habits, I feel as though i’ve lost some of this ability since quitting. 

Since I quit I’ve been feeling a real lack of motivation to do anything, I can’t really sit down and study, video games are beyond boring, food sucks, and i don’t feel anywhere nearly as in touch with my emotions as I did whilst smoking. I’ve started smoking maybe 15 cigarettes a day (had maybe 1-2 maximum before only while working) and just generally don’t feel as good.

I know i’ve gone on a bit of a ramble here but has anyone else had success cutting back on their smoking rather than quitting all together, I wouldn’t say that it’s been hard to quit (so much easier than i thought) but I kind of just miss the release that weed gave me.

Yes, the initial withdrawals really sucked, I could not stop crying for the whole first week. Many suppressed memories flooded back, and I’ve had to call/text some people who deserved explanations & apologies from my mistakes. Appetite took a few days to come back, but now I’m eating regularly and not over-indulging for every meal. Also I lost all desire for soda. The munchies always made me crave it, now I’m drinking so much water that my weight has dropped, and it’s noticeable! I replaced all my free time from smoking with regular exercise, walking, occasionally hitting the gym and being outside as much as possible. And for those wondering about memory, it’s like I have gained my whole brain back, and moments are much more real than every minute being stoned.

It's tough every time but it always went away and I felt better after a few weeks. 

This time is different. It's been 3 weeks and I feel awful. I've had to take 3 separate mental health days off work because I just cant seem to get my shit together. My emotions are so negative amd always on my sleeve. I want to cry every day and sometimes I do. I exercise every day, I work a job that keeps me moving all day as well. It was always hard but not like this. I don't like the person I am acting like lately. I'm so mad at everything. My poor boyfriend has been putting up with so much shit from me. I feel like it's not worth it. 

The other day I broke. I went to a cannabis store and bought a 3 pack of joints. I smoked some, my boyfriend joined me which I feel horrible about as he and I have always been together on our quits, but that's a whole other thing. And I felt relief. The rock was quiet. It became easier to be happy. 

It's like there is a really heavy rock in my chest, and the closer or gets to the end of the day, the more the rock starts vibrating. It's so loud. It fills me with anger. I was never an angry person before and I really dont know how to deal with it. I've never felt such anger and despair until this quit. It doesnt make sense. My life is arguably better in so many ways do why do I feel like suck a miserable asshole. 

That's why I bought some. I'm tired of being a complete ass. I feel terrible for smoking again but I also feel so relieved to finally give myself a break. I smoked for 2 days in a row. I still have one joint left. 

Now here I am, didnt smoke today, sitting in here with the rock in my chest. And I'm angry. For no good reason. Can someone please relate to this?

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, just discovered this sub.  So basically I've been smoking for a few years to help manage anxiety.  I discovered medical weed and became pretty much enamored with cannabis, the culture, and the whole notion that grass is basically a  gift from God.

&#x200B;

So about a year ago I got this great job at a little dispensary as a budtender, living the dream right?  It was at that point that I started consuming all forms of cannabis ALL THE TIME.  For a while it seemed pretty great, until my tolerance maxed out.

&#x200B;

I literally reached a point where nothing would get me high anymore. Not dabbing, not even 200mg edibles.  No problem, just take a tolerance break right?  Nope, I tried a day or two here and there, and by the 3rd day I felt so awful I couldn't do it.  I would go and  smoke, not get high at all, but immediately feel relief..............a maintenance dose.  My therapist at the time told me I was addicted.  I laughed at them, quit therapy and continued smoking.

&#x200B;

So three days ago I had a bad day at work, had a terrible panic attack, tried to get high, nothing.  It then hit me that i've been smoking tons of weed for a long ass time without any effect.  I calmed down, picked myself up and went and had a LONG talk with my parents. I've decided to quit smoking, if only for the reason that weed doesn't work for me the way it does for other people.  Not getting high eventually gave me some clarity, if I could still get high I may never have even thought about my constant use, but I have and I need to stop.

&#x200B;

But now I'm left to sit and watch as my coworkers and customers smoke daily.  My coworkers claim they still get high, but do they really?  I believe weed has some medical qualities, but I'm skeptical.  I see people every day coming in to buy weed, abandoning doctors advice to get stoned.  So is this MY problem with weed?  Or is weed problematic to most, without them realizing it?

&#x200B;

Regardless, I'm only on day 4 of quitting. I feel mostly fine, but when I'm bored I get this crawling, cold, jabbing sensation down my back.  I feel like an junkie and am very conflicted about my job.  Sorry for the long post just looking for support. Thank you.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4081651}"

When I decided to quit I was smoking 2 grams or more a day, going through an ounce every 2 weeks. I have also have ADD and BPD and see a therapist and recently started seeing a new psychiatrist. When I was honest with my psychiatrist about how much weed I really was smoking, he realized I'd been abusing rather than just self medicating. Yes, weed did help me go completely off of my very high dose of lamictal (mood stabilizer).. but I was using so much and getting nothing accomplished. So after a week or 2 of denial I decided to smoke the rest of my pot, not buy more, and get rid of all my paraphernalia. I emptied my house of all weed related shit (or so I thought), and told myself I wasn't buying any more weed. The next day was my birthday, so I was gifted a quarter. No one forced it into my hands, or bowl..but I accepted, gladly. Then I told myself I was going to get baked and finish this quarter as quick as I wanted and theeeeen I'll be done, for real this time. I had my gifted quarter.. and the pipe I forgot I had stashed in my nightstand drawer until like... that convenient moment. So, smoke I did. 

I got to the last bowl like 2 or 3 days later, I loaded it into my bubbler, took 1 hit, didn't finish!! (Bc for some reason that made it better?), wrapped it (along with another pipe I'd found) in paper towels, ziploc baggie, and grocery sack and went outside and smashed it with a cast iron skillet. I knew if I simply threw it away I'd dig it out of the trash, and I know that sounds pathetic and disgusting, imagine how it makes one feel.. 

So I was done... 

until the next day, when I felt like shit, and knew a hit would make me feel better.. I also knew my neighbor wouldn't care if I slipped in and took a toke off her bong.. so for the next few days as I tried to quit, I'd make it like half a day, cave because I'd feel so much nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, make my way to her house and just have a couple hits. 

I've gone from 2 grams a day to a couple tokes a day but I want to be completely done.. 

Oh, and my neighbor got annoyed with me going over there too early, so I ended up getting my dugout back from where I'd stashed it, got a small amount from my dad (maybe a g) and here I sit.. 3 or 4 hits in for the day.. because I just need to eat something and keep it down.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44221815}"

Just like a lot of you guys, I love to play online video games. I play for a few hours every night before bed. I have always been the “silent team player”. I have my headset on, and I listen to everyone else talking. But I never chat or say anything. I always keep myself muted because I’m usually stoned and not in a talkative mood. (That seems to be how I am In person or online with weed).
But over the last 9 days my video games have been just as fun. If not more fun. (Not sure why I convinced myself I need weed to play) but I actually started chatting up with these random online players. 
And to be honest its been some of the best times. I played game after game. Chatting up with everyone being super friendly. Making friends. Having funny conversations with random players. I had a blast. 
I love video games. But can’t believe how much better they are when I’m not high as hell. 

Ill admit I still have the craving everyday to smoke. But now I’m starting to crave the human interactions more than the weed.

Still experiencing lots of brain fog, insomnia, anxiety, and irritability.  Depression comes in waves that are pretty intense some days. This week is a little better than last as far as temptations to smoke.  However, this is what I tell myself.

- If I smoke now it won't be the high I remember and loved.  58 days is not long enough for your brain to heal and chemistry to return to normal.  The fact that I'm still experiencing withdrawals is evidence of that.  

- If I smoke now, it will make me vegetable.  The high I want is that high that slowed down time and made everything funny.  That high that enhanced my creativity and appreciation for the arts. I've relapsed at about this point before and I know that is not what I will experience.

- If I smoke now, there's no way I'm going to be able to control it. Even if I tried to smoke only on weekends, that would leave me in a permanent state of withdrawal throughout the week.  Plus, I'd spend my weekends getting high instead of doing other things.  I might be able to power through and only smoke on weekends for a little while, but eventually I'd add Sunday night to my ""weekend"" and then Thursday.  Before I know it, I would be back to every day.

- If I smoke now, then the pain and suffering I've endured these past two months and that I'm still enduring will be all for nothing.  I won't get the high back that I miss and at the same time, I won't be able to test clean for a piss test.

- My writing and conversational skills still aren't 100%.  I'm still misspelling and using wrong words.  I desperately want these back.  If I smoke now, it won't happen.

- I'm still in too much of a brain fog to reconnect with my passions.  Life sober still seems too dull and boring.  If I smoke now, I'll never get my passions back.

- If I smoke now, I know that I'll immediately regret it.  Weed makes me introspective.  I know quitting is the right thing for me at this point in my life.  If I smoke, I'll be kicking myself for doing so and will have much less resolve to get back on the wagon.

- Nearly all of my current problems in life tie to weed in some way.  Why would I return to the thing that's the source of the problems I'm trying to move on from?

- Therefore, I'm committed to at least two years sober before I even consider smoking again.  I have to tell myself that it isn't for life and that one day I may be able to experience it again.  Just not now and not tomorrow.  I have to let myself heal and get out of this funk.  Once I've hit the two year point, I can evaluate my life then compared to how it is now and decide if weed really was benefiting me or if it was holding be back.  I think I already know what the answer will be, but we'll see.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54861206}"

2020-03-10 10:49:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fgey74/today_is_one_year/,Today is one year.,"Hello everyone!

So today is the day, I've made it exactly one year of living smoke free. I figured I'd write up a little thing for people who are struggling, need someone to relate to, or have questions.

I'll try to break down my situation and then follow up with what my expectations were vs. what happened and some overall thoughts on the many situations I came across. 

Sorry, but this is probably going to be a long one.

Some details, I just turned 37 at the end of February. I started smoking when I was 14, and I'd say around 28 I started smoking everyday. Around 30 or 31, it turned into smoking all day.

I work from home and my friend became a ""dealer"" around that time so it was way too easy to get what I needed.

I'd drop my wife off at work around 8am, smoke on the way home, do some work, smoke, clean the apartment, smoke, walk my dog, smoke, work some more or maybe get a little video game time in, smoke, pick my wife up from work, and laze around and smoke until bed.

My main reasons for quitting were financial and mental health (anxiety and depression). Both things are better today than they were a year ago.

* Ok so first off, the absolute worst part of the last 12 months was the very first month. I had trouble sleeping almost every night for a month.

* I could fall asleep decently, but I was waking up at 3 or 4 am and could never get back to sleep. This really took a toll on me. The first few weeks this was constant, then it started to slowly get better. There was no cure all, but I started drinking camomile tea and taking melatonin (not every night) before bed. It helped but wasn't life changing.

* The other major negative was bathroom issues the first two weeks. I already have had stomach issues since I was a kid but this was bad. Every day, multiple times a day I was on the toilet. It also retroactively made a lot of sense whenever I had taken vacation in the years prior, I always had problems because I never smoked on vacation. It only made sense when the same type of issues started happening those first two weeks.

* Another thing that wasn't a real issue, but could cause issues, my emotions were all over the place. I had a tendency to fall apart at the smallest things, and would sob during a movie at the slightest sad thing. I've always been fine with having a good cry but again this was another level. High point was seeing Avengers Endgame and wiping tears away for the last hour. It was confusing times.

* Cravings. So this was the most surprising aspect of this entire process. I had read up a lot here about having problems with craving to smoke. I can honestly tell you I had no cravings for a good six months if not more. And they were very slight, thankfully.

* What I did crave was less the actual smoking, and more the situational aspect, like my anniversary or Halloween. The fall is my favorite time of the year and I've had a lot of memories of smoking with my wife and going to pick pumpkins or hike, etc. Christmas was hard too because we would always wake up and smoke while opening gifts.

* I wasn't actually close to breaking, but moments like that, or driving around on a beautiful summer day, were the times I thought about it most often.

* I'm not necessarily clearer thinking like my wife feels she is. Now with that said, I never felt cloudy when smoking all the time, but my wife says she feels much better in decision making situations and overall.

* I do however have a much better grasp on my anger. I get less angry about ""stupid"" things, and when I do get angry, I make a much quicker recovery. On topic, if my wife and I have an issue I would usually shut down and not talk. Our communication has been much better, mainly because I don't retreat into my head and we discuss things. 

* I'm still lazy. This part is the biggest thing I thought would change. Now I'm better, but I'm still very much able to sit around and do absolutely nothing all day if I have the option. But it's still better than it was. I go out a lot more on weekends and such.

* To go along with that, I'm more social, although I still don't like it. I'm not a social butterfly and I never will be, but I do a lot more things outside and see some people more often. I'm also generally nicer to strangers and have even been known to actually talk to someone when they engage. I use to just mumble responses until they stopped. I wore a camp crystal lake shirt the other day and had a ten minute conversation about Friday the 13th with the lady making my sandwich. I would have absolutely not done that a year ago. 

* I haven't spoken to my close friend and ""dealer"" more than twice since I quit. He was a heavy smoker like me and was probably seeing him multiple times per month. We even stopped texting and playing games. He wasn't exactly receptive to me quitting, and was a little pushy about it. He even told me he didn't think it would last long-term. So that was a bummer.

* Last thing I can think of for now and I'll go with a positive. Board games. They have taken over my life in a good way. And not like Monopoly or the Game of Life, I'm talking modern games. There is a whole world out there and if you ever want to look into it you can check out r/boardgames or boardgamegeek.com

* They make my brain burn, they're great to play with my wife, they fill time well, and usually the value is greater than video games. We meet with another couple every month to play.we played Jaws last time and it was a blast. Time to start giving them some heavier games.

Ok, that was semi exhausting and I think All I can get out for now. I'm gonna out my phone down and go do some things, but it anyone has questions or whatever I'll be sure to come back and respond.

Now I'm back home and finding the cravings and urges to be more strong.

I have started reading as a newer hobby. There's a book by russell brand which i just picked up about addiction. I'm also going to get back into fitness more and start hiking more.

I had some really bad sleep paralysis last night where i thought i was going to stop breathing and die. i also felt something / someone behind me but it was just a hallucination from my dream state to awake state.

The past few years I never smoked a huge amount, but i did smoke almost every day, maybe just half a bowl a day. Whenever i did smoke i would end up just staying in my apartment. I'd be afraid to walk outside and leave my apartment. I would smoke and get paranoid. I would get high and then wonder why i got high if i didn't like the feeling and couldn't wait to come back down. But then the cycle would repeat and i would smoke again. i would mostly just smoke alone as being around others while high just gave me social anxiety. I think i mostly used out of boredom and to be content with just staying inside.

i have had some anxiety and have felt down and have had cravings ever since quitting. I know i need to stay strong. i have good family and friends in my life.

I am 18 years old and I have been smoking weed everyday since I was 15 years old. Four years ago my family lost everything in a house fire and my dad didn’t handle it well. He became a heavy drinker and it spiraled down quick. In February 2016, my father went into cardiac arrest. I quickly started smoking heavily as a terrible, but easy coping mechanism. Shortly after this my dog Stella was hit by a car and killed. My mom wasn’t handling this well either, and she became a severe alcoholic as well. I wasn’t any better than her, though.

The more and more I smoked, the more and more I set off my problems to the next day. These problems rooted themselves in my brain, manifested my soul and controlled my entire life. Where I was once a joyful, hopeful young man, I turned into a cold, miserable, heartless soul. I was sad all the time, suicidal, would snap at family members over the smallest of disagreements, want to fight my own friends, sleep all day: I had no quality of life.

Then comes along girlfriend. She was amazing. She put up with all my shitty habits, my anger, sleeping all day, and she only wanted to help. She tried to get me to go to counseling, get a doctors appointment and held me when I wanted to cry. Everything she did revolved around making me happy. But I still wasn’t. I still smoked everyday & I put off every bit of advice she gave me. I snapped at her the same way that I snapped before at my mother, my brother, my friends. Because that’s what I do. She deserved nothing but love and respect, and I gave her bullshit. She came over to my dorm yesterday and told me she just couldn’t be with me anymore. She told me she loved me and we hugged and cried for hours. I couldn’t be mad at her, I knew I was terrible. Now, when it’s too late, I just want to scream how sorry I am. I love that girl so much, she was the only thing good in my life.

I felt that getting high was the only thing numbing the pain. I am terrified of the all too familiar darkness that comes with sobering up. But I am ready for that. I have set an alarm for midnight, for at midnight I will no longer be smoking weed. No more nicotine. No more sleeping until 2 P.M., and for gods sake no more fucking excuses. I can’t feel this way anymore. I either have to pick myself up and fight this, or it is going to kill me.",342,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.716117}"

Then a friend got really depressed and our HPPD kept increasing. He got a mental breakdown with words like I am going to kill myself, and I was tripping on BOH-2C-B on that moment. Although I didn’t freak out it made it really clear that I had to stop. And now for real.

I could see the damage I was doing to myself, and the damage it has done to him. 

I really believe that weed is for me the harderst drug of all. It’s the only drug (of more than 50 drugs I tried) that I am addicted too and I have brain damage from. I hate /r weed now, they al thing weed is this plant that’s not physically addictive (and it definitely is, see all the withdrawals people have here). 

I got a strange kind op HPPD from weed (psychedelics don’t even increase my HPPD while weed does strongly)..

I never used to escape, I have a great life tbh. It was just there and everyone did it. Not I hate myself for not using it sometimes but using it all the time.

Also, the first day of quitting I already felt better instead off worse (don’t really mind the withdrawals, and even while I sleep a bit worse I rest better). Now I feel like I am on speed and have al the motivation in the world.

It just worries me that I wil maybe start hallucinating after day 30, because of my strange reaction too weed. (It has a stronger headspace than a good dose of LSD for me). Also the visuals are prettty strong.

Just wanted to write this, and to show that weed is not that much better than other drugs.

I have questions for those of you who have particularly suffered from psychological symptoms when you first quit?,"All I ask is that you please do not judge me for anything I say... I am asking for help, advice, support and to find an incentive to recover. 

I have a lot of issues going on for me. The main thing that is affecting me in my life are my emotions and my personality disorder. I also have a mood disorder (PDD) as well as anxiety issues and problems with communicating and socialising sometimes, and I believe I may be on the spectrum. So basically, my emotions are fucked. 

So I've been reliant on pot now for about 3 years. I know a lot about how it affects the mind and whatnot. What has scared me the most lately is how much my cognition has dropped and how I am no longer capable of complex thoughts or emotional coping skills. My memory is also shot too. I can't even remember long-term stuff anymore. And the scariest part about this? I have started a course recently and I am a student again (Cert IV Mental Health) and only now is it starting to dawn on me that my cognition is most certainly impaired. I have been having problems already, but thankfully I have the benefit of getting more time on work and stuff with assignments. We also have to do these role plays and that's where I stuffed up, last week. I was unable to gain a pass for a role play assessment due to a mixture of not being prepared due to one of my animals going missing. So I flunk out, but apparently others did too, so I guess it's not all bad. But I am still worried about my cognition failing me when I need it most. 

I also might have a job soon so I am hoping this will end up keeping me busy enough for me to realise that I don't need this substance in my life. I have realised that a lot of it is psychological. That does NOT make it any less real, though. Oh hell no. I get a sense of doom and despair when I think about quitting. The feeling is impossible to explain properly but maybe some of you get where I am coming from.   


I also have questions for you guys.

&#x200B;

1. For those of you who have quit pot after long-term smoking and managed to stay sober. Tell me what the first month was like, particularly the first 1-10 days, psychologically speaking (anxiety, depression, bad thoughts, sense of doom)?
2. Do you find NA meetings useful? What do/did you get out of going to them and following the 12 steps? Did having a sponsor help? 
3. Take me through your *sudden realisation* that made you realise that you just HAD to quit pot?
4. If you got urges to go back to smoking, what did you do to stop the craving/urge? What worked for you?
5. When you got really bad mentally during withdrawals, such as a mental breakdown, how did you manage? What did you do?
6. How long did it take you, once you quit, to realise fully that you 100% don't need weed to live your life with satisfaction and purpose? 

Basically, any advice or support is greatly appreciated. I feel stuck and trapped in my life with no ability to move forward. Help?",32,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8861173}"

So I thought I'd share my experience in my first week of no smoking after 5 years of fairly frequent use, the last 2 or 3 years I have been getting stoned daily.

Well I'm 25 and lately I've been reflecting a lot on my childhood. I work in mental health so on a daily basis I'm confronted by people who have had abusive childhoods. and on day 6 of no weed I saw a YouTube video

https://youtu.be/95ovIJ3dsNk

Which reminded me of a study I had learnt about while I was doing my degree a few years ago. The study basically showed that from a 10k plus sample size, participants who could recognise ""adverse childhood experiences"" or ACE's as they are termed, had a higher chance of developing not just mental health conditions but physical health conditions too. I looked up the ACE criteria online and was surprised to find that my childhood experiences put me in the highest risk category. 

As someone who grew up with a schizotypal father, whom had left a few times, came back, been hospitalised or ""sectioned"" as it is known. And a Mother who I often heard calling my father derogatory names ""basket case"" saying things such as ""no one will ever love you - you're round the bend (UK London slang for insane) ""  who once poured a kettle of boiling water over his head while he was relaxing in his armchair.... Well for the first time in my life I finally recognised this as legit abuse.

It must sound strange to some as this is blatant abuse, and on a handful of occasions it got physical. However it has taken me this long to verbally tell this truth out loud to my partner. Prior to this I'd always dismissed the abuse; it wasn't like I was getting beaten up or molested and since I work in mental health I am privy to information on many mentally ill people's childhood history which is often horrific and unimaginably abusive. Experiences that I used to think dwarfed my own experiences of abuse as a child.

Maybe after 6 days of sobriety I was allowed the clarity and the attention span to explore these issues within myself. It had occurred to me somewhat before but I felt a weight off my shoulders when admitting the real nature of my childhood after watching that video with a clear head.

If anyone on here trying to quit feels they have a dark hole inside of them, or anger and bitterness around their childhood and parental relationships, I encourage you too to watch the above video when sober and to take the ACE test. And just sit with the feeling that occur.

It's okay to admit that your childhood was far from perfect. You may not have been locked in a room and starved or beaten everyday but that doesn't invalidate your pain. And in admitting this reality to yourself, may you be free from any blame or guilt or inadequacy you may be feeling as a result.

!! I know this is on another note entirely but since quitting I've been experiencing really frequent uncontrollable muscle twitches! First in my right arm, then in my leg, and then last night my eye lid kept twitching throughout the night. A part of me wonders if this is a strange psychosomatic reaction to my recent revelation or perhaps also a minor side effect of weed withdrawal.

Let me know if you've experienced anything similar?!

If you've read this whole post then I thank you and I hope it's offered some food for thought.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6768939}"

I remember smoking in the rain with my closest friends. We were truly enjoying life to its fullest. It enhanced everything around us and we would spend hours talking to eachother about life. I even remember quipping ""why do older people seem to stop? Why would anyone ever give up something so amazing?""

But eventually I didn't just smoke to enhance life. In many ways I used it to escape pain, and I think that's where it all went south. I used to joke that my superpower was ""I couldn't ever get too high."" This was in stark contrast to my close smoking friend, who was prone to intense anxiety and literal testicle pain if he smoked too much. I still, to this day, fucking love telling people that this man still smokes even though it causes acute ball pain. I find it so devilishly hilarious. I even remember the days Currents came out we took a trip up to the local Creek and on the way back down we had to pull over because he couldn't handle the car ride.

This same friend once jokingly asked me, ""what are you running from, man?"" And the truth was, almost everything. At some point I began to feel the need to suppress my emotions and I had found the perfect way. It became quite apparent that I was no longer smoking recreationally. I devolved into an all day every day stoner because I was able to work it into my lifestyle.

Once I became aware of the downsides, it was almost torturous. Ignorance was truly bliss. I'm not even 100% sure if it's smoking itself that is bad, or if it's believing that smoking is bad for me and continuing use regardless. This wasn't the first time I felt shame over an addiction. I used to play WoW as a teen and a large part of the community bemoaned the opportunity cost associated with ""nolifeing"". Regardless, there are some pretty definite physical degredations that are at least correlated with use in my case.

Since I first started 6 years ago I haven't gone more than two weeks without smoking. Except this last try.

Is it withdrawls? ¡Por que no los dos!,"If I'm honest with myself, I've known I needed to quit smoking for some time now. Every quarter was going to be my last; I gave myself so many circumstantial reasons to buy another.This morning while doing some research about how to quit I stumbled onto this page, and it's been the push I've needed to finally quit cold turkey. I can't even express how thankful I am to the whole community for that. 

Even though I'm really excited and I know in my heart this is the right choice for me, I'm already struggling a lot. I haven't smoked for very long-I started about 2 1/2 years ago just before I turned 21-but became a heavy user almost instantly. Before that point, I had been completely sober from all substances my whole life. Not only that but I've experienced a lot of trauma over the course of my life and suffered from intense anxiety and panic disorder for as long as I can remember. 

For awhile, being stoned was a life-changing experience. It was the only thing that helped abate my anxiety. It helped me get to a place where I could work through my trauma. It helped me kick an eating disorder I didn't know I had. Lately, though, it has done nothing but prevent me from improving my life, just allowing me to slip into complacency when I experienced discomfort. 

In this moment, I am just about 24 hours sober. Realizing how different my mind and body feels already has honestly been shocking in terms of how truly dependent on this substance I had become. The biggest thing I've noticed (and the thing that scares me the most) is that my anxiety is pretty out of control. I'm doing my best to engage in calming activities I used to pair with weed, but it really isn't the same. Even after reading through others experiences with PAWS, I can't shake the feeling that the anxiety isn't from withdrawls, it's just my own shitty baseline. A huge part of why I wanted to quit in the first place is that I had a dissociative episode for the first time a few days ago that made me have a panic attack. At the time, I blamed the weed. Now that I feel the way I do, it's really shaking my confidence and making me feel like I'm the problem, not the smoking. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for from this post, other than to have my truth out there in the universe with people who care and relate in some way. Maybe reassurance that my brain isn't broken and that some day my anxiety may be actually manageable would be nice too. Heck, even some tips to manage while I get through the thick of it would be awesome. I've done so much work to manage my mental illness in the last year, and I'm so nervous it's all going to go out the window now that I'm sober.

Within that time I started smoking again I smoked not a little, but every single day until I had a very very bad panic attack. Then after the panic attack, I tried again and almost died. My heart rate was so elevated.
I was then clean for 8 days after the second panic attack, tried smoking again. And same thing, another panic attack.
I hadn’t really been smoking pure weed either, what induced the attacks was that I was smoking weed sprayed/soaked in K2 unknowingly and once I started to put the pieces together I was overcome with fear.
When I tried it again it was my friends weed who was also unknowingly laced.
I live in a really poor ghetto city where weed is not legal so it being laced with other substances like K2 let’s dealers sell bad quality for more and sell it off as gas.
Most dealers don’t even know that the stuff they have is messed up either, it’s very hard to tell. But once you do research, you notice.
The effects, the smell, it’s not right. It’s terrifying.

But the act of smoking was such a ritual habit for me without it my days just seemed to drag on. I didnt know how to be sober and live life sober without being bored out of my mind. I smoked because I had nothing better to do and no reason to quit. 

Then one day after many weeks of smoking and instantly regretting it I finally realized that just because I dont HAVE to stop smoking doesn’t mean I dont NEED to. It had such a hold on my life and my wallet that would would sacrifice expenses like haircuts or groceries to put the money towards my smoking. Then I thought about having to eventually get clean to pass a drug test for the job I wanna eventually get. It will takes months at this point.

I'm 26, been smoking since I was 15, had a sober year when I was 18, but other than that I was high every day. Been breaking the pattern for two - three years, sometimes sucessfully, other times not so much. 

Was riding a nice wave last year, where I always had weed on me but didn't smoke at all for weeks, and when I eventually did, I didn't relapse. For some reason having the ability to smoke at all times but choosing not to do so makes it easier for me. Feels sort of self empowering.

Went through a music festival with everyone around me smoking constantly, without any issues, felt great. Smoked like 1 Joint that whole week. 

Broke my leg shortly after. Bored shitless. Started smoking again. Went ""shit what the fuck happened"" when 4 months were over, just like that, in a blink of an eye. 

*Love* stuff happens, it's complicated, as these things somehow always are. Need to escape this haze, can't get a single clear thought through my head, the fog is just too dense.

I'm sick of numbing myself, all this potential, wasted, literally, (haha), makes me sad in a cold sort of way.

And that brings us to the present day. Day two of not smoking, I'm a fucking mess. The thing is, this is objectively a hard time to stop for me right now, because my brain's going haywire already for non weed related reasons mentioned above, which is precisely why I **need** to stop, kind of like a positive feedback loop. 

Anyway, drinking one beer, staring at my phone screen in anticipation of news from *her.* Trying to stay sane. Gathering my thoughts in this post seems to be helping.

I was a tour guide back then, I loved chatting with people and teaching/giving historical information. The last few years, I have been struggling with social anxiety. I choose to believe I developed it because of my weed lifestyle. Limited friendships, let many amazing opportunities pass by, stayed in vs going to do actual things outside of the home, leaning into weed because of uncomfortable/stressful situations etc. Back when I was 20 I thought I was in control of my life, somewhat extroverted. Nowadays, I’m taking that control back - slowly but surely. I’m confused to what my personality is, but I have a good base for what I value and who I want to be.

Weed creates a mindset that it is fun or cool to be stagnant. It’s quite freaking lame tbh. I will stay the path im on now and grow, develop my mind, my personality and add to my values. I hold quite a bit of shame from being this stagnant shell of a person I was, it has cost (friendships, lovers, opportunities)me a lot. Being self aware now, I can be in control of how I will be moving forward.

I honestly love weed and I like the way that it relaxes me and makes me at peace with myself. The reason I want to quit though is that I am a college student, I really feel like weed has had a serious negative effect on my memory and my school, and I think it severely affects my motivation. I have a lot of goals and aspirations, and I think that for me, weed is getting in the way. 

that being said, it sucks because weed is such a social drug for me. I hardly ever smoke alone, almost every time it is with my friends, my roommate, or my girlfriend. for some of my friends, the only thing we really do when we hang out is smoke weed and play videogames/watch movies. I feel like if I were to stop smoking, I could risk that friendship since it has become such an integral part of our relationship. On top of that, my girlfriend is a huge advocate for weed and loves smoking all the time with me, she always tells me how smoking w/me is one of her favorite things to do. 

anyways, I just need some tips and encouragement about quitting. I haven't quit yet, but there is a voice in my head that has been telling me to quit for a long long time. I just haven't had the courage to actually go through with it. thanks <3",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45090318}"

I quit cold turkey following a heart attack scare two weeks ago, and since then, I've had some weird symptoms that resemble what I fear might be a brain tumor or some sort of neurological disorder. 

The symptoms that make me most nervous are the fact that I have what feels like pressure on the left side of my head, and tension that makes it somewhat difficult for me to type and write like I used to. However, it's hard for me to tell if I'm just psyching myself out over the head pressure, as I've tricked myself into believing I was experiencing pain that wasn't really there before in the past. My handwriting has become rigid and I make a lot of mistakes typing; these weren't really present before I quit, but again, it's hard to tell. 

Second, and not surprisingly, I have crushing anxiety. To the point where I've had to drop classes, and am afraid to go outside for fear of having a breakdown. This was really intense for the first few days, but has since subsided, and now I only have moderate anxiety that is persistent but seldom full-blown panic attacks.

Could you share your recipes of success, words of wisdom or literally anything at all that helped you on your way to quitting weed? How did you manage to find your long lost motivation? I feel like I am motivated only to get high ;(((","I honestly don't know if I will ever be able to say ""no"" to this devilish bittersweet plant that has made me love it more than anything else.

I am struggling to find motivation to quit smoking weed even though I know I should cause I am an addict. Forthe past 5+ years I live from joint to joint and the only thing that makes me happy is getting weed and getting high. I smoke on avg 2gr/day and I plan my life accordingly - I hardly ever go to places where I can't light up. I work from home, so I can get high all day every day and I almost don't have to go out at all except for food which I sometimes avoid too cause I am too high to go to a store. I have friends who smoke too (although not nearly as much as me) and they are not stereotypical weed-buddies, they are actually good friends that I've known almost my entire life and they are people who got their lives together (they have a job they enjoy or a career they are pursuing, they are either in steady relationships or married, they have healthy hobbies).

One part of me wants to change and that part usually comes out when I buy a big pack of weed knowing that I won't do anything except getting high and playing stupid games for the next few days. I feel guilty and that's the only time I have these thoughts about quitting weed. But the moment I see I am running out of weed I feel like I can't do this. I don't know how to live my life without it. And the worst part is I feel like I don't like anything anymore (except the obvious ofc). Despite the fact that I hate what I do right now, I don't want to find a job where I'll have to socialize or show that I care cause I couldn't give less shit about companies and their goals. I don't feel like socializing with my own friends anymore, god forbid I have to meet new people. I don't feel like meeting new guys either despite the fact that I've been single for 10 years. I feel like I've given up on everything in my life :(( 

There was a time when I was high and I still had some motivation - I started learning new skills in order to change career, I went on a few job interviews last year and got rejected that I started wandering whether I will ever be able to learn whatever I need to learn to land a job that I actually like or every fucking HR on this world requires you to have 5 years of strictly relevant experience. I went on a couple of dates last year but I wasn't interested in them enough to be in a relationship. I feel like whatever I try fails, the only thing that doesn't ever fail me is my good friend Mary Jane and the vicious circle continues. I fail. I fail hard and I can't cope with trying and being a failure, it seems to me that it's easier to just give up entirely and accept the fact that I am a mf addict and live my life as one until I die...

Please, please, tell me how did you make it? How did you manage to find motivation to do anything besides getting high?

I know there is still a sprinkle of motivation in me or I wouldn't be posting this. Last week I made myself (correction: forced myself) go and buy gym equipment so I would feel guilty if I don't start going to gym. Well....today should be the day I should start going to gym...I still don't want to do it to be honest, I don't see a point in it, but I am going to force myself anyway. I just wish I knew for how long I have to force myself in order for me to start actually enjoying it...


Btw. I would pay a therapist or enroll a course to help me with my skills but I don't have money for that, at least not right now. I live in a ""second-world"" country and I don't earn much. I get my weed from my dealer who knows me for years and gives me big discounts cause I got him many new customers so it has become easy for me to get high for not that much money. I could pay a therapist if I stopped smoking for a month and saved that money, but right now weed+therapist=no food.

I always liked weed and never really saw it as a problem. I only stopped because I started feeling extreme nausea as soon as I woke up and then all day for over a week and got worried I was developing CHS. 

I figured it'd be best to quit before the cyclic vomiting started if that was truly what it was. After quitting and looking through this sub for a while I realized the other effects weed had had on my life that I'd been blind to until then. 

You've heard it all before, withdrawing from social circles, scheduling my life around smoking, not getting joy from anything unless I was high, etcetera etcetera. I realized how much I used to love truly being high, and how much smoking regularly made those highs completely unobtainable. 

When I decided to quit, I did so with 30 days as my goal. I had never taken any kind of tolerance break before. Now that I'm almost two weeks out, I've noticed the benefits of quitting. I never really got most of the withdrawal symptoms I read about so much on here. No extreme depression, anxiety, or really even intense cravings. I had loss of appetite (I lost maybe 10 pounds and was already skinny) and pretty bad night sweats for about a week but otherwise it's been smooth sailing. Maybe it's because I wasn't a chronic user for as long as some people on here who've quit. 

The only problem is I'm not sure I'm totally ready to say goodbye to weed for good. I'd love to be able to just smoke on special occasions and achieve that true high I originally fell in love with. I'd like to think that I would be able to just do it once, enjoy it, and then go back to living life sober until the next special occasion. It feels naive to think that though, after reading so many stories of people smoking ""once"" and slipping back into days long habits. I've also found that I've been drinking alcohol more often (I used to never really drink) because it's a way to alter my mental state without smoking. So that has me concerned because I know it's not healthy. 

I know no one on here will ever tell me ""go ahead and reward yourself after 30 days! It'll be fine!"" So I'm not really sure what I'm looking for in this post. Maybe just some anecdotes? Has anyone had success with moving from chronic use to moderation? I've had nightmares where I smoked again and got super depressed because I ""threw away my sobriety"" and then woke up relieved. So that makes me hesitant to start again, but like I said I don't think I'm ready to say goodbye for good when I'm still so young. It doesn't help that I'm in Michigan and the first adult use dispensary in my city just opened less than a mile away from me right after I quit...

I’ve been on this sub for probably two years and have just started my journey after 8 years of daily smoking, the last of which was a cry for help. I’m not sure why I expected someone else to come to the rescue. 

My body aches, and sure a J right now would loosen me up. But so would a few stretches before I go up to bed. 

I had one of the most sincere conversations with my wife I’ve had in years tonight. I let her know that I am struggling with depression and anxiety. That I was masking it with cannabis abuse. That I hurt, and don’t want to feel like this again. Our sons are too important. She is too important. I’m getting help, and I want her along for the duration right beside me. 

But here we are. I’m doing okay and I’m not craving that j. So in short...

Having to have dinner with my gf's mom, dad, brother, sister in law and two kids. I ended up sleeping most of that day away, feeling angry, and then guilty for feeling angry. I eventually told my GF that I didn't want to come and she knew that I was struggling so fortunately I managed to stay home, stay sober, chilled and did some chores, listened to some music that I enjoy and just stay as relaxed as possible.

Going to see her family is always hard for me because. Well. They are so supportive, nice and loving and It just makes me feel disgusted(!) since growing up in a dysfunctional family. It just makes me a bit jealous if I'm honest. I find myself sitting around the table literally simmering with rage.

What else has made this week difficult is the fact that i started using Myfitnesspal to limit my calorie intake and to be honest.. In the last like 3 years I've been addicted to sugar and salt and fat. Emotional eating (and as a consequence spending) has caused my finances to become dire, and my once above average health to deteriorate... As well as effecting my mental health. I have followed my plan until day 6. But apart from that it's been okayish. 

Asides from this, the week has been manageable, I actually have been enjoying things such as 

- dog walking (I don't have a dog but I walk other people's dogs via the website borrowmydoggy.com.)

- playing Pokémon Go

- unwinding and relaxing in the bath (candles and bath salts included)

My original quit date was 01/13/2019.,"So it’s been over a year since I’ve started this journey and like many of us here, I have not been able to quit. This last year has been a rollercoaster of relapse, quit, and start again. I have underlying mental issues I will have to deal with. These issues  started to come out the time I quit for 45 days. I’m a 32 yo male who is likely to have borderline personality disorder, if not, something closely related. My father was diagnosed with it and I fit the criteria very well. Along with this disorder, it’s usually accompanied with substance abuse, anxiety, and impulsive behavior, among other unpleasant things. I have an appointment with a psychologist in 2 months. Another reason I want/have to quit now.

Weed helped me with the quick sudden burst of anger, made me more empathetic, and allowed me to see a calmer side. That would last for about 2 hours until I came down and my mood would suddenly switch. I would be tired by the hangover and binge eating, I had no coping energy left and would go into horrible mood swings, and through the cycle that is present with borderlines. Nonetheless, I don’t want to do it anymore and I actually enjoy fighting some of those demons with a clear head. I had gone a couple of weeks and more than a month once this last year from using. In that time I would start controlling my mood and trying to adjust, and then I would think about how I could use again😕. The cycle would repeat as we all know. So no matter what my traits are, how my personality is, it’s time for the world to see who I am, not the numbed out version. I can’t mask who I am anymore.

Go for it!,"I found reading the posts here to be helpful when quitting smoking. I figured I’d share my experience in the hope that it might help others in their mission to ditch weed... 

For reference, I smoked for 4.5 years. Daily for the last 3 years. 55 days free as I write this. 

I’ll start with a chronology of what it’s like to quit so you know what you might experience, and later on in the post I’ll write some more about how to get yourself psyched up for quitting and into that “fuck this” mindset! 

Here’s how it went for me... 

Day 1) It feels a bit surreal. 8pm rolls round and your instinct is to seek out some weed and smoke. Resist!!! Do something else - ideally something that will tire you out physically. You might (prob will) have trouble sleeping tonight. But guess what? You’re solid and you aren’t gonna bitch out and cave are you? No!!! Good. Your body and mind are used to being in a chemical slumber when you fall asleep. Tonight your mind is drug free and it feels like your thoughts are going 100mph! Don’t worry, it gets much easier. 

Day 7) You’ve been having crazy dreams because your body is re adjusting to having proper, healthy REM sleep. Your mental and physical ability to regenerate and repair is already much better. You’ll feel much sharper mentally. Because you’ve been smoking weed chronically, you begin to realise how much it’s been holding you back and feel like you’re the fucking guy off limitless, working at 120% capacity hahaha

Week 3) Up until this point, you’ve been painfully aware of the fact that days feel like they’re 40 hours long. You’re coming to the realisation that normal people (aka non weed addicts) actually do stuff like sit and watch TV on their own, go to the gym and then go to bed. Up until this point, you’ve been looking at the calendar daily wondering why only 1 day is passing when each day feels like 3. 

At this stage, you are realising with a crazy sense of “wtaf” how insane the concept of smoking weed every single day is in a cult of weed smokers. You realise how strange your defending of weed and weed smokers must have sounded to non-stoners. 

Week 4) At this stage, you are elite non-weed smoker and are basically out of the woods. You stop doing the weird calendar-watching and stop caring about how long you haven’t smoked in. You have absolutely no desire to smoke weed anymore. You might find yourself around people smoking weed again at this stage but have the ability to say no. It feels great. 

Week 7) You now realise that by not smoking weed, you have lots of spare time. You are much more efficient and motivated to do small jobs and engage in productive activities such as working out and attending clubs etc. You also realise you are about £100 better off every single week which is the equivalent of getting a 5 grand pay rise at work... tell me that isn’t a good incentive eh!?

Here’s the secret: 

The difficult part of quitting is getting yourself to a place (mentally) where you are 100% ready to leave weed behind and move on with your life. 
The whole NOT smoking the weed bit is actually surprisingly easy!

For me, the hardest part was psyching myself up for D-day where I was gonna quit cold turkey. It seems like the scariest idea at the time but once you do it, you’ll realise how little you actually had to worry about! Go for it!

Once you are in the frame of mind where you’re ready to leave it behind... you are in the drivers seat and in total control of your weed-smoking behaviours! 

Conversely, short term, ‘knee-jerk’ attempts to quit are destined to be exactly that - short lived and doomed to fail. 
These can be disheartening, however, like cig smokers and any other form of addict, it often takes a number of failed attempts before a successful attempt is made. If this is you right now... persevere! 

You need to understand that YOU and ONLY YOU can stop smoking. Nobody else is gonna do it for you. 

I used a bit of a self-hatred and asshole approach to help me quit. 
Every time I thought about giving in and smoking, I’d tell myself off. Am I really so weak that I will give in? I’m not addicted to heroin I’m trying to stop smoking a non-physically addictive drug here. Be realistic about what it is I’m trying to achieve. 
Think of the insane feats human beings can achieve under crazy stress and shitty circumstances. I have no excuses if I’m to bitch out at this. 

My close friends at the time (who are also heavy weed smokers) continued to smoke. I forced myself to completely avoid them and the weed-smoking environment because I knew it would be much easier if it was out of sight & out of mind. 
To them, I seemed like a dick on my tee-total high horse completely avoiding them. They would send me messages and photos smoking and try to encourage me to join them once more. I got the “cold shoulder” a bit as though id decided to turn my back on the cult. As much as part of me wanted to cave and re-join the safe, familiar environment - I resisted. The saying “misery loves company” is extremely relevant here. Me and my friends were validating each-other in our unhealthy weed smoking habits. 

I turned this negative into a positive.   
While they approached my abstinence with a “haha bet you really wish you were smoking weed like us right now” attitude, I would tell myself that I AM better than them with each passing day I didn’t smoke. 

I wanted to think: 
 “I’m missing out because I’m not smoking with them” 

but the reality is: 

“they are missing out because they are continuing to smoke” 

They were too weak to have the bottle to give it up. I wasn’t. This sense of strength and accomplishment felt great and encouraged me massively to keep going. 

The sad thing is, they didn’t want me to smoke with them because they missed my company, it was more about validating their bad habits. If we all did it together it wasn’t quite as bad! 
I’m happy to say that since then, one of my friends has since had a very similar epiphany much like mine and also packed in the smoking. This I’m very glad of. He said my decision to stop made him look at his own habits and realise how unhealthy they were impacting his life in his own unique way different to mine. I don’t have any resentment towards them as their behaviour was just a projection of their insecurity and desperation to be validated in their weed smoking. We’re still friends and I just don’t smoke if I’m around the ones who do now. 

Now for an overall thought... forgive me if this is a bit deep. This is just my perception and way of rationalising my decision to stop. 

I’m a strong believer that life is what you make of it. Every one of us has the choice to smoke weed or not to smoke weed. Ask yourself what kind of people smoke weed habitually? Is that the person I want to be? In my case, the answer is no. 

Is it making my life better or worse as a whole? Objectively ask yourself. 

We know that poor and disaffected people tend to have these kinds of destructive habits and ultimately they’re doing them to escape something. Whether this is poverty, a shit job, shit social support system or whatever, that’s the general consensus. It’s the same for hard drug users and the majority of alcoholics. How many successful happy people with beautiful wives and holiday homes in the alps sit in the dark and smoke weed for 6 hours a night? Virtually none. Ask yourself why...

The sad truth is that the most vulnerable people who do these things find it the hardest to break this cycle, but by stopping the destructive habits and investing time and energy into fixing the broken parts of your life - you have a much higher chance of being happier than if you continue down your dark spiral of substance misuse and self loathing! 

If you’re constantly hard-up and/or unhappy with the way your social life is (much like I was/am to an extent), smoking weed all the time is like shooting yourself in the foot- big time. 
Successful, healthy women (if you’re a guy) are uninterested in you because you’re a sad stoner in their eyes, no matter what way you perceive yourself. If you keep it a secret like I did, then you’re leading a fkn double life and it’s like having a secret mistress who you have to make time for on the side hahaha.
If you’re poor, spending your last £100 on weed and cigs seems like a reasonable idea. Multiple small releases of dopamine in a sad reality beats sitting at home bored with nothing to do. My advice is to reinvest your time and cash other places and the rest will slowly begin to fall into place. 

The rich non weed smoker with his holiday home and white picket fence house may well be in that position because he is much more lucky and privileged than you or I. By smoking weed chronically, we widen the gap between him and us. By stopping our destructive habits and reinvesting our time and energy other places, we can (to some degree) level the playing field and also have happy, productive lives.

I stopped smoking weed and spent the spare money on a gym membership and starting climbing. By doing this, I’ve automatically given myself a massive personal identity change. I’m now the gym goer and climber, not the sad weed smoker who has nothing going for him! 

Sorry if this is a bit long winded. There are other things I wanted to add but didn’t want to ramble (any more than I already have). The last part is my perception of reality and might not align with how you lot see constant weed use. That’s totally fine. Some people can use it in moderation and others still stand by it and defend it to the death. I’d say to them... try taking two weeks off and see if you still feel the same about your habits.

I thought I should share this here. I (24 f) started smoking about a year and a half ago and it quickly escalated into everyday use. I couldn’t be sober. I smoked all day every day. I would often say “I can’t do this” when I was upset about anything at all and exclaim “I need to smoke” the second I walked through the door after work. I started smoking because I was facing some personal issues that I didn’t have the tools to effectively deal with. My marriage (we got married at 21) wasn’t what I expected it to be and my husband and I were really facing some difficult times. 

Fast forward to New Years Eve 2020, my husband told me he had been struggling with severe depression and had felt like I wasn’t really around to talk to about it because I was always high off my ass. 

I cut down my usage to only weekends immediately and then 5 weeks ago I smoked my last j. The first two weeks are definitely the hardest. Last night, I had a house party and the weed was flowing. I was even outside while my friends were smoking and I didn’t even want to smoke. 

Life is so much sweeter without weed my friends. I use the be sober app and this is my personal reason for being sober: 

“You have let marijuana shape your life, your friendships and your mindset. Let your mind and body heal. Connect with yourself and learn to trust your intuition.

I've finally hit the big one year milestone that I set for myself the day I'd had enough of the devils lettuce. 365 days is a long time, but it has honestly been the quickest year of my life. A part of me tells me that's just because I'm getting older, but I also think it's because I'm busy like I have not been before. And being busy, making action, has been the main antidote to my despair.

I'm 25 years old, and I've made some tremendous progress in my career as a teacher.   
I started out with being a part time helper on qualifying IT-courses, and now I'm full-time and making double the salary I did last year. I'm also teaching my main subject of interest, marketing - which has been a huge boost to my motivation to excel at work. In my personal opinion, a subject that you care about are far easier (and better) to convey to others.

The road has been seriously tough at times. I am, and will never be perfect in my journey. I've drunk more than I've should have. I've stayed indoors and not picked up the hobbies I had in mind. I'm still developing and I've still got a lot of progress I need to make. I need to move out and find myself an apartment. I need to eat more healthy and generally be more productive. And I need to take dating more serious, and put in an honest effort in getting a girlfriend. A lot of goals that I promise myself to be more mindful about, when I'm racing through year two. 

I didn't cave. Even though I've been offered it plenty of times. Even though I've been in environments where you are looked differently if you pass the blunt without hitting it. I've changed - and I couldn't be more proud of that accomplishment. In that note - thank you for being there as a constant reminder of the journey we are on, together. For being a rational strain of thought, when the days were tough. 

I'm not even remotely done yet. I'm optimistic and hopeful about another kick-ass year of my life.   


Thanks.

Time in which I sit, think and realise how much time I’ve squandered. 

For me it’s a cycle - at first I’m fully in my cravings and withdrawal, then I’m energetic and optimistic and feel much better, and then that wears off eventually and I’m left with the ‘happily ever after’ of realising that for the rest of my life I’m not going to be getting high (something I loved) and also coming to terms with the damage I’ve already done to my life. 

I’ve smoked daily for about 6 years, and more sporadically but still heavily for a few years before that. I know my life would be in a different place now if I hadn’t done that. I also know I had an incredibly difficult adolescence and early adulthood and so I had reasons for wanting to run away and hide myself from what I was feeling. I know I need to not judge myself, I can’t change the past and things happened for a reason, but it makes me sad to think of how much time I’ve lost just because I was scared. 

How do we forgive ourselves? How can we use this to propel ourselves forward rather than be paralysed by judgment, shame and fear for the future?

I've been pretty much high for the past 2 years.  38 year old male.  In the past it hasn't been difficult to just stop smoking weed, at least temporarily, to take breaks.  But based on certain difficult events in my life, and my own bad habits, I've been caught up in a whirlwind of constant usage that's gone unbroken for ages.  Now this is very much routine, muscle memory - I will have to relearn what to do with myself.

If I can actually work up the willpower to stop... my main concern is dealing with the withdrawal symptoms in the following days, weeks, months.  It's going to take a longass time for my body to deal with this.  I'm smoking something like .75-1.50 grams a day.  Currently on Gelato.  I mean, it's a lot.

&#x200B;

So, withdrawal.

I have problems in my life with rage and depression - my energy doesn't go into the right places, I'd venture - so I'm really worried about having very serious mood swings.  Happened in the past.  The depression is one thing, but the rage concerns me more... it's so awful, and I've stressed myself to very unhealthy degrees.  I desperately want to stop this destructive behavior - and this, honestly, is one of the reasons I smoke so much weed...

I suppose the problem is... I don't know how to wean myself off this.  And I very much want to be GENTLE with this process.  I've been so wrought and stressed in the past two years that I effectively have PTSD... so I want to be **as gentle as possible with this process**.  On my body.  

And I'm afraid of becoming crazily volatile, and stressing out to unhealthy degrees.  **How to wean?**  If it's around I tend to just use it...

I was using weed to escape from confrontation (in this case an argument with my partner) so I decided to go for a drive instead and remind myself of why I decided to quit.

Recently been having some financial issues leaving me weedless for up to 2 weeks. So it's like I'm involuntarily quitting when I don't really want to. Which is what lead me to this sub. 

Deep down obviously yes I want to quit. A bigger part of me though wishes for legalisation as in my opinion its the cost of it that's, not ruining my life, but prevents it developing due to a lack of money.

I feel uncomfortable writing this because Ive only seen people say the opposite on here but I like weed and I like how it affects me. I've suffered with depression from a very young age due to events. Weed was and still does help.

I just don't see how I could ever not need or want it. I was 4 hours late to work the other day because of insomnia.. 4!
I've made quite a name for myself within my company and it all hangs by a thread. In light of the insomnia how can I quit without losing my job?

And worse yet I don't see how I could ever quit without breaking up with gf of 3 years.. She smokes to and I cant be around someone who does if I'm trying to quit. Bye bye my social circle to.

The way I see it for me to quit costs nothing less then my job, friends and relationship.. Ironically I thought it was being on drugs that jeopardised those things.

Right now I haven't slept in 48hrs and I'm losing my god damn mind. 

I guess what I want to know is if there is anyone similar to me that managed to get to a point of genuinely never craving it again. If that's not possible I genuinely don't see the point as I can't simply deny the pros it has on my mental health. Weed helps my depression but I'm still me.

But for the first time not only am I dreaming very vividly, but it FELT like i got high from smoking a few bowls and eating “400mg” of edibles in my dream. I genuinely felt like I was high and I cheated myself, only to wake up and realize it was all a dream. It was extremely frustrating especially as someone who relied on smoking to avoid feeling/make myself feel something if that makes sense? Idk, being high makes things so much easier to handle or I guess not deal with the root of problems either.

As well, I went downtown for the first time since quitting and I didn’t realize how hard it was going to be to walk around so many other individuals participating in smoking. I can smell weed from a mile away and it’s like my “brain’s mouth watering” for it, I crave the psychological feeling of not feeling at all. I’m not going to lie, I still drink quite a bit, but it’s only social and I’m proud that I’ve cut down on several other bad habits (smoking, overeating, picking/biting my nails, and I’m currently trying to work on procrastination which is hard for me when sometimes i’m only in my head and I let my anxieties/fears from depression take over). 

I’m on antidepressants and I truly feel the happiest I’ve been in 2 years, but damn I really didn’t think of how much of a life long battle this is going to be. It truly sometimes feels like I’m trying to run up an avalanche, but I know it’ll be worth it in the end as I have opened my own shop to start creating fashion/art pieces as a way to express my feelings of happiness and confidence or heartache and pain. 

I hope everyone knows I truly believe in you all and I know we will all get better one day.

I’m a 41 year old male and I smoked for 26 years. I quit drinking 11 years ago as I also had an alcohol addiction. I thought for a very long time that I needed marijuana to cope with my anxiety and depression, though I finally realized that it was ultimately making these conditions worse. I’m currently 7 months weed free. Do I still miss smoking? Yes, sometimes. But the cravings are getting fewer and further between. It’s amazing how much clearer my mind is. I didn’t even realize the fog I’d been living in. I don’t want to go back. My kids have a completely sober and present dad now, something I didn’t have as a kid. My wife has a completely sober and present husband. She’s proud of me. I’m proud of myself for the first time in a very long time. I feel light and free and genuinely happy and content for once.

 I started smoking when I was 15 but decided then weed wasn’t for me due to it making me feel like I would go crazy for a good 2 hours i then picked it up again in uni I was hanging with smokers so felt obligated to try it again and it was different, really good and from then I was doing it everyday at night I didn’t like to be high during the day as I felt it made me really unproductive. 

my mother then fell ill with cancer and I started abusing weed to numb how I felt about it I stopped going into uni started selling drugs as I thought it would be a way out which it wasn’t I failed my first year and was given the opportunity to retake that summer, I didn’t smoke weed at home but when I was back in uni it started again I was smoking more now selling weed to fund my habit so I was running through a lot of weed to the point where I was always high I was so slow lost motivation for the gym studies it led to me fucking up in uni again to the point they wanted to kick me out. 

Fast forward a year now They let me stay and I realised that my addiction to weed has robbed me of soo much my love for boxing (I was an ameutar boxer before uni) I went to the gym all the time I was in great shape the money I spent on weed I could probably buy a Range Rover no kidding. 

Recently close friend passed away and we had a small argument before hand he was in hospital for a week before he passed and in that week he had attempted to reach out to me and I didn’t answer because I was high and couldn’t be bothered. 

When I found out he died I felt really guilty and started smoking again which made me feel worse when I woke up in the morning I couldn’t sleep that night and decided it would be okay to pop 5 codiene pills and when High of weed and pills nothing had changed I still felt shitty sorry for myself even. 

now I am on day 3 of my sobriety I really do miss weed but I know that for now it’s not for me I can’t sleep and I get night sweats and the cravings are horrible I try to subside it with cigarettes any advice and words of encouragement would be much appreciated",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7264629}"

But I realized yesterday I hadn't had a single genuinely sober day in more than half a decade, and THAT really blew me off my feet. 

I got into an awfully abusive relationship when I was 23, it took a while to manifest but it was, absolute hell, I started drinking heavily and abusing opiates to cope, pretty soon I was drinking daily and totally hooked on opiates. That went on for years, and finally it ended, but I was a wreck. Had to move house a few times, coping with PTSD, briefly homeless, got sick and needed emergency surgery, lost my job... Been through the fucking wringer man. I got into a Suboxone program and spent 3yrs on it, I picked up smoking weed daily around the same time I started subs, opiates use decreased and weed increased. In October I finally came off subs, with heavy heavy weed use (permastoned basically) and the help of benzos. Then as my life started getting better being clean from opiates, my weed use started to naturally decline. Daily still, but not as often, no wake n bake, packing my bowls more loosely, etc.

 I noticed I was so emotional, I had blinding headaches, bouts of rage, weeping fits, couldn't sleep, sweats and shakes, nausea and diarrhea, no appetite, etc. Always around the same time every day. I started freaking out thinking I was feeling the onset of opiate withdrawal, wracking my brain trying to figure out if I could've been accidentally ingesting opiates, or if my weed was laced somehow - It only went away when I smoked weed after all, and seemed to correlate to when I hadn't smoked for a while with my decreased usage. I didn't even know weed withdrawals were a thing that could happen, I thought it was more likely I had been secretly somehow using opiates again without knowing it and only weed took it away rather than think it was just the weed itself. Lmao. That's how bloody pervasive the 'you can't get addicted to weed!' stuff is. As soon as I put 2 & 2 together I was like nah son, screw that, I'm not gonna be addicted to anything, let alone WEED! So I packed one last tiny bowl, went to my psychiatrist appointment, and filled my scripts for clonazepam and baclofen.   


Couldn't handle the insomnia and emotional craziness, panic attacks, cramps and shakes etc, so I used the baclofen and benzos to cope with the cannabis withdrawals, occasionally even some booze (though it didn't really help, just made me feel gross on top). I've been keeping a journal all this year, noting what I take and when just to keep track of my days y'know. Yesterday I got up, had a shower, got dressed, went out to a cafe', wandered around town, came home and worked out, listened to music while reading, did some gardening, then went to fill my day in my journal. Noticed that I didn't have to write down any drug at all. No weed, no benzos, no opiates, no opiates, no baclofen. Looked back through the last months and realized what that actually meant... When was the last time I had gone a whole day, just a single day, with no mind altering substance? Sure I've got 5 months off opiates, but weed... Sure I've got nearly 2 weeks off weed, but benzos booze and baclofen... Well holy goddamn shit, it can't have been since... Since I was at least 24?? Is that right?? Can't be! Jesus take the wheel are you kidding me!? How the crap did that even happen. Wow. 

But I'm actually free now, I don't even remember what that felt like. This is huge. It's still rocky, I don't feel 100%, probably not even 60%, but still a thousand times better. Knowing that I can actually make it a whole day (nearly 2 now) without needing or even thinking about a single substance just to get me through, after that long, after all that, and to be fine... Well, I can't even describe. I would've said I was clean already, but I suppose I would've been wrong. And actually I'm pretty happy to have proven myself wrong this time. Gonna keep on keeping on, let's see what life is all about again. Feel like a brand new man.

My PCP ran and EKG. Heart looked great. And ran blood work. Everything is great.

But despite all this, and despite the fact I know everything was vastly better not high all the time, I'm just... not feeling like I have a reason to quit. I know that sounds stupid. But what I mean is, I can write down on paper a hundred reasons to quit, but when it comes to actually stopping... them reasons just feel kinda like lies?

Like when I'm high I will just curl up in my room, eat myself to sleep, not speak to anyone (even my own housemates) and generally just waste away. I get nothing done, I am lazy and feel worthless about it. But then... when I'm not high, my brain is actively telling me that none of that is true, I can function just fine with weed, that I do actually enjoy being high, etc, etc. Is this wrong or is this some sort of trick my brain is playing on me? I really want to be weed-free, but the desire to smoke is just too strong... I listen to a song when they mention weed and instantly get jealous about the fact that they get high all day long and I'm sat here not even able to have one joint.

I threw 20+ joints in the trash this morning. Here we go again...,"My one year anniversary of moving to Vietnam kicked things off. I turned my life around here, which before I left, was at a dead end that had me drafting suicide notes just to see what it would feel like. I was pretty close. My plan worked (teach English) and I'm so, so grateful. But after a year here I faced a mental crisis of sorts. Obsessing over the following:

&#x200B;

""When am I going to go back to the US? Is that even home anymore? How can I tolerate the shitty quality of life I'll have as a low-level office worker? How could I possibly leave my friends here? I'm so lonely... but should I stop dating people because I don't know where I will be in 5 years? Will my parents stay healthy until I'm back? How can I build a non-teaching career here that could be transferred back to the US? My resume is a fucking joke.""

&#x200B;

I eventually got over that and made a few long-term plans. But it was too late, I was back to 24/7 smoking from the stress. Wasting money, eating shit food late at night, being stoned at inappropriate times, etc. Why not quit after I figured my shit out? Well, because once a pothead, always a pothead. Oh yeah, and someone fucked me over by promising me a job that didn't exist. So I resigned from my shitty job and was then told ""oops sorry... position is open in the summer..."" which obviously was extremely stressful for the 2 months it took for that to play out. Should be ok though, public schools are always in need of teachers, I'll do that after tet vacation (chinese new year).

So now it's February and schools are fucking closed. Closed all month. I couldn't get a job. Nothing to do for an entire month but game and smoke weed.

The high isn't great especially when you build up a tolerance. But... you can be smoking all day and only spend a few bucks. Though it has become pointless, I barely get high anymore. I also cough a lot when I smoke here, probably due to the pollution + unregulated pesticides on the shitty outdoor.

I've been lurking for so long, I can't even tell anymore.
Decided to share my story and thank all of you for supporting me without even knowing.

I (M28) started smoking weed at 13 yo and have been smoking (with several short pauses) pretty much all my life until last january. There were times I smoked less (several times a week to 0.5 gram daily) and times I smoked heavily (2-3 grams a day) but for most of the time I was smoking on a daily basis. 

Weed never felt like it would destroy my life but rather always felt like a good old friend I could always rely on. That is, what I consider it's greatest danger. The sublety of weed, making so many things so much more difficult.

Despite being diagnosed as a highly gifted kid at a young age and skipping first grade because I was able to read, write and do most of elementary school level maths in kindergarten.
 I often struggled in school, not because I couldn't follow the lessons but because I was often high in school or skipping school because of being high. In the end I still graduated my country's equivalent of high school, but had very bad grades and at some point almost got kicked out for being absent.

At 18 I moved out of my parents house and started going to university about 500km away. Living in a student dormitory I quickly started to bond with pretty much every other pothead and weed became an even bigger part of my life. 

When I went to the university it was almost exclusively for the few mandatory courses, exams or at a later point to work as a tutor. For the most part, I was just in that city to party and do drugs.
 I studied for 6 years and didn't even get my bachelors degree, even though I even wrote a bachelor thesis.
As a result of years of taking nothing serious, I got kicked out for screwing up my last try for an exam from the 2nd semester. 

In 2012 I lost my driving license due to driving while high and I never bothered to do a 1 year drugscreening with a psychological assessment of my driving capabilities until last year.

After university I got a place in a 3 year apprenticeship with very low pay. My boss knew why I wasn't allowed to drive and he tolerated it for the course of the apprenticeship (since the process of getting back my license costs a shitton of money I didn't have) but after that included me being able to drive as a necessity for the following employment contract.

This was, what finally gave me the incentive to get my shit together. I quit smoking cold turkey, did the drug screening, got my driving license and a car, got a job with a decent starting salary and am looking forward to moving into a house with my girlfriend of 6 years (living together for 3,5 years in a small appartment).

For the first time in my life I feel like a worthy adult and not as a teenaged fuck-up. I could have had all that happiness and security so much earlier if I wasn't stoned all the time. 

During all that process I often read the posts in /leaves to remind me what it felt like, when i relapsed the first couple times and had to start again. Your encouragement of every single one of us struggling might not have been the reason I didn't relapse but it was the reason it was easier to stay strong. Thank you.

Sorry for the huge wall of text but I got carried away.

At 22 I can see I have most of my 22 ahead of me and I know smoking/dabbing won't help me.

It takes up so much of my time, my money, and my lung capacity. It's hard admitting to myself that most of my friendships revolve around getting baked. I love my friends and have known many of them for over a decade, but just feel stagnant with my life. After lots of denial, I have concluded that my daily smoking habit has stunted me. While I have casually dated, I have never had a long time relationship/girlfriend. It is probably my biggest insecurity being a 25 year old man. I've been going through a lengthy dryspell (over a year), and I blame much of it on not putting myself out there. As in, I get off work and then go home and get stoned immediately, or at a friends place. This sounds so pathetic but its become an ingrained habit. Weed is something I used to enjoy spontaneously and socially in college but it has since turned me into an antisocial shut-in.

 I have noticed my social anxiety has increased as I've grown into my mid 20s. I used to not be like this. I wouldn't say going over to the same four friends' houses to rip the bong has helped me much with expanding my social circle . It's difficult admitting that I need to make new friends who's free time doesnt just revolve around getting baked all the time. Anyone here share these feelings? Wanting to keep long time friends but also acknowledging they are making me complacent with mediocrity. I dont want to sever friendships but I'm eager to change. I'm glad I discovered this page. While I dont plan on never smoking again, I do plan to quit my daily habit. I havent smoked for 5 days and am feeling some mental clarity and less anxiety in public places. I hope you may be able to relate with me. I want to abstain for a full month and perhaps beyond. Thanks to everyone on this page, you're posts have strongly motivated me to analyze myself and my future, without a chronic daily weed addiction!",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4152654}"

Last time I left, I had a support group around me. Today, that help is no longer here. I turned 35 this year and have to reset my life. I need to take control for myself; something I never really have done. My life has to change though. 
It starts now. Im done with marijuana and thc. The journey together has come to a crashing bitter end. Taking me so many years and attempts to understand that it never helped me when I was in need - yet it masked its glory which made me okay with mediocrity and not accepting my emotions/faults. I truly believe I halted my development over the last 15 years.

This has to happen now, since November I’ve been in a spiral of depression, anxiety, heartbreak and despair. I needed to go through some certain stuff to understand myself better. I’m at a good point now to make the biggest step; sobriety. Even though I’m pulling myself through the depression, I know the best thing I can do for myself right now is - to be done with weed. It’s all been tossed out of my apartment now, in the dumpster to be fair.

I need to stop. Get sober because;

- I want to do something for myself out of love 
- I want to be a better dad for my daughter; to be sober doing things with her. She’s 9 and over the years there’s so much I don’t remember because I was baked all the time 😔 
- I want to give myself the best chance to overcome this depression and anxiety 
- To make me more employable; I need to find work and I don’t want any limitations on where I can. Plus I’ll be more mindful and present which will allow for me to actually progress in a job. 
- To accept, learn, understand human emotions. I’ve been in some incredible relationships with amazing people in the past; only to fuck it up because I relied on my vices to bury my emotions. I do want to find love again one day, but self love first and foremost.

One day at a time. I will honestly put my best effort in everyday to focus on the better life. I am asking for your support here r/leaves; as I currently do not have a circle to lean into. I will do my part to contribute to the community here a couple time’s a week; as sharing our stories of our struggles and successes can only benefit us all 😊

It feels right to let weed go. I know as a daily smoker for 15 years, that just stopping will be a shit show for my body but I have accepted it and need to go through this journey. 
Thank you to this community for the strong folks here that contribute. You all give hope ❤️",12,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44122016}"

I have cut my consumption down about 5 days ago due to leaving for vacation. I won't lie to you. This addiction to weed, is the most severe addiction to a drug I currently have, and I have tried every drug under the sun minus PCP & Research Chemicals.

I don't know how I can live a normal life if I have never lived a normal life. I started smoking at 12 years old. Never stopped. I have been feeling major depression and haven't been able to hold down a job or concentration. 

I don't know what it is like to be a sober adult, because I have never been sober as a teenager nor as a young adult. 

I feel so conflicted about my MJ use. It makes me so happy, calm, helps with my drug addiction recovery (opiates, cocaine), helps me sleep etc... I have only started to realize the negative effects recently as this drug has taken over my life and I spend so much money and time mentally masturbating to drugs. 

I have associated marijuana use and the feeling of being high with a baseline level of being. So now that I'm not stoned for the last four days I feel super irritable, very depressed, waking up at 3PM, tossing and turning in bed until 6AM.

I am so confused about my usage. This drug has lifted me out of the darkest corners of my life while being abused my dad and during my parents divorce and throughout my Mom's struggles. 

Without using it I am unable to be as compassionate although I am still nice... I am not as nice. I feel cranky all the time. Not hungry. Forcing myself to do anything and everything. Less writing in my journal which I never have an issue with.

Here goes...

First of all, well done. Well done for coming here and trying to help yourself. Well done for realising you have a problem and having the guts to do something about it. A lot of people stick their heads in the sand and pretend it's okay, but YOU reader, clearly haven't. Kudos to that. And, I'm proud of you right now even if you aren't.

First few days are an assault on the mind and the body. Big time. But it shall pass. And once the first hump is over with it gets easier in many senses.

Actual tip time:

Caffeine: this stuff is bad when you're quitting (well, all the time really if abused and us chemical abusers tend to overindulge...) So, if you currently abuse it to counteract the effects of weed as a normal part of your day, start tapering down. Don't cold turkey caffeine it's horrible. Try to limit the use to early in the day if you use it. That includes tea, and sodas with it in. Doing this will help ease anxiety and help you sleep.

Exercise: Mega good. Just do it. Not only will it tire you (help you sleep) but it'll release endorphines and help stress relieve. It'll also keep you busy and will help literally sweat the weed out. Saunas and steam rooms are also good for this. Even going for a walk is good. Get out of the house if you can, you are no longer a prisoner or a slave to your drug or thoughts so get back into the world again, you've been missed!

Hydration: Key. Keep fluids going and try to flush the weed out. I'm not saying drown yourself with water but you may get bad headaches if you're missing this step and it's an easy thing to miss.

Eating: A toughie. This can be a battle. I suffered with nausea and had no appetite for days. So I drank protein shakes and water for the first few days. Your appetite may disappear for a while but it will return. Nausea can be counteracted with ginger tea and ginger ale apparently. Give it a try if you're struggling.

Yoga / meditation / prayers / mindfulness. Can be very useful. Give em a try. Relaxes me a lot and helps me shut off the noise and grounds me. You may have a lot of internal battles coming up so learning how to overrule urges and bad thoughts should be a priority. Learn how to say ""no"" to any voice or notion that suggests weed is a good idea and one more won't hurt. It'll also help if you can find some positivity from somewhere, as you get free you'll feel it building inside you so listen to THAT voice and build on every bit of progress you make. It all adds up. 

Reading. In the first few days being alone with my thoughts was terrifying. So I took my mind elsewhere til I felt normal again. So read. Read anything, it doesn't matter much what it is although if you choose something you're interested in or related to quitting, even better. After a while I could enjoy movies etc again but for the first few days that wasn't happening.

Sleep hygiene. Super important. Day 1 literally strip your bed and wash the bedding and for the first night you'll have nice clean bedding which should help you enjoy your bed again (especially if it reeked of weed) Then set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. That means no phones, TV or devices that can distract you for at least an hour before your set bedtime. Nail this and the insomnia won't be as bad. And the sooner you can sleep properly the easier the battle is.

Communication and support. Find support (here is a great place) and talk whatever shit you're going through out. Sometimes you'll just want to rage but you'll feel better after it. Read some of my old posts if you want a laugh, I said some right crap initially 😂😂 family friends and even people online can be a massive help in stopping you feeling alone. You are not alone and others will understand. Not everyone will fully understand of course, but people here will certainly have been through similar so don't struggle on alone. Get to meetings or therapy if you can. The more weapons you can add to your arsenal the easier the battle will be.

Journalling / lists / accountability. I downloaded the Grounded app and in the first few days checked in every few hours. Every time I felt shit. I also used the check ins to write my thoughts down to get them out. Not everything I went through and thought about was I willing to share with others. I still use the app to check in now although I do forget. Being able to literally scroll through my thoughts and see that little acorn growing has been super useful. (Seriously download the app it's free 😆) it also tallies how much money you've saved and how far into each withdrawal you are so you can see ""Oh I'm 3 days away from not being angry anymore"" 😂 😂 but I also wrote a lot of things down by hand. The first few nights I needed to keep my hands busy so I just got some paper and went with it. I'm now trying to improve my handwriting in the evening and I'm getting there! It'll also help keep you accountable too. You won't want to lose your trophies you get for each day achieved either. Finding people to keep you accountable can help a lot too.

The lists side of things... I wrote reasons why I should stop eg it makes you selfish, it makes you dumb, it makes you apathetic. And then if I got the urge I looked at that list and remembered why I was doing this. I also  found a picture of some family and put as my phone background, to remember who I'm doing this for. That helped a lot in the early days. Now it's just a picture of the outdoors, something which I now enjoy again as a former addict now I'm free. 

Love, compassion and forgiveness. This is for you. Give yourself these 3 things. You deserve them. You've probably fucked a few things up in your life but it's not worth suffering forever for. We're all human. We all make mistakes. And the sooner you can give yourself compassion, the sooner you can forgive yourself. The sooner you forgive yourself the sooner you can love yourself again. And people who love themselves? Have the happiest lives and don't self harm with drugs....

The anxiety, loneliness and sadness will pass.

Hope that helps anyone who needs some guidance. And, as always, good luck and stay strong ❤️💪🏻❤️

So it’s been 7 days since I last smoked and pretty much everything in my life is getting better, and much quicker than I thought. I’ve used my sober evenings effectively and now have a spotless house, even all of the little bits I ignored when I was high like organising my kitchen cupboards and deep cleaning the shower! I’ve found that if I stop getting shit done, I start to think about smoking so I’ve been doubling down on being productive to keep weed at the back of my mind. 

The thought is still popping up quite a bit, but already really easy to control, I even went and had a cup of tea and a catch up with my dealer this evening to pick a bud up for a friends birthday gift and despite knowing it’s sat in a cupboard downstairs I know I have the strength to leave it there until I give it to him. 

Getting to sleep has been a pain, but it always was before I smoked anyway so the 13 years of nightly smoking I’ve done has just delayed me finding a less harmful way of overcoming that. That being said, even with several hours less sleep I’m waking up feeling more refreshed and finding I have heaps more energy throughout the day. I work in sales so have to be proactive to make money and have had the best few days at work, I’m keen to see how my figures change over the next few months as even with the constant haze on my mind I’ve somehow managed to build a very successful career which can only get better now I’m sober.

I’ve completely turned my diet around, in that I’m actually sticking to the healthy choices I tell myself I’m going to do, instead of forgetting about the salad I made for lunch and getting a takeaway with people at work as well as the fact I’m no longer smashing a loads of chocolate and shite due to the munchies every night. Not going to weigh myself for a few weeks but I’m pretty sure I’ll actually be able to lose some weight now rather than slowly piling it on as I’ve been steadily doing for years despite trying to be healthy. 

I’m really surprised at how quickly all this has changed, however I’m not resting on my laurels yet and know from reading all of your experiences that there will be plenty of times that test me in the future. It’s my friends 30th tomorrow and I know there will be plenty of people burning up there, I’m planning on asking people just to not offer me any and I’m going to spend half an hour before heading over thinking about and focusing on how great I’ve felt this week and how shitty I’ll feel to piss it all up the wall by smoking. 

If you’re thinking of quitting and can’t get the motivation to start, try and take on the experiences of everyone else in this group and see for yourself how quickly you can turn your life around. Yes it’s going to be hard, particularly the first night but you’re stronger than you think and you will overcome that nagging feeling. I’m yet to see that feeling disappear completely but as each day goes my ability to ignore it is improving.

Anyone living proof of life after 6 months sobriety and any testimony on hindrance of relapse in middle of sobriety.

Basically asking if relapsing throws away my 3 months and do I have to start it as if day 1 all over or can I carry on like I never relapsed... kinda feels like I'm asking if it's ok it's more me asking is it scientifically gonna setback or destroy intention.

If you’re just starting out, my best advice I’ve ever received and ever given is you need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable for a while. I know you want to crawl out of your skin to escape how you feel in this moment. But don’t, stay uncomfortable. You will adjust, I repeat, you will adjust. 

In the last 4 months, I’ve excelled at work. I’ve passed 2 classes in my college coursework. #3 will be done this month. I’ve faced some social anxiety in the face. It was hard but I made it through and didn’t die or smoke. So it was successful. 

The clear headed feeling is incredible. Once the fog lifts, all is clear again and it feels so good.

But honestly this group is and has been my best asset. I am forever grateful for the over 100,000 people giving support. I would not be here without you.

Turns out that was all bullshit. Since I no longer smoke I no longer have to sit in the living room. I NEVER HAD TO DO ANY OF IT, I just never realized that until I was sober. 
Now I go do what I want in my bedroom or a lot of times I just leave the house, just to do it, because it seems better than sitting there.

I had smoked daily for over 10 years and didn't realize the difficulty I would be facing immediately after quitting. I sank into alcoholism almost immediately. I was in search of a vice to replace the one I had given up. I drank literally every night and some days for 5 or so months. I finally quit drinking for good about 3 weeks ago.

Oddly enough, I have no urge to smoke and no urge to drink now at all. I was so scared of losing my ability to sleep well and be inebriated every night that I pushed myself way too close to the edge. I'm still having a rough time getting to sleep these past few weeks, but it's shocking to me how simple and easy it is to be completely substance free. I finally feel free of my chains, the need to get fucked up every night is gone and nothing has felt this liberating in years. I could go on further, but it won't amount to much other than me being proud of myself.

I guess the entire point of this post is to put myself out there and say that I know some of you might turn to alcohol as well when you quit, and I'm here to tell you that once you get started down that path it is a hard one to escape from.

There was no way I could feel this way all the time and be the person I wanted to be. It was a nice break but I knew this wasn’t the start of my habit again. 

I came back home and brought some edibles. I said I’d try holding on to them and if it got out of control I’d throw them away. Day 1 with edibles was out of control so I had to throw them out. 

However following the trip I finally felt normal again. The first couple days I didn’t feel as sharp. My appetite and sleeping felt questionable as I readjusted. However, the dopamine boost felt like it pulled me out of my depression. I finally feel good again. It’s a about 2wks later and I feel better than I felt in a long time. I don’t regret smoking one bit. 

It’s still crossing my mind. This slight urge. But I feel like I have it under control. I feel like I can keep on fighting the sober fight.",3,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4565934}"

This is my first time posting in this sub so bare with me, I hope this is the right sub. I wanted to gather people's experiences with heavily consuming then quitting cannabis. Since January '19 I started smoking more, maybe once or twice a day (no more than a hit or two each time), and this past August or so I started smoking much much more. It came to be a nearly 24/7 thing: wake&bake then keep puffing throughout the day, etc. After awhile I started feeling super sluggish, forgetting what day it was, and feeling apathetic/jaded etc. I stopped enjoying the things I loved doing like playing guitar or getting into a good video game. This along with the crazy-fast passing of time has really been a drag, I feel I could've gotten more done in this past year. On top of all that, I've been experiencing a sort've dull ache in my back and liver area since I started consuming more in August (research brought me to believe that the excessive THC can raise blood sugar) and I have a theory that it's put me in a pre-diabetic state. (Obviously sugar plays a part too, but I don't think the timing is a coincidence) I'm going to get this checked out of course. Quitting has been rather difficult due to the withdrawals. I feel sluggish and extremely depressed without it. I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has had these experiences/get advice for getting through the withdrawal symptoms. 

Thank you.

I know they are going to drug test me and I know that as a sworn cop, I can no longer partake.

It's tough that I have to give up this habit but it is the only issue stopping me from being an officer. My income is not sustainable at the moment and I have to move out of my mom's place which requires a modest income.

If you are struggling to quit, thank yourself for taking a step and reading posts about people who are or were in the same position. You are brave. If you are on day 1, thank yourself for making the decision to put the joint down. You are strong. If it is day 100, thank yourself for keeping your word. You are a fighter.

I thank myself for keeping my word this past weekend and not smoking at an outing with my friends. We were together for a 3 day getaway, and they smoked the whole time. I said no each time the joint was passed to me. I knew that if I had taken just one hit I would immensely regret it and be depressed the rest of the trip. So, self, thank you for that.

Today is Day 6. I am feeling a wave of low energy. Like my body feel like it needs a reset. It needs to charge. It needs a pick me up. It wants to smoke. I am having an easier time ignoring the feeling and just charging through my to do list. but i cant help but feel that before a long day ahead I feel like I want to smoke, and after the long day has ended I am wanting to smoke too. 

I dont even know if it is wanting to smoke. but what it feels like is ""damn you have been doing a lot the past few days, take a breather, relax, clear your head."" It's a nagging feeling that makes me feel like after I do just one thing, my life should be put on pause to zone out and forget how it feels to even exist. I dont know how to quite put it in to words. If i try, I say it feels like I need a ""pick me up.""

I feel like I need a break. But the thing is, a break from what? I haven't done anything. 

Thats why I want to stay sober today. It is depressing knowing that I feel depressed cause I'm not smoking. But I do not want weed to be the only thing that is able to pick me up. I dont want weed to be my happy place. I dont want to depend on smoking to feel normal. And if I decide to smoke I am not giving myself the chance to be picked up by my girlfriends laugh, or my baby niece's smile. A phone call from my mom, or going to the gym. If I smoke those things become taken for granted, and weed is the only thing that makes me feel free.

I haven't been on Day 6 in a long while. I never been on Day 6 without a deadline (usually I just take a break from weed instead of quitting). So it is depressing because I dont know how long this is going to last. how long am I going to be searching for happiness elsewhere instead of seeing it right in front of me. How long am I gonna have to push through until I feel like I finally made it through. 

I dont know. but i do know that I cant back out of this journey. I dont know how any of the days to come will turn out. But I know that I whatever happens it is my responsibility to take it on if I truly desire to change. 

And i truly desire to change the fact that I feel like weed is the only thing that can make me feel better, which is why I am staying sober today.

No more sugar rush before bed which was unhealthy. I am usually content with my dinner and rarely eat a snack an hour or 2 before bed.

We are so clouded by the weed that we think it tastes better but I tell you, you will appreciate food even more. I am now craving to eat my homedish at work because of how tasty its gonna be.

Before I started smoking weed I always felt alone. I've always struggled with mental health issues and being super anxious and shy around people. Even though I always had people who were willing to be my friend I was unable to open up and connect with them on that deeper human level. Marijuana helped me become open to feeling my own pain. I was able to be alone with myself in a positive way. Before marijuana, being alone was hell, being around people was hell, every day was hell. Marijuana helped me feel like I always had a friend. It really did help me become comfortable in my own shoes. 

But what I always wanted was to be okay without having to rely on anything. In the last year or so I've really been working on developing that trust within myself and being able to depend on myself because my whole life I've let myself be swayed by the waves and the winds and denied myself the right to steer my own direction. I never felt worthy enough to honour my own wants and desires. 

I guess I used weed to help me get to this point, knowing that I have something to fall back on when it gets too rough, or something to celebrate with when things are great. And I'm really grateful ♡ it was an amazing 5 year journey. I've met so many amazing people that I wouldn't have otherwise. Also many not amazing people but that's life:P it also helped me see that the true heros are the people in my life that stuck around through the ups and downs.

My point is that I feel like Ive finally become the best friend to myself that weed used to be 😭 and I'm thinking of that 19 year old  version of myself who finally found some joy in life and just feeling so much acceptance and compassion for her ♡ ahhhh just feels so good to realize and accept the need that cannabis filled emotionally.

What is the discomfort you are feeling right now compared to that? Right now you are making your way towards freedom and a better life, to not be addicted, and to live as your true self.","This is just a temporary moment in time where you go through withdrawals and cravings. How often have you regretted a day of being sober? How often have you regretted smoking, when you actually didn't have to and you only realise it as soon as you are high again? Right now, all the discomfort you are experiencing come from weed, not your sobriety.

Once your body deals with the remnants of the plant, and once you let go of the bad habit you are clearly wanting to let go, you won't feel so uncomfortable. When you fight in your head about ""to smoke or not to smoke"" it is draining. Your body and mind may say that you would feel better right now, if you just smoked a little.

While that may be true, you would know it doesn't last forever. Sooner or later, you will be faced with this discomfort again, so why not now? Why wait and postpone your freedom? Why feel the same suffering over and over again, before you have the courage to stay still through the cravings? You have the power to quit at any time, you are stronger than your emotions. You have the power of your free will, and while the habits and addiction patterns in your brain tells you to smoke, you can just be. They won't make you do anything, it's only when you keep fighting them and you are tired from fighting that you give in, it's always your power, it always will be. Everytime you decide NO, that thought of wanting to smoke loses some of its power. After awhile, it doesn't take much to say no, because that pathway in your brain is dying out, slowly but surely.

You'll get dreams of smoking, glorified thoughts of good times when you smoke, and idealisation of being high when you quit, that is normal. Don't be scared of the thoughts. When you notice you tense up, you can for example just sit a few minutes and feel everything in your body. Follow your breath and notice you are fine. Even if you feel like shit at the moment, you are alive, there's nothing to worry about. It will get better, IT WILL GET BETTER. Don't lose sight of what you want, don't give into fear.

Keep going my fellow leaves. Even when it's hard, it just strengthens you. Be proud of yourself even when you get the smallest time off. Don't blame yourself when you are learning, everyday is a new opportunity to learn, you haven't thrown everything away when you relapsed after a streak. You can learn from your failures.

For me it is currently day 14, and while I still feel like I'm recovering, I don't feel nearly as bad as the first 1-10 days. I get thoughts of smoking, but I know it isn't worth it so I'll keep going and I keep telling myself I'm still recovering. Sleep is getting better and that feels good, still it isn't a reason to smoke the tiniest bit. I've already experienced being addicted, it isn't fun, and I'm tired of fooling myself and keeping myself from achieving things that I want because I'm afraid, and it's easier to fall back to the reason of being high, and post-poning things.

I wish all the best to you.

I’m not binge eating as much.

I also have been finding it easier to make the choice to drink water instead of juice. Basically, I’m becoming more conscious and in control of my decisions, more motivated to make healthy choices.

A message to all quitting or asking ""why quit?""","I quit 2 months ago and for the first month nothing really seemed to be improving, obviously withdrawals even made me feel worse, it felt like i lost a big part of my identity, but it was an identity i was always sort of ashamed of. For the last few weeks I've been seeing a huge drop in anxiety both general and social, its made me much more confidant and friendly, I'm not longer afraid to answer or make phone calls, ask a stranger there name, or try new things that make me nervous, and in doing those things mt confidance only gets stronger, so its not like quitting was a golden ticket,it just made putting in the work a lot more easy, I no longer spend as much time and energy thinking about about possible negative outcomes. I'm much less irritable now. Sleep is finally starting to get easier as well, not just compared to quitting, but compared to before I quit smoking. I no longer even think about smoking, even when i have nothing to do but sit in front of the t.v. things like music and food are just as enjoyable as when I smoked. Sure sitting down and smoking right now would feel crazy with my new tolerance, but I know myself and I know id be right back down the rabbit hole for potentially another 3 years and a one off good time is not at all worth the risk. I can now safely hang out around people while they smoke, but I do my dewdiligance and ask questions like ""do you smoke inside or outside?"" To avoid hot boxing myself back into the addiction, and ""please don't offer it to me, I'm very happy sober.

So please if you're having a hard time quitting, or taking that first night off, Itll take some time, but i guarantee you will feel one hell of a lot better once its out of your system, and I absolutely know that every one of you has it in you to make it through, and that you will all enjoy the bennefits of a weed free life. And remember, Not only does it take the THC up to about a month to leave your system, but it takes a month to form the pathways for a new habit in your brain.

My sense of communication is vastly different now, I was studying and needed to listen to an old presentation I made for school and listened to how I spoke when I was high and the stumbling, forgetfulness and general inability to communicate properly even though I had a paper in front of me was ridiculous. I would get locked up for seconds at a time trying to process the words in front of me and it was sad to listen to and the lower than expected grade I had for that class made so much more sense now. 

Not to mention with the clear head I have now being around people who smoke, I won't judge them by any means whatsoever, but I can't believe how some of the smartest people I know just come across so, so dumb when they're high...like they've resorted to an almost child-like demeanor and it's just weird. I'm also starting to understand why my non-smoker friends just sorta stepped away slowly from me, because when you're high all the time proper communication becomes impossible in it's own way and no-one, except the people you're getting high with, *get it in the same fashion you do because you're both down to the same mental capacity*, even if it's temporary. 

Just like Frank's Mom said on Blonde on Be Yourself, which I laughed at till I saw it for myself.

I've just hid from them in my bedroom with an xbox game and 3 bags of sweets ignoring my girlfriend's texts.,"A week ago I realised where my life was heading at the current rate: I'd either end up so self-loathing, depressed, and alone that I killed myself or I'd get bad enough that I'd quit weed for real and regret every minute that I wasted until I finally made that choice. 

I started smoking age 16 (19 now) and it quickly became my favourite thing to do. I used to have loads of hobbies: rowed really intensely training 10x a week, skateboarding, rock climbing, card magic etc. Very quickly all I wanted to do was get stoned and eat anything and everything. Ended up compromising my sport, lost all drive to succeed in my A levels. Used to smoke all day every day at home and then when the anxiety hit on going back to boarding school used to smoke out my dorm window and sneak off into a field for spliffs. Relations with my family that were already strained got completely cut off.

 The worse things got the more i just wanted to get high and forget about it, so I did. Fast forward a while and smoking 5 or 6 spliffs a day after work, unable to hold a conversation properly with even my mum. I've known I need to stop for 2ish years now and yet I couldn't, just seemed to end up smoking more. A couple times I 'got a sign from God that I needed to quit' and yet still couldn't stop for more than a day or 2 at a time. Also got involved in other drugs, just had such an addictive personality that I couldn't help but break my own rules that I'd set myself, e.g MDMA binge for 2 days. After that I knew I had a problem, told myself I'd cut down but it just came straight back up again. 

Anyway long story short I've been sober 7 days and I feel amazing but only in the knowledge that I'm doing the right thing. Every hour is tough and I so badly want to smoke, crazy mood swings and I cant sleep. I was caused to make this decision as my dysfunctional life is all coming to a head: depressed family, frustrated girlfriend, losing friends. All of this just made me want to get fucked and forget, just turn my brain off. No matter how much I smoked I couldn't get high enough, and I realised this was because the problems were never actually going away. 

I need to be there for the people around me, be stronger, and be a positive influence on the world. 2nd day I didn't smoke I cut all my long scraggy hair off, bought new shoes, clothes, actually dressed myself, ate well. I hadn't taken care of myself in so long but damn it's so much better this way.

I landed the dream job just before Christmas. I got to thinking that marijuana was less important to me than my job. And god forbid if I got hurt I could loose my career... So on December 31 right before midnight, I dabbed my last dab.

Fast forward 62 days later, I cut myself today pretty good at work through the safety cut gloves.

I was asked to take a UA Because of the injury, I was confident that I would pass because it has been 60+ days since I last smoked...I was very wrong.

I failed the test for marijuana and now I may lose my job. They are sending the results to a lab to test for the levels, based on that I may or may not lose my job.

It's very sad, depressing, upsetting, angering, that after so long I am still testing positive and I may loose my career.

I just wanted to get that off my chest. And to tell others if you haven't quit marijuana already. Quit before it's too late and you loose it all.

Stupid dabs aren't worth it. I do not regret quitting. I will never touch that posion again, but just know the decisions you make with dabs and marijuana will last for months and months!!",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7916405}"

From my experience in wanting to quit negative habits from my life such as nicotine, weed, and pmo (doing nofap) and have found personally that any time I’m unsuccessful in quitting, it’s always because of my mindset.

My successful runs have all been because I’m consciously aware of the damages the habits are causing me and it just clicks in my mind that this is not something I want to do.

There are varying levels I would suppose as we may all WANT to do it, until we believe we want to quit it down to our core and soul, we’ll fail.

I personally believe we all have our own timeline which once we reach that point in our lives where we whole heartedly no longer want to do something, it becomes much much easier to deal with withdrawals.

Each relapse is a lesson whether we’re aware of it or not as we learn our triggers and after taking however long a break we managed, it slowly becomes less appealing once we do relapse again.

I’ve also learned multiple ways to deal with urges, which my favourite (as neurology is cool to me) and that with each symptom or urge I get I just think of them as a starved receptor craving it’s partner and by not feeding it or giving in, it kills off that receptor and makes it easier.

Why? I still feel lazy and braindead the whole day after a night smoking. I finally feel a little sober around 6pm when we are eating dinner. I am running a business and this can't be combined together. I need more energy and motivation.

I'm a 45 year old long time heavy smoker who has pretty much been smoking daily for the past 25 years.    I always told myself that pot doesn't seem to affect me like other people  (the stereotypical stoner).  If I can smoke daily but graduate with a 4.0 and pass the CPA exam on the first try why quit?   I like it, it makes me mellow, and I seem to enjoy activities more.  Shoot I have been running my own small but successful business for almost 10 years.  Well here we are at 45 years old and for the past three years or so I have been wanting to quit bad but have struggled to even start. 

All my life I have dealt with anger/anxiety issues and pot seemed to help.    I did quit for a stretch when my son was 2.  During that time my anger/anxiety issues became out of control, at least in my opinion.  Went to a therapist, who I still see to this day, and she prescribed anxiety medication.  This helped but I still felt like I was an asshole to my family and would get angry over seemingly insignificant issues so I started smoking again.  I decided I would rather be a pot head then an asshole.   This is one of the main reasons I'm scared to quit.  

I'm now on two anti-anxiety meds and came to the realization that pot is not helping my anxiety anymore, not sure if it ever really did, but it actually seems to be making it worse.  I could ramble on for paragraphs on why I want to quit (family, money I have spent, health, etc) but one of the biggest issues for me is that it consumes so much of my life that I feel like a slave to it.   I just realized the other day that I don't remember the last time I was sober for even a day.  That just seems wrong to me.  I have been stoned at every major life event; the birth of my son, wedding, graduation, etc. and it makes me sad to think about that.  I want to quit so bad that lately I have thought of going to rehab.  Found this group during my search and after reading some posts I figured I would start here to see if talking with other people struggling will help.

This shit created a cycle. From occasional went to daily. In my head all was great and fun. But I realized how much I lost from this shit. All my family and friends know that I am a pothead. 
I was laughing at them and I didn’t really cared. 
People started to avoid me or gossip me (I really did some nasty things while I was high and I really hurt some very innocent people). This is no more fun. 
I started to train myself ( I lost a lot of my weight), I started to write code and I try my best every day. My conclusion is that you can find an immediate reward for everything (weed or any kind of drugs) or you can get to work for yourself and to try to improve myself.
I still keep thinking about weed, it’s still in my mind but it’s too hard to go back in that loop. Every day seemed to be exactly like the past day. I couldn’t stay a day sober because I would think about all day how good is the weed and how bad is my life.
What I learned is that before you quit something you need to do it for something. Go to gym, try to learn about something new or useful for you. Don’t quit and stay in bad whole day in that depression. 
It’s still hard, sometimes I cry in bad thinking about the shit I done for/while I was on this stuff. I hurt people. I can’t change the past but i can change the future. Now, I try to find good people to be friends with, I try to code every day, I try to read some pages every night. I have a poly-addict mentality and I know it very well, I could abuse anything that gives me pleasure but that’s how you get in the hole.
I started to relearn to enjoy life. I want a family someday, a kid, a good job, some real stuff, not those shitty dreams .
I don’t want to smoke ever again and I hope that my message helped someone.

I've been able to be more articulate with my words and construct proper and sound sentences without spazzing out in the middle and forgetting words.

My anxiety has completely disappeared, I've had pretty debilitating anxiety even when I was sober and not smoking, constantly worried what people thought about me and just having anxiety 24/7, now I have no problems being social, witty and not giving a shit what other's opinions are of me.

I saved money. So much money saved... I estimate about 5000 ILS (about 1.5k usd). Weed is expensive here in Israel and I've been able to buy so much new shit for myself...new motorbike gloves, new headphones, new computer accessories and I've been able to invest in the stock market too.

Not being dependant on a substance is a big plus, It feels so liberating not needing to toke up every couple hours to stray off cravings.

I've recently decided to try and quit smoking. I haven't decided yet whether I will ever go back to it as a casual thing like drinking but as of now I have gone cold Turkey
As I had become really lazy and have issues with anxiety, and memory. I think it also makes my BPD worse on the days it's out of control. 

I haven't had too many cravings, I definitely feel like it's the right decision for me. I spend way too much money on it and have more important things to focus on now (my own flat, university and wanting to get a pet). I was spending anywhere between 60 and 90 GBP a week. 

The only thing I'm really struggling with is the nightmares. I have them every night, they are so vivid and leave me feeling very tearful upon waking. I think they must  e exacerbated by my mental health issues because they all seem to be about me falling out with people in a really nasty, aggressive way. I have woke from one this morning where I had been attacked and verbally abused by a close group of friends who I have recently just had a night out catching up with. In the nightmare I even self harmed pretty severely which I used to do as a teenager and young adult but haven't in many years. I feel so distressed about this and as a result do not feel rested. I am lay here at the moment trying not to cry and to shake this feeling. 

Does anyone have any advice on coping or know how long this may last? As a teenager I had insomnia and I found after being prescribed a few different sleeping aids that cannabis was the only thing that helped me sleep. I worry that this issue may creep back in or I will be too afraid to sleep because of these incredibly vivid and disturbing dreams.

Its easy to forget how far I've come & what life was like in the MJ fog. Getting high for 40 years, heavily for past 10 after dispensaries began popping up in SoCal. I've been re-kindling my love of golf after dropping out of that scene a number of years ago because I was getting high too much to be any good. I've become somewhat obsessed with it, which may not be 100% healthy, but it helps keep me focused.

What I'm going through now is a feeling that I'm not much different now than I was 7 months ago so why not have a little toke and chill out. I know rationally this is not true - its my brain tricking me into using again because ""what difference will it make?"". My friend in AA explained to me that this thought pattern is the sickness that is addiction. He also shared that once you make THE decision \[to stop\] and NEVER use again - no matter what, it will be much easier to abstain.

If you're having a hard time know that the insomnia will subside and your dreams will calm down. I occasionally dream about MJ - that's a sign of recovery and a reminder to stay strong. Good luck to all.",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6073353}"

Thought I'd share my own story in hopes it helps others find the inspiration to quit.

&#x200B;

Like most, my usage started socially and I started a little later than some, just after high school.  
I spent a great amount of effort during my childhood to overcome my shyness and anxiety to the point I was outgoing and confident.

After smoking socially for a few weeks, I bought my own stash, I would smoke twice a week, but that slowly increased and suddenly it had been months of daily usage / 1-2 times a day. During that time I had started to isolate myself, I guess I felt shame and embarrassed if others knew I was smoking. As my house was the house to visit as I shared it with others, I started smoking in secret and locking myself away. This led to my housemates not including me in activities as they assumed I wasn't wanting to be part of it. I turned into a hermit, didn't contact my family.. I just worked a low wage job that paid enough for me to keep the habit up.

This then led to depression, I hated that I smoked and I hated that I hated it! So then I would smoke to not care anymore. This was where I spiralled. I attempted to quit over the course of years. One of the times I quit I used a relationship as my escape, I hadn't realised it at the time, but that relationship wasn't healthy and I had banked my life into it instead of weed. So when the inevitable happened and we broke up, I went straight back into smoking for a couple of years. I don't know where those years went and I felt hopeless, I had pushed all my close friends away and lived with someone who did copious amounts of drugs daily and one who was somehow unaware of all this happening in my life and just assumed I was hermiting it up.

After quiting, then going back through the bin multiple times (I remember desperate times of carving apples or carrots into pipes just to smoke and even stealing bud from the housemate who smoked all the time), I hated what I was at that point in my life and wanted to be more. I let my housemates know that I don't want to smoke anymore and I bought a CD to give to my friend, telling him to give it to me in 3 months as long as I hadn't smoked in that time. 

This gave me something to work towards, to aim for and TBH was the deciding factor for me to stay dedicated to the quit.

&#x200B;

It has been 2 years now since my last toke. It has been tough, I am still rekindling some old friendships, some I have lost forever. But I have been making new friends, started up old hobbies, been dedicated to the gym and developed my career out of a job I hated to one where I work within a Government organisation.

I have met the most amazing person in the world and she supports me and lets me be me and that is all I can ever ask for.

I have done more in the last 2 years than in the many years of smoking daily and I would never turn back! I do occasionally think about smoking, but it is not that pull that I had the first couple of months, more a side thought that my mind can think about and won't react upon. 

To all of you that want to quit, realising that you want to stop is your brain ingraining itself with a will to stop. You might fall back, you might struggle with hard times and feel the need to go back. But once you see the world and feel the world without the marijuana high, you will really appreciate how amazing life can be and how successful you can be in whatever you want to achieve.

I thought maybe a month would be good. I'm 26 days in now. 

Since the withdrawals ended (around day 18), I've felt fantastic pretty much every day. I actually didn't realise that I could feel this good, this consistently. 

After trawling r/leaves, I took the advice to start doing more exercise and building other hobbies. So I took up more serious swimming and piano playing. My diet is also better. I am constructing a different version of myself (identity). More pro-active. More dynamic.

For instance, I have chronic neck pain because I'm really tall, I sit at a desk a lot and I generally have terrible posture. Yesterday, I felt like smoking to numb the pain, then I realised, hey, I better fix my posture before I start getting long term damage. So I watched a couple of youtube videos, remembered advice that physios have given me over the years and I made a resolved decision to take simple and consistent steps so that I wouldn't be in pain my whole life.

Now I feel like I could go on and on, in the past two weeks, there have been about 5 similarly healthy and intelligent decisions like the posture intervention: in work, career planning and life admin.

It's funny that even now, after all of this, I still feel sad when I think about saying farewell to weed. So many good times. 

Then I think, isn't it suspicious that there is still this craving despite clearly realising that I feel so much better now.  Smells like addiction, even though I would never have called myself an addict.

Then I say ""fuck weed actually"" from keeping me from realising my potential. But this doesn't last long until I go back to feeling like I'm missing out on something.

It's at this point, when I begin to realise, that something I've always associated with lightness - the carefree weed high - what I used to think was the best way to live- contains also a heaviness. Even perhaps something to be afraid of.

I also found that the high was less intense than smoking but good enough to prevent the health issues of tobacco. On Thursday ( four days ago) I decided to kick the habit completely. My body felt it couldn't regulate my temperature and I would be sweating randomly in the day, even though it's bloody cold here! Then my appetite completely vanished, I would feel sick even looking at food. This went away after day three. I'm a healthy person I regularly go to the gym.

daily smoker for 12yrs or so.  been actively trying to quit for the last nearly 2yrs, but I’ve found journal entries from ages 23, 24 where even back then I knew I really wanted to quit. 

my dad died right before my 25th bday, we were incredibly close and in order to cope with his death I moved across the country and dove into an all-consuming career. I also moved to a legal state, where weed was readily available.

I’d like to acknowledge that pot really did serve a purpose. it helped me through an immensely tough time and I’m grateful for the safety blanket that it was for me.

however, I’m really at a place in my life where enough is enough.  I’m just overweight enough where it’s become uncomfortable and I don’t feel confident.  I actually love wellness & nutrition but it all goes out the window when I’m stoned. bottomless pit munchies, and I live alone with my dogs so there’s no one to even feel ashamed in front of. 

I want to feel vibrant and full of life again.  I’m so sick of making the same lists over and over of why I want/need to quit. broken record.  I have to do this for myself. I deserve to be healthy, happy and thriving - not constantly in an exhausted fog, scraping by, numbed out, binge eating.  

for my birthday I’m giving myself a new lease on life. it’s time. out with the old, in with the new. life is short and I can’t afford to waste more time.

So I go a few days here and there without smoking. I smoke maybe 3-4 times a week. These past few months I've been very tired throughout the day. I believe it is due to a poor sleep schedule, bad diet, and an energy drink problem but I can't ignore the fact that the weed contributes to it too. I'm working on fixing the other 3 things and feel that maybe if I quit smoking too I can really start to feel energetic again. But I'm having a hard time motivating myself, I'll get a nice long night of sleep, eat decently that day with no energy drinks, then my friend comes over and we smoke. It feels like a reward in a way. But I also understand that's a weak mindset and shouldn't be implemented on such a small scale (a day or two). I think the proper way is maybe if I did good this month I can smoke at the end, I'm just having a hard time finding that motivation especially since I only really smoke at night so other than the tiredness of the day after it doesn't really effect my life, it's not as if I feel the need to smoke before any particular occasion and I don't find myself thinking ""oh Im feeling ____ I  need to smoke"" as I hear some people say.

I'm 30 days alcohol-free and was planning to continue using marijuana, but the longer I've gone without alcohol and been reading *This Naked Mind* and the /r/stopdrinking forum, I'm realizing that I need to cut out the weed as well to truly dig into my issues and work past them. I mentally started rationalizing, ""who cares if I can't drink when I go to XYZ, I'll just get stoned instead"", which entirely defeats the purpose of enjoying life without blinders on. 

At my core, I am a people pleaser and co-dependent on my partner as a result of my low self-esteem and some unresolved trauma. For months now, I've been uncomfortable with how much I rely on weed, but I haven't wanted to push it because it's become such a big part of our daily routine that I was worried about upsetting the balance of our dynamic. I only smoke at night (with more on the weekends), but I'm not productive on it like he is. He can exercise and do his work while mildly stoned. I'm more of an all-or-nothing, so most nights ends with me being a zombie on the couch between 6-11pm until I go to bed. I did the math and realized I spend a third of my time awake stoned on the couch every day. GULP. 

As I've been working through my issues, I realized the weed is symbolic of my pattern of putting other people's happiness above my own needs, to my detriment. I don't smoke weed right now because I love it. I smoke because it's habit, because the thought of going a night without it makes me panic, because the thought of going a week without it makes me sad, and because I don't want to disappoint my boyfriend. While I'm an advocate for the medicinal properties of marijuana, this clearly is not what its intended for, so last night we had a long talk and I explained where I'm coming from. While he's not planning to stop his use, he fully supports my decision. Weed is no longer a choice for me, and I don't think it has been for a long time. I haven't been actively choosing to use weed. It's been choosing me. Through my cravings and my emotional dependency on it. I'm ready to take my life back and make choices for myself rather than letting an outside influence dictate my life decisions.

To all of you suffering right now don't worry about it, it really does get so much better in time.

Hang in there fellow Leavers. Once the initial withdrawals are over you will never look back. The future is bright if you are willing to put in the work to quit Weed. PAW's will rear it's ugly head from time to time but I find it comes around less often and is less intense as time goes by.

Hopefully this can be beneficial to someone else.



I love the symbolism of a chain, it perfectly encapsulates a duality of contrasting elements. Strong links that can, depending on ones personal outlook either be constricting and burdensome, or representative of strong, unbreakable links. And the paradox is that either scenario can be perceived as being the positive or the negative. 

The comparison between addiction and a ball and chain has surely been made countless times as, for one who had experienced it can tell you is an obvious one to make. It’s cumbersome, ceaseless, and takes a heavy physical burden on ones body to carry around all the time. It’s presence is always felt as it drags behind, an exhausting mass that pulls and follows like a heavy and relentless shadow, forever chasing and holding you back. 

Even if one can suppress and ignore its weight, the rattle and clanging of the chain serve as to remind you of it’s presence. Meditation can help dampen this noise, transmuting the cold, hard links of steel to rope; still it constricts yet its presence is far less aggressive and pervasive.  

The length of the chain represents the passage of time between ones last intoxication. As this time increase, so lengthens the chain. The links stretch farther apart, becoming more maleable, and can even allow the deepest rooted bonds to shatter completely. And the farther away you can pull yourself from the ball, the smaller it becomes to your perceptions; this once gigantic and engulfing force begins to appear more insignificant and weaker. 

i don’t believe that one cannot completely shed the ties once they have bound, nor should you attempt to completely banish its memory from your mind completely,  however one can certainly diminish the discord and pain it brings. Acceptance is key, to understand that you will always have these difficulties, and that one must be committed to total sobriety of your chosen recreational substance/substances. 

Pleasure and pain are the strongest forces in the formation and duration of memories. You’ll remember just as strongly and vividly the day you fell in love, as the day that same love was so cruelly stripped away from you. 

We perceive pleasure as a reward for our desires; Love is the reward of those bold and brave enough to open ones heart to others, and is the purest and most intoxicating of feelings. Or when exercising, the natural rush of endorphins serves as a communion between mind and body, a connection that you are here right now, alive and moving your body in servitude of yourself, overcoming and persevering. But when one learns to self induce these feelings via external chemical stimuli such as heroin or cocaine, this is where the danger lies. The biggest risk is when substitution of a negative emotion becomes the motivation for intoxication. Why work hard for the delayed gratification of overcoming negative feelings when a guaranteed source of bliss and contentment is so readily available in so many forms? 


Pain serves to remind and motivate us to not repeat the same mistakes. Externally this seems like an obvious and almost simplistic approach to dealing with our emotions, yet most of us will require the repetition of our mistakes for us to finally break the cycle.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.52314276}"

It was a habit that consumed me day in and day out. At the time, I was in a toxic, long term relationship with someone who was a huge influence in my life. When we transitioned to a long distance relationship, I made the decision to quit smoking to find happiness again.

The first few weeks (and months) we some of the hardest. Of all the reported withdrawal symptoms that people have experienced, I displayed each one. Nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, loss of sleep, weight loss (not good for me because I was already severely underweight), night sweats, MAJOR anxiety, and constant headache. But soon after I felt things were clearing up. I found the courage to break up with my boyfriend, I put all of my energy into school, I gained a few pounds and my relationships with family members began to improve after opening up about my struggles. 

I remember reading these one year posts when I was struggling at week one, and just having a million questions for them such as “how long until the anxiety goes away” or “when did you stop having cravings”.

But it all started as a way to dull the emotional pain of my parents divorce which was announced to me 3 days after moving away for university.  I had smoked pot maybe once or twice before and didn’t really like it. It made me incredibly sleepy.  But after the news, I just couldn’t deal with anything. I went into a deep depression and ended up withdrawing from 2 courses in my first semester. 
I was angry because I was trying to adjust to a new and exciting time in my life while trying to pretend that my family wasn’t completely breaking apart.  I didn’t want to feel anything, and pot made me numb to all those unpleasant feelings I was experiencing. I ate better, slept better and felt like I didn’t have to be “on” all the time.  But soon I started withdrawing from friends and doing certain things cause it was easier to sit in my room and burn and watch bad tv.  

Time has passed and I’ve since come to terms with my parents decision and we are all at a better place in our lives now. 

But the habit never went away and then I realized the other day it’s been almost a decade of me putting my body through that. I’ve been coughing up what I assume is resin or tar and that’s what scared the hell out of me. I have a 2 year old son now (I quit while pregnant and breastfeeding) and am turning 30 this year. I can’t be doing this to myself anymore. It’s just not healthy.  

The first few days were great, really motivating actually but now I’m feeling down and physically uncomfortable. It comes in waves. 

I want my old life back before I started this gross habit. I miss my old personality. I feel like a dull downed version of myself and I hate it.  I know there’s no going back. I can’t change what I’ve done in the past.

I don't know how many times I've tried quitting but I've been smoking cannabis since I was in about 15-16, just turned 29. There's been times in my life where I've abused it, other times where I've used it with some semblance of balance but regardless of how I've used it and how well balanced my approach was it would ultimately lead to total abuse. Smoking myself into a coma where I just lay around and give into other temptations.

I've had other addictions in my life some I've kicked and some I continue to battle with. What I know for sure is that one addictions enable other addictions, at least for me. Today was a struggle, I've had some serious brain fog, couldn't concentrate for longer then 5 minutes and felt absolutely exhausted.

I wanted to share my experience as I have found many on here have had similar experiences and I hope this can inspire the next.

My story:
I have been an every day, every morning, every night every inbetween smoker since I started college 13 years ago. I just turned 30 years old and have done a lot of reflecting on who I am and what I want for the future. I have owned multiple cannabis businesses including a glass blowing and hemp companies and have been pretty involved in the marijuana movement here on the east coast for the last few years. Since college I have had an abundance of marijuana always around me and the cost or accessibility of it has never been a problem for me. I guess you can say I’m a high functioning stoner while being able to run 2 business full time while staying active at the gym. I say this because I had thought If I can still run my businesses or do well in school or still go to the gym... then why quit? Maybe some of you feel the same?

That’s the thing. It’s not that myself or many of you reading this can’t function as a good human being while toking on some high grade ganja but then question to me is.. can I be better version of myself?

Yes I can do everything high but what have I missed out on if I wasn’t stoned all the time? For me personally is has been lost relationships and I now realize it covers up my depression and high anxiety I have been dealing with. I smoke just to be “weed happy” (I read this in another post that I liked). Just smoke to cover up when I’m depressed or for whatever sets off my anxiety or depression, I smoke to cover it up. I don’t want that anymore!

I have decided to break my habit and I started 4 days ago. I don’t want the feeling of needing to smoke before and after and during almost everything I do. I want to try out something I haven’t done in 13 years. I’m surrounded by friends and business that is all marijuana related so it will be very hard. That’s where my mind strong mentality comes into play. I want to look directly into the “dragon” and tell it to leave. It will be a mental fight everyday but i know my mind can do anything I set it to and so can yours as deep down we all have the control somewhere.

I inspire you reading this right now to be mind strong. To look and reflect on yourself and what you want for your future. Be honest with your self because you are most important. Face your fear and make a game plan to over come it. For me like many the gym and biking has helped a lot. I still haven’t figured out to do with all this none high time I have now but I’m slowly figuring out new ways to not be “weed happy” but just happy. 

I hope you can connect with this and inspire change. Message me if you would like to chat more since many of us are on the same boat.

It's been two years since I've started smoking, at the beginning the high was great, I felt happy, it made me more pro social everything was good, but as time went on things started to get worst, I started to feel depressed and negative about everything when stoned I had no motivation and ambitions were under the rock and most important I feel flat from a sentimental pov, it made me apathetic, I tried to lower the dose or to take long breaks but nothing seemed to work so eventually lowered the use of it and I pretty much stopped smoking.

I can't understand how a substance like weed  can change me so much to the point I can't feel love anymore, it hurt me so much that it made me even question what I feel for here and that maybe is not as real or deep as I thought if something  like weed can just delete it so easily.

I was never a couch lock, get rid of anxieties kind of smoker, on the contrary, it elevated my mood and gave me a spike of motivation to get shit done. Now that I’m clean-ish everyday is so bland and boring. There is little to none excitement in my life. 
Only positive side is no more brain fog in the morning but that only happened when I smoked at night anyway. 
Books are boring, cleaning is a chore.
Picked up smoking cigarettes again and long gone anger management issues came back. Yesterday I couldn’t even fall asleep because I was filled with inexplicable rage. 
Only way to get myself to do anything productive is to pump myself full of coffee which I haven’t drank before. Same with alcohol, I have a glass of wine every other evening now. Seems like a shitty trade of.

Maybe going cold turkey was a mistake?

When I am sad, I think weed would make me less sad.

But in reality, almost immediately after I smoked, I start being very confused. Very out of it and zoned out. I cannot focus on anything.

I cannot focus on any of my hobbies or things I would like to do after I smoked and as such I get frustrated with myself. Frustrated with my abilities which I start to doubt when high.

When trying to make music in FL Studio with my MIDI keyboard I find myself struggling to get inspiration and ideas. Hell, I even struggle with the basic interaction of the program because I get vey clumsy and my working memory gets too short to hold enough information to successfully do anything really

Same goes for my hobby of playing CounterStrike. In which you need to perform. Or rather, in which I would love to perform well because I am pretty competitive by nature.

Seeing how sluggish I get in my performance and how prone I am to make errors and bad decisions while high really hurts my self-esteem, making the whole high not an enlightening or positive experience, but much rather a negative and self-destructive experience.

Weed really doesn't add anything to my life but an easy escape that I love to use in times of difficulty.
It is not productive, not even neutral, but a very destructive way of using my time and my brain.

Usually I am a capable human being. Weed takes that away from me. Takes my dignity and self-worth.

And that is not only while being high, but also the days after where I feel less competent because of the foggy feel and increased anxiety that comes with the incapability to think straight.

When I quit, it was not because I felt like quitting, but because I think it broke my brain.  It’s been two months since I’ve quit, with the first two weeks leaving me a wreck, the next four weeks making me question my reality, and the last two weeks finally starting to feel a little better. When I quit, I had zero cravings for weed, and only cravings for normalcy and reality.  Now that I feel like I’m becoming more stable, the cravings are kicking back into full gear.  

That voice is back saying things like  “why can’t I smoke before making pancakes on a Sunday?” I know it’s terrible to even think about because I’m not even out of the woods yet mentally, nor near my goal of at least six months or more (I don’t think I’m actually a person who can moderate anyways) but now I’m seeing cravings in other ways, too, like beer or wine or even sex.

I’m not really sure what I’m saying other than acknowledging that the cravings are back and I am stronger than them, but damn it’s hard.  My brain is still rebalancing, my goals aren’t met, I’m still not 100% stable.  I guess I’m just acknowledging that reality is a tough pill to swallow, especially when more than half of life has been stimulated in some way by either on weed or adderal before that as a kid.",77,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6365904}"

I started a business and it's finally taking off because I'm actually putting effort into, rather than doing one hour of work, convincing myself I had made a great progress and I deserve to get high. There went the rest of my day.
Then last night something super awesome happened.
I met a girl. And not just any girl, she's amazing in just about every way, well to me anyway. Everything I'd have wanted. And it went great. I was able to talk, make jokes, laugh, not zone out, and she ended up being more than just interested in me too. We spent the whole night and most of today together, and moved our next plans up to Tuesday because it went so well. Its been so long since I've been excited by someone.
Success guys, success all round. High five.

I feel miserable, I have exams coming up and I am so filled with anxiety that I’m not studying. I have an important exam next week. I feel irritable, can’t sit in one spot, mind wonders off, I felt so euphoric this past week but the consequence of this euphoria is the onset of depression that I’m starting to experience. 

I live alone which doesn’t make it any easier to deal with this depression. I hang out on Facebook and join forum chats for some company. The insomnia has ruined my sleep cycle. I feel like my judgment is clouded of what is important and what isnt. 

Suicidal thoughts are starting to cross my mind (not suicidal and will NOT act on it). I think it’s because of all the stress plus lack of sleep that ending it seems appealing. 

My mind is weak right now: I do push-ups and tally it on my fridge everyday (at least 30 per day)  I call family and check in and the coronavirus news have kept me busy.

This is fucking killing me.," I have been smoking heavily since junior year of high school, and now I am a senior in college about to graduate after this semester. At first weed was a social thing for me, smoking with my friends, at parties, etc.. Eventually it become less of a social thing and more of a habit. My mind would think about that fat bong rip I’m gonna take when I get home, or thinking how bad I wanna get high while listening to a lecture. Just totally chained to the high and even the act of smoking. I am now quitting because this has gone on too long and I will not let this jeopardize my future with getting a job and what-not. That is not the only reason though, I want to be healthy and sharp again, I am tired of feeling sluggish and cloudy. I am tired of running home to hit my bong. I am tired of the temptations. I still have some weed and dabs that I was going to give to my friends for free but they’re like an hour away and I don’t know when they will come get it. I am thinking about just tossing it but I already told them it’s theirs, but the temptation can be so big sometimes I just hate having it here now. I just want this to be behind me. I’m not demonizing pot, I think it can be okay when used responsibly. Sorry for the rant but I really don’t have anyone to really talk to about this since most of my friends smoke. ",24,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7770658}"
