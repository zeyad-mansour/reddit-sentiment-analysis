I recently quit smoking tobacco and weed cold turkey, 2 weeks today.

I’ve quit smoking in the past but picked up the habit again until recently.

Every day since I have not slept for more than 3-4 hours a day. 

I am exhausted. I can barely breathe and the  anxiety is killing me. 

I’ve been going for 10 mile bike rides at stupid o clock to try and ease my breathing and restlessness. I’ve tried getting food/drink, watching a movie, probably 100 other things I cant remember. 

I’ve been going to work 8 hour shifts somehow and at this point I’d rather start smoking again than head in to work on Tuesday with no sleep over the weekend. 

Any ideas what I can do to knock myself out? Excluding any other drugs or alcohol?

1. I’m new here.
2. I’ve been a daily smoker for 5+ years. Up to about 2g a day since COVID. 
3. I live in Canada and choice bud is available everywhere. Several dispensaries in walking distance.
4. I’m convinced I have cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. I vomit every 2-3 mornings and have had a full workup from my GI (all clear) and OBGYN (clear).
5. I have psychiatric concerns which have warranted medication for 10+ years.

So, that said, I’m fucking depressed and unproductive and MISERABLE. Weed used to help with the mood disorders and anxiety and shit, but now it’s just an expected part of my every waking moment. Especially with working from home, I’m working high now too. Or was.

Recently got laid off and went back to school full time on loans. I can’t keep up with studying and am sleeping a total of like 15 hrs a day. No way can I also hold a job with this schedule, and I’ve run out of money.

2021-10-30 19:34:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qjdb0o/my_experience_with_anxiety_attacks_quitting_weed/,"My experience with anxiety attacks quitting weed, and how I got better","I figured I'd write my experience in hope it's helpful to someone--reading yours definitely brought some relief during tough times.

I had been on and off weed for some time, mostly because I travel a lot and it isn't always available/legal. During the pandemic I had to stay put and had plenty of weed, so I smoked every day for 8 months. 

Anxiety was mounting but I didn’t want to pay attention, until one morning having my usual morning coffee I experienced my first full-blown anxiety attack. Then everything changed. I couldn't think straight, I was catastrophizing, believing I was about to lose my mind and everything I had in life. Insomnia set in fast and strong. I couldn't sleep for more than a couple of hours. I couldn't breathe properly and it was next to impossible to calm down. I started having palpitations every day around 19:30, the time I used to smoke. 

I quit cold turkey. I started therapy, and investigated how to deal with this to no avail. I learned CBT techniques, made sure to exercise and eat healthy every day (which I was already doing before) but nothing changed much. 

I tried pretty much every supplement for mood and sleep. Nothing gave more than some temporary relief, and most didn't make a difference at all after a couple days of use.

I want to share what really made a difference for me. It’s been almost a year, and life has been good. It’s been a slow and painful process but I got out as a different (hopefully better) person. And as usual, YMMV.

I now realize weed itself wasn't the problem, but the fact that I abused it to stay comfortable and euphoric at all times--despite what was happening in my life. It became the easy way out--if I was worried or anxious about something, felt an uncomfortable emotion or just a bit sad, a couple of puffs would sweep it under the rug. The problem is that the emotions don't go away, but remain in the back of your mind, unprocessed, because you are unwilling to face them--and it turns into a time bomb. 

The one thing that got me out of this--more than any supplement, diet, exercise or CBT technique--was serious meditation.

At first I was meditating every other day for 10 minutes with inconsistent results. I felt better immediately afterwards but it wouldn't last long. I consulted a Yoga teacher who suggested a minimum of an hour a day, and gave me a recording of a guided mindfulness meditation. That's when I began experiencing results.

I believe one problem with anxiety attacks is that the mind itself has been hijacked--so you can't reason your way out, because being an emotional mess you can't realize not everything you think is necessarily true or needs to be addressed. And if you aren't sleeping well, the mind has even less bandwidth to process negative emotions. Meditation helps quiet down the constant chatter, get out of your head, and stop the mind from relentlessly trying to tackle the ghosts it creates.

It’s said that meditation can make you feel worse sometimes, and it’s true—but that’s because you are stopping for once, and letting your feelings and fears resurface. It’s uncomfortable, but it gave me an opportunity to face my troubles instead of letting them rule me from the unconscious.

It made a huge difference to me. I’m sleeping well, I'm less fearful and I can basically live my life.

Some additional thoughts I found useful:

\-Don't feel sorry for yourself. This is important. Everyone goes through difficult times--approach yours with courage and optimism

\-Don’t feel bad for feeling bad. Sometimes you'll feel pretty good, sometimes like trash. Have self compassion and see that the body and mind have rythms

\-It might seem impossible now, but know that you WILL feel better. Hang in there.

i'm a nearly 43 using a throwaway account since my addiction is definitely something i'm not proud of. I started doing weed at 13, at first only when chilling with friends or at parties 'cause my parents would have killed me, then almost 10 years later i went living alone and started smoking everyday regularly. I can say it's more than 20 years that i spent almost every day of my life being high. I thought about quitting several times during this time but what always made it so hard is that i pretty much always lived a happy life. I got parents and relatives who always loved me (but nobody ever knew about my habits), a good career, several girls and friends, no money problems or whatsoever... so, the real problem is i had no real reason to stop smoking. Nevertheless i had the feeling something was wrong and while i always enjoyed being high i started thinking about how much it slowed down my life, about how many things i could have accomplished but i didn't because i settled for what i had. My last relationship was the perfect example: she was an even heavier smoker than me, we were spending almost all our free time together getting high at home, getting laid, watching shows and playing games. I was satisfied with that, despite knowing i was not in love anymore and that this relationship was even more toxic than weed itself. I knew i could have, and deserved, something better, but it was just... enough. It took 8 years to finally broke up and it's been one of the best things happened in years, even though i'm now in the middle of my life and never got married or kids. Then one of my friends told me about this sub, i started reading and reading, and immediately felt a sense of relief. I started getting a clearer idea of what i always refused to consider a true addiction, a phrase in a post especially caught me: weed is very jealous, at first she seduces you and then she wants you all for herself. One week ago i had to leave for a business trip where i wasn't able to bring anything to smoke, i thought it was a good chance to start my new life, now i'm back and on my 7th day without even tobacco. I'm trying to get busy with everything i can: daily job, workout, playing guitar, seeing friends, etc. but i'm still craving so hard... Today was the kind of day that i love for smoking: rain, no work and plenty of time to play videogames while high, which is something i so love to do... i hold out, but still craving... i thought sharing my experience here could help, i know how weak i am and i think keeping a sort of journal of my progress would be of huge support for keeping me on track, i just hope not to be annoying or breaking any sub rules.

I, like many of you, have been a hardcore daily user since the age of 18. I'm 23 now. I don't want to dive deep into the personal reasons why I was that way, but just wanted to share my personal thoughts on the recovery process.

Many people see recovery as a straight line. You're either on it, or you're off. Me personally, I don't think it was helpful seeing it that way. 

You always have to keep in mind where you started. I personally started tackling the habit in mid August and ever since I managed to obtain for 14, sometimes only 6 days until I relapsed. Instead of giving in and thinking: ""oh man I'll never get over it"" I decided to take it step by step and so should you if you're not powerful enough to give up for good instantly. This habit shaped itself into your brain for probably years, so be patient with yourself and give your brain time to heal.

you were clean for 3 days and relapsed? Man, that's a great accomplishment. Think about what made you relapse and get back on track. Take it day by day and celebrate even the small victories. Everybody in it's on pace, as long as you go continuously. 

I personally was smoking alone most of the time. I decided whenever I'd relapse the only rule should be to not smoke alone, but in company. 

Currently on day 16. I got used to being sober step by step and now I'm ready to give up the habit for good. I realized that sugar helped me get over the low's and I wouldn't recommend it to any of you, but at least it's a temporary aid. 

Also this might not be the right approach for all of you, at least it was for me. 

Thank you for all the love and help you post on here. I'm proud to be a part of this tribe.

Only the best to all of you.",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.63846856}"

Starting to give me severe panic attacks.","I (41 f) have smoked or had some edibles every night for 3 or 4 years now. Mostly to help with stress--I'm a mom with a special needs kiddo so once she's in bed (my husband works nights, 6-7 days a week, and that's really hard on both of us as we never get time together that we aren't just doing parental duties) I would take some rips from a bong or have some edibles or whatever. I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder 8 years ago, not long after my daughter was born. Stress induced probably, and a form of post-partum depression. SEVERE panic attacks--like landed me in the ER several times because I thought for sure my heart was about to explode and I was going to die. NOT a fun time when you're home alone with a small baby. Didn't smoke then, but my state went legal a few years ago.  


My brother works for a pretty large grow facility and was always able just to toss me tons of pot whenever I wanted for extremely cheap. For a few years, it really helped me get some rest. Then, last year, I had a WEIRD panic episode just like a few years ago when I landed in the ER. Extreme fear, heart pounding, chest pain, dizzy, thought I was going to pass out-- took a bit of a break from smoking, went back to it, felt OK.  


Then a few weeks ago it happened again, even worse. For HOURS and in waves. Fortunately my husband had a rare night off and was there to help. Tried a small puff last night and could feel another panic attack coming on--fortunately talked myself down from it.  


So that's it for me. I can't handle going through severe panic attacks again--that's a nightmare I'd never wish on ANYONE because it's truly hell.  


So, other than the one puff last night, I've been sober about 2 weeks now. I'm super fatigued and really grumpy, not sleeping the best, and really depressed. I think depression is probably a big underlying cause of what's going on and pot is making it worse now, not better. This pandemic has been really hard on our family, we've lost a few family members, my daughter's therapy just closed doors for over a year (finally back to in-person, but their budget got cut so now it's only twice a month when she really needs it at least once a week), just a horrible time.  


Realized I had dropped all my hobbies over the past few years. Used to do a lot of art--haven't touched my tablet in years. Actually have a few books published--stopped writing, haven't done shit on a re-boot series of my weird western saga I wanted to get done. Just feels like all I've done the past few years at night is smoke pot and watch weird Youtube videos and stress about how awful the world is and how hopeless it all feels.  


I'm not having many physical withdrawal symptoms except fatigue and not sleeping well, but mentally I feel so drained and apathetic. I suspect that will clear up, and I'm trying to get back to my writing and my hobby art again (holy shit does it look bad--my skills have gone to absolute rust, but that's to be expected).

Not to mention half of them feature weed. I need some advice or something, I don't know what to do and I'm getting desperate for some real rest.","Sorry in advance for the long-ass post. No TL;DR because I don't know what to leave out to sum it up.

I have no idea if anyone has any advice for this but the weird dreams haven't stopped and it's been five weeks. It happens every night. Three solid weeks of dreams with maybe one or two semi-dreamless nights after being particularly exhausted.

In every other dream at some point, I'm offered the opportunity to smoke, and I usually end up taking it. I wake up with intense cravings.

I don't get why this is happening. I've read about how weed represses REM and all that stuff but then, why didn't this happen to me last time? There was one time only a year ago, when I was still smoking, that I didn't have weed available for almost two months, and my dreams were nowhere \*near\* as frequent as they are now. The conclusion I've come to is that it's my brain throwing a temper tantrum at me for deciding to quit, and using lucid dreams to do it.

I should add extra context as to why this is such a problem--I swear to God I'm not trying to be a special snowflake here, I swear, but I *genuinely* dream different from most people.

Five years ago I tried to train myself to lucid dream and either I did it wrong, or my brain is wired in such a way that it didn't take correctly. After months of doing all the tips and tricks and pre-sleep meditations, I never quite achieved the kinds of lucid dreams I was going for--you know, where you've got full control over it all and get to play around in wonderland--but I must have done *something* to my brain because it permanently changed the way I dream.

I have what I call half-lucid dreams. Like lucid dreams, I feel like I'm in real life, and I'm fully present, mentally speaking. (According to my husband, I move around a lot and talk in the real world when I'm dreaming.) Everything is very detailed to the point I can always read numbers and sentences (which is apparently not something one is usually able to do in dreams,) and I have 100% full control over my own thoughts and actions, but unlike lucid dreams, I have no control over the 'setting' of the dream or the people which populate it, nor do I ever realize I'm dreaming until the point at which I wake up, no matter how strange or improbable things become. It feels like I'm in real life, and they're often mentally exhausting to the point which I wake up more tired than when I went to bed.

Usually, I'd have these kinds of dreams once, *maybe* twice a week on rare occasions, and mostly they would be strange as opposed to outright stressful. These ones recently have been *very* stressful and seem to revolve around various insecurities and fears I've had over my lifetime. And they're still as strange as always.

Space stations with giant panoramic windows flying across the universe as it's being destroyed; slow-motion atomic bombs dropped in cities with streets as narrow as hallways; animal-people being hunted down; twisting underground tunnels opening at random and taking me to new dreams; neighborhoods mashed up of every place I've lived all overgrown and derelict; The silty bottom of a deep ocean populated with nightmare creatures, inexplicably dimly lit like a dusky sunset, with water that feels and breathes like air; giant rainbow soap bubbles following me that I swear to god have ill intent and won't pop no matter how hard I try; streets and roads that are tall and windy and topsy-turvy like roller-coaster tracks with cars that have no doors that speed along like racecars; cruise ships forty stories high that wobble and bend like rubber but never seem to tip over on seas that are black and stormy; and so much more, but you get the idea.

During the dream it doesn't matter how impossible it is, I believe it's 100% real until I wake up. Sometimes I even think I'm a completely different person during the dream, like a week ago, when I thought I was a 12-year old boy, living with an abusive mother who had psychic powers, in a castle-sized ancient mansion older than the earth it was built on, populated with other children, and filled harlequin-dressed servants who had no voices and who lived in a city of shacks in a swamp at the foot of the hill we lived on.

In that dream, there was a point at which one of the kids I shared the mansion with, a teenager, offered me to partake of a strange-smelling herb. Two guesses what the herb was. I can't escape the fucking weed even in my dreams, no matter how outlandish they are! In the cruise-ship dream there was a sauna filled with marijuana smoke! In the derelict-neighborhood dream I found my old weed stash, as fresh as new! With the animal-people, I was invited to take part in a spiritual ritual involving a pipe and herbs!

I have no idea what to do about this and I'm so, fucking, *tired*, all the time, and I'm sick of waking up with cravings that are stronger than anything I experience during the day.

I'm honestly scared they won't stop.

I get this is kind of a weird situation but I really, really hope someone has advice. Some drug I can ask my GP for or meditations I can practice or excercise I can do or something, *anything*, I *need* this to *stop*. I wish I had never practiced lucid dreaming. The dreams are cool and all but the constant state of exhaustion and stress isn't fucking worth it.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6593074}"

It has been 52 days since my last time. This marks the first time in a decade that I manage this long without substitute with alcohol to get me through the hard times. 

Lethargy is hitting me hard. My attention span is non-existent. Depression does not leave me. And I feel as if I’m slowly drowning.

This time is the first time I quit out of my own volition and not because I was mentally, physically and financially drained. I quit because I wanted another path to follow, than the one that, without fail, leads me towards despair, no matter my grand ideas about “moderation” or regulate my using in some way. It always ends up with me using all day, everyday. 

I worked towards it all summer - no strict regime, I merely changed my habits up a bit (even though I didn’t change the volume of which I smoked, I decreased wake and bake and such things) I walked daily and went swimming. 
The plan was to cultivate good habits that would make it easier for me to maintain sobriety, so far this has gone very well. I go to the pool almost daily and have completely avoided “the sweats”, I have not experienced any insomnia and I get at least 7hr each night. I have also been going to meetings, talked immediately with my family and told them what was up (they ofc new but we did not talk about it) and have relied heavily on them since, which has helped so much and really been working on my relationship with them was “strained” because of my isolating out of shame. 

However, after day 40 something I started being lethargic and so depressed that I have contemplated talking to my dr and get anti-depressants (maintaining some avoidant behavior is a must after all). I also eat, like I have made it a sport now, just cannot stop, currently it is one of few places I get a dopamine fix from but this is not sustainable for the long run so I strive to change that eventually, but it is not a priority.

I was a heavy user, for years - smoked 2-3-4 grams a day on average. Can somebody tell me that this is indeed normal and that I will not be feeling like this indefinitely? I hardly get any cravings, I am so done with weed and I will not be wanting to go through this another time. What can I do? Has anyone experienced similar things? Am i doomed to be gloomy for the rest of my days?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4647948}"

It’s me again. My first week for the second time. Last time it was 100 days before I dropped the ball. Haven’t had an alcoholic drink in 1.5 years and now I want to kick out the herb habit. 
Last time I noticed that I turned obsessed with working and then I started looking at weed to be able to relax and “check out” from work. A demanding job and then coming home to parent two very active kids, weed gives the illusion that I can relax and be a better parent for my kids. Takes the edge off so I am not treating my kids like my employees in a way and can be a more patient parent and perhaps more in the moment than I am sober. Same goes for me as a spouse. 
A second part is the spurt of energy I gain from stopping weed -I am literally looking for more and more projects and if not possible to fulfill that need, i just get more agitated.

And then AS soon as I come out and say ""You know what, because if it's in the house I gotta smoke it.""  Then they go (in a revealing, troubled tone) ""ME TOO MAN!!!""

I am doing well, but I can't control these feelings of self-loathing. I wish I was able to smoke a bit, but I know that will result in me smoking every day. I have the great ability of tricking myself. It all starts with one pull, followed by more self-hatred, leading to flushing it all down the toilet and then back to smoking on a daily basis.

I really want to smoke like a normal person, but I'm aware of my weakness. I'm just afraid I'll fuck up and be back to smoking every day again. My problem is that there are times where I feel like smoking very much just to get away from my family problems, work and several other issues.

Im 21 years old and been smoking for 6 years now(started to smoke all day everyday 3 years ago).

I eventually got into a traffic stop. I was not high but for some reason they wanted my pee. Of course the thc test was positive. So I have to do a thing called MPU here in germany. That means I have to give up my drivers license and can only get it back if all test results during 1 year are negative(this is the easy part...the hard part is that at the end you have a talk with a psychiatrist for a few hours and he determines if I am endangering other people if I drive...over 50% fail at the first try. Not only that but you even have to pay nearly 1000€ everytime you try again.)

I have joined this subreddit a few months ago because I had to quit smoking...I thought I did it. 

I was clean for 3 months but when I was on vacation I thought to myself: „You know what? I think Im ready. Im not addicted anymore so 1 Joint a month or so wont be bad.“ Yeah guys I really was this naive. It quickly became 1 Joint a week, then daily...eventually I was in the same spot as before...smoking all day and doing nothing else.

This is my second try and Im clean for 3 days now. I dont know why but its so much harder then before.
I havent felt this depressed in a long time and I cant seem to eat anything. Im hungry but I just dont want to eat, I dont want to go to sleep cause I know I cant sleep, I dont want to do anything because I wont enjoy it. My temper is also a huge problem now...I get mad at the tiniest things. But the thing that bothers me the most is the feeling of emptiness and the internal unrest.
So Im writing this in hopes that this helps me get through this shit and to get this off my chest cause I dont really want do talk about it with my friends and family. Im sure you guys all know how hard it is to say: Yes I am addicted.

I guess that’s understandable. If you haven’t been through it then it’s difficult to relate.  I think before I quit my family thought it was just a simple decision. But it was hard, really hard. Not just the quitting part but staying clean in the months afterwards. I had to  and still have to shoot down every reason the voice in my head gives me to smoke again.
I was really down bad when I was addicted. I didn’t work. I work for doordash and I was only working enough to buy weed for that day. It made me angry and emotional all the time and it almost broke up my marriage. I’m really thankful for my husband for dealing with my bs.
I understand weed isn’t something like heroine or harder drugs but it was an addiction nevertheless and I feel like it ruined my life. My reason for quitting was to go back to what I used to be before my friend introduced it to me and before I was addicted for 7 years. But I feel like I can never be like I was before. Weed is always going to control me if I smoke it or not. Of course life is better without weed but I feel like I’ll never really be free of it like I thought I would, especially since it’s legal in my state and everyone in my apartment complex smokes it. Tonight I was walking from the parking lot to our front door with my husband and there were two different residents smoking weed on their balcony. I told my husband it feels like I’ll never be free even though I feel like I’ve tried so hard these last 8 months, and that everyone else can have fun doing it at parties or whenever their friends or family gets together but I’m the one who has to stay sober and miss out. He told me he doesn’t want to hear it. I guess I was being a little dramatic but I feel frustrated when people around ek think it’s just a simple thing not to smoke.

(TLDR @ bottom) I've been smoking cannabis for about 7 years daily, but the past 3 or 4 years it has been a habit where I was never sober if I was awake no matter what I was doing because I smoked constantly throughout the day. For the last two years, I also have gotten into wax and vape carts, but I decided to quit earlier this summer because it was really rough on my lungs. Over the course of my use, I have quit a few times, with the longest being 4 months. The only reason I've ever quit was because I didn't have money or access. However, I did take a 4 week break a couple months ago because I was sitting at home all day smoking and it was taking like 5 dabs to catch a small buzz and I just felt generally unhappy about my use.

I've been wanting to quit for a while, but I don't have any ""good"" reasons. Any real reason I can think of I can find away around. For example, I wanted to quit because I'm trying to lose weight and it causes me to binge snacks, so instead I just decided to smoke before meals or before going to the gym. I decided to quit for good a few days ago for a few vague reasons, such as trying to get my physical and mental health in order, having more ambition and energy, and not wanting to go through life high so I never have to really feel my emotions. I also want to be able to just say that I'm 100% sober since it has been over 2 years since non-weed drug use, and over 1 year since alcohol and cigarettes. 

The biggest issue that I'm facing is that I'm very new to my sobriety, and I don't have a lot of willpower. I can control myself on my own, but next week I am moving to Oregon where not only weed is cheap and everywhere, but my best and her husband live there. I'm very close with them, and their lives seem to revolve around getting stoned. Like, to the point where they get behind on their bills because they spend too much at the dispensary and borrow money for weed from people and say it's for bills/diapers/food/etc. They always have flower and wax, they smoke constantly, and every time I'm around them we've always smoked as an activity. Our friendship has a lot of history that has to do with smoking together as a group. I know they will offer, probably multiple times even after I tell them I'm not interested ( like they'll forget or just think I'm making a dumb choice). Even if they don't pressure me, I know I will be around them when they are toking because it never stops with them. 

I am looking for suggestions and support about having willpower when I am put in a situation like that because I don't really *want* to quit. I know I need to because I have had the nagging feeling to quit for years, and I am working on trusting what my body says to me. It would be easier if I was becoming sober for a job or something because then I would be ""unable"" to smoke, but I'm not sure what to do to help convince myself to stay strong in the moment since there's nothing actually keeping me from smoking. Sorry for the long post, all advice welcome! Thanks so much!

I’ve been a heavy daily smoker for about 3 years now. I have no idea when I went from regular, fun, social smoking to I need this to function or it’s gonna be a bad day but at some point I did. 

And then my sleep went bad. 

And then my depression was handing me my ass every day whether I smoked or not. 

So I’m here. Trying to get a grip on this in some way. I got upset earlier today and now there’s a part of my brain that says “just smoke, you’ll feel better” but I know not for long. It’ll fix this, but not the heavy feeling my brain will get once I’m high. It’s like lately the smoking makes things worse but I still can’t stop. 

When I get high I feel sluggish and my brain feels heavy. My mood dips after a bit. It’s like a bad come down. But I keep fucking doing it. 

It makes me feel so weak and ridiculous when I end up smoking and get that shitty feeling. 

Idk man I’m really just venting. Because If I keep sitting here thinking about it alone I’ll end up smoking.

It's crazy to think I use to smoke so much and be so constantly high that I wasnt going anywhere in life. Living in a world without getting high all the time has felt strange at times. It has made me see alot of things differently and do alot of things differently. I still have trouble with alot of the same things I did before but I'm more likely to try and work threw them. 

I have a goal im finally working towards, I got a new job, my fiance and I are closer than before. I didnt think much could change especially in 46 days from not smoking but I gained alot of positives even if I am still struggling with the same problems (social anxiety, procrastination and lack of motivation) I'm more likely to atleast try and break the chain that binds me in those areas. 

Lately though I've had really intense urges I dont think I wrote about why I smoked so much near the end of me smoking (and what gave me the final push on top of getting sober to get a new job and follow my dreams)  but I was in a car crash a couple years ago that left me with a spinal injury the last couple years the amount I smoked ramped up alot with the moments I was in pain. I've been on steriod injections for a bit so the pain came and go less intensely unless it was a work day than sometimes it hurt alot. My last injection seems to have warn off and my back hurts alot and all I want to do is smoke. Its alot to deal with but I gotta figure out some way to distract myself in these times. I'm trying the best I can but man its hard to say no to your demons when your in pain but I know I can make it threw.

I drop in periodically and get super inspired by your stories! So this weekend, I dropped the weed... and it has been 4 d 17 h 1 m 35 s as I type that I have been clear-headed. It was EIGHTEEN YEARS and I already have reclaimed my power - just this week! Weed helped me overcome depression initially, but the antidote became the poison. I would get periodic mandatory breaks because I worked as a wilderness guide and would be out in the mountains or along coastlines for 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks and up to 3 months once - with no hope for any ganja and so I could manage knowing that it simply wasn't an option, and living nature is stunning and hard work and requires full presence. But EVERY single time I came back, I would count down hours and minutes to get my first puff. I have NEVER been able to quit at home (with access) with success.

But the time came. I am launching a small business, have been struggling with it for six months- was shy to go on camera with my puffy face and still-red-eyes that no amount of red-out drops could solve, and I was tired and self-conscious and discouraged so easily and the pipe or a joint was the only coping mechanism I let myself develop. Enough is enough. And so it was. This week I have booked four new coaching clients, a gig to tutor an executive, and have two new young students on a teaching platform I use. My vibration is already raised and I am over the moon!

I tried half-heartedly to quite a couple months ago, but not with my whole heart. Now I am- with my whole heart, with humility and patience and the self-love and forgiveness that I resisted. And I cannot explain to you guys the gratitude I feel for myself for a clear head, for no afternoon lows and no headaches and no needs for caffeine and more weed to solve the symptoms. I have walked by the roaches I have found around the house and gotten rid of them with love, thanking the sacred grass that was my medicine and no longer is. I found a vape pen still with a charge and said goodbye as well. I even have a loved one at home that is able to some weed sometimes, (not every single second!), and enjoy it; I enjoyed the memory of the aroma and moved away from it.

I already look more beautiful because I am sticking to my word. I am not a naive person, I am grown and woke, and know that everything changes; I don't anticipate no bumps in the road, but today I am filled with gratitude.

Signing off for a bit to go finish a project - just wanted to leave this here. Will check back in later tonight. Clear-headed, full-hearted, and full of faith that every one of us can embody the version of ourselves that we truly desire to be.

A little back story: I used to smoke weed occasionally during the last year of high school/sixth form and during uni/college. Became a full stoner (nearly everyday) after getting my degree (finished 2019) and throughout covid. I went through a period of depression due to being diagnosed with a physical illness (keratoconus) which lasted a good couple months. Never really had any mental health issues before that and I never really understood anxiety or depression before that. Last year during a particular session, I suffered my first panic attack. I’ve been struggling to get to terms with going bald fairly early in my life so I’d have self conscious thoughts and that’s what probably triggered it. I think weed has given me anxiety when I’m sober but I’m not fully sure since I haven’t sought out help for it. 

My life isn’t that bad. I’ve got a good graduate job, a good relationship with my partner and friends. However I’ve realised this isn’t the best version of me. And I’m always looking for my next smoke. So I’ve decided to give quitting a chance. I’ve stopped a month or so every year due to Ramadan (yes I’m Muslim I shouldn’t be smoking lol). But stopping long term is probably going to be a struggle. 

Just wanted to ask, did weed give you anxiety when you weren’t high and has it reduced or gone since stopping? Have any of you tried therapy for those you got anxiety or used weed as a coping mechanism?

Thanks guys and it’s good to see people not be in denial about long term weed usage. Such a waste of energy and money",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4547011}"

I'm an introvert and a little neurotic in my thinking. While I'm doing much better now I've been spending a lot of time thinking about my past, my past behavior, choices, actions, inactions, avoidances, etc. Not all stems from drug use, at least not directly, but a lot of it does.

Here I sit in life, at 41 years of age, and starting over to a large extent. It's an opportunity not afforded to many yet I find myself stuck consuming energy from the past instead of projecting it towards the future.

Why is it that the past and events of my childhood and years gone by are often my subject of my thoughts? What an I searching for? Honestly I long for those days and would, in some ways, like to go back and relive days that are now an impossibility to relive.

The hope, ambition, awe, and wonder if the future have been lost on me. Is it my age, my experiences, what happened to the vigor and dreams I once had for life? Is it a mere illusion that I had a better and more optimistic view of the world back then or is it that I am selectively recalling only the good moments, and false memories. 

I do believe that addiction and my struggles with it played a major role in landing me on this space in the game of life. It's now up to be to make the most of each moment, set achievable goals, cultivate dreams and ambition and move forward in this thing called life.

Coming off was misery but some how I got busy with life And forgot all about it! 

Don’t get me wrong there were plenty of times the thought of smoking on a Friday after a long work week came up. 
Many of my clients smoke or eat edibles to relax and I have been envious at times.

I really feel I got to a place where even when I had the urge to go to the smoke shop and pick up a delta 8 vape. My body would remind me how sick it would make me feel. 

That feeling alone was enough for me to keep going and not relapse.

My ultimate form of motivation for quitting is wanting to be pregnant soon. I have also changed my diet some as well. 

Deep 4-4-8 breaths helped tremendously during the first couple week when sleep was difficult. 

My biggest win is saying no to the person I thought was my friend who would try to bribe me with weed. 
I told her “nah this time I am done”
She didn’t like that. But oh well.

I felt very empowered to say No to her.

Some do not like the fact that there are those of us trying to quit. Why? Because it makes them have to face themselves and their addiction with weed even if they feel they do not have one. Some do not or are not ready to face that reality yet.

I was anxious, depressed, no will do to anything as nothing was satisfying me enough but weed. Everyday after work I started with one joint and smoked about 2-4 per day until I passed out and went to sleep.  


After some time I got fed up with my life. I was angry at everyone but me, because I thought everything bad that was happening around me was because of others not me. In meantime I switched work, and started to hang out with people that don't smoke at all, and I was the only one doing so. I didn't understood why they were so happy all the time and without weed. How they actually can be? So I started researching what actually could be causing my depression and anxiety.  


I watched some YouTube videos and after few hours of being high and browsing the internet I stumbled upon this subreddit. I was reading few post there, filtered the top ones and was thinking. What if it's actually weed that is causing all the problems? I told myself that night (22.9) that this is the last joint I am smoking any weed till the end of the year. If there won't be any changes, I simply return and will start smoking again.   


On the next day, I packed my grinder, papers, filters, bong and everything else I had for smoking. I went out and threw everything to the nearest trash. I felt bad when I knew I had to say goodbye to weed as I loved getting stoned every night. But my future was more important this time.  


The first week, was one of the worst weeks of my life. I didn't slept at all or for about 2-4 hours per night. I was angry, anxiety and depression were even worse. I almost relapsed as I thought smoking again will be the only option how to fall asleep. At this point I called all of my friends and told them to not sell or give me any weed, even if I would come and beg for it. They told me that I am starting to be crazy and I should smoke some, but they understood what I am trying to achieve and didn't gave me any.  


On the second week, the depression and anxiety got better. I still got cravings and wasn't able to fall asleep but when I did, I was able to have longer sleep.  


After two weeks I was able to sleep every night for about 6h per night. The cravings went away and I wasn't aggressive at all. Unfortunately depression and anxiety was still there. I started to feel more emotions towards everything. I started to feel alive from time to time.  


Fast forward to today today... Oh boiiiii... Today I woke up and felt happy? Right after I felt full of energy, my focus today is SHARP! I am feeling well and my depression seems to be gone? Anxiety is still there but just parts of it. I believe this is only a beginning and it will only get better and better.  


Please if you are considering to stop, DO IT! This was the best choice I could make this year. And even in the beginning I thought only till the end of the year... I won't smoke weed anymore!

I found myself unable to think of literally anything to say when talking to strangers, not confident enough to speak much in group settings, and just feeling inadequate/unmotivated in general. I have ADHD so it was very easy for me to just smoke to feel something and not really think about the bigger picture, not realizing it's been 6 years of this.

I took little breaks here and there, but this time has been quite different.  I quit initially at the end of June...only to relapse after finding an old PAX pen and some ""empty"" carts.  That was almost 2 months ago now.  Didn't get full hits but I definitely got a little stoned, so I pushed the timetable back I'm sure.  I threw all that shit away too that night after debating keeping it (glad I got rid of it).

Anyways, my anxiety is through the roof.  Not to mention my OCD in my own head, lots of negative thought loops leading to panic attacks.  It's the worst.  I've actually had attacks to where I disassociate from reality.  It's been to the point where I don't want to do anything because I'm literally afraid of getting panic attacks and feeling like I'm going to lose my mind, which in turn is making me depressed.  Recently (the last couple of weeks) I've had a lots of intrusive/unwanted thoughts, which really bother me emotionally.  I was doing okay for a while, but it seems like my anxiety has only gotten worse.

I guess I should also mention that I quit nicotine at the same time (at the end of June that is).  Of course I still have urges for both but they are significantly less frequent then they once were, but constantly feeling like shit and exhausted from the anxiety/panic attacks has been getting to me lately.  Been wondering if I'll ever be able to function normally again.  I have been working with my PCP and am waiting to hear from a behavioral health clinic, as I was masking some issues I'm sure I'm not even fully aware of yet by constantly getting high.

My dreams are becoming milder, yesterday my dream ended with me getting arrested (better than getting killed like earlier dreams). 

Apparently, first 2 weeks will be hard in terms of physical withdrawal symptoms, whereas the next two would be phycological.

I'm listing the positives that happened after quitting which will evaporate if i ever go back to smoking - 

1. Ability to leave house on short notice(earlier  i need to smoke a j or two just to step out of my house and i always felt like shit for making my friends wait for me).

2. Ability to go out more often.

4. I'm able to use better vocabulary and form thoughts in conversations.

5. I don't have the self pity of my current situation. Even though I'm at a bad position careerwise and personal, the improvements are apparent in this short span.

6. More time to spend with family (earlier i used to lock myself down in one room because I'm always rolling)

7. I lost almost 4 kg because now I'm able to spend 1-2 hours a day playing badminton.

I've quit before and it gets easier, as we know. Staying away from it for good is for another conversation. But, getting through that initial difficult transition (detox) is the biggest hurdle in my view.

Most people have never heard of water fasting, or think it's crazy. They think if you miss a meal that that literally constitutes ""starving"". Well, good friend, do a little research! I have to of course preface this by saying I AM NOT A DOCTOR. If you are medically cleared to water fast, I highly recommend it. Some documentaries in particular - *Science of Fasting* and *Fasting* are great ones.

So, what is it exactly? Simple: I consume no calories for at least 24 hours. The truth is, the average healthy person can go over a month without food. I am not advocating for this, but it's a testament to the human capacity and resilience. The body has nutrient stores. The body can synthesize nutrients. It's remarkably well prepared to be without food for a weekend. In fact, I would argue that constant consumption of nutrient-less food matter is a major cause of disease in today's world. Again, 'nother conversation.

I won't ramble, but watching the films really motivated me. Do your own research, too. YouTube testimonials are good. I know it sounds wild, but I AM TELLING YOU, it does something to my body and brain that is very powerful and therapeutic. Herbal tea is 0 calories, so I drink that all day. After 3 days, my hunger signals cease. The cells enter a catabolic state. Enter ketosis. Old pains might even go away. I seriously sleep so remarkably well during this time. It's an amazing time for reflection. I feel accomplished, clear, calm. And it is distracting, because for the first day or two I'm resisting food instead of the weed. And again, I am telling you, it does something to my mind. Il look at weed differently. It doesn't seem as appealing. It seems like it would fuck me up too much, make me too high, even if I've only been fasting for a day. I won't say it's a piece of cake, it's a challenge, but it's so rewarding after even just one day.

After using it for a while to escape my life and after realizing it was holding me back from actually fixing my life, I quit. 
But now, even after I’ve seen the good and bad, I can’t help but feel like I can’t live without it. Maybe it’s because I’m stuck in a situation where I won’t be able to be truly happy until I have enough financial freedom to peruse my own life, but I seriously cannot see myself living without smoking.

It’s hard because I want to quit and stay quit, but being sober has been hard enough on its own and now with the withdrawals and side effects of weed, it’s even harder. Regardless I keep finding myself looking back to smoking and how someway somehow I am convinced that I need it to live normally and be able to function.

I thought quitting would be easy but my god I had no idea how bad my withdrawals were gonna be.

late again. I toss and turn all night and don’t get any sleep. It’s more like dazing off for an hour, waking up, dazing off for an hour, and waking up. All night. I’m exhausted. I’m concerned. I will say that I have faith that everything will get back to normal. But I feel like it’s taking a long time. My quality of life is decreased because of my lack of sleep. I’m not taking any sleep medication because I want to get 100% back to normal without medication. 

I’m on day 20 right now, 100% sober and although I can tell my sleep is starting to improve slightly I still need some encouragement.

So about a week in here’s what I’ve noticed changing about myself personally: 

- alertness, my mind feels much quicker 

- adhd is much more manageable, i’m able to find the mental strength so focus on important tasks again 

- video games, I enjoy them much more sober and I remember what I was doing last time I played ! Stop listening to that voice that says oh man this would be so much better high, it’s not, last time you got super high and played you couldn’t even enjoy the games because you kept over analyzing them and couldn’t even understand how to play properly. 

- mental health, no longer feel down for no reason or unable to find energy to do things sober, don’t forget this either, normal tasks are not more fun high, half the time you just do nothing or start negative self talk because high you is an anxious insecure motherfucker who doesn’t believe in anything, don’t let him win. 

Really just don’t forget any of this, you’ve proven time and time again you can’t handle just one joint or an edible on the weekend because it always slowly turns into making excuses to smoke every day, just stop, you’re smarter than that and you know it. Unfortunately that inner loser stoner will probably be with you your entire life after you spent your teens and early 20s with no aspirations aside from getting high but you’re just gonna have to stop letting him back into the driver seat, he’s wrecked the car every time so stop believing this time you can control him from the passenger seat. 

But of a long ramble to myself but I wanted to put my thoughts into writing so maybe this time it’ll stick for good. I wish all of you the best in your personal journeys as well. Hope this helps.",101,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4136751}"

I feel as though my life is good and I am a successful and mature adult, but I feel as though marijuana is a crutch and that I could be more successful without it. I recently found this subreddit and every post I've read has resonated with me. I do not see any positive reason for smoking after I come home from work but I still do. I believe the time has come for me to really quit and I guess I'm looking for guidance.

I have a healthy relationship with my partner, our dog, a home that we share, a good and respectable job that I obtained after university and a positive relationship with family and friends. I think by all accounts, I am a fairly successful and well-balanced person. Maybe more importantly, I do not feel that there is anything particularly ""wrong"" with my life, just stuff that I would improve.

My partner does not smoke and is tolerant of my habit (and I really do have to give her credit for keeping me in check when it has gotten bad or when i start leaning on it more because I am going through a tough spot). I love cooking and cleaning when high with a podcast on. I love throwing a ball with my dog for an hour while high. I feel like I use it to kill what I see as some of the things that don't require my ""focus"" as much. I have struggled with depression throughout my life and I have relied on weed a lot during those times.

I think that is what I am struggling with is that I don't feel any ""harm"" but I also am well aware that my addiction is limiting who I am. I like playing music, but I always smoke weed before and then I don't push myself to really learn more or get better. I like getting high and exercising, and while I find it more enjoyable, I don't focus and push myself in the same way as when I work out sober (and let's be real I generally work out less when I regularly get high). I am junior in my field and I want to spend the extra hours now learning and improving myself before we have kids but instead of putting in the extra hours I smoke weed after work, watch TV, try and do a bit of reading but am too high and then dick around (for example last night spending two hours looking at usb hubs then ultimately buying a multi plug).

I get so frustrated with myself for it but then I'm right back at it again, even thinking about getting home in the evening so that I can get high and ""chill"". I think what I struggle with in terms of really quitting is that my life isn't so bad that its actively falling apart with weed - but I know deep down that I could make my life and myself better without it. I could do more for my partner, my dog, I would be better at keeping in touch with my friends and family (who I am since December living farther away from and therefore using more weed).

I have taken a month off of weed (and alcohol) here and there without problem - but it's always in my mind that I will eventually be able to smoke after the month is done. I guess I am looking for advice for how to get going on really quitting, particularly when your life isn't all shit because of it and where the fact that you're doing okay can fuck with your self-motivation for ultimately quitting and doing even better for yourself.

Would appreciate any wisdom (and in the meantime will keep reading through this subreddit). Thanks.",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.59836006}"

I have been smoking non stop for 22 years. I started heavy because it helped me deal with the trauma of losing my dad when I was young. I've smoked it almost every single day since then.

I got bronchitis a week ago, and not even that could stop me from smoking in the evenings. Now I'm lying in bed, having such a rough time breathing, I wish I could pass out but it's hard because of my cough.  There's this feeling of defenseless when you're sick that we tend to forget about until it's usually too late and then you wish you would have done it differently before but it is too late.

I have an awesome wife, three kids and another on the way, it feels so stupid to have to lie here in bed getting like a piece of garbage all because of how my addiction doesn't question the situation, it always wants. There's never a bad time, it does not care about me at all, regardless of how much it calls you me as this warm fuzzy bubble. It does not think of what would be best for me. I've let it take over of my life slowly, completely.

I have forgotten what it feels like to know myself in a natural state. Maybe that's another reason why it has been so hard in the past to quit, because I don't know who I would be without it, because usually when I'm without any it's just a matter of hours before I get more. I've said it so many times that I would quit. My attempts haven't lasted longer than three weeks at a time. No one believes me, and I don't blame them.

But today, as I'm lying here feeling like shit, having trouble breathing, I'm going to remember this moment and what I'm feeling now because I want to live a long life. I want to enjoy my future with my family, not having this ball and chain always dragging me behind. Tonight, I'm fucking done with this shit. It's been a fun ride, I won't lie, but now it's time to get off this slow train that's been running in a loop for over half of my life showing me the same routine over and over with no growth. Tonight I take back my control. 

That you for anyone here who hears/reads me. You don't need to believe me that I'll quit either. But it feels good to be able to tell it to someone and just admit how hard it has been to get this out of my life and be happy without it.

Me being stoned is not worth this feeling. I want to feel good about myself again on every level, on my own without a crutch to slow me down.

I quit with a very positive frame of mind, and I believe that this has helped the process immensely. I have a goal to get my bachelor's and master's of social work in 4 years. This would not happen if I spent every evening smoking weed and eating cake. Aside from the first 2 days, I have had very little desire to smoke.

Unfortunately, I have slept an average of 3-4 hours/night since I quit. I have a great evening routine that involves relaxation, no screens an hour prior to bed, chamomile tea, and a non-prescription sleep aid. I fall asleep within 15 minutes and then wake up 3-4 hours later and can't fall back asleep. 4 days ago I nearly smoked weed just so I could get some sleep, but somehow I convinced myself not to. That night, I still had a shitty sleep, but I experienced my first dreams since quitting, very bizarre dreams. In one of them, I started smoking weed again and then woke up with the same guilt and shame that I would have had if I actually smoked and damn was I angry until I realized it was just a very vivid dream. I am glad I had this dream. I actually experienced the horrible feeling without actually relapsing. Like I said, bizarre. I hope that the dreams returning is a sign of my sleep coming back. But I also know it can take many months.

I mostly posted this for those who are thinking about giving up. Don't—trust me, you will regret it.

If anyone has any advice on extending my sleep, I'll try almost anything (except prescription medication). I am so exhausted that I am experiencing hallucinations and my brain is reading words in the wrong order. It is messed up! If any words in this post are in the wrong order, you know why :)

I was smoking at least 2 blunts a day maxing out around 5 or 6 day. Well some stuff happened at work and I was shuffled around and led on for multiple positions and that's when I decided ""fuck it I'll be a driver"". I currently have to wait for a ticket to fall off my record so my company will pay for my CDL and I tried timing to coincide with when I'd be clean so I wouldn't have to waste any time in between. 
I've been down this road before and I know itll get better as time goes on and I get used to it but fuck I've been miserable the last couple days. It's been a full 24hours since my last bit of greens, the day before was very light usage. 
The issue I've created for myself if you were paying attention at the top is that I smoked blunts and now I'm essentially quitting tobacco at the same exact time.
Physically I feel better my stomach isnt cramping as much nor am I as constipated as 3 years ago but mentally I'm in a much worse place and my work schedule isnt doing me any favors waking up at 2:30 am every morning and leaving around 11:30-1:30pm. 
I have no intentions of smoking and I know this was a long rant more than anything but I dont feel I can talk to my girl about it and after just one day I'm not doing too hot I just wanna slam my head through a wall I feel so frustrated by everything all the time like I'm just here and none of my decisions in life matter since I'll just get fucked one way or another. Reddit has always had answers for me I'm not necessarily looking for answers but fuck idk how I'm gonna get through this.

Last night I smoked weed for the third night in a row after 18 days sober from weed. I’m almost 11 months sober from booze which seemed infinitely easier to quit than the weed but I think that's because even when the booze was gone I still had a crutch in the weed. Anyway I had been wanting to smoke weed for a few days and it was like this itch that I could not scratch and I ordered delivery - 2 packs of mini joints.  I could’ve just gotten one pack but no, I had to go ahead and get two. Smoked a joint three nights ago, and just fell so fast down the slope. Right back to exactly where I was when I quit.  I am disappointed in myself but not as much as I thought I would be and I’m angry with myself but not as angry as I thought I would be; in fact I felt more guilt and anger and disappointment just thinking about smoking then after actually smoking.  PLEASE someone tell me your secret for finding that motivation deep inside you to just stay quit.

You can’t quit if you don’t realize with yourself why you’re quitting, just to quit is probably the easiest part, it’s when you sober that you actually realize that quitting weed is about *getting your life together* not just the action of quitting and thinking things will magically work out for themselves.

I believe in you!,"I, like many other people, didn’t think weed was addictive. But after a long while of breaking all the “rules” I put in place (e.g only smoke after kids are asleep, only smoke after work, only smoke at lunch, smoke constantly) I started to suspect I had a problem. 

COVID intensified this. When everyone was stocking up on essentials I was buy a ton of weed because I was so afraid the dispensaries would close (ofc they didn’t)

Then I was smoking so much I couldn’t even really get high. I was chasing that morning buzz. The only one that would even happen. It sucked and I kept doing it anyway.

Then I tried to quit and got 30 days then I relapsed hard. Was down for the count for a few months and began to break promises to myself yet again. 

I stumbled onto Marijuana Anonymous and that was the game changer. Now I’m not saying it is for everyone and I really struggled with the higher power thing because I don’t believe in god…. Or at least not the one from my religion growing up. I made the groups and the wisdom of other sober people my higher power. Again not trying to push it at all I’m just sharing what worked for me. 

Even if you don’t do MA one of the critical take aways for me was to surround yourself with sober people and get their numbers so you can lean on them when you feel weak.I truly believe the opposite of addiction is connection and *that* is how I’ve stayed sober for as long as I can remember since I was 15. 

My message is don’t give up. The first few weeks can SUUUUCK. No doubt. But it gets better. I feel clear headed, I have motivation, I have good friends and I don’t crave weed. I’ve learned I cannot moderate my intake because I don’t have an off switch when I use. I just have to not do it now. Like my sponsor says, “the only way to win against Mike Tyson is to not get in the ring”. 

So for all of you struggling or thinking about taking the first step, please know it can be done. If someone as far gone into weed such that it was part of my identity can do it so can you. Stay strong. I believe in you.",53,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49342334}"

I'm 49 and have been a daily weed smoker/vaper for about 4 years. During that time my health has been on a slow downward spiral, right into the crapper. I've gained 30 pounds, as I have zero will power about food when I'm high. I've neglected every single one of my many hobbies and interests. I'm into so many things - skiing, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, remodeling houses, building computers, many more. I'm a jack of all trades. But for the last 4 years I've been a master of nothing but weed and Netflix. It's incredible how this little plant has the power to block out everything else in life, and I've allowed it to change me from a vital, energetic person into a fat hermit stoner.

Which sounds really negative, and I don't mean it to. I have an amazing life that I'm excited to get back to, starting today!!!

1. as with many of us on this sub, my problem is STAYING quit. There is no moderation for me. If I quit for a month and then reward myself with a joint, I'm back to daily use immediately. So I have to treat it as an alcoholic treats a drink - not even one. 
2. the support of a tribe makes a huge difference. Unfortunately most of my IRL friends either use weed or have never used and can't relate at all, so this sub has been incredibly helpful. I continue to draw strength from your stories, struggles and victories.

But when you stop smoking, you realize all of the depth from weed was an illusion, and you are back to a regular, insignificant life. I'm speaking for myself, I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't feel this way, but I feel as if all depth that I created while high 24/7 has left me.

I realize I was always this lost person, and used weed to escape that instead of actually trying to dive into the meaning of this lost feeling.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52551246}"

I’m currently 6 months sober from smoking weed and I gotta say I don’t feel any different/better.

I’m 21 years old and started smoking when I was 18 going on 19. It started casual and was only a nightly thing but quickly turned into everyday and then turned into 24/7 every second of every day. I developed a really severe binge eating disorder and gained 50 pounds over the pandemic. On top of that I had intense brain fog and horrific memory I knew it was time to quit.

Well, one fateful day in May I finally did it. In the past I took short breaks for 3-7 days and in those days I felt energized, motivated, not overly hungry or “binge-y”, and my head just felt clearer. I was excited to start feeling that all the time again and get my life back. Well, I am now 6 months in and I can honestly say I feel the exact same way I did when I was smoking everyday. 

I feel stupider. I’m not good with my words anymore I literally can’t form proper sentences and I have forgotten how to use words I used to use often. I feel completely dissociated from reality and myself. I feel like a totally empty shell of a person. And though I’m not binging excessively I’m still eating poorly because of this just uncontrollable need to fill this void. 

It just makes me feel shitty and like there was no point in quitting. And it also makes me think that I just permanently damaged myself and I’ll never feel like myself again.

we had to leave shortly after i took that single hit because i was overwhelmingly high, the anxiety was terrible. like a horrible feeling of dread and heat burning up my whole body. i felt so bad that i was causing us to leave early and i was really trying to hold myself together and not panic. 

my girlfriend was very sweet and understanding, she told me that i was going to be okay, that she was excited to start a new show we’d been talking about once we got back to her dorm, and that she thinks we’re the sort of couple to leave parties early and she thinks it’s sweet. i’m very grateful for the way she supported me in that moment.

i feel sad that my 8 month streak was broken. i broke a 10 month streak almost to the date last october as well. both of these times my reasoning was to “check in” and see how i feel about consuming again. i think that this is my final check in. i was shaking profusely until i fell asleep, my heart was beating out of my chest, and while there was one point where i felt the good feeling that reminded me why i smoked in the first place, it just isn’t worth it. 

i don’t regret it- i’d been considering smoking for the past couple of months. i think it was inevitable that i’d try it again. the last time i quit wasn’t with a definitive feeling of never wanting to come back. this time it is. i think i needed this experience to kick it for good. i still feel bad, but i’m glad i had this learning experience.",45,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4982104}"

I have been struggling a lot with emotions. My friends all smoke and when we hangout we usually only smoke as something to do. I’m worried that they won’t want to hangout with me as much now that I stopped which is a big trigger for me.

Here is what I have to say,"I apologize in advance if my writing is poor, or if my grammar is bad. I spent some time editing and tried my best. Anyways here we go: 
Today I am 2 months weed free.
      The first few weeks was rough- mentally, and physically. There were days I felt horrible, miserable, alone. I also couldn’t sleep at all, I was up every hour with cold sweats, shivering, nightmares, and panic attacks. I also couldn’t eat at all-I would always get sick and throw up right after.  
        
       I still have these some of these symptoms but as time goes on the symptoms weaken and I am able to learn from these experiences and control my emotions.
        
       When I used to smoke, I would sit in my room and get high all day, smoking every hour, from the exact second I woke up- to the exact second I layed down to sleep.  I lost most of my friends because I chose to stay home and get high. I’ve missed opportunities to go out and meet new people, I’ve missed opportunities to learn new things and I messed around in school, which is why I am still in school when I could’ve been done 2 years ago had I stayed focused. 
         
       Now after quitting, just in those 2 months I’ve noticed a great deal of changes. I take better care of myself both mentally and physically. My lungs feel a lot cleaner. No more phlegm and wheezy breaths. I eat a lot healthier. I’m finally gaining weight and looking more healthier instead of looking so malnourished. I’m able to dedicate my time to the things I love whether it’s being outside or being with family. I’m chasing opportunities-instead of waiting for an opportunity. I’m saving a lot of the money that I would just spend to smoke. I’m able to actually have full,vivid dreams again which I haven’t had in forever, and I can remember the dreams when I wake up. I have a lot more energy to do things, instead of feeling so lazy.
           
       Becoming clean is all a journey, and if you’re struggling to- don’t worry. The first step is admitting to yourself that you have a problem-there is no shame in that, and if you can I applaud you.  The second step is making an attempt to break that habit. It took me several times to quit cold turkey, and stick to it.  I became sick of who I was and I eventually had enough of wasting my time and my money since I smoked throughout all of my teen years from 13-19. I got rid of all my bongs, my pipes and my papers, and started this journey. I began spending my extra free time at the gym working out to help sweat out the toxins and spent a lot of time in nature hiking, hunting, fishing. 
     
       It’s all bout how bad you want it, and I really wanted to change.  Now that I’m 2 months smoke free, there is no looking back, and I am proud of myself.   If anyone is struggling with addiction or withdrawals remember that these feelings won’t last forever. Everyone has their good days and bad days if they are sober or not, so don’t beat yourself up over it. If you can pull yourself through it you won’t regret it. 
       
       People say that weed isn’t an addictive drug that isn’t harmful, but if it can be used it can be abused. I believe weed has good benefits when used in strict moderation and for medical purposes. I have nothing against weed and people who smoke-I know a lot of people who smoke and they are still great people, everyone is different when it comes to addiction, and I am in no position to judge anybody.",29,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40159807}"

The feeling of relaxation and being able to turn my brain off was exactly what I had been after. But of course up went my tolerance, I was smoking up to 4 grams a day at the peak of it.

Hi everyone!  It's my first time posting and I'm so glad to have found this community.  I've been a daily smoker since 2018.  I enjoy it, but smoking for me has been more about self-medicating than anything.  I was in an abusive relationship that I was finally free from about a year ago and, since then, I have found that I am sort of ""waking up"" to my life again, and interested in giving up this habit that's not serving me anymore.

I decided it was time and, about a week ago, drastically cut my weed intake.  I usually smoked 1-3 joints per day, and for the last week I've been smoking a comparatively tiny amoung, 3-5 drags per day.  Today I'm beginning to not smoke at all.

For me, the worst symptom is the nausea.  I am prone to having a pukey stomach anyway, especially in the morning (Crohn's runs in my fam), and the last week has been no joke.  I wake up before my alarm with my guts in knots.  I've been having diarrhea, and nausea so bad that I often puke and can't keep much down until late in the day.  Luckily, I have found that meclizine (otc less-drowsy dramamine) is pretty effective for my nausea, and have been taking it some days to keep from losing the whole day to nausea and GI upset.  I don't want to have to keep taking it every day though, for too long.

Have others experienced bad nausea with quitting?  Or have you had your existing GI issues worsened by quitting?  How long did it take you to get 'out of the woods', so to speak?  I'd be glad to hear anyone's experience or advice.

I started smoking weed at 20 years old, and continued daily throughout college. Through this time period I would only hang out with a few other stoner friends and missed out on a lot of socializing. I told myself I would quit once I graduated. After all, I would be getting a real job that drug tests so I would have to right? Wrong. I quit for about a month just long enough to pass the test, but then I continued smoking.

I continued working as an engineer while smoking daily, but was never high at work. Basically any time I wasn't at work I was high. The bad part was I hid it from my family which ultimately meant being distant. I hid it from them because drugs were never around growing up and I didn't want them to think less of me. If my mom called and I was high I wouldn't answer. I would rarely talk to or hangout with my sister. I would avoid social gatherings if I was high. To this day I never opened up to my family about my smoking. 

Eventually I found myself at a job I hated which made me extremely depressed and suicidal. I couldn't get a new job because I would have to pass a drug test, but I couldn't bring myself to quit because every night I went home depressed and wanted to numb myself. It was a vicious cycle. I worked up enough willpower to quit for about a month and applied for jobs. I interviewed and got a new job, but FAILED the drug test after 42 DAYS CLEAN! This was my first real consequence from smoking weed. I stayed strong and stayed sober and finally landed a new job that I liked.

I stayed off weed for another couple of months but eventually I started getting these thoughts of just missing it. I caved in and bought some, telling myself I'd keep it to weekends only. Yeah, right. That didn't last long. I started smoking daily again, this time with dabs.

Then my wife told me she was pregnant! I always thought to myself that I would raise my kids the way I was raised, with no drugs in the house. I saw first hand how my cousins ended up. Their parents did other worse drugs and as a result, they all ended up as high school drop outs following in their parents footsteps. My family on the other hand had no drugs around and we all became engineers and nurses. So I decided to quit for my son... Later. I'll quit once he's born, I told myself. My son was born 7 months ago and I never stopped. I'm now risking not only my job but my family's only income because I'm an idiot. 

Of course these days I have less time to myself so on the weekends I get up early which is my only alone time. I fucking wake up at 7am on a Saturday and take a few dabs. Yeah I'd say it's safe to say I have a problem. I recently had a talk with my wife about this and we both realize we need to quit. She actually did quit for 2 years but relapsed recently because he was curious to try these new dabs I've been getting. This post is long enough, but to wrap this up basically we've decided to quit together. I just don't know what is going to be different this time to make it stick. I'm feeling a little hopeless right now.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54284805}"

I used to smoke around 2grams a day throughout the entire day. I would take my work lunch breaks by driving home just to smoke and then immediately driving back so I could keep my high up as long as possible.

I realized too late. I had spent roughly $350 a month on this habit, over 12 years, it costs me roughly $50,400 that I could have used on much more important things. (12x12x350=$50,400)

Enough was enough. Got rid of all smoking instruments, smoked the last of what I had, and cold turkeyed my self off it. I knew I was going to have extreme withdrawal... But I pushed through as hard as I could. Often times the urge was unbearable but I had to make the rational choice, I couldn't let myself down, I've tried too many times to quit and always came back to it. I used meditation videos and kept myself distracted with anything I could. Anhedonia hit very hard. After 3 weeks, the worst was behind me, and in about a month my urges were finally gone :)

I never thought I'd see myself sober for 3 months. You can do it!!! I feel as if I've achieved the impossible! I still have MDD though, but that's always been there... And I'm finally begining to come to terms with it.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

As a songwriter and band leader weed is part of my identity in a way. It has been for awhile. All my friends smoke. I’m afraid I won’t be inspired or as creative. 

After not smoking all day I hit the bong at midnight because I couldn’t sleep. Then today while at work on lunch break I broke down and smoked a bowl. Is it even bad? Maybe it’s just a happy mental break?? Maybe I’m a high functioning pothead? Or am I withdrawing and trying to rationalize. Help me please someone tell me, should I quit?

I have definitely felt more emotional, it's like all those feelings I've been numbing with weed are rushing to the surface and it's overwhelming. I'm finding what is helping me succeed is not letting myself have a lot of free time, I'm working out after work, meal prepping, walking the dogs, going out for dinner etc so there isn't much time left to be tempted to smoke. I do find the weekend is ALOT harder, there so much time and I just can't fill it all. The other challenge I'm noticing is my husband is still smoking, which really fucks with my willpower. I have a much easier time when there is no weed in the house, someone's not consistently going outside to smoke, smelling it etc but I have to do this for me. My dreams are getting super intense but I'm sleeping ok so I'm not going to complain.

Warning: Long post.,"Why is it so much harder to commit this time around? I shouldn't be forced to quit in order to find success. My desire to want to quit and be a better me should be enough. And I think it can. But there is much work to be done. Bear with me...

In January I went back to school and the program I entered required me to pass a drug test. I was highly motivated to excel in school, so despite being a 20 year smoker, at least fifteen of those being multiple times daily, I felt like I HAD to quit. So I did. And it was really freaking hard at first. 

I had so many feelings that bubbled to the surface. Happiness, sadness, joy, depression; so many emotions came out to play. I felt as though it was my rite of passage for having lived in a fog for so many years. I endured, and each day, week and eventually month got better. I had 75 glorious days of sobriety. 

As I got through those first tough weeks life began to really clear up and things started happening. Most importantly and almost immediately, I was such a better father and husband. Attentive to my families needs on a whole new level. Everything became about making sure they were content and loved first and foremost. I always considered myself a family man but when I sobered up I realized how much time I wasted, being wasted. Procrastination became obsolete. I worked hard at school and ended up doing very well in my classes and got the certification I was after. I became much more aware of myself. I took better care of my appearance, I worked out diligently, ate healthy, read books, spent more time hiking and camping, built models... So many positive things. I can honestly say I cared about everything so much more passionately. 

Then I decided to celebrate my success with the very substance that had caused me many failures. I'm sure you've all heard this story before. I told myself I never wanted to go back to a full time smoker. I only wanted to indulge in occasion. That first time back wasn't even fun. I was paranoid as hell, sitting in my living room alone getting nervous about every noise I heard outside. And I live in a legal state, which makes it all the more silly. But for some reason, I kept sneaking little tokes here and there and before you know it....

Here I am, back to smoking multiple times daily. The difference is, I don't HAVE two quit, I WANT to quit. I miss the sober me. The go getter. The guy who would belly laugh at the most random things. The guy without bags under his eyes. The guy with tons of energy to play with his kids even after a long day at work and then still hit the gym hard af after they went to bed. I think my wife misses that guy also. (she's not a smoker) She's hinted at it in the most loving and kind ways possible but has never judged or made me feel inferior. 

So this time, even more so than last, it's on me. Nothing is forcing me to do this excerpt the fact I want to be better. And for me, I am better without weed. Thank you to anyone who has read this. Send love and any advice you feel I need to hear. I'm ready to do this for real.",9,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.58284706}"

I’ve been high non-stop for 3 years, constantly smoking, watching stupid stuff on youtube all day. It costed me money, my degree, friends, a girlfriend, and a lot of self-esteem.

But now I’m only 3 days sober and I already see all the potential life has to offer. Now I have to seek dopamine elsewhere, in normal-people activities (still watching youtube haha, but also reading, answering messages, listening music…). It used to be an add-on to being high, now these all are activities by themselves.

I tried to quit maybe 20 times with all kinds of methods and the only thing that has worked for me is this : 

Whenever I’m high and start to get anxiety because of being high and not taking care of responsibilities, I immediately capitalize on this guilt feeling, go the the bathroom, empty my pouches and all grinder residues in the WC then piss on them (very important for the mental image).

1st time : Smoked 6 joints then threw the weed 
2nd time : Smoked 2 joints then threw the weed 
3rd time : Smoked 2 puffs and immediately felt guilty : threw the weed. 

Now, even when I really badly wanna smoke, I don’t even feel like buying cuz I know for a fact I’ll end up throwing it and pissing on it. I’ll lose the money without even getting the high. 

Capitalize on your guilt feeling, don’t let it sink you and make you smoke more to get rid of it. 

I learned a lot thanks to this sub, felt like sharing my story today

It’s 7am, never woke up this early since 2018.

You can do it ! Take your time and find your own, personal way 🙏

I smoked away my hopes and dreams at a critical juncture in my life and I'm strugging with so many aspects of putting my life back together. The regret is unbearable.

I used to have it all and could feel proud of my accomplishments and pursued my dreams. I worked so hard. I had a vision and foresight, a sharp instinct and intuition. I looked into the mirror and loved the guy I saw. Now I hate him. 

It's all gone. I have no self-esteem, hope, family or friends. The damage is so great and unbearable. I don't believe in myself anymore. I feel like such a failure.

I was funny and outgoing, social and had a big network of friends and colleagues. I was motivated and optimistic.

Now my days are numb. I'm mostly non-verbal and shun human connection. I'm estranged from my family and friends. I went from my peak health about 24 months ago to slamming on about 60lbs im 12 months and my body is so stiff I can't enjoy the activities that once brought me joy. I don't take care of any aspect of my daily self-care. I just don't care anymore. 

I'm still slipping downhill despite my 7 months sober.

I'm spend my days ashamed. I'm so angry at myself that I cannot stand to look in the mirror. When I reflect on my mistakes the rage erupts and I want to explode. How could I do this to myself? How could I destroy everything I built?

I am so fucking devasted. I am an athiest who has started looking for God or any hope or inspiration to bring me out of this hell that is my life and relieve me of this hate that I feel towards myself. I haven't found him.

I fucked up so bad and I'm sorry. I don't know how to fix this anymore.

Leaves is my only sanctuary to vent. I needed to get this out. These feelings and this state of mind that I am frozen within is making it feel impossible to feel hope for my future and has been making me feel alot more about weed lately.

My moods are more stable, I'm way more productive (which really isn't saying much, considering I've spent the last 8 years more or less couch-locked), and I'm reading pretty much every day instead of just smoking and zoning out in front of the TV all day. 

I've had multiple people ask me what's up because I seem lighter and just way happier in general. I've told my therapist that it's because I quit smoking all day every day, everybody else I just tell them ""thank you, I feel better than I have in a long time.""

I don't feel like my emotions are completely governed by how much I'm smoking. Now when I'm anxious, there's a reason and it's information to my current situation, rather than ""I just smoked."" And happiness feels different, and doesn't go away when the high wears off.

The last 100 days, I've also dreamt more than I have in the last 8 years. And I've realized that the space I have in my dreams is more valuable to me than the quick dopamine hit I'd get during the day from weed. 

My SO offered me some flower he got that he and his friend raved about, how it was some of the best stuff he's had in years. And I turned it down, and I turned it down easily. While there is, and always will be, a part of me that fantasizes about when it was good, and I do miss those times, there's a bigger part of me that sees everything I've missed for the better part of the decade because I was too high, or I couldn't pass a drug test, or I was running from a part of myself I didn't want to face.

Over the past decade, I would get high and internalize everything I've been through, and try to put a bandaid on the pain it's all caused me. But the last 100 days, I've been thinking about everything I could become. How I could use my trauma to help others. And for once in my life, I feel like the fog is dissipating and my direction is coming in to focus.

I read stories about people chewing on plastic or sensory chew gadgets. This won’t work for me because I hate having things near the back of my mouth. I also grind my teeth and can’t wear a mouth guard (as mentioned above) so chewing on things seems like it’ll ruin my teeth more. What I have been doing is rolling herbs and smoking that when the craving becomes impossible to deal with. I smoke rose petals and lavender (I made sure they were pesticide-free and safe to smoke), but is this only making recovery harder? I’ve tried to quit probably five times this month alone - not using herbs to help the craving. What pushed me to stick with it finally was coughing up discolored phlegm (later realized was just my unbrushed coffee mouth spit) yesterday morning. My hypochondria convinced me I was going into heart failure, had an anxiety attack and realized it’s time to actually just deal with it. I did have COVID for a month (tbh I had no symptoms other than extra back pain when I got my period) so I want to protect my lungs since long-term effects are still unknown. 

I am almost two years alcohol-free and refuse to do any other drug. Last time I quit weed I just replaced it with alcohol. I refused to do that and don’t want to keep replacing one addiction for another. I am the poster child for addiction. 

I do see a therapist and talked with her but didn’t get much help. The usual “just wait it out and use your coping strategies to help.” I’m seeing her for childhood trauma and that’s what she specializes in so she’s not to blame - she’s actually amazing.

I have quit several times in the past the most successful era was back in 2013 when I went back to school and was mostly clean that entire time cumulating in 2015 when I went the entire calendar year with out smoking once. Then I ofcourse graduated school and landed my dream job at the time. Money started coming in quick so I moved out of parents and decided hey I'll celebrate with a little weed. Huge mistake it slowly tuned back into a daily thing. I figured it was ok cuz hey I'm working Monday to Friday and making well above the national average who cares, right?

Well I met a nice lady she was a bit hesitant with my weed use but let it be because well I went to work everyday and only smoked when I was not needed. We got married and now I am expecting our first child. I always told myself I'd go clean when my wife finished her first trimester as I wanted to be  clear headed and present for my child so I can bond properly and of course help with diaper changes and what not.

So here I am day 1 once again after 5 years of daily smoking and what makes it worse this time is that I had the cash for very good weed and in my country its fully legal so I got into concentrates my primary way of partaking was honey oil vape pens. Edibles also weren't uncommon. I believe this is going to make quitting this time extremely difficult but I also have the best reason to quit then I have had in the past, since I'm not just quitting for myself but for my wife and unborn child.

Its been around 4 months since ive smoked weed, and I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience quiting. 

1) I feel a pretty much constant headache/brain fog. Its usually a very minor head ache that is isolated to the front of my head around eyebrow level. Also, after drinking coffee or excercising, the head ache gets much worse. I get suffiecent sleep and I still make myself excercise, but these symptoms seem to not go away. 

2) Sorry for the grossness, but I have constant loose stool. Its never diahrea, but it is consistantly much softer than it has been in the past. I eat healthy, but this seems to have little to no effect on the stool. 

3) I have a consisently high amount of phlegm in my chest and lower espahagus. Excercise makes this worse as well. I have read that this may be my lungs healing after having had constant exposure to smoke for about a year, but I am not sure. 

Lastly, its important to note that Ive seen a few doctors and they say that Im extremely healthy and that these symptoms arent concerning at all. Im just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if the symptoms have gotten better or if this is something that is most likely not going to get better.

The high itself may feel good, and in theory could be used healthily and in moderation, but humans are nautrally drawn to these dopamine surges. 

There are also compound dopamine sources, such as if you use weed to eat, or listen to music, you anticipate the feeling of having both weed and the other dopamine source, so once you quit your mind isn't accustomed to the feeling of eating regularly or listening to music.

I also believe that with enough meditation, one could create a high feeling through their own will, and one could be even happier long term if they just create good habits without that association with weed.",262,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7647273}"

Long story short I went 9 - 10 months with NO WEED. It was actually quite easy. It was only easy because my smoker buddies seemed to drop like the leaves from a tree in the middle of Autumn so effortlessly. But also I got into a strong committed relationship right as I began my sobriety. And she doesn't smoke or do any drugs. She smoked one time and got a whole ass anxiety disorder from it so yea. 

Not exactly sure what else there is to say.  Oh yea! The title! Lol. Last month on the 26th I relapsed! It was so stupid! I got more drunk than I should've. Found my brother's stash. Waited till everyone was asleep. And boom it happened.

It wasn't even a nice experience. Hopefully I'm not breaking any group rules here. It felt like I had to be with myself like a mom to her child or else I would go off the deep end or something like that. Not what I expected to happen at all.

Idk. I wasn't ever really keeping track of my sobriety. Just been busy with relationship and looking for jobs. It happened out of nowhere. And yea me AND my gf felt horrible after it cuz I disappointed her like crazy. 

Not sure where this post is going. I just hope I don't relapse again. I don't want to. Weed is quite useless in the grand scheme of life and the pursuit of ACTUAL INNER happiness. I started out smoking because my friend wanted me to try it. Then I adopted this idea that I could ""explore different states of consciousness"" and that plus peer pressure/ group think kept me in the cycle for like 3 or 4 years. 

It was only until repeated attempts to distance myself from smoking , I was able to see why I even started in the first place. I realized I never even really needed it like ever. 

And so yea idk my relapse was a combination of ""curiousity killed the cat"" and me just wanting validation for struggling in life in general. Keeping up a relationship while looking for a job while losing motivation for your favorite hobby is TOUGH. 

I feel like the future is bright though. This time I'm gonna make it to a year. And more. And then some.

Also, it just seems impossible. What do I actually do every day? I found that I repeat something to myself every day, it stops having any meaning - it’s just something I ‘recite’.

 Weed helped me a lot in my life to deal with cPTSD, war, insecurity, poverty, feelings of shame, guild and abandonment. It literally saved my life. I was self-medicating myself to be able to deal with the stress, emotional flashbacks and emotional dysregulation which were making havoc of my emotions and life. But, old mechanisms and habits are not serving my new me. I am in therapy for a year and half, but since the focus of the therapy was shifted to cPTSD a few months ago, my life started to change big time. And now i realise that weed is standing in the way of my healing journey. 
So, the day has come. After 18 years of smoking weed to help myself deal with my traumatic childhood and adolescence i made a final decision to stop. I was tapering down for months, as i was scared to go cold turkey. I also accept the possibility of relapse, but i will try not to see it something bad and i won't be hard on myself. I will see it as a blip and nothing else. This decision feels so weird.

I started using in college with friends, at first it was fun, after a while it became a necessity. For a long time I thought it was part of me, I loved the highs, or so I thought. I thought my mind was so sharp while I was using. I started having this feeling the conversations with my peers are somewhat lacking. I neglected and lost most of my friends, started living off my flat, just with my stoned thoughts keeping me company.. Then I didn't even like the highs anymore, I just hated being sober and I hated doing anything besides rolling another joint and mindlessly binging youtube.. and somehow I STILL DID NOT SEE WEED WAS A PROBLEM! 

Few months ago I noticed I keep forgetting words. I cannot even have a proper conversation if i wanted to, everything that I can think of seems so shallow. As if my mind was blank. As if couldn't even think anymore. Then it somehow occurred to me it might be because of weed.

I quit 3 weeks ago. Things got noticeably better. I'm not all right by any means, my mind is still so foggy... but in the last week I've got more shit done than in the past two years combined (don't get me wrong, I didn't do much, but I did at least something). And I've had like 2 really vivid dreams, which means a lot to me, as I haven't had a dream in.. well, I don't remember.

I got through my first weeks only thanks to this community, thanks to you, guys. I've read a lot of your posts. Every time I had a craving, every time I thought I'd buy myself just a gram, I've opened up r/leaves and I read your stories, your struggles.. You've kept me off weed so far.

It came about mostly because I was sick of being so secretive about it (not legal in my location), my gf was worried I was doing it too much, and it was getting expensive (dealer upped his prices a fair bit over lockdown).

I was fairly worried about withdrawal symptoms after reading others experiences quitting on here but didn't really get any negative ones apart from lack of appetite.
The appetite thing however has been an issue my whole life and one of the reasons I started smoking in the first place. I am underweight and get serious nausea whenever eating almost anything and have done since ~16 (way before I ever smoked anything), seeing the doctor has resulted in negative allergy (blood) and inflammation (stool) tests. I found weed and discovered I could finally eat and enjoy food and ultimately became somewhat dependant on that fact, eating 1 small meal during the day, then smoking to eat a largeish meal + snacks in the evening. But now I have stopped smoking eating has once again become a chore, I don't actually throw up from eating so I force myself to have 2 meals a day but it's getting harder and harder to the point that today I stood crying in front of the fridge for 20m before giving up.

This may come down to individual preferences but for those who has successfully quit and are not reliant on weed anymore: was it easier to just cold turkey and not smoke? or is it easier to cut down gradually over time from 3 hits a day to 1 and then to 0 eventually?

Before that I had a 6 month break and then took 1 hit off a joint and had a 3 year set back. Those 3 years were on a completely new level of addiction for me. I had discovered wax pens and I went from smoking 2-3 joints a day to now combing that with hitting my wax pen around the clock every time and everywhere I went, especially since I could get away with using it in doors. 

What held me back was the fact that I knew e withdrawals would be the worst I’d ever had to deal with since I was high from the point my eyes opened in the morning until they closed at night. 

I have a health problem called hyperhydrosis that causes me to sweat excessively. I’ve visited various dermatologist over the years just to be told the great news that my case is the worst they had ever seen. Tried various remedies, including Botox injections and nothing worked. I decided to turn to weed as a result as it would decrease my sweating significantly. However after a while it only made it worse unless I was always high. 

The first 17 days were absolutely hellish. I have special undershirts that trap sweat so my shirt doesn’t show stains and I was going through 5-6 of them a day and 4-5 pairs of boxers. Waking up every night no less than 5 times covered in sweat, just staring into darkness and unable to fall back to sleep for a long time. 

On day 18 it’s like some switch was magically flipped, I’m now at 2-3 under shirts a day and 2 boxers max. I’ve also been sleeping much better only waking up twice or so and falling back to sleep quickly. This is still a lot but for me that’s some insane progress.

Thank God I have such a supportive boyfriend and friends and I was able to get into a functional mind set after chugging some water and finished the session.

This experience had me totally shaken and weed just isn't worth this anxiety. I NEED to quit for my own fucking sanity, but goddammit it's hard. I KNOW life will be fine without weed, I KNOW I won't be missing out on anything if I don't get high. So why the fuck do I keep going back to it?

So for one week go to bed at like 1am and get up at 7 30am. That's 6.5 hours in bed. 
Do not go to bed anytime before. Do not get out of bed anytime later. (Set the alarm and force yourself out of bed no matter what and how shit you feel)
Regardless of whether you get a goods night sleep or not. Let's face it you won't and that's why your doing this because you wouldn't anyway and normally you would just be tossing and turning and suffering more sleep anxiety anyway which just makes it harder to sleep. By day 3 you will be so tired, so sleep deprived and built up sleep pressure. you will sleep on the 3rd or 4th night.
It helps if you don't have to work. If you do have to work ajust the hours to fit that 6.5 in bed only to suit your lifestyle.
No daytime naps allowed. 
After a week if you are sleeping better you can add half and hour. After another week if you are sleeping add another half an hour.
I am seeing a sleep specialist and this is the greatest method ever found to help people with insomnia of all kinds. Medication is not the answer and weed is just another self medication for sleep. 
All substance used for sleep like hypnotics or weed and alchohol are not real sleep.

After a year being sober I relapsed about two months ago and have been struggling to quit unsuccessfully since. 

Why did I relapse?

I just couldn’t stand the pressure that has built up. 

Initially, after withdrawal was long behind me,  almost the whole year — and throughout the most of the pandemic — I felt so over it. I felt no craving, I just didn’t think about it for months.

Until I did. I was supposed to travel after a long break and visit my family and friends in my hometown. I knew I would be with people I am never with without the weed.

So about a month or two beforehand, I started having an occasional thought. Which gradually became more frequent and strong. I was talking through it with my therapist and was better but still was feeling the build up. 

I was taking a break from alcohol too until before the trip. I still remember one time when I had a beer how I was gripped by a strong urge to smoke. I started planning: I decided to do it without letting anyone know, and almost had done it.

This went on for two months. During the trip I actually didn’t smoke but started drinking more. By the end of the vacation I was having something to drink almost on a daily basis. 

By the time we were back home, I was just looking for an excuse to smoke.

And so I did. And it immediately gripped me with steal hands and I’m struggling to quit for two months now.

There was NOTHING positive about it. Unlike the last time when I was in denial, it’s overwhelmingly clear to me that smoking is bad for me in many ways:

- The sneaking - this is the worst. 
- The total lack of control over myself. 
- I do bad shit.
- I’m not there for my family. I start treating them as obstacles to get high. I get annoyed. It’s hard for me to concentrate on what my wife is actually saying to me.
- I started eating too much and gaining weight
- After taking a break for a fee days, I started having sleep problems
- I think I am fun and creative but I’m often the opposite
- Smoking always leads to respiratory problems and I don’t dare to start hitting edibles again

I could go on. 

Yesterday  I suffered through a bad weed hangover. Thinking, I will break for a week. When I was through the worst of it, almost recovered, I went down to the weed club and smoked up. It felt like someone was controlling me. It didn’t even feel like a decision. 

The inner dialogue went something like: ‘Look, you’ve been smoking for more than a week each day and you are likely to sleep bad when you quit. Don't quit on a Saturday because you will start your week without sleep. Anyhow, it’s easier to start on Monday. You will go through the hangover more easy on a Monday because you will be distracted by work’
I felt like a zombie. After the whole day if resisting and almost getting through- I walked out of the house and headed straight to the club. 

I feel disgusted… but I know that feeling like this will not help.

I want to treat this as a learning opportunity. And to try to dust myself off and try again. That’s why I am writing this. To try and get some support. 

And there was a small win yesterday. 

I only bought a gram, smoked some in the club and  rolled up a fat joint for today. On the way home, still stoned out of my mind on a bike I realized just how powerless I feel over it. 

So I stopped the bike and did a very difficult thing. I took the fat joint of blueberry smelling Indica, and with a huge effort, threw it down the sewer. 

A small win. I feel ready to commit to a bigger one now:

- 8 days of no weed
- Prioritize sleep
- Stay active
- Be careful about planning your week. I will be more prone to stress, and need to compansate for that. 

I am not taking a t-break, I want to quit for good. But this is all I am able to commit to now.

Any words of encouragement or insight will be appreciated!

I started in the 7th grade, weed and computer shenanigans were my only major comforts during childhood. My parents mostly beat me, yelled at me, or ignored me. I started smoking weed because I goy the idea in my head(probably from my burnout Father) that it would make me cool.

It didnt, and the ""coolest"" I ever was was probably for the couple years I wasnt smoking, when I was in the military.

Military wasnt the best fit for me, I had problems that I couldnt overcome that stemmed from aforementioned childhood stuff. I got home, was homeless for a couple months (after coming home and realizing how shitty my parents treated me....worse than when I was in the military. Shame I didng realize it sooner), then got an apartment with gi bill and was ready to take on the world.

Then covid hit. And I was locked in my room again. Just like when I was a kid. And I started smoking again, late 2019 or early 2020.

Now its almost 2022 and Ive realized Ive done a whole bunch of nothing since I got out. I have a shitty minimum wage job and go to school and get shit grades, and then I go home and waste my time smoking and sitting in front of a computer.

Before the military, I though that joining would somehow make me whole, give me what I was missing, make me a ""man"". I lost 160lbs chasing that lie, only to come out the other end in a tailspin when I finally realized theres no single thing thats going to make me any better. Now Im almost as fat as I used to be, Im addicted to weed again, and it's even worse because this time I can actually remember a time when I WASNT like this. And I just feel so powerless to change.

Night 2 I still didn’t sleep well despite not sleeping the night before. Didn’t doze off until around 3am, and last night I didn’t fall asleep until 5am.

I keep reminding myself that no matter what, eventually I will have to go through this and I feel it is better to get rid of my habit sooner than later. I was in denial about how weed has held me back in the past but I think I have finally had enough of lying to myself. The only pro for me with weed at this point is that it keeps me from falling into depression, but I can’t help but think depression wouldn’t even be an issue, had I not started smoking so much in the first place.

3 months ago, I came up with a huge anxiety that I might have been actually addicted to weed. I kept wanted to quit but that was not easy to do. However, 3 days ago, I don't know why, but I just thought it was the day I would go cold turkey  and I did.

Before I decided to go cold turkey, I was actually scared of withdrawl symptoms which I thought I would be weak and lose to those symptoms. However, for withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, anxiety and depression is managable so far and I already feel positive about how things are looking way more clear(I missed this). However I only slept total of 4 hours. Yea.....4 hours out of 72 hours and it wasn't even a night time sleep. I couldn't sleep at all for the first day, had 4 hours of nap(?) 2nd day and couldn't sleep again, and I am still up from last night. I tried cold shower, exercise, meditation, 478 breathing, cleaning the bedroom, etc. None of those helped me. When I closed my eyes I could feel the sleep is coming to me. But heck no, right before when sleep reaches me, it just disappears. This happened more then 10 times which it feels like my body is resisting to sleep. It is not even funny how my body and brain is keep signalling me they are tired but resists sleep.

I was against all drugs and alcohol at the time because my bio-dad had died from a overdose at age 32. I was 11 and already living with my aunt and uncle. My sister (cousin), convinced me to try another drug, she kept making ""jokes"" about one day slipping a pill into my drink to try it, so I stupidly thought to get ahead of that by agreeing to do it.
   She invited her brother in law, my now husband, and that's how it started. I figured after the harder drug,  weed wasn't as bad and I spiraled from there. 
Eventually got off all the other drugs except weed, got married,  started a family. We now have 2 boys ages 5 and 10.
  I've been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. I discovered have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I changed my entire diet. Haven't had an egg yolk in months. I have stock in Mrs Dash. I don't eat pork or beef and rarely even chicken.
   My psychiatrist and primary care doctor both told me I need to stop smoking bc of prescriptions I'm on and I did for 4 months. I also gave up drinking... then I relapsed.  
   The quit drinking was easier for me. I play pretend a lot with pomegranate juice or nitro coffee in a glass etc...  And, A LOT  of tea. So much hot tea.... 
   My last relapse came when my husband harvested his plants (its legal where I live), and encouraged me to try some. Suddenly was back on the ride, smoking bong hits every chance I could and feeling horrible about myself.       
   My 10 year old had DARE at school and asked my husband if he's addicted to drinking (he's a heavy drinker). That was a wake up call for me. We need at least one  sober parent in the house for my kids. 
   Finally October 11, I resisted the urge to go out to the shed when he told me ""there's  a wake and bake out there for you"". I told him today is the day I'm quitting.  He said,  nevermind, that's my bong hit, so don't smoke it. He's trying in his way to be supportive. I downloaded a stop smoking weed app, joined this reddit group, texted my talk therapist for an appointment all on the same day. 
   Last week I started reaching out to old friends to try to build my support system.  The first day was hell. I almost gave in so many times. This group and your stories helped so much, so thank you. 
   I smell weed in my house all day, because he's either coming in from smoking or drying out his harvest in the basement.  He finally finished trimming it all, put it in containers, and says the smell should start fading. God I hope so. 
   Before it was easier because when we're buying, eventually we'd run out and that's when I'd quit, but now I realize it's always going to be around. My craving is there, but not as bad as day 1. It's not just for the kids, not just for ""my health"" , it's for ME this time if that makes any sense. I need to stay sober for ALL the reasons. It's so hard. 
   Thank you for letting me vent.... does anyone have advice on how to stay sober in a house where weed is always around? Trying to stay strong here.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49486974}"

- Saving money

I have joined this group to share experiences with you people and maybe give each other advice to achieve quitting weed. 

So some advice from me to anyone who needs it;
- Use the Quit Weed app, it shows you how long you haven't smoked weed, the amount of money it has saved you and the health benefits.
- Tell people around you that you're quitting. This can be scary, but telling other people will make you feel less alone. (At least it did for me)

I only remember the day because it’s the day after my moms birthday. I ran out of weed that day, and had been thinking about a serious life change for almost 3 years before it happened. I was in a phase where I get stoned, and then think about wanting to quit, often thinking about how my life might be different while stoned in the shower. I remember a post here that profoundly impacted my decision. Someone posted a comment about imagining a character of your weed smoking self. This character is the embodiment of who you think you’d turn into in the future if you kept smoking on the path you’re on. For me it was easy to imagine what path I might fall into, because the path for the last 10 years had been pretty predictable. Wake up and roast 3-4 snaps, go to work and hit the pen periodically, get home and immediately smoke 3-4 snaps before showering and chilling for the evening. Likely, 2-6 more rips between chilling and bedtime. This was the life, and arguably I achieved a lot in life in those 10 years. I was a functional stoner in all its glory, but always high. I knew there was more to life out there so when I ran out that day, after years of thinking about it I knew I was ready. I still think about smoking from time to time, but I have accomplished so much since quitting that I’ll never go back. I am proud of myself for making the change. I won’t claim to be sober, and perhaps drinking will be next in a few years, but making positive changes comes in waves for me. No weaning but cold turkey. It might be harder but I was ready.

So I'm 25 and have been smoking daily for the past 5 years or so. I have quite a severe stammer and ADHD, which makes me somewhat of an anxious person to say the least. I have always thought weed that weed was helping me with that but I'm starting to realise that it really isn't.. 

I'm doing my thesis research now and things have been so damn stressful with covid making everything 10x harder that I've fallen into the habit of 'smoking my stress away' I guess. This has made me absolutely miserable the past few months and I've finally come to the realisation that the weed (or hasj in my case) isn't helping me at all to cope with my stress, but only numbs all my feelings and is making me even more stressed because I've trouble planning stuff.

I didn't smoke for 5 days last week and it was amazing how much happier I felt and less anxious. I even had a conversation with 2 strangers, which may sound irrelevant to most of you, but it is a big deal to me. My stammer makes these things quit scary and I usually avoid it. But last week I felt so much less anti-social. It's kinda like I've seen a glimpse of the person I wish I could be and now I know I can be. 

But yeah.. I still got high yesterday.. I had a really stressful day and averted a small crisis in my research. When I got home my roommate was smoking a J and I decided to 'reward' myself with getting high, but it totally sucked. It didn't make me happy at all for some reason. To be honest, I'm really disappointed in myself but at the same time I don't want to be too hard on myself, 'cause from experience I know that is only going to lead me to relapse again. 

So yeah, starting over today I guess. I know I really want to quit now, which is new, cause I didn't really feel that way in the past when I tried to quit. This subreddit also really helps, so thank you guys. I'm hopeful I'm going to get to the 7 day mark now. I think I just have to be a bit more aware of my triggers I guess? How do I prevent this from happening again? Even though I don't think it is going to happen again, I also kinda feel like I can't trust myself sometimes.

I have let getting high control my life to the point that ive skipped many many experiences because i couldnt get high if id done that so i just never did anything that would prevemt me from getting high. I was vacate for a huge chunk of my marriage and was barely a person and i still am barely a person. I have such a hard time connecting with things or expressing myself as a result and i have realized that for all the benefits cannabis has brought my over the years - less depression and better sleeping, no nightmares, more of an appetite, reliving my back pain all of that has been such a small result of me being high all the time and i would focus on those tiny things and be well this is good. It helps me in all these ways, and i refused to look on the other side at what detrimental damage it was doing to my life and relationships.
I have now accepted that i can no longer get high for the foreseeable future. I have used cannabis as a crutch for any issue ive ever had and now i understand that im not a functionable human being.

2021-10-23 00:51:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qdy3wr/this_changed_my_life/,This changed my life,"So, I made a post here roughly 2 years ago that is one of the top posts of all time on this sub-reddit, which you can go read under top if you wish, I think it's number 50 on the top section.

Since then I have come a long way and learned A LOT. I still stand 100% by what I said in that original post, but it was only part of the puzzle of my quitting journey.

Unfortunately, about 6 months after that I fell into the illusion that we all seem to fall for which is, I'm only going to take one hit.. What's the worst that could happen right? I have 6 months sober under my belt, there's no way this one hit would throw me back into the depths of weed addiction, right??? No of course not, I can handle it, I've changed, right????????

WRONG!!

Just one hit sent me back into the thralls of addiction, rationalizing my weed use at every turn, getting high and wanting to quit, and then being sober and wanting to use, a vicious cycle.

I realized these were all lies that my brain told me because the brain doesn't have context, it only see's things in 1's and 0's (dopamine or no dopamine). Now a days in civil society we can get instant hits of dopamine in plentiful amounts and on demand, however back when we were hunter gatherers dopamine was used to help us to survive, to motivate us to hunt, build shelters, and sexually reproduce.

I realized weed was constantly flooding my brain with dopamine,  and that my brain didn't see the logical consequences of abusing weed. It gave me that hit of dopamine and made me think that it was helping me in life or to survive in some way. This is why sometimes I was so frustrated because I logically knew weed was no good for me, but still continued to abuse it.

So the first step that helped me immensely with quitting was to see that I am not my thoughts, but the awareness of my thoughts. I realized I had the ability to observe my thoughts that are saying things like, just take one hit, it won't hurt just one time, and realized that I could just let them pass through without taking action on them. 

The problem I think, is most people in society are completely identified with their minds, they believe that their thoughts are them and believe what the thoughts say. So when the thoughts say, we need that hit, or something unrelated to weed like, what if she leaves you and breaks your heart, we may commonly become identified with these thoughts and believe them to be true. However, what I learned is all the thoughts I am having are just based on past conditioning. What I realized was thoughts are just words in my head and I am the awareness of them. I realized awareness was the first step to true transformation and change for me because I couldn't change something that I was not aware of. I always had certain types of thought patterns playing throughout my life that kept me in bondage with weed that I kept falling victim to because I falsely believed in these thoughts and what they were saying, but I realized that these thoughts were my false self and that my true self was awareness (this is the essence of meditation). The thoughts happen within awareness, and they come and go, I don't come and go with my thoughts, so how could I be my thoughts?

I began to ask myself the question, who am I? Who am I behind all these thought patterns, beliefs, memories, labels and judgements? And I realized that the answer was ""I"" am pure awareness who notices all these things. The problem is that the awareness gets lost in all of this stuff and drama and forgets itself, it becomes overlooked (it did for me)

There is another hidden underlying reason that I, and I think maybe a lot of us here use weed which I'm going to try to lay out very clearly here.

I was using weed to escape my painful emotions, feelings and negative thought patterns.

Instead of processing the emotions, I was using weed as a distraction, an escape to blanket my emotions so I didn't have to feel them, but what this does is it shoves the emotions and feelings down inside of us and suppresses them.

No one ever told me this in life and it isn't commonly talked about and is also counter-intuitive, but it's changed my life more then anything else. This is that I needed to process my feelings to have them go away and that to get rid of these feelings I needed to FEEL THEM. When I say feel them I mean when that painful emotion arises in my belly area or chest and then I just have to sit with that emotion, observe it and let it be exactly what it wants to be. Not trying to run, distract, escape, or suppress, but letting it be.

These feelings are simply trying to move through me and leave, but I would shove them down there because they are uncomfortable and painful, and when I escaped them they only got buried deep inside of me and created an extremely terrible state of stress, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, fear, guilt, shame, the list goes on and on. 

I was actually diagnosed by the doctor with anxiety disorder and was told I'd be on meds for the rest of my life and after doing this internal work I have literally ZERO anxiety

If your anything like me or the average human being, you may have been trying to escape and suppress these emotions your entire life. I know in my case I had a ton of garbage buried down there that needed to come up into the light of my awareness to be dissolved by sitting with it

Weed is just another mechanism of escape, but I gained freedom in myself and in life when I let whatever painful emotions come up to be felt fully in a fearless awareness, I was and am no longer at war with myself and resisting the way things are which is that these feelings exist.

Don't get me wrong, this wasn't an easy process and it took a long ass time to let these feelings come up and process them, because it took me a long ass time to stuff them all down there, so by no means is this process easy, it was and still is painful and uncomfortable but I realized it's the path to true freedom, happiness, and the key to overcoming addictions of all kinds.

One more very important thing, is that when I quit weed, It was important for me not see it as a sacrifice, but to see it as a blessing. I needed to ask myself honestly, what is this really doing for me? If I was honest with myself I realized I was brainwashed into thinking weed provided me some sort of benefit in life, but it couldn't be further from the truth. I Remind myself everyday of all the negative and painful problems with weed and all the amazing and pleasurable benefits I am getting from quitting.

Also it was important for me when going through withdrawal, to remember that it isn't the real me and it will improve, those feelings of depression and hopelessness in the beginning of quitting would drive me to want to use again, but what's helped me is reminding myself that those feelings are there because I abused weed so much and temporarily fried my neurotransmitters, so going back to the thing that harmed me isn't going to help.

I went cold turkey officially one month ago and it sucked. I dont believe i was addicted due to the lack of cravings when I stopped smoking but there were defininitley withdrawal symptoms. But thats not very relevant. Whats important is why I quit.

&#x200B;

Bit of background about me Im 17 and from Newzealand where pot is used heavily tho still illegal. My first experience with Weed came when i was 15. A friend invited me to try it out of his plastic hose bong. He was a great person to smoke with for a first timer. Gave me enough to truly feel the effects and was there to help me navigate this new feeling. It was awesome plain and simple. I didn't smoke weed again until about a year later. After finding my own dealer who sold me weed for a good price. I too smoked out of a Plastic hose bong kiwi style with my mates until one day I came into my room and there was a wooden pipe just sitting there on my desk. With a note 'If you're going to do it do it right'. This gift and note was from my older brother as a gift. I was surprised because at that point we weren't very close he being 5 years older than me. But I took my new pipe and started using it, It was definitely a learning curve for our lung tolerance but we adjusted. 

&#x200B;

And all it was at that point was just me and my friends having innocent fun in the bush smoking weed and around the neighborhood creating memories I will carry for the rest of my Life. And for the next year thats all it was. I smoked infrequently with my mates to have fun.

&#x200B;

About 4 Months ago Though I had Found a consistent supply of high quality weed and me and my friends smoking increased considerably. Always sneaking off to our spot near the beach in the bush. Gorgeous view. And still one of my favorite places today. At work I had heard of a store that sold Bongs, Pipes, Papers etc. To teenagers that dont ask For I.D . Sale of these products to people under the age of 18 is illegal in Newzealand so finding a store willing to sell Was Music to my ears. I believe they found a loophole in the Law Where because they were tecnically a gift shop not a Smoke shop they didnt require people to I.D and Sold their Bongs as 'vases'. I purchased a simple Glass bong for $70NZD.

We loved this Bong. I tell you it was a amazing transition from A rough wooden pipe to a glass Bong. And while my friends came over and used it I owned it and Thats when I started Smoking alone..

In my room my dad had no Idea. It was fun but a pattern quickly started. And it got worse. Recently I had Gone through A breakup, My first love and While not depressed I wasn't in the Best state of mind. I was also Going through Other Personal Things. But however I never Used Pot To escape from My feelings Just to relax and would Often Openly think about and Productively reflect while High. When I damaged The glass Bong I thought To replace it So I went to the Store And brought A gorgeous $110NZD Bong it was massive and hit like nothing I had ever Smoked. 

&#x200B;

And Just a few days over a Month Ago I decided It needed to stop. I sat there in My couch Thinking about My Current Situation When it came to using Pot, I looked at my smaller Cheaper Bong then To my massive Expensive one. Was this a sign? I thought, A physical Symbol of Excess. I had realized that When I started Smoking I had done for all the right reasons, And Now I was not.. I Decided Right then and there it was Over. In two 3 Days its Over. 11:59pm it was over. I prepared and planed and enjoyed Smoking Over those Two days until It came to my Final Night.

&#x200B;

The Night before I had grinded up all my remaining pot And Put it in a bag to store and cleaned The grinder Perfectly. Tonight was the Night. I cleaned My glass Bong Perfectly And sat down On the couch In my Room. And Had A great Night. I laughed at the TV (Keeping up with the Karadasians was my favorite high). I had cool and fun ideas and then I looked In the bag. One cone left. I packed it tight doused it in Keif. An absolute Monster of a Cone. One Hit sunk it. I was Never that high In my life. After I came down A bit I wrote Myself a Note Explaining how I felt How I got here and Why it needed too stop. I Put the exact Time and date on That note and I went downstairs. I spent An hour cleaning My bong to Better Than brand New definitely excessive. After Drying I put The note inside. And Wrapped It up until I could No longer see it. I went Upstairs And put It in my Closet to sit. I promised myself the next Time I smoke (If I decided too) Will be From that Bong. Until The day I can Smoke for all the Right reasons Again. It just Sits there waiting..

I hate that I smoke weed to help me with depression and bipolar 
I hate that because of the cannabis use, I got dependent on it to resolve my issues 
I hate that I don’t have a job and I have been applying, I hate that all the people I knew as friends have jobs now and don’t wanna talk to me. I hate the way my life is. 

I can’t sleep at night unless I smoke 
I used to think a joint once in a while was okay till it became an every day thing and even now.. I think it’s okay but it’s really not.  
I feel like a disappointment to my parents, I let my dad down and all he did was raise me with proper financial support. I’m not grateful enough to work hard and become something of myself. I’m just being greedy and getting all the fun I can by getting high and not being responsible. This is the most honest I’ve been with myself. I can’t even look at my dad anymore, I just feel like a let down. He worked since he was 4, came from a diff country, still works all day comes home to watch news, pray then repeat. I wake up, go smoke, come home apply once and act like I did something and think of ways to sneak out to smoke. I Fucking need a job and I need to become the best version of myself but I’m so desperate. I haven’t accomplished any of my goals I made over and over for the past few years. Nothing. I’m 26 and I really don’t think I can do it. I’ll wake up and act like I gave effort in the day but all I did is smoke weed and try to focus. 

I don’t know why I wanna die when I wake up or before sleeping. I’m not suicidal but I feel so worthless sometimes. I don’t look forward to anything. I wanna try to stop smoking weed but I just got an ounce and don’t know if I should stop or wait till it finishes/ just like the last time I said that and continued. My ex left me and I was very codependent so now I have no one. My “friends” are busy working their careers and making the best of themselves. My parents tell me they care by telling me if I smoke it’s the equivalent of me peeing on them. They think weed is 100% bad and don’t understand their kid is bipolar and depressed. I don’t wanna be depressed or bipolar, I shouldn’t be. I don’t deserve this. I should be grateful for what I have and not be mentally ill. I was raised and got everything I wanted at the cost of my own mental health. I didn’t care about my mental health till it got this bad and even now I’m struggling to quit. I never worked hard for anything. Or so I feel like. I need to break through, I need to go to the next step and get out of this.

And that's the official one, even counting all of the relapses I had during the first couple of months of quitting. It's really crazy to think that 6 months ago, or 2 years ago, or 7 years ago, I thought it was impossible for me to quit. I've been struggling so much, beating myself up, dealing with paranoia, worrying about my lungs, but not anymore. A couple of months ago I was browsing this sub and looking with envy at the people who posted their 100-day streaks, while I was trying to make it from day 10 to day 11. But now I can say that I did it too. And I didn't even realize it. Day 100 came and went by and I didn't even notice because I stopped counting a long time ago. I think of smoking a joint maybe once a week, but it's never a craving like I used to have, it's more like a thought of ""oh that would be nice"" followed by a thought of ""no it wouldn't be nice at all"". I think I've successfully ruined weed for myself.

Life is still far from perfect, I'm still dealing with a variety of mental/whatever problems, but I'm much better able to deal with it since I'm not spending all my time smoking weed. On the flip side I've started drinking a lot, so that's something I have to deal with (maybe I'll see you in /r/stopdrinking).

I also know that this is when I broke down last time I tried to quit thinking I could handle it if I smoked just once. I made a deal with myself today that I'll go 2 yrs and then make the decision. I figure I should have enough experience by then to have good judgement. Right now I just need to keep going. Keep doing things that are good for me even if i dont like doing them or in this case not doing them.

I was a MJ supporter since I was young and I was wrong.  Missed lots of things and hopefully, it is a reminder for young fellows.

This is my first time sober on my own will for 30 days in Canada.

1. I tried to quit by flying abroad to a country that doesn't allow pot and it didn't work as I back to the old habit once return home.
2. In the past when I tried to withdraw I have to take a pain killer to make me feel better
3. I quit smoking and use pot as a substitute and maybe that was the reason I kept smoking pot for another 5 years... I smoked for 15yrs and pot for 20 years.

The turning point for me was finding out about this subreddit and I read somewhere along the line that:

""You smoke pot because you chasing for that first high but you can't get that feeling ever again, and you just smoke more to chase it...""

So I decided to quit while my partner is still dabbing beside me.

This time just pure will and determination.

1st week:  Lots of headaches, palm and feet sweat. Insomnia.  Feeling tired all the time

2nd week: a little bit better, headache less, still wet palm and feet.

3rd week: insomnia, daily routine mess up as you felt tired all the time. sweat palms still exist

4th week: gum bleed and teeth feel uncomfortable, felt like when I had wisdom teeth and inflammation caused by lack of sleep. Sweaty palms and no headache now. The energy level is back to normal.

&#x200B;

As I look back on this month I should have consumed more water and maybe more veggies.  And a bit of exercise before sleep to help with insomnia.

I am excited for next month and I will keep updating you guys.

Once again thank you all and don't feel discouraged if you failed.  I personally failed 4 times and I can confidently say this I quit for good this time.

If any of you have questions or need support please let me know.

&#x200B;

=====Update edit:=======

just did quick research so I learned a few things and I just realized what Cold turkey is.  (straight out quit)

and understand what PAWS.

I do notice blur vision and I also noticed I don't have diarrhea/stomach pain compared to my previous attempts.

and I have a good appetite I think it has to do with I am on 168 fastings, but I have already been on 168 for 10 months so take that into consideration.

One positive thing is my thought is a lot more clear compared to in the past I can't even typed these much when I am on pot!

2021-10-22 17:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qdqcl7/moments_of_clarity/,Moment[s] of Clarity,"To start off, I’ve been heavily using weed for the better part of 7 years. I was sober up until I turned 20 and was self proclaimed straight edge. Mostly due to bands I liked (not really edge bands, just bands with members who were). I didn’t grow with older siblings that smoked and my parents don’t smoke. But in high school I had a opinion on people that smoked and drank. That was 2009-2013. In 2014 on my 20th birthday I broke sobriety and drank and smoked for the first time in my life. Getting high was the most insane feeling I had ever felt and it’s honestly indescribable. I started smoking on a very regular basis from that point on and instantly started abusing it. I started stealing weed and smoking my girlfriends weed without consent. Going to work high, going to community college high, spending money that I should have invested in myself and mine and my girlfriends life. I’ve gone through so many phases with wanting to stop and falling back into it. I’ve started to realize I was adding so much negativity into my life since smoking weed. From the people I chose to keep around, the lack of foresight, and the constant cycle of self loathing I’ve put myself in with battling my weed use. 
I like that there is this community because for years I’ve talked about this with my friends and I always feel so alone in this battle. Weed is something I don’t necessarily wish I hadn’t tried but I feel like it opened up a door of my personality that I wish stayed closed. 
So here’s to future sobriety. 
I constantly have realizations about my abuse of weed and at this point in my life I need to follow through.

My Fiancé is doing great in his career and is in line for a big promotion too.

We got a new apartment and new car in this time too, along with my Fiance following his dream and getting a motorbike!

When I smoked I geniunely thought these goals were a lifetime away. I read on leaves when I was quitting that weed was a ""time vampire"" which is so damn true.

I haven’t smoked since the above listed time. Before the quit date I tapered down to just a small bowl per night pretty much before bed. I highly recommend trying to taper if you can, it has made my withdrawals much more manageable compared to previous quit attempts. My most memorable was quitting senior year of college after ripping dabs pretty much 3 years straight. 

This time, I have been able to sleep and appetite has been ok, I feel like my body was telling me to quit the past couple months and it is very happy to finally not be high every day. 

One question, I have started to experience almost the inability to control my emotions, I’ve had random outbursts of just breaking down while working and being brought to tears just because someone was a Dick to me at work. Is this normal? I feel like I have been suppressing my emotions for the longest time and it’s just now on overload. Would appreciate any feedback or similar stories. 

Overall just kind of wanted to vent and potentially open up discussion for anyone with similar experiences

I wanted to find a way to quit after numerous failed attempts and I thought finding people going through the same thing as me would be exactly what I needed. I was a University student, my grades were suffering because of weed. I had serious brain fog and no motivation to do anything but smoke. I quit for the final time exactly one year ago and about three days later I suffered a weed induced psychosis. O was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and spent the next three months recovering and detoxing before being discharged. Since then I've been on mood stabilizing medication and the doctors say I run the risk of having another psychotic episode if I ever smoke again. Being in a place where I had no access to weed for 3 months definitely helped me, I had severe cravings, mood swings, insomnia, and nightmares during the first two months and to be honest,  if I wasn't in hospital I dont think I would of made it. Since my discharge, the hardest part was being around my friends who smoke, I had to distance myself. Now 1 year later, I'm more clear headed, no more brain fog or memory loss. I still suffer from depression but I'm learning to cope with it in healthy ways. I can't say quitting weed has cured all my problems but I feel better and I hope to continue my sober lifestyle. I've checked in on this platform from time to time and read so many inspiring stories, I hope this one helps at least one person out there who might be going through the same thing.",46,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44739017}"

I'm making this post more to present my reasons for quitting to myself then anything else.

I've been smoking for a long time, started with a buddy at a new year's party in 2000.  I have always been an introvert and smoking made me part of a group.   

I did quit for a year when training for a job but bounced back into it.  I started having stomach issues and was diagnosed with Crohns.  Weed helped with that but I found myself using it outside of the flare ups.  It's funny as this time it wasn't about finding a group, it was to avoid it.  I stopped looking for friendship, started hating other people and used weed to help justify that being alone was OK and that people were the problem.  I'm still very introverted and honestly my hobbies and such all lean towards that.  I have a very small circle of friends and don't know if I'll ever have a successful relationship.  

The one thing I do l know is I am okay being by myself.  I don't mind being alone.  I also know that there are things in my life I'm not happy with and that I don't want to live with regrets.

I don't want to feel like I need a drug to function.

Here are the reasons I want to quit:

I'm out of shape and lack motivation to improve this when I'm stoned

Being out of shape prevents me from enjoying the hobbies I want to enjoy.  I am big into hunting and fishing.  Fishing isn't as big of a deal when it comes to weed, but hunting is.  I need to up my cardio big time.  I find I pick the easy to access hunting spots because I'm out of shape and lazy.   I've always wanted to do a fly in trip but never have as I feel I'd waste the experience

I've always wanted to learn jiu jitsu and judo but again have avoided this and used weed to accept that it just isn't possible for me

I want to maintain my property better, fix up my house, keep on top of cleaning etc but a this gets pushed aside when I smoke

I want to experience more in this world rather then living in a cloud of smoke with a foggy brain...

And at the same time my brain keeps circling back to ""weed makes you happy and it's enough"" but my hearts telling me ""fuck that, you need to quit and live""

I’ve tried quitting many times and relapsing a lot too, but overall I’ve basically weaned down to smoking once or twice a week, only with others and never alone. 

I feel like shit. I’m more depressed than usual, have no energy or motivation after I get of work to do the things I desperately need to (chores, schedule doctors appts, find an apartment) and my anxiety and frustration is through the roof. My sleep is worse and I still feel so groggy in the morning. I’m trying so hard to stay strong and not use while I’m alone at home but I keep finding myself looking for reasons to relapse. I’m staying strong, for tonight at least, because I know I’ll be full of regret and worse off. But man this sucks. I don’t know when it’s going to start getting better, or if weed was never really the problem to begin with.

Please take a few minutes to read as I'm new to the community.","I was stuck looking for a solution for my severe social anxiety, lower confidence, severely disorganized thinking, and in general, a really fucked brain that I couldn't unfuck.

Now I found the ""NoFap"" community, and things seemed to fall into place. Almost all of my symptoms were listed and seemingly solved by the porn free journey. I haven't smoked/used porn for the last 140 days. This has been alot of time to reflect and think through a few things. A recent realization that I have come to is it probably wasn't the porn. It was the weed.

I didn't even know what anxiety was until I started smoking. It started innocently and just a way to have a fun-filled night downing pizzas and laughing til I cried. However, over time, I started to use more potent shit. Introduced to ""dabs"" and the first time I used that shit, I felt like I was in a fucking cartoon.

Fast forward a few months and dabs were somewhat regular when smoking with my buddy. We'd take 4 or 5 fat dabs in the span of an hour or two. Using the pen became an addiction, I would think about it most of my day until it was socially acceptable to be high at night. 

I've done SO much research on dopamine and the reward system. I am starting to think the weed is where it all went wrong. I was a normal happy 17 year old that didn't even know what anxiety/depression felt like. Now I'm 20 and trying my best to dig myself out of this hole of anxiety and depression.

The worst of it was that I could not function in a romantic relationship. No matter how hard I tried. My brain couldn't think correctly or make even the slightest decisions with any sense of confidence in them. 

I'm doing MUCH better than I was six months ago. But I'm still far from right, I understand it takes a long time for some. I'm currently in a state of emotional and sexual flatline but they are both getting a bit better. 

Please give me some thoughts on what I said and happy to answer any questions. NoFap was (and may still be) the place I needed to be, but here might be more fitting. I've been working out 5x a week, recently switched to a vegan diet, take the necessary vitamins/supplements, and have a regular sleep schedule.




TL;DR - Started off on NoFap and realized that weed may have been my problem, not porn. Just a guy trying to unfuck his brain and get back to feeling like himself.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6414517}"

It's been so hard to quit, I probably relapsed shortly after I posted the above, and it feels like there's never a good time to quit. I'm on vacation right now, and was using very lightly at night to unwind, but getting high doesn't do anything for me anymore, other than make me feel bad about smoking. 

I am healthy in every other aspect of my life -- good job, I work out, I have hobbies, I have a normal healthy relationship (bickering every now and then but that's normal), but I've associated my identity with smoking weed for so long that sometimes when I don't want to smoke, it just feels like I blink, and I have some weed that I'm about to hit.

If I had a dollar for every time I told myself that this was going to be the last time, I'd quite frankly probably have between 400-800 dollars. I'm so okay when I'm sober, and then I think about smoking and the fact that I can't smoke when I think about it, makes me want to smoke even more, and eventually I just cave and then I feel terrible and can only think about one word to describe myself: spineless. Does my word not mean anything?

But I don't want to be this person anymore. I don't want to be a person that can't keep his word, that says things and doesn't do them.

This time being sober is the first time I have committed to never touching weed again, and have no specific plans to relapse. Things that have helped me a great deal.

\- Tapering my usage down with a timer safer and measuring out how much I would use per day, reducing that a bit each day. I understand this may be a controversial strategy, but for me it helped negate most withdrawal effects that would create urges to use again.

\- SMART recovery group twice a week. THIS IS HUGE!! This forum is wonderful, and supplementing it with real time (albeit virtual) interaction with others going through the same problem was a game changer.

\- Exercise every day. Well, almost. Some days my body is wrecked and I need a break. Doesn't matter how much or how little, as long as it is substantial to you is what counts.

\- Building other new habits to replace my old one. Things like nutrition, calorie counting, cleaning, watering my plants, creating to do lists, shopping lists, fun idea lists. Not only do these things keep me busy, they help me enrich my life and bring me joy.

\- As soon as the insomnia was behind me, I started prioritizing good sleeping habits. The rituals of getting ready for bed, consistent bedtime and rise, no scrolling my phone 1 hour prior or after sleep. This is a work in progress, but even if I get a good nights sleep half the time, I find that it greatly increases my mood.

It gave me the validation that I needed and couldn’t find anywhere in my personal life that smoking was really hard to stop. I just felt crazy and continued the cycle of using because no one seemed to understand what I was going through was HARD. This subreddit absolutely changed the game, so if you’re just starting on this journey, know you are in the right place already. 
I was a heavy flower smoker for 5 years, medical card, bong rips, occasional dabs. I had social anxiety, planned my schedule around when I could smoke and be high, and never followed through with plans. I had a hard time articulating my thoughts into words and would lose my train of thought mid sentence all which led me to lose a lot of confidence in myself.
Im very happy to say that all of these things got better for me once I stopped. It quite literally changed my life and the trajectory I was on. I am thankful to have finally put the lighter down and I like to view it as a practice of self love. I love myself enough to treat this body better than I was. 
My advice to those who are just starting your sober journey is to take it a day at a time, know that the first three days are the hardest and most important to get through, be open with those close to you who smoke about what your plan is and how they can support that, get a tracking app to see your growth in real time, use this subreddit to communicate feelings, go easy on yourself - sleep and rest are necessary, withdrawal symptoms are REAL and should be expected, and write out the reasons you are stopping to look back on as motivation.

A few days ago we got into a big fight, the details don't really matter, but she decided she wanted to take a break for a week. I was upset, and had never felt so depressed in my life so I decided to smoke again with one of my friends. 

To all of you who have delt with long term PAWS and relapses, does smoking once or twice completely reset you? Does it only make it worse for a couple of days, or does it not have much of an effect? I can't tell if I feel bad because I smoked, or because I'm just upset about my girlfriend. I'm anxious, which is one of my normal PAWS symtoms, but I'm also pretty depressed, which does not happen that often.

I realized I had a genuine addiction to weed (and PMO/Nicotine) about 6 months ago. I smoked starting at 15 and the habit grew into daily use by the time I was in a fraternity in college.

Since then Ive tried to quit multiple times, each time learning a bit more and trying new things. I’m currently on day two and I wanted to try something different and want any thoughts.

I’m a very motivated person. Have been for a long time. I willed myself into the finance industry and after a year and a half self thought coding so I could get a job with less time requirements so I could learn and start my own business.

I’ve been able to get by with my weed usage. That’s not to say I did great, in fact, I’d say I did horrible. I only stuck around at the first job because of poor management and my current job because I’m good at it and it takes me less time than it would others. I always knew I could have done more but it was whatever then. However as I work towards my own business, managing my full time job, and a social life, weed has become a drain and I can’t seem to quit.

In the past when I quit I would quit and then go about my extremely busy day to day because I always heard you need to stay busy. (I legit plan every hour of the day, it’s how i learned to live with my ADHD, long before I was officially diagnosed.) However, I also realize stress is on of my triggers. I was thinking I hit pause on all my things, except for my job, meditation, working out, and cooking for two weeks and instead just relax after work. After that I want to phase back in to my super busy days, but I’m worried about relapsing. Should I do things these next few weeks to be better prepared? Or I should I not hit pause at all and try sobriety with my normal schedule?

I am so happy to have found this community because It gives me hope. Truthfully, I’ve been feeling quite low since I quit smoking. 

To give some context, I have smoked daily for the past 8 years and celebrated my 30th birthday this past Friday. After suffering from debilitating bodily pain as a teenager, I eventually was diagnosed with stage 3 endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome. 

Around that time, I started fucking around with my friends and smoking. I’m sure everyone remembers their early days fondly: the overwhelming euphoria, the giggles, how delicious everything tasted. Even the intense pain I felt from my ailments was numbed during those stoney hours. We would smoke once every few months. It felt like such a treat. 

College came, I moved to a new country, and left my entire life in the US behind. During those years, it felt like it was par for the course to be smoking daily, it was college after all! I also happened to be in a relationship with a stoner who always had access to weed. Needless to say, it was all very fun but was clearly starting to get out of hand. 

After college, I began my career in PR. Not sure if anyone else here works in this industry, but it is an incredibly stressful environment to be in, to say the least. Long hours, endless “urgent!!!!” tasks, aggressive/hostile personalities, constantly managing expectations, always needing to be “on”, and the thanklessness of it all really started to get to me. I’ve been working in PR for 5 years now, and can say confidently that the only thing that had kept me slightly “calm” and “sane” was the fact that I had weed to go home to (and my incredibly loving boyfriend. His support doesn’t go unnoticed, but he does not like weed at all and usually makes me feel silly for being caught up in it like this/“needing” it this much.) 

Cut to this past week, I had a particularly hard few days at work and as I mentioned was celebrating a milestone birthday. I decided it was time to break up with my old friend, weed. On Sunday night, I smoked my last joint. Monday morning rolled around and my dread about pretty much everything was at an all time high. I haven’t been able to sleep at all or eat very much. I’ve been trying to keep myself busy with work (not very hard seeing as it consumes around 98% of my time), seeing family + friends, working out etc. despite all of those things, I can’t help but feel lonely, down, and stressed without it. I’m on day 3 and wondering when it’s going to get better. 

I’m usually an incredibly private person and tend to feel like I’m burdening people by discussing my emotions. But, reading everyone’s posts and subsequent comments/support gave me hope. 

I’m sorry for the long post but absolutely any advice, insight, or even a kind word is appreciated. Thank you for reading ❤️‍🩹",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.59581214}"

I’ve been smoking every day for the past 10 years, multiple times a day. I’m an adult in my late 20s, I make more money than the average working person, and i have my own business (Backstory of why things are as easy as they are to smoke.) When i say I smoke weed every day MULTIPLE times a day I mean Sometimes I smoke 2 eighths a day. But if it’s available and i purchased a high enough quantity (a half oz) i can smoke all of that (half oz) in a day.

I want to stop because I feel like at this point i’m smoking to cover an underlying issue and I also feel like if i wasn’t smoking as much I could put my time and money into much better things to expand my life and business even further.

The reason I can’t stop is because i have the money to buy it, i own my own business which allows me to have time to work when i want to and still meet my quota, and it’s also a bit of muscle memory.

My mom told me there’s a saying, “once an addict always an addict” and I see that now. His addiction is in my DNA and I refuse to be like him, he destroyed everything he built and my trust in him because he could never kick the addictive behaviours. I can’t even begin to explain how much his borderline emotionally abusive behaviours make sense now that I know he’s an addict.

2021-10-20 13:20:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qc5yup/my_willpower_failed_me/,My willpower failed me,"I smoked daily for 20+ years and am sober now for about 16 months.

Over the decades of being a stoner I found myself in dark places many times. Depressed and defeated thinking I would never be able to escape the trap of addiction. These dark places would often inspire me to try to quit. Gradually over the next days or weeks I'd prepare myself, becoming excited about the prospect of a clean life. I'd choose a date and then stop on that day. Day by day I would get through, not smoking weed and monitoring my progress. In all of these early attempts I was clinging to the process of quitting. I used my willpower to resist weed. It wasn't in my house, but it was easy to get. I focused on the negative feelings I was experiencing knowing that just a little bit of weed would immediately fix those problems. 

Eventually temptation would become too much and I would give in, rationalizing that I couldn't cope with the ""pain"" and discomfort of quitting weed. I'd feel relieved and guilty at the same time after I had once again scratched the itch of wanting weed. In all of these early attempts in the back of my mind I think I knew that I'd be going back to weed. I just hadn't been able to accept and resolve to the fact that I needed and deep down really wanted to live a sober life. It took a lot of effort and power to resist weed with this approach. Looking back I never would have been able to stop that way. Willpower  could get me through the first bit but eventually I just couldn't maintain the strength it took.

Imagine hanging on the edge of a cliff. If you fall, you are surely going to die. You've got a good grip, you're in pretty good shape and you are strong. You can hang on for quite a while but despite your best efforts, even with your life at stake you eventually just can't hold on anymore. This is how I would describe my early attempts using willpower alone. 

I grew older and more mature, even though I was still a stoner, I grew over time and learned. The last time I stopped willpower didn't play a big role. It was about a shift in how I viewed my situation. I knew that deep down I wanted to be sober. I knew that weed (and previously, alcohol) were impediments to achieving that goal. I knew that having one hit or one drink would send me spiraling back to my old ways. The only way to move forward from this was to change my mentality. I had to disassociate from my old lifestyle and accept that I would be leaving it in the past. In the past I would have seen that as negative but that wasn't the truth. The truth was there was nothing but positive to getting sober and living a clean life. I had to embrace that and focus on taking my life there through the journey I was on. 

It worked. I stopped thinking about weed (and booze) as a thing I was resisting - they were now a thing I didn't want and a huge road block to where I wanted to go. I seen that lifestyle as it really was - negative and harmful. It wasn't going to get me what I wanted. Once I had put the effort in to train myself to see this (correct) point of view things became much easier. It's a lot easier to not do something that you truly don't want. 

I'll close my adding that this process wasn't easy. Instead of putting effort into seeing how long I could resist weed and not use it (even though deep down I wanted to) I put the effort up front on changing how I viewed using weed and focusing on the positive side of quitting and looking forward to being a sober person. It meant acknowledging that things were going to be challenging for a long time. It meant I would need to put effort as well into developing new coping skills to deal with life in a new way.",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4515739}"

I've been here a few times before, although mostly on a different account that I don't use anymore. I started smoking in October of 2018, and quitting has been something that I have struggled with for quite a while now.

I think the first time I tried to stop was July of 2019. I threw out my vape and battery and said I wouldn't look back. About 2 weeks later I bought new ones. When it was time to return to school that August I quit for a week. The week I got back I went out and bought new stuff. That fall I quit again, but that only lasted a week or two. When I went back home that December I once again threw everything out (very dramatically, during a midnight drive). But by February I was smoking all the time again. This is when it start to get more serious: I was stealing from my friend's stashes while they weren't looking, I was using any excuse to as a reason to get high.

When COVID hit and I went back home to quarantine, I stopped smoking out of convenience. I wouldn't say I quit though, because the intention was not there. It was more like I stopped smoking. That lasted until October, when I desperately asked my friends to find me a dealer. All throughout November I was getting high while trying to hide it from my parents and siblings, until I was about to run out and went on a 3 day bender, telling myself I was ""getting it out of my system"". At that point I actually stayed sober for a while.

I made it to May, until I moved back to campus for school and was once again living with my stoner friends. I kept the intention to stay sober for a few weeks, but my fatal mistake was when somebody asked me if I smoke and with only a moment's hesitation I said ""yes"". The intention just wasn't there. Before I knew it I was smoking every day, spending the entire summer in a haze. I told myself I needed to quit so many times, only to decide 12 hours later that it was ok to do it one more time. When the Fall semester started, it was back to my old mistakes. I fell behind in classes and started failing assignments. I spent all my study time procrastinating and indulging in bad habits.

That brings us to 17 days ago. I woke up at 1:30pm, having missed class and my first shift at work. Instead of a dramatic farewell with weed, I decided to get out my notebook and pour out my frustrations. I set a few goals for myself. ***I created an intention.*** I know why I need to quit, and the last 3 years of this vicious cycle are some of the many reasons. I don't want to be that person, and I know I won't change as long as I feed this addiction. To ensure I succeed this time, I'm doing everything I can to prepare myself. Practicing meditation, reading books on managing emotions, signing up for therapy, getting my sleep, and journaling are some of the healthy habits I have implemented so far, and that list is only going to keep growing.

The problem is that not an option for me, the only option is buying by the bag meaning even with the smallest bags available to buy it's still enough to do me for three days at my rate and I'm never able to abstain, when I have it I smoke it and despite always wanting to, I've never been able to buy a bag, lock it away and only take it out on special occasions or even just a couple times a week. When I get it, I smoke it all and while I usually really enjoy that first one by day three I'm ready for it to be done and am dying to get back on a break. There's times where I just want one drink, I can do that and have done it but with weed it's seldom an option unless a friend who's bought a bag gives me enough for one, it's happened before, I've done it for others, it happened again yesterday but yesterday is my first journaling it afterwards while the experience is fresh in my mind, here's how just having one after a few days off smoking went  


After smoking  one joint of weed mixed with tobacco



No noticeable difference from return to nicotine despite strong urges beforehand  


Plans during day to tackle headier hobbies once again sacrificed for cheap dopamine  


Several uneasy moments of intrusive thoughts  


Doubts over  behaviour around others from earlier on in the day which at time felt confident and bold, whilst high felt questionable  and risky


Caught between fear of having too much at once and fear of having leftover tomorrow risking sacrficing another day to the substance 


No work, no exercise , no workout  


What was intended as processed snack before cooking substantial meal wound up as dinner meaning today's meals consisted of sugary cereal and a banana for breakfast , fast food and coffee for lunch and frozen pizza as dinner despite in the days off weed having made several pizzas from scratch 


What began in my mind as scratching an itch immediately transferred into dealing with ramifications of scratching said itch ie sobering up  


Chores ignored  


Urges for bad habits I'm trying to quell stronger i.e. online shopping, porn, ordering hot food , rationale for the urges being the idea you won't be high again for a while so go all out  I did not succumb to these urges but the temptation was stronger then had been previously  


Activities I deem more enjoyable high such as walks, listening to music, watching sunset , working out all ignored  


Attention span greatly diminished, anything longer then YouTube video length deemed too much of commitment. A lot of YouTube content was rewatching old videos I'd already seen and watching a bit here, a there of new content  

Plans to have an early night scrapped


Overall the experience of going back on for just one had most of the downsides of buying a bag albeit with the saving grace that I know I don't have more waiting for me tomorrow and I can pick the break up where I left off

I have written here in the past but unfortunately only managed to quit weed for about 2 months, it was right before the pandemic hit and my ex had just broke up with me. So yes, I relapsed. The thing is the act of smoking weed has become a really big source of guilt and sadness for me (this has been growing in me for the past 5\~7 years), and I think that might be because, if I'm being honest to myself, I can't ""smoke responsibly"". If I start smoking, no matter what time of the day it is, I will chain smoke. So it is pretty obvious to me that I have got a problem with this and that I really need to step away from this habit. Quit completely.

I can bare not having an appetite and being somewhat irritable for a few days, I can't bear the sleep deprivation and that is what drives my relapses (which will make the act of smoking a growing source of guilt, putting me in a very uncomfortable cycle). If someone has had a similar experience and wants to share what they did to get going, I would love to hear. Really wanna get out of this rabbit hole.

Just smashed my pipe.,"I managed to quit for over 3 months last December - March. I really enjoyed the benefits - I felt sharper and more clear headed, more social, and I learned how to have fun without weed again. But then lockdown restrictions eased, I started going out more which eventually led to me smoking again, and it wasn’t long before I was back to smoking it every evening. 

I don’t think weed has ruined my life or anything, but over the past month I realised I can’t live a healthy and productive lifestyle while smoking weed everyday, and I can’t restrict myself to “just the weekends” like so many of us wish we could. My mind was made up when I ran out of weed a couple of days ago and told myself I wouldn’t buy any more, but I still craved it so I scraped the resin out of my pipe and smoked it. It was disgusting, and I felt like a such a crackhead while scraping out this sticky tar-like substance and smoking it for just a little buzz. I told myself I wouldn’t do it the next night, but I couldn’t get to sleep and did the same again. I feel ashamed even writing this out. When I woke up this morning I went outside and smashed my pipe and threw away all the shards. 

I’m in for a tough few nights but I’ve done it before so I know I can do it again.

**I am 60 years old and I started smoking weed at 15. Lynyrd Skynyrd was playing Free Bird and I was in a blissful summer with my compadres seeking all the joys that a 15 year old can imagine. Nobody would have ever guessed (based on the life I had led up to that point) that I was somebody that would quickly and resolutely become addicted to weed. Up to that point, I was strong in my academics and fairly good in athletics. I had a strong self-esteem and I basically fit in. But I wanted more. When I first experienced that chemical bliss, it was the most amazing thing that I had ever felt. My brain lit up and I felt like I had discovered the most amazing way to feel fantastic anytime I wanted. I was all gas pedal and no brakes. First it was weed and then I became certain that most of the forbidden fruits of the drug world could add different dimensions to that bliss I'd experienced. In short order, I ditched the academics, I kinda showed up for sports, and people that used to hang out with me took a different direction. So did I. I became intensely selfish and I strongly focused all of my energy on obtaining pleasure and avoiding pain. I also liked the idea of finding clever ways to obtain wealth without a lot of work.** 

**During my younger years I got a DUI just before turning 18 and another one just before turning 21. I went to college and I did well enough to get a degree. It would not have taken an academic genius to see the correlation between my “partying” and my grades. Getting that DUI just before turning 21 caused me to lay off of everything for about a year. My grades were very good. A year later when I thought pot would not be a problem, I watched my grades and my performance struggle. I barely graduated.** 

**Fast forward: lots of post college partying and marginal performance in my employment. I got married. I settled on a career choice that I thought could be lucrative. Seven years after I started, I became self-employed and my work and income took off. Whether it is in my drug use or other behaviors, I am obsessive. I found myself making between $400,000 and $700,000 a year. I smoked pot like a chimney every day and I would binge drink periodically. I was out of control and the only redeeming attribute of my life was my income. My wife left. I got a third DUI. I went to treatment and smoked weed all the way through and explored every possible way to cheat on a UA. I was in a lot of pain. The divorce left me reeling and financially damaged.** 

**I met another woman and decided to not make the same mistakes. I got sober without a program. I worked on being a better human being, better husband, and a better father. Four years into my marriage, my lucrative career came to a crashing halt in a publicly humiliating way and I was devastated. I relapsed. I went from about $500,000 a year, to unemployment, to minimum wage. I went from 21 years in one career to 13 jobs in the next five years. I owned some rental properties and because of the market and my inability to qualify for a loan, I lost almost everything. I watched all the things that had mattered to me get taken away and I became dead. In fact, I wished that I was dead. It is at this point that I felt like I was in the movie Groundhog Day. Every day, I procrastinated before I got nothing done. Every night I told myself, tomorrow I will quit smoking weed. Every morning, I would scrape the bowl or find more weed. I would drive like a zombie to the ATM and my dealer's house. I found stronger and more potent types of weed and all the other products that deliver THC.** 

**I worked on developing new skills for a new career. These should have taken less than four months. It probably took a year and a half. In my small town my reputation had gone from stellar to the cellar and I decided to try this new career in a different town 3 hours away. It probably goes without saying, that my new career went poorly because of my THC saturated brain. I was struggling and my first employer dropped me fast and hard. I found a second employer and I did only slightly better. At about this time, my second wife discovered that I had been lying to her and that I had been smoking weed for some time. At this point, my relapse had lasted about five years. It really hurt her and that was painful to be a part of. That was October 18th, 2015. I saw a tragic life that I had actively damaged. I saw myself continually make poor choices and cause problems. I told her that I would quit and I've never been so resolutely committed in my life. I could see how my difficult and unpleasant life could suddenly become even far worse and I wanted to stop before it happened.** 

**So, October 19th, 2015 became the first day of this journey that has lasted six years. That was 19 days into the legalization of recreational weed in my state. I didn't care. I had been drowning in a sea of weed.** 

**Today my marriage is strong**

**Today I'm a valuable employee of 6 years with the same employer and I make a decent income**

**Today I feel like living and I love the life I have**

**Today I do not experience fear regarding legal issues or authorities**

**Today I work with other addicts to help them experience the freedom that I enjoy**

**Strangely enough, recovery has been the greatest part of my life, but would not have been possible if I did not come to the end of myself and as a result of tragedies. Today, I am like a new creation compared to what I once was and it has been a blessing to go through this process.**

**I wish you well in your journey,**

In the end, I did have to leave the relationship - largely because of weed and the burden it had on us.

It was tough, I won’t lie - I struggled with sleep and cravings for weeks, but it was truly worth it. People say weed isn’t addictive but I was definitely using it as an emotional crutch. While I didn’t post a lot, this community was a huge help for me. Reading everyone’s stories made me realise I wasn’t alone with struggling with this, as well as affirming that it IS a problem and not one you should avoid.

2021-10-19 17:57:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/qbm1fd/day_2/,Day 2,"Hello everyone! I’ve been a long time lurker here and pretty much over marijuana taking control of my life and got awesome advice from my psychologist that resonated with me. Here is my story:

I have always experienced anxiety and depression since middle school, struggling with intermittent suicidal ideation though never attempted or had a plan set up. In high school, I escaped with school and extracurricular activities in an attempt to avoid my home life. My dad was severe alcoholic who had multiple seizures if he attempted to stop, and the alcohol pretty much deteriorated his brain to the point where he would confabulation because he could not recall events. 

I was always anti-marijuana and alcohol, however in college I was open to new experiences and began to drink every weekend. In my eyes it was not a problem as everyone told me it was normal in college to binge- drink on weekends.  I quickly became the “life of the party” as people would tell me and this further reassured me to continue these behaviors. After numerous hangovers, I decided to try marijuana. I lived with multiple stoners and after seeing how they could function while smoking, I figured it couldn’t be so bad. At first,  I do not particularly enjoy weed as I noticed it made me and everyone else around me unmotivated and boring, however after a year my usage increased up to every day use. I found myself relying on it to help sleep. I remember having a particularly difficult summer where I was in summer school and working, and to cope I was smoking about five times a day. I remember this being the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life and luckily was able to cut down to once a day usage. 

For a couple of years I didn’t notice it’s effect on me. I applied to medical school and got in, however I do think my applications were affected from me getting stoned all the time. I made excuses such as that it helped me relax and take a break from my high strung self. I continued my nightly usage throughout medical school, with periods of breaks for drug testing. At this time I didn’t notice its impact on my motivation, anxiety or depression.

Fast forward to residency where I am currently working in mental health. The mental turmoil and high acuity of patients that you have to deal with every day can be exhausting, and I found myself trying more and more to escape and increasing my usage when I would come home. 

Interestingly enough, I understood the implications behind addiction and dependence, the role of genetics and environment in addiction, and interventions needed. Also the evidence how THC chronically exacerbates underlying anxiety and depression and worsens psychosis. I would even counsel patients about these things every day while justifying my own usage

From time to time I would think about my dependence and how I hide how much I actually smoke from my friends and family as well as my boyfriend, however the cognitive dissonance would make me avoid the thought and I would smoke to think it away. 

I found myself attempting to quit, however around bedtime the cravings would begin and I would hype myself up believing that if I didn’t smoke I wouldn’t be able to sleep, and if I didn’t sleep and I couldn’t be mentally prepared for the day ahead.

I was able to establish care with a psychologist and she has been amazing. As I was going on and on about how I knew better and needed better coping skills for my anxiety and depression rather than marijuana, she stopped me. She stated that yes, diet and exercise and good coping skills can be beneficial for reducing anxiety and depression as well as medication‘s, but the way I was stating things things was trying to replace the feeling of getting high. She stated that getting high is an experience of itself that cannot be re-created. She said that I might not ever be able to replace that feeling of relaxation and euphoria and the biggest challenge was the acceptance of not being able to feel that again. 

Well let me tell you that hit me like a ton of bricks. This whole time I have been trying to find a replacement and wondering why nothing would fulfill the same feeling while the answer was in front of me the whole time. Nothing will replace it. So here it is to mourning the loss of that feeling and acceptance of all the other feelings that will come into my life.

I've finally reached a place where weed absolutely repulses me. I smelled it yesterday, which normally will trigger a craving, but I kept walking and felt nauseated from the smell. I no longer want to see it, smell it, hear about it, or be anywhere around it. 


It held me back from living my life.


Now that I've cut out alcohol, caffeine, sugar, weed, and made other life choices, I realized how much better the other side is and how much better I feel every day. I've forced myself into a routine, found medication that helps my mental illnesses, forced myself to use healthy coping skills, and learned some things about myself that I never would have learned if I kept running away from my problems. I'm exercising, eating better, managing my diabetes, and building better relationships with people that I avoided while being high.


One thing I learned out of all of this, I don't need friends with common interests, I need friends with the same morals and values I have. I need good hearted people who are supportive and also can find the value in life sober.


So, thank you to those who made me realize this in the chat and through posts here. I'm definitely ready to move onto another chapter of my life, and experience life how we are supposed to. With a clear mind.


I wish everyone the best and just remember to take it one day at a time. Sobriety isn't an easy choice but it's worth it. Much love to you all 💜",6,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.80662036}"

Weed is an amazingly devious drug. I loved it for so long! It made life worth living in a way. Then over time it started becoming evident it was robbing me of everything. I was good sitting still. Life was passing me by. I realized I wasn’t really good. I wanted to be more. I became anxious and irritable when I wasn’t high and when I was. I couldn’t wait to get high and then almost right away wished I hadn’t. It was almost painful to make myself do things at times. I for the most part just wanted to be left alone. Looking back at pics of me, I looked tired all the time. I had become scrawny and soft. Far different than my normally athletic physique. I had become this pathetically weak person I looked down upon in my earlier life of the Army and college. I was an empty shell truly. I realized no matter how much I had accomplished in life, it was far less than what I could have. In all, I smoked eleven years. 
One day, I threw everything out. I wasn’t gonna wait till I was out. I started working out, started reading, started working more on building a rental business. A couple months in, I realized drinking had to go too as it wasn’t any better than weed and had gotten worse with quitting smoking. It was a rough go, I’m not gonna lie. The headache was horrible and unrelenting that first few weeks. I had no appetite. The worst was the disassociation. Like I was outside of myself. Had to fake it thru work big time. I wasn’t thinking right at all. At about a month, I felt like the big stuff started falling off. Appetite came back, headache disappeared, fogginess minimized. It was easier to sleep. I started finding some motivation. It takes a while to feel balanced again though. It’s far better than where I was a year ago, and I’m still seeing improvement. I just know I did a lot of harm to myself and changed the way I thought for over a decade. I know I could be right back there in just one hit. For me, it only takes one. I will be habitual within a week. I’ve proven that too many times. I know this was long. I appreciate anyone that stuck it out till the end. If you’re questioning quitting, know that its for good reason. It’s a long road, but very much worth it. Just have to go in realizing it’s a marathon.

I am recently sober from all of it: 3 months off drugs, 1 month off weed, alcohol, and sugar, and a few days off caffeine. Each quit provided clarity and motivation for the next, but that story is for another post.

What I'd like to talk about here is how the experience of life sober and the experience of life high compare and contrast. I am outright amazed at the difference in my own experience.

I could not conceive of these differences while I was still using. My goal is to provide a window into sober life for those still using, and hopefully give enough information for another person to take the leap of faith when they are ready.

Here are a few key differences I've noticed:

* **I have consistent energy all day long.** Whether it's 5am or 10pm, I'm capable of the same thinking and activities.
* **I am calm.** It almost feels like I'm in slow-motion compared to what I used to feel. Occasionally this worries me until I interact with another person or a project and realize I'm doing fine.
* **I'm aware of things I didn't think I knew.** I make connections I haven't seen before. I use words I didn't know I knew. I can have real-time conversations about subjects previously outside awareness.
* **The anxiety is gone.** I used to believe I had a serious anxiety disorder and that drugs and weed were helping me to manage that. I have complete assurance now that was not the case. 
* **Life is joyful.** This is hard to explain, but may be most important. The experience of life itself is magical and I'm filled with awe and wonder. I've had quite a few painful experiences in sobriety, but I'm able to pass through them without getting stuck. And I have a new understanding and gratitude for the pain, because I see now it is just important as the other parts to experience a complete life. In many ways, I feel higher now than I ever did while using. The ultimate experience is life itself.
* **I'm available for others.** I look forward to answering when someone calls, as opposed to dodging them and making excuses like I used to. I can hold space and listen to someone. I don't feel compelled to tell everyone how they should live. Relationships are returning in droves.
* **Unfinished business is getting finished.** Half-completed projects are finally getting done or dropped. Housework is being done. Long-overdue changes are being made.

This time I'm coming to this with the mindset of quitting for good and having that mindset and completely changed things for me. Still have the cravings, the night sweats, the vivid dreams, food aversion, but deciding to commit to quitting has changed how I relate to those things. It is much more temporary in the grand scheme of my sober future. I also find that I am practicing WAY more self-control and mindfulness with my thoughts. When I took breaks I would let my mind wander to when I'd smoke again, the food I'd eat, how good it would feel, how easy it would be, and it made my present and future miserable. Now when I start to think about the high, I actively do my best to stop the train of thought, go through some mantras and reasons for sobriety, and just take the power of my mind MUCH more seriously.

I have been marijuana free for seven days now. At first it was very hard on my body and stomach and I couldn’t eat more than a small meal and a few slices of toast. I had trouble falling asleep earlier than 6 or 7 in the morning. I’m sure you all know how unpleasant it is to be alone with your thoughts during withdrawals. It’s difficult guys but it’s literally a waiting game. If you can make it a few days your body will feel so much better. 

Now I have two meals a day, getting easier each day. It’s easier for me to go to the grocery store and look for things without panicking. But I still feel uncomfortable when I’m outside the house.

I think the next week and the ones after that will be less of a physical battle and more of a mental one. I’m hoping that jogging regularly, eating better, and my therapist will be able to help me through It. I always got high to cope with loneliness and boredom and suicidal thoughts, so those hurdles remain. I have always been a fearful anxious person my entire life so it’s not like sobriety is a silver bullet for all worries. But I hope it will be easier to work on my issues with a clear mind.

This might be a lifelong battle but not all hope is lost.,"I spent late spring and all of summer sober and I rocked it. After reaching another period of comfortable stability in my life, I thought I'd take a little road trip and buy me a disposable vape pen to reward myself and we all know how that goes. Part of me was simply curious. Would I get that glorious high like I did in my youth after not being high all this time? So I drove across state lines to the nearest dispensary almost like I was in a trance. Like it was calling me and I had to go and so I did. I got my vape pen and took one hit and boy did my lungs feel like they were being squeezed. I also immediately missed being sober.

I got stoned and it was....meh. Too familiar. This might sound like a broken record for some of you who've been around here but it's a healthy reminder: your ""glory days"" of smoking are over. You're not going to get that high like you did when you were younger and didn't have a care in the world. Yeah you might enjoy it and it might pull you back in but it's a sensation your brain is already too familiar with. When I got high after that sober streak, I felt like I was right where I left off only with cleaner lungs. 

I went through that vape pen and I've been sober for about 4 days. I've already accepted the fact that I'm probably going to be tempted and make another trip. But the thing I realized is that I know I have the power to tip the scales. Going 7 days sober is now easy mode. Hell going 30 days is a piece of cake. I used not be able to go a week without getting high and now I don't even think about it as much. I could have got some more yesterday but didn't bother. I have readjusted to long periods of sobriety and sort of found a remnant of my old self.

it's not even fun anymore.  when I first started using weed, it was amazing- it made me think interesting new things and look at things (especially music) with this really cool new perspective.  now it literally just makes me tired, stupid, lazy, and eat way too much.  nothing is even fun on it anymore, it just makes me feel like a zombie that isn't actually part of the universe.  just watching the days ago by in this tired haze.  and then for days afterward I have tons of anxiety and brain fog and can't do anything.  

this last week really drove that home- because as I'm coming down from it now, I'm feeling that hard-to-describe anxiety that only weed has ever given me.  it's like this constant feeling of being on the verge of a panic attack, it's just the worst.  i feel anxious and dissociated from the world, and all the things I want to do/have to do feel so much harder than they are.  i can't think straight, and I know sleeping is gonna be a bitch for the next couple nights, which will make it feel even worse.  

the bad parts of weed are just so much more powerful than what little ""good"" of it is left for me, which isn't really anything at this point.

When year 11 rolled around I started having hypomanic episodes, dissociating and cycling extreme moods. Since then it's all been a rollercoaster. I continued to smoke to cope with these feelings. Things kept getting more extreme. I would get sent into a state of pure joy and confidence but I would become someone I don't recognise. Then I would crash and be lethargic, depressed and dissociated. It has been never ending.

Things have gotten better and worse. I have noticed a severe cognitive decline as I smoked more and more. My manic state would temporarily fix this and I was fooled into believing that when I felt this energy and joy that it was how I was supposed to feel and craved it constantly.

This is day 1 right now. I relapsed 3 weeks ago after 4.5 months of sobriety. At the beginning of the year my smoking got to a point where I could no longer feel the same manic energy and joy that I had previously felt and after a near suicide attempt the reality of life set in and I was feeling prepared to let my mind recover. My hope was slowly diminished as a severe cognitive decline set in. My memory and focus have completely left me and continue to get worse. I struggle to think. Anxiety fills me everyday and there's no room to think. I can't process the world around me anymore. It feels like all the good qualities I had before I smoked have completely faded into dust. I obsess all day about how fucked I am and how I don't have the control to do the most basic shit like cleaning and conversating. I struggle to conversate at all nowadays.

I'm lost on what to do at this point. I've been biking at least 10km everyday since I first quit and it has become a chore but I'm afraid if I lose that habit I'll have nothing to live for.

My feelings and questions.,"Some background; i'm 28 years old and started smoking at 21, 22 it became an every day thing (I quit for 8 months at one point, and some 2-3 month breaks). To take an inventory of my life in the last 6 years is depressing to say the least; don't have my license, was unemployed for 4 years, have never lived independently and I haven't had sex or really any intimate female contact in 3+ years due to my pathetic state. Don't really have any friends except a couple I talk to online from High School.

 I've been working for these last 3 months, moved into a new apartment (still with my dad). It's hard for me to even imagine quitting; it feels like i'm two different people high/sober, when i'm sober it's hard for me to carry a conversation, I can never think of anything to say, im nihilistic and depressed. I can't even see getting through the week i'm so miserable every single day at work even though it's so much better than all the retail jobs I've had.

 But then I smoke, and most of that goes away, and I feel hopeful, like I can make it to next week. It doesn't feel like I can escape the fact that I was never motivated, nihilistic, and hopeless before I started smoking, and in that 8 month break even though I was in a new place, new job, I was still in a generally poor head space, and wasn't improving my life. 

To sum it up I feel like I need to quit in order for my life to start improving, but i'm scared; when i'm at work/sober I can't help but to summon to mind all of those things that are wrong with my life at all times, and it cripples me.

As the title says, I’m on day one. One of many many failed day ones. I’ve told myself uncountable times that now this is it, I’m done and I’m going to do better. But without fail around 10 in the evening, I’ll manipulate myself to go buy some weed and that I’ll just “take it easy” this time. Only smoke in the evenings after a productive day etc. But every damn time morning comes around these thoughts come back and I’m right back to where I was just like that.

It’s taken me a long time to actually accept and realize that this ain’t normal, and I can’t keep justifying my actions just because it makes me feel good. And honestly it doesn’t even make me feel that good anymore, it’s just something I “need”. 

One of the hardest parts i feel, is that i know in myself i can not just smoke casually, every time it leads back. It’s insane, I can be sober a week or two, smoke a joint thinking I have control now, but it’s like my brain is in love with weed, and just a little taste spirals those love endorphins and I end up without fail buying my own weed the next day. 

I’m so sick of this. So sick of not being able to remember what’s a month ago and what’s three months ago. My thoughts become hidden behind what feels like a grey foggy cloud and I can pull out some, but a part of my brain is just stuck in snooze mode. Even writing this I’m having a hard time trying to piece my words together to something that makes sense. I’m sick of spending so much money on weed, it’s like weed money isn’t even really my money it’s the weeds money and I have no control.

I‘m 26 and started smoking weed just this year. But I smoked heavily and it felt good to let all the sorrows drown in the smoke. I don‘t even know why I didn‘t see it as a problem until now…. Maybe it was the people around me I felt good with? Idk.

I smoked nearly every day since January. Before this I maybe smoked 1-2 times in my life…. I didn’t felt addicted cause I had my life together. Job, family, friends, it was all great and I thought it’s the best year I’ve ever had so far for me. (I see this expression as a problem now!)

I had the urge to quit smoking when I felt I got unreliable to my friends. I canceled occasions when there was no smoking included and so on…

I’m now clean for nearly 7 weeks and it hit me super hard. I’ve never expected the withdrawal symptoms to be this hard.
The first 3 weeks after quitting were ok. Then I had several panic attacks out of nowhere and the hardest time of my life begun.

I just feel so empty and hopeless inside, I have so much anxiety nearly all day, I’m not even able to work cause it all feels way to much for me…  I try my best to only do the things that feel good for me at the moment but the next second anxiety hits hard and I feel I’ll be never be happy again in my life.

I was always a strong minded person so it’s hard to pin down for me, what has changed in the last time. It all hit me so hard, I even went to therapy and think about changing my job, cause I can’t handle any kind of stress at the moment. I don’t want to see friends or family cause it is all too much.


Did anyone ever experienced the withdrawal symptoms so hard?
It’s nearly 7 weeks now and the drug tests I bought are still showing positive.

Well, today I noticed it sitting on the hallway shelf, with crumbs and all. She'd forgotten to take it back to her room with her. I immediately set to scraping out as much of a little pile as I could, already planning my evening, coming up with excuses and promises it would be just this once.

I realized that I wanted to stop after noticing last year I've spent zero time sober. It was always wake up, smoke, go to work, come home, smoke, and then do it all over again the next day. I stopped smoking in the mornings before work to give myself a sense of clarity throughout the day, but recently I've started again. I stopped smoking blunts because the nicotine is terrible for my ADHD, and while that took A LOT of the addiction away from it, I'm still hooked. My main reason for quitting is financially, I'm just tired of being broke because of it, I'm tired of weed being the thing I always figure out how to buy instead of the countless other things I can put my money towards. I try not to think about what I could have or should have done, I'm just honestly over it. I don't wanna smoke anymore until I can actually afford it and it doesn't dictate my life anymore. Simply put, I'm doing this for freedom. Financial and mental freedom.

I just wanted to know if you all had any tips on how to keep my mind busy and overcome the boredom I feel when I'm not smoking? And also, are there any self help videos or any other tools you all have utilized in your effort to stop smoking?

When life got back bit to normal and my workplace reopened, I stopped doing the “hard stuff” but I was still enjoying smoking weed. I told myself it’s not a biggy doing it from time to time. I created a promise to myself I will only smoke after some exercise. This laudable promise didn’t last long…
Fast forward I started smoking almost daily, lying to myself how much it was helping me managing work stress and how proud stoner I was. 

After some time, my mental health started go bad fast paced… anxieties, depressive episodes, memory and concentration problems. I didn’t know what was wrong so started smoking even more, stupidly believe it would help me. In the country where I live, the weed is illegal and I was only buying some cheap strains from local dealers. I didn’t have much knowledge about indica/sativa, I just smoked whatever was available and for reasonable price… I was just hurting myself without knowing.

Now I am on meds because my depression and anxiety have become unmanageable with suicidal thoughts as well. Yesterday, when I was at really bad places I grabbed the weed again and it fucked me up big time. My anxiety went through the roof, I couldn’t stop shaking, horrible tinnitus and I just turned into complete zombie. My bf was not happy what I did because I was essentially putting salt to my wounds (hope you know what I mean lol) 

Yesterday, it was a wake up call for me. I don’t wanna smoke anymore. I want to get better. I want to be functional human being without crippling anxieties probably induced by weed. I want to live life meds free. Sadly I have addictive personality so it will be hard and I am sure I soon will be tempted to roll one. But I don’t want to.

I’ve been smoking weed since I was 16 and I’m now 26. It became an everyday thing for me around 18-19 and I’ve been consistently doing so since. 

I also managed to develop (and now thankfully, kicked) a pretty serious drug problem, and I was using weed everyday to help me deal with other more serious cravings. I know how it sounds, but it’s been working for me up until recently. 

But I’ve been realizing that although I’m not using hard drugs anymore, there is still part of me that is using weed as a substitute because I don’t want to deal with my emotions head on.

Anyway, I tried to start Friday after I finished the last of my flower, but admittedly had the tiniest bit of a cart left that I used to help me sleep last night.. but now even that’s gone and when I woke up this morning I could feel how irritable I was and how weird I felt and I’m scared.

I know I can do this, but it’s going to be hard for me. I don’t really know why I wrote this post, I guess it helps to put into writing how I’m feeling.

Here’s what it’s all about.,"I’ve mentioned it in a few comments and posts, and I’ve been asked about it, so I thought I would make a post. Be mindful of the “pink cloud” effect that is part of recovery. Essentially the initial phase of recovery will find some reconnecting with emotions that were otherwise muted during drug use. The pendulum can swing, so to speak, too far and these feelings of emotions can be intense and powerful. They can also feel really, really good. Unnaturally good, in fact.

Reality will set in eventually, and while it is ten gazillion times better than drug use, settling into homeostasis can be slightly less extraordinary than that initial pink cloud phase.

I am a recovering alcoholic as well, and I have experienced this phenomenon both with stopping drinking and with stopping cannabis. Not everyone experiences it, and it wasn’t as intense for me with cannabis as it was with alcohol. I just wanted to explain what it is for those of you who haven’t heard of it before.

There are plenty of resources out there if you want to learn more. My experiences are my own, though, so please know that this is not advice.

Yesterday was one of my worst night ever, I couldn't find peace. First I had to give all my smoking stuff to a friend so I don't get distracted, then when the time to sleep came I became super anxious and I was puking all the gastric acid from my body, I puked so much that my gastric acid became green like wtf. I slept only 4hours.

I woke up today again very anxious, I puked a bit in the morning then I had to walk outside so I can breath correctly. I didn't eat or drink anything today.

I’m moving to a country where weed is absolutely zero tolerance and, despite fears, am pretty excited at the opportunity to not rely on smoking so much.  Have a family and two great kids (under 3 years) so a lot to look forward to.

I’ve been lurking for a while but main reason I post is I’m looking for other long time, heavy smokers that quit to tell me some of the benefits you’ve seen.  I’m hoping for some motivation to get through what appears to be a difficult withdrawal period after such heavy use (based on the posts here).

I’m pretty hopeful about sleeping earlier, being less foggy, being less apathetic, being less a slave to smoking, better health, etc… but also am reading many posts / comments of people not really seeing many of these benefits in the medium / long term.

It’s an inspiration reading some of your stories, especially quitting when it’s still available vs me having no choice.  I have told my stoner friends though: “ if I had a magic wand and could make it legal where I’m going, I don’t think I would” :)

I wanted to quit smoking weed back in late 2019. I was pretty close too. 3 months sober and was even on my way to stop vaping as well. That’s when covid hit and it had other plans for me. I fell into a deep depression and started using weed as a crutch. I attempted to quit a few times after that and was very committed to getting clean. Not sure what happened but later into the year, as the pandemic kept growing, I stopped giving a shit about quitting. It’s been about a year since I gave up on quitting. I don’t smoke a lot of weed but I do smoke daily. I have a small one hitter and take 2-3 hits after work, and before i go to bed. It helps with a few things that I won’t mention (in case it tempts people) but it negatively impacts me in more ways than 1. 

I‘ve been smoking weed regularly for 3 years and while I have cut down a lot since I first started, I want to quit altogether. It has created a tension between me and my family as they don’t like weed at all, it creates problems in my romantic relationships because of how I act when I’m high and my post-high brain isn’t always at the brightest. Like I said before, I use it as a crutch for negative emotions and to kind mask what I’m feeling. It’s a bad coping mechanism and has caused me to avoid many of my problems. I’ve become a different person than I was and I don’t feel good when I‘m high but also don’t feel good when I’m not. 

Anyway, now that I am back to a place that I know I should quit, I wanted to get some support and advice on how to quit. I want it to stick. I also want healthier coping mechanisms to my anxiety and depression so if anyone has something that works for them, that would be great advice too! Anything helps!

It’s getting dark and it’s the same time my plug delivers in my area. The sunset hitting my room is a site I remember way too well and has defined me for the past months.

I’m laying in bed and feel incredibly strange. I kinda just want to burst out in tears, not truly because I ran out but because I can’t comprehend how I let my life get to this. I’m only 19 and feel as if there’s no hope for me. I continue to make the same mistakes and continue to always find myself making big steps and changes and improvements or at least I think I do, until suddenly always falling back to rock bottom. The first half of the year was my spring semester, and when summer hit I had practically almost burned it all in weed. Fall started and got my aid, and am literally seeing it bleed in front of my eyes. It’s so obvious what I need to do. It’s just so obvious and it’s making me feel like I’m genuinely programmed in this life to not win. 

I am literally beyond petrified at how I’m going to be facing reality alone very soon. And to make matters worse, it’s not the “reality” I knew a week before fall started when I had managed to stop myself from smoking for 2 weeks over the end of summer. This reality is one where my stupidity and weed smoking has made one of my classes extremely fucked, who has put aside a lot of studying and work and momentum in my independent studying, parents extremely disappointed in my lack of motivation recently.

I don’t know what to do. I can buy now and numb the thought for a few days. But it’s not a solution. It’s so obvious it’s not, but fuck, the way I’ve been feeling, the way I’ve been neglecting my health and body and how I’ve been hurting physically and mentally lately, it kinda doesn’t even make sense to think of the future because I’m not even sure ima be there to live it, so might as well just enjoy now.

I keep thinking to myself, if I don't change something... anything... now, then I will remain the same. I don't want to move forward five years, or even one year doing the same routine I'm doing right now. 

I quit drinking in Aug 2020 and I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I was happier, less stressed, a good employee, making a decent contribution to my life. However, I used cannabis as a crutch to help me quit drinking. Now cannabis has taken over and is affecting my daily life. I can't keep living like this. 

I started a 90 day fast from weed over 90 days ago; I made it about one month in when I smoked the small amount I had left and have been smoking and buying more ever since. If I knew that one small bowl would put where I am today-- smoking daily and hating it-- I probably would not have smoked. 

Well, I'm trying again and plan to stay stopped. I don't know moderation and have never succeeded in portion control; Complete abstinence is the only option for me.

No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see that we can still sink further and experience more pain. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will re-appear. We will lose interest in our fellows and gain interest in selfish things. Self-seeking will be our way of life. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will return. We will intuitively know how to sabotage our lives and the lives of those we care about. We will suddenly realize that we are doing for ourselves what even our enemies would not wish upon us. Are these extravagant promises? We think not. We witness them frequently and we see the results - sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize.

My husband and I have hit a final limit with weed after ten+ years of daily use. It's taken a long time for us to hit this point and its come for different reasons for both of us. I'm feeling strong but intimidated and thought it might help to get my history out. For perspective, I'd say we're not crazy intense smokers but certain moderate. We go through about an ounce to an ounce and a half every two weeks at this point. I've been smoking daily or near daily for about 10 years.

If anyone bothers to read this, thank you. But mostly this is for me, to reread when I feel weak, and with the hope someone might see themselves in my story and have any advice to share.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My parents grew cannabis illegally when I was growing up, a fact I didn't know about until I was in my twenties. Both my father figures smoked, my stepfather multiple times a day. My mom smoked daily when I was little but kept it to parties as I got older. I was around bongs and joints from birth. They were usually discreet and I was never offered any as I grew up, and seeing adults be both drunk and high on various substances at parties meant I just never felt the mystery or rebellion behind getting high, just as much as I didn't view it as negative either.

I smoked a few times in high school and through my twenties, but always smoked with daily smokers with high potency flower, and got way way too high. When I went through a serious depression for 3-4 years at the beginning of my 30s, I started smoking alone when my then husband(not the current) would go out with his buddies for a night. Taking one or two hits and disappearing into cartoons and cereal once or twice a week gave me the toehold on calm and happiness I needed to eventually dig myself out of that pit of despair(including my marriage). I swear it was like physical therapy for my brain.

Smoking was occasional and for pleasure until I went through a year of daily migraines, 3-4 days of small events with at least one nearly paralyzing event a week. I was on a multitude of medications that didn't do much for it, but one thing did- weed. Chronic migraines teach you \*systems\* of pain, I used to be able to draw diagrams of different kinds of pain, and had nicknames for some of them. Needless to say I started smoking quite seriously and knew my helpful strains by heart. During this time, my state went legal. No more limits on how much I could have, as long as I had the money.

I was at the end of this crazy year when my neurologist found the right combo of meds, and the migraines stopped. It was also the year I met my 2nd husband. He'd smoked crazy amounts of weed in his early years with his buddies, but hadn't in years by the time he met me. He tried my medical stuff a few times and got way too high. But eventually his use regulated with mine.

Then it got worse. He has severe ADHD, and at the time was resistant to medication from years of being badly medicated as a kid. Weed helped. A lot. It became our ""porch time"" sitting out in the trees, listening to music. When we found out I was pregnant, I slowed down almost entirely, but if this is about being honest, I still smoked more than I should have. It was so easy when he was still smoking and my body hurt so much and I just wanted a good night's rest. But this is where I began to feel like I might have a problem with smoking.

Then we lost the baby. At 30 weeks, he died inside my body, and was there for five days until I was able to give birth to him. Obviously, it destroyed us both. We have a really incredible relationship and worked through everything we needed to, but it took two years of hourly dab rounds and my husband being hospitalized for CHS to get us to stop dabbing.

If you're not familiar with cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, I won't try to explain it but basically, your body begins to reject cannabis, and it involves round the clock vomiting, almost complete insomnia, and an inability to keep any foods or even liquids down. For days. It took my husband an ER trip for severe dehydration and 6 weeks off work to be capable of functioning like a normal human again. He lived in the shower(hot water both soothes symptoms and is a compulsive behavior with CHS). It was terrifying.

But it wasn't enough to get us to quit entirely. We chalked it up to the cheap metal dab pen we had. It had to be something in that, right? He'd never reacted to weed in his life until now.

Fast forward a year and we smoke daily, but the vape pens are gone, it's only flower and its restricted to before and after work. I'm still wanting us to cut down, we're spending a lot of money on weed and many times I just don't enjoy being high anymore. The nature of his ADHD creates a creature of habits, routines and rituals, and his smoke times were definitely entangled in that. And I felt entirely helpless if it was around. Do I want a hit? Of course I do. The answer is never no. Even when I'd spent the drive home thinking ""god I just want to be sober tonight."" But when the bowl beckons...

We are pregnant again, yay! I do really well with staying off weed but still take a few hits now and then.  I start talking to him about how I don't want her to grow up seeing us smoke weed constantly like I did with my parents. We agree to stop smoking before our daughter is born. It doesn't happen. Once I stopped breastfeeding, the pressure of a newborn and those rare sacred moments of alone time got eaten up by smoking weed. It felt like our only relief for a while.

Winter hit, and we stopped going outside to smoke. We kept it to the bathroom but I knew it made the whole house smell. I was only smoking after work, but he would smoke before work, come home at lunch and smoke, and smoke with me after work. Weekends were nothing but smoke sessions before our daughter woke up, when she went down for a nap, any time we could let the other go outside for a few minutes. And that's been life up until August.

My daughter and husband have birthdays a week apart. She turned two this year. Husband said he wanted to get some edibles and a moon rock and have a nice weekend to play video games. Sounds great to me! We loaded up with fun meals and some beer and all our cannabis goodies. Then CHS came calling, two and a half years after the first.

Another ER trip where he's passing out in the car and I'm terrified something has happened to his heart(chronic vomiting can fuck you up). Three weeks of being functionally a single mom, listening to my husband throw up his soul every hour. Worst was that he entirely missed our daughter's birthday. We don't do much because she's only 2, but had plans to decorate the house, make special cupcakes and give her some really cool new things like a trampoline. He missed it all, sick either in the bathroom or laying in bed desperate for rest. By the day after her birthday I was exhausted to the bone. It hurt to not have him there, it hurt to know how ashamed and sick he was. I'm just glad she's too young to be hurt by it too.

So we said- okay, we're done. But we still had 3/4 of an ounce jar in the house. I told him okay, I'm going to return to my own relationship with weed. I just want to smoke every couple of days after work. And that's how it went, until he felt better. Then it was just one hit here or there with me. Then it was more. Within a few weeks, we were back to our daily bathroom smoke sessions. And this time, it's \*me\* driving the heavy use. I'm not sure why. I'm not a ""stoned all day"" kind of person and my tolerance lifts very quickly. But we're in a new rhythm, husband started college classes and my hours at work have been reduced a bit, it's all good but it's all change- maybe I've been more stressed out than I realized?

Three days ago, he got sick again. I've been on my own(blessed coincidence, I'm off work) with my daughter and while millions of single parents do this every day, I'm unsure how. I'm so fucking tired and compressed from not having more than her nap time to think to myself. So I've been smoking, even though the smell in the bathroom is making him feel sicker. I did my best to cover it up but felt angry. Why does this get to be the time my addiction has to be dealt with, because he's sick? I've always felt pressured to smoke more because he smoked more. I've laid the blame for our habits on him quite a bit. I stubbornly kept with it in the bathroom these last few days, limiting how much I smoked, covering it up with candles and airing out the room as best I could.

Last night after our daughter went to sleep, I smoked again, and sat with myself for a bit. I had thoughts like, I don't feel normal unless I'm high anymore. I used to feel refreshed and invigorated on days I didn't smoke, so having another bowl felt like having a dessert. Now it's desperate. Just help me feel less compressed. Just give me that soft blanket feeling around me.

This morning I told my husband I'm giving the rest of our ounce to a neighbor that smokes. We're agreed, we can't go through this CHS thing again, we know we have to quit before our daughter becomes much more aware of her surroundings, and we're tired of the expensive. He won't admit to it, but I know it will help our motivation and productivity. We're parents of a toddler who both work in creative fields- smart use of our time is tantamount, and we've been farting around getting serious for a long time. This all seems like the right time to quit for good.

I'm on good medication for mental health issues. I've more stable and happier than I've ever been. So is my husband. And it seems weed is becoming more and more incongruent with our life goals.

So... where does that leave things?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm intimidated by what I'm likely to feel without weed in my life. Obviously we use to cover things up. A former therapist of mine liked to say ""You can't selectively numb with drugs. You numb the things you need right along with the things you're trying to get rid of."" I know this is about finding alternatives to self-soothe when I'm tired, hurting, anxious, or bored. Now I'm not the kind of person to run out and get some when I don't have any in the house- but my husband is. And I'm the codependent people pleaser with PTSD that has a brutal time resisting anything my husband wants to do- especially when it's something that is fun for me too. So I'm relying in part on his ability to stick to this. I know it's only down to me in the end. My relationship with the drug, my reasons for using, including my reasons for laying the responsibility at his feet as often as I do. I think I'm afraid of the mental anguish I used to live through before I started smoking. I was such a deeply broken and unhappy person ten years ago. Absolutely tortured with no way to see out of the prison in my mind. I've worked really hard to repair my mind, but this coping mechanism is still there. And I love it. I'm afraid to not have it. Will I feel the same physical relief, the same unshackling of my mind through taking walks, making art, drinking more water? My mind screams NO. You won't ever be that happy again if you quit weed. Life will be even harder than it is now.

And that's why I needed to write this post. There's a small part inside me that is shrieking with panic over the idea of quitting. But I'm done. And I'm going to wrap myself around that small part of myself and tell it we're loved. We're safe. We're going to be okay without drugs. I don't know how... I just have to believe.

the good passes. the bad passes. stress is temporary. joy is temporary. weed is how I tried to hack life's highs and lows and just skip all the discomforts. weed just numbed me out and delayed any real learning to cope in meaningful ways. weed takes my edge off, but that edge is what helps me feel that I need to change or get out of something terrible. it does me no good in the long run if I'm putting up with shit I hate or numbing out to the ability to think and accept change.

meditation teaches me to sit with it and let it pass. comfort and discomfort are pretty much the same, but my reaction to each are so different --- either desperately craving the highs or desperately wanting to avoid the lows. being weed-free helps me stay in the moment so I can see through my own lived experience that I can live aside any storm until it passes bc it all passes. that's the reality. there's no need to control anything outside of myself. the need is to learn to control myself, accept myself, accept what is. stop reaching for control and be present to what is. 

meditation has helped me so much -- being able to learn to sit with things as they are, getting to feel the good and the bad changing and passing, experiencing everything just passing. it's all temporary and weed was my way of trying to hold on to the good and totally not feel the bad.

This was expensive but I was addicted.,"Cons.

1. Couldn't eat. 

2. Couldn't fall asleep. 

3. Anxious mess. 

4. Could not collect my thoughts. At all. Think looking for a needle in a haystack.  

5. Hot flashes. These sucked but I got a preview of menopause. 

***I immediately started working out and sweating as much as possible. I believe this helped me and is still helping me. 

Pros. 

1. Clear head. No more space bunny eyes. 

2. My hair doesn't smell like smoke. Neither do my fingers and my clothes. The yellow tint on my nails are gone. 

3. I can breathe better. Literally. My lungs, the space in my throat where the smoke used to linger and irritate me. Even my voice comes out more.. smooth.

4. I have so much time. I didn't realize how much time I wasted in weed sleep. If that makes sense esp with Indica strains. 

5. I'm BORED! Truly bored. So bored that I fucking started cooking. If you knew me you'd be surprised. 

6. This one is sometimes a con. I am forced to confront my feelings instead of smoking them away. I am discovering that I can be a brat. That I do have a spine. That I'm not stupid. And that I have to work on my personality instead of hiding behind the weed. And also, I'm a decent human being worthy of living a safe and comfortable life.

7. Savings. This is BEST one imo. I used to not know what to do with any extra cash after paying bills. They'd just go into weed and food to eat when high. 

8. I am now making plans to get back into school and start a family. I feel the way I used to expect being an adult feels like. 


**I'm not sure what made me stop smoking. I can't really say. But it was inspired by me realizing that I'm away from people who used to oppress me and I don't have to live in fear like I did when I used to live under their roof.

I've been thinking about it for a while now. Over a year ago I quit drinking and sort of replaced the drinking with getting high. I think I was in denial about it being as bad for me (and don't get me wrong I do think drinking is way worse on your body and even actions). It just doesn't make me feel good. 

I also find my heart rate increases and I start doubting how well I'm breathing and it scares me sooo so much. 

I told myself that I do it to relax but it has the opposite effect on me. I googled why it makes me feel like I'm dying when I do it (not all the time but maybe 50%) and it's because it's effecting the back part of the brain that triggers anxiety and paranoia instead of the front of the brain that makes you relax. 

Anyway that doesn't matter. I don't like the way it makes me feel so why did I continue smoking it for so long? 

Well since quitting drinking I've been able to hang out with my best friends I've had for years and them being okay with me not drinking cause at least I was smoking with them. Im sure they'll be fine with my choice of wanting to quit this too but I guess I'm scared that I will lose them cause I'll be too straight for them or something? I unno. I hope they continue to just accept me for me.

As soon as I felt that, I asked why she couldn't support me in my time of need. And from there the floodgates opened. Everything I had been suppressing with my smoking  came barreling out.

Some of deeper issues came out, and I had to leave the house in tears for a couple hours.

Good news though. I didn't break. I didn't smoke! I went to my cousin's and I broke down. Even though we aren't the closest, but it helped to talk to someone. She ended up giving me the number of her therapist, which I am now going to have to work up the courage to call. I've known that I need one for a while, but I'm scared.

I'm scared of being diagnosed with depression/anxiety. Even though I have self diagnosed myself with it for years. I'm scared of the repurcussions of having that diagnosis on my health record such as life insurance premium increases or worse-- cancellation/norenewal.

Eventually regular THC carts weren’t enough and I started only smoking live resin carts. My parents were both law enforcement so I always needed to be desecrate, and unfortunately carts allowed for just that. Eventually, I’d easily go through a full gram in about 3-4 days without fail. Each time dropping about $55+ at the dispensary when I inevitably needed another. The workers wouldn’t even ask me what I wanted anymore because they already knew. It just got progressively worse until when I finally had realized I had a problem, I just didn’t care anymore. I’d wake up in the morning and felt sick in my stomach until I took at least 2-3 rips off my pen. My short term memory got so bad that I’d forget what I was just previously thinking, sometimes even mid conversation. I didn’t think there was any chance I’d be able to quit because every time I tried to psych myself up for it, I’d ultimately end up convincing myself that I needed it.

2021-10-17 01:57:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q9sw85/my_experience_day_2_no_weed/,My Experience (Day 2 no weed!),"After reading all of your amazing stories, I not only feel more motivated than ever to quit smoking weed, but it also made me want to share my experience with the hope that it may help someone else, or be relatable in some way. I’m beyond excited to be a part of such a supportive group of people. This is how my story has gone:

Before I started smoking weed I was an honours student for my entire life. I excelled throughout high school and university and I found learning new things to be incredibly exciting. The self esteem I had at the time stemmed from my ability to remember things, and from my ability to focus. I found great pleasure in understanding and remembering the tiniest details of whatever topic I had chosen to study. I believed in putting 110% effort into every thing I did and settling for less than my best was not an option I’d consider. I was the captain of my varsity basketball team, I worked out 6 days a week and tracked all my macros religiously. I played the guitar and loved to learn new songs and perform in my school concerts and shows. I enjoyed other hobbies like speed cubing, chess, and playing kendama. Additionally, skateboarding and skiing were also something I was quite passionate about. I filled my free time with productive things that I loved doing. Overall I was excited about my life and my future. 

I began smoking recreationally every so often with a few of my buddies. I thought it was super fun and noticed that I had the most amazing sleeps after as I had always struggled with falling asleep in the past. I loved laughing uncontrollably and talking about our “amazing ideas” like saltine cracker and raisin sandwiches. I set a rule for myself that I could only smoke with friends and that smoking by myself would be a bad habit. After realizing how relaxing and fun it was to smoke a bowl, watch Netflix and devour copious amounts of food, I very quickly broke this rule. After a short amount of time my “only smoking with friends” rule became “only once before bed” and then “only 3 times a day” and so on. After repeatedly justifying my actions it got to the point where I was smoking 3-4g of flower each day plus any dabs I could get my hands on. Wake and bakes, middle of the night seshes, and THC oil under my tongue became a normal thing. I felt I couldn’t do anything anymore without smoking first.  Although I’ve toned it down a bit recently, I’ve now been a daily smoker for almost 2 years and the negative effects have more than manifested themselves.

I no longer find enjoyment in the things I once loved. My memory has gone to complete shit. I can’t focus, and learning new things seems fucking impossible compared to my old self. The brain fog is next level on a daily basis. I don’t trust my ability to recall correct information anymore and this in turn causes me to second guess my memories. I feel apathetic and unmotivated which has had a negative impact on all of my relationships. I often choose to stay at home and toke alone instead of seeing my friends and family. The worst part is I know I want to see them. I’m now in the worst shape of my life and trying to motivate myself to workout again seems impossible. I eat like shit almost every day now too because I’m too lazy to cook when I’m high. I don’t read before bed anymore because i know I’ll forget the content by morning. I waste so much of my hard earned money on weed too. I have felt like this for months yet I keep smoking. 

Well enough is enough!! I showed my stoner buddies r/leaves earlier this week and then we had a long chat about what is truly important to us in life. After some much needed self reflection, we are all going to try and quit weed now!!! We’ve made a group chat and scheduled daily meeting times to help support one another. Thanks to the amazing stories and comments in this subreddit I feel truly motivated to get my life back. Fuck living under the warm blanket of weed.

Have a long history of marijuana addiction since I‘ve been 18.  I smoke weed every single day without exception. I've had several sober stretches in my life (I think the longest was 2 years) where I quit cold turkey.

I have my own house, car, a puppy, a cat, I have a good job and make decent money which is great and I try to be thankful for that.

But I live alone and work from home since 2010. I have no friends.

Since the pandemic, I go most days without talking to anyone or interacting with anyone except perhaps my mom (who is really trying to help me and my hero/idol) or the 2 min interaction at the dispensary.

For a while I was spending some days of the week with my parents for a few hours but I started feeling depressed about that... as a single man in his late 30’s spending so much time with my mom and dad. This makes me feel even more pathetic. I should have a wife and a family and kids.. or at least some friends. But I don’t because all I do is smoke weed and stay home.

When I'm around people I can only tolerate short encounters now or else I start getting headaches because I’m not use to all the talking from them and effort required from me in these interactions.  
Due to being in this depressive state I talk in a soft meek voice, usually with very short phrases as I don't want to engage anyone in a long conversation. I usually don't talk much during an average day (or at all) unless I take a phone call for work or from my family.

My girlfriend of 5 years who was my only friend left me for someone else at the start of the pandemic. Been single since then. She is getting married and moving in with him. I have not even gone on a single date.

I stopped going to the gym when they first closed. I haven’t been back. Lost my whole physique that I worked on for many years. I can't stand to look at myself lately or be in pictures. I don’t smile because my front teeth are getting stained from smoking but I feel too zombified by the end of the night to brush. Now I’m out of shape.. fat. Losing my hair.  Losing my time, my life. Lost all my confidence. I only stomach junk food due to how much weed I smoked.

Crying a lot. No Energy. I am completely isolated. Throat hurts from smoking 2-4 grams a day with tobacco + cigs. Coughing out black stuff and lots of mucus. I can’t make it past day 1.

3 years ago I had not smoked weed in a couple years or cigarettes in 10 years. Was super healthy and in amazing shape. I was deadlifting 500lbs, bench pressing 285lbs and squatting 405lbs at 35 years old naturally.. Was weighing 200lbs at around 14-15% body fat. Was improving in all aspects of my life. Felt very confident. Still had depression but it was manageable.

People treat me differently now because I don’t put much effort in my appearance. Women don’t look at me and smile anymore.

Spending thousands on weed. Buying small amounts of weed everyday telling myself I’ll quit this week so don’t by a lot. End up buying more every single day.. I go to different dispensaries I because feel embarrassed to go so often. Been doing this since I relapse 2 years ago.I feel like shit and have suicidal ideation. Every time I attempt to quit I can barely get out of bed.. I cry randomly and I’m angry frustrated all the time. And I always relapse because I am so lonely. I just lay in bed thinking about wanting to die but knowing I'll never go through with it.

main things keeping me going are my cat, dog and my mom.. And the hope that I’ll pull through this like I did before.

I used to smoke 3- 7 joints daily. I was a UN employee and was deployed in Iraq, yemen, syria and other places. Being deployed in those places took a toll on me and I resorted to weed to make me forget the things ive seen and the stories I heard. I've never smoked during or before work, but I was always looking forward to going home and having my after work hit. 4 months ago, I moved from my country to another continent. Change was hard on me and caused me to smoke even more since I don't know anyone here and my social skills are very weak. However, whenever I smoke I slip into a sever guilt trip. I became so dependent on weed to a point where i didn't do anything without smoking. I hear good news, I smoke to celebrate, I hear bad news, I smoke to forget, I get hungry, I smoke to make the food taste better, and if im not hungry, I smoke to get hungry. My other issue with weed is that it makes boredom tolerable, so I had no motivation to do or try anything new. 

I tried to quit many times and every time I found a reason to go back. Yesterday I was looking for an online support group and I came across this sub. Your stories and the experiences that you guys shared here gave me a huge boost and willing to quit and never go back. Therefore I decided that today is the day. I threw away the stash that I had, and im now ready to walk through this journey. Wish me luck and I'll try to keep you updated.

I now think this is a giant myth and I can prove this. You can too if you have a smart watch. I'll explain.

I got a new smart watch (Galaxy Watch 4) and I was checking my sleep cycles - awake / light sleep / REM / deep sleep.

I was shocked that I was barely in REM / deep sleep even though my sleeping hours were 6-7 a night. Some nights even zero REM sleep and 10 minutes deep sleep.

After doing some reading I realized REM / deep sleep is critical for the brain and body. This is the sleep phase that allows us the brain and muscles to heal. While smoking weed my brain and body were barely healing. No wonder I felt like crap during the day. 

A week ago I threw away all my paranephelia and herb and after just 2 nights I noticed my REM sleep was reaching nearly 2 hours every night and deep sleep 30-45 minutes. I lot more sleep cycles too. 

Yes, I miss weed during the day. But I enjoy having a good night sleep much more.

My decision to be sober comes from a chat with a friend a few nights ago - he suggested that if I can stay sober for the rest of October, he’ll treat me to a nice meal (He’s loaded, so I mean $400 nice…why the fuck wouldn’t I want that?). I figured it would be easy and agreed - it ended up being difficult as fuck, and I realized I was hella addicted. I also realized that there’s way more to do in the world than just smoking weed - and that was a very liberating thought, that my time would be devoted to things that are very tangible and enriching for my own mind. My second day of being sober I sobbed for thirty minutes then had a panic attack in the middle of a tutoring session. I was extremely suicidal at this point and essentially grasping for a reason to keep at it - I then realized that this journey was very similar to the path my friend had been on as well - the unhealthy thought process that I was only a burden and I only brought pain to the world, that taking my own life would be the only way to help others, that I was using weed to escape my own perceptions of reality and thought processes, and that staying numb wouldn’t do a thing for me. Then it struck me that when he took his own life, he didn’t want me to be caught up in it forever, to be debating over suicide and following in his footsteps. He truly thought that what he did was best for him and the world around him. I don’t believe that’s true at all. At the same time, I know that the best way to respect his wishes is to make my own waves in life, to pursue my dreams of becoming a doctor, and traveling to korea, and finding a wife to love and raising a family with her. What I’m saying is, I haven’t found my purpose or direction in life yet, or the will to keep moving forward. But what I have found is the will of the ones I love and the brothers before me who have struggled in their battles with their own demons - even if I don’t know why I live for me, I won’t allow myself to pass or keep using if that is not what those that I love would want. So I’m making that choice to stay off the stuff. And I’m fucking sticking to it, for the ones I love.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46013948}"

I recently completed a workshop where we chose a life vision and goals, determined a fitting strategy, and mapped daily habits on a schedule to get us there. Setting a direction has been so helpful to me, especially in early sobriety.

Greetings!

Smoking has been a really big part in my life. I’ve been smoking for 3 years about ( I’m 20M) and I’ve loved almost every moment. I have adhd and anxiety issues and when I started smoking my life changed. I learned how to calm down and love life and I found myself more and who I was. By the time I was outta highschool I was smoking dabs every day because it just helped me with life so much. It made doing nothing doing something. 

Along the line my tolerance grew and grew. For a year or so I’d say I smoke a gram of dab a day. It went up and down from 4 grams of dab a week to the other week where I hammered half an oz (14gs I think) in two weeks.

I never thought I’d quit smoking. I never considered it or thought of ways to quit. That was until I had a really intense episode. I get so angry to where I can’t control myself. I sweat and in the mornings my entire body is sore from so much flexing. Usually when I have these episodes I take a big dab upwards of 0.3 grams. Expect for this time I experience something that changed my perspectives. I had what I like to call a disassociative state of mind. It scared the hell out of me. Everything was so intense and I smoke and forgot about everything that happened to me that night. I couldn’t recall anything really and I felt like the person that experienced that wasn’t even me. This started to spin and I felt like I was psychologically breaking into something irriversable. I’ve always had a suspension I have some psychotic disorders and that just confirmed it for me. At least it felt that way. sense then every time I smoke it brings on anxiety and I get uncomfortable in my own skin. It’s never done this to me in the 3 years I’ve used it. But yet I continue to smoke. I know that I’m gonna be anxious and uncomfortable immediately after coughing and wishing I didn’t just smoke. But yet I still do it to myself lol. The feeling kinda fades when I smoke small amounts out of a glass straw but I don’t get what I would consider high. More like buzzed then I feel ok. Then that leads to me getting used to it and smoking bigger and bigger amounts until I disassociate again. It’s happened twice within a month and that can’t be a coincidence. It’s pretty obvious to me now what I have to do it’s just how. 

I really enjoyed smoking everyday because I would function. It’s not doing what it use to anymore I suspect it’s doing more harm than good to me now. And that’s something I want to find out.  it’s time for me to part ways with Mary Jane. I want to quit but I’m having a hard time saying goodbye because it’s done so much for me and I feel like it’s part of me at this point. 

So what are some ways you guys have quit? My issue is that if I have it I’m gonna smoke it until it’s gone it’s hard to regulate my usage. Currently I’m out and I’m not sure if I should re up. It’s quitting cold turkey a good idea? Ive tried using a cart to slow myself down but I burned through it in 2days and they are not cheap. Ive noticed it’s too accessible to me in cart form and I will try and maintain the small high I get throughout the day. What can I do?

2021-10-15 19:02:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q8znsw/almost_2_days/,Almost 2 days,"Hey everybody. First off I'm sorry if this isn't very organized. I'm just trying put everything down in words. 

I just quit smoking weed after years and years of daily use. I have not gone a day without smoking for as long as I can remember. 

I started smoking weed when I was around 17. It was my best friend who got me into it. I had moved to a neighboring town, but weed really reconnected us. I made a point to bike to see him every weekend and get high. Weed opened us both up. We were from different schools, both with little friends. But once we started smoking, we just fit into more friend group. I became more social. I loved it. I had friends. Life was great, weed was great, friends are great. 

At 22 I met my now wife. We were both large pot heads. We smoked everyday. When we ran out we would scramble until we found more. My mom and grandmother had just started smoking around this point as well, which just enabled me even more. All I had to do was show up at my grandma's house and she would make sure I was taken care of. (Rip Baka) 

Years fade away in a cloud of smoke. 

Around 5, 6, maybe 7 years ago. I decided enough was enough. I quit. I'd just call it a t-break at this point, but my original plan was to quit outright. I think my break lasted 2 maybe 3 weeks, and to be honest, I cheated. I smoked behind my partner's back claiming to still be sober. I should point out that my wife was and currently still is smoking. 

One day after work, I went for a drink with a co-worker. After having a couple and knowing that he smoked weed, we went back to his truck. I told him I'm ready to get high now. He told me he didn't have any weed, but he had some shatter. I had never heard of the stuff, but when he compared it to honey oil, I was all in. He told me he was just gonna give me a little one. I told him I wasn't a bitch and to give me the same as him. 

And wow. It was like smoking for the first time. I felt amazing. I questioned why I had ever wanted to quit to begin with. And I quickly fell back into smoking. And hard. At first I mixed joints and dabs, but I quickly turned into a only dab guy. Since that day, I can count the number of days I haven't dabbed, on one hand (the days I didn't, I smoked weeds roaches, resin whatever) 

The feeling was always there though. That I shouldnt be doing this. That smoking this much wasn't healthy. Even though my smoking never got in the way of anything. I always paid my bills, but there was almost always enough money for THC. 

5 years ago daughter was born and 2 years later my son. I smoke in the garage but we've never hid it from them (weed has been legalized here for quite a few years). Again I've always known that getting high was not how I wanted to spend my kids childhood. 

I could probably go into more detail about why I want to quit. But to be completely honest, just writing what I have was hard and had me a little anxious. 

But here I am.  DAY 2! I might be shaking, I might be a ball of nerves and sweating profusely. But I am doing it an I am proud of myself. 

Thank you for listening. And good luck to everyone else who needs it as much as I do.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.706925}"

This is the first time i quit without intention of going back, after failing in about 10 moderation attempts of all kinds.

Thinking back, i’m starting to reflect on all of my lowest points in life while i was using weed all day everyday for about 12 years almost nonstop (I’m 33 years old). It’s funny how only when i’m sober i remember and feel shame about it (By the way, when i’m high i sometimes think back about how i can be a real jerk while sober, but this is maybe a topic for another post).

Anyway, here are a few of the lowest points i reflected about.

1. Back when it was harder to score weed in my country, i once spoke to a past friend which i haven’t seen in 2 years, because i remembered that he was quite a stoner, so i said i wanted to meet him but what i really wanted was weed. He had told me he made a special surprise for me, so just like that i DROVE 3 HOURS to visit him, only to realize that the surprise was some kind of a toy/game, which i don’t even remember since i was so focused on getting weed. I’ve spent about 2 (boring) hours with him, and cursed and screamed all the way back home.

2. I spent all my money on it, and got into an overdraft (this is one of the reasons of my current quit attempt). I was at my grandpa’s and he brought me some money as a gift for my birthday, instead of spending it on something useful or save it, i just spent it on weed like it was nothing. Like i didn’t have negative balance in my bank account.

3. A few months ago, i drove while i was very high and stopped to pickup some takeaway food from a place near the gas station. When i got back after 10 minutes i saw 2 guys holding my car to stop it from roll backwards. Apparently i forgot to lift the hand-break and didn’t put the shift on parking. I was so high that i didn’t even knew how to thank them or apologize. I just said “wow… wow… i can’t believe it… wow…”

Anyway, i got plenty more of this horrible stories, but this was probably my top 3. I can’t believe what weed had put me through. I feel so ashamed about it and i’m writing this post also to remind myself why i should never go back to this habit. It’s over. I’m out. Fuck you weed, it’s not working anymore between us.

The last 2 weeks it's been so obvious that I just refused to work through any of this & I used pot as a daily escape. It was my hideaway. My secret place. My warm blanket. Anyways...I really wanted to/really want to get high for the first time since I stopped. It feels like my withdraw symptoms are peaking, but I can't really tell. All I know is that my brain is playing tricks on me. It's testing me to see how serious I am. And I didn't give in.

At least while I'm sober, jokes i make and jokes I laugh at, others also can partake in which often makes me feel even better because then I've laughed with someone or sometimes even made someone else laugh. The only people I made laugh while stoned was other people who were stoned but even then that wasnt often because quite frequently were sitting in silence too baked to think. 

While sober, I find myself more carefree and light-hearted too. I don't know why but weed made me feel like unless I was stoned then I couldn't relax. I forgot how to relax without weed and that became a problem.

Every time I've tried to quit, I've never felt support from my stoner friends. That lack of support doesn't really come from the fact that I won't be getting high with them anymore (we do other stuff together besides smoking weed), it's more from a lack of understanding. When I explain my reasons for quitting (it affects my memory, my speech, my motivation, my overall health, etc.), they kind of all have this ""it sucks that weed has that effect on you"" attitude, and I've never had one stoner friend think about or voice the effects weed has on them. They're actually more likely to list the effects of not smoking, and the reasons why they need the bud. Most of them say that weed is what makes them get through the day, what makes them tolerate people, what reduces their anxiety... And I feel like I'm the only who thinks that, yes, weed can help with those things, but that those positive things come with a price. 

Do you guys think this is denial or is it actually possible for certain people to be heavy, chronic smokers and not feel any side effects? 

I get a bit upset thinking about this because when I talk about it with my friends, they kind of make me feel weak for saying that weed has an impact on my mental health. Are they not also capable of self-examination? Or are they actually real, totally functional stoners on whom weed has no negative impact?

currently day 4, so quite new to the community- though a long time silent scroller as I worked myself up to finally commit. 

like many here, weed was one of those insidious addictions that just slowly took over until I looked up one day and didn't recognize myself or my life anymore. what started as a harmless hobby in high school cause I preferred the stoner crowd over weekend drinkers, turned slowly to the thing I relied on to relax and eventually became the best friend and crutch that allowed me to numb out the depression and pain. 

I work a Sun-Thurs sched and so today is my first ""friday"" sober...and truthfully I'm struggling. truly, ive done my best to keep myself busy in effort to plan ahead by making plans with a friend for dinner and then headed to the gym to try and stay out of the house for as long as I could. but now I'm home and literally all I can think is ""whats the harm in just one joint, just tonight"". I know it won't just be tonight though. 
so.. turning to this community cause y'all seem to be the only thing that helps stop the noise in my head. 
if you're up for it, drop your reason for quitting below, or offer a line of encouragement. hoping we make it through this night together.

So now (to my demise or rise) I literally can't afford it til my next paycheck and honestly not at all. 

I'm scared. My brain sucks lately. I just watched an ASAP science video on quitting marijuana and it explains so much. Weed affects your experience of novelty. The hastened firing of neurons in your brain and increase in dopamine cause somewhat dull things like sounds to seem more interesting. 

So that's why it's so hard for me to not use when I'm bored or need to do something boring. I convince myself that weed helps me-- and it does.. only sometimes. But I can't use only sometimes. So much to the point where I have fried my sense of novelty and curiosity for things I usually enjoy. I just smoked my last joint an hour before class. Then zoomed into class because I had a panic attack. I just let the chemicals in my brain convince me that weed will make everything better and more fun. But the chronic use makes it so much harder to have fun.

Your appetite will come back. Your sleep will come back. The vivid dreams will calm down. The night sweats will go away. Your depression and anxiety will abate, but if you're like me and they were underlying conditions that you were using to self-medicate for, you need to find other ways of addressing them. 

If you give up and smoke, you'll be back to square one and it's not worth it. If you're committed, fully commit. Toss your stash, get rid of your paraphernalia, delete your dealers numbers and block them if they send you unsolicited texts.

But I also love
My kids
My hobbies
My fiance
My income

Smoking weed 
Makes me forget things. My kids are babies, I don't want to forget this time.

Makes me too lazy for my hobbies. Writing, birding, hiking... I've basically quit these hobbies since my consumption has gone up. I miss these things, they're more fun than being couched.

Makes me stay up late, stoned on the couch. As such what little time my girl and I have alone is usually squandered by me mindlessly scrolling the internet.

Makes me lazy at work, if it wasn't for my cushy job I'd have lost it by now. I'm the sole breadwinner, there is no plan B. Risking this income is insanely irresponsible.

Makes me stupid. Recently lost a bunch of hard-won money doing stupid shit with crypto at 1am stoned out of my mind. 

My prospects are fantastic, I have everything going for me. Been blessed, but marijuana makes me too complacent. Time to nut up and buckle down, and I need my conplete faculties if im to do what I want to achieve over the next few decades.

Smoking also makes me short of breath lately, and this was the straw that broke this addict's back. Laying in bed beside my two year old, gasping for breath. Self-inflicted. It's pathetic.

I've not left my house for more than a day, for more than maybe eight hours, for more than two days a week, in two years.

I took to weed to fix this. I leave the house to buy weed. I come home and smoke weed and do something numbing. I don't want to do this anymore. My friends are concerned, offering me a place for a month. This is my last pod. I'm buying things I know I'll need to ease my withdrawal symptoms that I usually use my weed money for.

I figured out I was trans due to it. It helped me feel the extent of the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse I'd been compartmentalizing for years. It also is not medication. It is also making me numb, okay with something I've been ignoring for years.

I'd discuss the abuse in more detail but suffice it to say that my mother is an anti vax transphobe and that is reason enough for me to fear for my safety.

I want to feel hopeful, but tonight I'm looking at the remainder of my pod, knowing it'll only last tonight and tomorrow, and I just feel horrified that I won't have my coping mechanisms anymore.

So i'm now 38 days Sober. And it has been an absolute Hardcore Journey til here. I kinda feel i want to give my experience on to others, that have currently began their Journey or think about going down that Road. The Symptoms you can have Cold Turkey are really frightening and have surprised me a lot, i never thought that you could have serious PHYSICAL Withdrawal Symptoms. Here We Go 

First week, i experienced horrendous night sweats, inner nervousity (like ants crawling through my body, nasty feeling), Sleep Insomnia ( have it anyway ), Nausea for few days only LUCKILY, loss of appetite. 

Second week, everything passed except the inner nervousity, got a few times headache 2-3 times and thats it.

Third week, Crazy Depression started kicking in, i was crying all over the place, countless times a day, idk why, i just had the urge, and i just let it flow and it felt GOOD, idk if i have surpressed this for so long (was smoking 13 years a gram a day).

Week 4, And here starts my biggest problem til now, i've spent my WHOLE adultlife High, i don't know if i have high blood pressure (symptoms don't really match, i have no arm or chest pain, no nausea, no fainting, no sweating hands) or if I'm actually a naturally sensitive person that has Anxiety? I don't know how to explain this, maybe some others that have the same symptom could explain it to me? I think i have Anxiety/Panic attacks. Which is horrible, all these years High i never had an anxiety or panic attack. This has left me with being conscious about my heart beating, often. It's Bullshit actually, i went to the Doctor but everything was fine. Maybe i'm mentally somewhat broken after all these years, nonetheless I DO NOT GIVE A FUCK. I DO NOT CARE HOW STRONG I THINK YOU ARE BEATING OR WHAT MY BRAIN TRIES TO TELL ME I AM NOT GOING BACK! NO NO NO! I am sick and tired of this.

Week 5 Had once an anxiety/panic? Attack. Besides that, no other symptoms of withdrawal anymore. YEAAAAHHH BABY YEAAAHHHH.

So i'm gonna be honest, if i would've known it is that horrible, i would have slowly reduced my intake, i was anyway ready to let go off weed and i think reducing WOULD have been an option, but now it's too late. I sincerely hope that this consciousness about my heart beating will stop one day (preferably yesterday lel)

Please, if you consider to stop, just do it. Do not Postpone what is inevitable. You ain't gonna die High with a Blunt in your mouth, we all know that. The more and the longer you smoke, the harder it's gonna get, so just stop. Remember all the Money you have wasted, remember your HEALTH, Weed breaks you Mentally and Physically. Remember, what you've lost in all those years, all the missed opportunities that slipped through your fingers. All your friends and relationships you've lost. We all love the High feeling, but ultimately, it has more downsides.

I've smoked for 9 years, this is my 3rd quitting attempt. Prior to smoking last night I was 12 Days sober. 

My first week sober was EUPHORIC. I naturally meditated & exercised without any distraction-- like a switch flipped. I felt like I was never going to smoke again. 

However, Days 10 - 12 challenged me with depression and ridiculous sleepiness. I scoured the internet for people with ""healthy"" relationships with weed to justify my ""one-time"" use. So I ended my night with a bowl, which felt fine. Nothing special, just fine.

But that's the problem for me: I want to smoke every single day. I got through the day just fine -- I have things to occupy my mind and don't need to smoke. But it's nighttime; and I can't stop thinking about how much better I would feel if I were high -- KNOWING that I quit to improve my relationship, my health, my memory, and feel the years of emotions I have suppressed. I cannot go back to daily over-use. I can't go back to feeling ashamed of myself. I can't go back to numbing my mind. 

The cravings are insane. I feel so fucking angry for struggling with it. Angry that I can't enjoy it without feeling stuck to it. Angry that I don't feel happy without it. Angry that I've bottled years of trauma that my body is processing all at once.

A little background on myself: 

I started smoking around the time of the lockdowns (April 2020) and since then I’ve become more of a daily smoker up until last month. Smoking weed started as a social thing and eventually turned into just a thing I did as part of my daily routine. Got to the point where it’s all I looked forward to in my day. At the same time, I was also in my last year of being an arch. student. Finally graduated! Looking back, I wonder how I got things done on time and with my usual going above and beyond expectations I put on myself. I had an internship at the same time, lots of responsibilities and still managed to get through it all with smoking but still couldn’t see pass the day until I had a hit of my pen. Literally survived on it to get through the day. 


Why I decided to quit/ take a break: 
No matter how high I got, deep down somewhere I always had this feeling that I needed to stop and allow myself to feel again. As I said before, I started smoking socially to have fun with friends but eventually it became my escape, a way to pass time or a way to suppress how I felt. Long story short, my upbringing as a kid and journey through college has been rough. Smoking helped me forget that and just enjoy my own peace but at the same time I kept feeling stuck and just the feeling that I wasn’t going to move forward if I kept smoking. I felt disconnected from everyone, never present and friends would also say that I sometimes seemed distant. And also smoking started to backfire, rather than having a pleasant high I started to get intense anxiety and over-thinking which felt really uncomfortable. So yeah I decided it’s time. 

 The journey within the weeks: 

Week 1: Rough as hell. I’m not even gonna sugarcoat it, I had so much anxiety, moments of depression, over-thinking, mood swings and the feeling of just being stuck. How I coped? I kept telling myself focus on the present and let these intense emotions be your fight, drive, anger, whatever to keep pushing. I also meditated, journaled, and exercised which helped.

Week 2: Not too bad, just like week one but it started to calm down a lot more. I started to feel very foggy in the brain and disconnected with my surroundings but ultimately I felt good. 

Week 3: Same as week 2, a bit more relieved, I felt more connected and I definitely started to feel more motivated and inspired. Also had a job interview which went well ( I’ll explain more later) 

Week 4: I can’t help but smile when I type for week four because I was just proud of myself for going this long without weed. The idea of not smoking months ago sounded insane to me but let me just tell you life isn’t too bad when you quit. If not earlier, around this time I started to realize how important it is for me to start taking care of myself mentally because I do have my moments of anxiety and slight depression which was only fueled more by smoking. Having been cleaned for almost a month and feeling a bit more content and better mentally was only proof to me that I made the best decision by quitting. ALSO, around this time I had a second interview for a cool job opportunity that I was able to get! But I do have some stuff I want to share with you all about that. Especially for those who are thinking about giving up smoking or recently have stopped smoking. 

Week 5-(today): I am thankful that I made that decision for myself to stop smoking. I do have moments where I reminisce the pen and the high but I don’t think I’ll ever go back to it. I think it was important for me to feel again and go through whatever I went through these past weeks because for a whole year I’ve been suppressing a lot of feelings. I realized it’s okay to be sad, bummed out or upset and it’s also important to let myself feel in order to move on rather than suppress. That’s the key I believe. 

So about this job opportunity, pretty awesome and I’m excited about it! However, I’m stressed because I’m getting tested soon but I should be 45+ days clean by then. Anyways, I’ve tested myself and I think I should be fine, really hoping I am, but I share this experience with you all because when I started smoking it never occurred to me that I would get tested one day. I can be naïve sometime. Anyways, if you’re like me a recent college grad, or in college but looking for jobs/internships or just in the process of looking for jobs and also thinking about quitting weed I would recommend you do it now. Never against smoking/weed but save yourself the anxiety, stress and trouble. It’s crazy that they still test you for this when it’s legal but it is what it is 🤷🏽‍♀️

Anyways, it’s day 39 and I feel great. I’ve traveled since, I’ve cried a lot, I laughed a lot, I journaled a lot, I’ve watch many shows not high and really understood what’s going on, got a job offer and ultimately just feel so much more content with life, hopeful and most importantly present. 

If you’re reading this and you’re on day 1-10000 or thinking about quitting I just want to let you know I’m proud of you and that you got this. The journey is never easy, you can read all the Reddit posts in the world but everyone’s journey is unique. Embrace every moment, the ups and downs and remind yourself that tomorrow is a new day. Who you are in the past is in the past, focus on the present and you’ll for sure get there. The rest is still unwritten :)",12,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42988598}"

For me, the first day especially, but basically the first week or so, was always excruciating.

I realized that all those months/years that I'd been smoking, I'd been using weed to suppress all kinds of unpleasant/painful feeling states each and every day. For me these included: boredom, loneliness,  sadness, anxiety, dread, insecurity, shame, guilt, anger, and futility, more or less.

I had been pressing them down inside me each time I toked. And they didn't go away just because I pressed them down. They stayed inside me. And when I finally stopped smoking, the cumulative total of these feelings resurfaced like a nightmare. It felt unbearable and insurmountable. It felt like I was dying!

I wish I had someone to let me know that this was actually a good sign, scary as it was. It was all the stuff I had been *needing* to connect with for a very long time. I had to feel those feelings. There was a lot of crying. I don't believe there was any way around it. 

I also want to mention that I couldn't have done it without support. I worked with a therapist and felt very supported by this subreddit when I eventually discovered it (I wish I had sooner). I've come to believe that we're not meant to be completely emotionally independent as human beings. I think we're meant to be here for each other.

You guys have inspired me when I was trying to quit,"10 months! I've surpassed the longest I've been without smoking. 
I started on January 1st 2021 (stopped smoking, but started a new journey!) 
Previously I was smoking between 1 to 2gs everyday for the past 10 years. 
I've tried many times before to stop smoking, but I've never felt like I feel this time, and hopefully, will be the forever.

As I said, Ive tried many times before, from 3 to 4 to 7 months without smoking and then suddenly I would decide I should try to smoke one to see if I was still addicted. Of course the day after I was buying a bunch of weed to stay high everyday once again.

As we had two sets of quarantine and was working from home I was smoking a lot, and started to think I should stop. So I gave myself about 6 months to stop smoking. I thought that if I would smoke a lot of weed during those 6 months I would not miss smoking it. No Fomo!
 So for some months I was smoking 25g every 10days. Joint after joint after joint. I was high all day. 
Then January 1st came and I smoke my last joint at around 6 am. 
The first days are always the hardest.
But what came after was unexpected. 
I felt free for the first time. I put so much thoughts about quiting that I made up my mind that I was going to quit, and it feels like it has worked.

Many of my friends smoke. The first dinner at friend's house with them smoking was hard for sure. Now I feel much better. My neighbors smoke and the smell most of the time annoys me, few times makes me wonder if I would try again, but I keep firm. 
Once someone offers me a joint I say no, 'I don't smoke anymore'. It's very important to practice this NO. Once you say once and twice it feels good inside!

With all the money I was burning I started to put into crypto. Not that I'm a big investor, and haven't taken any profits yet, but if I burn money, now will be in crypto. Maybe in a few years that will amount to something. 

Biking has helped a lot as well, and bike friends pushing for me to go further and do more kilometers.

My skin is better, my memory has also improved. My conversations got better, and I think my bursts of energy or in discussions have dropped. I feel calmer actually. Every time I have an issue I'm not running away to smoke a joint and I'm facing it.

I'm creeping close to 6 months sober. For four years I smoked like it was my mission to ruin my life and for two I battled very hard to keep sober.  In those six years, I've hurt some people pretty bad. When you combine trauma, mental illness, attachment issues and cannabis you create a pretty horrible person.

I realized a while ago that some of the people I've hurt may never forgive me. That's actually understandable.

The hate and guilt I've carried for myself has weighed down on my conscious heavily.  I know this sounds selfish at first but I've realized I have to forgive myself. The thing about this guilt I've carried is that it doesn’t serve them or me. Rather, it serves to increase the risk of me going back to who I was. Perhaps they want to see me suffer like I caused them to suffer at times. I can’t blame anyone for this, it's only natural to want retribution.

Whether those I hurt agree or not, I deserve redemption for my mistakes. I need to forgive myself. I can’t change the past and who I was but I can control who I am now and who I will be. I forgive myself. I forgive the pain I caused, not because I’m selfish but because I know that I’ve changed. I strive to help people. I’m a human, I’ve made terrible mistakes. Though, years of therapy and people seeing the good in me has paid off. I’m not the same person they knew. How do I forgive myself? With the knowledge that I will never cause the same pain again.

**You need to forgive yourself.** Forgive yourself by knowing you'll fight with every fiber of your body to never repeat the same mistakes again and stay sober. It happened, it's over. All we can do is move on and create a compelling future for ourselves and those we love.",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50549126}"

I've been coming back to this page over and over every time I try to ""quit"" smoking. My experience is similar to many I've read here. I developed the habit of smoking out of a need to escape many things in my life that I simply didn't have the energy or ability to change/fix/face head-on. I became so dependant on this escape that I lost so many drives and passions for life. It became all about the escape. Now I find myself having smoked away whole years of my life, my physical health in horrible condition, and my mental health in complete shambles. I feel like I don't even know how to be a functioning human. There are many steps I have to take to get control of my life: seeing a therapist, getting a primary care doctor, eating well, and moving throughout the day, but I know I can't actualize these things and continue to have a weed dependency. I also recognize that this dependency is a symptom of larger issues I need to address, because I was at one point last year smoke-free for three months but found other escapisms (huge amounts of time binging television, sleeping, etc.). So I went back to the weed to cope again and on goes the cycle.   


I guess I am posting here to hold myself accountable in a material way and hoping that community support will help. Thanks for your presence.

Trying for the millionth time to quit.,"I've been a daily smoker for years now. I have a medical prescription and everything and I smoke probably 3 times per day. I've been through phases where I've smoked much more when I was pregnant and had hyperemesis. After both pregnancies, I've managed to taper down to just 2-3 joints per day, but cutting weed out entirely has eluded me for years, despite my desire. 

I have chronic pain, so quitting weed with no pain management in place is extra hard :/ Weed no longer effectively treats my pain at a dosage I can afford. I've spoken to at least 4 doctors about my wish to stop relying on cannabis (including specialists at the pain clinic and at the cannabis clinic), and it seems that my options are either to go UP to heavy prescription drugs (no thanks, quitting those after a medical procedure ten years ago was fucking HARD and makes weed look like nothing) or DOWN to mindfulness etc. I will not explore prescription painkillers because this is a long-term condition. Therefore, I am left with my mental toolbox and that's it. I've sought help and there is no help.

Two weeks ago, I tried quitting cold turkey. I put all my weed in a rubbermaid, put the rubbermaid in an inconvenient place, and installed Grounded on my phone. I caved at the end of day one, and day two. For about 4-5 days I was able to get by on a single joint. After that, I lost the will to quit and started smoking 2-3 joints a day again. The app continued to mock me for another week asking me to check-in lol. 

Now, I finished all the weed in the house and want to try again. I wish I was more determined but living with my pain instead of treating it fucking sucks so its not like I get to revel in feeling so clear and rejuvenated etc. the reward will be having a few extra hundred bucks in my monthly budget i guess.

I just told them i won't this time around and it's been awkward because i don' want to make a big deal out of it.

The worry for me is complacency. My friends are coming over and thy all smoke/drink. I am not worried about wanting it but only about getting complacent and letting my guard down. 

I have never made progress like this before and am genuinely worried i might just say fuck it when complacent.

 Should i just tell them about the reason i quit? I feel like i should but i don't wanna make a big deal out of it.

The cravings are manageable now and that doesn't worry me. What worries me is complacency, which i have noticed is the prime reason for most streaks breaking.

Any advice would help. Thanks.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6496064}"

For 8 years I heavily abused weed, knowing it's bad for me, but kept on doing it. Deep down, I did not want to stop.

From Jan 2021 to May 2021 is where abuse became an addiction. I  wanted to stop, but couldn't. I'd hate myself after getting high, but re'up as soon as I ran out. I lost control.

Felt like a puppet on a string. Life was a mess, I enrolled in 5 courses but failed all of them. Never bother showing up to class, never did the evaluations. Didn't care, didn't think about it. Quit my job as a mortgage advisor, can't be a professional if I'm high from wake up to sleep.

During this time I learned, I don't have the balls to kill myself. Kitchen knives are too dull, and jumping off the balcony requires a running start. 

I live in Canada when I'm fortunate to have free counseling support from both the university and workplace. The words of a professional addiction specialist stuck with me: ""If you don't truly want to stop, I can't help you"".

He was right, that was the reason why all my previous attempts were unsuccessful. I never wanted to stop, I always craved getting high.


Today is day 141 for me. No weed. I am so so happy while I am typing this. 

I think all of our experiences are different, different environments, different ideologies. We all have different lights in our lives that can help guide us through the struggle of weed addiction. I'm a lucky man, my mother never gave up on me. Transparency with her is a huge help for me.

I hope all the folks here can have a helping hand to pull them out of the mud. It is so hard to do it on your own. Though, I believe, the hardest part starts with you. The ones who love you unconditionally will only get hurt by you because when weed is occupying your mind, you dgaf about anyone or anything else.

1. Do you really want to stop?
2. You want to stop, but you can't help getting more when you run out.
3. Ask for help!! Parents, Professionals, friends, Reddit, etc. This world isn't too cold :)
4. Never give up. You might fail, you might fail multiple times. KG said it best: Anything's possible!

I'm confident to face myself now. This post is staying up!

Eventually I was told I was disabled, lost my job, and had to be put on Social Security Disability (after a few stays in a mental-hospital ward against my will.)  Over the next 11ish years I smoked...a lot, increasing to basically as soon as I woke-up until bed.  A while back I began feeling...off (hard to describe); my neck would twirl around in circles on it's own...Yesterday talking to my sister she said she had anaphylaxis from being allergic to weed and it closed her throat.  As soon as she said that I figured I knew what was up; I tried to quit NUMEROUS times and just failed miserably within a day every time except once when I made it a few weeks.  When my sister said she was allergic I looked it up, read, then dumped half an ounce in the trash and threw away my pipe.  That was yesterday morning.  The last week or so I have been pounding anti-histamines and anti-mucus pills and my neck has stopped moving like crazy while I continue to (quite obviously) open my throat and (gross sorry!) spit almost pure-black mucus.  To my surprise the rest of yesterday was...fine, as was today.  I think I failed before (at quitting) simply bcs I allowed myself to.  I am feeling good and this time I KNOW I won't go back to it; after all I wouldn't eat like shellfish or peanuts if I was allergic.

Thanks for letting me vent.  Surprisingly I don't even feel I need to do that as much!  My head is just so much more clear it's almost amazing; I literally feel smarter (just bcs I'm here and clear), like I was able to go out and shoot basketball and made almost every shot (when I usually stink...) bcs I thought about the math and angles of ball release and velocity.

I’m 24 years old and have been smoking cannabis daily for 5 years; today I’ve decided to give it up for good.

I’ve had numerous times where I’ve wanted to quit, thought about quitting etc, but cannabis has such a hold on me that I am unable to even take tolerance breaks. Recently, I’ve been getting assessed by a psychiatrist to understand my brain in order to better my mental health; yesterday was my final appointment where we discussed my diagnoses and a treatment plan. Going down the list of diagnosis’, I wasn’t surprised that depression and anxiety were on there, but then we got to the “cannabis use disorder - moderate to severe” and that’s when I finally realized how out of control I had really gotten. 

In my final diagnosis paperwork, he recommended I reach out to local addiction counseling to ultimately stop my cannabis use. He said that I will never be able to get the proper help I need if I don’t quit cannabis and I’ve realized he is right. It’s a crutch, it’s a way to not have to think about my problems, it’s a bandaid solution.

Today I have packed up and given away all my things that relate to cannabis. I’m trying to gather as much information on this as possible and I am so happy to have come across this subreddit. If anyone is on a similar mental health journey, or has decided to quit to improve their mental health, reach out and we can offer mutual support and accountability.",24,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44486132}"

But weed was such an integral part of my youth and most of my friendships that it feels like I lost some piece of myself when I quit. I know I’m much better off without it, but I can’t help missing when it felt good and I was a kid with no responsibilities. And I miss the ritual of rolling a jay or packing a bowl and going outside with my friends or significant other- it was a nice moment to step away and enter a new headspace. Sometimes I’m tempted to try again and see if it has magically gone back to what it was when I was younger, but I know it won’t and it’s a slippery slope to becoming dependent on it again.

I remember laying in my bed, feeling hopeless and high at the same time, reading stories from all the amazing people here in this sub, explaining how weed ruined their life and how they wanted to change for the better.

I told myself that i did not want to look back at my life, regretting that i did not take action and control over my addiction. 

I have been looking forward to share my thoughts here and i have been holding them back for a long time. It seems like most of the people posting on here, just quitted 1-12 weeks ago. That might be because the beginning of sobriety is the most difficult part of quitting. 
I’d like to pay my respect to all the people that just quitted and come here to seek help/explain their story... it takes a lot of power to do so, everybody needs somebody to talk to, and people on this sub are amazing to help each other.

All the time we spend on weed , needs to be spend on doing something else. Thats what i have experienced... doing nothing just drives me crazy and gives me to much time to think about smoking. 

But everybody is different, there is no recipe for sobriety.

Weed turned me to another person. I am 21 years old, and used to smoke as the first thing in the morning, thoughout the Day multiple times and as the last thing before going to sleep. The habit turned me into a bad person, and in the end i could not look myself in the mirror without feeling bad. I did not smoke weed, weed smoked me. It took my soul away. I remember one time i was on a trip and i lost my weed, i noticed that sobriety was like what being high used to be for me in the beginning when i started to smoke weed. In the end of my addiction i would not feel any type of way when i smoked weed, it was pointless. Being high 24/7 is pointless. I felt more fucked up / High when i was sober lol. I wish i had the mind set to control my smoking, and to this day i still try to convince myself that i am capable of doing it. But i am not, and that is why i am here. (Anyone in here that actually succeeded with that?)

After i quitted cold turkey, i started to feel even worse. I had to seek proffesional help, and so i did. It helped me a lot, but i still felt a lot of pain and anger inside of me. I tried to deal with the pain by allowing myself to feel sad, and i tried to deal with the anger by going to the gym. There is a different recipe for everyone. 

I am able to sit in a room with my friends while they pass the joint around, it does not bother me. I still miss being High tho... listening to Music, eating snacks, laughing at funny stuff. I miss this so much. But in the end i remember what i felt like while smoking in the end. 

Let me tell you one thing i was wondering about 300 days ago, “Will i ever not miss being High?” No you Will always miss that feeling. You just have to live with it. Its tough, but its true.

What works for someone in this sub, might work for you, and it might not. But i guarantee you that the worst thing you Can do to yourself if your Reading this while being High, is not just quitting and trying out different things to make you sober. It might take a few attempts, but eventually you will get there.

Sometimes during work I get these mad cravings, especially when someone pisses me off my brain first goes to ""let me smoke a j so I can calm down"". I still have troubles eating and I usually plan my meals around the time I can smoke. I HATE IT! Weed has so much control over me that I need to plan my day around when I smoke.

I’m now 22, first started smoking at 18, at first it was amazing it made everything better but overtime I became dependent on it where I “have” to be high 24/7 just to feel normal. I can’t even eat, sleep or even just play video games without constantly worrying about when’s my next high? Or if I had enough for the night/week.

   It’s real sad that I can’t live life without always thinking about getting high in the back of my head. I’ll feel extremely motivated in the mornings before work and even at work I convince myself that today is the day, but when I get home from work my mind completely changes. Some how everyday I convince myself that I don’t need to stop. 

  I know I need to stop and I really want to but I just can’t. I don’t even like getting high anymore I just get high to feel normal. My longest break was 2weeks and I felt great, the best I’ve ever felt the past 4 years. But somehow even after feeling my best I still convinced myself it’s ok to keep smoking and 1 joint won’t hurt but I always fall right back to smoking 24/7


  I realized over the years I have an addictive personality and for that reason I never started vaping thankfully. Otherwise I would have a nicotine addiction as well. At this point I’m just tired of this vicious cycle. I’m tired of constantly lying to myself. 

   I realize I am addicted to weed, and I still can’t manage to quit for good. I really want to change for the better and change my life around and it starts with me being in charge of my life. I’m tired of being a slave to this drug and I’m scared I’ll never be able to change. If you got this far I appreciate you. Just needed to get this off my chest.

I’m proud to report that 101 days ago I ran out of weed, and made the decision not to get more. I packed up my weed paraphernalia, put it in the storage unit (out of my home), and started quitting cold turkey.

A lot of the posts in this community are from people who have just started their departure for cannabis. They are often a few days or a few weeks in, and struggling. The struggle is real. The first several weeks is hard, and the next couple months may not immediately bring you the clarity/sharpness you were hoping to achieve. But I’m here to tell you that good things come to those who struggle through the hard part.

After over 3 months into it, life gets much better. I still have cravings, yes. But they are easy to resist. all I have to do is remember the unhappiness, lethargy and fuzziness that came from being so stoned for so long, and I remember I’m making a great choice. 

If you’re in the “struggling” phase still, please remember that you are also making a great choice. Every day you are struggling with weed withdrawal is a day full of good decisions. The dividends paid from these good decisions may not have arrived yet, but they will come.

One interesting thing, back when I had yet to quit and was telling people I was thinking about it, I found that no one really saw my weed use as problematic and thus they did not encourage me to quit. I had to encourage myself.

But now that I’ve been off weed for 3 months, when I tell these same friends “I’ve been off weed for three months” …. Their reaction is usually “that’s great!” Once I’m on this side of it, they can see it is clearly a good thing and become more supportive.

So yea! You should Quit weed, I recommend it. Quitting weed is much awesomer than being high constantly. Take it from a guy who goes by “dongservice”.

I'm 485 days sober from weed today. I smoked for about 25 years; since I was about 15 or so.

In that time I made many half-hearted attempts to stop - they all failed until now. One of the biggest questions I had and I know many others do as well is how do I do this? How do I successfully quit?

Well I think that is an individual thing and in my opinion something one must figure out for themselves by pealing away the layers of addiction and through a lot of analysis and introspection. This is what happened for me...

From a young age I started experimenting with drugs, almost exclusively alcohol and weed. Weed quickly became a daily thing and alcohol was constantly there and gradually became very close to a daily thing as well before I quit in 2018.

From the time I started weed until the time I quit I always had this little voice inside me telling me I shouldn't be doing this. I learned to ignore that voice. In my mind there was a lot at stake if I had to stop. It was a way I socialized, it was a way I relaxed after a hard day (all days were ""hard days""). It was a part of my life and lifestyle. It was a lot to leave behind and until a year or so ago I never had the right mind set to make it happen for real.

In the past I never had my head in it. In the back of my mind I always knew I'd be going back - I wasn't being honest with myself. In order to stop I had to start really believing in my ability to stop and my ability to change my life. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever done and it took a lot of work. I had to become my own psychologist.

In order to live a sober life I had to accept and fully believe in myself being a sober person. That means I had to accept that I could no longer get stoned or drunk - ever. I could not take that short-cut escape route to hide from my problems and that was hard. I agreed that for now on I would face whatever life had to offer (or not) head on - fully aware. It meant developing new coping skills and strategies, something I didn't do as a teenager due to my weed and alcohol use. It meant facing all my weaknesses and character flaws and be willing to take steps to fix what I could and improve where I could.

It was hard to commit to adopting a new life style and really becoming a sober person - I became a sober person in my mind before I did in reality. In the years preceding I had learned enough knowledge to know what to expect. I wasn't going to be well for a long time and I had to deal with that on top of everything else, life would continue on and wasn't going to become magical and a breeze just because I stopped weed. Life is hard but its harder when you are an addict.

485 days later things are much better. My brain functions better - I remember things. I can think on the spot more easily, my overall stress levels are ways down. Life is more stable and peaceful. The highs aren't as high and the lows aren't as low. I've got boundaries setup and I know I can't use weed or drink ever again (unless I want to go back to where I was). This is a reality that I had to accept and know it was the way things had to be if I wanted to change my life and I wanted to change my life so badly. I was sick of letting myself down for all those years.",226,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45983458}"

I've spent the last two days wrecking myself over this but discovered the subreddit and honestly hearing everyone describe how depressing quitting weed is made me want to share my short story.

My son was born 7 days ago, my partner initially strongly advised me against quitting weed as to put it ""I can't do the baby and you going through withdrawal"" at the same time. 

This fucking hurt, I wanted her to say to me ""If you bring weed into the house again you're out"" or some other ultimatum which would make me quit weed.

Had a break down and realised that I'm the only one that can do this and I have to stop thinking about others support, thankfully I've went to her and said all this and she has changed her mind now and is fully supportive of me quitting.

Battling the depression, loss of appetite, unable to sleep, feel like I always have a fever and all the other symptoms that come with chronic usage cold turkey.

I'm really hoping that by the end of week 1 I'm starting to feel normal again but all my friends smoke so trying not to relapse is going to be hard.

Battling this and at the same time trying to make my new born son happy is tearing me the fuck up inside but I hope things will get better, of course he has no idea of whats going on and he probably never will but I just wanted to get this all of my chest in the hopes that I can post again in a week or two saying everything has got better.",45,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.565628}"

I’ve come to realize this past year, that something I used to curse and swear was the death of me has become something I’m so thankful for, but the transition makes me ashamed. 
I grew up with parents who didn’t like each other in the slightest and were bound together financially, but never and i mean never did they try anything else but their hardest to make the most for my siblings and I. But I used to not realize how much my parents sacrificed for me; their time, money, energy, love, and spirits entirely into making sure their kids succeeded. As I went through my later teenage years I began to naively believe that everything that was wrong with me was my parents fault for not doing it (raising me) right. And I adopted a FAT victims mentality where I swore I wouldn’t be like my father and wouldn’t have the bad parts of my mother either. This past year though, and I guess the sentimental nature of thanksgiving had me sitting alone with my thoughts and made me realize just what a royal fucking git I’ve been. My parents are growing up too, and I’ve only got so much time with them. But it’s fucking weed, with everyone it’s always weed. Like I look at all the things my parents do that frustrate me and it ultimately boils down to them caring about me and wanting the best for me and I can’t even look them in the eyes and tell hem the truth about where I’m going or what I’m doing. And the truth is mom and dad, I’m a husk of the person you raised, I’m so weak right now, I’ve become everything you don’t want me to be, and everything I don’t want me to be; dependant on a drug to feel okay… just okay. It’s not like I get high, it just helps me think straight now and not feel in a fog or just anxious and depressed that nobody wants anythin to do with me when I’m not high or being the life of the party. I just want to make my parents proud guys. I want to make myself proud. I want to be able to look in a mirror and like what I see and not have to lie or live a double life in the shadows. When my parents time does come for them to leave this earth I wouldn’t/won’t be able to live with myself if I keep pissing away this blessing they’ve given me. I feel such an extreme sense of guilt when I’m indulging in weed and living a secretive stoner lifestyle. I’m fucking broke, depressed, don’t talk to anyone new, and am just hopeless with no light in the future. I began to realize this isn’t living, this isn’t what’s going to get me romance, or passion, or help me reach any of my goals. Weed financially crippled me, fucks my eating habits, kills sleep habits, ruins my social skills and I’m a very sociable person, and it sucks the life out of me I have no desire to accomplish anything hard I just want to chill snack and float thru. It fucking infuriates me and I’ve tried to quit for myself before but today’s one of the first days I’ve realized it’s ruining so much more of my life than I’d imagined. Every day I’m stoned and agitated and skip exercising and spending time with my family is another day my mom and dads heart would break if they saw what I was experiencing and going through. They’d do everything to help me feel okay again but I won’t even help myself. And I’m too ashamed to ask for help or even let them know the suffering I’m going through. So this time, and hopefully for a finale, I can use these feelings as reminders as to why I need to stop smoking and be the person I’m meant to be and make those around me proud. So I can look in the mirror and look my parents in the eyes and tell them who I am and mean it and believe it and act it out.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56642926}"

I now there's lot of stoner out there who will say that it's a good shit, if you can't handle it don't do it, well it's not about how good you are when you are stoned, it is about making your life worth living instead of being stoned in one place all day everyday 

Also when I used to smoke weed I noticed that my brain power (thinking ability, decision making, inertia, laziness, skin quality, hair quality was sooooo bad)

Now I think I have recovered 100% (by meditating daily for 20 mins)

I was smoking every day and drinking almost every day but now I have stopped both with the exception of a celebration wine once (a nice expensive one) but I had no urge to smoke when I did it amazingly!

Most noticebly has been the change in my face. I always looked young for my age (41f) but I was looking so run down with permanent bags under my eyes and sagging skin. I had a double chin I was very self-concious about, but I'm happy to say it's gone and I've lost weight without even trying. 

My mental health has also improved greatly, I feel fresher and more awake in the morning and I no longer have a frazzled anxious feeling throughout the day. At night when the cravings would normally hit me, I have been replacing my night time smoking with playing computer games. It helps to have a distraction that I can really engage in till bed time. 

Just thought I'd share my achievement as I haven't gone this long without smoking in years.",26,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9035935}"

Guys, I’ve been trying to quit carts and I’m on the 5th or 6th day. It has been absolutely horrible but I know I cannot go back to smoking. I’m only 17 and used carts daily for about 4 months. My withdrawal symptoms are: chronic and extreme anxiety and fear- paranoia and fear that something bad will happen- vivid dreams but they don’t wake me up. I sweat a LOT when I’m asleep- I burst into tears and snap easily and also get angry and emotional really quickly- I’m just tired, I won’t go back but I wanna know if it is possible that I will never recover? 
Can someone help? Am I gonna be OK in a month or so?

After my dad passed away I found myself drinking even more trying to get the flash backs out of my head and realized I had a problem.  I found a therapist and have been sober from alcohol for about 5 months.  

&#x200B;

One of the things that I contribute to that success was weed.  I started smoking about three years ago after I opened a business and was having a hard time turning my head off at night.  I thought it would also help keep the drinking down which it did at times but I ultimately needed to remove alcohol from my life period.  For the last three years I've been a daily weed user only using in the evening and weekends and have managed to remain very productive run my business and my home life without any issues.  However, for the first time recently I've been wondering if I'm still masking my problems with weed.  Now that I haven't been drinking I'm seeing myself with this consistent habit and wondering if I've formed an addiction around it.  So I decided to discuss it with my therapist and attempt to break from it. 

&#x200B;

 As soon as I did my blood pressure spiked up (I have had high blood pressure but controlled with meds the last few years) it was almost like I was more calm with it in my system and now that its not my body is having a hard time adjusting.  I realized my anxiety level dealing with every day is extreme and its starting to give me headaches migraines and body aches like stress in my neck/shoulders that's extremely uncomfortable.  I was about three weeks sober and finally went on auto pilot and smoked a little and felt great.  I gave it a break again for about a week and then we went on vacation with another couple and had a little when we went out to the bars in the evening since I wasn't drinking.  I'm decided I was okay letting myself enjoy that evening with it since I wasn't drinking and I felt relaxed with the group but now that its over I'm having the urge to do so again in the evenings.  I'm fighting with myself that on one hand like anything moderation is the key and if you can't moderate then you should just stop it.  The other part of me says I was doing great without alcohol and usage in the evenings I think its the stigma I see and if others knew they would judge me for it which is an internal issue not the issue with the weed itself.  The other part of me says its not an issue I have a very busy life and if I come home and smoke a little its not a problem.  

&#x200B;

I just keep battling myself on it and just wonder for those that decided to stop what was the reason you decided to stop and what were some of the benefits you saw afterwards?  Did anyone have issues with their blood pressure or increased anxiety and does it get any better?  Addiction runs in my family with drinking and one of the things that helps me stay sober is trying to be the parent I want my kids to be.  My kids are getting older and they are going to start realizing that I smoke in the evenings and is that a problem for me ... I just don't want my kids to see it as a way to make problems go away because they will always be there when you come back but at the same time we all find ways to take the edge off and if I'm still the same person just a little more relaxed given how busy I am with the business and my other organizations I work with so its okay as long as I'm productive and nothing suffers but a part of me thinks maybe thats the addiction side as well.  Just looking for some thoughts based on personal experience if anyone battled the same questions and maybe what they discovered sober or not moving forward ... thanks!",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.51827276}"

How do you guys do it, what makes you persevere through the sweaty palms and the fever and the little voice inside your head telling you that you need to smoke or you're going to go crazy. I already had an explosive episode towards my wife today and I'm just not sure how I can keep going. 

I'm at the point in my life where I don't smoke to get high, I smoke because my body tells me too. Because I feel that I have too, I'm quitting because I don't get any enjoyment out of it anymore and I feel that it's only causing me money problems and anxiety.

But when I put in the effort to stop, I feel worse. I've been telling myself all day, what would it hurt to go buy some more and just keep smoking? Realistically I have been highly functioning adult for 10 years all while smoking and working full time. So is it actually beneficial to quit smoking for me? Of course but how do I motivate myself more? These symptoms I'm experiencing are only going to get worse, hell I haven't even tried too sleep yet....

TLDR: Still had bad withdrawal symptoms (particularly mood swings) at week 5 and felt really discouraged that I was feeling this way weeks after the ""peak"". Be reassured it is normal and you will get through! Go talk to your doctor if you are able to and if it is getting to be too much! <3

I am popping this here for some reassurance for those who are still getting smashed by withdrawals. I smoked both for fun, and to deal with a huge amount of stress in my life at the time. I decided to stop when I felt that weed was giving me anxiety, and when I stopped getting high/it wasn't really fun anymore. I started to smoke daily nearly 2 years ago, and started to smoke heavier and heavier.

Just please note that this is my experience - I understand it is different for everyone!

A while ago I posted my timeline for 20 days of withdrawals.[https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pw2y24/day\_20\_a\_timeline\_of\_withdrawals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pw2y24/day_20_a_timeline_of_withdrawals/)

**Week 3-4 (getting better)** Loss of appetite, dry retching most days, anxiety, and depressive mood swings. WILD TRAUMA DREAMS OF MY WORST FEARS! The anxiety/depression would come in ""spells"" that would last anywhere between 1-8hrs at a time.I am eating super well, sleeping well, and exercising. Since day 10-ish, I have been doing daily journalling, practicing mindfulness, using grounding/breathing techniques etc. I had some full days of clarity without mood swings, and thought I was finally coming out of the other side!

**Week 4-5 (super bad)** Same as week 3-4. Was still retching most days. The swings between depressive moods and anxious moods are honestly wild! And to be honest - a lot worse. I decided to go to the doctors, because these mood swings, and the intensity of them was honestly too much for me to handle by this point. I felt really discouraged that I am at week 5, and it is still this bad. The moods literally felt like being hit by a truck out of nowhere, and became really debilitating.

I know everyone's experience is different. But constantly reading ""oh it peaks between 2-3 weeks and gets better from there"" - well. Wtf is wrong with me if I feel like the mood swings are worse at 5 weeks. OH NO (especially when I don't have a history of depression/anxiety. Before weed, I was a really happy bubbly person)

So I went to the doctors. I am fortunate they were very kind and understanding, and told that having intense withdrawals at week 5 is actually normal. The retching is due to my body being in so much stress from withdrawals, that it is a normal physiological response.They had a psychologist there too that I got to speak that knew a lot about withdrawals, and what my body was doing on a physical and psychological scale. I was also told that yes, the peak of withdrawals is at 2-3 weeks. But that is generally for the physical withdrawals, and the psychological withdrawals are a different story entirely (I know everyone's experience is so different!).

Your brain really can be your worst enemy, and was told that the intrusive anxious thoughts that are relentless is the brain trying to find a short term solution to deal with the fact it doesn't have THC anymore by demonising everything around you. My intrusive thoughts often revolved around ""I'm not normal. I won't be the same. My partner is going to leave me. Everyone is going to think I am crazy"". Especially when I have been giving myself a good fighting chance through talking, exercise, diet, etc.

I was given some medicine to help with the irritability/anxiety, and withdrawal symptoms in general for people going through this. Due to the very low dose, this medication doesn't come with side effects, or withdrawals when you stop it.It has helped me so much. It is not intended to be a crutch, but just to help alleviate the symptoms while your brain is rewiring itself. It has helped with the mood swings so much.

What a relief. I am so glad I went, and happy to be validated because 5 weeks of dealing with these intense mood swings really started to affect my life, and my sanity. If it gets to be too much to handle, it is worth talking to your doctor :)

I am reaping so many positives since quitting - better focus, more motivated, more social energy, more cognitive energy, I feel like I have ""more"" time, positive feelings are way more intensified, better memory, etc

2-3 week taper down to nothing.

1 month taking edible every other day with 'light dose.'

47 days clean.

I definitely feel better at this point. My body doesn't feel like it weighs 10,000 lbs (every day, at least), and I have made some major life changes (my wife and I now live separately - a huge positive for both of us, plus a pretty major decision to stop accepting freelance work as a musician, the only thing I have done for employment other than teaching), and I feel like the pieces are coming together for a better life for myself and my family.

However, my head is shit and it bugs me. I feel like I have a wet towel wrapped around my brain all the time. My vision is pretty junky too, plus crazy tinnitus. I've started meditating in the mornings and my mind feels like a glob of aimless soup. Every so often I have a day where I'll notice brief cognitive improvements (hearing and knowing what notes are, simultaneously seeing everything in a room that's the same color), but generally speaking I feel pretty bogged down.

Anyone have some encouragement who's made it out of this? Particularly after a long PAWS period? When I quit drugs I get FUCKED. Booze, caffeine, pot... no matter what the withdrawal is just a long, hard bitch.

I didn't sweat all that much either, and I felt more refreshed when I did wake up (and someone at work even said I looked different today in a good way)

I have noticed though I was a little paranoid at work today. I dont know if it was because of the weed (or lack of) or if i'm linking new events to old scenarios where i've been hurt. On Friday I was going for food with a lad from work and he invited this girl I like, he said he would wingman for me. But on the day, it seemed so obvious to me (I guess I could be wrong, but I dont think so) that she wasn't interested in me, and seemed interested in him instead. All day today i've not been able to shake the feeling that they might be seeing each other now. Which would be fine of course, I was never with her, but it just hurts that noone I like ever seems to like me back, and everyone around me can find partners so easily.

i just stumbled across this subreddit coming from a finance subreddit where someones sankey showed a large amount of money going into weed every month and therefore someone suggesting this sub. As i spent about the same amount as this random guy (roughly 300€/ a month) on weed i checked out this sub as well last friday and read some of the stories.

Of course i was high when reading this as it was a friday night and what else would you do an a friday night. As i read through a lot of different posts on here i realised that what most of you are describing is exactly the situation i am in.

A bit of background: 

I first started smoking weed around 17, but i would say that until i left school the usage was pretty moderate, even though looking back i see first signs of addiction even back then. I didnt smoke alot and only at nights (mostly with friends, sometimes alone) but it kept at an level of maybe 2 joints a night in a group of 3-4 people. After leaving school and a 1 year stay abroad i moved to a big city in my country (somewhere in europe :D ) and started university. For the first time living on my own meant smoking almost everyday for me. Accordingly my studies in the first year went down the drain, which didnt really bother me too much as the subject back then wasnt really what i wanted to study anyway, but more a chance to move to this city and start at this uni and then figure out where to go from there. 

About one year later a ""friend"" i knew from my year abroad moved to the same city as i lived in and we got a flatshare together. At the same time i reenrolled in uni in a new subject. I am 21 at that time and have been high pretty much every day in the last year. Days i didnt smoke only occured when i was heavily drinking. In said flatshare we smoked everyday all day. We barely went to uni (maybe once or twice a week). When i wanted to quit to get my shit togehter (as i have tried multiple times in the last years) there was always someone close smoking. The flat would smell of weed everyday and of course i wasnt strong enough to obstain. This went on for about 3 years, when i decided i had to move out. I needed a change. Because as you can imagine a stoner flat from two guys in their by then mid twenties war pretty discusting. It got to a point where i would never bring anyone home (not that i knew alot of people to bring anyway). 

So i get my own place in a studentshome where i live on roughly 16 m\^2 for about 2 years. Except for maybe one or two week breaks during exams or the occasional week on a holiday, i got high pretty much everyday. This brought me to the enlightment that i cannot blame others for supplying me, when i even get high everyday when im on my own.

As this flat was tiny and a room in a friends flat became available that was way bigger and in a nice flat i moved in there when i was 27. That was the end of 2019 and i was optimistic about the future. I just started working at a tech company, that hired me even tough i was still a bachelor student (here the system is a bit different than in the us, you can easily study 15 semesters for a bachelor deegree without the university asking any questions). As by then i was also studying engineering in uni (started new again in 2015) i was hoping this would help me stay on track. However i couldnt give up the weed. I still smoked everyday and worked 2,5 days a week in a new job in a pretty ""high"" performer environment. I was able to keep that job until today, even tough i had times when i only slept 2 hours as i was getting high until early morning or even home office sessions where i might have smoked ""on the job"". It has gotten alot worse with corona hitting in 2020. The last 1,5 years me and my flatmate went trough 5g in two days. Every two days. More on the weekends. I noticed that when i smoked with some other casual smokers that those joints didnt do anything for me and i needed more and more.

As most of us i have been lying to myself about fact that i could stop whenever i want. The last years and all the times i ""wanted"" showed me differnt.

Now after postponing exams for years and moving slower than a turtle i am close (4 tests and a seminarwork, so probably 1 ""real"" semester away) to finishing my degree. The company i am working at even offered a Fulltimeposition in a field i am very interested in to me. 

As i am writing this i should prepare for the last exam from the summer term (here they go until october) which happens on wednesday. That is what got me interested in this sub, because ever since corona and uni happening at home i wasnt even able to stop smoking in times of exams but instead just kept postponing everything and even did some tests where i smoked either the night before or had one evening of a break. This of course only leads to very bad insomnia the night before the exams which does not really improve performance. 

I will turn 30 next and have pretty much nothing to show for the last ten years, except maybe a less than average degree that took me forever to obtain. I have never been a serious relationship, my last date is about 3 years in the past. Without the company i am working at at the moment, i wouldnt even know what to do with that degree afterwards, as i am pretty sure that most HR would drop my resume immediatly. 

So i know my only chance and maybe my last chance to get my shit together is now! I have to finish this degree within the next 6months to finally start as a FTE. As this will be alot of work (exams+paper+ new job responsibilites ( changing from QA-Engineer to BackendDev) ) there is no way i can reach any of those goals without stopping the weed. 

I dont really know what the point of all this text is tbh. I just had the feeling i needed to write it down. I smoked my last joint on early saturday morning (around 5am) which was actually just a late friday night for me. However i started Sunday as my fist day without any weed and am on day 2 today. After trying this maybe 5-10 times in the last years and always failing i am hoping that this time i will succeed.  The night sweats the first two nights were pretty bad, as is my stomach at the moment. From times i quit for a few weeks before i know all those symptons are normal. I just never made it past maybe a month to were all of that stops, but instead always went back to weed.

This time i swore myself it will different. I got rid of everything i have related to that. I even ""gifted"" 50€ worth of weed to my flatmate as i simply dont want to have it in my room anymore. Now im am ""hiding"" in my room everynight until my exam on wednesday, but i am scared that i will fall back in old patterns after that, because then the immediate pressure is gone. Usually that brings back the cravings really bad and i say to myself ""one night wont harm"" and wake up 6 months late with another semester down the drain. Do you have any tips on how to avoid that? I am still living with my friend who i like and i cannot expect him to change his behaviour because i find it problematic for myself. The living situation most likely wont change within the next 6 months as it is really hard to find affordable places to live here.

Sorry for all the text, and thank you to everyone who took the time reading it. English is not my first language so please apologise mistakes. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: After almost 10 years on weed (with small breaks) and countless uni semesters down the drain i will finally try to get my shit together before i turn 30 next year. Thank you all for your inspiring stories on here. Lets hope i will have one to share in a few months to come.",1,{'rona': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49664226}"

I’ve been sober for almost two years now. Recently I have been having a lot of thoughts about smoking. Sometimes I wish I could just smoke a J and relax to watch a movie, or have a funny “stoned” night with my boyfriend, or go out for a huge meal. Just the little things ya know? Anyways, I used to be a 24/7 stoner, I’d like to say it was extremely situational given what was going on in my life at the time and i just got carried away. Smoking made everything worse and my life is so much better in so many ways without being stoned all the time. Quitting was by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and it’s pretty annoying that I still have these desires. I miss the days when i first started smoking and it was only once in a while, and purely just for fun. Part of me wants to think that because of my whole experience, maybe if I tried it this time around that I would be way more cautious of my using habits and not get carried away. But I’ve also been to support groups that have instilled a lot of fear in me. I know the obvious answer is that I should not even try it if I don’t feel confident in myself to control it. But the other half of me thinks…how will I know if I don’t try? Anyways, not sure if I am looking for advice, support, or just needed to vent, but I’d love to have a conversation with anyone who’s been sober this time or longer and hear what their thoughts are.

Fabulous, but I worry about how it will affect my writing: I write a bi-weekly column for a national newspaper and usually my stories are about things that bother me. I write to try and work through things that disturb me, kinda like therapy, it allows me to reappraise things and look at issues from a different perspective, which makes me feel better. But now that my mood is stable, I'm pretty upbeat and detached from things that used to bother me when I was high. I have a deadline in a couple of days and I have no idea what to write about.   
It's interesting, being creative while being sober. I have to find a new approach to creating, I have to find new inspiration now that the impetus for my work is not a negative muse.   
I'd love to hear from artists, how did a sober perspective shape your creativity?",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7333052}"

Reason why is because of health issues that forced me to quit in a very sudden and abrupt way from 10js a day to basically 0.

Reason why I'm typing this is because I need some support, tips, advice, help etc...

I used to smoke weed non stop daily; work, gym, dinner, netflix, middle of night, parties, driving, fuckin airport toilet. I was a daily abuser and a grower as well.

Being forced to stop vs choosing to stop is the same but a bit different in terms of having the ability to smoke again if you relapse.

From this experience I had pros and cons of smoking as the days became weeks and weeks became months of ceasing the devil's lettuce.

Pros:

\-Mental clarity, sharper thinking, energetic, losing weight (no more munchies), feeling better about myself for accomplishing something that i would have had a very hard time doing on my own even though i was forced to stop (life's hard lesson), learning that weed had total control on my thought pattern and reward system mentally basically i had reached a point where food didn't taste good if i didn't smoke up prior, or music didn't sound nice if i wasn't blazed , or playing video games wasn't fun if i didn't have a joint by my side.

Cons:

dwelling , anxiety, depression

How am i tackling the cons ; I started seeing a therapist.

Depression was being masked by weed and getting blazed. A series of tough hard lesson from 2019 forward started my depression from losing my business to a failed economy in my country, to catching covid in 2020 (it was hard for me since i had shortness of breath, fatigue, lower back pain, etc... but i recovered pretty well ), to wars i had witnessed when i was young etc... so the build up of these negative things always pushed me to weed to help relax and take the edge off.

However in the past 3 years my abuse skyrocketed from 1 joint a day to 10-15 a day, and recently again life slapped me in the face with some poisoning that forced me to stop, so i can recover, and recovery might take 1/2 years. I'm already 4 months out and happy i stopped but the memories haunt up in my head , seeing my friends blaze up sometimes pushes. me down the rabbit hole of dwelling and makes me sad cause i miss it. I know that i am better off stopping but its like a voice in my head that pulls me down and kicks me to remind me that life was better before.

I also discovered with my therapist that anxiety was closely building up during my abuse . Instead of relaxing as it did help me before, i noticed a pattern prior to my poisoning where smoking weed would make me agitated, hyper, and anxious. So as well a good point to stop.

The problem i have is the dwelling, and depression that have surfaced in a very negative manner. I started medication for depression and it is helping. But I want some advice and support from members here to help me stop dwelling about these moments and memories about blazing up so i can focus on my recovery and getting better.

I truly never understood depression before and now after experiencing it in a such a manner is when i finally understood why so many people get suicidal or are always sad. I haven't reached that point but i am getting a taste of what being depressed means.

I feel like those people in a rehab institute who are trying so hard to remove their addiction.

Here is what I want to accomplish and improve upon. What are some things you want to achieve with a sober mind? Let's talk,"This last month has been insane. All the trauma/insectaries or whatever you wanna call it that I have burred with weed has come to the surface. 

Yesterday all I could think about was smoking but luckily I am headstrong this time and I'm over it. I've smoked for 10 years and the first time I wanted to quit was 8 years ago!!! I have been dealing with addiction for fucking years. It is time to move on. Even if I relapse, mentally I am making massive strides to move passed being a stoner and staying in my comfort zone. Marijuana is an amazing thing but in the wrong hands, it allows you to escape your responsibilities and stay in your comfort zone which brings on depression and eventually anxiety has time passes you by. 

I'm going into month 2 and this is what I want to do

1. Continue working out consistently 

2. Take my diet more seriously - I have family visiting in 2 months and I want to be in amazing shape for when they come. Working out is fun but eating right is tougher. 

3. Network career wise - Part of the reason why I smoke is because I get anxiety knowing I am not in the right career. I know what I need to do. I have an amazing personality and I can network. I need to step out of my comfort zone, grow a pair, and find my next venture 

4. I need to connect with friends/family - I have neglected them for so long. I gave myself a month to do nothing but now that is in the past. I need to call friends and spend more time with family. It's go time. Even if I don't live up to what I envision in my brain right now, at least I can take some baby steps towards it. 

5. Develop a schedule. Humans are meant to have a schedule. I need to wake up at a specific time and do the same thing over and over. I need to regulate my sleep and start to figure this out. 

That's it. Don't want to add too much since I want to keep it simple. I gave myself a month of being depressed and sad and this next month is going to be focused on *trying* to be who I want when I am sober. I might fail and that's fine, but these are month 2 goals. I want to hang out with people and not spend so much time at home wishing things were different and spending time on my phone. It's ok I ""wasted"" 1 month doing that. It was necessary to get my mind sober. 

Fuck being a stoner. It's an amazing ""drug"" but I have abused it so badly I have lost ALL right to ever use it responsibly ever again. Total sobriety is what I need. I can't moderate. I can't smoke. I only need to be sober. That's it. 

Time to grow up. Let's do this. It's month 2, let's fucking go. It's time to become who I've wanted to be. I've lived in a shell for a decade. I have ""wasted"" time. This is my growth period. People come out of their shell at different times and this is my time. I will give myself 1 months of doing whatever the fuck I want AS LONG AS I DIDN'T SMOKE. 

I forgive myself for spending years under the spell of Mary Jane. I love myself and I forgive myself. It is time to grow up and move on. I love me

I don't even want to look at my phone anymore, I have to resist the urge to smoke and cut off a friend at the same time. I smoked for 8 years and known him for over 3 years and I admit I was pretty abrupt when I stopped calling him but I simply won't have any weed around, I don't need temptation like that in the first place. 

I tried to explain that I'm going sober and he started telling me about his hook up with herbal incense mixes (also sold as ""legal highs"" in our country) and other trash that I certainly won't put in my body, no one should ever touch any of that, not even listen to people that suggest it. He keeps offering lower prices and says if it's because of testing/legal trouble we'll work this out, but I don't want to work with him on anything anymore. The problem is that we also smoked a lot together so he was kind of a friend but since we never met without exchanging money and had nothing to talk about aside from the local situation with weed/cost and had nothing in common except police paranoia I realized he's more of a dealer and I don't owe him anything so I think it's about time to end contact with him, even if it's rude.

I want to be actually sober, I want to get serious about my job, maybe even career options that I never even looked at before and I fear switching to something else would turn me right back into the not-giving-a-shit person that I was before I quit. I also don't drink and with me not smoking unfiltered tobacco in joints anymore I even got out of the habit of smoking 1-3 cigs a day pretty easily. I really don't want to ruin this by abusing another substance or even going back to weed and the insane spendings and laziness that came with me smoking over 2 grams a day. 

I'm not the occasional type, I simply couldn't control it and I know I won't be able to if I relapse. 

He sometimes would just give me more weed than I called him for only to say that over X amount it's cheaper so it's only a few bucks more for me. I thought that this was useful so It came to a point where I'd buy ridiculous amounts of weed to get the price on the gram down, which was the stupidest thing I could do because I then smoked even more and spent even more. This was generally what he preferred, I remember when he messaged me 2 minutes before we were suppoed to meet (I was already there) saying someone else is ""coming for more"" so  I should go home and I was like wtf. Now he's acting like I'm a pussy or even breaking some form of agreement by not coming at all. With me signing off that's a few hundred bucks not going to him every month so I guess he tries to keep me as ""friend"" (more as customer) which I feel is messed up. I won't have this anymore and this sub and reading the experiences of others has helped me a lot.

Writing this because I saw another post here on a dealer reaching out (positive) and wanted to share my own experience. Trying not to rant but it's been negative to say the least.

For people in recovery, it is helpful to use the acronym H.A.L.T., which stands for Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. You should do your best to avoid getting too hungry, angry, lonely, or tired as these are all very powerful stressors and therefore triggers for drug use. I was SHOCKED because at the time I heard this, I was without a doubt experiencing one or more of those things at any given time. It was a slap in the face for me to realize how little care I had for myself, and how I was putting the ""need"" to smoke before my own needs of nutrition, rest, emotional wellbeing, and social health.

For me, it has been so helpful to have a simple acronym that I can use to make sure I am taking care of my basic needs, especially when I am starting to feel the urge to relapse. Could I try talking to a friend about my day instead? Could I make a tasty and satisfying snack, or do something to help me decompress? This acronym has been a great tool for me.

I'm a first year PhD student studying math right now. I smoked pretty much everyday for around 3 years while I was getting my undergraduate degree, and I started trying to slow down with weed near the end of my undergrad when I realized that I couldn't sustain my habit with my desired career path. I started to actually get serious about trying to quit once I started my masters degree. During the first year I repeated a cycle of stopping for around a month, starting again in moderation, beginning to slip into excessive use, and quitting again. I successfully quit during the summer after my first year and have not smoked since.

I thought that my communication and problem solving abilities would improve as a result of quitting, and I am certainly doing better than I was when I was smoking daily. On the other hand though, I feel as if I was actually thriving a lot more during that first year in graduate school where I was in a constant cycle of trying to quit. When I wasn't smoking I would throw myself into my work and I was also collaborating a lot with my fellow graduate students. Now it seems like I can't interact with anyone for more than about 30 minutes at a time before strong anxiety starts to settle in. I also find myself struggling a lot more with making myself start working. I will sit for a long time wanting to get started, but it feels almost like there's a huge mental barrier stopping me. Even now, this isn't work obviously, but I'm having to take small breaks from typing to sort of ""release the pressure"" building up in my head.

I also just felt smarter for some reason when I was smoking moderately, I now have a constant anxiety telling me that I'm an idiot and that my brain is damaged. I also feel like I can't properly relate to my fellow graduate students, it seems like they all have always been studious, whereas I was going a lot more wild during my undergraduate. Not only was I smoking daily, I also drank to excess on a lot of weekends and regularly used a few other drugs (By the time I started masters, I was done with all of this except for the weed and a little bit of drinking). This all makes me worried that I have slowed my mind and squandered some of my potential, so that creates anxiety, and I also feel like I am hiding my past from my new math friends. For some reason this didn't bother me when I was in the process of quitting, but I am painfully aware of it now.

I also feel like I have lost all of my friends that I hung out with during that time. (I'm doing graduate school at the same place as my undergrad). I don't use any illegal drugs anymore, and I very rarely drink now, with about 3 drinks as my limit (Although like an idiot I formed a habit with cigarettes shortly after quitting weed, I just feel like I need to be smoking something). It now seems like my friends from that time view me as boring, and a killjoy. My sex drive also took a dive once I started trying to quit, and it has not properly recovered since, I haven't had sex in about 2 years now, purely for lack of trying. I feel so lonely and I wish I could just find someone to relate to. I feel like I am between worlds, too boring for party people, but with a past too dirty for straightedge people.

 Now recently I have just been thinking about that first year of my masters degree when I was starting to quit. My social skills were at an all time high, I was working incessantly without feeling tired, my sex drive was still intact, and I had people who I actually hung out with outside of school, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment with how much I had slowed down smoking. Now I am no longer getting high, but I feel like I have lost so much more. I don't know if quitting weed is the cause for my current weak mental state, and I also know that when I was smoking daily I was pretty much a basket case, but I have recently been thinking about smoking again more than I have in a long time.

I've been reading posts or here and stopdrinking all morning to try to stop thinking it's okay but I think it's having the opposite effect at the moment and making me obsess over it... What do you do to deal with a strong craving? Maybe I should go on a long drive or hike or something, just get outside and away from it, it's a nice day for once.

I'm 33 now, I smoked almost daily from 18 to 24. After that, and many failed attempts, I quit. The withdrawal was a bitch, all of the ugly symptoms, but got through it and stayed clean for about six years. Then I thought I could handle a joint every once in a while. BIG mistake. At first I did okay, only smoking occasionally, but after a couple of months I was right where I started.

I was lucky, I quit for months at a time and never experienced anything close to the withdrawal I had six year back. But that also gave me the confidence to think I can basically leave it whenever I want, which made me go into de cycle of quitting, relapsing, quitting again, relapsing once more. This has been going on for a couple of years now.

And now I'm entering the danger zone: that moment when I don't feel addicted but feel I could go for a smoke because it's under control. I'm not gonna do it though. Weed makes me unmotivated, lazy and withdrawn. It hurts me physically and shuts me down emotionally. It takes money from my pocket and makes me live a dull life. It affects my relationships and my social skills.

Life is so much better now. Work is going great, I made up with my girlfriend, I'm exercising a bit more. But I know this is the time I have to be the most vigilant of my sobriety, because it's easy to think I have it under control, have a single joint and be on square one in no time.",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4112161}"

I've been smoking almost daily for 5+years with only a few short t-breaks inbetween.
My realtionship with food has always been kinda difficult, I'm extremely skinny and always had issues eating enough, especially when I'm stressed. Weed has always helped me in that regard. 

So, I just started studying at University and quickly noticed that I had a lot of brain fog and trouble concentrating on my work. The realisation hit me that I needed to quit if I wanted to make it through. Im now on day five of not smoking and I've already lost 2 kg, which is a lot for me. The stress of being in a new environment plus withdrawals makes it almost impossible to get food down. 2 days ago I almost passed out because I hadn't been able to eat anything the whole day. I feel weak and malnourished but the thought of eating something still makes my stomach turn. 

I can deal with the other withdrawal symptoms, but I would be very thankful if anyone had some tips on how to get my appetite to a level where I can at least function normally.

If you're stuck in the limbo of the junk wiring every thought of yours into making you bow to it, just know that the desire dies down eventually and you'll be GLAD you went through those turbulent days when the pull of the junk was so strong.

I don't think i need to visit this room anymore. A big THANK YOU to you lovely people. Couldn't have done this without you.

As for anyone still struggling, keep coming here when you feel weak and BE KIND to yourself for the first few days.

BUT I finally stopped about a week ago and boy am I feeling good. Sleep sucks but I’ve definitely noticed a jolt of confidence and energy that I didn’t have during that 30 day break. Part of that is because I am way more active nowadays. I have a big social circle that I put together and I am hanging out with people almost every day other than Monday and Tuesday.

You’ve gotta keep yourself busy when you are quitting both because it makes it easier to give into temptation but also you may not notice much of a difference if you are still laying about and keeping to yourself.

2021-10-09 23:22:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q504vu/day_10963_years_today_reflections_over_the_whole/,Day 1096(3 years today) - reflections over the whole journey & check in thread,"Hello everyone! I'm just going to start out by saying this is going to be a really long post, so if your attention span is shot(like mine was) you can save this for later OR you are more than welcome to just leave a comment on how you are doing and if you have any general questions. I have been exactly where you are - feeling so anxious, scattered, scrolling this subreddit looking for answers. Looking for things to make you feel better about the weird way you feel now(without weed) and all of the weird, lesser known symptoms that come with quitting.

So much has changed in the past 3 years. I was so scared when I first created this account. I was paranoid to tell anyone what I was going through. So many people told me that ""its not that bad"" and ""You should be 100% normal in 3 months"" . I swear I felt worse on day 60 than I did on day 1. I felt better in week 3 than I did until month 6. I have felt so frustrated and down all the way into year 2 for a day or two(for no other reason than PAWS - Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome), than many days during month 8.

Progress in quitting is hardly ever linear and that is frustrating. However progress in your mentality(being as positive as you can) is something you can always rely on during this process. Your thoughts will so often betray you and shout negative things about you and your progress. I still have days where my thoughts are ugly but it is 99% less than the first 6 months of quitting.

I am posting this here today because, in my opinion, I feel like today may have been the most normal day(and maybe best?) I have ever had in 3 years, maybe even in 10 years. There are many benchmarks I have used to measure my progress - days sober, how long I can read a long article without picking up my phone or being distracted by something else, how loud my tinnitus is(yes this CAN be a part of quitting), how long it takes me to fall asleep on a normal day, how throbby my heart/pulse feels(not related to heart rate - which normalized after about 3 months with the aid of regular exercise), how long I can tolerate a conversation for something I do not care for, how long I can meditate at a time, how long I can go without touching my phone, how long I can be bored and be okay with it, how much time I am spending playing video games, but last and certainly not least - how quiet is my mind as I walk back from my car to the house each day after coming home from work. Can I appreciate the rustling trees, the falling leaves, and moon?

With all of that \^\^ said. You will drive yourself crazy if you try to check these benchmarks all the time and its hard not when you first begin. So I would recommend limiting ""checking in on yourself"" for at least the first 6 months.

Today has been so great and normal because I did nothing special today. I slept in until 10 am, I cleaned my room, did some laundry, changed my oil, and went to the gym. Not anything was particularly exciting or fun per se, but as I parked my car and walked back to the house... For the first time(that I can recall) my mind was perfectly silent, I wasn't thinking about what needed to happen next. My tinnitus was so quiet that I could hear the squirrels and birds quarreling near by. I was able to appreciate how beautiful the sunset was. I was completely in the moment and content with just walking back to the house. It was so surreal and serene that I started crying a little and got goosebumps because I did not think it was possible to EVER feel this way again after the hell I put my body through by smoking so much and so often.

I am posting this to tell you - Yes - you will eventually get it all back one day if you take care of yourself mentally and physically. Yes! You will feel normal again. Yes! You can get through this. Yes! It is worth putting all of that hard work into yourself. Yes - you will need help throughout your journey(there are so many wonderful people here to help you). Yes - you should try to involve at least 1 person you know IRL to help keep you accountable.

I would like to close by saying - I am proud of having recovering from being an addict. I grateful for feeling as awful as I did during the beginning because it gave me such a better understanding of how bad some people have it WITHOUT doing any drugs at all. I love having been through all of this because I am a better human being and so much more compassionate towards all people. I never would be where I am right now(happy, content, a really good job, and most importantly in control of my mental health) without having been through this hell and without the help of all of the wonderful people of this subreddit.

Few days ago i got baked, and when i went to bed i flopped down on the bed, and felt my best friend under me when I landed. Poor guy seemed alright, was running around and acting normal. The next day, however, he was obviously out of it. I made a vet appointment, but wasn't able to get him in until today.

Turns out me landing on him caused his bladder to get blocked, and over the course of the last two days his kidneys swole up to twice the size. Sadly, by the time i got him into the veterinary hospital, they told me the options were either to perform a procedure that wasn't guaranteed to work, which was gonna cost me 2-3 grand minimum, or to put him down.

The hardest decision of my life was telling them to let him go. There's no way i was going to be able to afford the procedure when i have a hard enough time making rent, and they need payment before they start. None of my family is in a position to help either.

So I held him in my arms as they put him down. He's going to be cremated. He was only a year and a half old. I've never been so fucking upset. I can't go 2 minutes without breaking down. I killed my best friend, because i was too high to have the awareness to check before i flopped on my bed.

So I'm done. I'm selling all my glass. I don't know if it will help, and i don't know if it's even the reason for my mistake. But if it puts me into a state where I'm putting loved ones at risk, then fuck that.

Idk if this is the right place to post. Hell, i don't even know if my thought process makes sense. Maybe I'm just trying to find an easy scapegoat to cope with an unavoidable accident. Either way i feel lost, and I'm hoping to find some guidance

That made it easy to excuse not holding myself accountable taking action and addressing them instead of hiding from them. 

Since quitting weed almost a month ago I've had a challenging couple of weeks. 3 people I know died (2 with children...), income dipping pretty hard, problems with housemates, other crap. Recently turned 34 and really struggling with feeling like I've wasted time, potential and feeling like a failure. Struggling to forgive myself and treat myself with compassion, feels like an underdeveloped muscle I've got to train.

Weed made it easy to just delay thinking about the changes I knew I need to make. Made it easy to stop trying. Even though I've had some real challenges (bipolar, bad childhood etc.) I've been hiding behind a ""victim"" mentality and using that as an excuse to run from my problems and hide under my weed blankie. I struggled 'forcing' myself to commit to actions, fall into procrastination and hopelessness. Find myself giving up way more easily than I'd like.

I really want to change my mindset away from this fear and victim mentality to taking responsibility for my actions and stop running from my problems.

I've stopped before for 6 weeks so I know whats coming and i'm not looking forward to it at all.

By quitting, i'm hoping to be able to socialise a lot better. Without trying to sound too pathetic, I started smoking when I was 18/19 because I broke up with my girlfriend and couldn't handle what I was feeling. Since then I dont think i've ever been myself. I used to be confident and funny, but now I feel ugly, not good enough for anybody, like the mood killer at parties, like people dont want me around and just pretend to be my friend because they're too polite to tell me to fuck off. Because so much happened so quickly, I honestly dont know if those feelings are because I smoke weed, because I internalised them/was traumatised by the break up, if its true or what. All I know is i've not been happy for a very long time, i'm lonely and just want a nice girl to build a life with. 

I'm really hoping I can start talking to girls and finally have a healthy relationship by stopping. If I can get my old mindset and humour back, then it will all be worth it. Its come at a bad time though really, I made another post earlier today about going out last night and basically being rejected by a girl I like which flared up those insecurities so naturally I've really wanted a smoke all day today to try and get away from the feelings I have about it. 

I'm absolutely dreading the upcoming weeks, and how helpless and low and alone i'm going to feel. But if a few weeks/months of misery is the price I have to pay for a normal, healthy life then I guess its worth it.

I can’t handle the withdrawals anymore.,"So I’m on day 23 and I can’t do this anymore. :( I have no desire to smoke weed honestly but the withdrawls are just too much. I can’t handle it another day. Long story short: I’m 24 years old and smoked 6 straight years heavy every night. I even set an alarm for 3am every night to wake up and smoke a bowl. So I was heavy with it. I’ve never drank or smoked a cigarette in my life so weed is the hardest drug I’ve done. Or that my body has experienced. But 24 days ago I decided to ask my girlfriend of 3 years to marry me and I knew it was time for this new chapter in life to be sober. But around the first week after I stopped COLD TURKEY is when the symptoms started. I was 100% healthy before I stopped. And I work at a pharmacy as a tech and of course always hid my smoking habit from EVERYONE. No one would EVER guess I was a heavy smoker. So the last 3 weeks I’ve been making up stories on why I’m in pain and stuff so my pharmacy staff doesn’t know. They are clueless 

Anyways, I’m on day 23 and at work today my chest got SOOO tight I had to sit on the floor with 2 fans on me and just close my eyes to settle down. (I do work at a VERY busy pharmacy). And my pharmacist (not knowing I’m having weed withdrawls) says I was having a panic attack, which I’ve NEVER had before in my life. I’m a very outgoing and talkative person so anxiety? Pshhh I wouldn’t ever guess I would have that. 

But the chest pains I’ve been experiencing, the NIGHT SWEATS EVERY NIGHT, the depression I’ve gotten, the muscle cramps everywhere, my right arm randomly feeling tingly like under my armpit and rib cage, my blurry vision (I’ve been to the eye doctor last week and he said I have PERFECT vision) and the 24/7 fatigue I’ve been getting is wayyyyyy to much for me to handle anymore. Has this happened to ANY one else here? Please tell me it has. I’m off all weekend and I’m about to say screw it and smoke again JUST to get rid of all these symptoms.

One thing I can't do is drink everyday, it makes me feel shitty, like I can have a class of cider or a rum over ice but not to the point where I get pissed every night - just the thought of that makes me want to puke.

I stopped properly in the last 6 months, oh god the sleepless nights and weird dreams.... 

But something I can't understand for a drug like weed that it is so easy to slip into the everyday habit. How is that with weed so easy to slip into it as a habit once you start it's everyday. I've had a few dabs here and there, making sure not to fall into the habit again - but that will only last me 2 days max, then I'm out of it (from a single g - usually from a Friday to a saturday AFTER I have done my chores/work)

Then I might go weeks without anything, sometimes I think now ooo I'll get a G for this boring weekend I have and play some vidya or relax after a long day out clay shooting. Moderation seems to have been the hardest obstacle with weed, but now I feel I can do it in moderation without ""needing"" it.

For the past two years I’ve consciously struggled with my marijuana addiction, and have been using/unconsciously struggling for almost a decade. Addiction didn’t come at first, it almost never does, but it wasn’t until I almost got kicked out of college for poor grades from almost never attending class when I thought for a split second that maybe weed wasn’t the best thing to use. But no that’s crazy, I was a former straight A student and took honors classes all my life, this semester of sophomore year was just a blip and I could certainly get myself out of academic probation by actually going to class and studying hard! And I did. And I continued to smoke every single day after class. “Piece of cake!” I thought to myself. “I’ll just be a productive stoner and smoke on the evenings and weekends!” Haha ugh, I was so naive in my early years of using. 

Fall of 2019 is when I really started to examine my weed usage in the context of substance abuse. And I tried to quit, I really really wanted to. From Dec. 2019 to now, I have had a shit ton of Day 1’s, have spent countless hours in phone or virtual Marijuana Anonymous meetings, and have written endless journal entries about my difficult and toxic relationship with weed. 

To me this is an insidious drug as it doesn’t immediately take as much as it perceives to give, but rather its effects slowly creep up  until one day you realize the cloud of smoke has gotten so thick you can’t even see what’s in front of you, or rather in my case, a lack thereof. 

Weed has taken far more in my life than it has given me, and yet for years I thought it was the solution to all my life’s problems, and never once thought it could BE the problem. I’ve missed out on way too much time with my family because I was either getting high, rabidly focused on getting my next hit, or unbearably sick from countless withdrawal periods. 

I believe I have officially hit my rock bottom. I’ve obliterated my savings from spending it all on weed, food delivery orders, and from buying random expensive shit when I’m high. I’m a professional in tech, work with Fortune 100 companies daily, have my own car and apartment, and live in a very nice part of town. From the outside I couldn’t possibly be an addict, but here I am. Crying out to the universe for something to save me, just please for the love of god someone help me do something about this god damn monkey addict brain inside of me. The phrase internal struggle doesn’t even describe the half of it. My heart telling my body to “please stop” as my brain justifies “one more hit” is a wildly awful and paradoxical feeling.

Back at the end of January this year I decided to just quit.  There was a crazy blizzard outside and I ran out of weed and the thought of going out in a blizzard for weed seemed so irrational it made me realize I have a problem.

I managed to quit until June when I hurt my back in the gym.  I was so stiff and sore and went to chiropractic but nothing helped.  So after about 5 days of pain I decided to take a toke.  Mind you at this point I was over 6 months clean.  I had stopped counting days.  I just rationalized doing it once.  It did make me forget about my back pain which went away after another day or so.  And honestly. I liked it.  I took a tiny hit and was super high off it.  After that i would then every so often take a hit off a vape pen when hanging with friends or my brother.

So I basically slowly became a regular user again.  I'm still not using as much as I did before.   It's become a daily habit again.  I'm so mad at myself because I went though some crazy withdrawals that I'm scared I might have to endure again now.  At least this time it's only after 3 or 4 months rather than 14 years.  

Then on September 11th my older brother passed away.  He was also an addict but had a serious drinking problem and died from liver failure.

I am one of the few folks who has had moderate success tapering off rather than quitting cold turkey. I'd tried to quit with some success a handful of times but have always over the past couple of years, but would always cave at some point and immediately go back to smoking as much as I could as often as I could.

I think my recent success is attributed to a handful of circumstantial changes and some proactivity on my part. First, I moved away from my family who are all chronic users of weed and/or alcohol. I got a job at a small company that I actually like working for and my bosses have been incredibly compassionate and supportive. I was able to talk to them about addiction and feel safe doing so. They stuck with me even as I made poor choices, and have always been available to talk and listen. I've been going to therapy, which honestly hasn't been as productive as I'd like, but I'm sure it is doing a lot more for me than I realize on the surface. Finally, I was gifted about an ounce of ""weak"" (to appease the automod) weed.

For anyone who is interested in tapering as a means to quit, I tried twice and I'll share my failure and my (current) success. I want to preface this by saying that I don't actually think that tapering is the best way to go. It worked for me this time, but, as you'll read, there was more going on with my brain chemistry than just cutting back on smoking pot.

The first time, I basically would come home after work and smoke as much of this ""weak"" weed as my lungs could handle every night. It was hard to smoke enough to feel how I wanted to feel, and eventually I gave up and switched back to ""normal"" weed. After a few weeks of feeling like garbage, I tried again. The second time, I had just begun taking a prescription medication from my therapist that apparently helps folks quit smoking tobacco. I'm not sure how much that helped me quit. What definitely helped was that I made an effort to do *anything* different when I came home from work before smoking. Even if I only delayed an hour that was progress. I have a dog and would take him for a walk, practice guitar, or make a meal as soon as I got home. For about a week I smoked 2 bowls of the ""weak"" weed a night -- enough to feel some effects and then enough to get to sleep. The first weekend, instead of waking up and drinking coffee and messing around on my computer (which would typically lead me to wanting to just hang out and smoke all day) I left the house and got a coffee at a coffee shop. Since I was out of the house I was able to make a plan to get some stuff done, take my dog out for a walk, and make food when I got home. Then, at the end of the day I'd allow myself to smoke a bowl. The second week I only smoked a bowl a night, and not every night. Throughout this time I'd also begun exercising in the mornings (I'm going to physical therapy due to a work related injury).

I had (and still have to some extent) some insomnia during that time, but my mood was greatly improved in general. It felt good to be doing stuff.

At the moment, my desire to smoke pot is surprisingly low just over two weeks since fully stopping (I did smoke a bowl of the ""weak"" pot on two occasions in the middle of those two weeks while gaming on my computer with my stoner friends, it wasn't particularly enjoyable).

My mood improved a ton the first week I had completely stopped, but this whole last week I've been afflicted with a dreadful melancholy. I can't tell if it is the prescription medication, adjustment to a weed free brain, or what. I come home and don't feel the urge to smoke, but I also have zero motivation to do anything else. I get bored trying to play guitar or video games, and I've been neglecting walking my dog. I keep going to bed at like 8pm, waking up for a few hours in the middle of the night, then getting a couple more hours of sleep before getting up at 5am. I'm cooking for myself and eating better, but somehow it just feels like I'm going through the motions.

Anyway, I just wanted to share what worked for me and acknowledge how lucky I am to have been given so much support to get to where I am. I know so many of you don't have that, and that your struggle will be harder because of it. All I can do is encourage you to keep seeking the support you need, be kind to yourself, and *let* that support come if and when it does.

Honestly dont know what i'm going to do about the boredom and insomnia, i'm in a bit of a dark place mentally as it is, I try my hardest to sleep in as much as I can just so theres less hours in the day to feel sad, i'm dreading being kept awake for so long with nothing to do. I have had breaks from it before ranging between 1 and 6 weeks so I know what is in store.

I started smoking at age 19 and I’m 27 now. I’ve been smoking daily and over the last year it got out of control. I was buying an ounce every 3 weeks or so and spending lots of money on oil cartridges as well. I decided I needed to quit.

I had 6 pre rolled joints stashed away and just about a half of an ounce left. I thought to myself, I’ll just start cutting back until I run out and then I’ll stop. However I’ve been down that road before and it has never worked. I decided to give myself a day to think about it and I woke up and got rid of everything g the next day without smoking. 

Fast forward today, I was out walking in the woods that I usually go to smoke, but I had no weed. Just a bottle of water, my phone, wallet and iPod, or so I thought….I was wearing a cargo pants and reached into one of the pockets and found one of my pre rolled joints  with a lighter. I thought about smoking it because whats 1 last joint? I ended up throwing it all away and continuing on my walk. 

Now, this cold turkey thing isn’t for everyone, but you can do it if you really want to. You have to create a vision for yourself that you can see clearly. For me that vision was creating a nice saving to prepare for the future. With this addiction I’m not able to save much because I smoke so much. Before quitting I thought about just how great of a savings I would’ve had at age 27 if I used that weed money and put it in the bank. That’s really all the motivation I needed, being high is great but being 40+ and having no savings while just spending all my money on weed was a nightmare. Enough for me to quit cold turkey. 

My appetite isn’t there right now, the first two days were crazy sweating, but on the bright side my sleep has not really been affected. Last night I woke up 3 times during the night but quickly fell back to sleep.

Broke six weeks of sobriety yesterday with one hit

Feels bad man

//END TLDR

Made an account to post this, normally only lurk, I've been visiting [r/leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/) on and off for a while ever since I saw a post on [r/trees](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/) years ago.

I've   smoked on and off since I first started, around 18, I'm 27 now.  Deep  down I know  that this is just a coincidence and not causation, but I  was  academically gifted growing up, in things that interested me, and  after I  started smoking weed my life went down hill. Part of my desire  to quit  is wondering if I could become old me again and hop on that  road,  despite knowing it doesn't work that way.

Fuck the wall of text I was trying to write.

It still ended up being a wall of text... Just didn't include the middle.

I   got heavy into smoking again, every day multiple times, etc, at the   start of the pandemic. My girlfriend, now fiance is a heavy smoker.   I've got really bad ADHD, and my memory is really bad, so I try to quit a   lot.

My fiance is a heavy smoker   as well. It helps her with her depression, and suppresses her dreams.   she switched to dab carts to help me out after I asked her to quit with   me.

The reason I was quitting to   get a job, thinking I was going to get drug tested, it took a while  but I  was able to piss clean(three weeks) since then I've been sober,  another  three weeks. Got the call with a job offer the other day after  no  mention of a drug test I was happy.

With   the good news, my fiance started smoking flower again, blunts and  bongs  galore. She wants me to smoke with her again, because I'm more  fun,  less irritable, and at the end of the day just more pleasant to be   around. She respects my wishes, and doesn't pressure me, but we live  together so she still smokes around me.

Yesterday  I fucked up, was really stressed, and couldn't calm down, she's at work   and I'm at home running around cleaning, making dinner, taking care of   the baby, helping the kid with his home work, fixing some electrical  in  the house (replacing an outlet). I grab a little bit of weed, threw  it in  a bong and took a big hit off of it.

Just one, just one fucking hit.

Six weeks down the drain, six whole fucking weeks... Gone, with one god damn breath

I   know it's my fault I broke it. I'm going to keep trying. I didn't take  the second hit, which is normally a huge issue for me because, the days  already down the drain, so you might as well enjoy it, right?

Today's  going well, the cravings aren't hitting as hard as I expected and I  haven't fallen into the ""This time I can manage it"" trap.

I'm going to do a weekly update on here, to keep track of my progress, I figure it'll help me try and be accountable.",2,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42657816}"

And today is one week without. I gotta say, I feel pretty damn fantastic. 

My energy level is pretty low, my stomach is a bit upset and I'm definitely rather cranky. However... My dreams are off the charts. I haven't had a panic attack since quitting (I reached the point where smoking would give me a panic attack about 50% of the time) and I feel way more present in the moment. 

The best part? That indescribable ""magic"" of life is beginning to return to my mind. That same magic that I thought weed was bringing me closer to. It's a red herring folks. You think you are getting closer when really, it's taking you farther and farther away. Not to say weed hasn't given me anything. It has given me many insights.  But with a dull mind I was unable to properly apply those gifts. So now, with a clear mind, hopefully I can start.

I'm having a hard time resisting smoking bc of stress with my relationship...really, it's bc of my addiction and difficulty regulating my feelings during stressful times, but right now the relationship stress is the exact trigger. 

Some days I really want out, but I can't leave right now bc of a shared house lease and shared co-parenting responsibilities (his pre-teen son, but we've been together and co-parenting for the past 4 yrs). I make more money than he does and that's made leaving him to parent alone and figure out housing really hard. plus, I love parenting and I love the kid.  

grown-ass problems, but this is what I'm stressed about and weed is how I've dealt in the past...up until I turned 50 a couple weeks ago. I've been smoking so much since we all moved in together in 2019. and I smoked my way through working from home, all being home together, and home schooling together. 

I moved out once but came back bc I could see how stressed he was trying to do it on his own. 

but I hate how weed is making me dumb. and I love my job and want to be better at it and a good supportive manager for folks i work with in an organization I really believe in. 

I don't want weed to have made me the weakest link.

So I never thought I would do this... this text will be pretty unorganized and I really don't know why I am writing this to people I don't know. It is so strange to me. But I just need to clutter my thoughts...

I'm 22 years old and my journey with cannabis started at a festival when I was 17 years old 5 years ago. I had never smoked before but I had a friend who did use quite frequently so before we entered the festival we smoked a joint. Back then it was more of a cool thing to do since we were so young, plus weed and festivals go hand in hand. I got high for sure, but I never thought much of it. It took a long time to get addicted. That following winter I started using it more and more frequently, still not much, but I could smoke once or twice a month with my buddies just because it was a social thing. 

Then the summer of '19 came around and I was introduced to a new job position which meant that I had a lot more responsibility and more weight on my shoulders. I regularly worked 12-14 hour shifts, never working less than 200 hours a month. This was a kind of stress I wasn't accustomed to so naturally I picked up smoking, but this time it turned in to a daily habit where I smoked every night after work. But at that time, even though I smoked daily, it was pretty much limited to one joint per day since I still lived with my mum and I always had to sneak out to smoke, so doing it multiple times per night and risking waking her up was not an option. She found cannabis in my room a few times, which she got really mad about, but we always worked it out.

This continued to when I moved out to my own apartment last autumn, in 2020. That is when my smoking really took off. No parent to supervise me meant I was free to do whatever the fuck I wanted. The daily smoking took off to 2 joints per day, then 3 joints per day. In the beginning I always told myself I would never smoke during the day cause I hated how groggy it made me, but soon enough I started smoking in the morning as well. 

So from smoking at night just to relax from work, to smoking multiple times a day. It completely changed me because in the beginning I just saw weed as a way to relax. Now it turned in to my identity, I could not even fathom myself doing anything else then smoking weed as soon as I was off from work. My days quickly turned in to doing nothing and that is what brought me here. For the last 10 months or so I haven't gotten anything done. My days have revolved around constantly smoking weed and eating candy. I even broke my promise of never smoking before work, which I in the last 2 months have done nearly every day. I would even wake 2 hours earlier than normal to smoke a joint, then going back to bed before work. I was that addicted to the feeling of being high.

What I think made me this way is emotional triggers, and this might sound weird but music is one big part of what brought me in to smoking weed. Where I live, the whole new wave of gangsta rap has taken over completely where they freely talk about smoking weed and how normal it is. So naturally when I started listening to these artists I adopted the same behaviour and mentality. I even started dealing to finance my own use.

What made me realize I need to stop was the constant pressure of me not accomplishing ANYTHING. Like my ideal day would consist of smoking a joint immediately, going to the store, buy candy, come back and smoke another one, go to sleep. Wake up, smoke a joint, play some games, eat some more, scroll through Facebook and Instagram and then sleeping again. And the days I worked I would be too tired to do anything productive besides showing up for work.

I always had the thought in my head that I would do something productive whenever off days showed up. But when I woke up I would feel so beat up and tired from the night before (consisting of smoking weed) that I didn't have any energy to do something productive. So the cycle just repeated itself. 

So now I am 3 days clean, for the first time in about a year. I tried last year to quit but four days in my mind fooled me that I have no issues because I have a stable income and my job position is not threatened, everything in my life is going good so why do I need to stop? But now, after 2 and a half years of everyday use, I see everyone else my age advancing in their careers and I'm going to stop now for real before it is to late.

I just bought myself a whiteboard and I'm trying to hold myself accountable. Started with daily walks and a minimum of 3L water/day. Trying to keep my diet in check and eat at least 3000 cals per day (I could go days without eating when smoking, because I just slept all day when high), so wasn't really expending any energy. I have actually dropped a few kilograms because of this.

In terms of weed withdravals, I haven't gotten any noticable besides the night sweats. Holy shit I sweat so much. But when I wake up I always drink 1L water and eat a banana to replenish potassium. But how long did your night sweats occur? It is ridicolous how soaked I am when I wake up lol.

I made my first post about two weeks ago about my decision to quit weed for good. The thing is, i am dealing with complex PTSD which involves a lot of anxiety, depression, shame, guilt, nightmares and night terrors, insomnia, suicidal ideation, mood swings and change in the appetite, etc...in general, not at all fun thing to have.  I am aware for quite a while that i have an issue with weed in order to help myself with another issues. I've been smoking for about 18 years with a few half a year breaks. But, i was able to do whole lot of things regardless. Now, i want to change my lifestyle, grab my issues by the balls and deal with them fully sober. Cold turkey worked for me before, but i struggled a lot, so i am trying now with tapering down. I made a plan with my therapist to go down for a joint or two week by week. Now i am smoking 4 to 5 per day ( small quantities, one gram is lasting now 5-6 days, until April it was 1-1,5 days, so i already tapered it down significantly) where the goal is to stop completely on 29th of October, once i come back from a visit to my home country and have a fresh start.

It started when all of my really talented and bright friends at college asked me if I wanted to smoke. I was against smoking until that moment, but I figured if my really smart friends were doing it, then it must be okay. 

Initially I didn't smoke much, probably once a week, but the intervals continued to get shorter and shorter until it was everyday. I still don't wake-and-bake; I don't smoke during the day. I only start around 7 or 8pm. When I smoke, it ruins my night. It ruins every night, and then it ruins the subsequent morning. I stay up too late doing things that aren't productive, even though I should be studying for my college classes. I could be achieving a lot more this semester. I could be a lot happier this semester. I could be more like the person I dream of being every day, but I'm not. 

Part of the problem is that it never ruins my life. I barely get by with the minimal level of success. There have never been any large consequences when this habit is in full force. 

I've ""quit"" smoking before. I always WANT to quit. I've gone as long as 2 months without it, but then I decide that ""maybe I could just do it this one night"". One night turns into two nights, then two nights turn into two weeks, weeks into months, etc. It hurts me, my relationships, and honestly it's a GIANT waste of money, but it's so difficult to quit. And it's so difficult even though those 2 months were GREAT!?! Those breaks are always when I get my mental health back, but I always fall back into my old habit. 

I know that this time I can break through the initial irritation and cravings, but how do ya'll keep at it? Delta 8 has made it so much easier to purchase in my area, so I know it's going to be difficult to keep away. Do the thoughts of trying it again ever disappear?

It took me just couple months to go from this straight edge dude (who honestly was very interested into drugs and was researching them) into a full blown wake up and bake stoner.

I kept making excuses about my smoking habits, I used justify it because I didn't enjoy alcohol and didn't drank much during high school, but man I was smoking A LOT for someone my age.

I used to do tolerance breaks, sometimes a month or two, sometimes couple days, sometimes couple of weeks, but I've noticed one thing about tolerance breaks. I ALWAYS come back smoking harder, smoking bigger quantities and more often. Tolerance break actually increases my weed usage in a long run.

I've done it all I guess, I know more people in prison than free walking ones, I know more dealers and addicts than I know normal people. I don't even know how to talk to normal people, even though I can talk about anything and on many topics, majority of my talks are drug related. It feels weird to talk to normal people, people who look down on you when you mention that you smoke couple of grams a day, all by yourself, that you can roll a joint in less than 5 seconds, people with actual goals and ambitions.

I don't wanna go into that how much I spent on weed during this 7 years period, but what bothers me is what would've happen if I actually spent the 7 years, the resources, etc on another habit, such as gym, courses or anything that's worth instead of the weed.

I'm just bored of lying to people, bored of lying to my parent, bored of arguing at home about it, bored of owing money, bored of looking over my shoulder nonstop while smoking, buying or rolling on the streets, bored of constantly postponing serious life events, bored of feeling like shit on the comedown, bored of feeling like I don't have any energy, bored of sleeping 12+ hours, bored of lying to myself that I'll stop only to call the dealer first thing in the morning, bored of hiding shit in my underwear.

The only thing that I was buying for myself was weed, nothing else. I would go to work and social events with shitty old clothes while having someone's monthly salary worth in weed in my underwear. Couple bills to get myself a haircut would seem too much, only to spend four times the amount on a zip of weed without hesitation.

I don't know, for real. I'm at this point in life where weed barely has any effect on me, I would be stoned or high for 30 minutes up to an hour, my tolerance is fucking insane, there are nights when I go through entire zip in a less than a hour, all by myself, even couple nights ago I literally smoked five kingsized joints of a very good weed in less than a hour.

I do realize I'm addicted, I don't spend any money or anything else, I cancel plans because of it, I postpone plans because of it, I'm nonstop late at work because of it, I haven't experienced anything worth in life because of it, even though I got lots of life experience I'm still years behind my peers because of it.

It’s really hard for me to open up about this with my close circle without getting judged or misunderstood.

I’m 30yo, first puff at 16 and gradually increased my consumption to smoking daily for the last 8 years.
For that last year it had a huge impact on me mentally, thinking I was starting to experience schizophrenia (which runs in my family) and isolated myself only to smoke more. I’d wake up with anxiety and mini panic attacks hating myself and telling me today is the day I start my cure, only to roll a joint when I start feeling better in the afternoon.

Then recently I managed to stop for 6 weeks and out of nowhere decided it’d be a great idea after a hard days work to reward myself with a joint. 
Relapsed immediately for 3 weeks and got back where I was initially.
I am now on day 8 of being sober again. It sure wasn’t easy, but it’s getting easier each day. This time it’s for good, weed was a big part of my 20’s and I don’t regret it but I don’t want to spend my 30’s feeling like shit.

Going training (martial arts) as been a big help to understand and care about myself better.
Reading everyone’s stories inspired me to get back on a sober path, thank you for reading and good luck in your own battle. We’ve got this, it might take a few more relapse but the goal is clear now !

2021-10-07 05:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q35ecv/first_day_sober_and_my_backstory/,First Day Sober and My Backstory,"♡ Hello all ♡

I'm so happy I found this group. I don't have much support IRL, but I used to be active in eating disorder support groups on Reddit, which helped me tremendously. I'm happy to see that there are many other people just starting out on this journey, so I hope we can all help each other together.

I have been trying to stop smoking for a few months now with no success. I am definitely addicted. I'm pretty impulsive and totally have an addictive personality. I used to smoke weed casually, with friends, and rarely by myself. However, starting around December or January of this year, I started smoking by myself more often, which quickly spiraled into smoking every day and being high most of the day. I used weed when I began seriously recovering from my anorexia and bulimia. It did serve its purpose; weed helped increase my appetite while suppressing painful bloating and nausea. At the time, being high helped slow down my thinking enough to start unpacking a lot of my food anxiety and body image. I started questioning my relationship with my eating disorder which helped me realize I could let it go. I didn't need it anymore. I am 10 months in recovery from anorexia and bulimia, after suffering on and off for a decade ( ages 12-22 ). I am incredibly proud of myself for coming out the other end.

But I just became more dependent on weed. Sometimes, I try to talk to people about how I want to stop because I can't get anything done when I'm high. All I hear back is that I'm ""trying the wrong strain,"" or I just ""need to learn to be productive while high"" because that's what they do, and it works for them. But that's really not what I was looking for.

I'm a student, and I cannot do my homework or even want to do my homework if I'm high. Since smoking for almost a year straight with little breaks (family vacations etc.) I feel like it is so much harder to focus and absorb the material. It just doesn't come as easy as it used to.

When I'm high, all I do when I'm high is watch tv or Youtube or TikTok. Days go by, and I haven't done anything besides maybe making food or ordering takeout. And don't even get me started on the mess my home becomes. I have always had a problem keeping my space clean, and when I smoke, even if I try to clean up, my memory is so shoddy it takes so long to do simple tasks.

I get serious cravings too. I decided to stop smoking (again) last night, but I was really craving it when I got back from class. I found a tiny piece of weed on my chair that must've dropped the night before, so I immediately put it in the tiniest pipe I have and took a hit. I straight up don't have self-control when it comes to weed. When I've tried to quit prior, I won't even last a day sometimes. The cycle is I would buy, try not to smoke it multiple times a day, completely fail, decide to smoke as much as possible to use it up so I won't have it anymore because I know I do not have the self-control if it's in the house. I try not to buy more, but quickly (within 1-3 days) succumb to the cravings and withdrawal symptoms and rinse and repeat.

That's why I'm glad to be here. I'm looking for support and accountability, even if it's just being accountable for myself by writing honest posts. I'm looking to find myself again as well. I want to do more, be more, than I was when I smoked all day. I know I can do it; I fully quit 4-year nicotine addiction, and pulling myself out of a severe ED takes some serious willpower. I am stronger than I think.

I'm so happy to hear other people's stories, support others in feelings of defeat, and celebrate victories. Please don't be a stranger.

All my friends and family are stoners. They’re all supportive of me bettering myself, but don’t truly understand. I feel lonely and a little sad that I don’t have anyone to celebrate this with. My ex would be proud. We’re still friends. And weed was one of the biggest factors in our breakup. But I don’t want to hit her up, she’s with someone else now and it’s still painful. I could be proud of myself, and that should matter, right? My old therapist was always telling me to give myself credit. 

For those curious about the journey, here’s what I’m noticing. I feel good about my choices. I’m glad I quit, and I don’t want to start again and end up back where I was. I’ve been writing music more and working out more. I feel more emotionally balanced and generally calmer and happier than I did as a stoner. I have dreams every night, they were really intense for the first 3-4 weeks and then settled down. I enjoy having them again. I’m doing pretty well overall. I’m happier with the life I’m building. Kind of feeling down tonight, but it’s not nearly as bad as how I used to feel as a stoner or in the first few weeks of sobriety. I’m grateful for that.

After I quit in November 2019 my brother passed away and I thought I was fine but when I eventually relapsed in 2020 I was just trying to numb the pain. I haven’t gotten high most of my life, just starting in my mid/late twenties  (now 34)but I had become an every night smoker. I couldn’t wait to get home from work and get high to watch a show/movie or listen to music. It also led to me more often than not ordering food. Eventually I switched to a vape pen and would go through those like candy. Any time I could smoke outside of work or if I had to drive I would. It became so I didn’t want to do anything else so I could just get high. By the end I would get so paranoid of having some kind of attack that I would always ask myself when high “Why are you doing this again?” “Why do you want to feel like this?” I was just chasing something I could never reach and I was fogging my mind. That was one of the worst parts, the foggy mind and waking up feeling like shit.

So last October I decided one day after getting high with a friend that I would stop. I couldn’t keep making myself feel like that. It made my anxiety skyrocket and my depression worse. So I stopped. I had the usual symptoms of stopping, the anger, the headaches, weird dreams, you name it. But that lasted a couple of weeks. I can’t say I haven’t wanted to get high. I still want to but less now. I miss certain parts of it like smoking with friends, just zoning out, or having a high conversation about a topic I’m interested in. However I don’t miss all the other negative stuff that came with it. Will I stay away from weed forever? I don’t know, but I know I still want to stay away for now.

I started smoking weed a few years ago at college with friends and quickly fell in love with how it made me feel. The first few times I got high or cross-faded were very fun and I have been chasing that high ever since. 

 I don't know if this makes sense to others but to me, being high makes everything look and sound ""aesthetic"". I started to romanticize weed, thinking that I could only enjoy anything in life if I was high because I felt like weed makes you experience things more deeply, which isn't true. 

Because of that, I've put off enjoying so many things because I didn't have access to weed during the pandemic. I'll discover new music but will refuse to listen to it until I'm high, I won't let myself watch certain shows, etc. But whenever I finally do smoke up, I can never seem to enjoy things the way I had planned to. So I end up ""wasting"" my high and then when I run out of pot, I pine over it for months only to repeat the cycle when I get my hands on it again.

I wish I knew how to give myself permission to just enjoy things without weed, that being high is not the only way to perceive the beauty in my life and around me.",41,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45212087}"

I am 20 now and have been smoking for 4 years. Tried it with 16 and instantly fell in love with it... not long after that i was smoking on a daily basis. I live in a totally Illegal Europe State but that didn´t stop me from smoking since I really loved it and I still do to this day, have grown it myself and lately been to Amsterdam too... I even stopped drinking alcohol completely.

Now the negative parts and why I want to stop:

The main reason why I want to do it is because it is THE main thing in my life and I don´t really care about much other stuff..it feels like nothing aside it can make me happy. I don´t really care about girls, friends, finishing my driving license... I am still in training to be an electronics engineer and that´s one of the only things I really still do enjoy a bit but in work it's the only time when i am not stoned too. But when I come home I instantly smoke my bong.  And that's where the productive time stops and i am just smoking till I am asleep. One of the reasons why I started to smoke weed is because the sleep felt so amazing, but for me that wasn´t the case either anymore since i was growing weed in my room in my parents house and the fan was really noisy. 

I don´t have many friends left over either as I said, a few buddys I smoke with here and then, but they don´t understand me and still thinking weed is a great thing, and i cant be mad on them cause of that, but I got nobody to talk with about this topic.

I stopped a few times and sometimes it seemed to work, but then on hard days I just got back to it.

But now I got a job possibility to work as a software engineer in the future, and that is great because i always loved coding and really wanna go deeper. I love electronics but my heart just beats for coding.  I do even some coding stuff here and then in my free time, but weed really stops me that much. That is why I think it has to go. I really don't want to waste my life and be 30 and the only thing I did was work and smoke. 

So i packed my growing tent and put it in our cellar, and starring at my last bowl. When I post this I will smoke it, pack my bongs and the other stuff in the cellar too and will leave that life stage behind me, get a girlfriend maybe too if it works. I know it's hard to stop, but I believe I can do it, I was never so comitted to leaving than before... 

  
Also read about the X Method, will give it a try.

Or what I believe was about that. Time doesn't seem to work the same when you smoke daily. I've found it to move much faster over long periods of time, even though in the moment its slower. I quit for two and a half months back in May, but eventually relapsed and immediately fell back into daily use. I have now traded out the environment of my parents basement, both of my parents use daily and supplied my habit if I asked, for an apartment with friends who also use daily. As unfortunate that is for myself.

I am 21 and currently not going to college. I want to make a career out of music and that is already a challenge most don't succeed in in it's self. I loose so much time when I smoke and a massive amount of objectivity. I can not formulate my thoughts into anything productive, let alone my actions.

I'd love any advice on how to deal with them. I really can't go back to smoking. I don't want to look back in two, five, or ten years and ask what happened to all the time I wasted on the couch or in YouTube. I want to be free from this addiction.

**HOWEVER.**  


These 8 days have been the worst of my life, with severe emotional breakdowns on multiple of them and with unrelated social drama not helping. Given this, frankly, honestly, I think it might be prudent to turn this 'T-break' into a permanent one. I never want to go through this ever again. I figured 'hey, after a month I'd be able to restrict its usage from every day, right?' but I honestly don't know if I could. And I know for a fact that while simply 'being high' makes life seem fantastic, it doesn't truly do anything to make life actually fantastic.   
I honestly don't know how hard this will be, and I'm terrified that it was the thing keeping my anxiety and depression at bay. But it's clearly a bandage, not a cure. So, I think I should get myself a new birthday present: sobriety.

I've posted here before but just wanted to track my progress and share my story with you all.

I'm now about 50 days THC free and I feel great!  I'll admit the first few weeks were difficult, but once I got rid of all of my gear (bongs, pipes, papers, etc) I've found I have less of a reminder to smoke and it's on my mind way less.

I smoked steadily for 10 years, and in my darkest hour, I COULD NOT IMAGINE not smoking weed.  It was an ingrained part of my day, and I made every excuse to not quit smoking.

A friend warned once that when I stop smoking, my lungs would get overwhelmed with mucous because they're used to having smoke in them.  Guess what?? Didn't happen! My lungs are much happier without smoke in them.

One thing I will say is that the cravings have not gone away.  I think for me at least, it's something that will take a long time to go away, and I've just got to learn to let the craving pass, and I'm fine.  So just know that your cravings will probably persist, but they get much easier to deal with as time passes.

I notice it most strongly when I have a day off and am playing video games or watching TV.  When my day's not structured, I want to fall back on that crutch of filling time by getting high.
 
I remember reading that boredom is a big cause for addiction, and for me at least it's true!  I find if I just  go on a walk, play guitar, or read a book, the impulse to smoke tapers off.

When my teeth started bleeding I realised it had happened many times before, only I had just brushed it under the rug and told myself that it would be fine. I even deluded myself into thinking that pot would probably make it better. I have been smoking cigarettes, bongs, chewing on lollies, taking large amounts of drugs that dry your mouth out and knock your teeth around, all since before I had hair on my nuts.

My head hurts all. Day. Every. Day. So getting in from work and smoking is the only way I’ve found to cope so far. The weed gives me a mental release but it also gives me reflux, gross throat issues, and I have almost no savings and a tonne of debt as a result.

A quick overview of my journey with marijuana: It all started out when I was 15-16 years old, at that time me and my friends felt like rebels, thinking that weed is harmless fun enhancing every trip, game, conversation, relationship. But 4 years later after consistent use 4-7times/week I can feel that I've lost a lot of my activeness and mental sharpness. Got tired of waking up and not having the motivation to even get out of bed, let alone do anything useful.

Being 20 now, I can't afford to waste my time anymore. Recently relapsed after 3 weeks of non-use and all of my feelings regarding stopping use only got a lot stronger as I realized the harm I'm doing to my body. I'm writing here so I hold myself more **accountable** and further **admit** to **myself** that I've got a problem that I **desperately need to take care of**.

Finally, I have some tips that helped me start the inevitable conversation with myself:  
1. **Write it down on paper** and go into detail **WHY** you want change. ""*Paper is to write things down that we need to remember. Our brains are used to think.*"" - Albert Einstein

2.I really recommend getting active physically, **""Five Tibetans: Five Rites of Enlightenment"" yoga** did the job for me, every morning regardless whether I want to or don't, I always take up this routine, just to **feel** in **control** of my **life**. It's not hard and you'll **learn a lot**, TRUST ME!

3.**Meditation**; it really helps to **fully understand** your **body and mind**. It doesn't have to be anything drastic, only 10-30min/day, but I recommend making a habit of doing at least 10min before going to bed. After **relaxing your mind**: **review your day**, **congratulate yourself** and **plan tomorrow's morning**. The same when you wake up, take 5-10min to **relax your mind**, **fix/make your breathing** **rhythmic**, and **remind yourself what your plans for the day** are, **wish yourself good luck** and carry on.

Writing things down, thinking and understanding myself has made me a lot more confident about my abilities to do anything. I really hope that whoever is reading this has a great day and I wish you good luck on your journey!

Changes -

Sleep - It's trash although I am falling asleep by like 12 every night.

Cravings - I am craving way healthier food. I'm not just autopiloting bull crap that's in my general area or grubhubbing trash.

Mood - Way more energy and happier presently, I have dealt with depression for eons and I've realized maybe kush wasn't doing me any justice dealing with it after all. I've been dealing with massive relationship issues for quite some time and this is helping me process some of the issues better and let me understand the expectations I have set for myself.

Energy - Waking up is a terror but I am way more energized throughout my day without the ""green over"". I have been having crashes throughout the day but that's probably stress-related and me just exhausted with my current living situation.

Mindfulness and Awareness - I am becoming much more in tune with my logical side and emotional side, I don't find myself as emotionally overwhelmed and wanting to smoke out of panic or just boredom

I'm excited to say this has been one of the biggest hurdles I've managed to tackle, quitting has been so tough for me to do.

Up until 3 days ago I realized how much it has been holding me back in life and I made the decision that I need to quit. I am so ashamed to admit this because nobody around me has this type of addiction or let alone any addiction. That is why I am glad to have found you guys. I looked through my bank statements and I have gone through a total of 10 bottles of gummies within a span of 6 months. This is obviously an addiction and I was so close to taking a gummy this morning because the cravings were so bad, but thankfully I did not give in to the temptation and instead decided to do a workout. I would have never thought that I would have such a huge addiction for this and I am embarrassed to tell my family and friends about it.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41722244}"

Longtime lurker looking for help... And maybe just hoping to vent. I had success for a good 7-8 months period near the start of the pandemic. I was working out instead of smoking and generally eating better etc. I believe the primary reason was the commitment to staying away from weed.

After a while I felt pretty confident and I changed my rules to I just won't smoke alone or with a few select buddies because I smoked with them all the time. Also, I couldn't suggest it. Obviously, this quickly derailed me. I believe this is in part due to an injury that kept me out of the gym. So I filled the time with weed, video games etc slowly justifying changing my rules until they were non existent.

I sit here writing this wondering what went wrong. I mean, it's so obvious logically, but how do we avoid this trap of overconfidence? Since I was mostly isolated during this first time and I have more contact with friends this time, how do we actually turn down weed without feeling guilt, shame, desire etc.?",5,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43168733}"

I quit cold turkey yesterday. Before then I was smoking 2 joints a day, and constantly hitting my wax pen throughout the day, going through them at an alarming rate. 

I decided it was time to stop. I’m currently on the deans list in college and take every single test and exam under the influence. Smoking before every test and after. It has not affected my academic performance but I’m quitting for other reasons. Financial being one of the biggest ones. 

I have a medical condition that causes me to sweat much more than your average person. When I first smoked weed, the sweating was almost cured instantly. However as time went on my sweating would be moderately controlled when high and not too controlled once it wore off. As a result I started smoking pretty much every hour throughout the day. 

Since quitting the sweating is very bad, I’m sitting in an online lecture currently and sweating like crazy. What I did find quite strange is that I didn’t have too much difficulty falling asleep. I know it’s only day 1 but other than the sweating a slight mood swings I’m coping. It does help that I’ve quit cold turkey before for for 6 months.

2021-10-05 13:11:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q20x5c/playing_the_tape_forward/,Playing the tape forward,"This evening my wife told me she's going out and that I'm child free. Something in my brain went ""Yes, that means you can get high tonight"" even though I've committed to this journey. I then remembered the technique of 'playing the tape forward' which has 2 outcomes.   

1st outcome - I pick up some weed, smoke it and hate it. This is what has happened the last 10 thousand times, yet something in me still craves it. I'll be anxious, overly self conscious, paranoid, restless and will spend the next 3 or 4 hours trying to ground myself through various breathing exercises. It will inevitably end in me throwing out the weed and getting to bed feeling guilty. Tomorrow morning will start off with that groggy morning after feeling, with a deep sense of regret thrown in for good measure.  

2nd outcome - I enjoy it. I eat the contents of the kitchen, I masturbate into oblivion and binge watch the Simpsons like the good old days. In 3 or 4 hours I'll pass out, feeling full, washed out and extremely guilty. I'll then be worrying about how I've ran out already and will need to buy more tomorrow. This will probably carry on for a month or 2 until I'm having problems at work, sleep issues, problems with my wife or all of the above. Then I will have to start all over again with insomnia and catastrophic emotional rollercoastering until I return to normal.  

It seems obvious now I type it all out. The ONLY option for me is option 3 - don't buy any weed. Do my chores, maybe watch some Simpsons anyway and just 'be'. I don't need to do anything in particular to make myself happy. I just need to be in my own skin for a few hours.  Tomorrow I'll wake up refreshed and ready for whatever life throws at me, no matter how painful it is.

I am a med card holder quitting cannabis. I began using 5+ times a day due to a stressful job as a programmer back in 2014.

My method of choice was dry herb vaping.

I decided to quit because I'm concerned for my health and also don't want to limit opportunities while I look for a new job.

It has been rough. I have felt sick the entire time. Nausea, chest pain,, sore throat, headaches, and hoarse coughing. 

The mornings have been the most intense. This morning I woke up in the am with all symptoms and then coughed so hard I was seeing stars for the next 15 seconds. That triggered an anxiety attack so I took a bath to try to alleviate that.

I went to urgent care and they said my lungs were fine based on a chest xray. They seemed confused when I said quitting cannabis was causing those symptoms though.

Has anyone had any experience with this? I have a hiking trip next week and want to make sure I'm playing things safe. I have a rescue inhaler but don't want to risk passing out in the middle of nowhere.

I am so proud of what I've done and finally did it, better than I ever have, after years of struggling and slipping. Fuck everything cannabis has done to my life. Started smoking at 14 and I'm 23 now

All this is true, and yet, I'm feeling a strong craving to smoke (weed, although I see it as not all that much better than my other doc, for me personally. Only craving pot atm). That temporary euphoria sounds pretty nice right now, and it would be nice to not think about some of my current problems, just for a bit. I could workout on it, listen to some music, go for a stoned swim, and would be able to not let it impact my work or my social life, so long as I did it today, did it somewhat soon, and didn't keep doing more.

So why am I writing this post? I never post on here but wish I did more. It at least gives me something to do to give my craving some time to go away. It gives me the chance to find some support from this wonderful community, and I welcome any messages or comments that want to talk this through. Not only to support me, but for me to support anyone who might have less clean time than me. Helping someone like that would help me, and even though I'm not the perfect role model at the moment, I'd like to think I have some wisdom, insight, and compassion to share. I should add that I've been feeling pretty lonely lately. I mean, who honestly hasn't.

I still don't know if I'm talking myself into it or talking myself out of it, but if I still have a clear head I might as well use it to talk to myself. If anyone is in my position... DON'T DO IT! I hope I don't. I want to but I don't really. I want to dream tonight. I don't want to watch myself become dull. I don't want carb cravings that persist even if I eat until my stomach is so full it hurts. Most of all, I really fucking don't want to get back to smoking every day, and this is the first step to get right back into that habit.

*Sidenote: If anyone ever wants someone to rant to/needs advice, my DMs are always open. If you find my journey spoke to you at all, I would love to help you on yours. :)*




Well I made it to a whole year, a whopping 365 days. You may recognize my username from the Leaves discord chats, although I have been much less active the past 6 or so months than I was the first 6 months. I cannot believe that I was able to stay off weed for an entire year, it literally boggles my mind. In this post I want to give some thoughts and advice to anyone who is thinking of starting their journey, or is just beginning theirs. I firmly, firmly believe that if I am able to, then anyone is able to.

A little background on me: 27yo male, started smoking when I was 16, daily by the time I was 17. Depressed, anxious, ADHD, used weed to ""level myself out"" and ""calm down"" at the end of the day. My consumption grew to insane levels by my freshman year of college, and had to leave college after one year to try and figure things out. I returned, kept smoking, and eventually flunked out. I worked for a while, saved up some money, and then left to go to Mexico to follow a passion: scuba diving. I loved it and spent 5+ years doing it, but I was smoking daily, I was just in a place that it didn't matter too much. I didn't realize it then, but I was doing what I loved but my mental health was still a total mess. After corona shut that down I came back home, and over the first 6 months of lockdown I kept finding ways to pickup/ get carts or bud. And then I had my break through with finally being strong enough to quit.

I picked up an oz of bud from my cousin, and this shit reeked to high heavens. I was going on a date that night, she smoked but I was still embarrassed by how much this weed stunk. Then I went on a weekend away with friends who didn't smoke, and the entire car just reeked of pot. I just felt shame about this and it made me anxious anytime I smoked. My heart rate was spiking to like 120, I could feel my blood pressure rise, and I just generally felt shit anytime I smoked, but I also couldn't stop. I knew of /r/leaves from many years in the past, and started lurking again. I checked out the discord chats, and started to really believe that this was the way forward for me. At one point I just broke down crying in the shower cause I had smoked at like 9am, lied to my parents, and it all hit me how shitty this plant made me feel. I lurked until I finished what I had (I wasn't strong enough to throw away my stash) and then fully committed. 

[Here is my first step, as recorded by the Discord chat!](https://imgur.com/a/uQFsOBs)

I feel like my body was just giving me signs that it was totally done with weed. I just wanted to give a few things that I've learned from being a part of this community for a year now, and hopefully some of you will find this useful.

* **USE THE DISCORD CHATS RELIGIOUSLY IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS**

These chats absolutely made a huge difference for me, and made me realize there is such a huge community behind you and attempting the same hard as hell life choice that you are. Seriously. Use them. Love the subreddit but nothing can replace the on the fly support of the chats.

* ONE DAY AT A TIME. That's the only fight, don't look any further than that. All you need to focus on is not smoking today, and today only. Don't worry about streaks, just one foot in front of the other.

* For anyone that is younger and lurking/undecided of whether to quit, look at a lot of the posts here. There are lots and lots of people who's biggest regret with this process was not starting earlier. It can definitely be more complicated when younger, but as they say ""the best day to quit was yesterday, the next best is today"". Take control of your life back.


* It is hard as hell. I was lucky that my family was supportive and due to the lockdown, I wasn't around any friends that smoked. So I had an ideal situation to deal with the first few weeks, but sleep was restless, I had manic-like moments, and just generally wasn't myself. But the best thing from that is you realize how much of an effect this little plant can have on your body and mind. And also how much it sucks so you don't want to go through it again... For people who are quitting when significant others/roommates still smoke, it's going to be that much harder, but YOU ARE WORTH IT. YOU ARE BETTER THAN THIS DRUG.


* PAWS/anhedonia. This is my slightly controversial take in this community, but I think these are slightly perceived wrongly in the quitting group. I definitely agree that PAWS exists, but I strongly believe that people are much more likely just depressed/anxious in a general sense rather than just as a result from quitting, especially many months after quitting. It takes work to improve your mental state, and I fear that some people will just sit and try and ""wait out"" PAWS/anhedonia. I know it's my own experience, but I was depressed before weed, and I was just using it as self-medication, and then when I quit all those problems I was covering up came back. I highly encourage everyone on this journey to seek out a mental health professional if you are able, because it's a big step and they can help you navigate the thought traps.

* Going off that: it's not all sunshine and rainbows on the other side! I still deal with anxiety, depression, but now I face them rather than hiding behind weed. I want to lose weight, I haven't stopped drinking completely (although in much more control now), I procrastinate like crazy. But this is one thing I have taken control of and I'm so proud of that.


* There was a hump for me, prob about 3-5 months in, where I just stopped seeing myself as ""someone quitting weed"" but rather ""someone who just doesn't smoke"". It helped immensely viewing myself in that light when I would occasionally be around weed later on. There were about 5 or 6 times I was around a joint being passed and it was surprisingly easy to say ""nah, I'm good"" at that point. 

*  When first starting out, don't think of it as the last time you're smoking weed, think of it as the first time you are CHOOSING not to smoke. That small shift in perception can help you move forward with your life, weed free.

Many posts make a point that weed is an easy and lazy way to trick your brain to give you that feel good feeling, as If you rewarded yourself. A lot of people have told me to fill your time with other people, or tasks to help you feel rewarded as you lack that instantaneous pleasure from getting high.

Here's the problem. Ever since I can remember growing up, I never really felt good about my achievements. It was more of , at least in my household be happy that you didn't fuck up. I remember when I was going through highschool and my friends are all proud of their grades, or something they made in woodshop,b and I'm just like... Whatever.....

Like if I get a new job, I'm maybe happy for an hour and anxious for the rest of the time until I'm well settled in that job.

However I am worried that in 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, etc… I will forget how much weed sucks, and how much it’s fucked everything.

But I am implementing of ways to remember what it’s like to be in a weed haze, such as this post, this community, and journaling, so I hope to find success in my journey.

2021-10-04 22:52:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q1ltnv/day_30/,Day 30,"My problem with weed is that it didn’t have a strong effect on me while I was high. I was able to smoke and stay motivated to workout, work, clean etc and perform these tasks at close to 90% effectiveness. That I’m itself is a problem because if I can do everything high with minimal impact, why not be high all the time.

What started as smoking a little at night turned into 15-20 bong rips a day before during and after work. Weekends included smoking and working out, smoking and cleaning, and smoking and playing video games. 

People that knew me before saw little change in my behavior when high but after 10 years of being high it’s finally taken it’s toll. I finally hit a standstill with my performance at work (tech sales) and among other things going on I started to have mental breakdowns. Severe bouts of emotional episodes and depression. I started to hate myself because all I wanted to do was smoke and I found little to no pleasure from life without weed. I tried to blame everything else, my job, my financial situation, my health, the pandemic etc, but finally I was able to confront the true reason when my brother quit and explained how much happier he was. He showed me it was possible. 

I knew it was time. I made a decision to quit for at least 90 days to figure out my job situation, but now I can’t see myself going back. I interviewed and got offers from multiple companies to figure out that I am happy where I am just without weed.

 My days are 100% better. I look forward to my future and not just my next bong rip. 

Dreams and night sweats have by far the worst part for me (I’ve always had these problems and weed solved that problem for me which paved the way for my dependency) but my dreams are so vivid I wake up at least 3X a night in a pool of sweat and panic from whatever nightmare I’m having. It’s a small price to pay for such a positive gain during the day. 

I was able to taper down for around a month and I think this really helped with my loss of appetite and headaches which I rarely experienced. 

My performance at work increased exponentially, mostly because I’m so much happier during the day. I enjoy talking to my coworkers instead of avoiding them so I can read more articles on my phone. My partner and I have great conversations and laugh more than we have in years. As much as i imagine myself smoking in moderation, I just don’t see a way that’s possible for me. 

I’ve left weed, hopefully never to return and I’ve really enjoyed it so far. For years I thought going a month would be impossible so I never even tried. Having a supportive partner has been extremely empowering in my journey. She never judges, on encourages and sometimes holds me accountable. 

I hope you all can find your way like I did and I hope we can share the truths about cannabis. It can be a great treatment but also a massive crutch. One that you grow increasingly dependent on until it is too late.

2021-10-04 18:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q1hlfh/what_justified_smoking/,What justified smoking?,"- Boredom
- Excitement (such as a party)

- Loneliness
- Socializing

- Unhappiness
- Happiness

- I just woke up
- I want to go to sleep

- Life being normal
- Life being a lot (good or bad)

- To be less stressed to go do something (work or chores)
- To be more relaxed to go do nothing (sit slack-jawed on the couch for hours)

- To help make friends (it didn't, took time to realize)
- To help improve isolation (it didn't, took time to realize)

- Just being alive and awake
- Not being high enough/the high wore off
- To have something to do
- To make time pass

And by the time I reached those last reasons as my daily justification for constant smoking, I practically became a spectator to my life, almost watching from afar as I did nothing but smoke day in and day out, the moment I woke up until I'd pass out, feeling unsatisfied but trapped in the habit-hole I created...    

    


Slowly but surely, every time I tried to smoke ""just once"" or once in a while, for just one small reason - It would quickly creep and grow to encompass every other possible reason, until there is no reason - I just needed to be high, all the time. And then I'd smoke to the point of having no ability to reason. To being completely broke and homeless. Begging for money to go spend on weed and begging for my car I lived in to not be towed away when it broke down somewhere I couldn't park overnight. Somehow I kept lying to myself that it wasn't rock bottom, I didn't need help, it would be okay... But obviously, it wasn't the truth. My addiction kept feeding me lies in order to feed itself. Besides those hard times, being a 24/7 stoner also made me uninteresting, unmotivated, unchanging, unable to learn, and unable to grow.

I think those justifications are a big part of what defines me as a painful, true, debilitating, 100% real, disease-afflicted addict and helped keep me addicted for such a long time. I think ""normal smokers"", or people who can handle smoking once in a while, or people who don't plan their entire life around it or make it their whole identity, don't have all these justifications. Which is hard for me to understand, but a good reminder of how I can't ""be normal"" and moderate. There's no point wishing I could be like them, because I'm me, and I know from lots of experience trying that I just can't handle it. I lose control. I become a slave to my addiction, giving it everything I can, until there's nothing left for it to take.

    
    

Weed is not the solution for what life hands me - actually, it made my life much worse over time.
Weed is not the solution to being alive - in fact, it's nearly killed me several times.

    
    

My quit date is 6/1/21, I just passed 120 days or 4 months. This is my longest sober stretch of the past 4 years I believe. I want to keep stretching. Only good things have come from being sober. I'm healing, growing, and improving, and there's no way I could do that high.

Every day I find new, better solutions for those old smoking justifications that surprisingly make me much more satisfied with my life now. New hobbies I try, new people I meet (mostly from AA, MA, & SMART meetings), and new events and places I go to make sober life so bright. I'm in the process of getting a job, and my history has shown I can't keep one when I'm high. I'm getting back on my feet and moving up, things are looking up... But it's still terrifying to look back down at how far gone I was and think about what could go horribly wrong. How if I slipped up and started lying to myself that I could try it again, how far I would inevitably fall and end up, in just a matter of some lies and a 20 minute trip to a special store. My life would essentially be over again, like it was. I don't want to go back there. I choose life and never smoking again.

    
    

Even if maybe your consequences weren't as harsh, did your justifications when you smoked look similar? Do you feel comfortable describing yourself as a marijuana addict in recovery? Have you heard how the disease model applies to chemical addictions? Do you still get cravings, and how do you handle them? I appreciate hearing from everyone, so don't be shy to comment :)

The thing is my girlfriend who I live with smokes everyday still so it's literally in front of me everyday yet I've managed to not do it. Until one day. All it takes is that one day as weed is always in my house.

I believe I can quit again that's OK but it's inevitable I will smoke again as the girlfriend smokes it. What the hell do I do? Give an ultimatum or something?

I would still be clean I'm sure if it wasn't for that. Yes I understand its my choice but it's like putting an alcoholic with someone who drinks everyday. It's not smart.

It has definitely made brought me out of my shell more and feel more me on the days after I smoke as I don't smoke during the day unless weekend. And feel more connected with people. Its weird as I never had these effects before.

I meditate everyday BTW which helps alot also.

Have rebounded several time, have a gf, job, good habits. need help/advice","Throw away account for reasons below. This is just a rant that I want to look back on. Wall of text inc. Feel free to read or give me advice! Thanks

Been lurking on this sub for a while. Started smoking weed when I was in college freshman year. Throughout college I smoked a little but only ever at parties or on weekends.

7 years have gone by since then and I now have a full time job that pays well with benefits, I have a gf for the last 5 yeara and will get married and have kids in the next few years.
The problem with work is that I may randomly get drug tested. Now I haven’t heard of it happening to anyone but the risk is still there. This is a reason I need to quit because I don’t live in a state where it is legal.

I feel like when I smoke its really hard for me to be present. I feel like I need to smoke to be happy cooking, cleaning, its good after a long day at work or even just to relax on the weekends. My gf dad smokes and she does not like when he does it so I can’t imagine she enjoys when I smoke but she doesn’t make it a big deal and sometimes sits with me outside while I smoke. She doesnt smoke not a puff. I still don’t think she likes it but doesn’t tell me directly. But sometimes idk i feel like i can see it in her eyes? This is another reason I want to quit. We also plan on having kids in the future and I don’t want them to have a dad that’s high all the time.

This is the 2nd or 3rd time this year that I have tried to stop and end up going back. I am pretty healthy I meal prep, go to the gym etc. i have a friend that I invite over that brings me bud but I don’t have a dealer myself which is good I guess. I love my friend and he’s supportive so if He wants to come over and hangout he usually brings me some. But he’s told me when I’ve tried to quit that he can not smoke when he comes over if it will help me.

I know I have a problem that may be addiction related? Im not sure. I still have bud at home so even the thought if getting off work and going home to smoke after is possible.

Some things I think need to happen: throw away my grinder, hang out with my friend sober, talk to my gf about if, consider going to therapy. I just want to be present with my gf and My future. Im not in a “tough” situation compared to others I think but it feels hard.

I started smoking weed at age 27 (starting with 1 j a night after gym) then developed into a full blown addict smoking 8-10 a day. I was basically always stoned non stop, i would wake up at night after a 4 hr sleep then hit a smoke and get high and sleep again. I loved it tbh, i loved the feeling of it and every aspect of it. 

June 21st 2021, i took cipro for a suspected uti and got side effects after 3 pills and stopped immediately. (i didn't know about them and was assured by the idiot ignorant doctor that its very rare. So even with the pains and distress of the side effects i tried to blaze up as usual which threw me into a horrendous panic attack that never happened in my life .

So i chose to stop, however as we all know the sudden cold turkey and especially from someone who went from 10 a day to 0 caused me a lot of phycological issues as i smoked to cope with depression (losing my business, surviving the beirut blast on august 4th that kept me traumatized for a while).

I want some advice and help from anyone as to how to cope without weed as i loved it and miss it to be honest but i have put my body health as priority (cut out sugars, eating healthy, etc..)

I get depressed everytime i see my friends blazing up and its hard for me truly. I am seeing a therapist who helps me juggle all these issues : general depression from the side effects, pain, and including the weed withdrawal. Its been 3 months now , im happy that i was able to cease it but at the same time my brain keeps making me miss it. Its like someone is inside my head telling me you can't enjoy life without it. I admit as my therapist tells me that i developed an addiction to it.

The last three years have been a slow progression from living in absolute hell (multiple addictions, major depression, anxiety/panic disorder, suicide attempt, and 3+ months in psychiatric care) to being happier than I can ever remember. I am caring for myself again, spending time with my Mom & Dad who I neglected for decades, getting to know my son who I also neglected for the first 14 years of his life, and somehow I convinced myself to go back to school to pursue psychology in my 40s—I am most proud of this decision.

Until today, I really didn't think I needed to make any further changes. I started smoking weed when I stopped drinking and smoking tobacco. It helped to fill the time, took my mind off other cravings, and it significantly reduced my anxiety (at least to start). As I got stronger, both mentally and physically, I actually thought the weed was playing a part in my extra energy. What I didn't notice was the very slow increase to the amount I was smoking each day. When I first started, I only smoked one joint over the course of an evening. As of last night, I smoked at least 5 each evening. 

As successful as life had seemed lately, I was still having a huge issue finding the energy to wake up at 6:00 each morning, which I really need to do if I am going to have a successful day, especially with school. This week I only woke up before 10:00 once. Once I lose 4 hours of productivity, I get discouraged, procrastinate, and then it turns into another wasted day.

This morning I really gave this issue some thought. At first I thought; maybe I am just getting too old to do all of this studying and I am fooling myself into thinking I can work towards a PhD in my 40s. Then I started thinking about the amount my weed consumption has increased, especially over the last year. So I googled something about weed consumption and loss of energy and it brought me to this sub-reddit. 

Friends, I seriously spent the entire day reading your posts to see if anything correlated with my experiences. As you already know, everything I am experiencing has been experienced by many of you. 

I really hope this brings me less anxiety, less procrastination, more energy, and more time! I am also really looking forward to dreaming again. If nothing else, at least I can put the money towards something useful!

Thanks for listening,

On September 1st was sentenced to 18 months probation and I really thought that was the end of me I knew leaving that court room I’d be right back in here to be sentenced to jail. I went home and I just sat there in like a shock / panic like what am I gonna do this is all I have left I went to go take a shower my first shower in years without taking at least a hit of my bong or smoking a blunt and I just stared at myself in the mirror for a good 20 minutes (as corny as this sounds I’ve never been a big believer in god or anything in that sort of way) but I got on the ground and begged god to help me like I’ve never prayed in my life but i remember saying to myself it probably won’t help but what if it did I remember crying begging god to help me get clean I knew I couldn’t go back to alcohol it would just be a spiral back into my deep addiction again I took a shower sobbing the entire time feeling so dumb when I left that bathroom that day I felt a weight lifted off my shoulder I went up to my room and threw away all my weed and paraphernalia something I could never bring myself to do I haven’t had the urge once to smoke that day or do anything else I don’t know if it’s my willpower or my prayer was actually heard but I don’t think I will ever question if god is real or not  again.

I used to be so dedicated to school and was top of my class through grades 1-12. I started smoking pot in high-school and while at first I was able to maintain grades, sports, friends and a girlfriend, eventually my addictive nature got the best of me.  I've been basically addicted to smoking pot for 12 years. I did decent in undergraduate studies but was deteriorating and losing my mind to pot.

 I managed to scrape my way into grad school and then basically goofed my way through that program. Now I'm supposed to be a professional, but I barely studied and barely know my craft. I did the bare minimum to get through and with the way 2020 was, the requirements were more lax than normal. So I'm an extremely unqualified person soon to enter a profession I think I'm destined to flunk out of once they realize I suck. I spent so much time getting high and doing the dumbest things like watching entire seasons of shows. During grad school I I kicked the porn addiction side of it and I got a steady girlfriend.  However my pot addiction is just as bad as ever. I just feel like I wasted so much time and destroyed myself so much that I can't take myself seriously anymore. 

I don't respect myself at all cause I've hated my pot addiction since I was 16 and lost the battle for 10 years. The most i ever did was 110  days. But i always come back. There was so much I wanted to do with my youth and my life, and I feel that now that I passed 25, the damage is permanent and I can't become who I want to be. Like  I'll always permanently be a stoner brain who at best has turned his life around but still at his core is a damaged man. 

How do I get out of this? How do I jump back in to life at 27 when people I know are so far ahead of  me and I'm still fighting the same battle 16 year old me was fighting? When I've wasted so much time, money and brain cells on pot? So many times I've been in despair, yet I always come back.",66,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.88000107}"

2021-10-03 22:11:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q0w5ky/an_image_that_has_helped_me_stay_sober/,An Image That Has Helped Me Stay Sober,"I think of my brain as a tree. The trunk and branches represent the foundation of my brain. And the leaves represent all that I've learned, the neural pathways that have been strengthened, my ability to remember, my executive functioning abilities, all that good brain stuff.

Many months ago when I smoked my last joint and started fresh (again), the tree was completely bare, just trunk and branches.

I felt stupid and slow. I couldn't hold a conversation with anyone because I would forget what I was talking about or what they were saying mid sentence. I couldn't even enjoy movies high anymore (used to be my favorite) because I'd forget what was going on as I was watching. I was just a mess.

But after a couple of weeks sober, leaves started budding again. After a month they were clearly visible. After a few months even more leaves grew in. And I'd like to think that at the point that I am now, my tree is full and bushy, lush with beautiful foliage.

I nearly relapsed twice over the past month or so. One of the things that helped me was to keep this image of that tree in my mind, knowing it represented my brain that had time to heal, grow, make connections again, and become stronger and become more.

And I thought about how smoking a joint (and smoking thereafter for weeks/months, because it always goes that long), would be equivalent to me taking a trimmer and sheering off all of that beautiful foliage. And that beautiful tree will have been reduced to just branches again. I will have lost all that progress.

This helps me in two ways.

First, when I imagine that lush tree in my mind, I know that I don't want to sheer off all the leaves. I like it like as it is, as it was meant to be. I worked hard and gave it time to grow back into what it is today. Second, I remember that if I stay sober, that the tree will only continue to grow further, more and more lush, and I wonder about how much more beautiful it could get if I just stay the course and leave the tree alone.

Sacrificing one green for the benefit of another green I guess you could say.

Keeping this image in mind has helped me remember what I *really* want. I hope it might help someone else too :)

🌳

EDIT: I thought about removing ""I will have lost all that progress."" Because though I think there's truth to this, in the bigger picture, I don't think it's true. You never lose your progress, no matter how many times you relapse. It may feel like you do. It may feel like you've completely let yourself down and lost everything. But each time you relapse, you don't lose, you actually gain. You gain an opportunity to learn more deeply and to understand yourself and your relationship with weed more deeply. And each time you grow a little wiser, even if you don't realize. It's just another step to getting to where you want to be in the long run. And who knows, maybe I'll relapse again in the future. I'll just keep going, as we all will together :)",23,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45401418}"

So I feel like smoking a little wouldn't be a big deal, since I've made so much recovery.  
Haha it still sounds good to me, but I gotta know at this point, my brain is lying to me. I'm tapping into logic rather than my emotions to stay safe on this issue. I have to remember the reason I feel better now is because I'm off the herb. It was hell going through those withdrawals, and feeling like I needed to smoke just to feel okay. So it's great that I feel so much better now, and that's not a reason to smoke weed again. It's a reason to stay off it. The fact that when I start to feel good again, I think that I could handle weed again should be a big warning sign to me. So I'll just keep doing what I've been doing, and feeling better and better.

1. I want to be more connected to my body and emotions, which is why I’m going to a somatic therapist. I’m basically wasting my money with my therapist if I’m gonna keep getting high every night - being high makes me dissociate. I use it to numb out negative feelings.
2. That uncomfortable restless feeling in my stomach? I COULD get rid of it with weed, OR I could do a mindfulness activity like painting, or something more “productive” that needs to be done, like cleaning the kitchen.
3. I genuinely need to get some homework done tonight, and I can’t do that high. I’m done being unmotivated and letting my days slip away with weed.
4. I want to experience life for what it is! Because it’s beautiful already, and when it doesn’t feel beautiful, I still want to feel that experience.

2021-10-03 19:46:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q0tqnd/day_one_again/,Day one... again.,"So I quit pot almost a month ago, I hit 11 days before I started having cravings again. I remember waking up and just deciding to order and doing so. I live in a legal state and am able to order delivery so i did. By time the stuff arrived (a joint and a vape cart) I'd decided I didnt want it. I did what I did when I want a beer, told myself I could have one tomorrow if I still wanted it. Input it on a shelf and decided to go for a walk to clear my head.

It had been a bad day up until that point. My life isn't going great, I'm long term unemployed and having severe struggles with functioning lately. I've been struggling to remember to eat or drink and have long suffered with issues with dehydration. I had been woken up early by my cat and couldn't get back to sleep, and took out my frustration on them by yelling at them. I love my cats more than anything in my life and was upset to hear my fathers words coming out of my mouth. When I left, I yelled at my cats that ""hopefully I never come back.""

I ended up passing out at the store and hitting my head. Paramedics were called andninwas taken to the hospital. I was scared and kept shaking, and they'd ask if I was cold. I'd say no, and that was the end of discussion. The hospital did a bunch of test but barely acknowled me, they told me ""they didnt know why I passed out."" I knew I was dehydrated but they didnt give me fluids and discharged me (I had to walk home.)

I got home and was upset and scared. I texted my sister and a friend and told them what happened. I had already decided I was happier not smoking and I was proud of myself for quitting... but for some reason I decided I wanted to smoke the joint. I told myself it was just because of the pain and it would help. I was conflicted about it and texted my friend looking for support. He told me to smoke it if I needed it (I didn't) and not to worry about it. So I smoked the joint. At first just a few puffs until I felt numb. Then I kept smoking, then used the vape. I smoked the cartridge until it was empty last night and felt horrible.

So today I threw away all the gear I had (I could probably afford to buy flower, I sure as hell can't afford to replace my pipe.) I don't want to smoke and I know that just like booze, I can't have just one. I know that for me, it's not a physical addiction it's the routine. When I lost my job, I lost all my routines I had to be able to function. Smoking is just something to fill the time (just like scrolling through reddit.)

I miss not being able to dream (I kind of dreamt last night, I remember parts of it) and miss not feeling rested. I don't want to use anymore and I know not to rely on people who aren't going to be supportive of me.

I stopped as I was experiencing the preliminary symptoms of CHS and after \~10\*\* years of daily use, a physical ailment was literally the only thing that could have made me quit, despite not really loving my habit and/or the money I was spending any more. I’ve always had horrible insomnia so I relied on weed to sleep, even though with it my sleep was often still interrupted depending on my state of mind and other factors like hunger/not eating enough consistently. 

The first few months were sensational and I experienced life in refreshing, new ways. In a pretty constant state of joy and happiness and it was honestly a nice change to be sober. My sense of smell strengthened, my relationship to food is much healthier, I was sleeping REALLY hard and well, etc. 

My sobriety has also aligned with fully accepting my own autism and exploring what that means for myself in terms of my emotional state, extreme sensory sensitivity/relationship to the world around me, etc. But now that more time had passed, I’m in a period of severe depression unfortunately. All of these feelings have made me wish I could go back to using weed the way I did before to cope, but I have tried smoking since and it’s just made me feel awful since I no longer have any tolerance for it and it’s not as though I want to be harming my lungs and constantly depleting my own dopamine (and bank account). 

I’m definitely missing my initial sober euphoria and feeling disappointed to be hit with a ton of bricks as far as feeling like life has no point. It’s made me realize just how much weed has numbed me up consistently feeling hard emotions for extended periods of time for so long. Don’t get me wrong, I could still feel anxious or sad when I was smoking, but not smoking gives you so many life hours in the day to actively question your life, existence, etc. and sit with your difficult feelings. Smoking also dulled the sensations of my autism that I feel in full now, and it can be a lot to handle - I get overstimulated easily whether it be from sounds, sights or smells (ironically including the smell of smoke which I HATE now and was numb to before) and all it’s done is show me how much I was subconsciously sheltering myself from the overwhelm of the world around me. 

After sleeping really well for a while, my insomnia is also full blown and being sleep deprived impacts my mental health so strongly. I’ve been taking rx meds here and there and I think I’ve found the right balance to finally get some rest at least a few nights a week, but the ones where I toss and turn really weigh on me and leave me feeling frustrated, depleted, and completely lacking motivation. 

I was also not working for my first few months but wasn’t worried about money which made things a lot more breezy for me for obvious reasons. Now I am juggling a few stressful gigs which just adds to my complex emotions of the moment. 

TL;DR I’m out of the pink cloud of my initial sobriety and it’s showing me more of the deep seated reasons I relied on weed so heavily, but I’m feeling disappointed by that and having a hard time coping with how I feel/dealing with the intensity of my emotions without relying the on the dulling effects of weed.

i dunno, i feel like i have an addictive personality, when i quit weed I started drinking beer more heavily, and while that did sort of get down to more normal levels, but its still not great that i feel i need to do SOMETHING, and if i go totally cold on both of those then It just builds up inside me that I'm not going to be sober for every second for the rest of my life

I quit weed last Jan. 2021 after near daily use for more than 20y. I had a 3w relapse over the summer but am now 60+ days clean and clear and emerging from the fog. All of this has me reflecting on how I got here and what I need to do to heal:

- I was born an older child in a big family
- This led to not feeling seen or heard as a child
- That feeling turned to frustration and a sense of aloneness as a teenager
- Weed muted that frustration and gave me an identity and a group to belong to
- I became dependent on weed to socialize comfortably
- When I couldn’t use weed while socializing (often in the early aughts, pre-pens and legalization), I’d drink
- By my mid-20s, chronic weed use led to anxiety issues 
- Anxiety issues led to prescription medications 
- Prescription medications led to repeated blackouts while drinking and increasing worse hangovers 
- Repeated blackouts led to booze sobriety at age 38
- Becoming sober from booze let me drop the Rx meds 
- Weaning off Rx meds made me want more sobriety
- So I quit smoking weed 
- Which eased my anxiety tremendously 
- I subsequently got more into yoga & meditation
- Now I’m healing that inner child and helping her feel heard and seen 
- And I no longer feel frustrated or alone

But it took 20+ years to get here and I’m now within 6m of turning 40. I smoked through my college years, my 20s, and nearly all of my 30s. My kids baby years passed in a daze and I look stoned in a lot of pics from those years.

I never drunk alcohol in my life and never will, so weed was the only thing I done that takes me out of being sober.

We soon realise it destroys us in more ways then helps us.

We soon realise how angry we become when we dont have any or the plug hasn't got any.

I quit in the past before, longest being a whole year and other times for a month or 6 months.

I really hope I can stay off it for good, and today I will hopefully have my last spliff, and live the rest of my life sober, just how I did when I was a child.

I'm 32 now, started smoking at 13, daily at 15.. So yeah, roughly 20 years of my life I was basicly just hanging around on my couch and smoking one joint after another. Just doing the absolutely essential stuff to avoid problems with government and stuff (paying taxes ect.), and even this only with big discipline...

I never had real problems with it, I just built my lifestyle around my couch and the spliff and it kind of worked.. I never had problems in my jobs really and the fact that I was a loner and never really had anything that was really worth a damn thing didn't really made a big deal out of my depression I developed (through weed abuse or things like that my father commited suicide when I was 10, doesn't matter)....

Last summer, I even got my dreamjob at the office of a nice head-/growshop, where I can smoke all day long.... It was amazing, the perfect fit for my lifestyle around my addiction! 

Then, a few weeks later, I met my girlfriend, and it dramaticly turned my life into the better... I was the happiest man alive, as she was and still is my absolute dream girl...! :) all just went pefect.. 

..yeah, I could tell even more and more, but this post probably allready is way too long... thing is, two month ago, I had a mental breakdown.. I felt empty, without any emotions other than sadness... I started to doubt my relationsship and our plans for family and stuff for basicaly no reason, from one day to the other... and I had no idea why.....

two weeks later I realized, that the only reason I started to doubt the most beautiful thing ever happened in my life was, that I just wanted to lay on my couch and smoke weed all day long - which isn't a thing anymore when I wanna be a good father and stuff (my girlfriend doesn't smoke btw).. and I suddenly realized, how weed is the most dominant thing in my life (a thing I knew for long, but never realized this hard)... and how it controls any decision I make... and how it starts to get in the way of way more beautiful and important things...

long story short (too late, I know): after 20 years of heavy smoking (3-8g/day) I need to break this lifestyle and get the control of my life back...! I need to embrace the sobriety, get the fog out of my head and just get truly healthy..!

It won't get easy, as I still work at the head- & growshop and don't plan to get a new job, as it's a good job.. and it won't get easy for many other reasons - as most of you know... But yeah, I plan to do a lot of sports to help me sleep and get nice brain chemicals, to eat good and to get some more activity into my life in generel... I will read a lot and my liquid vape also will help a bit... 
I wrote a letter to myself why I want to quit with kind engourangements and did some work to change my mindset into a better one for getting sober...

I will stop tomorrow, or let's say, I'll start my new life tomorrow... I hope I'm prepared enough, I hope I can resist and embrace my new, better life...! 

No idea if anyone will ever read this.., if yes: sorry, my bad... ;) but thank you..! I just wanted to write this down and be a part of this community with other, same goaled people... :) sorry for my bad english.....

My withdrawal symptoms mainly emotional and Digestive.

Anxiety/depression thinking everything on my body is a ailment that is going to kill me.
Joint pain that has faded think God but random muscle spasms. Fatigue

What made me get off of weed was I overthink and always have a complex where I think the world is out to get me i.e. reading really dark psychology books or conspiracy stuff.

First week I tried to get off which I didn't make a connection was the intense stomach spasms, food going thru me, no appetite at all, had no purpose in life. I can eat small portions but I now burp all the time .

What has helped me and I have no idea why is oj when I'm tired and 30 minutes of brisk cardio and 20 minutes of training with weights will give me energy the next day.

I had to rewire my brain so I put my notice in at my job. I'm tired of working overnights. I used weed to get over a rough two years, divorce, loss of father and weed actually in the start helped me not eat so I literally didn't eat for 20 hours a day and gourged for four hours extreme fasting but when the weed made me want to eat the other 20 hours I stopped. I assumed it was the diet but now I know it's the weed.

It's going to be a journey but my girlfriend is a therapist in a foreign country in the islands, good food , hot weather and a active lifestyle. Hopefully I can beat this and get my mental and gut back in check.

I guess there is a silver lining I'm not going back to unhealthy foods after this either and it forced me to get back into a gym whichwill make me live a longer life.

Last night I finished everything I had left and threw each half of my grinder in the dark at opposite ends of the field behind my house. That may sound dramatic but in the last 12 years of a daily habit, I’ve been known to dig through my bin to get it out. 

I’m not going to lie, I’m scared. I’ve been cutting down for a few weeks to build up to this but every time I’ve woken up and told myself “no more” the fear and panic sets in through the day of “what if I can’t sleep? What if I get sad? What am I going to do?” And I break. 

I really want to quit. I’m dating a great girl with kids and I’ve always said that I wouldn’t want to bring that habit in to a situation with kids. I’m not comfortable progressing that relationship while I have a daily habit.  Financially speaking, spending over £150 a week isn’t a massive hit to my bank account but that money could help in so many other areas. And the daily habit, it’s bad. I work a manual job that has me awake early every day and my habit has me getting out of bed early just to have a smoke before I get picked up and then I spend the day trying to get finished so I can get back to smoking. It’s no way to live. A few years ago I would take a week or two tolerance break every few months but I havnt done that for a while. It’s hard to admit but I am completely enslaved by my habit.

Once the pandemic hit that turned into everyday all day with working from home. I finally made the decision to quit July 26,2021. I had a few reasons, but mostly because I had been suffering with stomach and appetite problems. I had tried pretty much everything to stimulate hunger, but the only thing that made me hungry was getting high, and I was sick of having to get high first thing in the morning just to feel hungry. 

I thought I would be so bored after quitting, like what am I gonna do at night? But it's been quite the opposite. I have so much energy and have been so productive!! I have more energy to cook and clean, more energy in the gym, and way more focus in school.

I thought I had really bad anxiety and labelled myself a very anxious person - turns out it was just weed making me anxious. I am back to my easy going, carefree self and it feels SO GOOD. Oh and no more eye bags either! I look forward to sleep because my dreams are so vivid and interesting, I didn't realize how much I missed dreaming! And last but not least, my appetite is back and I get so much pleasure from food again. I feel like a 14 year old kid always hungry. 

If you're looking for your sign to quit, take it from me that it will be one of the best things you could ever do for yourself. I didn't realize how miserable and depressed I was being high all the time, and how much it was affecting my relationship not only with myself but with my partner. My withdrawal lasted about a week and was pretty bad - I had 0 appetite and couldn't keep food down and really bad night sweats, but once I got over that week it has been nothing but positive gains. I haven't felt this good in over 3 years and I can whole heartedly say I'll never go back. This community has been a huge support along the way and I look forward to helping out others in their journey.

This week, I smoked twice. Once where I said “I won’t need to do it again anytime soon” and once where I immediately got the cravings the next day. 

I could feel the old habits just ready to sink their teeth in. And it reminded me more about how moderation is a myth in addiction. Never in alcoholics anonymous are they teaching “well, if you’re sober a month it’s no big deal if you have one drink.” 

And of course we all tell ourselves weed is not alcohol, not nearly as addictive. On a technical level we’re right but the truth is, most of us are likely more addicted to the rituals around weed than weed itself. 

My dad is an alcoholic and he always said the nights he would drink were the days he felt like he “deserved it” and wanted the feeling of the glass in his hand or the methodical nature in which he would pour a drink. 

I found myself missing the same types of things when I relapsed. I missed putting on some music, grinding up some weed and loading a bowl. I missed taking an edible and going on a walk while it kicked in. I missed that sort of excited feeling I got where I knew that I would be more relaxed and carefree after my ritual was over. 

Anything can be addictive. My addiction isn’t the same as anyone else’s but it’s still an addiction, and the myth of moderation is how my addiction tries to get me back to my rituals. 

I’m going to try to fall in love with my sober rituals this month. Wish me luck.",23,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45369372}"

Will I ever go back to feeling normal?,"So I started smoking around November 2020. I smoked heavily from then until July- and little bit into August. I decided to stop because my memory was becoming horrible, I was feeling shitty about myself and about depending on it, and overall, I thought it was helping with my anxiety, even though long term it was making it worse. 

August 23rd I decided to finally cut back and quit cold turkey. The first 2 weeks were hell, as I experienced heavy brain fog, disassociation, anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations, mood swings. It was just terrible. 

Little by little I felt things get a little better until around September 15, I was in a situation where I was tempted to smoke. And I did. I took the tiniest hit off of a pen from my friend. It barely got me high, let alone buzzed. I hated it. I felt guilty and disgusted with myself and I felt like I lost all my progress. Regardless I pushed through. I finished all of September without smoking again. 

Last night, October 1st, I decided to try delta 8. I had read that it was half as potent and good for anxiety and because it was not as psychoactive, I thought it would do the trick for my anxiety. I was wrong. I took 2 small hits, and though the high was different and not psychoactive, it still gave me an uplifted elevated feeling that I did not enjoy at all. The next morning I was very out of it and disassociated and foggy and extremely fuzzy. 

Throughout my quitting process, I have only “relapsed” these 2 times, and I definitely do not plan on relapsing again. I am however extremely concerned over my progress. 
Did I reset all my progress from the last month? Do I have to start over? It feels like I’m going through what I went through the first time I stopped, tho to a lesser extent. 

When does it get easier? When will the brain fog lift and when will my memory get better. I’m terrified I’ll never feel normal ever again.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7860559}"

Let's say I am able to smoke for one week, and then able to successfully stop. We'll put aside for the moment that I have never demonstrated that I could do this in the past. Is this a win for me? It seems like it would be. But it's not. Because now, moving forward, I will have the belief that I *can* moderate my use. And because of this weed will now be back in my life as a potential option all the time. It will be all too easy for me to decide in the future, ""hey remember that time you just let yourself off the hook for a week successfully? Why don't we do it again? It will be fine""... sooner or later (sooner likely), I will fall back into my old pattern of smoking all day everyday for months on end, and my smoking habit will only be further reinforced by the new found belief that I *can* stop anytime because, hey, remember that one time you did?

Being able to successfully moderate my use is a no win situation. Even if I do could successfully smoke for a week and stop, I would still lose.

Greetings - I have smoked weed all day every day for 20+ years and now that I am almost 40 with a family and kids I decided to quit after a recent health scare….my habit consisted of smoking from morning to night, smoking almost 2 grams of flower per day, mixing in my wax vaporizer and often times taking edible at night to sleep. 

Upon initially trying to quit I stopped smoking flower all together and used my vaporizer sparingly to help with cravings….the result was that I was totally exhausted (wanting to sleep all day long) and suffered from anxiety, high blood pressure,  brain fog issue, loss of appetite, insomnia, sweating at night, and sweaty feet for a couple of weeks….I had trouble getting out of bed and when I did I often times had bad brain fog and anxiety…..

Because of the brain fog and anxiety I got extremely nervous that something was physically wrong with me and I ended up quitting entirely about 7-10 days ago.

Since quitting entirely I continue to have many of the symptoms I was initially experiencing including:

- high blood pressure
- insomnia
- anxiety
- night sweats
- loss of appetite
- cold sweaty feet and hands
- some brain fog 
- lack of motivation (depression?)

I have also started to have some additional symptoms such as:

- pretty clear depression 
- pins and needles in hands (at night)
- note my appetite has returned 

Because of all of these symptoms and generally how shitty I was feeling I ended up going to the dr where I had a full battery of blood tests and a chest X-ray. Next week I go to the cardiologist for a stress test. Ultimately everything has checked out fine so far with the exception of having high blood pressure for the first time in my life….

The dr prescribed me some medication for my anxiety which has helped. But I was surprised that she knew very very little about marijuana withdrawals…I believe I was the first of her patients to ever deal with this. Since then I have tried to read as much as i can online but again there does not seem to be a ton of information on the topic and what is out there is fairly general….

With that said I wanted to check in here to see what everyone else’s experience has been. Specifically I have questions regarding:

- has anyone ever seen high blood pressure because of quitting weed?

- have any of you experienced “pins and needles” /numbness in your hands at night as a result of quitting.

- do some of you find that your symptoms come and go I.e some days are better then others.

- how long did your withdrawal symptoms last - I am prob 6-8wks out from cutting down, and have not put any THC in my body for a little over a week….it seems like what I am going through is lasting longer then the “experts” say it should.

- if you have gone through similar experience to me what helped? 

The good news is that I am getting my ass kicked so bad - that I now realize how much marijuana fucked me up and I am more determined then ever to quit. The bad news is I am getting my ass kicked over here - spend most of my time feeling pretty terrible - and am not sure what is normal and what is not…..

This has lead me to this forum where I am wondering wha your experiences have been. If this is all a normal part of the process then I will continue to work through it in the hopes of creating positive change in my life for the future.

Honestly though I am a little scared and hoping/preying this is all over soon….

I smoked for 7 years, only quit for a decent period once in that time (for 4 months or so). 

I’m day 6, I went on a 5 day trip away from home and had a plan to make this my “detox”, only mistake was not throwing my weed and paraphernalia out before I left. Flew in to home at 10am and lasted until bed time before I was like, well I may as well have a bit, had 2 cones (mostly tobacco because I was actually scared of getting TOO high lol) went to sleep, woke up this morning and emptied my baggie into the wheelie bin along with the bong, cone piece, everything. 
So I guess I relapsed but the weird thing was I didn’t even want to get high it was just because it was there and I wanted to feel that throat hit.

Since we're seeing a whole bunch of new visitors as a result of Sober October (welcome!) I wanted to clarify our policy, as we will be modding out some related posts and comments.

Sober October is about taking a break for a month. Taking a break to reset your tolerance or re-evaluate your relationship with smoking are great things to do, but we are a narrowly focused sub for people who have made the difficult decision that they have to stop for good.

As a result, unless you make clear that you are using Sober October as your Day 1 to a cannabis-free life, we'll be taking out Sober October posts.

As I say, breaks are great if that's what you want, but it's just not what we do.

The good news is that there's a terrific group for support with taking breaks and managing moderation called r/Petioles. They can help you make Sober October a success, and if Halloween comes around and you decide it's actually time to quit for good, then you'll always be welcome back to r/leaves.

Good luck with whatever path you decide to take!

Waves of sadness, grief and anger.  Sleep is still for shit, but am getting close to getting on a regular schedule.  I'll have a day here or there where I'm present and sharp as a a tack, but mostly my days are like today...a bit cotton brained and sluggish.  I quit alcohol 79 days ago after the same amount of time using (34 years), so I factor that into the whole 'equation'.  The good 'sharp' days give me an insight into what's in store for my future self...keeps me motivated.  Yeah, it's been tough but I kind of have the shittiest super power...my wife died of breast cancer 2.5 years ago, so this is an annoyance compared to that sort of pain.

That being said, I've been doing a lot of processing of grief and loss echoes.  I really needed to face it in order to live life again.  Why quit after using for such a long time?  I feel that I need to 'wake the fuck up' and start living life.  It's waaaaaaaay past time for this to happen...and seeing my wife die the way she did, I had a 'moment of clarity' where I simply said to myself, ""My wife is dead and you're still alive...you're wasting time.  You've wasted too much time.""  So that's where my head is.

I'm seriously glad to not be using bottled or rolled 'happiness'.  The cravings are largely gone, but I know they'll roll around again and I'll ignore them.  I'm certainly not 'healed', but I'm on a path and the benefits are already apparent (more even keeled, more present, hope for now, hope for the future, waaay less lung butter/hardly any now, decade long ear infection that's cleared up, dream life is off the charts vivid, better decision making, more empathetic, waay less quick to anger, fear is not ruling my life so much...yadda yadda yadda).

It was a rough start but I'm glad I quit.,"I am 2 years weed free as of today.  It wasn't an easy journey but it was totally worth it.  I was a habitual smoker for over a decade and a chronic daily smoker for the tail end.  I used to get high before doing anything, even when I knew I shouldn't. Going to the store, smoke a bowl.  Going to grandma's, puff puff. Going to [insert anything], lemme hit that bong real quick. I knew I had a problem but I couldn't control my urges.  Reality hit me after I went on vacation and didn't have access to bud. I wasn't even thinking about pot but every day without it I would grow more anxious. This continued for a week before I had a full blown panic attack while at a restaurant with my wife. I've never experienced a panic attack before this and I literally thought I was dying.  

As soon as I got back from vacation, I returned to weed. Fast forward 3 months of more daily smoking and I went on another week long trip with my wife.  Again, without even thinking about weed I grew more anxious daily until I, again, had a panic attack.  At this point, I recognized the common denominator was the lack of weed and decided that I could not let weed have that kind of control over me.  With that in mind, as soon as I got home from that trip, I smoked for two days straight.  On day 3, I woke up and had looked at myself in the mirror and saw me for the weak willed loser I had become.  Later that day, I decided to quit weed for good (queue panic attack number 3).  

The first three months of my journey were filled with anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, no sleep, headaches, irritability and several other symptoms.  I was obsessed with my symptoms and thought they would never go away.  In spite of that, I stayed strong and did not smoke. As time continued to pass, it got easier.  As months passed, I would have the occasional flair up of strong withdrawal symptoms (thanks PAWS). However, as more time passed these waves became less intense and less regular.  By the end of year 1 these waves were nearly gone and would only resurface after times of high stress.   

After 2 years these abnormal waves are nonexistent.  I am glad to say I decided to quit weed. Since quitting, I've become more happy and fulfilled in my life.  I've achieved things that I would never have been possible when high all the time. As of 3 months ago, my wife had our first baby and, in spite of the stresses of being a new dad, I am the happiest and most confident I have ever been.   If I could do it, so can you.

Honestly this has all kind of been a blur. 
The first week was definitely the hardest for me mentally, I was dealing with alot of anxiety, had a couple panic attacks, tons of brain fog and derealization. Insomnia and night sweats prevented me from getting more than a couple hours of sleep a night. No appetite, and just all around a rollercoaster. 
The last few days, I have seen improvement in alot of these areas. Upon reading alot of suggestions on here, I started riding my exercise bike for an hour a day to get a good sweat in about 4 days ago. This seems to boost my mood for a couple hours. My anxiety is definitely still there in the form of racing/repetitive/intrusive thoughts. My appetite has gotten a little better, sometimes I still have to force it and other times I get legitimately hungry.
I am pretty lethargic and uninterested in doing much throughout the day, even the things I know I love doing. 
The brain fog comes and goes but I have been able to concentrate and focus better these last couple days. The thing I am struggling with the most right now is insomnia. It's been there since the beginning and it's not getting much better. I'm not sweating as much throughout the night, but I'm not really sleeping either. I've tried a nightly routine and drinking some camomile/lavender tea. I do seem to be able to fall asleep initially but it only lasts for a couple hours then I am up with crazy anxiety and a mind that just won't shut off. I've tried meditation but it's honestly so hard to focus when I'm in that state. If I happen to fall back asleep, it's very short lived and the cycle repeats. There have been a couple nights where I do not get more than 1-2 hours. Those nights are typically followed by one where I can get 5 or so hours but never more than that. I can't help but think the lack of sleep is responsible for my lethargy/brain fog, and other mental symptoms at this point. I have seen alot of progress in every other area so I am hopeful to start seeing some here as well. It's just exhausting and frustrating to know I need sleep and not be able to get it. If anyone has any tips or insight as to how long this may last, it would be extremely helpful and at the minimum give me some peace of mind.

Ever have a pet die on you? How does that feel a year later? It's not good. I'm not over it just because a year passed. I miss them. I want my beloved pet that lived through 25 years with me back. But they are gone, and I have to accept it, and it just makes me sad and mad. I don't feel better that "" Now I'm free to go on vacation when I like"" or some other BS. I want my damn pet back. I don't care about the ""positives"". 

&#x200B;

I have done deep dives on many occasions over the last year to determine why I started smoking in the first place and actually I figured that out. The pressures of life at that time and hopelessness about my future caused me to start smoking.  Of course things turned out great, so all that stress 25 years ago was for nothing anyways. I don't think I would have thought about that part of my life so much if I didn't quit. 

&#x200B;

Despite all of this I'm going to remain sober, because weed gives me good feelings for essentially no effort, and I can't live like that anymore. I'm really trying to make exercising and making music fun again, my two favorite things to do when high. Maybe I need more time.

I'm not trying to sugar coat this or motivate anyone with my experience. Just venting and releasing my thoughts and feelings after 1 year today.

Advice and support are very much needed!,"(Originally posted this on r/decidingtobebetter and was recommended this subreddit. Reposting it here, with a fair few tweaks, since I can't seem to crosspost it.) 

I've known for a couple years that I'm psychologically dependant on weed to an unhealthy degree. I just... didn't want to quit. Even when I started having panic attacks around three years ago, the relief of the habit and familiarity of the sensation still made it ""worth it"".

The kick in the ass today that finally made me really give a shit about myself was learning about how particularly detrimental such an addiction can be to someone with ADHD. Just... Google it and you'll see. 

(Hell, y'all know that already, I'm preaching to the choir.)

I've been smoking regularly since age 15--a whole fucking decade. An very important, highly developmental decade. And I've spent the entirety of it smoking... what probably averages out to once every three days for the last 10 years, staying stoned for the entirety of the day whenever possible. I have no fucking self-control and I hate that about myself.

So, yeah! I may have given myself mild but permanent brain damage! And, Jesus fuck, that terrifies me more than just about anything. I pride myself on my mind and my creativity! I'm objectively a smart person! And what the fuck do I have to show for it?! What have I done with it besides let it sit and rot in a haze of apathy? Fucking nothing. My works-in-progress folder is so huge that if I printed it all out and bound it all together, the thing would more akin to a blunt-force weapon than a collection of art and writing. My finished works? About 50. Probably 30 if we don't count things I didn't technically finish and posted anyways. Christ.

I'm gonna do my best to start the therapy I've needed for years--I have the insurance and I can start at any time. I haven't had the self-care or motivation to do it, and as much as my husband has been supportive of me doing what I need to, I'm a fucking adult and the only person who can actually start helping me, is me. 

Maybe without the influence of constantly being stoned or in a post-high fog, I can scrape together enough gumption to start doing all the things I've been putting off--therapy for multiple issues, getting a GP and a checkup (I have not been to a doctor in a decade), getting my rotten wisdom teeth out, starting my transition in earnest... so much to do. Let this be my first step! 

For once in my life, I find it fortunate that I'm not financially independent (I'm a NEET / stay-at-home spouse.) I've sat down and talked to my husband about this and how, even if I change my mind later and ask him, I need him to be strong for me where I'm failing and remind me why I'm quitting. I've ""tried"" to quit before but, deep down I really didn't want to, and I would always end up telling him how bad it is in my head and how much I ""need"" weed to feel better. 

The only thing I could argue I ""need"" weed for are my periods, because no painkiller works for them. I'm fairly certain I have mild endometriosis. Oh, right, gyno appointment, another thing for the list... and another reason to avoid weed, so I can focus on doing something about the illness instead of the symptoms. 

Any advice for quitting would be very helpful. Now that I know yesterday's bowl was my last, I'm having serious cravings already, and my willpower... it's trash. I gave my pipes to my MIL so they won't be there to tempt me and so I won't get desperate and scrape the resin out. Honestly I probably should have smashed them but they carry a lot of sentiment and memories and I couldn't bring myself to do it.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9062402}"

I have been smoking almost daily for around 4 years. When I went away for a while for work or holidays i went without it for weeks or long weekends and I had no problem with it at all so I always thought I didn't have an addiction problem. I also told myself all this time that as long as I could get my work done and have a social live I didn't have an addiction problem. But when I got everything done for the day I was really happy to hit the bong to relax. For the last couple of months I always had thoughts that I should stop when I was high. I wasn't happy with the potential I could reach and I should just cut it out. I thought about that a lot when I got high, but basically ignored those thoughts when I woke up and started the next day.

Last week I got a bad panic attack when I was high. I was full of adrenaline, and I got so much anxiety that I could feel my heart beating in my whole body. I wanted to stop being high immediately but I couldn't. I even called the emergency line and explained what I was going through. The sweet lady on the phone talked me down and helped me calm down. I was so frustrated and embarrassed with myself and threw my stash and bong in the trash and eventually got to sleep.

The next day I was alright again and started to think that it was not such a big deal and I should not be afraid that I can't help myself from smoking if I want. I took my stuff out of the trash again and decided I should stop smoking alone every day.

Since that night I don't have any feelings of temptation and I completely DONE with it but I have this terrible pressure and trembling in my body. Sometimes I'm really conscious about the beating of my heart and it gives my anxiety and there's a sense of doom in me. 2 days ago it was terrible, I couldn't sleep but had no temptation to smoke or whatsoever. I got to sleep eventually with the hope it would be better the next day but the next day was also really bad. That evening I took a hot bath and that helped really good. I was really tired so falling asleep was better. The Calm app with sleeping stories helped a lot.

Today I woke up and I feel better but still the anxiety and stress come in waves and I mitigate it with breathing, I'm managing. I like to take long walks and exercise but that gives me stress now to since I feel my heart even more, it sucks. Why do I have such feelings now but didn't have any problems when I went without smoking for weeks when I went on holiday or work?

I should also note that I have stress because of a family situation. I'm realizing now that I had that for a while but smoking just masked it.

As I'm writing this I feel terrible because I did this to myself and I have so much opportunities and privileges around me that others maybe don't have.

I hope I can help anyone with my story and I would love to hear your advice to help with the anxiety and stress.

But something kept me coming back and slowly over time the true thoughts of dependence and reliance sunk in and I knew that one day I will and have to stop. I set myself a distant target (2 years to give up) as nearing deadlines create huge anxiety for me and I’ll get stuck in that loop. 
This past summer to autumn (U.K.) transition has been insanely hard, 2 colds on top of eachother and then we just had the dreaded norovirus- alas this bug truly prevented me from being able to smoke - nothing has ever stopped me before. (Amongst any normal human function haha seriously guys clean hands and masks that sh*t is raw). 

I’ve always said “now isn’t the time, I’m too fragile and i won’t cope” GAD, chronic depression, OCD, had a baby ~PNA. My daughter is very attached to me and just started nursery, I’ve just started uni, my living environment isn’t ideal for introverted me. Stress Etc - all of these are valid reasons to seek support and medicate - with the help of professionals - instead I just smoked. 

Anyways its day four, I don’t feel capable of achieving anything as I’ve always leant on something (smoker for 10 yrs everyday) but I was forced by germs and I feel like this has got to be the right time of that even exists.

I'm lucky to have patient friends who are willing to learn and to grow and hear me out. It really does make abstaining harder when people are constantly trying to explain what works for them and how weed isn't addictive, and how there is nothing wrong with having a drink or two. But you can't let those ideas and what works for others swirl around in your head too much when you know deep down what works for them will not work for you.

I know I can't just ""meditate on weed"" or ""set an intention"" before I smoke it, or ""shift my perspective/thinking around weed"" and then just suddenly be capable of controlling my use the way some people can. I know I can't just have a drink or two, at least at the moment. Even though my issue wasn't with alcohol, it's like one drink opens a little door in my brain leaving me wanting more. More and more of something I can't satisfy until I smoke weed. Which is really only a momentary satisfaction which leads to more craving of that more and more, that no substance can really truly satisfy, but that I keep trying to satisfy with more weed.

If you're quitting, no matter what stage you're at, trust what you know yourself to need, and your own experience with weed or whatever substances. It is so so hard to really wrap your head around addiction unless you've experienced it.  Don't take suggestions and advice from those who don't fully grasp what you're dealing with, as well intentioned as it may be. And weed addiction is real. So so real.

I know my routine pretty well. I get cued, I get in the car, go to the dispensary, buy the bud, come home, consume the bud. The reward is getting stoned.

But figuring out my cues is tricky. My cues seem so varied and vague. Boredom, procrastination, being sad and/or lonely, general fecklessness, feeling miserable over past failures, desire to augment enjoyment of various activities, are all true but too difficult to grasp in a pragmatic way. Sure, understanding what makes me feel what I feel isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I could unpack what makes me sad and lonely forever, and goddamnit I'll probably want to get stoned even more in the process of doing so, or because I have done so...and so here I am.

But I know of some more specific cues. The dispensary is closing in 30 minutes, and if I don't allow the routine to initiate then the reward is completely out of reach for the rest of my waking hours, and the day will be won or lost (depending on my wildly oscillating point of view.) The fact that I have been sober all day and this is *my last chance* is a major cue. The closer to closing time, the more the adrenaline pumps because I know, now that it's closing in 20 minutes, I can still make it if I haul ass with basically no time to spare.
