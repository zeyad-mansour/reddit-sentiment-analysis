And a bag with probably a 1/4 in it!,"I've been trying to quit weed probably for as long as I've been addicted, and tonight I threw out the grinder and storage jar that I've had through it all. I've half assed trying to quit on multiple occasions but my heart was never in it, I was just going through the motions thinking about when I could smoke again. My last relapse was after a breakup, and I've concluded if I'm gonna get over that and move on properly, I need to have a fully functional processing center. I can't be foggy and dumb. I need to be focused and unreliant on drugs that decrease my performance. Cannabis is entertaining at times but I can't use it responsibly, so I quit today. Thank you guys for being a community I can do this with. We can all overcome our addiction and through that have the strength to solve the problems we face that led us down this path in the first place. Thank you again.",11,0

I’m unhappy with several areas of my life and without weed I’m having trouble ignoring them. Being sober is hard for me, I feel near constant tension. I miss the warm, pillowy feeling of my addiction. I feel like my depression predates my weed addiction and effectively I was on prescription medication for 10 years. Now that I’ve quit life feels flat. My emotional state is a wreck, caught between anxiety (caring too much about everything) and depression (not caring enough about anything). I used to go on these long walks with a joint and my thoughts. Now those walks are lacking a certain dimension. It’s like I turned down the brightness on my life. My mind used to wander very pleasurably while high. Now it just focuses on worries. People tell me to ‘be grateful’ and ‘enjoy my life’ and ‘look at the bright side’ but honestly I just miss getting high. I told my wife maybe I am a Snoop Dogg like character that will smoke weed forever and weed is fundamentally part of my identity and she told me doesn’t want to be married to someone like that. I feel like I want to be sober and have a better life but life is so fundamentally flat for me without weed. Will time help? Is this temporary? I miss getting high and I’m struggling today.",6,0

Now i got my dreams back, i can do a lot of things in my day, i feel proud of myself, i can meditate longer and multiple times during the day.
This last thing really helped me out. Not only because i might have replace the urge to smoke to settling down with this practice, but also because now i am.not constantly distracted.

Like, before i was like this: i would meditate for about 20 to 40 mins - after that i would go out and smoke a joint and then another. And then another.
All these joints just reduced or eliminated the focus effect of my meditation practice, and i didn't realize that.

Now i am constantly aware and i really feel like my life is evolving. In a spiritual and ""material"" way. 
Sometimes i wonder myself if after a good amount of time i could try to smoke a joint again....but right now i feel like i shouldn't or thay i would betrat myself.
Though, i have this little temptation from time to time...but i am gonna take this one day after another so i might write here a post when the time comes and check out with you all guys

I saw my son turn 12 without sneaking off to hit my pen. Here's the biggest one, now that I'm sober and not constantly hitting the dopamine button my psych meds are working how they should. I couldn't have imagined how far off center I was because of the half gram(ish) of oil I was vaping every day, but I've come to realize how far away from myself I really was. My psychiatrist says it'll still be another month or so before I've completely reset my neurochemistry, but that month feels like a victory lap after getting through this summer.

11,2021-08-30 18:56:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/petalx/paws_hitting_me_hard_and_im_struggling_w_health/,paws hitting me hard and i’m struggling w health anxiety,"hey all. i’ve been about a month and half sober off weed, dabs, wax pens, and edibles. i’ve been smoking 5 years straight and since i was 15. i was smoking anywhere from around 5-15 bowls in a given day, hitting pens on top of that, if i had edibles available to me i’d do that on top of everything as well. i was the definition of an addict and abused it heavily. 

MAN if i could have someone tell me all the adverse side effects from abusing marijuana, i would have dropped it, or never even smoked it to begin with. i wish during my use i wasn’t so naive and thought to myself “this stuff heals and makes me better, how could it be bad for you other than carcinogens?” and boy was i wrong, because now i am in a world of hurt. 

my symptoms are:
- occasional shortness of breath
- head aches that range from being tolerable, to me being bedridden
- eating disorder (either eating too much or too little, to not at all)
- pressure on my eyes and sinuses
- random joint aches/nerve pains 
- swollen lymph nodes that don’t get huge but will also come and go in waves ( one behind ear, one under jaw and one on both legs )
- anxiety ( mostly health anxiety because some days feel way worse than others and some days i feel almost normal. )
- heart palpitations 
- insomnia 
- tinnitus (been lucky to not struggle with this one super frequent and it will usually go away within 30 mins)
- depression 
- mood swings
- gastro issues

i went to the doctor in the beginning of august and got blood work and a ct scan which came back normal and i was all fine. so the swollen lymph nodes i can only attribute to PAWS especially since i’ve never dealt with these issues or them before. went for a follow up w my primary and my lungs are 100% fine (thankfully enough). i still get so freaked out and paranoid sometimes bc of these and my anxiety makes me resort to the worst thoughts that i’m dying or have cancer. 

the only reassuring things  are this page and the uncommon forum. the more i read, the more i see people also dealing w swollen lymph nodes bc of paws. 

these have all still made my life a living hell. i’m only 20 years old and i hate that what’s supposed to be the funnest part of my life has become the worst. it’s my fault for abusing marijuana, and making it my crutch to deal w life. i’m not gonna give up and i will over come this, despite how shitty it may feel or be. 

i also quit nicotine a month before i quit weed so that hasn’t made things easier.

any kind words, reassurance, and similar stories would help a lot. i don’t have anyone to relate to about this in my immediate surroundings. my parents are weed smokers, my sisters are, and my brother has been clean his whole life. talking to them about this is always a chore cause they can’t relate to how i feel, and always try to tell me it’s more than likely something else or nothing at all. anything to keep faith in their special plant i guess.

take care all.

Edit: did a little more research and the two bumps on my legs could be absolutely harmless. a lot of people have them and are asymptomatic. they could be hernias in the legs but typically stay painless and could be helped with compression socks. thought they coulda been lymph nodes since you have a lot in your body. this is all i’d like to add",16,1

The past week emotions from god knows how long have come up. A few depressive episodes and feeling numb. Today I ran some errands and tried to read a book but fell asleep for 4 hours and was sweating a lot. I know that’s how weed gets out of our system, and I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with that.

I don’t belong to a gym. My diet has been way less and I’m skinny as is. I used to workout 3x a week and run.

If anyone has advice or wants to chat, please feel free to share what you’re going through. I’ve used weed to escape the lows but it also blocks the good emotions for me. This summer I smoked in the morning before even brushing my teeth, so I decided to really challenge myself and refrain for however long I can. It would be a dream to get to 90 days.

I am fine at work, I'm fine when I'm out with friends, and I'm fine if I stay busy out of the house. It's when I get home that I start to crave it heavily, even when it's not in the house/in sight. 

I try to stay busy with things other than video games; reading, projects, homework, etc., but when I do, I can't focus on it well. I feel uninterested, bored, and distracted. Then I get restless and irritated and feel like there's nothing to do! It's a pretty annoying loop. 

Is this just one of those things I'm gonna have to push past? I'm already prone to hyperactivity and mental restlessness so this just makes it worse as I won't have THC to allow me to calm my anxiety ridden brain down at night. Any tips to help the process would be appreciated, thanks!",4,0

It's been about 4 weeks since I quit weed for good.
It's been hard... My life has taken some bad turns and I've been super close to relapsing... But I haven't.


Anyway, I figured my weight gain was probably linked to my weed smoking as I'd snack a lot late at night while baked. I've read a lot of people in here say their appetite decreased when they quit.

I've had the opposite.

I cannot stop snacking. I just think about fast food and crisps and cakes all the time. I eat WAY more than I did as a stoner. I just can't stop with the snacks.... I don't understand how being a stoner made me less ravenous?!


It's quite frustrating honestly.

In my head I had a list of the problems that compulsively smoking pot has caused in my life. But the other day I actually wrote it all down.  

Here’s the list I wrote out (some items redacted for anonymity):  


* bad grades in college
* failed friendships throughout the years
* too many years of friendship with <redacted: childhood-through-adulthood friend who is a textbook sociopath. Seriously; I used the Hare checklist to determine that>
* being homeless
* quitting my job at <redacted: first job out of college>
* quitting my job at <redacted: first serious software engineering job>  
* being fired from <redacted: most recent job, even had opportunities to get into space industry via that job, which is my dream>
* living in shitty apartments
* not having health insurance
* getting that tooth infection (passing out without brushing teeth after nights of video games, junk food, jerking off)
* not treating it
* getting tortured into a burnt out damaged state (that’s a long story; short version is tooth infection hurt worse than anything else and doctors figured I was a junkie so wouldn’t treat pain; brain permanently altered)  
* tons of parties and get togethers where i was having a good time suddenly being full of anxiety and paranoia and conflict with other people, because I hit someone’s pipe or joint  
* rejection from various social circles
* embarrassment to the people I was with
* grief to my mother and father
* disappointment from all my professors and family friends and loved ones and friends
* staying in too many nights, missing decades of opportunities outside
* being out of shape
* injuries from being out of shape and pushing too hard too suddenly
* my knee
* my ankle
* my eyes
* the arch problem in my foot (all of these are from being out of shape, then pushing hard)  
* bad decisions at various <redacted: recurring big party I attended for a while> 
* some shitty friendships I shouldn’t have had
* being broke all the fucking time
* bingeing on cookies and other bullshit


The list was a lot longer than I thought, and there’s more to it.  

For many years I didn’t want to throw weed away, because I’d just go out and buy more. Instead I figured “I’ll just smoke the rest of this then not buy any more”. But last Friday night (or was it Thursday? Or Saturday? The days are a maze of haze) in a moment of alarm and clarity I took the vape cartridge I’d been pulling from and crushed the glass with some vicegrips.  

Next day I went to the dispensary and bought two more carts. Smoked them all in the next couple days.  

Planned to spend the last 4 days (Thu-Sun) working Uber so I could pay rent. Let Thursday go “oh well, three days out of four ain’t bad. I’ll just work longer hours”.  

Then I let Friday morning go. “I’ll start in the afternoon”  

Then I left Friday afternoon go. Each time I’d wait 3-4 hours until I felt perfectly sober, ready to drive. Then I’d feel the anxiety of going out into the world, and I’d say “fuck it” and hit the pen. Timer reset, wait 3-4 more hours to sober up then drive.  

So at about 2 in the afternoon I was sober from my late morning smoking. “Time to get out there and earn!”  “But I have to clean the car, and etc etc” So I smoked.  

Ended up not driving any Uber until about noon Sunday (yesterday).  

Ended my shift early, 10:30. Thought “dispensary on 36 at McCaslin’s still open; I’ll re-up”. But it didn’t feel good. I didn’t do it. Came home, went to sleep.  

This morning I’ve got angry messages from a client of mine (I’m also a freelance software developer). They haven’t heard anything from me in 2 weeks. I was gonna be in touch, but then I got high.  

And I’m afraid to face them. Because I know I have no excuse, no defense. I feel ashamed of myself.  

I know that eventually I’ll be back in the light again, back in the good graces of the world, because when I’m sober I get my shit done. I’m actually quite a successful guy, when I’m sober.  

But I’m scared. I’m scared of that moment when I’ve been dealing with my shit but then complexity suddenly jumps or there’s some obstacle I don’t know how to overcome, and instead of facing the anxiety of that, some part of me will decide “Or I could get stoned, forget all this, and spend the day playing video games. **I can afford a day off**”  

That’s such a common thinking pattern for me:  “a few hours won’t hurt”, “a day won’t hurt”, etc. But it’s never a few hours. Sometimes I’ll smoke “for one evening” and six months later I’m still smoking daily.  

I just wanted to tell someone all this. I’m afraid of the wasteland I’ve made of my life. I’m afraid of the easy exit from awareness of that wasteland that drugs provide.  

I want to be sober for the rest of my life. I hate this stuff.",9,2

Today is the second day I'm going to be sober as I've been having some negative side effects ( no appetite/weight loss/ increased anxiety) from smoking now. Ive lost about 30 pounds in 6 months which is not good as I'm really petite. I  smoked anywhere from 1.5- 2 grams of carts a week for the last 8 months. I've been smoking on and off for about 10 years (started at 16)  and have taken a year and up to two year breaks before. I started March 2020 and was able to quit from Oct-Jan 2021 but that was because I thought I was going have to pass a drug test but didn't end up having to take it. I picked weed back up in Jan because I thought I could just take one hit and smoke it on the weekends in moderation. I realized this was never the case and I spiraled once again/ became antisocial/just overall being toxic to myself and life. I know that when I started smoking it was because I was low and didn't have anything to keep my mind occupied. The past few days I tried to taper and prepare but since 9:30pm Sat night I have told myself enough is enough. I have been  waking up at 2am restless and stomach pain from all the overuse. I know this is all apart of the withdrawal/process.  Wish me luck guys this is going to be rough. If anyone has any advice to help with the withdrawal/ brain fog/foods or supplements that really helped, please send it my way.  <3",3,0

I was embarrassed to say how much I was using,(5 blunts a day on average) . It was the first time someone confronted me with the reality of my addiction and expressed concern for my well being. It hurt because I knew I had a problem but I couldn't bring myself to quit. He asked if I knew of any support groups that could help with my addiction as rehab is quite expensive. I told him of r/leaves. I had been a member of this group for months but I left after multiple failed attempts to quit. I joined again,right there in his office. 

I knew I had better chances of quitting if I was away from my house.  I'm currently on a one month art residency miles away from home. I'm hoping to use this time to get myself off weed.  I can't get any weed here. I don't know anyone here. I did not bring any with me. It's my first day today without smoking. I want to scream from all the cravings but knowing there's no option I'll have to ride it out. 
I wanted to post this as an accountability to myself and to the supportive members of this community on a similar path to sobriety. Here's to a better life I hope.

31,2021-08-30 11:25:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pekafm/my_keys_to_stopping/,My keys to stopping,"I'm 41 and about 15 months free of weed after daily smoking since I was about 16. 

There were many attempts to stop along the weed, all failed and in retrospect I never *really* wanted to stop any of those times. Weed played havock on my mental health especially, nothing clinical, but prolonged periods of mild depression, lack of ambition and the worst of all was a LOT of negative thinking about myself, my life and the affect my use of weed had on those who love me.

I thought my situation was hopeless and at some point along the way I resigned to what I believed was a fact that I'd just be a life long stoner and could never change. It was very frustrating, it took a ton of energy and I felt defeated. Part of me wanted to be a stoner but most of me wanted to stop but I just viewed it as an unrealistic fantasy for a long, long time.

After watching decades of my life go by, stoned and finally turning 40 I hit a turning point in my thinking. I was by most measures half way though my life, or perhaps a little beyond. Did I want to spend the next half stoned, regretful and full of negative energy? No - I didn't. I was determined to find a way to stop. 

Below are the key ingredients that helped ME. Everyone is different and I believe stopping the use of a drug, including weed is a deeply personal thing and must be tailored, custom fit to your individual self and that plan has to be developed by YOU, because you're the only one that really knows.

**Stop identifying with weed**

I identified as being a stoner. I grew weed, I engaged in the culture, watched weed youtube videos, read weed articles, anticipated new strains, catalouged the ones I had tried, chatted with many about different aspects of weed. It was a big part of my life. I had to sever that connection and stop thinking about weed that way. We had a good time, but it was time to say goodbye.

**Focus on the future**

Instead of clinging to and ruminating on what part of me felt like I was ""leaving behind"" or ""losing"" I started focusing on the future. Where did I want my life to go? Where did I see my sober self in 6 months, 12 months, and more? Instead of viewing weed as a loss I trained myself to switch my focus to what I had to gain without weed in my life anymore.

**Accept recovery**

I had to accept what the journey of recovery was going to be like. I knew from past experiences it wouldn't be easy. I learned through other peoples experiences that it would take a *long* time. In the past I would always throw in the towel after a few weeks because I reckoned that if life was like what I felt in the first few weeks after quitting weed then I didn't want it. It wasn't until I learned that this was going to be a long process, my brain needed time to recover, I had to work on my coping skills and other strategies to engage in weed free life. That wasn't going to happen over night. This took a lot of patience and trusting that in time things would indeed get better (and for the record, they do).

**Commit to endure suffering**

Related to accepting the recovery process I needed to mentally commit to enduring any and all suffering I would experience in the acute recovery phase. I'll descreibe that phase, in retrospect, as the first 6 months. There were some dark times during that period but I was determined to not give in.  I prepared myself for a long stretch of not feeling well. It was what I had to get through, the price I had to pay for the situation I had found myself in. Just as a sick patient would agree to the healing process of their sickness I agreed to endure the suffering that would ensue as I healed from addiction.

**Effort in personal growth**

Personal growth was a big part of recovering. I feel like weed and the addiction to weed had stunted my emotional growth. Having had started when I was quite young I believe there were a lot of missed opportunities for growth of a personal nature. Developing a more mature personality. Learning coping skills and strategies to deal with life in a healthy way - without weed. I endeavoured to identify gaps and weaknesses in my personality and approach to life. When those were identified I found ways to fix that and make self improvements. I gave this actual effort and I view it as a life long process, continually trying to do better and improve.

**Cravings are thoughts but not all thoughts are cravings**

One important thing I learned through my process of quitting was about ""cravings"". In the beginning its unquestionable that there were cravings. I physically needed weed to feel normal, I mentally needed weed to feel normal. I'd think about weed often in the beginning, often triggered by situations and scenarios in life where, in the past, I would use weed. At some point after the physically cravings waned I realized that a ""craving"" at that point was more a pattern of thoughts, triggered by one individual thought that then spiraled into me being obssessed and fixated on the thought of using weed. A craving sounds scary but when I realized it was just thoughts and I had conditioned my brain to think that way over decades of use it became more clear that I simply needed to adjust my thinking and that a craving was really my own doing by allowing the fixation to continue. I know I'm simplifying, but I just stopped doing that through catching myself and redirecting my thoughts to something else, over, and over again.

Those are the key things I can identify that were important to me getting to where I am today. Life is so much better. I feel so free and at peace. I no longer have the burden of addiction and all that brings with it. Life is always full of ups and downs but without weed its more balanced and sustainable. I'm happy weed is no longer there bringing me down so low.

Good luck to you all. It's not easy, but its worth it.",312,0
32,2021-08-30 11:14:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pek2po/thats_it_now/,That's it now!,"tl;dr - Long read - I'm 3 days in quitting and have basically made it impossible to start again!

\-------

Hello! I've been a long time lurker on reddit. I was so happy to stumble across this group today while I was looking up withdrawal symptoms. So good to see so much of you supporting and helping each other over quitting! So yeah - I thought I'd join up and chuck my story out there...

I'm 40. I started smoking weed when I was 15/16. I started with 'lungs' - maybe just a UK thing... a 2 or 3 litre plastic bottle with a plastic bag covering the cut off end. You burn the weed with a little tin foil gauze, pull the bag out, and then inhale. Basically a poor man's bong. The first time I did it, I had just returned from recording a demo with my band and we were listening to the raw tracks so we could return the next day with some ideas for the mix. All great in theory. My guitar was slightly out of tune. Fuck my life... I had never freaked out so much. I felt like I was falling through space. The guitar sound became visible - some sort of weird gooey treacly dinosaur thing. I threw up, told the singer's friend (who I didn't really know) I loved her. Then I passed out.

I didn't do it again for a while - but we started gigging regularly. We were pretty shit-hot for our age, so we ended up supporting some decent bands - most of whom smoked spliffs backstage, so it was only a matter of time before I tried. I got into spliffs, as they didn't hit you like a tonne of bricks like the lung. In the UK, most people 'skin up' with tobacco, so I obviously got hooked on that too.

Went to uni - got into skunk, got into bongs. Got a rubbish grade, but had a great time playing music and getting stoned. Finished uni - moved to a student area, carried on getting stoned and playing music. No bongs though - I had a job, so I could only carry pre-rolled spliffs with me...

It all carried on for years... I worked my way up through my career. I moved to London, got a mortgage, got a job at the place I'd always dreamed of working... All this time I was smoking cigarettes before work and on breaks, and spliffs when I got home... My clothes stank. My teeth were yellow. I looked OLD.

When I first moved to London, I couldn't find any good weed. I didn't trust the 16 year old scooter riding 'dial-a-deal'ers. I'd always had good connections in my home town and at uni. At first, I started to substitute weed with beer. I actually still do. I need to sort that out next, as I'm starting to put weight on... anyways... I then started 'importing' weed from one part of the country to the next - just for my own use - but in bulk.

Once I'd established a 'few month stash' and a reliable plan to get more - I then started to think about tobacco... Why did I smoke cigarettes at work? I'd become hooked on tobacco, obviously. I bought a popular stop-smoking book and read a little bit every night through December 2019. I made a pact to stop on new year's eve (I also made a pact to cut down alcohol too, but I'll get there). Stopping smoking was a piece of cake, when you realise you can make weed brownies, right? Cue HUGE sense of achievement - especially with Covid being so prevalent in the news. (Spoiler alert - I still don't smoke and can't believe I ever did. Get the book - it will change your life if you want it to!)

I had a few bad experiences with brownies - mostly down to the fact I couldn't accurately dose them. It wasn't a massive problem at the beginning of lockdown, as I was a lucky fucker who got to work from home, and it didn't really matter if I slept in, or feel a bit (a lot) wooly - I could push through, get my work done, and spruce myself up well for zoom meetings etc.. I moved over to 'weed lattes', as they were easier to make and I reckoned easier to dose... I just put a spliff's worth of pollen in some almond milk and heated it up - and... yeah - pretty efficient way of getting stoned, for sure.

Lockdown was tough for everyone. I coped with sleeping in, and found a new interest in exercising at lunch or after work (until I got lazy). Oh yeah - and getting stoned every evening, as per. Fast forward 18 months to... er... last Thursday! Feeling like I'd 'put a bit of timber on' through lockdown, I decided to re-join the gym. I was a bit nervous going in the couple of earlier months when everything opened up again, as I've had a few friends come down with covid badly - and I'd done OK with a bit of cycling, running and occasional body weight training stuff... I was too lazy to push myself though - so I reckoned some spin classes would get me revved up again.

So - here's what happened last Thursday... Mega mega stressful day at work (all in my head, incidentally). Me and the wife (the wife and I?!) go to the gym to our first spin class since March 2020. I pound the living daylights out of the bike. Proper workout. Sweaty as fuck. I accidentally find my Vo2 max and only just manage to stop myself vom'ing. Quite handy actually, as my watch had calculated it as 10 bpm too low... We get home; I'm still stressed; I need weed; It's far too late to make a latte; I know it will keep me up late until I pass out... Fuck it. I make a strong one. We carry on watching 'This is Us' (absolutely amazing series btw). There's one episode you shouldn't watch when you're stoned... and that's the one that came on when the weed kicks in. My heart rate is about 30bpm higher than resting because of the HIIT spin class; the weed usually increases it by 10-20 bpm; the fucking episode I was watching.... ARGHGHGAHRHGGH! I thought I was going to have a heart attack - no lie. Heart flutters; chest pain; moments where I'm not sure if my heart is beating or not; forcing myself to remember to breathe; weird metallic taste in my mouth; lots of burping and weird sensations in my throat... My wife is a medical professional, and she also thought I might be close to having a heart attack. I told her I never want to feel like this again, and 'please, please throw away my weed'. She did. (she likes weed too, but the heart rate stuff scares her too).

I wake up the next day and sadly ask her 'did you really throw it away?'. She did. I'm both sad and happy - as for real - I DO NOT WANT TO FEEL THAT EVER AGAIN. I've had panic attacks before, but this was something else...

So, the situation now is: I don't smoke; I now hate the smell (and presumably the taste) of shitty street skunk; It's an 8 hour round trip to buy more good stuff - and why would I want to? I feel like I had a near death experience.

So... I basically scared myself into stopping weed! I've been having awful night sweats since Thurs and grinding my teeth like crazy. I know these withdrawal symptoms will go soon though - I've put myself through this a few times.

!

God, that felt good getting all that out. Next stop booze cut down. I've already noticed that the weed hangover masked the alcohol hangover!

Good luck to you all. It's brutal eh?!",2,6

I am a naturally anxious person. I stopped smoking pot 5 weeks ago, after roughly two years of daily abuse. During these two years, my sleep had become awful. It had probably become one of my main problems in life.

I would get baked and pass out in bed. I'd be able to sleep for a couple of hours, until I'd wake up. I would then need to smoke another bowl to be able to sleep another two hours. In any given night, I'd wake up around twice to smoke, sometimes three times.

I would also take non-prescription medication to sleep, but it would not really help. It still would take it diligently, but my sleep was still awful. One of the main reasons I'd smoke throughout the day is because I was exhausted, and was trying to take naps. It was just a very unhealthy cycle. Smoking to sleep, and not being able to.

Anyway, I stopped smoking 5 weeks ago and stuck to non-prescription medication to sleep. Surprisingly, I'd be able to go an entire night without waking up at all. Sometimes I wake up to pee, but that's pretty normal, I assume.

Yesterday, I ran out of my non-prescription medication. Surprisingly, I was able to sleep without it! I watched a movie laying down on my sofa and started feeling very sleepy around 11PM without pot or anything! I could not believe it. I went to bed and slept the whole night!

I know this sounds so silly, but I am just so happy right now! If you can relate, I'd love to hear your stories.",6,0

Here's my story.","I started smoking when I was 17 or so with friends in high school.  It was fun to laugh until I cried, and end the night buying 20 tacos from Jack in the Box.

As the years progressed, I used pot steadily, and had my most heavy use in the years during and after college.  I would be getting straight A's and doing a lot of extracurricular activities, which made me feel like it wasn't getting in the way of my life.

Fast forward to a few years after college and I'm full on smoking every day, multiple times a day.  I had a lovely girlfriend of over 4 years who was begging me to stop, but I didn't listen.  I almost took her plea as a challenge, and would hit my vape pen when she left the room.  One night in particular, I snuck a hit on the night of her birthday, and she could tell.  A few months later she broke up with me.

As if that wasn't enough, I drowned out my sadness from the break up with weed.  Every time I got home from work, my first thought was 'I deserve this.  I need this to relax'. I had no self control.  One bowl would last me an hour or so, and then I would need to go out multiple times to keep getting more and more high.  I wasn't even really enjoying it at that point, I just needed it for the dopamine rush.

The worst was the candy and snacks.  I lived with my parents, who kept a stocked pantry.  I would eat an entire bag of chocolate chips in a night.  I would fall asleep watching tv, wake up an hour later to the half filled bag of candy, and continue eating.  I had absolutely no self control, and I fell into a vicious cycle.  

I ended up gaining 30 pounds from my awful habits, and I would wake up really upset with myself.  Filled with shame.  And then I would smoke again to make myself feel numb, and the cycle would continue.

At the end of 2020, I resolved to stop smoking for good.  I was worried about having intense withdrawals from weed, so I took to edibles to help me taper off.  I'm now living with a friend (who is in the throes of weed addiction as well) and seeing him so dependent on it made me resolve to quit for good. 

10 days ago, I took my last edible.  I am done wasting money on a substance that doesn't do much for me.  I am done with the uncontrollable binge eating and shame.  I still have moments where I crave weed, forsure.  But deep down, I know I've made the right decision.

I've been able to read more books, and half of my day is no longer filled with lethargy and apathy.  I feel clear headed, have begun to dream again, and have lost some weight due to going on walks and not eating entire bags of chocolate chips.

I'm starting my 4th day without weed after over a decade smoking pretty much daily. The boredom is difficult and I'm trying to occupy my downtime as much as possible, even if it does mean just watching tv for a while. 

I find that in the moments that I'm unsure what to do with myself, or even when I'm actually *trying* to do something relatively useful (art, go for a walk, make food), I experience regular suicidal ideation - it's not intense, and I'm not worried for my life (I've been managing ideation for at least 5 years now), I also have a therapist (so please don't suggest I ""seek professional help,"" or to talk to someone - people in my life no know that I cope with this already and I'll be fine on a bodily-existence-continuing-into-the-future level). 

Rather, my issue is that it's so constant and distracting and limiting, I'm growing tired of it, it's like a whole new version of the brain fog I'm trying to get out of with quitting. I do think that I used weed to cope with ideations in the past because then I can just chill and allow myself not to worry about my worth etc. And this is making me question whether being sober is worth it if I'm just exhausting myself coping with this all the time.

Curious if anyone else has experienced increased suicidal ideation? It's hard to look up without being bombarded with crisis line information (obviously important, but not what I need), I just wanna know about others' experiences.

I'm now nearly 29 and nearly a month since I stopped smoking constantly (though have taken a handful of hits with one friend group). The longest I've gone without was just over 100 days, just to prove I could stop if I wanted to and not because I was ready to stop entirely, and that was about three years ago. Both my parents are/were daily smokers too and I used to joke that I'm a second generation stoner.




Now onto the point: over the last few years I've had near constant stomach problems. I'm talking gas, bloating, discomfort, and such loose stool that taking a solid shit became a memorable moment; ever hear the phrase ""pissing outta your asshole""? That was more common for me than a firm/solid shit.

I am about to finish my Bachelors in Composition, and I have a colossal ambition to enter and conquer the music industry. I am sure that I have the skills and the passion to go far, but my only real obstacle I impose it on myself.

I've been smoking marijuana daily since I was 17.  *I am 28 now.*

My dependency is consuming me, and there is no doubt that it's damaging my nervous system and affecting my memory.

I already went through the denial phases, where I told myself that marijuana is good and that it has benefits for my creativity as a musician. An argument that many share in my niche. But the reality is that although it does help, the imbalance between enhancement and self-sabotage is absurd, not worth it.

Procrastination and the pursuit of pleasure have me tied up, trapped. I use the psychoactive to amplify all kinds of pleasures. some include playing video games, watching television, and masturbating.

***So much abuse,  I am unable to stop ...***

I am fully aware that I have no control, shit's scary. I know it's bad for me, and I keep doing it, looking for it. I tell myself I'm addicted, but my actions betray my desire. 

There have been countless times that I promise myself that I would quit. Not exaggerating, countless.  
but I don't do it for more than a month, and then I relapse and the cycle is reset. And yet again, this routine of getting high.

I'm tired of not having the reins of my head. *I made this reddit account just to post here* and manifest it, carve it in stone. It would be heartbreaking to know that I didn't reach my goals because I couldn't stop smoking. Such a lame ass excuse.

***quit smoking forever? or, stop smoking for a while?***

for me, it cannot be temporary, it has to be something permanent. 

I have to reprogram my mind, change the switch. I need to heal myself.

It's time to say goodbye, *and it feels good....*

Wish me luck. :')",5,0

Before quitting, I had my system tied up in knots like a pretzel. I was prodromal CHS and avoided going over the deep end by consuming ridiculous amount of spicy foods for the capsaicin. I sustained this lifestyle of daily toking and spicy food consumption for about 6 months before quitting cold turkey. 

39 days since quitting and my digestive system is still figuring out how to crank food through my body without MJ or capsaicin. On top of that, the whole thing has my anxiety completely taking  over as I let every sensation of digestive troubles convince me of my imminent demise. 

I’ve been through the rough road to recovery from CHS before, in 2018. It was extremely long winded then (about 90 days) and I guess I was naive to think it would be different this time. Cramps, constipation, and disorienting anxiety levels.

All in all, this has not been worth it. I got back on the wagon to cope with PTSD and somewhere along the line got paired with a therapist whose helped me have confidence to cope without MJ. This time around I’ve had zero cravings as I continue to recover. If anything it’s pure resentment and fear of having to repeat any of this path to sobriety a second time. 

Last thing, in addition to quitting, I’m changing jobs, going on a big family vacation, fought off COVID followed by a mean UTI, and trying to keep it together for a side project. I’m overwhelmed AF. 

Thanks for hearing me out. I’m hoping this can help at least my future self to avoid ending up here again. Peace ✌️",11,1

I really liked how relaxed they made me feel without loosing complete control of my brain. I even made more for a friend and myself. So now I have brownies in my freezer. I've been craving them most of the afternoon even though I know I can't have any tonight. 

This evening I decided to do some research about the random drug testing in my state and fuck not only can my license be suspended, I'd have to go to court and could have a hefty fine and can even go to jail for 3 months. Because it's a criminal conviction I could loose my job in an industry I've worked in for the past 4 years and my visa status could be up for debate. My work can also drug test me at any time and their drug and alcohol status is unclear. 
I wish I'd known this before baking the brownies because now I have a bunch of potential life fucker uppers if I'm randomly tested between 24-72 hours hours after consumption. They might calm my anxiety for a bit but it's not worth the anxiety it's caused me since learning this information.

You will of course have to become patient with boredom and realize that it was boredom that was the true sign of yet another break through possibility in self improvement in true success, a success that’ll last, that you won’t fall into depression towards your later years.

Why you must stop smoking. 

Because you will watch porn. You have formed a connection between porn and weed. 
The urge is too strong now and the pathways are becoming more and more engraved each time
you relapse. 
Once you take away the porn, you realise there is no point whatsoever to smoking. 
It makes you slow, fatigued, lazy and unmotivated. All your worst habits start to appear.
And you fall deeper into the hole each time you fall. 

Keys to victory: 
- Keep to your cold showers, intermittent fasting and calories. 
It makes you feel amazing and super motivated. Keep making your bed, doing your washing and 
keeping your room clean. Small wins turn into big wins long term. 

- Allow yourself to smoke if a friend asks you. Not with Dad or your brother at home, because then it is too easy to start by yourself at home. Which WILL happen. 
- The thought of going forever and ever without smoking weed again is too daunting,
so yes, I will allow myself to have a smoke with a friend if they ask, which is a rare occurence 
anyway. By ""allowing"" this, it will help with the first few weeks, and by then i hope to not even want to smoke if I am asked anyway. 
- Yes i realise this is the addiction talking, but I believe my mindset will shift on this once i have gone a week or two without it.

- Just remember, once you take away the porn, there is no point to inhale smoke. 
By inhaling this plant, you make your life worse little by little each time you do it. 
There is not one single benefit. 

- Spam play league of legends or whatever else you need to do. 

- Go sleep over at **** house, get out of the house.

- Go play tennis. 

This is not hard unless you think it is hard. 
Your mind and perspective on something is your reality. 
You can shape your reality to whatever you want.
Believe it is easy, forget about it, meditate, 
and then ... It is reality. 

There is more to life than inhaling a plant. Yes, your life most likely wont change dramatically 
in a month, two months or even 6 months. It is about the long-term progress, delayed gratification
in combination with removing instant gratifcation (the combo). 
This small shift makes a HUGE shift in the long run. 

It will become easy as time goes on. You need to stick out these first few weeks. 

You know you can make it through 1 day. 
All you have to do is repeat that and 1 day will turn into many days.

You know what you need to do in a day. Get it done and it will be easy.",6,0

I feel like I can give back a little after struggling with quitting for a long time. A little back story- I started smoking back in college and and smoked almost regularly for 3  years in college. After getting a job smoked once in a while but started smoking again regularly after a few years. Been a cigarette smoker throughout and alchol almost all weekends and other drugs once in a while but weed was always a constant. 

Before a few years I realised that I cant go on like this forever  and decided to quit but always relapsed after a few days. Tried to understand how body and mind works and got interested in spirituality and meditation at that time. After going for a 10 day meditation retreat what I realised that all we addicts just want to feel good. What I observed was weed was very good at slowing the chatter of the mind down generate dopamine which makes us feel good. So instead of useless mind chatter + negetive emotions you get a quiter mind + euphoric feeling. No wander I got addicted  in the first place. But weed has too many negetive side effects which all of you are aware of. So what I did this time was replace weed+ all the other stuff with yoga and meditation. Which quiets the mind and generate euphoric feeling  in a natural way without all the side effects. I would agree that it doesnt happen overnight and consistancy and perseverance is the key. 
I changed my diet completely and changed my friend circle and moved back with my parents. Earlier what I was doing was trying to quit weed without changing anything else in my life. Every aspect of your life is connected everything has to change. I won't go into detail of how yoga and meditation works in the nervous system but if you are interested there are a lot of scientific research papers you  can look into. If you aren't into yoga you can try Chinese inter martial arts like tai chi, qigong or king fu Which works with the nervous system in a similar way.

So. The lowest point for me was when I was desperate for weed and raided an outdoor ashtray that had been rained upon multiple times. I collected all the potentials from said ashtray, dried them out, then opened them up to get the tiniest bit of weed. I don't think I even managed to get a single joints worth.

I mean I've cleaned pipes, smoked oils, smoked petrol stink hash, smoked incense that I was sold on holiday, scraped grinders into oblivion, asked friends for a single joints worth and probably a hundred other things I am ashamed of.

Like the craving is here some days, but I’m like “oh it’s that type of day”. I either workout or just pick up some brew(I try do this very little though). I noticed that when people offer me weed now I say no. Before I would take every dab/hit I could find like a fiend. 
Before I would just start smoking from the morning until the evening. Now If I even drink two days in a row, I’m like “I feel like shit”.I’m finally starting to go in the right direction & I really can’t tell anyone except you guys.

I [31f] am from California and have been smoking since I was 18. Before it was recreational, I had a medical cannabis card. In my mind, that meant it was ok. People in my family smoke. My friends smoke. My boyfriend at the time smoked. So, it was just normal. When it became legal to smoke recreationally, it felt even more normal and accepted. The fact that I’ve always been gainfully employed made me feel like I wasn’t the typical lazy stoner. In the 13 years that I’ve been smoking, there was a period that I was sober and it was only to find a new job - I went right back to it after I realized they weren’t going to test me. Looking back, I’ve easily spent $10,000 on marijuana and countless hours just sitting around being high. Sad? Just smoke. Happy? Just smoke. Bored? Just smoke. Pain? Just smoke. I got to a point where I realized I don’t even enjoy it, it’s just the thing that I do. I wasn’t even really getting high anymore. In the last few times that I smoked, I thought to myself “I don’t even like this anymore.” So why am I doing it?! Well, I’m not. Today is day 1. I unintentionally tapered off. I smoked less and less in the last few weeks because I realized that I wasn’t enjoying it and knew I wanted to quit. This morning, instead of a Sunday morning wake & bake, I walked 6 miles. I’ve NEVER done that before. My initial thought to myself was, “you deserve a blunt after this.” No, self, you deserve to have mental clarity, a fat bank account, and healthy lungs.",235,0

Information comes in and straight out

I don’t feel a need to smoke and I haven’t since day 1. I’ve said I wanted to quit for a long time but never really tried untill recently. I started smoking about 2 years ago and ever since i smoked almost daily, half a gram sometimes more. Until about 2-3 months ago it was horrible for me when I was not smoking, I was feeling very depressed and when I smoked it was even worse yet somehow better?? It’s hard for me to explain. But recently some things in my life changed and I started tring to quit for real. First few tries I was getting to about day 2, 3 sometimes 4. It wasnt the same urge but I think lack of activity because I was not working and had nothing to do. 7 days ago I moved to belgium with my girlfriend and started a new job. As I said I don’t feel the urge to smoke but yesterday i heard some neighbours talking about weed and where to buy and immediatelly got involved saying I want some to. In the end I disnt’t buy because the guy didnt show up but I was really set onto it and felt really guilty. Thing is, deep down I know I don’t want to quit and when I have an opportunity I know I will smoke even though I am not neccesarly looking for it. I also have no self control when It comes to anything btw. My real problem is another. I feel like I’m stuck in my head and also feel like im brain dead. I feel like I am just floating through life without thinking. When I don’t smoke I feel like I have no thoughts exept the thoughts that are deep down and I can bearly reach and are only bad thoughts about myself and paranoia and all that kind even though on the surface I look normal and calm. When I smoke I can reach those thoughts and i feel somehow normal and I can actually think and enjoy things whenever I don’t smoke too much and when I do I can’t speak and feel really guilty and sad and I have so many bad thoughts. I can’t concentrate on anything, my short memory is horrible and even when I watch a tv show or anything i can’t remember the names of the characters, i can speak to someone and next second forget the whole conversation. I know weed has those effects but i think i was like this even before i started to smoke. I feel really lost and confused. Is this the weed or somethingg else? Anyone have a clue what might be the problem?

Days!,"I believe it's been about 10 days since I quit weed, and while I'm still experiencing withdrawal and things feel ""weird"", I have the sense that I'm moving past the peak. 

Sleep is still weird, but less weird. I actually feel more well rested then when I was using weed now unlike prior restless nights. My appetite is starting to come back again as well.

The biggest positive I'm beginning to notice is a motivation towards goals. The first several days of quitting I realized to what extent I was using weed to numb myself towards my life, and the sudden reawakening to how little I was doing to achieve the goals I know I have was terrifying. It still is really scary, but day by day I feel that the fear is giving way to excitement.

For so long I felt like I couldn't be a person because all I could think about, every moment of every day, was how terrified I was and how much of a loser I felt myself to be. Those feelings are very much there still, but for the first time in fucking *years*, since dropping out of my dream program in college (I was deteriorating mentally) I don't feel like I have to live that way anymore.

Suddenly I feel excited and capable of chasing the career I'd like to have, even if only a little. My one true artistic love, playing and listening to music (sorry writing I love you too), is something I feel inspired to resurrect. I recently moved in with friends who are in a band together and we have an entire music studio in our living room, and my friend was showing me how to use everything if I wanted to record my own music and figure out my own parts for their band. I felt a rush of excitement just thinking about making the music in my head concrete and recording it, and for once that excitement isn't being washed away by self doubt.

My yearning to connect with others is back -- also quite painful at first as I'd forgotten how truly alone I feel. Over the last several days of being with my friends and meeting their friends I feel the potential to make deep connections again. My social anxiety isn't forever.

*Guys I feel like a fucking human again.*

My god, I took the leap. I finally took the leap, I just had to accept that quitting weed was the last step to doing that.

Thank you guys for fostering one of the best communities I've been apart of on reddit, I don't know that I would have quit without finding this sub. Your stories are inspiring.

And suddendly i realized one thing:
I live in an european country, where it's use to roll joints.with tobacco.
I have never considered myself.a.tobacco addict as i used to smoke cigarettes with friends but never alone and also nevere had craving for those.

But...actually, i was smoking 6 to 10.joints per day, and each one of those joints had TOBACCO in it!

So....maybe i developed an addiction not only to Weed but also to Tobacco....and that's incredible how i did not realize that!
I smoked for 10 years weed daily, but i also smoked for 10 years tobacco as well!
Of course i didn't smoke as much tobacco as a tobacco smoker (like 10 or 20 cigarettes.per day)..

But considering no filter presence etc.i might have developed a dependency on that too and it might be even more responsible.for.many body symptoms i had.

I was a fool! I didn't realize that!

Just some thoughts about this...if you put tobacco in your joints and smoke for a long time, consider that you are having withdrawals not only from weed but also for tobacco use.

It's no surprise I flew into the family tradition but my drug of choice is weed. 

I love weed because I loathe being bored, however it makes me foggy, clouded and absent... absent in interactions, absent in responsibilities and just generally absent with my life. 

Before weed it was with video games, I escaped into my screen and it was where I found my peace. However,  games became mundane and boring. I found enjoyment in my escape difficult and it become a chore. 

Like with video games, I'm realising my escape into weed isn't netting the results or progress that align with my goals. Ultimately, it's not the person I want my partner or children to look to for support or safety. 

I realise I have to fight for the vision of the person I believe is worthy of love. 

I don't think a person who smokes weed is unworthy of love. I just think a person like me, when I smoke weed cannot understand the love being given to me and therefore I can hurt people.

I've really enjoyed my time here as i've been with my girlfriend and have had a variety of stimulating activities to keep me busy everyday. With the exception of mild cravings the first few days and vivid dreams for the last week or so, i've had pretty much no withdrawal symptoms; but, today is my last day in Europe, and i'm not sure how i'll continue once I return to my home in the US.

I've really enjoyed the last 14 days i've had without weed, and before coming on the trip I told myself that it would be a fantastic time for a break and to clear my head. I want to continue now that it's almost over, because I think it's something that keeps me from being at my best (especially since I smoke every day at home), but I don't know if i'll be able to resist the temptation once i'm back; I have an ounce sitting in my drawer, and everything I enjoy seems to include smoking in one way or another.

I've been smoking for the last 3 years consistently, only taking breaks when I travel abroad. When I travel, it's easy for me to quit because I know that I won't be in an environment where weed is normalized, or really needed. However, when i'm at home, my entire social life revolves around it. All of my close friends (with the exception of my girlfriend) smoke on a daily basis and pretty much all of our social activities involve smoking. Whenever we get together, the bongs come out and we kick back and have a ""good time"". I skate as well, which I really enjoy with or without weed, but all of my friends who skate smoke and whenever we're at the skate park there's a joint being passed around. I rationalize that it helps me focus on skating and I find that I do perform at a high level when i have a slight buzz, but I know that I could be just as good without it.

What gives me anxiety more than anything is that once I return, I won't have many opportunities to be in social situations that don't involve weed. I don't want to socially isolate myself, because I know that will drive me more crazy than anything, since I really enjoy being with my friends, whether we're just having a good time or skateboarding. But, I really don't know how to separate myself from temptation. I know that if i'm around it i'll probably end up caving in. 

&#x200B;

It's driving me a little crazy; I don't know whether it's better to socially isolate and live in boredom, or to just cave in and skate and smoke with my friends. 

&#x200B;

At the same time, I also know that i'm holding myself back a little by telling myself that I need to smoke when i'm with my friends; but isn't it rational to assume that if i'm the only one there not smoking, i'll feel a little disassociated from everyone else?

&#x200B;

If anyone has gone through what i'm going through now, i'd appreciate some advice. I really think I would perform at a higher level sober, but I have so many reasons to rationalize smoking; and even if I  cut myself out of all the things that tempt me, I don't think it will make me happier than just returning to smoking.

Took me a while to sleep but felt great and did things I don’t do when high like spend quality time with him little brother and what not. Had a smoke yesterday and now I feel mega groggy and I got work and I cba to go in but I’m still gonna. Just grew out of this shit tbh. I feel like being your own boss in terms of nothing external holding u back and making ur own decisions and being in control of yourself is worth so much more than being able to get high. And I’ve been on the sobriety path before and once u feel better u really don’t miss weed. Aw man what a journey ahead. Good luck to everyone,2,0

I am currently experiencing my second wave of PAWS. My acute symptoms were obviously way worse but PAWS is hard in different ways. You get a taste of how life is without all of these horrible things and then PAWS shows up to remind you that you are still in withdrawal. My current symptoms are insomnia, waking up when I do finally fall asleep in a panic and feel like I am choking, heart palpitations, anxiety, vivid dreams, hypertension, pulsating tinnitus, and just days where I feel overwhelmingly pessimistic and gross. I am getting ready to leave the country for a vacation so this couldn't have come at a worse time but I guess Murphys law. I had about 2 weeks completely symptom free and it was amazing. I actually had thoughts of smoking again becuase I thought I was out of the woods. Im glad I didn't give in because nothing could be further from the truth. One thing is for certain though, the weeks I had symptom free are how I need to get my life to full time and the only way to do that is to remain sober. That will help when the cravings come back. These symptoms are not worth a few hours of forgetting the world. For the person out there that needs to hear this, you CAN do this. I know its hard and painful and everything inside you is going crazy right now but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I saw it. I lived it for 2 glorious weeks and I will keep chasing that until it is mine. It can be yours too.♡",7,0

I’ve been sober for around 1 year now and that’s so fucking awesome!!! I’m in a very different place than when I first wanted to quit. 

I have so much more trust and respect in myself. I feel like the time that I spent smoking has been unused long enough for me to recognize that it’s best when filled with something I enjoy. I’m ready to fill my time with things I enjoy. I’m ready to learn what I like. Smoking made it easy to spend time, smoking weed made it easy to do nothing. To have nothing, to not like anything or have a passion. I’m ready to discover what I enjoy. I’m ready to grow and stop making myself smaller and quieter. 

I’m so excited for my next chapter. And for that- I’m leaving! Thank you so much for being supportive of me and my journey, I really appreciate all the kind messages and comments I’ve gotten over the years. I’m ready to make a foundation in a more positive place. 

I hope this motivates you or gives you some hope. You can live without weed and expand your life too! You can live a life with enjoyment and with less burden. These choices come from within, and you have hidden strength. As much as you are immersed in weed, you can use that energy elsewhere in your life. The fact that you are so dedicated and captured by something is PROOF that you have those qualities, and what can change is the subject matter. You’ve got this. I wish you the best.

This is the longest I've gone in quite some time, and I feel quite confident in my ability to do without weed. That is not to say that I am not facing problems.

I have been visiting a Narcotics Anonymous meeting every day, and while this post is not meant to be a love letter to the program, it has certainly been the difference maker for me. I really avoided working the program until these last three weeks. By working the program, I mean connecting with the people there. When I was using marijuana, I found every fiber of my being was opposed to connection in any form. All I wanted was to be alone in my room, with my porn and my weed and my Monster energy drinks and my video games. Anyone attempting to connect with me would infuriate me. 

This time, connecting with people I was initially scared to connect with has given me the support I needed and the confidence that I can continue to live a weed-free life and work through the problems that drove me to weed. Tonight, I actually feel sad and lonely, and it didn't occur to me to call anyone until I started writing this. My sister is upstairs, and I thought about going up and chatting with her, but even now I feel frozen by that idea.

I have been a loner long before I started smoking pot, and that really disturbs me now. I truly believe human beings are social animals and meant to live in near constant connection with the pack. You can disagree with that. It is a reflection of my fucked up childhood that I have such a difficult time reaching out when I feel like this, even though I am well liked by my circle and have dozens of phone numbers of people inside and outside the program that would have a phone call with me. 

I saw a post on here recently about how 'what you replace weed with will make the difference for you,' and I'd like to add that it depends on what drove you to abuse weed in the first place. I've tried replacing weed with work. Or reading. Or other intellectual pursuits. But those things ultimately keep me isolated, in my head, where all my fucked up thinking and programming is. I have to replace weed with loving and caring connections. And it isn't easy for me to do that, even if my mind is willing. 

However, I know that smoking a joint is NOT going to help me. These problems existed long before weed was introduced to my life, and all weed ever did was complicate the issue further, as well as undermine my ability to work towards resolving any of these issues. Today I choose sobriety because I choose to work for a better future. I hope you can make that choice too.",7,0
113,2021-08-29 00:12:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pdohk8/my_story/,My Story,"Hey all. Figured I'd do this since I've never contributed my own post. I'm so much better at helping others and felt like it was time to put myself out there. I'm trying to practice getting a hold on my emotions and this is a test. If I can do this without bawling, I'm making some progress. 

&#x200B;

I had a rough childhood. My mom, for the first eighteen years of my life, was an alcoholic and had other serious addictions. In and out of rehab more times than I could count. So dependence is in my blood. It's always helped me keep off the hard stuff. But I think It's also contributed to my lack of self control. Or maybe that's just my excuse. 



When I was 16, I started seeing a therapist and was put on some prescription medications. But I hated the way they made me feel. After two months of therapy, my therapist had to move and I was to start again with someone new. I couldn't fathom that. That was when I started smoking. I felt like it gave me all the benefits with none of the downsides. I no longer needed to talk to anyone. What a stupid move but hindsight is 20/20. 

&#x200B;

In 2016, I met my ex girlfriend. She was the best thing to ever happen to me. We met at work and she approached me, which I'd never experienced before. She was the love of my life and she made me feel confident when I'd always thought really low of myself. When we were together, I felt like super man. Like nothing could touch me. I never hid my habit but I definitely downplayed my dependence. She never judged me and because of this, I never altered my habits. I spent the better part of our 5 1/2 year relationship numb. To everything. When we'd argue, I'd shut down and smoke up. As time went on I got better at it but always, smoking was my go to and it created this loop of escaping to my room to relax and smoke. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the end of 2019, I caught a really bad ear infection. At the time, I had no insurance and couldn't see a doctor. So I had no way of knowing what was going on. Whenever I'd smoke during this time, my ear would close up and it would drive me insane. So I stopped smoking, for the first time in 17 years. When that happened, all the emotions, all the mistakes I'd made came flooding back and caused me to have some severe anxiety attacks. Then, I started thinking of two times in which, at the beginning of our relationship, i'd fucked up and gone out and emotionally and almost physically cheated on her. We'd argue and not speak for weeks. And in my stupidity, I'd think it was over and self preservation would kick in. It was all I could think of. I loved this girl so goddamn much but being 28 when we met, I didn't know any better. I eventually fessed up to her and she dumped me. So now, I was quitting weed, had terrible health problems and the best thing to ever happen to me was now gone. It was truly the lowest point of my life. 

&#x200B;

All I could think of was how much I'd messed up. How I used weed instead of my emotions to solve my problems. And it broke me. I hated myself. Thoughts of off'ing myself, giving up and smoking again, I had it all. But I'd started the process and lost a lot so I figured, why not keep it going. It was a true test of my mettle and I got through it. Then 2020 came and the lockdowns started. 

&#x200B;

I figured then, with all the news coming out, that humanity was done for. We were going to start living in Mad Max times. I'd travel south, with my dog and meet my dad. Load up on materials and live life out in the wastes. So I figured, until then, I may as well be happy and picked up the habit again. After 5 months of sobriety. That of course, never happened. Once I started back up, between not working/lack of work once I started up again, my habit got bad quick. Basically spent the 5 days I wasn't working alone, in my room, smoking my life away. And from the time I started again to a month ago, there was little enjoyment derived from smoking. It was more a force of habit than anything. A way to, once again, quell the emotions I didn't want to deal with anymore. Last month, I got fed up and decided I was finished with this. Once and for all. 

&#x200B;

I'm now a month and two weeks in. I have this mental clarity I've never felt before. Now, I'm just coming to terms with life without weed. It's a tough battle but I'm in it for the long haul. Struggling to figure out what I should be doing with myself but I'm taking it day by day. I'm waiting to hear back on some volunteer work I signed up for and looking at my options for a new career. I've been working in coffee for 8 years and my passion for it is gone. Especially now that covid has ravaged my industry. 

&#x200B;

Not sure how concise this has all been. And I'm not sure if I'm out of the woods yet. But this sub and the people within it have helped me exponentially in the last week and a half since I found it. And I love you all for sharing your experiences with me. And attempting to help others have given me a sense of purpose I haven't felt in a very long time. 

&#x200B;

Thanks so much for reading this. Its very jumbled but I feel like I needed to do this to truly be a part of this family and to see where I stand, emotionally. I didn't outright cry which is a serious improvement. This time last week I was walking through the street and saw a kid hug his mom and I broke out into tears lol. So progress!",6,3

How would i react about them smoking in front of me? Tabacco and of course lot of weed?

Well, it turned out amazing. I decided to drink some beer,but beside that, i wasn't craving at all. I just wasn't. I appreciated the smell, the rite of making the joint etc, but i had no urge to smoke or ask them to pass me the joint (they know i quit).

After 10 years of smoking alone and with friends, even with some slight temptation of being triggered by that, i stood solid as a rock, i flew towards my feelings, thoughts like wind, and most important of all i enjoyed the time with my friends... even if i was not smoking!

I used to think that smoking joints was a solid part of my social appreciation of time with friends.
Turns out i can have fun without any joint. And that is amazing because otherwise i might have abandoned my friends.

It was a good testing, i feel i am really overcoming these 10 years and evolving into something more lucid, more mindful and therefore more alive.

I’m currently at day 42. I smoked pretty regularly for about ten years until I turned 30 and ended up stopping because of my mental health. I was experiencing bad anxiety and even panic attacks when I was getting stoned. Around the 3 week mark or so things got a lot better for me. I was able to manage my anxiety much better and I’m just kind of happier in general. And by “kind of happier”, I mean that. I still don’t feel 100% whatsoever. I’m sleeping better but still tired throughout the day and it’s not always easy to find motivation to do things. I also still struggle with self compassion but I’m working on it. But, things are still so much better than before and I’m so proud of myself for quitting. 

Some of my coping strategies include mindfulness, exercising, and eating healthier. But I’ve been slacking on all of that lately, but I’m trying to get back into the rhythm of things. 

I’ll be starting a new job on Monday that I’m excited about! I’ll get much better benefits and I’ll be getting great experience to strengthen my resume. I’ve also been socializing more with my former coworkers and it’s been really fantastic.

In an aquarium the balance of the water has to be right for the plants and fish to thrive. A right amount of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite and the pH has to be set correct. Because if pH is too high or too low. Fish die. Is the nitrate or nitrite too high or too low. Plants die. It has to be a in a certain balance so the ecosystem can thrive and the fish stay healthy and alive

And that’s where I thought, thats exactly how human bodies and brains work. You eat too much unhealthy food. You get obese and sick, so you get fat and unhealthy. You smoke too weed. Your brain gets in-balanced, so you het unproductive and miss life goals. You dont get enough sleep. You shorten your lifespan, you get stressed and moody. The thing is, with addiction or unhealthy patterns, were fuckin up our ecosystem. And thats with everything we do too much of, were fuckin up the balance. 

But there’s always a solution to the balance problem. 

- Refresh the water (getting rid of toxin in your body, go for healthy habits) 
- Give them less food to stop the ammonia spike (stop smoking or atleast cut it down to a bare minimum) 
- Treat the water with aqua treatment. (Go see a therapist doctor) 

And with a little effort in no time the water gets back to normal and will be super clear and durable once again. Happy tank, (body) happy fish. (Mind) 

We wont thrive long in muddy and cloudy water. 

So, for all you quitters, or trying to quit, going to quit, already quitted, fuck it im going for a better life people, go get your ecosystem back on track. The first step is the hardest. The rest is discipline. Go and enjoy your clear water my friend.",14,0

Last night I had lots of trouble sleeping and I ended up sleeping 3-4 hours. When I woke up I was not hungry and my pillow was disgustingly wet (night sweats). At this point I'm not sure if it's depression, bad mood or just lack of sleep/food. I know I have to be patient but this slowly started to overwhelm me. 

I thought of getting ""just one cart"" to help me get back on track, but since I've already posted comments here encouraging people to be strong, I felt like a hypocrite, you know, not following the same advice I was gladly dishing out left and right because I was in such a good mood. 

Anyway, I started doing chores around the house. I even got a bit of work done in the garden and cleaned my grill! Afterwards I decided that my hair was a mess so I fixed it then took a shower. The ""castaway look"" was getting old. 

This feeling of having overcome a craving changed my mood and right now I am considering inviting people over for dinner next weekend to help my mind get off these cravings. 

Thanks for everyone posting here. Words you share here make me feel part of a community where I can talk about my process of getting better every day, one day at a time and I hope these words of mine will resonate with someone out there struggling to quit. 

Have a wonderful weekend wherever you are my friends and thanks for reading my random thoughts!",8,0

I thought it was harmless. I mean hey I’m getting all my shit done. I’m exercising. My relationships are fine. But I guess at some point you can’t avoid reality which was that I was always thinking about when I would be high again. I didn’t want to see anyone so I could be high by myself. I didn’t want to speak to people and even if I was out I was high.

Reading this sub was just so life changing. All of your experiences helped me verbalise all of these bad loops I was in. It made me feel less alone and less hateful towards myself. Because I saw that I was not some degenerate doing this. Many normal sounding people go through this. It wasn’t a personal weakness. Reading this sub changed my relationship to weed. It became less of ooo fun. 

So I started smoking less. But I found that even one day of smoking created this snowball where it became a weekend then a whole week. So I’ve been sober for a week straight. And honestly it has been tremendous rediscovering myself. I am present in conversations. I am listening and genuinely connecting with people. I am funny again. I didn’t realise that over the years I lost this person. But I am glad to find them again.

I was an Insanely heavy smoker, like a ludicrous amount… I would smoke about 28Gs a week if not more from the moment I opened my eyes till the moment I went to bed..

Before the gym? Toke. Before a shower? Toke. Before you eat? Toke. It didn’t matter what I did I had a Toke before I did it, literally everything I did I needed to be high before 

It got to the point where sometimes I didn’t even feel high anymore but I would still hit 4 bong tokes just for the sake of doing it.. literally about every 20 min I would have a Toke 

I’ve tried to quit so many times but alway failed because I would convince my self to just hit a Toke, I have my own business and have built it pretty successful all well being baked out of my mind so I would always justify my use to that, I would literally sit in my phone and search up successful people who smoke weed just to convince my self that it’s ok 

I’ve read a lot of posts in here trying to get a feel for how everyone feels during withdrawal and certain techniques they use to at least get past day 1 lol

My biggest obstacle is that I live at home still, my mom broke her back and my brothers special needs so I need to be at home 24/7 to help them out… the problem is everyone smokes weed, so from the time I open my eyes I’m looking at and smelling weed all day everyday and I can’t seem to be able to stop that!",9,0

Contrary of what i thought i am doing straight and no craving.
I was used to wake up at seven on saturday, have a little vape, and fall in unconscious sleep till noon.

Though, this is great as i am not craving even if it is weekend (just started...we will see) to smoke or vape. 

My gf vapes a little to relax and get some sleep (defenitely not a dependency like mine). Well,i decided to stop the moment i bought kind of 40 gr for the month (i used to smoke like 50 gr per month before this 10 days). And i am so happy that she will be settled for a longlong time considering the small.amounts she vapes.

I litterally have in my sack this quantity, and.i do not feel any attachment to it or urge to smoke.
Contrary of what i should do, i left my grinder, filters and long papers around and strangely they do not trigger.me in any way.

I feel powerful against my craving. So.powerful that sometimes i ask myself why shouldn't smoke one or two joints from time to time.

Then my ""spiritual"" intentions kicks in and beside.reminding me that i use to smoke.one joint after another, i remember that i am building up clarity and wellness

I am also feeling kinder, with more light in me.

Last night i had a friend with me and i realized how much i only invited them to have a joint with me.
Playing games i used to play with him semmed kind of fun but also kind of empty.

Andi started thinking that if i won't be smoking maybe.i will.perceive time.i pass with friends ""less fun""
Don't know about this but maybe it might lead me to be solitary...

Well, this being said, it is day 10. I feel very much  better then first days, and i hope i won't have any more withdrawals beside insomnia...really hope that!

Can't wait to get some test in a month proving that i do not have thc in my system

Thanks to everyone on here of course, as always.

Knowing this about weed, I threw out all of my weed stuff (mason jar, grinder, etc.). However I was getting a bad case of cravings, and smoked some of my brother’s weed. I immediately regret smoking, and feel hopeless about my sobriety (I’m a recovered alcoholic and suffer from binge eating).

Just kidding, I got smacked with long term symptoms, first 3 months were the worst, irritable and depressed, felt like there were no happy chemicals happening at all.

Around six months, the happy chemicals returned, and most the symptoms toned down, but I’d still get waves that lasted for a few days to a week.

Coffee made it impossible to sleep, and gave me headaches, and even a single beer would give me headaches the next day. 

Only just now reintegrating coffee, but it still leaves me sleepless and irritable if I have it too many days in a row.

I think it’ll take me more time to reach baseline, I still have deep chest sneezes, and occasional coughing, unreliable mood, but over all way better than the first six months.

Long walks really helped as intense exercise made it too hard to sleep, it’s like I couldn’t relax after an intense work out.

Deep breathing really helped too, my theory is that long term symptoms are a matter of not getting enough air from so much tar in the lungs, not a doctor but seems reasonable, and focused deep breathing really helps, but don’t do it so hard you pass out haha, keep it gentle and slow, six seconds in , six seconds out, I do it for up to 30 minutes, really helps.

For all the symptoms I still experience, I feel a greater sense of focus and clarity and genuine emotional reactions to the people and events in my life, that feels way better than the high from weed.

I know it’s cliche, but I really feel the “high on life” thing they say, I think it comes from clarity and focus, it’s elevated my creative work and I feel I’m achieving new heights with my writing, music,  and video editing.

I started thinking, weed was like this magical ritual just like the other ocd things I did, and that if I don’t get it right, I have to try again the next day. I think it’s my brains way of keeping me addicted to weed. Sometimes I don’t even wanna do it, but the fear of bad things happening because I didn’t perform the ritual right when I smoked gets me to do it. And then there’s times when it’s not my OCD but I just wanna smoke, and it makes it worse anyways.

Has anyone had this effect of weed being interlaced with their OCD? I just need some understanding from others who might be going through the same thing.

Smoking was giving me major anxiety issues whenever I wasn’t high as fuck, and also causing anxiety whenever I was stoned (something I didn’t realise at the time) 

I was an anxious wreck, I was working part time and would spend more than half of my income on cigarettes and weed, cancel plans and be too afraid to pick up the phone because people would be able to tell I was high, I was failing all of my classes and my family relationships were a mess. Looking back it was very scary to see the situation I had gotten myself into just so I could get that feeling of escapism. 

The final straw came when I had been smoking and drinking for pretty much 3 days straight on hardly any sleep, ‘college life’ is the phrase I used to justify this to myself. But it sent me into a severe anxiety attack which changed my outlook on what I was doing to myself, it was the wake up call I needed but had ignored for so long. 

It’s been a year as I write this and the idea of smoking weed gives me horrible anxiety and honestly scares me, yet I still romanticise it regardless. My best friends are everyday smokers  and every now and then I think to myself ‘one toke won’t hurt’ does this feeling ever go away? I feel so conflicted. 

Overall though stopping smoking has completely changed my life for the better, my head is clearer, anxiety is all but gone, I’m in a job that I actually enjoy (most of the time) have a supportive girlfriend and my family relationships are… getting there. It’s been a hell of a year but worth it entirely.

Whilst lifting weights in the gym, I foolishly dropped the dumbbell on my iPhone 11, completely destroying it beyond repair, its also not insured meaning I have to buy a cheaper older phone online as weed took my savings. I think part of my carelessness was the side effects from my second covid jab, feeling fatigued, but also my mind racing from withdrawals. 

I was driving to my plug because I was so fed up and tired of life’s crap, but I thought how am I going to better off getting high at this point. I’m unhappy as it is, I have to simply tough it out sober and take each day as they come. Instead I drove to my parents who really helped me, and said they’d help towards finding a new phone.

Anyway that’s my rant, this depressive, careless ex stoner is still fighting and hanging in there, and so can you.

I feel so miserable, sad, and annoyed by everything. 

I haven’t been able to sleep at all. I literally feel so tired but my body just won’t let me sleep. I’ve dealt with insomnia a lot in my life but this feels so different. As soon as I’m about to drift off my body is like “NOO stay awake and think about smoking”. I’ve been trying to force different thoughts but I can’t help but think about it. 

I want to smoke so badly but I know quitting and releasing this control that weed has on me is an absolute must. I’m tired of forgetting everything, having no focus, and being unmotivated. 

I am in a turning point in my life right now so it’s like either quit and regain control of myself or give up on the things I’ve been working towards for years! The latter is not an option and it’s not something I should ever even consider. 

I’m currently 23 and I’ve been smoking heavily, everyday, multiple times a day since I was 15. At first it was to distract me from my hard home life, constant stress, insomnia, and nausea problems. But at some point, weed turned into a crutch for me. 

Now that it’s been 2 days I can’t stop feeling sad, angry, tempted, and anxiety filled. Honestly I can deal with the other stuff but the anxiety is so hard. I never realized how much I pushed down. I just want to run away from life. I just want move away from everyone and problems and just cry. 

So that’s why I’m posting here to hopefully feel better just letting this all out and maybe find some support. Sorry all for the little rant.",3,0

I  used to smoke about 3 years. I started using it for my chronic pains (  after 2 years diagnosed with spasmophilia that causes the pain) but it  became an addiction.

At some point  i used it whole day every day (always with bong), even when i had to  get out of bed to pee, i would take a hit to fall asleep faster.

Now  2 weeks ago i cold turkey stopped. It just didnt feel good anymore, i  actually felt worse with every hit i took, and it didnt help against the  pain anymore.

Now my main concern  is that im mentally 'crashing'.  I cant concentrate, cant thinck, space  out the whole time. It feels like im losing my mind, literally. When  people talk to me its 1 ear in, other ear out, Cant remember parts of  what i did couple hours ago. I see things but it doesnt get processed in  my brain.

Is this normal ? and if yes, how long does this phase take ?

And im always so tired, wake up exausted, no enery the whole day but part of that could be from spasmophilia

I  wish i could do any kind of sport to help with recovering but  unfortunatly anything that requires movement causes to much pain for me

Because the post is really only for me and isn’t a helpful recommendation that I have to pass on to the r/leaves community exactly it’s going to be long. In other words, by all means stop reading here and read something shorter, more specific and more concise… I‘ve just felt the need to fully and honestly appraise how I’ve gotten to this point here, today, for a while, so I’m going to. I’m also writing it so that should the urge come to undo everything I’ve achieved I have a written record of my journey right here that I will make myself read first (I do make myself read old posts occasionally so I trust that I would). I do additionally feel like posting it here (rather than writing it in a journal) does give me a level of accountability to you, my community. And perhaps it may help one of the 12 people who actually get to the end…

About two years ago your life was starting to *really* fall apart u/M1NDFEEDER. Your job was driving you insane due to the way you were being treated **because you allowed such treatment** as the job fitted in and around your shitty druggie lifestyle and your usage was pretty bad. Your plug *had* initially stopped selling and so you had an abrupt end to using. Or so you thought. What you *actually* did was find a different dealer and long story short, you got put in very dangerous situations repeatedly (the memories of which still haunt you) and got ripped off. So you had to go sober. Well…

You lasted 7 weeks or there abouts. The first few weeks (including the ones before you actually went dry where you stretched your meagre stash out cos you couldn’t face life sober) were horrific and you were all over the place. Physically and mentally. Your head was all over the place, anxiety was almost at a peak and you were a disgusting erratic sweaty mess. Moderation is a great way to spend your life basically perma stuck in withdrawal and boy did you try to moderate and stretch out what you had left. Anyways, after a few weeks fully sober, you *actually* started to feel okay. “Normal” almost. Of course, 7 weeks after your last smoke your old dealer got in touch…

The next few months were a haze. You blew it at work and quit just before they could fire you. It had gotten that bad. You woke up somewhere, months later, half-starved, dried up, hating everything and everyone and wanting to die. The CHS had even started to reappear. You were so effed up that you’d stopped buying food, simply wouldn’t leave the house to do so. You were just existing. You were suicidal. **You actually hoped you’d die in your sleep.** All day and all night thoughts looped in your head about how much you wanted to die. Somehow though, you found the strength to turn your dealer down the next time he messaged you while you still had a little left. You turned down the chance to add to your stash for the first time ever. Somehow. You decided to give yourself one last shot at that thing called life…

After a few false starts you got going on the 12th of February 2020 and you’re still going now somehow. Those first few days were filled with sometimes hourly check ins on your accountability app just to let all of the thoughts out and pass the time, complaining of being anxious, sweaty, lethargic, unfocused, being physically awful, you were still vomiting and so on… But that passed. In time. All of those things that appeared in the first few hours and days passed in time. You just had to stay the course. The memory of the last time being high is still vivid. It felt like the whole world stopped for a millisecond, before every thought ever thought by you got rammed into you head forcefully and simultaneously whilst having your throat constricted and your chest sat on. Not an experience to revisit methinks…

After that though, came the mental anguish. The psychological side of what drug use does. And the reasons behind why some of us use in the first place of course. ALL THAT REPRESSED SHITE. All of it. It was no longer chemically caged because *you* weren’t. You weren’t putting things on pause, putting them in a little box and shoving them down anymore. And sometimes it all came at you at once. 500 thoughts. All full force and screaming at you. “Why did you do that?!” “Why did you say that?!” “Why are you such a worthless piece of shit?!” So, so much stuff full force. Everything you had tried to block out or put away with chemical shortcuts came back full force and there wasn’t a damn thing you could do but sit with it and deal with it. It’s part of the process after all. That was far more difficult than the physical side to cope with. That part still exists. You don’t walk ten years into the forest and then right back out, isn’t that what they say? Paraphrasing obviously. Those thoughts of your childhood? Those thoughts which follow you around? Always *will* remain. But now they aren’t monsters banging at the door and you’re not hiding under the bed to get away from them either. You know their names and what they want, and that makes the battle easier. That makes that damage just a little part of your personality rather than the cause for a whole way of being and the shitty lifestyle that comes with it. The “fucked up druggie who feels nothing” persona. She was the fucked up druggie who felt *everything* actually, she just didn’t know how to process it all yet. She’s getting there now though…

I used weed to block out. I used other things to block out. I haven’t really blocked anything out for over 18 months now and I’m still alive. I’m going to say that again: **I’m not blocking anything out anymore and I’m still alive.** I can cope with it. I can be sober and feel things. Even bad things. The worst things. I didn’t think that would be possible, I mean I tried everything I could to not have that happen previously after all, including trying to kill myself…

Life isn’t perfect, but life never was. In fact it was downright hellish. It is better now though. And I hope in time it’ll keep improving. Incrementally and in ways that continue to surprise me. 

I must admit I do work on my recovery, I don’t think I’d be here now if I had not. My partner is also in recovery which means that being an addict will never be something that is forgotten about, brushed under the carpet or something we can’t understand each other regarding and so should never be a cause for hurt or conflict. I think that helps. Each and every day I accept that I’m an addict and face the fact I have this problem and I think that keeps me right. Keeps me honest. But this post? I hope I never read again. ‘Cos I hope I never need to…

I think I’m going to be okay…

Last night I had a weeeird dream, man. I dreamt I was prepping for a party, taking like easily 1oz or more of bud off the stems and bagging it up (not to sell, like as party favours? Idk dream logic). My plan was to bag it, then bag the bags in one of those big ziplocks but with this really adorable chill calico cat also in there to like 'protect it' or something (again dream logic). 

Anyway I'm sitting at a table bagging away and chatting to a group of people; my dad, friends from school i havent seen in a decade, a random guy. And one of my old acquaintances asks me if I'm gonna smoke a cigarette at the party, and internally I'm like "" oooo I do really wanna relapse at the party. All this premium weed, drinks, cigarettes, mmmm"" but my dream self is undecided, just telling her ""oh, I'm not sure at the moment."" 

So I finish bagging, go to put the cat in the big bag and realise ""hey, if I close the zip thing the poor kitty wont be able to breathe."" So I take the adorable purring fuzzball out and give her a big ol cuddle. And it's just cemented in my dream-resolve - I'm not willing to relapse at the party. Taking care of the kitty is too important.

Idk what yall think (probably that I'm crazy, and you wouldnt be wrong) and I'm not one for like serious dream symbolism or whatever, but it seemed like at first I was choosing the weed at the expense of the kitty, like completely focused on making it perfect, organised, totally obsessed with it, and then I just decided to leave the weed alone and save the cat.

I'm an immunocompromised nurse that was forced off of work due to the pandemic and concerns over my exposure to covid. Watched the world fall apart while I was stuck at home. I smoked and smoked and smoked to cope. Made a commitment to get sober starting in 2021. I've been sober for almost 7 months. Got a job working remotely working as a nurse and helping people, and it has been super rewarding. I've been taking really good care of myself, I'm up for a promotion, expecting a baby in about a month and life has been much improved in my little bubble. 

I noticed some breast pain that started a few months back and thought I pulled something with my new exercise routine. Went to the doctor for my first check up in forever as part of my getting healthy/self care routine and they found a lump. 

I'm now scheduled for a mammogram and completely stressing over the thought of having cancer. My brother died of cancer at a young age and with my immune deficiency, I'm at a higher risk already. 

I'm trying not to spiral. I asked my psychiatrist yesterday straight up for \*lonopin to help me cope over these next few weeks and he refused citing concerns over addiction.

If i will.pass it (or even if not), then i will be able to get an holiday week and also to.start.building up all hobbies i kept procrastinating, and i hope that those will be very useful to overcome possible cravings.

Like my most recent first day sober was the 21st of August, one day after my nephew's birthday. I keep getting thoughts of ceremoniously quitting on the 31st and having my 1st day sober on the 1st of Sept instead since its such a nice and neat number and I don't have any associations with the date. My birthday is on the 1st of Dec so I also like the idea of being 3 months clean on my bday instead of an additional few odd days. I also want to celebrate my sober date and not feel like I'm stealing my nephew's thunder so to speak lol.

The last few days I have almost relapsed because of this thought but have come up with good reasons not to. Also quitting on that date would be fine with my not working or having many obligations.

I know rationally it shouldn't really matter. I'm glad I've been sober and really it's just a number. Guess I should try to let it go, keep to the date, and try not to think about it haha.",3,0

Any I have been getting headaches on and off the past two days and my stomachs been a mess more than usual (it's almost always a mess anyway) I'll keep monitoring that situation and switch to a liquid diet if I need too. 
I'm not really feeling any hunger pains but I have scheduled my eating so I can keep in good health basically when my fiancee is hungry I also eat. And at work i just force myself to eat at my lunch break. 
Food is kinda lackluster right now and I dont really have the will to do stuff but I've been on a mindset change kick anyway so I already have plans in place to keep productive. Also my moods been all over the place and I've had these big moments of being really fucking manic or really irratible

But tonight it was wildly different. Met 2 friends i would smoke with, they rolled up and i couldn't resist, took 1 single toke. I could literally taste it, feel the high. It felt so real. In my dream i instantly remembered i don't want this anymore and passed the joint. Then i woke up, still feeling high. Took me a minute to realize it was just a dream and i'm still sober.

196,2021-08-27 04:27:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pcj89z/new_opportunities/,New Opportunities,"Well, here we go again.
Hey all, i’m here to share my story and to use this as an outlet to help motivate myself and others to accomplish cleaner & better life habits. My story starts at about 15/16 years old I’m now 26. 


When I first started smoking I think it was more of just trying to fit in and hang with the cool kids in school, I’ve always been more of the quiet type and weed let me express myself and let me just be more loose and easy going. Not that I really ever had a problem with socializing but I definitely have some social anxiety. (Don’t we all) 

Moderate smoker here nothing crazy however since I started I found myself smoking close to a gram a day usually more. Weed became something that was almost religious to me, wake up smoke, eat lunch smoke, get off work smoke. I found there where times I would wake up in the morning and reach for the bowl before a glass of water… 
 

With that being said I’ve always known in the back of my head I knew what I was doing probably wasn’t right nor was it really benefiting me. I just could never find the momentum to quit.  There have been instances in the last 10 years where I have quit for about six months, however this was demanded by the courts with regular drug tests, as my good friend Mary Jane had got me into some trouble as a kid. Eck 

Anyhow with all this being said, I find myself doing fairly well in life considering all the things I’ve been through. I am 26 years old don’t have much debt I have a 700 credit score & own my own home & 2 cars. Great job with big ceiling. I have a great support system big family, a loving beautiful girlfriend & Probably not the best group of friends if I’m being real here.


But I just find myself being stuck in a sick cycle with weed.I’ve tried to quit in the last several months at least several times, each time for me was the same I would go a couple weeks then say have a bad day at work and I would smoke thinking I’ll just cut back not a big deal I can control this. I was dead wrong. Addiction is a scary thing man, both times I fell back into my habit smoking 3/4 times a day. I’ve always disregarded my addiction and said things are always OK in moderation. But I definitely can’t moderate may use with with weed. It’s an all or nothing kind of thing for me unfortunately.
  
After moving into our new house about six months ago with my girlfriend I found the perfect opportunity to kind of hit the reset button. Clean up my diet hit the gym regularly take the dogs for a walk every day and just enjoy life. I was excited, but this really my first time living on my own in quite a while and  just having the convenience of having weed at my house in and all kinds of pipes and bongs to use it’s just overwhelming. I find myself smoking all the time. Killing my drive & any motivation I have set. I find when I smoke it makes me a very lackadaisical person, more selfish for lack of a better word. I’ve noticed it really take a negative affect on my relationships whether it be with friends family or my girlfriend. 

Finally feel like I am ready, I’m ready to do this for me. And I feel like that’s the key, of course we listen to the outside world and we listen to people have to say, but it’s up to us though to take action and take responsibility. Nobody can do it for you. My girlfriend has never really been fond of my habits but she understands why I do it and for the longest time I didn’t really know why I did. For the longest time I brushed it off as a habit or just excepted the fact I was a stoner. But that couldn’t be more far from the truth, in reality I used weed as a coping mechanism as a crutch to run from my problems and anxieties going on in the real world. And just to ignore my problems and past traumas. That’s the issue. 

Like I said though I feel like I am more ready now than ever. I wanna accomplish a lot more and reach my goals 
Weed has just held me back from becoming the true version of myself. So here we go day two now I will keep you guys posted & try to posts some updates along the way.

Peace & Love y’all!",5,0

Quitting has been so fucking good for me. I’m very motivated and the mental clarity is 120%. 

How I quit? I quit because I stopped hanging out with people who smoke. When it was a month, I told them I quit and I didn’t want to be around them if they smoked. 
Advocate for yourself. You can set up boundaries with people. Now that it’s been a month a bit I’m comfortable being around them smoking without any temptations.

I'm 24 now gonna be 25 in a few months, been smoking regularly at least 5-6 hash joints on a short day and no less than 15 hash joints (hash mixed into tobacco) on longer days. I slowly watched all my friends fall into the addiction alongside me, people I would never expect to light up a cigarette were rolling joints for me. We bonded a lot in that time and every time I quit they've been super supportive and would get mad if I asked to light up or someone offered me. But we all lived in our little bubble when we smoked up thinking no one knew about the habit/addiction. 

This time that I quit I went through a mild psychotic episode which was waiting to happen because I was literally up 1-2 days at a time and smoking throughout the day and late nights. My psychiatrist gave me another stern warning and said it's great for his business if I keep smoking but if I care about myself I should quit. 

Problem is how do I quit for good? I keep relapsing, I get better mentally and then I go back into the same spiral again thinking oh 1 joint won't be that bad and then that 1 turns into 5 or 10. I quit nicotine alongside hash because I thought I wouldn't wanna replace 1 addiction with another. I crave a smoke sometimes and albeit I enjoy vaping it's just not for me. I'm thinking about getting into cigars but I'm just afraid I'll relapse again if I touch anything with nicotine or anything. 

I don't enjoy it one bit, all it does it makes me paranoid and makes me feel like everyone's making fun of me or something. I still don't know why I keep smoking or keep going back to smoking. I don't even feel the buzz most of the time but yet I'd keep smoking. Idk what it is and it's definitely not peer pressure because we all hate it and if someone like me who quit shows up my friends don't light up around me. 

I just need advice for kicking the habit for good it's slowly and surely just sapping me of what little potential I have left. 
Also, I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms around 5-6 years (around the time i started smoking i guess) and I've been smoking on and off since then the longest ive been clean was almost over a year (14 months).

Raised by immature parents, constant fighting, been abused, dad is a severe alcoholic which I accept he's never gonna be better so yea based off that I always been a sad person who's always felt alone and hated everything. Got introduced to smoking freshman year, friends always had stuff and would share and at the time I never saw it as a bad thing, it was just oh weed cool everyone does it, well that mindset got me to where I'm at now, over the years I started using it more and I regret it so bad, when I was 17 I realized it really changed me, I genuinely believed I was schizophrenic or something but I accepted it as that, it made me paranoid, I couldn't retain any information, it dissociated/derealized me to the max, I felt numb I hated my own family I didn't feel comfortable in my own house,  I don't even know how I managed to graduate but it completely fucked me over in every way, for my age I couldn't believe how messed up I was but I always assumed it was the trauma but no it was mostly the weed this whole time, now I'm 18 with my gf that I seriously don't know how I managed to get, but it made me a terrible bf I was so emotional unavailable and all I wanted to do was smoke just to feel good I was so dependent even tho it made me feel awful, one week I decided to stop because I just wanted to lower my tolerance, it felt horrible but towards the end of the week I felt so much better than I have in years I couldn't believe it and it was that point where I started to realize that it was weed, but I continued smoking, my close friends who aren't really my friends kept me in that cycle it was just bound to happen until I fully realized what needed to be done, I started taking more t breaks often and I realized that I felt way better without it, I started doubting that I was schizophrenic because I actually felt good about life, I truly believe most of what I felt was drug induced but it was a slow realization, my gf broke up with me one day during a t break because I was irritable and said some stupid shit but hey I don't blame her I should have done better on my part and realized this sooner, the breakup really hurt me so I kept smoking to numb myself from the pain but I knew I had to stop, I only smoked 2 days after the breakup and now I been clean for 19 days and I feel so much better, I have a fair amount of knowledge about the withdrawal symptoms so I'm aware that it's gonna take months til I feel where I want to be, hopefully not years, but as of right now I feel great, the stoner haze is horrible but after these 19 days I don't regret a single day no matter how terrible I felt, right now I'm dealing with depersonalization/derealization, avolition, lack of concentration, those type of symptoms and yea life sucks right now but it's getting a little better each day and it's way better than how I was before just numbing and dumbing myself down for some plant, I can slowly feel myself coming back to before everything went downhill, I don't really know what else to say, maybe ill delete this but I know for a fact I'm never ingesting THC again and I'm gonna be happy one day so yea",6,0

202,2021-08-27 01:03:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pcgmks/one_month_clean/,ONE MONTH CLEAN!!,"hey guys,
I made it!!! (: one month. honestly I never thought I could get this far but here I am!! I have been smoking weed daily for the past 3 years and although there were instances where I tried to quit, I always relapsed because it was like second nature to me. Every morning my body would crave it and every 2-3hrs I didn’t have it in my system I had to sneakily get away from family members just to get a hit in the bathroom. Now that I look back at my previous state, I am not only realizing the expense to which my addiction affected my life holistically but the extent to which I was missing out on all the little stuff that makes life that much more amazing and enough of a drug itself (“I’m high on life”). Just being alive and present in this moment and being grateful to enjoy it all is one of the most exhilarating feelings if felt sincerely.

Listen to an audiobook, journal, work out, take a nap, make some food, go to the park, sing, create art. Just enjoy being. If things are getting really tough just remember that it’ll pass. Yep believe it or not, the day will pass whether or not you have it in your system or not, the day will pass whether or not you decide to be productive with your time. Time is a constant, flowing thing. Use your time wisely, use your dreams, passions, talents wisely. Use this one life you have wisely.

Generally speaking, the main thing I noticed is that we become addicts because of our constant need to stay in our comfort zones; to not confront the dark, shadow aspects our personality, emotions, and circumstances. We must however remember that leaving our comfort zones for spiritual growth is a hard task but only in taking that chance can we elevate our quality of living. If it’s a chance you’re willing to take, take that leap and never look back.",17,0

I just noticed that today marks 1 month since I stopped smoking weed.

Sleep is so much better now. Although the dreams are really vivid and intruding (I don't really like dreaming), I wake up every day feeling more refreshed, always a few minutes before my alarm goes off, and I feel the need to go to sleep at regular hours.

It's the morale side that is bugging me. I thought if I stopped smoking, my mental health would improve, but it doesn't ""seem"" like I'm doing better.

I really have mixed feelings right now, and I now can't remember exactly WHY I stopped. I just kind of know that I should've done it, I just don't get WHY anymore.

I don't plan on starting to smoke again for a very long time, but man is it hard right now seeing my friends smoke together, and being sober.",10,0
204,2021-08-27 00:33:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pcg71y/my_recipe_for_quitting_weed/,MY RECIPE FOR QUITTING WEED,"Hey guys,

I wanted to shared what helped me stop smoking in the hope that it can help poor souls out there that are where I was 26 days ago. Now I am not saying that this will work for you, but may be it can give you some food for thought if you are in the hole. Also, I wanted to document this someplace in case by mistake I fall again into that dark pit and need some guidance on quitting. So let's begin!

PS: THIS IS A LONG ONE SO CONSIDER IT A TIME INVESTMENT

PS2: Also feel free to comment below what worked for you in case I didn't mention it!

**STEP 1 - ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND IT'S CONSEQUENCES**

* Now if you are here chances are that you know you have a problem, if that is not the case you need to observe and see if things have gotten out of control. For me it became obvious when I wanted to stop and I realized that I no longer was in full control of my decision making.
* Signs were lying to family, throwing my stuff and go and pick it back in the trash, choosing to smoke to evade stuff, etc.
* (%) You need to observe and acknowledge  those consequences that came from your weed smoking habits. This includes:
   * Job related issues
   * Relationships you might have lost or messed with
   * Health issue
   * ...

**STEP 2 - SET UP A JOURNAL POST**

* Things were getting out of control and I needed a place to vent out, so I started this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/op06vn/this_is_the_third_time_i_tried_to_quit_this_month/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). No matter where you are with your goal of quitting doing this is a plus because:
   * It helps keep track of time (as you know we loose that when we are deep).
   * It helps document your progress.
   * It allows people to give you advice and encouragements

**STEP 3 - UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM (\*\*THIS IS KEY\*\*)**

* This one is interesting. I'll let you google some more about addiction but what I understood is that the issue more complex than just us making the wrong decision over and over again.
* The key here is to understand what influences that bad decision. Yes we have some degree of  responsibility because we ended up in this place may be because we fucked up but if it was just up to us we would not be addicted. The problem is the brain...
* By bringing THC into our brains **we inadvertently modified the reward system !** Think of it like a process running in the background of your brain. It's role is a bit like when you train a dog and it gives you treats based on what it wants you to do.  Except that it's more like what it needs you to do.
* Ex:
   * Boss we need food!! - *Brain*
   * I gotcha - *You*
   * Thanks here is a treat (aKa Dopamine) - *Brain*
* Now here is where we fucked up, THC hacks the brain and  triggers that treat. So the exchange is more like:
   * Boss you want a jay \^\^ - *Brain*
   * No man I'm trying to quit - *You*
   * Common remember how good it felt like last time! - *Brain*
   * I remember, but I'm trying to quit - *You*
   * (Any justification)  - *Brain*
      * This is the last one!
      * Today is Monday!
      * You need to focus for that assignment!
      * It's a birthday!
      * ...
   * Ugh fuck it alright here :(  - *You*
   * Here is some sugar baby xxxxx - *Brain*
* In the beginning that dopamine rush is like an orgasm from just 2 puffs. But gradually the dealer in your brain gets cheap and you might get half of that first dopamine rush with something like 5 joints a day. I know it's a rip off :/

**STEP 4 -  KNOW YOUR TRIGGERS AND DEAL WITH THEM**

* There are things out there that we have associated to the desired to smoke weed
* For me it was the relationship with my friends. I love chilling with the guys we had amazing conversations around joints but ultimately I realized that I could not hang out with those people if I really wanted to quit.
* I had to decline invitations, avoid talking to people, ignore calls and texts, because in the end my health was more important.

**STEP 5 - ACCEPT THE UPCOMING LOSS**

* Now this might not apply to everyone but in my case I am a graduate student and I have to be able to work full time on projects
* When I tried to quit on the fourth time that month I had understood that for the next 1 or 2 weeks I was not gonna be able to get much done and even if that would make me very anxious I had to take that loss in time
* May be for you it's work, may be for you it's longer but I like to see it as you investing that time directly for you. What is really 2 weeks compared to a lifetime.

**STEP 6 - NO MATTER WHAT /  GET THROUGH DAY 1**

* Never mind anything in the future or the past. Never mind the world. The name of the game is `no matter what`.
* This is where you use everything in your arsenal to keep you distracted as long as it is not weed or other drugs ofc. Keep it clean!!
* From:
   * Binging Naruto
   * Jerking of 5 times a day if you have to
   * Playing league of legends non-stop
   * Taking 5 showers
   * If you can, do some sports
   * ...
* `No matter what` the goal is to get through the day sober
* **\*\*WARNING\*\*** this will be like an itch you cannot scratch, a thirst you cannot quench and your brain will not be on your side

**STEP 7 - THE TRIATHLON**

* This is the stage where I am at.
* The next couple of days/ weeks / months/ who knows maybe even years will be like a triathlon. In case you don't know what it is, it's a endurance competition where you run, cycle an swim until you get to the end! The end here for us is that rehabilitated state that we where in before we started smoking.
* Well the triathlon is about navigating through the storm you generated by the lack of THC. Remember the treat -*Brain-* was handing out for THC in STEP 3? that sweet dopamine that made us go back to the well over and over again.  Here is where it bite us up the ass.
* The lack of THC (aka change in dopamine) will play with your emotions, way of thinking and desires.
* Instead of running, cycling and swimming, your endurance test will be:
   * Depression
   * Lack of motivation
   * Procrastination
   * Self sabotaging behavior
   * Loss of self discipline
   * etc.
* **\*\*NOTE\*\*: No matter how bad things become here there are services out there for free if you feel really down. People are willing to help so just reach!**
* Also don't be afraid! it will pass provided you stay sober. In fact unlike a real triathlon things will get easier the further away you are from the start line. Here are things that help:
   * Enough Sleep
   * Fruits and Veggies
   * No junk food
   * Sports
   * Friends + Family
* The reward system will gradually reset like a path created by people walking over and over again. Eventually if people stop passing by the grass will grow again and cover it, but the dent is still there so...

**STEP 8 - BE WARE OF BUMPS ON THE ROAD**

* Even if you are sober for a while and you think:
   * I am good now, 1 puff should be ok, it's just one joint!
* No! that's how we got fucked last time by -*Brain*\- so be ware of those.
* For me, it took only 1 puff after being 3 months sober to bring me back to a full on smoking spree of 6 joints a day :/
* The worst part is that every time you fall, you seem to fall deeper so be ware of that!!
* In case you do fuck-up never give up, update your journal post and follow the steps to climb back the ladder
* (%%) It helps me to have this rule when I encounter bumps in the road for damage containment: 
   * **NEVER NEVER BUY WEED YOURSELF OR ASK A FRIEND TO DO IT FOR YOU**
      * Sometimes you fuck up, may be its a party or a friend is smoking weed and offers you some and catches you on a wrong day that you say yes t\_t
      * well if after you go and buy yourself it will set a precedence and now you are independent and can get whenever you want. This is a no no because it is real easy to loose control at that point! 

Good luck out there kiddo!

(%) **EDIT 27/08/21:** Added this portion as suggested by u/mental_soup as it helped me too.

(%%) **EDIT 19/10/21 :** Added a rule to help with the bumps on the road.

Well long story short it didn't stop I got back into my old habit of smoking everyday. 1 year later no job, no ride, and I feel like Sh*T about myself. I tried to stop smoking but now it seems harder than before and I just can't say no to weed. Before it was so easy to stop but now I know I need to stop I just don't have the motivation to stop.

It's really difficult to really hear and accept my flaws and wrong doings in the past in these conversations that are actually taking place whilst Im present cuz sober.

I'm am willing to go through them but its extremely overwhelming. I told him that I'm going through a hard time so he should take that into consideration and be gently. He feels that he has been taking me into consideration for years and is fed up with having to adjust to me instead of me catering more to his needs for a change..

Does this sound anything familiar to anyone or am I just a particulare case.

Big part of quitting for me was to be more emotionally present en nurture my important relationships in a healthy matter. This level of reality thst surfacing is quite painful and difficult to maneuver. I'm really seeing progress in babysteps which from my pov are small wins I want savour. But I can't expect him to have the same reality or patience if things have gotten to far I guess.

224,2021-08-26 17:38:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pc97to/30_days/,30 days.,"Hello all,

I'll try to keep this brief. I've been checking this sub for years and even quit once for almost 2 months a couple years back before getting complacent and smoking again. I'm proud to be able to post here at the end of 30 days of a new chapter.

I've smoked daily for about 16 years now. I spent about 5 years engaging in ever escalating drug abuse during the heydays of the rx drug wave and the worse that came after it. I was able to quit that when my friend almost died next to me. But I kept smoking, believing it to be 'different' than that and not a major contributor to my problems.

Fast forward 6 years and I had accomplished much professionally but found myself isolated from my family, friends, colleagues, and cost myself a truly wonderful person and relationship.

The hardest part about actually quitting was needing to admit to myself and to others that I had a problem. The first time that I tried to quit 2 years ago, I opened up to family and some friends that my mental health wasn't great but I never told the truth. I think that sealed my fate to eventually pick it up again.

After finally hitting rock bottom personally, 30 days ago I not only threw out everything I had but told everyone who I know cares about me. It's wild the amount of damage carrying a lie, something you feel ashamed of, can do. It's also wild the freedom telling the truth can bring.

I haven't felt better in 16 years than I have in the last 3 weeks (week 1 was rough), and it's not just quitting smoking--it was telling the truth to myself and others.

I've gone longer than this without smoking so I'm staying vigilant. Complacency is the enemy. We've all been there...that voice saying ""things are going well, wouldn't it be fun to get high, walk the dog, play some video games, hang out etc?"" It could come a month or a year from now. But I know where that leads.

To anyone out there: talk to people you care about and who care about you.  It's tough doing something alone.

This sub was really helpful in making the move and I hope to keep visiting and contributing here.",5,0

I first found this sub while beeing stoned and full of regrets. I was lying in my bed, contemplating about how I always manage to lose myself in the weed. ""This time I will have control over it, this time I will not let weed become the most important thing in my life blablabla""

I prefered sitting all day long alone at home with my bong, while my gf started distancing herself from me, bc I am/was more addicted to weed than loving her. 

She often told me ""I know you're in love with the idea beeing high all the time and beeing productive, but it never works out for you!""

Sure enough I was getting mad about it. I wanted it to work out so bad. Deep down I always knew she was right. 

First time I smoked was at 13, regularly at 15, had a 1/2y break with 17 in order to pass drug tests, here and there a few breaks... 
I always seeked the buzz, got drunk at school, got high at school, fucked up my first studies because I gave weed and alcohol all the controll about my life, heck I even wanted to smoke before I smoke!
I got medical weed in order to have less paranoia while driving with thc in my blood (Germany is ridiculously harsh about driving with more than 1ng of thc in the blood serum) You pay 500€ as a fine, have to do a ""medical psychological test"" + 1 year abstinence (+2000€) and you lose your license:)
If you are medical weed patient you
just have to do some expensive reaction tests IF they catch you..

But it never helped me with the paranoia while driving. 

I'm 21, starting my 2nd Bachelor degree in October and finally came to realize I will never never ever be able to accomplish all the things I dream about if I won't cut addiction out of my life. THANK YOU LEAVERS for sharing your storys, I finally got the feeling that I am not fighting alone!

In the past whenever thoughts like these would creep into my head, I would smoke to distract myself from them but now I struggle to find ways to cope with them. Yesterday I took to self harming to cope which weirdly helped a bit but that didn’t last long. Anyways, the night ended with me writing a suicide note and leaving around midnight with the intention of not coming back. I decided to try calling a suicide hotline to see if that would help and I ended up talking to an operator for about an hour before I decided to go back home.

This did not stop me, however. Pot helped me go through the year, but was holding me back. By the end, I was smoking every couple of hours. My breathing had become awful, and I was tired all the time. It was time to stop.

If you look at my post history, you'll see it's not been a walk in the park. I still stuck with it, though, and now I am 30 days clean! This change has prompted me to make other important changes in my life. I cut off people who were taking advantage of me, and I am going to the gym regularly. 

If you're thinking about stopping but can't find the strength to do it, just know that you have it in you to do it. Throw all of your pot stuff away. The hard part is the first 48 hours. After that, you start getting better in terms of breathing and energy, and it becomes easier.

First of all, I just want to thank every single person who both posts and comments in this sub. You all are changing lives for the better without really seeing it, but trust me, your effort is making a difference.

I'm currently 26 and I've been smoking daily ever since January of 2011 (the second half of my sophomore year of HS). I started out with one session a day after school but quickly progressed to being high all day long after graduation. Towards the beginning of this year, I was smoking more than an eighth of oil a week, on top of random amounts of flower with friends.

I've gone back and forth with wanting to quit smoking, as far back as 2014, but I never could. After college I just said ""fuck it"" and really started going crazy. The introduction of cartridges really set me up for failure too.

Earlier this year, a friend of mine passed away. Though it was under sad circumstances, it provided me with the opportunity to meet back up with an old best friend of mine at the funeral. My old friend that I met up with dabbled a little with weed post-HS, but only a handful of times. Since then he's graduated with a Bachelor's Degree, moved across the state, has a great job and relationship, and is generally loving life. After the funeral, he invited me to his parents house (who still lived locally) for dinner. Once there, I couldn't even really eat dinner because I hadn't smoked since the early morning. ***That*** was the wake-up call.

A week later, I was no longer smoking.

My first day, I decided to keep my oil rig and bong for potential fun in the far future, but ended up caving and buying another gram of oil the next morning. After I blew through that gram, I threw everything in the trash. I've been successful ever since.

The first few weeks were rough, mainly from the lack of sleep and appetite. My energy and anxiety levels were high, but I felt very proud of myself. I only ever craved to smoke when watching a movie or playing video games. Playing Resident Evil 8 sober was incomprehensible to me, but I still had a blast.

Once my appetite and sleep started to regulate, both my mood and energy levels dropped significantly. I didn't really worry too much, especially after being on this subreddit non-stop. My appetite is actually stronger now than it was while smoking.

After 90 days, my mood and emotions started to raise and I felt like I could pivot myself out of a negative rut much easier. My energy levels, however, are still very low. I nap more now than I did when smoking. I'm hoping this changes soon, because it's such a waste of time. I'm dealing with anxiety much better now too, but it's still a work in progress.

Overall, I'm extremely happy that I've decided to make this change in my life. I have so much more time in the day to do what I want. I dream every night compared to dreaming maybe once or twice a year. I have so much more money. I can focus on dating and relationships rather just getting high and saying ""fuck it"". My friendships are becoming stronger. Even though the majority of my friends are still daily smokers, my time spent with them is more meaningful because it doesn't revolve around pot. I've become the friend who convinces them to do other things besides just seshing in a bedroom and watching YouTube.

Again, my only concern right now is my low energy and anxiety. After a decade of daily smoking, I know it's gonna take a while for my brain to re-wire itself. Luckily, I'm in this for the long haul.

I seriously can't thank you all enough for all the support you've provided over these last 138 days. I wanted to wait a whole year before I take an edible to visit Galaxy's Edge in Orlando, but honestly, life is so great sober, I won't even indulge.

If you are still on the fence about quitting, please, make the plunge. You're gonna be surprised at how more fulfilling life is.",26,0

I didn’t even try in school for the past six years, I only recently got diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar. And I am trying to get my mental health in a better place. And then I realized I’d have to give up weed. In the beginning it gave me nothing but pleasure, and I wanted to smoke all day and that’s it. Well not anymore, I am a grown adult and I can take care of myself. And I am doing this for myself. To anyone reading my story, you’ve got this. I believe in you, let’s get sober together.",128,0

I originally started smoking more to help myself stop drinking alcohol. Well, here I am, 283 days alcohol-free, and just stuck in another addiction. I've been thinking about trying to quit for months now. I made it 4 days a couple of months ago, and actually really enjoyed feeling sober. But I told myself I could smoke in moderation, and got myself back into the deep end. 

This morning I went out to smoke even though I really didn't feel like it, it has just become such a habit. Because I threw out all my glass a couple of weeks ago in an attempt to quit, I've been buying pre-rolls at the dispensary. I sat down and opened up a brand new pack of pre-rolls to find it completely empty. My immediate reaction was of course annoyance, and then panic, because this means I don't actually have any weed at all, when I thought I had 7 pre-rolls waiting for me. But instead of marching straight to the dispensary, a small voice in my head said ""maybe this is it."" 

So, I took the opportunity that was in front of me, and made the decision to quit. Like really, actually quit this time. I'm so sick of living my life in a haze, and I'm really sick of spending all my money on getting high. 

So today is day 1, again. I'm scared, nervous, and excited. But glad to have the community to come to. I don't think I could do this alone. No one else understands because no one thinks you can actually get addicted to weed, but I am and I don't want to be anymore.",7,0

Week 1- anxiety through the roof, dissociation as fuck, major depression and felt like I was going insane. Debated ending my life it was so bad. 

Week 2 - same as week 1, only worse. 

Week 3 - slightly better, still majorly dissociated and full of anxiety. Loads of intrusive thoughts. 

Week 4 - still better, although still the same symptoms. 

Week 5 - hey I’m starting to feel alright, I had genuinely good days most of the time. Some intrusive thoughts, hardly any anxiety. Went hiking ALOT.

I'm also much more present in the moment with my family and friends. My appetite has mostly returned. From the outside, it appears like I'm completely happy and doing well.

But inside I just feel... depressed. Like even during activities that I usually really enjoy, I just get this sinking feeling, and only occasionally get a small glimmer of happiness from it, which then quickly fades away. When I think about my plans for the future, I don't feel excited about them, and my mind starts to drift towards thinking about how they will all go wrong and not work out.

It's been really helpful to read the accounts of other people on r/leaves. But it's also tough because I don't know how I will be able to last through 4-8 months of these feelings based on what others have reported. I'm fine in this instant, and know I won't smoke today. But if something bad actually happens in my life (as it does sometimes), and I feel truly awful, it will be very difficult to resist the urge to walk the 3 minutes to the dispensary and pick up a single joint. If that moment comes, I'll rationalize it by telling myself that it's a 1 time thing, and it's no big deal. That all I want is a momentary relief from the extreme discomfort, and there's no harm in that. Then I'll feel fantastic the next day because my dumb addict brain has its THC back, and the rationalization cycle will start again. 

To me this period is the hardest part of quitting, and the reason why I've never made it past 2-3 weeks of sobriety from weed.

I'm sober now for well over a year after a 2+ decade history of daily smoking. I didn't get sober until I reached 40. Thats a lot of weed and a deeply ingrained habit to break. 

There are so many similarities between my story and yours, and between all the various stories I read on here. We're all human and weed has a familiar effect on those who lose their way with it. 

In the past I experienced many points of hopelessness. Times where I thought I'd never be able to stop and just resigned to the fact that I'd have to live that way. Many attempts were made to stop and those all failed. 

Last June, and leading up to last June I changed the way I thought about my life and about weed being part of it. Thanks to all my previous experiences and efforts to stop I had a full toolbox of skills to help me along the way. 

It took me 20-some years to stop - that was the course of my life. Its just how my journey went. No regrets, I'm focused on my future and I've got a lot (and can create a lot more) to live for.

If you are here trying and you keep trying you will eventually succeed. It's only those who don't try that have no hope - that is fine, people can live how they choose but if you're here and posting and actively trying then you want to change. It may take some time, it will take some effort and figuring things out on your own but if you never stop trying you will eventually achieve your goal.",89,0

First off I'd like to thank everyone in this community for making this sub reddit what it is today. Thank you for reading and thank you for commenting. Thank you for being part of my new life and my recovery. I honestly believe I would've had a harder time without you folks here..

I'm gonna keep this simple for those still struggling... I've been struggling with my smoking for the last 8 years... They've been a blurr.. I can't remember details, only bits and pieces... The longest I've gone without weed was 2 days, then I would get pissed off at the world, couldn't eat or rest properly...

The first 5 days were hard for me.. That with withdrawal, for me (everyone is different), I was nauseous in the morning, had no motivation to eat, higher anxiety (not crippling but still very uncomfortable} and vivid dreams, sometimes nightmares or dreams where I'd be smoking.... But like many have said before, this too shall pass, and it did..

The coming days got easier.. My brain started forming coherent thoughts again and I could taste a semblance of what many call ""normality"". I stuck to a routine that would allow me to get physical exercise and a healthy eating habit (3 square meals a day)... I read literature on recovery and addiction daily in the mornings to break the ""wake and bake"" part of my problem...

This will be a lifelong journey for me.. Not because I still crave the flower, but because I have an addictive personality and I have to remain vigilant... I can honestly say that I do not have the desire to smoke anymore.. When thoughts of smoking do arise, I attribute that to my addiction wanting to take hold of my life again and, to me, that's a desperate attempt from my addiction trying to remain alive...

I've come to understand my weed addiction as a little monster inside of me... Whenever life gets rough, that little monster will pipe up and say things like ""one little pinner won't hurt"",but knowing myself, once I start smoking, I can't stop. Understanding that every craving is my monster getting smaller and smaller was crucial for my getting through the first month.. My addiction was subsiding.. I was feeling whole again..

Things started to improve almost immidiately. My relationships improved (I don't hang out with smokers anymore, some people can but I've had to realize the only stuck around because I kept the party going). Focusing on tasks got easier and easier and chores and responsibilities actually became enjoyable... Not to say that I have rough days... I do, I can't help it... Now instead of reaching for a joint, I try to think objectively and control my emotional reactions to each situation... I can feel again.

The most important thing that helped me through was that if I didn't have that first hit, I wouldn't be high for the rest of the day.. So I focused on not smoking just for one day at a time.. Minutes turn into hours, then days, then weeks, then, before you know it, one month. But i can only control what happens today... Yesterday is gone, tomorrow isn't here yet... So I just focus on one day at a time (cliche, but it works for me).

So that's it for me folks, I'm open to all sorts of questions and I will do my very best to answer with as much details as possible... Hope this helps at least one of you...

Thank you all for being a part of my new life, have a safe and sober 24 hours. Peace.",12,0

I managed to stay 3 and a half days sober and I'm noticing a slight improvement of my short term memory.

My self-worth is close to zero and I feel like nothing makes sense anymore. I feel a lot of shame and regret as well.

I definitely will go on. I don't want to fall back into this toxic false friend called weed. I want to be free from my addiction.

The last month has mainly been just feeling shitty for myself and thinking about all the good changes I want to make and missing what I had in those three months, how big of a difference in positivity that brought me.

I am tired of the hands from using the devils lettuce constantly having a grip around my neck and slowly squeezing the life out of me, when all I am doing is saying ""please, stop.""

Today marks another new chapter, I rather again go through feeling as bad as I do already while using, and actually turn out for the better, then remain feeling as if all I can do is look in a constant negative light at myself.

I used to get high before, during, and after work in order to make the day more bearable. However, I'm starting to think that the weed is actually adding to my anxiety more than it's helping. I discovered this subreddit and I see myself in a lot of these posts, so I've been trying to quit. I can cut out the morning and day-time smoking no problem, but as soon as I'm off the clock, I sink back into a comfortable numbness.   


My rationalization begins in the car ride home. While sitting in traffic, I convince myself that my problems aren't related to the weed per se and therefore I should focus on fixing other aspects of my life before quitting weed. Or, I'll be so worked up from work that I think that I need a few hits and a beer to calm down and avoid a full-blown panic attack.   


I've started waking up at 5am and immediately having a panic attack. Things need to change. But is quitting weed important? How do other people with mental illnesses handle life without weed?

3. The most potent ‘hack’ for me has been simply not having any in the house. I grabbed all my weed, including a half oz of my favorite strain, a vape pen, and some edibles. Timed it right and dropped it in my wheelie bin *right before* the trash guys arrived. I watched it all happen in slow motion. All of it gone. I felt like the trash guys should’ve bowed their heads for a moment. lol. Roll credits. 

4. Me and the wifey have had some pretty uncharacteristically intense disagreements. I read someone say in this sub that it doesn’t go without a fight. For me it manifests in different ways at different times; sometimes like a demon exposed to the light, resulting in mood swings, terrible
Insomnia, and depression. It’s a parasite and it hates you when you quit. 

5. Weed lies to you. It tells you that you could quit anytime if you wanted to. It tells you that it’s your ally. A healthy way to relieve stress. It tells you that you can find the existential answers you’re looking for more easily when you’re high. It tells you you’re gonna be the glorious exception to the rule and you won’t end up like the typical stoner because you’re special and smart.

6. A few recent positives. My physical vision has been somehow clearer in the last few days. My sense of smell has come back. I didn’t realize it was gone. Colors are more vibrant already. I have been putting my daughter to bed and not rushing it. Listening to her. Reading to her. We’ve been closer. Weed makes you so selfish. 

That’s all for now. Just a few reflections for whoever wants to read them. Waving to you from across the way and cheering everyone on! Thankful to be on the path with some good folks.",189,0

I started school and work full time and could use all the energy I can get, I have a major surgery coming up in January and I started to break the rules I set for myself regarding weed. I was able to not drink during the week but I wasn't able to not smoke until all my assignments were completed so I figured I could use some time off until I have the control again. I'm about 2 hours away from 3 sober days!! So far I'm okay because I have a very busy schedule but Im still struggling in 2 areas. Sleep and appetite. 
Like I said I have a busy schedule so from 6am-10pm I'm constantly engaged or doing something. Which is why I find it strange that although I know I'm tired from running around all day I can't get my mind to be quiet and stop thinking. I tried listening to meditation videos and white noise. They work okay while I'm doing it but once I turn off my phone to go to sleep the thoughts start funneling in again. I need every minute of sleep I can get so any tips would be appreciated.
With the food area I've always struggled with eating. I'm just not a fan of food I think planning meals, cooking and cleaning take up way too much time that I don't have so basically I eat for survival. Since I stopped smoking I can only eat like 2 small meals for the whole day. And by small I mean a sandwich and a yogurt or half of the servings I used to eat. I'm hungry tho. I Kno this because my stomach growls, my mind isnt focused and I haven't eaten in hours but when I go to put food in my mouth I just get nauseous and I can't get it down. 😣",3,0

So i am starting day 8 (actually i will go to bed after this, so day 8 morning will be tomorrow). And craving isn't there. It's so easy it's suspicious....

Somewhat i know that eventually the chance to smoke weed will be presented to me and i guess i will.feel intense craving.
By a friend, by myself alone, by issues in life that will make me start a coping mechanism that for the past 10 years has been weed.

I wanna be prepared, when the time comes. I wanna write a list and keep it in my phone so when a friend might say ""if you want...it is just one spliff"" or if my mind will say ""c'mon don't you wanna celebrate this? It is just a funny joint"" etc i will have a counter action that will make myself reasonate against craving and against the ""well...just one....why not"".
Right now it is easy but i am afraid about the long period. Maybe after 1 month i will feel craving and i will tell myself ""why not"". I have to find out why not.

Every time I've tried to quit I end up twitching and screaming myself awake almost every night.,"So yeah, day 2. I've been tapering off for a few weeks, going from bong and oil and rosin daily to just oil and rosin, then just a small bit of rosin before bed. I don't really know why I'm posting here... Just being able to talk to people who are going what I'm going through, I think? 

I know sleep issues are common when quitting. In the past five years, I've smoked pretty much all day, literally every day barring the attempts to stop. My longest was 13 days. 

My biggest issue is the screaming. Every night, or almost every night, I wake up literally shrieking. Like horror movie shrieking. It'll happen once or twice a sleep cycle but I'll jerk awake many more times. Oddly enough, I don't dream now. Smoking made my dreams super vivid and interconnected. When I dreamed, I always went to the same city and lived a life there. I know how weird that sounds, but the (unrelated, probs) mild delusion has been persisting that I'm dying in that other world now. 

I'll mention that I'm currently undergoing a battery of mental health tests - I have had many diagnoses over the years and need a comprehensive care plan - so I'll try to mention this at my next appointment, as well. It's my biggest motivation for quitting. I know initially it helped with my anxiety and depression and PTSD but after years of heavy smoking I know it's just dragged me down. 

I'm really scared to quit. To see who I am now and face that. Last time, after just under two weeks, my partner and I relapsed. We were anxious, sweating, snappy messes. I know we have to push through that (he's quitting as well) and it's great that we motivate eachother but going through the withdrawals together fucking suuuuucks. 

Anyways, yeah, that's my story for right now. I have a lot of physical health issues I know smoking helped alleviate so I'm also really scared to see how my body is going to feel over the next while. I know it's going to be for the best, and I think maybe writing all this out helped.",3,0

I started when i turned 16 years. i was pretty reckless at that age and i guess i kinda fell in love with smoking weed. soon came other drugs.  friendgroup started to change. I was in pain. there were a few reasons for it. In my head i was yelling ""FU*K EVERYTHING!"". 

at 17 i often skipped school  to smoke and eventually dropped out. classic story. Oh, and i was also diagnosed with ADD when i was 15.
i started to give up my responsibilities more and more. I remember feeling like an absolute failure. (i was prone to depression before, but now i almost hated myself)

im now 20 and i no longer use anything else but weed and drink some beer. But i really need to stop smoking weed. that has been almost my everyday fix since turning 16. now for about two or three years ive just been ""chilling"", doing nothing productive, just hanging out with stoner friends and living at my moms house. Well i do workout, quite intensively actually, but my weed smoking habit takes a toll on that too. And i did get over my social anxiety that i had been dealing with for a while. actually got pretty good at talking to girls again, too. i dont watch porn that much anymore. lately ive been more open and loving with my relatives. So yeah there has been some notable self-development. But the hard one is the one im writing about, quitting weed.

I have a lovely girlfriend now who doesnt smoke and i have started to care about the course of my life. i want to be productive like i used to be. i want to have better relationships with my GF and relatives. i want to feel more alive.. smoking has made me more hedonistic, more numb, more anxious, and more depressed. sometimes i have been without weed for a week or so and ive felt so different, so much calmer and better.

But too easily i say to myself that its okay to smoke some weed and just chill, although deep inside i know it has been hurting me and my loved ones alot. 

i do understand that everything doesnt get fixed by quitting weed.

i know theres a reason why i got addicted in the first place. but i cant get to the reason without quitting weed first.. weed makes me live in my own head, not turning interesting thoughts in to action.

Today i said to my girlfriend im quitting. I hope i wont let her down. it was this years spring when i decided that after the summer, i will quit for good. i know i will find answers, and my life will get much better if i go through this.. i can feel it. if its not this time that im gonna go through this then i dont know when.

Yesterday I found about 2 extra hours in my day that normally would have been time spent smoking and doing literally nothing

The night time came and I could not fall asleep and had some cold sweats in the middle of the night, am I already feeling the withdrawals?

I’m not really hungry but it’s mostly the lack of cravings, I just don’t even know what to eat, it’s all bland and just not appetizing. Ended up eating some home cooked pasta with chicken and it was meh, before quitting I would eat about 3k calories (I’m about 235lbs now but used to be 190 before weed) this might help me get back to that weight. Should I embrace this and add a fasting diet to this new sober me?

Otherwise I am ok not smoking and while I want to do it my reasons for stopping are currently helping me cope and stay the course.

The rest of the week I am finally going to start the certification online courses I’ve been putting off for about a year now, this is going to help take up time and hopefully help me start my consulting business

When your life evolves around weed it's easy to put yourself in a box and feel sorry for yourself whilst navigating through the withdrawals, but it's so comforting to read that there are so many of you out there going through the same thing and that none of us are alone (especially when 90% of your closest friends smoke daily lol).

I just wanted to share my piece of the no-weed journey as I feel it will help me solidify my plan to become weed-free and hopefully can inspire some others along the way / relate to at least one of you out there.

So I am from the UK, and like a lot of countries it's very common to smoke with tobacco. Growing up I never touched cigarettes but when I began to get into smoking weed (5/6 years ago now... wow that's horrible to say since I spent the majority of those years smoking daily lol), it was the norm to use tobacco as everyone around me at the time would refuse to roll a joint if it had no tobacco - this is what ultimately led me to getting PHYSICALLY addicted to weed.

Flash forward a number of years to early 2021, where I decided to get rid of the tobacco and switch to a replacement tobacco mix known as damiana (think there are several other alternatives idk), which absolutely changed the game; once I got through the couple of weeks of feeling like I just wasn't getting high.

Eventually, once my mind had learned to get high properly without tobacco in my joints, I stopped putting in damiana and just went with pure weed as I was sick of the taste - we all know you then feel like you need to compensate as you joints come out small... which guess what? Yep, you guessed it, leads to you putting in larger amounts of weed than you previously would with tobacco, thus upping your tolerance and becoming more dependant and MENTALLY addicted to weed.

Flash forward to today and I am nearly 3 full days clean from weed and if anyone says it's easy they are lying lol. I wake up 5-6 times in the middle of the night as I am so drenched from sweat, I can barely eat throughout the day  and if I do, I have to catch my appetite in the small 5-minute window my body opens up for me, intense cravings (especially when someone in the street is nearby smoking a joint, again, very common in the UK haha) and just general emotional swings throughout the day. It's also so much harder working from home as I have nothing to split up my day with.

I have quit in the past (longest I lasted was like 2-3 months) and I can thankfully say it isn't as bad as when I quit whilst using tobacco in my joints, however, fuck me the days can be tricky at points, which I'm sure most people reading this can relate to!

Sorry for the novel but I just wanted to say my part of my journey and of course welcome any comments / advice to get through the rest of these days. 

It's good to know you're not alone and I would be keen to hear more people's stories and how their progression is going so please feel free to drop in your tske on your journey and I will gladly take the time to read through :)

• Eating healthy, balanced meals 
• Going to the gym and exercising daily 
• Meditation (I recommend the Headspace app) 
• Following a rigorous hygiene routine, day and night 
• I joined a local Jiu Jitsu gym 
• Throwing myself into a passion (writing/performing music) 
• Being more attentive and spending more time with my girlfriend, kids and family 
• Cutting down on cell phone (“electronics”) use 
• Reading and learning more

Or general weirdness around time - often in contradictory ways.

For example:

1. I'll be sitting at home after work around 5pm, I'll light up to ""enjoy"" the evening, and then keep checking the clock every 15 minutes or so. I have this fear that if I don't check the clock, then all of a sudden it will be 11pm and I need to go to sleep. The passing of time has become a constant source of anxiety in my life. 

2. I'll be trying to think about what I need to do in the next day/week and it will feel incredibly overwhelming and like there's not nearly enough hours in the day to take care of everything. 

3. The last 6 years have been a blur in a lot of ways. I can't believe how quickly it's gone. It also really stresses me out because if the last 6 went by this fast, then the next 6 can only go by faster, right? 

I know not all of this is attributable to weed, but I do wonder if some of this resonates with other people here. Did quitting help?

296,2021-08-25 10:43:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pbcoke/strange_but_illuminating_relapse/,Strange but illuminating relapse,"Hi all,

I was a daily smoker for 12 years, on and off (mostly on). Since being treated for ADHD it’s been a lot easier to abstain, or at least recognize when I should abstain, which is great overall. The last few years I would smoke for a few months, then quit for a few months. Withdrawal worse each time. 

To be honest, it’s been a hard year. Between a 4th Covid wave sending us back into near-lockdown, some hard times personally and family illness, I sort of stopped caring as much about sobriety. Light cravings became longing, slowly but surely. 

My wife and I figured we’d just do it on the weekends, something I was interested in trying. I figured I’d been sober enough the last few years that I don’t fear those weekdays without. But as I should have expected, it was not to be. It backfired.

I got a nasty sinus cold, and began smoking during the week. I had no plans on using this as a reason to smoke during the week. The logic went something like “well, I’m not doing anything anyway, so might as well be high and reduce cold symptoms (which for me, is a thing). However, after just 3 weeks of very on and off blazing, something happened. 

It was like my body went straight back into full addict mode. After 5 days of blazing, I tried to sleep normally on Monday. I couldn’t find sleep to save my life. My appetite was shot. I genuinely felt like I was withdrawal. That night, with plenty of time on my hands to think, I realized that my body was simply saying no. I smoked to get some sleep and resolved to quit within a couple of days.

It felt like a warning system. Like an annoying reminder from my soul that I’m not supposed to be doing this, because it doesn’t serve me anymore. That, and I value my sleep far too much. Dependence is personal slavery and I’m not down with it.

This is the shortest period of time I’ve stopped smoking after starting again, and that’s something to be proud of. 

Maybe just maybe, I’m ready to stop fooling myself. I suppose an unpleasant and unexpected withdrawal will do that to you.",13,2

Tried to quit many times but kept telling myself, ""This is the last one, I'll quit tomorrow"". And it's been a year since. I am clinically depressed with anxiety issues. I was a nicotine addict and I left that habit only to substitute it with weed.

And quarantine has been a catalyst driving my cravings. I used to smoke 3/4 joints in a single day. It had become sort of a ritual - I couldn't function in my day-to-day life without taking a puff. The worst thing is - I was productive even when I was high as a kite. I am the top performer at my work place. Smoking helped cause it's remote work environment. The downside was I was tired the whole day if I smoked up, didn't have any interest to talk to anyone / even listen to anyone. Terrible anxiety attacks throughout the day and crying spells that crippled me. My PMS became worse with crippling anxiety and nervous breakdowns. The saddest thing is, no one in my family or in my friends group realize how isolated weed was making me. It's like it pulled me away from everything good. 

Following a couple of mental breakdowns in the last three months, the dependency increased a lot. I started drifting away from everything and everyone - it was very subtle but it didn't dawn on me sooner. I used to love trying out new things, to draw/sketch, write poems, and even resolve my trauma through writing. Somewhere along the way, I just stopped doing all that. It feels like I've been living in a cave since a year and more. I haven't processed anything good/bad that has happened in the recent past. It feels like a blur and weed is the primary culprit.

Hit Day 3 today and it feels like I'm sinking - I try to occupy myself with distractions but my mind feels like it's in someone else's control. At times when these cravings are really bad - my brain stops functioning entirely and remains on loop to convince me to just smoke up. I'm determined to quit but there's a tiny part of my brain that is convinced that only weed can help me feel better. I don't want to go back to the same pattern where I'm just being consumed by this one thing - weed controls me so much that I've lost control over everything. It's like I'm a slave to even the thought of it. I feel guilty that this thought keeps coming up and I have to fight so hard every single waking moment. It's been really difficult not to give in.

Background: I had inadvertently developed a slight dependency on other drugs after a surgery. I smoked every day for about three years to avoid facing my own depression and anxiety or even recognizing them for what they were. I am still struggling with those things but I am doing it without trees.

Some things that have helped me:

Taking it slow and developing a new routine. 
The first month feels like it sucks. And then the second month sucks a little less. And the third even less. Life’s never going to be perfect, but it can still get better/enjoyable without trees.

Throw your shit away. All of it. If it was expensive maybe give it to someone who can use it but do not keep it around because it will give you a reservation to use. If it helps, get rid of all the trees first. Then one piece of gear each day. Or just put it all in a triple wrapped garbage bag, smash it up and toss it in a dumpster. Get it out of your reach.

A weighted blanket.

Switching to decaf coffee.

Hydrating.

Meditation. Seriously, get an app or something to help you and even if you don’t feel like you’re “doing it right” keep going. 5 minutes a day even.

White noise to help with sleep.

Exercise, going for a walk is enough. 

Setting aside money you would have spent on trees in a savings account.

Lighthearted podcasts.

Looking for a better job once you’re clean enough to test.

Learning to be kind to yourself (still working in that one).

That’s just the tip of the iceberg and it hasn’t always been easy, and some of my ability to not use comes from my own anxieties around repercussions that may be magnified in my own mind but…I’m clean.",13,0

This is important for me as while being a psychonaut (just a fancy term i used to describe me getting high all the time and defenitely not being a psychonaut) during these 10 years i learnt about lucid dreaming.

I had few lucid dreams during these years and i have always found an incredible world where i can create and Explore,a hyperreality with its ""laws"" that i can enjoy and in which i know i can find illumination, as well as in wake life as it surely affect my mood and experience.of this real world.

And guess what? Smoking pot and lucid dreaming can't cohexist. They just cannot!
And i always knew this but thought i was ""different"" and i could.try to keep both. Big mistake as i couldn't even recall any dream so how could i lucid dream.

But now, after 10.long years, this has changed and here is my chance to have an amazing waking life as well as an astonishing dreaming life. 

I am so glad i decided this!

Over the past few months I've began getting anxiety every time I smoked and I didn't enjoy smoking weed anymore, but I continued because it was a habit. Last week I took an edible and I had such extreme anxiety that I contemplated all my life decisions and because I realized that I had college coming up. Ultimately threw everything out and quit for good. I don't want to smoke ever again and now sober, I am realizing how negatively weed has impacted me.

However, after quitting weed I've began to have some pretty bad anxiety. I've been waking up after getting like 6 hours of sleep I wake up restless with racing thoughts, and I can't fall fully back to sleep.  It gets much better during the day but it sometimes comes in waves. Sometimes I feel crappy at the end of the day but I feel like it's because of the lack of sleep. I mostly worry about going to college. I've been making healthy thought habits like reminding myself that my thoughts are real etc. and it's been getting better as the days pass.

I'm wondering if this is normal as withdrawal, or did I fuck up and give myself an anxiety disorder somehow?

At first, weed was a magical panacea for me. It helped me recover from my eating disorder, I became much more spiritual, creative, healthy and confident. I loved being a stoner, loved finding out other people were stoners, and thought weed could do no wrong. 

I’m so grateful for what weed has done for me. And I truly do think that, in moderation, it has wonderful healing powers. However, I think it is time for me to quit. It pains me to say, because I have so many happy memories associated w weed, and it’s been a part of my personality for so long, so listing out the reasons why I need to quit would be helpful 

1)after a traumatic situation 2 years ago where a man gave me a synthetic wax pen, I can’t help but be slightly triggered by weed now. Even tho I still smoke, it definitely makes me think about that scary situation 

2) loss of productivity. I can’t be stoned and home alone, it’s too scary for me. So I just get high and watch tv, waiting for someone to come home 

3) save $$$

4) made me inactive. Let my physical health go, gained weight, eat unhealthy munchies 

5) makes me hypersensitive / paranoid and afraid to be out in public alone

**most of these side affects happened after I developed PTSD. I’m not healing as much as I would like, so I think it’s time to cut out the weed.

I really am going to miss smoking, but I think it is time to move on

Been browsing this sub for a while and have gotten a lot of great insight and motivation from various posts.

I’m 24 days without tree (I know it’s not much but I’m proud) and starting to feel normal again. To all who are just starting I encourage you to stick with it at least for a couple weeks to see how you feel. It is an amazing feeling to actually get a good nights sleep and wake up without brain fog. I think my dependency on weed caused me to feel shame/embarrassment deep down and wouldn’t allow me to blossom into my true self. I still have bad days and cravings sometimes but I wouldn’t trade how I feel now to smoking everyday again. It is also important to accept the past and realize that isn’t who you are or who you have to be anymore. I still have fond memories of my smoking days but truly feel they are behind me and I can look forward to a new future.

Going through a mixture of highs and lows. Some days I think I’m past all the depression and anxiety and panic attacks and other days (like today) I start getting so dark and the thoughts of suicidal creep in.

Weed made me so numb and warm with this false sense of reality, I started ignoring all the shit and trauma in my life. And now it’s like I’ve got weed withdrawals AND I have to face my demons head on.

I’ve started therapy, admitted to myself I have a problem with self esteem, teen sexual abuse, and a rushed marriage. I’m scared, I don’t want to throw my relationship away. But I’m 25 and part of me wonders if I would have gotten myself into this if I wasn’t stoned all the time.

I’ve been such an emotional wreck. My husband said he doesn’t mind if I continue smoking, but I want to learn to deal with my problems and not cover them up. I’m giving myself 30 days and will reevaluate my feelings then. Right now I’m completely emotionally unavailable but I’m giving myself the benefit of the doubt that maybe it’s a depletion of serotonin. I haven’t been able to eat, sleep, work, anything without getting these intense panic attacks.

One thing I am doing is practicing mindfulness and trying to start believing in a higher power. Something to pull me through when I feel so dark and isolated.

I can't do that stoned, I have no outward personality if I'm high, I lived in my head. But I miss enjoying doing those things and wonder if they'll become enjoyable again in the same way; getting lost in them, unaware of time, not feeling bored or uncreative... or am I just fooling myself and the weed just made time seem to pass unnoticed.

I've had depression ever since they were about 6 months old (was armchair diagnosed by an offduty doctor at a party who told me I *had* to go see my own doctor because my conversation was that abnormal). I've been smoking regularly since then. 

I hate myself. I'm an underachieving unmotivated unfit bucket of cells, and I'm fairly sure I'm going off the deep end right now. My husband is fine and has time to take care of himself(regular gym, healthy lifestyle) and work a demanding job. and I seem to blame raising kids ( I don't have them during the days except during the holidays), or having to cook meals, on not getting stuff done, like i can manage 1 or 2 times a week at the gym, once a week walk with a friend. I want to go to the gym more but end up cancelling because I've got other shit to do that I forgot about. But my job isn't even 9-5 so how the fuck do I not have time to schedule keep fit?

Now I've stopped smoking, and dropped the dope, I thought I would feel better. I don't. I mean, I don't have the guilt constantly and I definitely am happy to miss the sneaking outside whilst my husband rolls his eyes, but I'm now just DEPRESSED. I  notice that because I'm larger than I want to be, I can't buy clothes. I do have trainers at home already and am a member of the same gym, I just haven't haven't around to that yet. I just want to stop existing (I'm sure the kids don't really actually need me, because when I'm not around my husband does parent absolutely perfectly).

I've started a new hobby (foraging; definitely mostly on the research side still) which is great fun when I can get to it. I've stopped being involved in a charity I was involved in but am taking steps to get into one that is a better fit for me. I don't have many friends (although would walk through fire for the few that I have). I hate shopping. I should probably do some training for my job but motivation is hard to find (plus, I find that I think I need to do every single course that I look at which gets daunting and impractical).

So. I'm sure I would be feeling much worse (well, the same but with more guilt) if I hadn't stopped. But stopping has just made me realise exactly how crap I really am and I don't like me at all.

I've read a few people's posts on here and I'm sure some of this is withdrawal, and I know I'm lucky in that I've had practically no side effects,  but I don't know where to go from here.

What should I do? Any suggestions? I can't believe I'm going to post this but, like I say, I've not got many friends who I can talk to about quitting and sorting my life out. I've been trying to set myself goals and basically my goal right now is not to scratch myself until I bleed. I need to be better than this.

Folks on this very sub counseled me against my most recent family visit, as it was some exhausting dynamics that facilitated (but did not CAUSE) my relapse in June, which lasted for about 7 weeks.

I kind of knew I was going to use, because I knew it was going to be hard for me. My dad's 83 and in failing health (although he still works, by choice), lots of baggage and history, PLUS some family secrets from my brother which I had not been aware of.

I'm not feeling terrible about this relapse, although I know I need to steel and prepare myself for future drama as it will certainly come when my dad dies.

I've been wanting to quit for a while and I'm glad I've taken the first step towards leaving it behind but it almost feels like idk what else to do. Its dawned on me that I smoke to have something ""to do"" but I do absolutely nothing when I do smoke. 

I've had friends tell me that you cant be addicted to weed but idk what else to call it. I've been told that a little every now and then isn't bad but a gram will last me a week or more even smoking daily, even that small amount stops me from accomplishing anything around the house or pursuing things that I want to do. If it's around I'm going to smoke it So there really no ""only little"" or smoking in ""moderation"" for me.

But now that I'm a day sober i have no idea what those things i was putting off are and feel lost. Maybe part of that is because I slept horrible last night and I'm just in a funk. I'm looking forward to this journey but it seems daunting. 

Thanks for letting me get some stuff off my chest and sorry for kinda being all over the place.",3,0

But I have found recently that after smoking daily for 2+ years, it’s no longer the same experience it once was. I used to feel out of the world, creative, enjoyed movies and music more, etc. But recently, firstly, I barely even get high anymore. I have to stack bowls on bowls to feel “high” but mostly now it just makes me feel normal. I desperately want to quit because I find that I have absolutely NO energy anymore. Mind you, I’m a healthcare worker who frequently works 16 hour shifts, or overnights, but even when I do sleep I immediately hit a bowl when I wake up and I’m ready for bed again. I have no motivation to better my life. My house gets so messy and I’m too high to give a fuck sometimes, and that is so embarrassing to me. It makes me feel so worthless and depressed. Like I’m such a failure I can’t even keep a home nice bc i am addicting to weed? I don’t work out or move, I don’t do the things I used to love anymore. I feel like I am a shell of a person who “NEEDS” to smoke now. It’s gone from a really fun recreational and relaxing activity to my main coping mechanism. I also smoke with my boyfriend. He’s been a heavy smoker for about 10 years. He has also been ready to quit but I have continued to convince him to continue buying because I am so afraid of the detox. I’ve gone through it a little bit in the past, night terrors, night sweats, absolutely no appetite, and CRAZY ANXIETY. We just finished all that we had yesterday. I am already feening but I’m desperate to move past this and just finally QUIT. What worked for y’all? Herbs? Teas? Creative ideas? I am so thankful for this subreddit as I’ve felt really really alone with all of this lately. I also find it hard to talk to my bf about this bc I feel like I have been holding him back selfishly.

Hello, I’ve always wanted to be a part of this page and now I feel like I finally can. I stopped smoking for two weeks and have been using edibles to ween myself. I can’t tell if it’s helping or hurting. Either way I’m experiencing all the pain that I suppressed before I started smoking, and now I’m having to work through these feelings that are boueying up. Why does it feel like I’m going through a legitimate withdrawal? I’ve been told weed doesn’t do that to you. Cannabis has soothed my flashbacks, relieved physical pain and taken me away from myself when I don’t want to be with myself. Now I’m here— with myself, and I feel like I don’t know her anymore. I’m thrusted back to 19 years old, the woman who discovered that she was sexually abused as a child by family members. I don’t know how to live with myself without weed— the tool that has helped me cope. I have other coping skills— but seriously contemplating the value of cannabis in my life for all of its healing that it has served me. I stopped smoking because I got sick and it’s exacerbated my asthma. Now I feel separated from my friends and I’ve come back to myself— and sitting in solitude with my sober self is the hardest most painful thing I’ve done in years and years. Coming from a family full of addicts this is so new and so uncomfortable for me; it feels pure and right but I don’t know how im gonna make it another two weeks. I smoked for about 4.5 years daily. It’s so linked to my trauma. Im so ready to let it go but the pain is unbearable. I would appreciate any support/hands to hold.

I have been a very heavy smoker (4 to 8/10 joints per day). 
Recently, also because of my buddhist pathway, i decided to stop this attachment.

This is day 6. 

What happened during these last days is that i sleep very very bad (but got dream recall back yuhuu).
Also if one day i feel very relaxed and full of energy and mental clarity, the next day (like today) i have a sort of general physical weakness and mental fog that won't let me function good. 

Like, today due to this weakness and feeling of fainting i decided not to take my car and do my work hours (thank god i'm in private practice so it's not like i have to go to work 8 hours day and the boss will tell.me something).

I am also ending up, while working, my university study and i feel kind of anxious about my last exam and i guess a part of what i am feeling is like that.

My most fear is that i will feel like this.all.the time/for a long time.
Like this means : having these crisis of weakness/fatigue/sense of vaint - mental fog during this physical ""attacks"".

I do not crave (even if it is kind of strange afte 8-10 years of heavt daily use) the substance even if i am actually plenty of it right now.

I guess i am writing to find support and know about stories that ended up well.

I also not sure if these symptoms are about this quitting cold turkey (while i am.writing it's been 6 days since my last joint)

I surely would love to have some support and even som community live chat or some individuals to talk with.

During the days where i feel fine in this 6 days i feel very happy and at peace. When i have these crisis i feel.like shit and world just fall apart.

If you also have some link to possibile online chat help it might be really.great for me.

We came home and then went on another trip for a couple of weeks, which probably helped me in that I was distracted by new sights, scents, and sounds while adapting to my new reality. During our travels, sometimes I would catch a whiff of weed in the air or at the building where we were staying. I thought it would be more difficult smelling it in the air or on other people (shared one elevator with a fella who I would swear was a dealer—the elevator still smelled like weed after he left! lol) but every time I smelled it, I thought, it is so nice not to be chasing after that. I live in a legal state, and dispensaries are so much less of a trigger than I expected. Even going to the spots where I usually toked up in my house hasn’t made me want to relapse. I thought withdrawal would be tougher, but already I am appreciating remembering dreams and having a “lightness of being,” my consciousness and conscience unclouded by weed. Also, I think I was way moodier and prone to anger when I was getting high. It’s like my emotional self was some kind of bear that was always feeling poked and jarred by life circumstances, and now I am just responding to things as I feel them but am not all over the place in my reactions.

365,2021-08-24 11:28:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/papkxz/day_one/,Day One...,"Hello everyone,

Long time lurker here. I've been following this sub for a couple of months now as I realized long ago that I needed to change my ways and habits, most of which heavily involved smoking weed. 

I've read countless posts in this sub and started to relate my habits with others who share similar stories. While I always told myself that I'm just smoking casually, looking back - I now realize I've been a regular smoker for a couple of years. I thought if I create enough roadblocks, I won't be as addicted. Roadblocks such as not knowing how to roll, not keeping stuff at home, not smoking when alone and so on. However, they made me want to smoke it even more. I learned how to roll, got in touch with couple of dealers and started smoking it even when I was alone - well, mostly when I'm alone. 

I always told myself that I'll eventually quit it one day but that 'day' never came. Because of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, I stopped smoking for 2-3 consecutive months twice but soon after the lockdown was lifted, I rang up friends and asked them to ready some stuff for me to smoke. Even when I seemingly took a break from smoking because of unavailability, I always seemed to get back to old habits sooner or later.

This time however, I'm determined to quit it for good. I've been making positive changes in my life this past year and 'quitting weed' is the next positive change that I want to make. Even recently when smoking, I tend to regret it immediately after lighting one as I seem to go through a 'why am I still smoking, I should stop' phase. I'm going to listen to this feeing and quit it from today onwards. Its tough but not impossible. 

I hope to post in this sub after a year about how I've been sober for a year. Wish me luck everyone :)",5,3

And I as like to say “feeling good is good enough.”50 days smoke free (one little roach tho, more on that later) Smoked for 35 years - 25 of them pretty much daily. Managed to make it to the suburban dream with a beautiful wife and 3 healthy children. Great job. Stressful but lucrative. But I was a savvy and suave smoker behind it all. Those that knew me, knew I had a love for the bud. Everyone else, I hid it real well. My wife used to smoke with me pretty regularly pre-pandemic, but she was  not cool with the vibes as shit was getting real in the world and it made her anxious and paranoid. Lockdowns, school closures and shitty news made it easy to spin one up and smoke away. Hell, I was having it delivered to the door. But it was a giant Gerbil wheel. I would smoke to push away my anxiety/stress and then wake up to plan how I would smoke when my work was done for the day. Exhausted, I began to want to do myself in. I could envision horrible thoughts and they only came about when I was smoking. Fleeting, and they’ve been around forever like the bud so I made the decision 50 days ago to toss my stash, papers, and lighters. Everything except my wooden 25 year old grinder. My kids were not going to have that Dad who was in a haze, jonesing for a smoke as I was hurrying them to bed. I began smoking earlier in the evening and they were smelling the lingering smoke and that was not cool either. I also wanted to fix my head. 

Here is some stuff I’ve learned in the 50 days;

- my dreams are insane. I am still having some intense ones 49 nights later. Sometimes 3 or 4 a night. 

- sleep is better but still choppy. I figure it will take me 6 months to level out some. Have an insomnia and extra bedding plan in place. 

- I am much better with the kids and the d2d of the household with my wife. Less panicky BS when shit goes sideways. More chores completed. 

- work remains stressful as hell, and since I was blazed in the evenings and weekend’s it was remarkable that I was able to get that shit done. Well, since I quit smoking, I’ve become much more productive and focused on the tasks at hand. 

- I’ve had a slip up. I found a nice roach that literally fell to my feet as I closed the shed door (it was above the door frame in one of my many hiding spots) It was a warm night and I was past the 28 day mark so I figured let ‘er rip. It was okay at first, but within an hour I was back to my stoner self, forgetting shit, mind racing if I locked the gate/shed/doors - the stuff I did not miss. I slept horribly and the experience solidified my determination to not smoke. I chalk it up to progress. 

- weed will always be there. I just don’t need to be with it. I have reached out to my doctor and she prescribed an anti-anxiety drug which I was not down with but I was at the end of my rope. It’s helped me immensely. Not saying its for all, but this size fit me. I am also in therapy. This helps, as well has this board. 

For those reading this who are embarking or who are on this journey - it literally day by day is how to to approach it. But the days get better. Not easier, but better. Keep going, drink LOTS of water, exercise, indulge in some hobbies and keep cool. I figure I’ve smoked enough to be “cool” in my own mind.    Good luck and thanks for your support.",18,2

I started smoking weed on a daily basis in summer 2019. My habit became much worse when I lost my corporate job, then covid happened right after and we went into quarantine. I ended up being at home for months and smoking a lot all day everyday. 

I came to the realization in august 2020 that I need to stop. I successfully quit for two months, then retreated back to the habit in November 2020. I quit again in February 2021 then retreated back to the habit in April 2021. Every time I told myself I could do it in moderation which led to my demise. 

I am now 9 days clean again and this time really feels like the last time. I’ve went through a lot this past year and I just realized I really don’t have space in my life for weed anymore. I’ve tried so hard to restrict my use but it always ends up becoming a daily habit. I don’t know why I keep lying to myself. 

I am now committing to a cleaner and healthier lifestyle (I was also binge eating while I was smoking) and I already feel significantly better only after 9 days. 

I have a lot of anxiety about this new life I’m going to enter into. I feel like I don’t remember what life is like sober. That is what I’m most anxious about. I am much more fun though sober which is great (more engaging, funnier, and more connected to myself). I am also experiencing horrible withdrawal (anger, sadness, confusion, digestive issues). I’m just curious if anyone has advice to stay on track because these mood swings are killing me. I don’t want to retreat back to this habit. It has cost me so much money, and I lost myself in the process. 

I also was wondering if any long term quitters could share their stories and how their lives have changed since quitting. Those always motivate me to keep going.  

Thank you for reading and I wish you all the best. We can do this. I’m also looking for an accountability partner if anyone is interested.",4,2

Ever since I was 16, I've been smoking daily. It felt like something that cool kids do at the time, and I surely felt like a cool kid.  Grades drop down, social life is amazing, but overall motivation is just non-existant at that age, forming habits that I'd regret.

Years pass by, relationships change, your mentality changes and you start to think: something's wrong. I could be doing much more. I could be a better friend. I could be a better student. I used to think the world was just one big path that I needed to discover - why don't I feel like that anymore?

And then you realize that you've had a crutch. Every friend you made, was because of weed, and it was just a smoking buddy, not an actual friend. Your grades and work ethic start to pour down the drain, but you feel okay because you're quite happy and high all the time. Family relationships are damaged because they don't approve of your weed use, but you supposedly know that weed is a consequence-free drug (which it isn't), so you keep doing it. Things feel logically off, but an unconscious comfortable feeling takes place, and you ignore the sound argument that ends in ""I should stop smoking"".

Suddenly, you find yourself in a weak spot. Something that hurt, like a bad break-up, just feels like it won't go away, and you smoke more, and it still doesn't go away. After a little while, a general, day-to-day apathy finds you. But this isn't apathy; it's depression, being masked by perpetuous smoking. And you notice it if you're not high.

&#x200B;

Two days ago, I ran out of weed. It was only a day without it, but for the first time in years, I was able to think clearly. Unfortunately (or fortunately) on that same day, I found out that the whole group of ""close friends"" I had was constantly keeping me out of events they went and acting manipulatively. It hurts to know that people you trust decided to make you feel excluded. But in the other hand, they have been doing this for a while, and I couldn't see it because of a perpetual high.

375,2021-08-24 07:03:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pal3d7/im_a_420_baby/,I'm a 420 baby.,"When I told new smoking buddies that I am born on 420, they would say ""no way man, that's amazing"". Established stoner friends would often repeat to me that I was meant to be a stoner. Hell, I would even say that to myself as a form of justification to continue smoking. Admittedly, these affirmations help cement my weed use into a daily habit. 

While I was with my ex, she would often say to me that weed changed my personality. I stubbornly refused to believe her. I'd tell her that weed helped me to relax after a stressful work week, and it was my way to unwind at the end of the day. I embarrassingly recall days where I would eat a weed cookie, drive the exact time it would take for it to start hitting me, and meet my ex, or my friends. In hindsight, this was terribly dangerous.

I would often give weed away to my stoner friends. I loved being a little weed humanitarian. I had access to the best, most potent strains in my city. Better yet, I didn't even have to pay for it. It was like the Rastafarian Ganja Gods were blessing me for being a 420 baby.

I gave weed away to my friends, sold it to CEOs and smoked it with whoever I met that identified as a stoner. I felt on top of the weed mountain. I felt spiritually awakened and enlightened. I looked down upon people who did not call onto the power of the magical ganja plant to help alleviate mental and physical issues. 

I would actively avoid socialising with anyone who didn't identified as a stoner. If I did socialise with a sober friend, I would find reasons or excuses to leave early, just so that I could smoke. I felt like these people were limiting my good vibes. Get your sober ass away from me, and make room for more stoners. I had joints to smoke, laughter to be had, video games to be played, and munchies to be eaten.

Then it happened. The darkest night of my soul. On the night of September 16th, 2016, my roommate brought a dog into my apartment, and killed my 7 month old kitten. When I found his little lifeless body, I went down onto my knees, careful not to mangle his body further, and scream cried. I stayed with him all night. My eyes puffed up like marshmallows, I cried so hard. The very fabric of my soul was permanently stained with the blood of my kitten. The foundation of my being had destabilized. Almost overnight, I became a shell of my former self. I literally threw myself into my addiction. I was smoking more often, and stopped many forms of self care. During this time of my life, I developed a kidney stone. I was hospitalised, and had surgery. Around this time, my manager threw me under the bus and tried to get me fired. I was smoking so much, I would vehemently refuse to see anyone outside of work without first being stone cold and numb from being high. 

Looking back, I was ashamed, guilt ridden, angry, sad and traumatised. I had no idea how to deal with my emotions, so I turned up the intensity on the one coping mechanism that historically kept my sanity together. Turns out that it wasn't helping me as much as I thought, and I started to have suicidal ideations. I was in one constant state of panic. My heart was racing constantly, and I simply could not calm down.

Fast forward to 2018, I left my home country to build myself up from scratch. I flew across the ocean to separate myself from my past life. 

I was still smoking every day, but less intensely than when I was in my home country. 

I struggled, but managed to get a roof over my head, a job to pay my bills, and a group of friends who accepted me for my authentic, somewhat sober self. 

Fast forward to the present, I am sober for 36 days. During this time, I've had the worst nightmares, and often waking up drenched in sweat. I'd sleep a few short hours a night. I admit that I self harmed my way through an emotional flashback. It hasn't all been doom and gloom, though. I've been seeing a psychologist. I have been eating better. I work out. I am moving into a studio apartment. I can get addicted to this feeling of moving forward in life. I love that my memory and cognition are slowly coming back. I love that I can be free of panic attacks. I love that I can choose sobriety over being high.

To all my friends on whatever path to recovery you are on, know that it is worth it. You are on this subreddit for a reason. Whether you are on day 0, 1, 5, 31, 90, 420 and beyond...keep up the great work. Choose to love yourself without reservation or conditions. If you drop the ball and smoke again, pick it up and keep moving forward. **You are worthy, you are beautiful, and you are capable**. 

Live the life you want, unencumbered from adulterants that keep you perpetually in a state of fear. Beyond the clouds, there lies the sun. Compound your sober moments into days, and use that momentum to continue down your path to a sober self. You can do this, and I believe that you will succeed.  

RIP to my high self: 2009 - 2021",70,0

TODAY is day 1.","I have been avoiding this subreddit for YEARS. My smoking habit developed as a coping mechanism when I was 21. It was AMAZING when it started. I smoked daily barring 2 years. However, it stopped me from addressing my trauma and in a few years became so automatic that I didn't even think about it. I woke up and smoked, rushed back home from work and smoked, and I never, ever slept without being high out of my mind. I threw tantrums when weed ran out (where I'm from, it's difficult for women to procure), I desperately made others score for me. I suppressed all the shame that came with my dependance.

It started falling apart by the time I was 27. The last few years have been about therapy, self help and trying to understand my dependance. But I never stopped smoking. Weed was all I knew for giving myself comfort. I never learned other ways of being there for myself.

Now I'm in my 30s, with a cptsd diagnosis. Weed has become my biggest stumbling block in my therapeutic journey. My best friend for so many years became my prisoner. I started psychiatric medication and still couldn't stop smoking. Every night, I was left a husk of a person due to constantly smoking on top of medication. My psychologist and psychiatrist, bless them, gave me understanding and compassion and told me to take my time. 

The last of it ran out yesterday, and I told my husband to not score for me no matter what I did or said. It sucks SO BAD. I'm restless and irritable and UNABLE TO WORK and dreading sleep time. I'm reading through all the posts here to remind myself that it'll get better. I want to be free. 

I wish to make a post every day here to check in, participate and support people here so that it gets easier for me.

i thought i have never been the heaviest smoker and was conviced it is impossible that my habit has any big effects on my life. i was convinced my depression and anxiety is ""just"" there and that smoking weed would help me to ease my mind.

my habit looked like this: working everyday, coming home, going to the gym, smoking and eating. wasting my time with some sort of brainless activity. ""brainless"" not because i wasted time with netflix or something but even if i have been reading i couldnt recall about what i was reading. i was forgetting anything that happens to me. as if weed was a ""mental pressure cleaner"" that would wipe anything good out of my mind.

after not smoking for 14 days and living my regular life it started to be clear how much of a problem my ""small"" weed habit became. all my mental, social, work related, financial problems came from ""just smoking a joint in the afternoon"". it is silly to think that weed cant be a problem even if you smoke as low as 0.5g a day, like me. my social anxiety got fueled everyday for years and so was my depression. i really dont understand how stupid i was to think that it did not have any effect on me.

i was tired everyday and all day, i wasnt working out, weed lead to so many bad habits. doing other drugs on the weekend and drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. not talking to those i like and bashing myself up for irrelevant shit. it made me live in other peoples heads and that is honestly the worst thing someone can do.

if you smoke daily, you got a problem and you should handle it. weed will put a cloud on your life.

i am 14 days into living a normal life and i have so much to put work on. its crazy how i could not see it.

honestly it feels great to get a grip on my life.",247,0

Here are some thoughts to pay it forward from all the wisdom and encouragement I gleaned here. This is all from my personal experience and I’m no professional, so I say nothing with authority, just what works for me. 

Don’t see the negative side effects of quitting as negative, they’re natural, the more you avoid them, the longer you’re prolonging the processing of them. With bad dreams, don’t run away, embrace it. I die often in dreams, I finally embrace it and have peace in the moment of death. See it as a manifestation of your subconscious, not something to be run away from. See every side effect as info for you to observe and learn about yourself. 

Intentionally find out your “why”.  It took me weeks of considering this before I quit. Once I took out the “should” quit attitude and just focused on why I wanted to, is only when I finally did. 

At first I said to myself I only wanted to cut back, this is the only way I could coax myself into not smoking one night. Then when I thought of regulating/moderating myself I felt so heavy and helpless, I decided to take it off the table for the week. Then that passed and I considered taking it off the table for me for this lifetime and that thought felt so freeing, alongside a grieving of giving up a crutch I used for so long. But eventually I realized the crutch was great when I had a broken leg, but now I was ready to run and the crutch was only holding me back. I gave myself emotional and mental space to thank it for whatever I felt I was benefiting from it for all those years and said goodbye to it emotionally too. I don’t live with regret. If I feel like the years I smoked were a waste then that life would be meaningless and that pain would continue to drive me to want to numb out. I did the best I could at the time, beating myself up only kept me using. 

I also knew I wanted to have children and be the best mom I could ever be. I knew the mom I wanted to be wasn’t dependent on substances to self soothe every single night. I also tapped into the feeling of mothering my child, and imagined if my child was struggling with the same addiction I was. I thought about how I’d have them stop using and push through the discomfort of being sober, to be their fullest, most alive self. This was the final mental push/motivation that I used to quit. 

There are no tricks, be realistic that the moments that you don’t smoke when you usually do will feel like they’re lasting years. It might be really painful, and that’s okay. No one has ever died from feeling an emotion. 

Embrace sobriety with the same curiosity that you used to see in being high. It may not be as exhilarating or exciting, but it’s definitely a new state of being, and it doesn’t make being sober a vacuum, but a new phase of life. You’ve probably changed a lot since you were totally sober so think about getting to know your older self too as a new sober person.

I also stopped drinking when I stopped smoking because all I wanted to do when I drank was get high. I was never a big drinker so this was an easy decision but just something to be aware of. 

I’m extremely spiritual and I needed to believe there was meaning in me choosing to be sober in this time in my life. Even if you make it up, find meaning in choosing to give up weed in a meaningful, motivational context for you. Just knowing you “should” is rarely a good enough reason to stop smoking, especially when it’s being used to cope mentally and emotionally for years, for me it was. For me, the meaning was a richer, more dynamic life, where I processed my emotions and life every night when going to sleep, and processed all my social interactions without being high, in turn being able to grow and mature and enjoy my relationships and engagement with life more fully. It was having peace as I am, in any moment, as my peace wasn’t dependent on an outside force. 

To echo others, the positives may take a long time to show up, be patient, and you’re going to have to intentionally create the life you want to live. And everyone, even content people, feel sad and down and even terrible sometimes. I promise you I have, but I’m grateful that I allow my sober mind to process everything and learn as efficiently as possible by being sober and getting enough sleep and exercise, and engaging in loving and supportive friendships.

I've seen many comment on here - and have experienced myself - that one of the hardest things when you first quit is the queasiness and lack of appetite / digestive issues. This has me curious: what would be the best ""menu"" to support your body through the first few weeks? Do you have any foods that helped you? Is it smarter to go for comfort /favorite foods so they go down easier? Or max out on nutrition? 

I'm guessing it's going to be a balance and that each person will have different things that work, but I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts / experiences / recipies!

I also found that eating super small portions and eating more frequently helped me at least get some calories down when I felt like the last thing in the world I wanted to do was eat. On my personal things to avoid during withdrawal: fried foods, rich foods, heavy pastas, and meat were almost impossible to eat for me to eat.

I'm excited to research and experiment with what foods can be the most helpful / healing during this round of withdrawals for me. Hoping it will fill up some of my headspace to stay ahead of those cravings! 

Good luck to everyone and have a great day!

Craving started creeping up on m…on April 1st I was like I’m sure I’m done with the addiction and I will smoke just this time to feel high again, I wish I didn’t make that mistake!!!!!

I started smoking more than ever about 2-3 grams a day, I started getting lazy, I wasn’t doing shit, i went back to my old self where I was in a deeper hole than I was before… I started having CHS symptoms, I lost a bunch of weight, had no appetite even after smoking  vomiting in the morning.
I was like I need to quit but this time was kinda hard to make it day one, I kept relapsing 

Im on day 9 today feeling great I still have some cravings here and there, im able to sleep, nightmares are there but I don’t mind them, still sweating but im feeling good overall, got my appetite back and im taking it one day at a time wish me luck!!

I have been smoking it for about ten years. In the past, there were so many times that I was going to quit but didn't genuinely mean or believe I could do it - however, I know this time is different. Having recently discovered what I actually want to do with my life, and also just maturing significantly, I have never been more determined to finally stop smoking weed. My 'quit day' was yesterday and things are going fine - just vivid dreams and a change in appetite. 

However,

I have an interview coming up this Friday (via Zoom). Given how long I've been smoking, I'm hesitant that by the time Friday comes around, I would be somewhat more depressive, paranoid, and less confident, due to strong withdrawal symptoms. 

Can anyone share their experiences of quitting weed after such a long period? And, if possible, specifically the change in mood, paranoia, anxiety, etc.. that occurs within the first few days of quitting?

This time around I'm also experiencing some pretty bad issues with my stomach, at best just low appetite and at worst nausea and heartburn. Maybe I just need to take some tums/heartburn meds and that will help, but I'm curious if anyone else has found any ways to address eating a few bites of food and suddenly losing your appetite completely.

If all I can do is wait for the withdrawal symptoms to end then I'm sure I'll make through it but I reserve my right to be a bit of a whiny bitch and make things easier on myself lol.

All I’ve gained so far is more depression, more anxiety, I’m still constantly tired, I’m far more irritable, for the low amount I used to smoke, I’m wondering if quitting might have been a bad idea.

I’m 22 and I know smoking something everyday is not good for me, but since going raw dog thru life I’m just not having a good time.

Since I started smoking weed I had no need for anti anxiety or depression medication, the things i didn’t like about myself that I blamed weed on are slowly starting to seem like not weeds fault, I’m just at a crossroads.

I love this subreddit. I love seeing people fight their demons and get their asses off weed. It shows growth and serious self-analysis to make a change like this, especially if it's something that rules your life.

&#x200B;

I spent about 9 months free of everything. Weed, tobacco, alcohol.. everything. Then when lockdown started to end and I started seeing friends again, very quickly did it all come back. It all started with the stupid thought of ""it's been ages, you don't smoke tobacco, buy a blunt so you don't smoke tobacco and look after yourself."" well for fuck sake I knew that wouldn't work.

&#x200B;

Very quickly I started buying tobacco to put in my spliffs as buying blunts was too expensive. Now I'm back on the nicotine. again.

I sat down with myself and wrote in my Journal which I don't do often, so get some brain storming done. Fuck was it intense. I can't read it back. I had to tell myself over and over again to throw away the fucking weed and then come back. I was having a serious argument with myself, backwards and forwards, until it was gone. It made me realise something really scary, and something I NEVER wanted to think about, in the 6 years I've been smoking weed. I am an addict.

&#x200B;

It makes sense, I tick all the boxes realistically. I don't have a great deal of money at the moment but regardless of that fact I will put myself in difficulties because I can't not smoke. The idea of not having smoke is fine in the morning, but when the afternoon/evening hits, my mindset COMPLETELY changes and suddenly I'm fine with weed, I love it and I'm going to buy some. It's really fucking scary to think how drastically my brain can change my views on things.

&#x200B;

I think it doesn't help that I have ADHD too, which makes addiction a real fucking struggle on top of all the other things I am supposed to do.

I am done. Day 2. Fuck off weed.

I use psychiatric help and I am used to that some prescription drugs needs to lower dosage for a months. That everything takes a long time.

My initial idea with weed was therefore that I will need to lower my usage over a year or so.

It is just something I am doing because I am used to. It was again after a two weeks.

The most interesting thing is I do not find my friends interesting at all. They just smoke weed and drink and I find it pretty boring. Not sure I will invite them ever again because I have nothing to discuss with them.

My situation have changed, I have finally found the direction in my life (self-education, job, house, fitness, meditation) and I spend some time with girls I know (just friends).

Yesterday when bunch of guys arrived to my house to smoke weed, drink and discuss guns and do the mess I though just myself that I will be happy once they got out of my house.

For some reason cravings pretty much entirely went away for me , I still deal with a lot of other symptoms like low motivation , anxiety , mild depression , low energy , but the cravings are not really there for me after about the first week of withdrawl (on day 26 now), it could be partly because the last few times I smoked I had super bad anxiety attacks , not sure why I had them I smoked a lot of weed , like 2-3 grams a day of dispensary out of a bong and never had the anxiety attacks  until like 4 weeks ago (my last few times smoking , so it could be partly the reason why I don’t have cravings but just find it weird cause I see a lot of posts saying the cravings are just so bad.

When I got out I tried to get high again and it was just terrible. I'd get extremely paranoid, anxious, nauseous and socially inept. Some friends told me I should power through it, but if it was going to be that unpleasant I'd choose sobriety. 

I made some unfortunate decisions after that and took up addictions with other drugs which I have been sober from since January 2019 nearing three years!

I attribute most of my strength in staying sober to developing a regimented spiritual practice. I like to say that meditation saved my life.

I was a freshman at college last year, I moved on campus fall semester and ended up coming home in Nov because I was completely unable to function. I think that this was a combination of withdrawals, feeling incredibly isolated in a new environment, and my underlying severe anxiety and moderate depression. Not to mention I found out my thyroid wasn’t working at all (but that’s another story). It was the worst two months of my life in every way. I have never been sadder or more utterly hopeless. So, I came home in November, and got right back into smoking over holiday break. 

Now, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing this year, so I tried to quit in February. It lasted 5 days before I gave in and relapsed. I thought I could moderate - I could not. Since then I’ve been back to smoking daily until this week. 

For all intents and purposes, today is Day 1 again, I move back to college (the same one) in 8 days and I am absolutely and completely terrified. I just can’t stop hating myself for the stupidity of my decision; I should have stopped while I was still home, while I still had a support system, while I had time to start feeling normal again.

Now I’m having a break down because I can’t imagine anything worse than going back to college and working through withdrawals on my own.

My fucking addiction tricked me again.

At my first day home again I thought I could smoke with a friend. Just once. And here I am again. 

I smoked heavily the last 2 1/2 months and now I have reached the point, where I'm not getting high anymore.

It's pissing me off so much and I feel so much anger against myself for being so stupid to think I could handle that shit.

I know, that I should not feel ashamed for it. But I do.

I want to quit, but at the same time I don't want.
I know, that smoking pot makes my already anxious mind even more difficult to handle.
But on the other hand, I often feel like getting high gives me more confidence and less anxiety. But this could also be my addiction that keeps telling me reasons to not quit.

I hate this so much.

My mind rationalizes it so easy- ‘just one night!’ becomes ‘eh, go easy on yourself, how bad is it, really…’

Turns out for me at least, relapsing is part of this journey. Guess I needed to fall a bit to rise even higher. But I turned 33 a few days ago and it reminds me this isn’t the life I need anymore. Sure, tonight a joint would feel great, but long-term I need a clear head and my feet on the ground. And there’s no such thing as ‘just one joint’ for me. And for you, too.

It was a stressful trip but overall I had a great time. I traveled through a few states where weed is legal and saw a BUNCH of signs for weed shops. I was tempted to stop a few times but I was more excited about seeing my family, so I kept on keeping on.

After a wonderful week with the fam, I headed home and, while on the way, had to stop several times to endure panic attacks. I had no real idea why this was happening. It seemed like there was no reason behind them.

But, then I remembered that when I got back home, my aunt (whom I live downstairs from) would make me quarantine for two weeks because of her paranoia over COVID (we are both vaccinated). So, no visits to her place, no movie nights, no dinners together, nothing. I knew this beforehand, but it seemed like it hit me all at once on the way home. I have relied heavily on my aunt during my recovery and she has been a big help to me overall. Even before quitting weed we have always been great friends and I spend a lot of time with her.

The fact that I have to spend two weeks away from my support system is sending me into panic and has my depression spiraling out of control. My first thought was: Go. Get, Some. Weed.

And it has been the same thought over and over and over again. I know that if I smoke I will feel better. I wont care that I am alone and that I am not allowed to go grocery shopping or to have friends over (as it's been since the beginning of the pandemic).

Just had a really nice slide show with wifey and my daughter on the couch. We opened gifts too. She put together a photo album with pictures and quotes from friends and family. Felt so loved, even to the tender part of my heart that often hurts. 

Gotten a few phone calls already early on the east coast. Maybe too early but hey, nothing to complain about.

Got some sad news too. A friend lost his battle with cancer on Thursday on his birthday. Young guy. Late 30s several kids. He was a big help to me when i had paternal post partum (prob weed n booze driven) after my daughter was born. Thanks TS, love you bro. See you on the other side.

Cannot believe I’m sober on my birthday. Its been challenging. But worth it. So many emotions and thoughts have come to the surface. Grateful for them. Grateful for the chance to fight this battle and grateful for today.

Love you leaves! This community has helped me push through. 

Clear head, clear eyes and open heart. 

I will not smoke with you today.

Now I know Weed can prevent REM and this may attribute to the memory loss and poor impulse control.  
My theory is that now I'm finally getting REM sleep, I'm only now processing those emotions - a bit of a backlog as it were.  

These are thoughts/feelings that I haven't thought about in years - I've almost forgotten they even existed. They have been cropping up very vividly most nights and it feels like I'm 'working through them' if that makes sense. Seems strange that these were the years where I first started smoking, and truly abused cannabis all day - every day (struggled with it ever since).

Can anyone else relate? BTW it's taken me months and months of sobriety to hit this strange REM repair state, although I have abused it for nearly 2 decades now.",11,0

Drank lots of wine and smoked sigs last night at a spontaneous function, but feel no guilt for that. Realise is bout the (toxic) relationship u have with ur weapon of choice.","Hi guys and girls. I'm currently passing the 3 week hump and like I said I couldn't be more proud om myself. I've been smoking heavily for Bout 13 years since college. I'm from holland so our weed is mad strong as well. I decided to quit because I realized that even if weed gave me the vision of my potential is was blocking me from daring to put actual action to it. It made me fine and content with just knowing what I could amount to. I read another thread about the analogy of 1000 little sneaky wrong decisions and that one struck big time. I'm noticing I'm putting a lot more planning and action into my life. Trust me, baby steps for real, it feels new and weird and surreal to plan activities in the future where u know ur gonna be sober. And things u want to plan because u are sober. It feels like a new adventure, sometimes even scary to a certain extent, but as u can read good or bad they are actual feelings that come with it which is what the human experience is about. More and more I'm experience regular situations in a new way cuz I keep proving to myself I am fine with doing them sober instead of that strong weed voice telling me 'doing this high is gonna be so much more fun'. I'm honestly shocked how this dopamine addiction has completely flattened my neurons and sense of joy. Now I'm honestly just so curious to see how life would be if they would work in a normal manner again. Willing to sit it out for months to the moment where I can enjoy a movie on my own without needing drugs.

It's cool to prove to yourself that u don't need it and every day do you ur things without weed u prove to urself a little bit more u are zooo good without it. Now its time to make a 1000 good decisions by NOT smoking up and see what it gives me.

I already notice my anxiety and voice in my head and imposter syndrome is dialed down soo much more. I was just so insecure cuz I could not even control my smoking behavior, if I can't do that what gives me the right to do or even want other things. The most dangerous thought are that because I'm doing well I feel like I have it under control and I could smoke again, just one time in a controlled matter. The hard truth is I think that if I was able to do that. I would be doing exactly that, just smoke once in a blue moon. But I'm not that person and I know that so can't afford that lifestyle. With alcohol I'm like that, can go weeks without, like it but don't love it, fine with 1 glass of red, no triggers there. It's just hard cuz it does feel like u are burrying a good friend of yours, slowly. Just have to realize that friend was stabbing me in the back the whole damn time. At least for the years it wasn't serving me anymore 2 be clear. 

Last week I had a meeting I scheduled a meeting with the editor in chief of the biggest newspaper in my country. I expressed my ambition to do more presenting work aka be a presentor instead of doing my regular job which is being a creative and create entertainment shows and content. She always liked me but I was just good with the signs I got. Realized I needed to actually ASK for what I want instead of waiting for someone to give me what I was only desiring in my head. She was super receptive and is completely on board to make this shit happen!

Telling u guys quitting this crap could accelerate ur potential faster then u dare to imagine. Obvs the work is not done but pushing urself gives u more motivation to be the best version of yourself. Which is what everyone wants for themselves and what u deserve.

Happy to hear u guys and girls thoughts on this. Getting lots of strength from this community 🤗",11,1

\[first post on Reddit ever\] I want to tell my story and explain my reason for feeling like I'm ready to stop smoking. 

I (23f) started smoking in college (2015 at age 17) and over time it became a daily thing. I was a high functioning stoner,  smoking daily and still maintaining straight A's. It became my way of bonding with my friends, romantic partners, and some family. It started to impact me in 2018 when I had just started my graduate program in psychology and I was working as a pizza delivery driver part time. I was at a point where I had kind of wanted to slow down my smoking, but the guy I was with at the time wasn't there yet. One day he took my car to go buy before I had to go to work. I was almost late, so when he got back with my car I took it and drove off, and he left the weed in my car. I got pulled over that day because I apparently didn't make a complete stop at a stop sign, the officer smelled weed and searched my car. I ended up getting a ticket for possession and was put on a 12 month probation. I ended up violating probation a few months in because I hadn't been tested yet and thought I could slide a little longer, and I wanted to smoke for my best friend's birthday. I took a detox before my next probation appointment just in case, and lo and behold that was the day I got tested. Despite my detox, I still tested positive. I was able to avoid getting in serious trouble by taking a marijuana class. I also lost out on my dream internship because they worked with the court system, and due to my being on probation in the same county, I couldn't be employed there. Subsequently I ended up finding an internship site that was super toxic, I had to quit and find a new one, and the site I found was in an inpatient hospital which I hated. I could have had a good career with the dream internship and I still think about that from time to time...

After violating probation, I stayed completely sober for the rest of my probationary period. During this time of my being sober, I met the man that I'm with now. We've been together for a little over a year and a half. We live together, we have two dogs and two guinea pigs, he's talented and smart and supportive and amazing and I love my life with him. He doesn't smoke or drink (and has never tried either) for personal reasons stemming from his childhood. When I got off probation in 2020 I opened up the conversation about smoking and asked him how he would feel about me smoking occasionally now that I am off. He was adamantly against it and he felt like I should have ""learned my lesson"" from being on probation. I still snuck and did it anyway because I wasn't ready to give it up. I slipped up once and came home smelling like fresh weed and that sparked a huge argument. The topic of weed has only come up about 2-3 times, but every time it does it is very heated and emotional. The last time we talked about it, he acknowledged that he can't stop me from doing it but he won't be okay with it. 

Fast forward to now, it has gotten to the point where I smoke daily without his knowledge. I wake up before he does and go smoke while I walk my dog around the neighborhood. I smoke whenever I have an opportunity to leave the house by myself, whether it's just a run to the store or driving for DoorDash, and I take every opportunity to go and hang out with friends or family that will either provide me with weed or smoke with me. I feel so guilty because I feel like I'm lying to him and living this whole other life. Like I'm cheating on him with marijuana. I finished my last bit that I had bought last week and I feel like I want to just cut it and stop looking for opportunities to go smoke. I am not sure if quitting for a partner is a healthy motivator, but I really want to be the best that I can be for him and I don't want to feel like I'm hiding all the time. I am thinking about our future life together and our future family and I don't want to jeopardize any of it because weed isn't worth more than these things to me. I also can't afford to be spending as much as I do on it and know that quitting will help my pockets tremendously. I am experiencing a lot of depression and anxiety, mainly around financial stress, and my logic for still spending money on weed is that it ""helps me"". It's going to be hard to stay away from it completely since I have built my current social support network with friends and family I can go and smoke with since I can't do it at home.

I'm really anxious about stopping but has anyone else ever stopped because of a partner? Any tips/advice on how to stop? I know that being in my car is a huge trigger because I smoke every time I am in my car.",11,0

I started the spring break of 2020, and covid just launched me into a spiral. I was smoking all day every day. It went from 0 to full addiction in a month. At the height of it I was going through a cart and a half a week. I would get extreme anxiety when I even got within 2 months of running out.

After months of trying to quit and relapsing (usually the same night or the next morning), I sold everything weed related that I owned, and set on a mission. It was destroying my already poor social life and I was a husk of my personality. For a month after I could barely sleep, but after 2 or 3 months I kind of broke through.

I’m and unrecognizable person, and without going into too much detail, I am immensely successful in certain areas, and well off in others.

Lately life has been kicking my ass again. School has started, going a rough infatuation, family issues, etc… I look back on the past several months and realize that the thoughts of relapsing are almost daily still. The will just isn’t strong enough.

Since I quit, nearly every day I think “dang I really wish I could get high” or “I wanna try it one more time, I can only do it once and be fine”. The only reason I don’t follow through is the inconvenience of re-adding my plug and going through the process. It distracts my mind just enough to not follow through.

I can guarantee that if someone were to hand me some weed, even just enough for a few sessions, I would dive in faster than I could even notice. It scares me. I like the way I am now, but I cant shake this damn feeling.

I feel like the cliché “try it once and you will get hooked” thing really was true for me.",22,1

I keep getting these pins and needle feelings and full body tremors that don’t stop for most of the day. Only 2 days in and I feel like jumping off a cliff. 

  I’m trying to stop so I can get a real job. If I don’t get this job I’m fucked. I’ve been putting everything I can into staying sober to improve my life. I really don’t have much of a support system and it’s been a hard year (ruptured ectopic pregnancy, finally am recovered) 

  I exercise, I tried looking for psychiatrists (everyone is booked till nov) and my PTSD symptoms are flaring up. I don’t know even if I get sober I can work this job because of anxiety. I’ll just self sabotage like I always do. 

  I’m trying to be accountable and just power thru. Every time I sleep it’s my ex trying to murder me again. I wake up and everything hurts, I start shaking and even clean sheets on a bed feels like it’s full of stickerburrs. 

I go to Pilates, have to leave because my body feels like glass and I cry in the parking lot. I can’t even do any of the exercises correctly anymore and it’s really fucking with me mentally. 

  How do you get thru? I’ve quit once before and the night terrors were so bad my dad told me to finally smoke again (2 years ago) 

  I know why I want to quit, I have a reason and motivation but this pain is so much. My dad doesn’t think it’s that bad but he’s not here and seeing my current state. 

I don’t want to make excuses. I turned down pot twice already. But I’m trying to supplement correctly and eat and nothing is helping. It wasn’t this bad last time. 

  I guess this is just rambling but how do you get past the constant tremors, dark thoughts, self injury (I cut myself tonight to get some type of relief)?

Learned a few things during this time though. One being that my addictions are best friends with each other.

I didn't really have any withdrawal symptoms that I've read about apart from mood swings, debilitating anxiety and depression (which is why I started smoking in the first place). I found my appetite actually increased and my night sweats stopped. Which I find weird because I haven't been able to find anything online about weed actually causing night sweats, but it's been a huge problem for me for the last year or so.

My husband always said that for him after about 2-3 weeks he started to feel normal again (he quit about 18 months ago but has quit multiple times in the past). But for me, it's the complete opposite. I've been feeling so anxious all day, every day since I quit. I was hoping I'd feel normal again by now but now I've taken up drinking every night (only a couple) to deal with it. I end up with ulcers on my tongue because I compulsively bite and suck on it (the only way I can describe it) and I clench my jaw so hard that I end up with a sore face. I feel like I'm literally living in Hell with the way I'm feeling :( Just over a week ago, I had a horrible panic attack which I haven't had in a long time. To the point where my face and extremities went numb and tingly, and I couldn't stop crying for 2 hours. I even had to go to work with my husband when he got called in, in the middle of my panic attack, because I couldn't be alone.

I have quit in the past, I did a month last year with next to no problems. But for some reason, this time it's so much harder. I think it might have something to do with recently starting to see a therapist about my PTSD, anxiety and depression, so it's bringing all these things to the surface. And to make matters even worse, I live in NZ and we've gone back into total lockdown for at least a week, but probably longer. The feeling of knowing I'm going to be stuck at home and feeling this way makes me incredibly anxious and I almost want to go get some weed because I know it will make it all go away.

I don't really know why I'm posting this.. I guess for advice on how to get through? And I want to know what other people's experiences were with going through these types of withdrawals? Is it normal to still have crippling anxiety after more than 3 weeks? I read online somewhere that the anxiety and depression can last for years in some cases and it makes me so scared and nervous.",7,1

I don't want to go back to that cozy jail this drug give us. I am enjoying my self.",13,0

She called her fist up and let out an angry sigh and told me I was just going to start smoking again and I never stay concrete with anything.

I asked her if she was lashing out on me because my father is a functional alcoholic and he dosent want to change.


She told me no and then started calling me bald head and saying that I was fat and my makeup is trash.


She does get bullied at work as well...


But it is triggering me to want to smoke again as I have a medical card for it...

Here's my story - a bit long, but maybe it'd be of interest to some of you. I wrote it partly for self-accountability, and also to get your comments / perspectives / good vibes / questions.

Mid-30s. Divorced (5 years ago), no kids, single at present. Working a successful professional job, which requires a lot of brainpower, memory, hard work and commitment. And I had demonstrated those consistently over the years, as my work has always been one thing that I have treated with an almost religious respect (in the words of my toxic-yet-smart ex-gf ""babe, if you treated us nearly as seriously as you treated your job, we would still be together""). I've always allowed myself at least 24 hours before my work begins to clear up, with some very rare exceptions over the years (turning up hungover / weed-over to work once or twice in my life).

I have smoked weed since i was about 17-18; rarely daily (maybe in college, for a few weeks at a time), but consistently enough to say that I would probably smoke at more than a half of my cumulative days off, on average. Since my divorce, 5 years ago, my overall drug use has increased and now decreased again (I suppose I went through the festival and clubbing stage in my late 20s / early 30s, due to being first broke and then married in my early-mid 20s), but weed has remained constant. I would take breaks for weeks and months on stretch, when I had exams or other life circumstances, and I never had a problem doing so, but as soon as life would go back to normal, weed would be my drug of choice (I drink alcohol as well, but if i had to choose one for the rest of my life, i would definitely say cannabis).

The reasons I (used to) like to smoke (this is written with the benefit of therapy that I have done over the past couple of years, which shone light into why i feel a certain way -- I understand myself so much more now than i used to!):

\- calms down my anxiety and the ever-present ""you gotta work hard, you gotta try harder, what have you achieved in life? nothing yet!"" voice in my head, internalised from my childhood influences;

\-allows me to feel happy and present in the moment. Simply immerse into that tune, like there's nothing else; savour that dish; enjoy this kiss and sex, without doubting and questioning yourself constantly; take in the beautiful sunny day around you etc etc. We all know the peace that cannabis can bring;

\- I used to have little, if any side-effects from it: the next day, I would probably be a bit less focused and a bit more irritable than usual, but it rarely caused me significant trouble. And as I said, i'd take sunday to recover, and be fresh as a daisy on Monday anyway. I used to think ""gee, I could never run 5 or 10 km hungover, but after smoking last night, i definitely can!""

\- I loved the illegality and clandestine nature of it -- and some of my closest friends we would smoke with, feeling like we are doing something secret and therefore more awesome and cheeky;

\----

What makes me wanna quit now is the following:

\- the side effects -- ""the weed over"" is now worse, and it is emotional. It is also possible that I am going through a difficult stage in life (as does the world, with closed borders, uncertainty etc etc), or whether it is my age catching up w me, but my weed overs now give me a full blown depression for a day or two. No energy to enjoy life, sometimes barely fulfil my activities of daily living like shower and eat.

The way I see it, is I think that currently my baseline is not in my usual happy state, but probably a bit below euthymic -- over the past year, I have increasingly used weed to cheer up, and, following that, the rollercoaster of my emotions would drop much deeper than my baseline was, into a tangible depression, and would take a day or two to recover

\-again, side effects. I used to enjoy sex on weed A LOT. I have a lot amazing memories when i was high and making love. But now (again, not sure whether my age, or overall mental state), i find that weed gives me inconsistent libido. Weeks when I do not smoke, I still wake up with a hard on (which is a pleasant feeling!), but the days when i smoke daily (eg on a recent week off), I hardly think about sex. And definitely not the next day either

\-overall, obviously I could be even better at my job if i didn't smoke. It's a topic in itself, but overall if i did not smoke, i would have more control over the times in my life which i can take in with a clear mind: be it work, or, if God so has it, family and kids one day

Have nothing against people who smoke / do whatever other drugs that they enjoy, as long as it does not harm others. But perhaps my body is telling me to change his fuel.",19,0

I’ve smoked nearly every day for 3 years. At first I would say it was helpful to me, the high it gave me allowed me to get a lot of things in my life done surprisingly

It somehow helped motivate me to save up money to move out, get a new car, and finish the later parts of my weight loss journey (I lost a little over 80 lbs over the course of that) 

I would say weed was helping me, it really was, so I kept it up. I couldn’t tell you exactly when things changed, but slowly I started to smoke more and more as my system got so used to it, I eventually became the guy that smokes the absolute most out of my group of friends 

I now wake up in a day wondering how many times I can smoke and still be good to go to work later. I smoke at every opportunity on my days off to keep me high. 

I liked the high for a long time but now it isn’t what it used to be. I get more anxious, that motivation I had in the beginning has vanished, It’s turned me from being one of the most animated and social people out there to now being a quick tempered hermit, hiding myself away from the world who then becomes a snippy asshole when he has to leave his hole. This isn’t how I used to be. I miss always being so cheerful, even long before I started smoking 

But my body like craves it when I don’t have it. I don’t want to smoke, or buy more, or any of that, but it’s like I get scared at the thought of not having it, even though I know I don’t want it. I’m scared of not having the very small amount of good feeling it gives me

517,2021-08-21 15:40:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p8xuz7/first_3_months_clean_in_10_years_a_summary/,First 3 months clean in 10 years. A summary,"So today marks exactly 3 months since I quit for good and in a way it was a goal that I set myself.

I started smoking at 15 and like many of you here continued progressively increasing my usage as time went by, going from a once in a while social smoker to everyday to finally not being able to eat or do anything without being high. I fully embraced the identity of “the person that smokes weed” and saw cannabis as a part of myself and my daily behaviours. In the last years before I quit it got to the point where deep down I knew this was a problem. Really, I wasn’t doing anything about it, just smoking more to dull myself pushing my issues and intrusive thoughts away until the high wore off, rinse and repeat.

Thing is, those issues and important life choices that I was avoiding were still there and they only got bigger. I didn’t work, apply myself at anything, exercise, socialise and above all I didn’t have goals or a purpose in life. I realise my subconscious was freaking out, and this manifested itself in sever anxiety and depression. We subconsciously know that we are addicted and not doing well at all, seeing people and our friends get shit done while we seem to be stuck in place. Weed addiction makes you feel like you are glued to the ground and you are slowly observing everyone you know move further and surpass you, leaving you behind. This happens slowly and gradually and in my view is the most dangerous aspect of cannabis; it is a slow, gradual descent into misery. You are able to function somewhat normally, but over years you do not notice in what ways you are aggravating your situation. This gives you the illusion that everything is ok, the smallest achievements are intensified, there are no direct physical symptoms in the first few years and it’s now becoming a very accepted drug which is amazing. No one should go to jail for smoking but at the same time this ""weed is not a drug"" attitude can be mischievous and help us rationalise our addiction. This is a stark contrast with other substances where this downfall is much faster. You hit rock bottom at a greater speed, physically and mentally.

It took 10 years for me, and I hit rock bottom. I saw how much time I wasted being fine and completely ok with not doing anything; because I was high. I saw how depressed I was and not doing anything about it and after years of half assing sobriety and lurking on here while high I did it. I just said to myself : I am no longer an individual who smokes weed. My identity needed to be changed, I could no longer perceive myself as someone who smokes, I am sober.

Anyways, as everyone knows those three months are hell and I saw a great post recently that basically said that it takes much longer than we think to get better. I see a lot of posts on here of people saying that they feel a lot better in 2 weeks or a month or 3. It depressed me a lot reading them as I still feel strange and not normal at all, in a strange space. Not like myself when I was high all the time but also not how I felt whenever I was sober. But I realise that smoking from 15 to 25 almost daily has done a lot to my brain chemisty and my body is healing. It might take 6 months or 2 years but knowing that at least I am facing life how it is now and not running away from it helps me power thru it.

So how different does it feel? some positives are:

- I have goals and a purpose that I am trying to work towards.

- I exercise everyday and improved my diet, I have a greater appetite.

- decreased a lot of other instant gratification behaviours induced by weed.

- much less anxiety and paranoia

- I am more creative, make better music.

- I am more mindful and present in conversations

- saved a lot of money

- Dreams. Connection with my unconscious and learning a lot from them. Sometimes uncomfortable but a great learning experience regardless.

- feeling more happy and that I am actively improving and not staying behind.

However there are still some issues:

- I still feel very high everyday. This is the biggest one that scares me. This might be derealisation or brain healing but everything feels foggy and the best way I can describe it is feeling high without the euphoria or emotion that you get from smoking. It’s super confusing and scary and comes along with brain-fog. I just feel like it is a handicap and in a way it affects my motivation, ability to socialise or go out and do things. But I am grateful for this. This is the biggest factor that prevented me from relapsing and caused my view on weed to change completely, If im still feeling high after 3 months clean, what did I do to myself? This is not as harmless as I taught. I hope it will pass and I would love to hear from any of you who experienced this as well as it is quite strange and kinda rare too.

- decreased motivation, lethargy difficulty to accomplish things.

- short attention span, can’t focus on anything.

Overall this is it. My next goal is 6 months (21 November) and I will report again here, it helps with accountability and being part of this community. I must thank each and everyone of you. Those who post, those who comment and those who upvote new posts and everyone else that makes this community so great. Even if you still smoke everyday and are aware that it’s an issue and want to quit, you have made the first step. Being active in this support group slowly changes your perception on your usageat. For those who are undecided , trust me it feels much better to know you are not addicted to anything and improving yourself everyday. Stay strong and if you need help or support please pm me.",18,0

I always thought it was too hard to quit, or that I needed help and would never be able to do it alone. But someone told me that you just have to make a decision, it's literally my decision. Another piece of helpful advice is that to be able to manifest this goal, I have to say my goal in the present tense. Instead of saying I want to he sober or I will be sober, try saying ""I am sober!"" And say it until you believe it and can say it in a meaningful way.

I am sober
I am strong
I am worthy of love

That's my mantra for a little while. It's been 3 days so far. I had a night where I went out with some friends and ended up getting too drunk and having sex with my friend. I didn't want that to happen, it wouldn't have happened if I didn't drink. So that night made me decide that I am completely sober. No weed, no alcohol, no tobacco. If I want drugs I'll turn to exercise or simple meditation or just get out of the house into the real world. 

I am excited that my life has changed. It took a terrible thing happening to make that change, but all the same I am headed down a new path.

I was able to hit 3 months sober a while back and felt good for a time but ended up missing smoking so much that I gradually fell back into the habit. My problem lies with the fact that I genuinely enjoy smoking and getting high at the end of a long day. I have never been one to do the wake and bake and stay high through all my waking hours. Anyone I talk to tells me that moderation is fine if it's something I genuinely do enjoy but I still can't help but feel like I need to quit indefinitely.  

I live in Canada where cannabis is legal so it's a simple drive down to the liquor store and I can purchase it. Everytime I smoke I say it's the last time but then anytime I don't have any I cave and go buy more. I don't know how to break this cycle when it's something I I genuinely do enjoy.  

I have never found weed to inhibit my ability to do daily activities like exercise or chores and I am usually fine while sober at work. I maintain very good eating habits whether smoking or not as well. So you could say it doesn't impact my day to day too much but..  My mental health has been at an all time low lately. I don't know if it's my environment having gone through a lot of grief and trauma over the last few years but I feel miserable all the time and weed ""helps"" me feel better. Part of me worries that it's just a crutch and I need to learn to feel okay sober but I still keep turning to weed when I have down time. When I was able to get sober for a time I felt more at peace and calm at first but then my mental health took a nose dive and then I was just miserable but sober...

I’ve been smoking weed for about 10 years now (with about 1.5 years of nonconsecutive quitting due to fear of potential testing). I started getting nervous about lung/throat/mouth cancer and heart disease from smoking so about two or three weeks ago, I started solely doing edibles. Four days ago, I had an edible that I had pretty good experiences with as well as a little more of another edible I also had good experiences with. It ended up being too much and I had a terrible experience. I kept randomly getting this sensation of my heart jumping into my throat which took my breath away (which a google search the next day told me it was palpitations). I was terrified that I was having a heart attack and basically kept going into a panic attack any time I felt the sensation (which would make my heart race, scaring me even more). This went on for hours (I’d be good for a while and then suddenly I’d feel it and freak out). I was scared to sleep, terrified that I’d die in my sleep. Eventually I was able to get calm enough to sleep.

The next day, my head felt weird. I felt foggy and not all there. But I felt better than the night before. I decided that this shit isn’t worth it and decided to quit once and for all (was already considering it as I’ve become an extremely unproductive, depressed person). I don’t think I had heart flutters that day (or if I was just more distracted by the weird feeling i had).

Yesterday, the brain fog was gone, but the palpitations/flutters returned. I’m still having palpitations today. It’s not like continuous palpitations all day, but I’ll randomly feel them throughout the day. 

I don’t know if it’s anxiety (I notice I get them more frequently when I think about them or am panicking about them), the weed maybe still being in my system, weed withdrawals or  if I permanently fucked my heart. The palpitations aren’t intense, but they feel a little scary and give me anxiety (which makes me get more of them). Distracting myself helps a little but they’ll still show up once in a while (but do feel a lot milder than the night I freaked out).

It's been going well, I have not had any cravings, I can breathe a lot better, and I have been a lot productive.

I am in a pretty dark place. This year, I got a divorce after a lot of verbal abuse and my work contract will be terminated because I didn't perform as highly as expected in my research. I am an academic, and it's up or out, I just don't have the right publication count. My university if forcing me to submit a dossier so that they have grounds to terminate me. I am thousands of miles away from any relative, and my father has a new girlfriend, so I basically don't exist anymore.

Anyway, I am in a pretty dark place and my coping mechanism has been pot. I smoked half a blunt a few weeks ago when a friends was over, and it made me sick to my stomach. It was a very unpleasant high that made me paranoid, so I'm clinging to that. I just worry that I will end up convincing myself to go to the dispensary to buy pre-rolled joints and numb myself. 

I'm ashamed that I can't cope with all of this, and my mind is just stuck in a loop. I could go to the gym, but I can't bring myself to it because I am in an awful mood. It's a very cruisy gym and seeing people happy and cruising each other while I'm the depressed loser just upsets me even more. I can't take a nap either, so I have been watching movies.

I think it’s some hate for themselves cause they couldn’t do what I’ve done, admit you are an addict and do something about it. But that’s fine. I did it. And I’m doing better than I was before so. I guess for anyone going through extra bs it will get better and you will find your people that will love and support you. Those are the ones you should gravitate to.

Been a heavy smoker for about 1 ½ years and concentrated (lol) myself on concentrates for the last month.

Just to tell you that the next day after I quit was horrible. So here's a timeline with overall results overtime :




.






**Day 0 :** Last concentrate taken, it was after reusing again and again the same one until it was pitch black and discusting. I decided to quit Cold Turkey


**Day 1 :** Easily one of the worst day of my life, the confusion was invasive and had suicidal thoughts every 5 seconds. As a musician, I couldn't play and literally had to take my guitars out of the room


**Day 2 :** Huge improvement in confusion, but still very invasive, I can only listen to well known songs as the brain fog is massive


**Day 3 :** Same thing, just less worse. It'll be about a very slow improvement for the next days


**Day 7 :** Hell it's hard... time is long...


**Day 11 :** I just picked up my guitar and set up a white board to put all my infos so I won't get weird anxiety and won't forget to eat. I started to drink A LOT of water. I learned-ish a new song on the guitar, big steo

**Day 12 :** Woaw... I almost can live normally.



.




Sorry if it sucks, but it's what I remember haha. So imo those things are what helped me the most :


- Get a White board, put it in a room where you'll see in the majority of the time and write EVERYTHING you need : what you should do in the day, what you want in the future, your hobbies... it remind you that you are ALIVE !

- DRINK DRINK DRINK water

- EAT EAT EAT food

- Listen to songs you know VERY WELL, you don't want to force your brain in the first days

- Know that you don't think, THE WEED is thinking

- Rumination- thinking the same thoughts over and over, it’s very intrusive, often about imaginary events or a singular thing that happened, can cause paranoia. Kinda like being in a thought loop

- Imaginary audience- being convinced everyone is always watching them 

- Lack of prefrontal cortex development = terrible impulse control and bad decision making 

- Limbic system is raging due to hormones = seeking intense pleasure and reward (masturbafion, food, shopping etc) 


These are all things I struggled with while smoking all day everyday. I hear a lot of you struggling with similar things.

Weed numbs the trauma for me, it helps me function but it will **never** help me *heal*.

I also have a bunch of health conditions and my Doctor's have been begging me to quit smoking for around a year now. Weed is an anti-inflammatory so even if my chest wasn't so messed up, the weed masks the symptoms of my physical illness too (joint swelling and intense pain), so when I am using every day, I am making it harder for them to understand what is wrong with me.

I started smoking at Christmas, what was once a day became all day long, every hour… I enjoyed the way it calmed my loneliness and depression 

Sunday: 
I decided to stop. I didn’t smoke all day. That night I experienced awful anxiety, the kind that left me feeling very scared and I couldn’t sleep. Severe pain in my back. I have never really experienced anxiety before so it was a new and unwelcome feeling. I reached out to the one friend who might understand but they were asleep. I ended up calling an emergency helpline who took all my details and the physician was going to call me back but after an hour I fell asleep and missed their call. 

Monday:
Woke up feeling anxious, tight chest, back pain, terrified. Called the helpline again and they prescribed me something. Took about ten baths, I don’t remember eating, felt very alone. Couldn’t fall asleep that night. 

Tuesday:
Slept terribly. Still felt the same as Monday. Multiple baths. Found myself laying on the floor with my legs up on the couch. Deep breathing. Meditation. Trying to calm myself. Fortunately I work from home and it wasn’t busy, so I could avoid doing work.

Wednesday:
Slept terribly again. However woke up with a little tightness in my chest which slowly disappeared in the morning and I felt amazing throughout the day. I happened to have a day off work planned and so I was able to leave the house for a few hours for a facial and bought myself a nice lunch at a cafe. The weather was nice and I felt on top of the world. 

Thursday:
Slept well and woke up feeling good for a couple of minutes before it all hit me again. Massive anxiety, returned to having a few baths, deep breathing, meditation. Felt low. As bad as Monday. 

Friday:
Slept well and woke up with tightness. Throughout the day it cleared up and I was able to focus on work and function fairly normally. Cooked a nice dinner.

Saturday - today:
Still feeling as good as yesterday. No anxiety (not taking anything I was prescribed now). Very mild sensations in my chest. I’m feeling hopeful that this will clear up soon.

Need some support.","Today is 80 days of no weed or any other drugs/alcohol (I've done other drugs frequently but for the past couple years weed has been the most consistent, daily problem.) I've quit for a few months before then relapsed, but my memory isn't great of those periods. But this last 1.5 year stint of smoking was my heaviest by far, and it seems my PAWS are definitely worse this time around. I did have a brief pink cloud period, but for the last 40-50 days I've been quite depressed and anxious, and just do not feel like myself. My concentration and memory are also still not good. I can't tell if its getting better or not, and I get intrusive thoughts that (as others have described it) I've dug myself into a ""hole"" of serotonin and dopamine depletion, and that I will be this way forever. Just wanted to reach out for some support. Did anyone else feel like this around day 80? Did it get better for you guys? 

I would still take this any day over being an active addict, but it sucks.

Finally made the decision to admit myself into a private rehab facility. Weed is NO joke.,"I have been struggling with this addiction for what feels like a lifetime. My whole world revolves around my smoking. I made a similar post made about a month ago where I talked about struggling with this addiction and asking for advice as to how to stop on my own, and as you already probably can tell from me making this post, I failed. I used to have the strongest most inspiring work ethic, have hobbies that I actively participated in and enjoyed, and I could actually deal with my problems without having to rely on a bloody hit. Always worrying about running out, spending $400-$500 on weed a fortnight, sitting here numb distracting myself waiting for my next bong. The hardest part about facing the fact that I was addicted was that over time I found nothing else gave me the same ‘hit’ as a bong does. Not a joint, a dab, edibles, ect. I’ve also dabbled quite heavily (just to experiment) with harder drugs to see if it’s just my addictive personality. I can’t believe I could smoke what is considered the most addictive substance for days straight for months and quit without A SINGLE WITHDRAWL!!!! I still can’t believe it. Take prescriptions for months straight— quit again with LIMITED WITHDRAWLS!!! Was a tad annoying, but just shrugged the craving off. How???!!!

I now was even more confused with my addiction to weed as I couldn’t understand how the fuck I got so addicted to what is supposedly meant to be the most ‘harmless and casual’ drug. I smoke my mix with 50/50 ratio of tobacco and marijuana, and i also found weirdly enough that if I smoke straight green it again does absolutely nothing for me. It is literally the mix of tobacco and marijuana through a bong—NOTHING ELSE. 

Name a drug, any drug, and I promise you I’ve tried to see if I can get the same relief/hit that I can from just one bong and failed. It’s crazy and the power it has over me is absolutely disgusting. When I cry, I hold my BONG!!! And it legitimately is the only thing that makes me feel better—What the fuck is that??? 

The reason I made this post is to let other people that are struggling with this addiction to know that it is JUST, IF NOT POTENTIALLY WORSE, THAN SMOKING ANY OTHER HARDCORE SUBSTANCE!!!!!! Do NOT underestimate this drug!!!!! Do NOT listen to these rappers in their songs preaching about how they smoke weed to have fun and feel better. Do NOT look the other way once you start noticing yourself developing these addictive symptoms ‘because it’s ONLY weed right?’ NO!!!!!! Please BEWARE!!!! If you see any of your friends going through this please be there to support them and help them realise how serious this can get. Don’t end up like me and leave it too late to the point that the only thing u live for is this substance. Don’t.",82,0

I realised that the whole week has just blurred by and feels like a second and a forever at the same time. I've been here before and it's getting old.

I want to punish myself and be ashamed but I won't be. I haven't sinned, I haven't failed. I did something harmful to myself out of fear and habit. I knew that I wasn't doing the right thing as I smoked again, I smoked until I wouldn't think about it anymore, then

I realise that I don't even like weed anymore. 

I just miss it.

I don't know how to unpack this feeling. The idea of smoking and the banal reality. It's actually boring and mind numbing. I stopped reading, thinking... I became extremely sensitive to everything, physically and emotionally (more so than usual ND life)

Don't punish yourself for this is something I try to keep in mind right now. Try to be kind, because anger and anxiety never worked with keeping sober and being honest with myself. 

Is it an instinct or a norm to equate anger with being honest with oneself? It feels like the most intense way but shame and anger directed at myself doesn't work. I understand why I ended up here again, it took me a week to face it again because I feared the shame. I feel it but I won't enact it, here's to being kind to myself even when I've done wrong by myself.

When is my life going to improve?,"Hey everyone. Allow me to share what’s been on my mind for several years, but especially recently. I know this post is long, but I poured my heart out and would love if even one person could make it through to the end, just so someone out there understands my story:

My memory and attention span are not what they used to be before I started abusing drugs. This makes it extremely difficult to explain things in conversation and elaborate on my responses. I feel that I have this extreme social anxiety because of a persistent brain fog that was caused by my taking edibles and smoking nearly every day since 2017 (with some month long breaks here and there). Since August of 2019, I was consuming 10-40 mg of edibles every day. They became my way of coping with transferring to a new university, and again with the pandemic and being forced to stay home. I have a lingering belief that, although some other recreational substances are probably responsible as well, marijuana has greatly diminished my ability to maintain a conversation for very long. Except for some slip ups, I’ve been clean since early April this year. I mostly look forward to each new day thinking it will slightly improve my memory and concentration, to get back to a point where I can actually enjoy conversation like I used to, but still, my brain feels so dull and directionless and I ask some pretty asinine questions. For some added context, I am on the autism spectrum but high-functioning, so my word choice in social situations hasn’t always been stellar. Throw depression, and recovery from chronic polydrug abuse into the mix, and you have my current predicament.

In four days, I begin graduate school with a Master’s in Public Health. I moved to San Francisco a week ago for it. Yet, I feel out of place in this setting. I know that it will involve interactions with many new people all of the time. I am drawn to the possibility that I can start to develop my professional skills, I think there will definitely be a good number of opportunities that help me break out of this mental confusion, but I don’t feel  prepared to embrace and grow from those experiences. I understand that many others in my position wouldn’t feel ready either, with the COVID-19 pandemic and all, but I still see them with a cheery demeanor and a reasonable grasp of the English language under pressure. They can hide their internal strife much more easily than me.

For months and years, I’ve been doing all the activities I ever thought could help to improve my mood, memory and concentration. And yet, I’m not getting nearly the amount of energy I need to maintain a conversation for as long as I need to. It’s leading me to believe that I’ve finally dug myself a hole of serotonin and dopamine depletion I can’t get out of, forced to live a subpar existence at best, even when I am making the healthiest lifestyle choices possible for the day.

I can start almost any conversation with a “fake it till you make it” attitude, and come up with witty responses and open ended questions to ask the other person, but I get socially fatigued pretty easily and then derive zero joy from that interaction. My smiling muscles just wear out. I know that if I could follow my trails of thought all the way to their end, and articulate things more clearly, I would immediately have more desire to socialize because I would have more meaningful and thought provoking topics and things to bring up (which my mind is usually swimming with, but either can’t fully process, or find the words to express) instead of reverting to forced pleasantries and generic one-liners. Only a short bit into an interaction with someone I’m trying to give a good first impression to, I’m not able to artificially smile any more and I become self aware of my flat affect. If you ask me, the reason for this is largely because I am removing my longtime and most trusty coping tool at the same time I am undergoing a fundamental shift in how I go about my day. Talk about a challenge.

To recap: I find little to no interest in almost anything I do, I get near instantaneous social fatigue, I used to be incredibly gifted at befriending strangers and going with the flow, and I’m not getting many signs that things are improving. Basically, I just want to feel like my pre-druggie self, full of limitless curiosity, imagination, contentedness and ambition. 

So I ask you, if you’re willing to share: How long did it take you to feel like your head was above water? What hobby or behavior change helped you the most? What part of my story can you relate to the most? If you have any advice, I’m always open to it.",7,3

I like to tell myself I started smoking to fit in better at school. I was very insecure about myself and I would even get bullied. It wasn’t a physical bullying but you know what I mean if you’ve ever gotten bullied before. I’ve gotten in trouble countless times as a juvenile, including TWO suspensions at school because of weed. My family is extremely against any drug use. Eventually they got tired of my consistent lying and disobedience. I got kicked out of my house at 18 because I refused to make a change. I kept making the same mistakes, only the consequences each time got worse and worse. When I was homeless at 18, my parents told me I could move back in on one condition: I seek help from a rehab for my pot use. I agreed. I was clean for 10 months. A week after the conclusion of my program, I was already back doing the same things. My parents offered to send me back to rehab I chose to move out instead. To say the least, being out on my own has proven to be a less than positive experience. As I type this, I am currently at the lowest point in my life. My family does not want any part of me unless I am clean. I may be homeless again if I don’t find a new place to stay before September. I tell myself everyday that I’m going to quit, to make things right between my family and my girlfriend. But putting down the herb and cutting off basically all of my friends is very difficult. It’s even more difficult because my birthday is on the 27th of this month and I have to make the decision to continue to be clean or go out with a bang and then stop cold turkey. Any advice?

I wrote this huge note for myself to read whenever I’m craving really bad but it’s in russian and was written while being high, so today I feel like telling my story properly, partly because I want to make myself feel responsible (as I’ve always respected r/leaves for the platform, non-direct connection and inclusion it gives), also in hopes that my whining would resonate with someone.

Not even close to being my first attempt, I’m 19 and mentally still am a heavy smoker of 2yrs which is constantly being shown to me by the way I behave (in any sense) and the way I fall for these spiral-like patterns of self-destruction. 

Today is also the day I came home to visit my parents at my little childhood town which I moved in pursuit of a higher education. Haven’t been here for a little over a year as well - everything feels crying. Everything bleeds with profound sadness and regret, it’s crazy and I don’t think I can clearly enough put that feeling into words. I can’t even look my mom in the eyes without huge waves of crying at the abyss coming up to my throat. 

I’ve been depressed since before becoming a full-blown stoner but nothing I felt before the addiction could compare to what I’ve been experiencing and the way I kept digging myself deep throughout these awful and not-in-a-pleasant-way-forgotten years. I feel like I’m not just some depressed, autistic and anxious kid that I used to be. I almost feel like I’ve become completely dysfunctional both mentally and physically - it’s like I won’t ever feel or (which is much worse) more or less commonly/objectively will be perceived as some healthy, socially balanced and stable human being. But the thought of me being incapable of adequately rationalizing anything due to being depressed and during withdrawals is comforting enough at this point. 

I’ve never found the right way to become one of those healthy individuals, although I honestly never wanted to be that either - I’ve always wanted these 9 circles, always wanted to feel connection to the hidden insides of this reality, maybe, so I had to violently cut it right open with anything reconstructive (e.g. ideas, drugs, patterns of behavior). Eventually, I still came to a bigger void. But around 17, I also came to weed as a temporary solution to anything from shifting mood to be more engaged into social stuff, up to sleeping, eating and whatever else that has to be done to continue existing. Obviously, from trying to exist through what now seems like occasional difficulties, I traveled up to sleeping through life as a whole by becoming a daily smoker.

I am physically ill from it. I think I might even have those earlier stages of chs with constant nausea, stomach pains and whatever. I’ve got constant dandruff and minor hair loss from fucking up my eating habits and going from really insane overeating to now never being hungry enough to get me a decent meal even while being high (besides maybe one ordered/frozen dinner a day and stuffing oatmeal in my mouth every morning to be functional). Besides that - obviously lungs (to add, I’ve been a tobacco smoker from 14 as well).

I want it all to stop. Everything screams for it to stop. And I CAN stop. Though the faster you go, the longer that stoppage gets, but you can’t slide forever. Without maybes and tries. It’s just happening right now and that’s it.",5,0

I enjoy getting high but I also hate how lazy, fat, and dumb I am while stoned. I also like that my perception of the world is so much deeper than sober. I can have deep thoughts on things about life that normally sober I never even think about, that’s is also something I don’t want to get rid of.

TL;DR - after a few days of feeling completely frantic and depressed with tinnitus, I'm starting to find a bit of calm, I have some optimism and I'm not having the same urges. The noise is still there, but improving, and it's not provoking fight or flight any more. 

-

Hi everyone, this ends up being positive so stick with it. Particularly if you are in the first few days of withdrawal and are suffering from tinnitus.

I have been a very long time reader of this sub, on various accounts, waiting for the right time to quit. Well, in the end, the quitting was kind of enforced.

Until last Sunday I'd been smoking 5/6 straight pipe hits a day for close to 10 years, with some periods of more and some less. Homeworking was a killer and I'd get high before, during and after work. As much as I told people I loved working from home as I didn't have to mingle with colleagues, the truth is I just liked getting high all the time. Over the last few weeks I'd been gradually reducing it, but on Sunday, I hit the lowest point of my life.  

The crisis started when I noticed a brand new, high pitched ringing sound in my ear. I've had a very low level I could deal with for years but this was horrible. Like squeaky breaks but constant. This sound drove me so mad, the only thing I could do was to harm myself or worse, to make the sound stop. I was absolutely frantic, depressed and cried my eyes out for the first time in years. I ended up in A&E (ER in USA) with suicidal thoughts almost begging them for some relief, that they obviously couldn't provide. 

I saw an ENT, audiologist, ER doctor, before eventually getting transferred over to psychiatric care as my ears and hearing seemed fine. I was very nearly admitted to a psychiatric hospital but instead I was referred to a Community Mental Health Team, they make home visits to keep people out of wards as much as possible. 

Today I'm only on day 5 and the suicidal thoughts have reduced enormously. I'm being seen every day by mental health professionals that are coming to my house to check on me, and I've been prescribed meds short term for the panic attacks, they occur mostly when I wake up, as it's the first noise I hear. 

The ringing is absolutely still there, but it is not making me suicidal. I've been reading on this sub that for some people it's days, and some people it's months, but the ringing does go away and that is providing me relief. 

I have an MRI scan tomorrow to rule out ear problems and I'm seeing an ENT on Monday, but at this point after all the reading, and the fact they didn't find anything the first time, I'm putting it down to stress, withdrawals and just sheer panic. 

The point of this post is to say that in those first few days, I really could not imagine a life without this horrific noise in my ear. No matter what anybody told me, I thought this is my life now, and I cannot cope with that long term. But the hours slowly went by and the days slowly crept up and I've almost found myself in a place of optimism, the ringing isn't provoking that fight or flight and I'm able to use copying techniques. 

Short term, some things that really helped me, being near running water like a river, getting engrossed in games like RDR2 that help move the tinnitus to a background noise, and not sitting around moping and fixating on the noise, no matter how hard that is. Also showering. 

I've been referred for CBT for tinnitus, and the audiologist mentioned there are constantly new treatments coming out for tinnitus even if it does stick around.

I feel good, and if you'd have said I'd feel like that on Monday, I'd be genuinely angry at you for not realising how bad it was. I haven't even thought about smoking since the crisis, I'm too scared of the ringing increasing. And I found it completely impossible to quit before that. 

I'm happy to answer questions - my replies might not always be speedy but I will get back to you. 

Stay strong - you can do it and it will get better. And if you're in a place where you feel you can't keep yourself safe, please go to the ER.",5,0

This post is mostly for myself to look back on but thought maybe there's a chance someone else could benefit too. 

Fwiw, I started smoking at 15, but didn't start using daily until around 18-19. 24 now so 5-6 years of daily use aside from a few tolerance breaks, but I was never serious about actually quitting when I did those. 

Things I gain from staying off of weed.

- Massively increased motivation to work on more productive hobbies (exercise, learning an instrument, studying various subjects of interest)

- A much clearer head, easier to remember things especially short term memory. 

- Much better socially in everyday conversations. More expressive.

- Saving a lot of money.

- Don't have to worry about the chance of getting in legal trouble for driving high. 

- Lungs stop hurting.

- Increased focus and ability when exercising or playing sports, or doing just about anything really.

- Getting enjoyment out of everyday things again. 

- Not wanting to always leave events or gatherings early to go get high

- Way less anxiety and paranoia

- Healthier eating habits

I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting too. 

Most of the things I loved about smoking weed I already have now (new perspectives, new friends and memories etc) and the more I smoked the less positives I found in it. It took me a long time to realise that the very thing that helped me find happiness years ago was the very thing holding me back from happiness now.",68,0

I smoked and vaped, on a wake and bake basis, since August 2010. I just turned 42, and sobriety was my gift to myself after spending my thirties in a haze.

I tried for years to quit, over and again, justifying my return to weed each time by saying that it made no difference in my life after I stopped. Trust me: it does. I don’t think I ever gave myself enough time to really see the difference until this past month.

More importantly, I have so many of you brave souls to thank for giving me hope, for inspiring me daily, and, ultimately, for convincing me I could do this and stick to a plan. The last 31 days have not been easy by any stretch, and who knows what the next month will bring, but I’m at a point now where I feel like I’m really trying hard to live my life. And I feel good.

I also had to move back to my home country last year while all of my friends are still in the States getting to live some sort of normalcy. Not to mention my home country is in a failing state.

It just feels so unfair to me when everyone else is getting to have fun and live their lives while I have no friends in this city. I also hate how I feel resentment towards my parents and my friends sometimes even though I’m completely aware that whatever I’m going through is a consequence of my own actions.

At the end will be the story shortened in few sentences..lessgoo  

Hi G´s, i red a lot of ur stories, and i just think u have too much time to think about u are without weed so u think about “good times” when u had stuff and how will be life better with few bongs or puffs every day..  

I smoked about 7-8 since 13-14 years old child and it ofc changed everything in my life, changed permanently brain thinking (which is fact, dyor). First years it was just about coolness, went out and meet with boys every day and smoke allday everyday and just enjoy it.. 

The studying was harder for me since we all went on prestige highschools but not private so learning stuff was on my daily plan but how time went i started changed priorities and realize how school not paying me and when i told mum when we argue that i want to live alone because of privacy, she saw only reason why i want this - cause i dont wanted to argue about my smoking and she started with: ""If u want to live alone, u need to earn ur own money!"" At this point i started realize how bad is weed thing in eyes of parents which never try that. So i did exactly opposite of what my mum thought i will do, i find easier school and 8 hours night shift job where i studied and went to live in flat with one of my friends...(Which went into realizing that school really not paying me and i dropped out and start private lessons only about things i really want to know) I DIDNT QUIT STUDY, just study want i really want to..Which is absurd that school system not giving u that oportunity)

 I allways had passion to do some art/hobby stuff, but i fell in love with making music.. since i was living alone and have more time cause i didnt need to study that much i allways think im artist, making things.. but true which I didnt want to accept was i did 2 song in 2-3 years which didnt even popped out and that was it?! It was somethin like.. ""Yes today im coming in booth with had full of good ideas but its everything ends when i arrived and smoke with fellas and stopped on watching neftlix or just chillin...its went on and on which i realize after 5 years doin that...

Smoking really giving you hell of a time of procrastination and thats the time which u need to use beacuse if not... life is just going through ur fingers and u cannot realize because ""u just feel fine all day and u have plenty of that time""...that was my excuse, which cannot change if u not change it...

Now its 5 weeks since i quit smoke, i had a lot of time when i said to myself ""I can stop smoke when i want to, BUT I dont want, so why now...?"" before month I was planning vacation with family and i realize somehow that now is my right time to leave my comfort stereotype zone and use that time when i will not be able to smoke to leave it for a while... Unfortunately my vacation wasnt that good in few things but was my best in lifetime..My abstinence symptoms after daily smoking of 5-8 joints or 5-6 bongs every day were that bad that I wake up and went sleep with 40 degrees fever.. which were hard to me even i smoked ciggs all day and drink alc..didnt help...

BUT after I arrive.. I was clear for almost 2 weeks..symptoms went out.. I am every day in same zone..weed is still around me everyday, my friend not pushing me into that which im glad i have them and i dont even have taste when i smell it or see stuff and i freaking love it.. Many people here describing how time stopped for them when they stopped smoke.... EASY -> just dont sit on ur A$$ and start doing things man...stop counting time it will not came back... I did so much music since im clear minded about that that i dont have time to finish it all but im just focusing on small steps on infinity big ladder.. its all in head and about how u use that time when u not  smoking..

The reading is so long that i dont even know how i write that in 10 mins and I dont even want to write more, but last thing from me is that im praying for everyones journey.. hope u will have it better easier than me and u will  persist and set goals.. good luck to everyone

PS: If someone will mind, we just dropped EP :D I can share it into comments, will be my pleasure to hear ur honest opinion

&#x200B;

TLDR: Started like child, arguing with parents, problems in school and reason was weed obviously from their view. Changed my mind, used oportunity on vacation where i wasnt able to smoke. Quit for five weeeks now, feelings best. Productivity in everything went 1000% up, dont even have time to thing about procrastination. U need to have hobbies and use ur free time, try to find goal, small steps are big steps when u look back. Good luck to everyone guys.

i recently ( 5days ago) had to quit, because all of my weedconnections were dry. i didnt want to stop, thats my problem right now.
its available again and now i have. this issue with willpower- should i just ease my mind, spend shit ton of money again, to feel happy tonight? i know the smarter way would be to just keep surfing on the sober wave, as i have already had the worst nights, shivers, sweats etc. it would be sooo dumb to just get in this weedcicle again. 
i want to ease my mind so bad.
a little more info about me: 27yo, smoking since 14yo. quit when i was 23 for a year after attempt.suicide. Weed was always around me. my parents were hippies, my mum has MS, so it was normal for me to have weed in the house, f.e. i always used it for period cramps etc. it was never a secret, weed was like a medicine in our household. my dad was an alcoholic, so he enjoyed smoking once i while with me. i enjoyed it so much, to feel like this belongs in my life. both my parents got struck with cancer, so i started taking care of both. but they fought about who is sicker and who is gonna die sooner, i paid so much more attention to my mum, because she was always sick, and she kinda demanded more work. and the doctors gave her only two more months. but actually my dad was the one dying. he was my best friend. and i miss him so much. he died in february, i was by his side. took care of him at home, saw his last breaths. i smoked with him till the end to ease his pain (very painful pancreatic cancer). my mum is still alive and going strong but i regret taking care of her so much, instead of my dad. 
as i said i quit, not so freely, five days ago, and im fucking scared of all the things jet to pop up in my head. 
thankful for communities like this, 
i feel awful stupid right now, that im suffering months after he already died, and im really afraid of reality and other harsh things coming up to me
i have a really lovely boyfriend and im still studying, so im probably i a good spot to stop right now.. my problem is, i didnt intentionally want to right now, i just feel like swallowing everything, get everything behind me, smoke some shit and be fine again. the problem is, this being fine wont last.. thats what keeps me from buying some rn...",9,0

Weed is ruining my potential...,"I just relapsed after 3 days of not smoking. It wasn't this hard the first time I quit, albeit that time was not by choice and it was the one thing on my mind from 2017-2021.

Little background 

I tried weed when I was 16 and visiting family abroad and wow. I fell in love. My origins are from the middle east and this is a big nono in my country. My life mission was to escape the shit hole I lived in and get to some where I can do this again. 

Lo and behold I got accepted at an American university. I must've spent... 10 grand? On weed alone... During those 5 years, I smoked DAILY. I noticed myself becoming a shell of the person I used to be but blamed it on the unfamiliar culture that I thrust myself into. Even friends I made were exclusively stoners, otherwise we had nothing in common. Had no girlfriends during university because I thought that I would rather get myself blasted

I got caught by family a week before graduating in 2016 and it was heavily implied by family that I would either move back to the middle east post grad or be disowned. Regardless of whether I quit or not, I hate my family, but that's a story for another day. 

The next 4 years were hell. I am thankful for my family for letting me stay unemployed for 6 months and rent free while I battled withdrawal. I eventually got myself a job and realized that despite graduating I don't fucking know anything and legit learned zero skills. Fucking business comms man. Don't ever take that waste of time. Anyway I self taught accounting to myself and got an even better job 9 months after my first job. Look at what I can fucking do sober!!! This was such a great job, huge corporation that taught me so much. Pay was shit though because fuck the middle east. 

The entire time I was there my only goal was to save up some money and find a job in the states. To smoke weed again. 

I had somehow convinced my family that it was no longer a part of my thinking despite thinking about it every day. 

I quit in early 2020 then covid happened. Early 2021,I finally find a job at GREAT fast scaling company that is just freaking amazing. 

6 months in to this new job, I KNOW that I am under achieving despite my colleagues all telling me the opposite. I've missed multiple meetings due to smoking weed all night and watching anime. My state is fucking legal too lmao as if it could be any easier to get my hands on weed. And then vapes are a thing now?? Holy shit being able to smoke whenever wherever???? 

I'm scared of losing a great job and becoming a corporate slave somewhere else. 

I'm scared of being satisfied with playing vidya and smoking weed all night well into my late 30s.

I HATE THAT I WASTED THE BETTER PART OF MY 20s AND MY ENTIRE UNIVERSITY LIFE ON THIS DRUG. 

This stops now. 

My first week into quitting I decided that I would go see my old university buddies but without smoking weed with them. I would only be drinking. 

Holy shit what a lame mediocre couch potato loser ass group that was. They are going nowhere FAST. They made fun of me when I told them I was quitting weed and didn't want a hit of the joint. I stuck around for the rest of the night as I had a lot of history with them but wow I remember leaving MAD AS HELL. How did I waste my time with these people? I could've done so much more, instead of just gluing myself to a couch and ordering a pizza, happy to be leech for the rest of my life. 

Now the insomnia starts. I stay up till sunrise and get 3 hours of sleep before going to work. If I was under achieving then, I was definitely under achieving now. My boss noticed it too despite her being such a chill person about it. 

So I started taking hits at midnight to be able to sleep. 

That's the longest I've went for.. A week. Today, I relapsed off of 3 days of no smoking. I just discovered this subreddit. 

Hope this will be the final step towards recovery. I'm cold Turkey-ing it again tomorrow (I don't get high at work ever)",15,1

I was recommended by a friend to come visit this subreddit. I can already thank him for that because I feel it can really help..

So, I've been smoking for 3 years now but as an addict, it's been 2 years. I started smoking to release the stress, anxiety and depression. It was never intended to become an addiction obviously but it helped so much that one day I just noticed I was under the addiction.

Yes, in the first year, it helped a lot. I was another person (in a good way), because it was so helpful but it got to the point where it doesn't help that much but it makes it even worse like no motivation at all and depression still here..

I've been trying to stop for the past 3 months but it's really really hard since it was something that helped me a lot and it still helps in a way but in another way it makes it worse, like I said before.

Im quitting again. Just threw all my shit away. Weed literally makes me a shit person,"Im gonna try to keep it short. But I won't be able to.

There's so much to get out of my chest. I really appreciate everyone who reads it. I need you.

I'm a 27 yo Brazilian. I'm a lawyer which here in Brazil is a profession of high regard and money. Just like on USA. Most of my friends from University are making good money already. 

I have graduated and got my license to be an attorney almost two years ago. (here in Brazil you have to take an exam to become a ln attorney after you graduate on university. Roughly 80% of lawyers who graduate can't get it)

But I'm broke. Living in a friends apartment and sleeping on the living room. My mom is a heavily toxic narcissist so I can't live with her and can't pay my own rent so I'm sharing the rent with my friend.

And I know that's mostly because of weed. 

I was a bright and very intelligent kid. Passed all my exams with great grades. Still as an adult I'm very intelligent. Shit I'm a fucking lawyer. Took 5 years of classes on the best University of my state. Took an exam that 80% fail and passed a year before graduating.

 But I can't do shit because I'm always high on weed and and get very paranoid about everything in my life when I smoke. Weed gives me panic. Ive know it for years. But I am not being able to stop it.

Started smoking at 18. Smoked very little for 2 or 3 years. Like every three or four months. Was something I enjoyed but never thought I was gonna get addicted to. Actually I was always afraid of it. But then gradually started smoking more and more and before I was able to  realize, I was addicted to it.

7 years ago, 2014, was the first time I realized I couldn't go a day without weed. I was 20. And I smoked more then just to sleep all of this time since then. Wake and bake.

I feel like I fucked myself up. I can't work properly. My work is very mental and it's very hard for me to sit and concentrate on writing and researching something. But I still smoke first thing on the morning. I could easily be making 20k a month but I'm barely making 2k I should be feeling terrible about it but weed makes me feel ok.

I'm done. 3 months ago I stopped smoking for a month a half and was the best most productive month I had on a long time. When I'm on weed time seem to fly. The last three months were spent smoking and It seemed like it time was faster than the month a half clean.

Weed takes away my joy. Makes me complacent. Weakens my character. Makes me take a thousand little bad decisions that over time fuck my life up.

I'm done. I know the next three or so days are gonna be shit. But I can power through it. The first week is the hardest. The second is a little bit better but still shit. But after this time I know I barely think about weed anymore and don't have much cravings. 

I have to stop watching fucking YouTube videos and wasting my time. I can and will live a great life. And I know the very first and hardest step is to quit this shit drug who makes me the shittiest version of myself.

I'm gonna back here daily and report my journey. Be with me. I wanna look at myself years from now and thank myself for taking this decision right now. Some people can smoke weed without problems but I surely I'm not one of them.

Do this, do that. Take it day by day, cold turkey, taper down, keep a pack of cigarettes in your pocket, etc. Many methods were tried by me over the years. Did they work? Well the short answer is no, because until 14 months ago I kept finding myself back in the cycle of weed addiction. 

When commenting on another post in this group earlier today it occured to me this: we each become addicted in unique and individual ways. Sure, there are a lot of similarities and there is a lot in common from one addict to another. However, each of us is distinct with our own distinct problem, our own reasons for continuing to use. 

""Quitting"" never worked for me. When I stopped in June 2020 it was markedly different than before. Something had changed in my way of thinking. You see I spent a lot of time essentially being my own psychologist. Really looking deep within and being honest with myself. I came to a lot of realizations, uncovered a lot of truths, some that I didn't really want to face. 

Once one decides to change their life they must then do it. We must disassociate ourselves from weed - its no longer part of us. Focus on where you're going, not where you've been. Focus on what you're going to get not what you are currently percieving as a ""loss"". You've lost nothing, each day that goes by sober is a gain. Each day your gaining knowledge, strength and skills that you need to proceed. Some days will suck; you're going to think about weed. Of course! You've trained yourself to do that. Don't let it come as a surprise but you don't have to follow through. Its just a thought, leave it at that and move on. Think about something else.

It's easy to type words but its not easy to quit weed. It might be one of the biggest challenges many of us will overcome in our lives. Its also one of the most rewarding and it keeps on giving for as long as you decide to let it.",5,0

I’ve been toying with the idea to give up smoking weed. I’m 24 years old and I’ve been smoking since I was 13. I’ve been wanting to quit just because of how much money I waste on it, and I’m afraid of getting tested at work. 

I work in healthcare and recently went to school & actually got certified as an MA. My old job was in home health & they only did random if necessary & tbh they were mouth swabs & you’d have to drive to the office to go take it so they were easy to pass. Now I work for a large hospital system & the office I work in is inside of the hospital. The other day I witnessed my first random, they come up to you, have you sign a paper, and walk you down to the bathroom to do the drug screen which means there’s absolutely no way around it unless you literally carry synthetic urine on your person daily (which sounds like a pain in the butt.) 

Anyways, so I’m like on day 3 of being sober snd I am so bored I have no idea what to do with my time. I used to come home and smoke and it would make the night go by so fast, now it’s like the night just drags on. I literally went to bed at 7:30 last night because I was bored. Im really trying hard not to cave right now and hit up my friend to buy some bud from. Anyone have any suggestions on how to make the time go by faster, or maybe something I can do. Everything seems so boring without being high & even sleeping isn’t the greatest because I’m starting to have vivid screwed up dreams which I’ve only ever had when I’ve maybe ran out of bud before.

I am 36 now and thankfully I have girlfriend and a good job. 
But it took me many years to realise what the problem  really was. Here a few words of advice for you.

If you quit weed and replace it with videogames  nothing is going to be better.

If you quit weed and replace it with pornography, nothing is going to be better.

If you quit weed and you get your dopamine kicks from any shit or bad behaviour, nothing is going to change.

You need to come to a point where your body releases dopamine when you work torwards a goal. Thats it. 
So first and foremost you have to exercise, you have eat more healthy, you have to meet people and you have to work torwards a goal.

Anyways; I'm 25 and a heavy cannabis user, I've been using cannabis since I was 15 years of age. Problem I'm having is i've an extremely addictive personality, I stopped doing any form of ""hard"" drug, and exclusively used cannabis. I've been having a really hard time trying to quit, not even getting to quit, but hyping myself up to get to the stage of quitting, if that makes sense?   


Anyways, it's kinda ruined my life, I have such a crippling reliance on the drug now and I don't even know how I can get off it, everytime I tell myself im going to quit I place another order. I can consume up to 4g-7g a week, this can cost anything from £50 - 75£ (A week)  


I don't have the money to keep smoking but will always put myself in a bad situation, even when I shouldn't just to be able to smoke, I still somehow manage to get it one way or another. I'm wondering how do people quit, I have multiple friend who all quit cannabis consumption within the last two years which helped for me because it narrowed who I could get it off, but now it's just getting worse to the point where I genuinely know I am addicted. I don't want to check myself into a drug support group as I already feel really bad about my usage.   


I smoke cigs daily aswell, I'm basically asking people do they have any good advice on how to quit smoking entirely, I have very little will power but I do want off cannabis as it's destroyed my relationships and myself. I try going to the gym but without cannabis I lack motivation to even do anything, I don't know what I'm expecting really but I'd love to hear of peoples stories of quitting and how they done it, if I could quit cigs and cannabis, i'd be more than happy but it's trying to bring myself to do it, I feel like if I don't smoke cannabis I smoke more cigs, it's just a constant vicious cycle and really feel like I need help and don't even know where to begin...",8,0

easier said than done but I’m trying. Much like how quitting has been. 

I quit for a month back in May / June, shortly before starting therapy. I made it a month and then had a really bad day and smoked, thinking it would be different, I was doing better and started therapy so maybe it wouldn’t have such a hold over me this time?

That led to me smoking daily again. My partner smokes too and said she feels like I’m happier when I’m smoking. Duh. She only got the high version of me when I was smoking but the rest of the time I’m miserable - I work as a nurse so can’t smoke and go to work and I’m tired of needing weed to function outside of work. I have remembered her saying that though and felt like I needed to smoke to be a good partner, which writing out and being further in the quitting process, I can see is distorted thinking. 

A couple weeks ago I quit again and was doing quite a bit better within a week but again - this Saturday had a bad morning, and ended up smoking again which was a daily thing until 2 days ago. I didn’t smoke yesterday and I feel more determined than ever but worry about my future self. I started going to a depression/anxiety support group a few weeks ago and they’re great so hoping the accountability of that helps make this quit be the last one. I’ve I walk a lot daily between work and waking to get to places in the city, I go on runs, eat pretty healthy, have utilized grounding techniques in the past and done journaling consistently for periods and inconsistently at others and do meditation when I quit even though it feels like a chore. It feels like I’m doing all the right things but just can’t do what really matters - stopping once and for all. I know deep down I can and I really want to, (the last relapse I didn’t even enjoy but smoked to make sure I could sleep before a busy day at work) but I do have that fear that I’ll cave down the line. 

Any advice?

But when your mom starts yelling at you every week for not doing the dishes and tells you to stop smoking weed, you tell her ""You don't understand mom! Weed is great and it gives me tons of motivation!"" Maybe you'll get tons of motivation, ideas, and fantastic propositions within 30 minutes of getting high, but once those initial chemicals metabolize into different chemicals and you start lacking that initial THC boost, Sativa or Indica, you'll become a couch potato wanting to watch youtube and eat a bag of chips. Or if you live in a city, spend 30 dollars on Uber Eats. The more weed you smoke the heavier you'll feel as your brain is rotting from the lack of chemicals you provided it from the initial high. Your whole day or evening is going to be a burnout. I've smoked weed thousands of times, fluctuating from ""This stuff is amazing!"" to ""I'm having the worst time of my life right now, I'm super uncomfortable and anxious, why did I do this in the first place"".

Even if you're not living with your parents currently, I am young and I can afford to be staying at my parent's place, but not forever, not even within the next 2 years. But anyone, at any age, if you have a goal, a project, or a business you want to achieve, hell, even learning a new hobby, you need to approach it sober. The amount of focus and dedication you need to suffice through the struggle life inevitably challenges you through any subject, don't have the quitter mentality. Smoking weed won't necessarily give you this ""quitter mentality"", but I can tell you from experience, it will make whatever you want to achieve much more harder, because eventually, you'll be out of focus, distracted, and wanting to smoke more weed. 

When you stop smoking weed as compensation for making your life better, quitting smoking cannabis is not just the solution. Yes, it is the first step, but every day after should be setting goals for yourself on what you want to achieve THAT DAY. Wake up early. Do the most important thing first within the first couple of hours of waking up. Finish the work that has to be done. Then set time for yourself for self-improvement, whether it be working out, learning something necessary for the success in your life. Continuously working on that something necessary. Come up with philosophies, creative thinking, and solutions for your problems. The evening will come around for relaxing. Do something fun. 

Secure and harden the personality that you have, not the daydreams from smoking weed of who you want to be.

You can do it, whoever is reading this. If you are here just after quitting smoking weed, have quit smoking weed for a while, or laughing at this subreddit after you've gotten high thinking to yourself ""this will never be me! weed is great for me!"" like I once did, just keep in mind that there will come a time where the success of your life will depend on the decision whether of getting high or not. Not every decision should be done while high. And the paradox of success of, ""will I be more successful if I smoked weed and did \[this, whatever it may be\] compared to doing it sober?"" I can tell you that your sober self, no matter how clumsy it may be, is clear and confident. Focus, achieve what you need to achieve, and be thankful that you achieved it with a sober mindset.

You got this. Keep on going with your momentum!

While I don’t think it’s forever, I did find through research that I was experiencing symptoms of Cannabis Use Disorder. It started out as a substitute for alcohol (my stomach gets irritated when food and booze mix together and I would get sick when I overdid it) and became a mild addition/bad habit. I’d like to share my story, gain support and support others as I detox over the next few months. 

Background:

I’m 30, and had been smoking everyday since 2016- 5 years now. I had a brief 6 week purge between years 2-3 for a job change. It started with 1-2 bowls 1-2 times a week, but with time and the pandemic, I’ve progressed to 2-3 or more bowls each night, along with vaping. I even began overdoing it on weekends, waking and baking and needing it to feel good in general.

Negative Effects:

1. I developed a reputation among my friends for being a big stoner (we all were but they even voted me the biggest one during our kickball season superlatives): this lead to lack of respect and not being taken seriously

2. It altered my concept of time - making it go by too fast especially on weekends.

3. It gave me memory loss

4. My moods were fluctuating and made me go down rabbit holes and emotional breakdowns triggered by past trauma and work stress.

5. It made it more difficult for me to develop healthier and self-improving habits. I would become lazy and a couch potato

6. I would have trouble focusing during regular conversations.

7. I started getting anxiety before work and difficult tasks, causing procrastination which made the anxiety worse

Ideally I’d like detox and make it a social habit instead of an addiction. 

Last Updated: Day 34

Week 1:

Negatives: cravings for first 3 days, and trouble sleeping every night.

Positives: cravings subsided after 3 days (I got rid of my tools and stash to remove the temptation) my mood seemed to be more stable

Week 2: 

Negatives: sleep is spotty-tosses/turns with night sweats. Not every night. 

Positives: I can focus better during work meetings, and I’m having dreams here and there. No cravings or urges despite stressful work environment. I’m also able to hangout with some friends who smoke, they offered out of habit, but I’m finding enough self control to decline.

Week 3:

Negatives: Sleep quality is not the best, still get some mood swings (mostly due to external stress- I suspect)

Positives: I was able to dream at least a little bit last night without any sleep aids! I worked myself out of bad mood swing yesterday without a full on breakdown. Keeping my hopes up while feeling good! My airway seems less obstructed/phlegmy. I can breathe through my nose much easier and I don’t cough up phlegm every morning.

Week 4:

Negatives: not 100% back to sleeping normal

Positives: I’m starting to sleep longer at night. The insomnia seems to be wearing off. My airways seems much clearer. 

Week 5:

I can sleep 5-6 hours straight now. I do recognize that I need to exercise more. But I’m feeling much more energized and ready to do things!",16,1

I started smoking when I was 15 (30 now) and very quickly became an every day, multiple times sort of thing. I’ve stopped twice over the past 5 years or so, mainly because I stopped dating the person who I had the connections through (before it was legal here). 

Now that it’s easily available, and my live in partner also smokes with no interest in stopping, I don’t know how to get through the first couple days without smoking…

Overall, he says he’s supportive of me quitting, especially since I’ve started getting extremely sick quite often from smoking, but he doesn’t make an effort to change any habits or not smoke in my house (he moved in with me). 

I know I need to quit, for my overall health and just to feel better and more in control of my life, I just don’t know how to make the decision finally and stick with it, I usually only last a day before something stresses me out.",2,0

Please remember to be patient and do not beat yourself up. It doesn't just take a few days  for your brain to equalize. It takes months, 3-6 months or more. Longer for some people. It's not just about not being high, or letting the thc leave your body. It's also about letting your brain start to begin to  make the dopamine/seratonin it stopped making on its own AND repairing the neural  receptors that were altered by the brain activity caused by chronic use.  NOT ONLY THAT but you also need to learn to manage the social and  emotional nuances that come with sobriety. That takes serious time and  practice, it doesn't come fast or easy.

I'm sure for some people, quitting helps them feel better fast. But for  most of us, that is not the case. This is not just my opinion, it's based on loads of literature I've read. It's also been true to my own experience.  I smoked daily for 17 years and quit almost 9 months ago. I felt worse  and thought it wasn't worth it for 2-3 months. Then for another 3 months, I  was up and down. Just in the last couple months have I seen a massive shift in my mood and productivity. It took a lot longer than I hoped,  but it's really made a difference. 

Hang in there, and don't beat yourself up. Especially if you're smoked for a long ass time (but even if you haven't). ",245,0

Thank you everyone for the daily support and for sharing your stories. It has really helped me get to day 12, which is the furthest I have gone in years. 

I decided to quit smoking so I could deal with getting broken up with. I wasnt facing my problems and masking them with the marijuana. For the past 5-6 years I have been smoking almost an 1/8th of weed mixed with tobacco out of my bong daily. Ive tried quitting many times in the past but have never been successful, the withdrawals were always too much for me. This time is different though, I am very motivated to quit.

The first week was rough, although I have been doing all I can to better myself - gym each day, meditating, cold showers, eating healthier, etc. I still had all the withdrawals. The past few days I have noticed my appetite has come back, and I am falling asleep easier and for longer amounts of time which is great.  But I have also felt so extremely fatigued throughout the day. Im not sure why as I wasn't having this withdrawal the first week, but it has hit me hard the last few days. I havnt had any energy to get up and go do stuff like I did the first week. I know my dopamine is low, and part of it is mental too. I feel like I am starting to heal and my body wants to recover from not being able to sleep more than 5 hours a night the past few months due to the breakup.

Has anyone else felt a similar experience around the 12 day mark? I saw a lot of people post that the 2nd week was really hard for them. Any advise on getting past this fatigue? I really appreciate you all!",2,1

I was hoping that my desire to do things would increase, but as I stepped back from smoking three weeks ago all I saw was my partner and in-laws staring mindlessly at their TV and phones. I can't help but feel like smoking actually motivated to do MORE things, most of the time.

Additionally, I'm left with this emptiness inside of me where my habits used to live. I have been trying to fill them with walking, pokemon go, D&D, cooking and movies - I'm even working on a play script, but nothing seems to bring much joy anymore. I'm just ""living"", but I don't see the point of it. 

I quit because my partner hated it. We made a deal that I quit and she doesn't leave my anxious-depressed ass, and she goes to therapy for her own depression. However, she is dragging the chain on her end and now I'm feeling a little spiteful about the whole thing.

I know smoking again can mess up my life. I know it made me unmotivated and miserable (but nowhere near as much as the booze did). I know it is supposed to get easier, but I just want to feel 'not empty'.

654,2021-08-19 07:22:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p7cwjt/90_days/,90 days,"Hi there, I’ve been in this subreddit for a while but mostly in the background. 

I’ve just hit 90 days and this is the longest I’ve ever been sober since I started messing around with weed about 6 years ago. The longest I’ve gone before was about 6 weeks. 

Around June of last year I had hit a pretty serious wall where I was getting high at work for a pretty consistent period of time. Probably a few months, it’s a giant blur now. But I would have moments where I would be obviously high, and I would just keep repeating to myself if you get caught for this, you deserve it. That’s how bad it had gotten.

And so around June 18th, I was working a new job and I decided the getting high at work had to die with the old job. And i had to start taking getting sober seriously. I had put these goal posts of “ill stop getting high after university.” Or “I’ll leave it when I turn 26.” And etc. But I wasn’t really able to stop it that day. 

And so in June I tried to seriously get sober, lasted about 6 weeks before life stress came back and I caved. And I would cave for a minute, try to get back on the horse and then fall off again and let it go for a while. And I kept telling people I was serious this time and fall off the horse again. 

And honestly, it got the point where it was so shameful and embarrassing to tell people I had a problem and then be high on their couch the next week. But it took that process of knowing it was bad, telling people it was bad, and then falling into the trap to truly say enough was enough. 

And in the end for me, it was that the highs often made my horrible mental health even worse. It was catapult the dark ugly feelings into spirals that truly made me distressed. And my therapist for many years said the drugs are not helping you, you have to get sober. And so it became the only thing I hadn’t tried. 

The first 28 days were hard. But i just kept making the goal making it to midnight, and then doing it again, and again until suddenly I didn’t need to keep it as a goal to make it midnight. And then I stopped thinking about it all together for that day or a couple of days. It does come back and I’ll resume the midnight goal. 

Even these last few days I struggled with thinking about it, but I wanted the 90 day marker so bad. I can’t imagine starting from day one again. 

I guess, this long ass essay, is to really say it took me almost an entire year of trying to get sober and falling off the horse to truly take it seriously. And that entire year was so important because I never did get high at work again, and suddenly getting high and drunk felt shameful and ugly and wrong and I had to keep asking myself if this was helping or putting down a worse path. 

And I’m proud of each and every day that lead me to my 90 day mark. I already feel like a whole different adult. I’m excited to see what happens the longer I go.

Thank you all for sharing your inspiring stories, you have all motivated me to try again to better myself.

Let’s go back to the start.

I was introduced to weed in primary school by a friend, it was just a bit of a rebellious stage, it didn’t really catch on to me as something I would do everyday until many many years later.

Fast forward to 2014, I’m 28 years old I have a home, a job a wife a child, things were going ok. My cousin and my wife then decided to have an affair behind my back. I left my home and moved back in with my parents, fast forward 3 months. I am coping but barely, I walk into work on a Sunday morning and my co-worker shoots himself in the head right next to me. I watched the life leave his eyes, I held him until help arrived, I was numb and covered in blood, brain matter and cerebral fluid.

About 2 weeks later, I got some weed. It helped me continue moving forward after these tragic events. I was grateful for this lovely herb to take away my pain, anxiety and PTSD. I was smoking daily but also mixing in alcohol on the weekends, after spiralling out of control for several months I put myself into a mental health facility for help. I was medicated and had several bouts of ECT. I was off weed and again somewhat stable. 

A few months later I was at Maccas and met my now wife, we hit it off, we enjoy similar things … she likes wrestling !!!! I move in with her, I start a new career in finance we have a baby, but a house and we are chipping away at life together…

Life was getting a bit crazy in 2019 - buying our house, work and we found out our son is Autistic - at first it was a 50 a week, then a quarter, then a half and then an ounce a week. I was spiraling again …

Then 2020 . Covid -19 . Uncertainty, lockdowns, stress, pay cuts,wife loses Job.. instead of quitting and helping and being positive I continued down the sleepy road, now I’m here 2021 have smoked non stop everyday for the past 2 years almost, it needs to end.

So here I am 3 days in, I’m sweating, I’m shitting like crazy, feel constantly sick and have 0 appetite, I know it is just the withdrawals, the body craving what it’s use to… but not anymore! I won’t give in, I won’t crumble … I hope 🤞 

Thankyou for reading my story 🙏",1,2

I threw out all my paraphernalia that morning and made a conscious effort to ignore the urge to casually turn into the driveway of the dispensary. 

Last night while we were climbing, my buddy invited me to hang out today and told me he and his cousin were having a smoke sesh. While climbing I mentioned that I’d quit, and then later as we were leaving, I told him “maybe I’ll take a hit or two, if you’re smoking a joint”. He was gonna hit a pen, and that’s a major red flag for me. The ease and accessibility of vapes was a huge factor in my addiction, and it makes me nervous to think about trying a weed vape again. But I left the gym that night thinking “eh, what’s the worst one hit could do?”

Well, this morning I woke up thinking about it and I had a loud and crystal-clear gut feeling that I *should not hit that vape*. I’ve learned recently to trust my gut on everything. Anytime I’ve ignored the gut feeling, I’ve regretted it, so I wasn’t gonna ignore it this time. 

Fast forward to 9pm-ish, we’re all hanging out, I’ve got some beers and they offer me the vape (my friend and his cousin are both already high). Guys, wouldn’t you believe it, I said no! I even held the thing in my hand to look at it and then handed it back without putting it even close to my mouth. The temptation was there but not as strong as I’d expected, and even easier to ignore.

I've been smoking weed everyday for the last 2 to 3 years, I honestly can't remember, this part of my life is just a blur in my head. My recently beaten alcohol addiction didn't help with memory.

Anyway, I really want to quit. I know it's bad for me, I've fucked relationship and opportunities up because I preferred staying at home to smoke, it made me a lazy piece of shit. I have issues which make me generally unhappy with my life, and I feel like weed made me push these problems away, only for them to come back flying up in my face. I'll soon go to a therapist for this, but that's not the point.

I feel like it's impossible to take the first step to quit, it's always so easy to just roll a joint and waste a few hours away, I basically go to sleep everyday hating myself for how high I get, only to wake up at 4 in the afternoon and do it again.

I've recently been more open about these issues to people I love, and I feel like I'm at a point in my life where I have to quit, or else I'll be fucked forever. I know I have support, I have everything I need, I just need to fucking do it.

Would you recommend quitting everything cold turkey, or maybe slow down little by little ? Knowing me I feel like I wouldn't have the mental fortitude to do the later, but what do you think anyway ?

I've been smoking since I was 16, I'm 33 now. When I first started and for years after, weed almost felt like a stimulant to me. I would become more talkative and sociable, funnier, wittier, way more creative, I honestly felt a lot smarter high. A few years ago that began to fade. Smoking would make me feel slow to respond during conversations, I never knew what to say and if I forced myself to just say whatever was in my head it was weird. I was too foggy to comprehend what people were talking about. I felt awkward and uncomfortable especially around new people. But I didn't quit I just became more isolated. 

It did aid in my creativity and during my 20's I was trying to ""make it"" as a musician and felt smoking would actually increase my odds of doing that due to the creative boost. Eventually I ran out of money and was sick of working shitty jobs just to get by so started learning to code. Weed felt like the only way I could truly sit down and lose myself in code for hours without getting bored or tired of it, whenever I'd start to feel myself reaching a mental limit I'd just smoke another bowl and it was like a complete reset, I could code for hours this way and felt like I was learning a lot. And I think I was, I have a great career as a software engineer now. But I've lost so much. 

I can barely hold a conversation with someone these days. Get so self conscious which leads to anxiety which leads to me wanting to exit the conversation asap. I feel like I make ""weird"" eye contact now and have a hard time looking people in the eye. I haven't been on a date in like 5 years, I just sit alone in my apartment all the time. I recently moved to Denver from Austin and wow did it get worse. All the legal access led to me smoking 3+ grams a day, and moving to a new city, during COVID, I'm lonelier than ever. My only reprieve is smoking but I can't keep living this way, so I quit. I've taken tolerance breaks for like a week before but this is the first time I'm intentionally quitting. I just feel like I've lost so much of my personality, my confidence, sense of self, etc. Will it ever come back? I used to be really fun and I dated a lot and I don't think it was just because I was young and a musician. I can't place exactly what I'm missing but I know it's gone, or at least dormant. My work has also suffered, it's hard to me to spend more than 30 minutes on a problem without getting distracted or overwhelmed. I just started a new job too and need to perform. The timing of all this couldn't be worse.

Anyone felt themselves in a similar hole after over half a lifetime of smoking and were able to climb out of it after quitting? I know I'm only 8 days in but right now it feels kind of hopeless.",39,1

I am now 53. 
Early on I would regularly take tolerance breaks for 3 -7 months every year. With irritability and cravings the only w/d symptoms. But, I haven’t gone more than a few weeks sober for the past 15 years. 
I noticed I have been getting anxiety whenever I would smoke lately. (Due in no small part to the high THC weed now available)Not terrible but considering I got high daily, it was a nuisance. So, I decided to take a break from weed. 
The first 10 days were pretty easy aside from being a bit more crabby than usual. Didn’t crave or want weed at all. 
Then shit got real and my body and mind let me know they weren’t happy with my decision to stop smoking weed. 
Soul crushing anxiety was now a constant companion. I would catastrophize everything. Doom and gloom were constant. Sleep became almost non existent. When I did sleep I would awaken shortly after in a panic attack with my ears ringing loudly. Night sweats. No appetite. Digestive issues. Tremors. BRAIN FOG! Not able to concentrate. Had to quit coffee because of extreme jitters. My morning bowel movement which ran like a German train schedule was now scattershot at best. 
I did find exercise to be very beneficial. My body was used to pumping out adrenaline trying make up for the weed consumption. Now being weed free and anxiety ridden adrenaline was plentiful. Exercising helped burn that off allowing me to calm down and sleep. 
I thought of smoking weed. Not because I wanted to but, I thought it would make all these things go away. Luckily, I realized it wouldn’t and would probably cause even greater anxiety. 
After about 3 weeks of feeling like absolute shit I started to feel better. Slowly. Days which were filled with anxiety with small snippets of normalcy now have flipped. Mostly feeling normal with small snippets of anxiety and other w/d symptoms. 
In hindsight, I was naive to think that quitting would be easy. I had been smoking for many years. 
I was also foolish to work off of others withdrawal timeline. Everybody is different and we have to go thru this at our own pace and take things as they come. 
I am at day 54 and am feeling pretty good. Not perfect. Not even great. But, today was much better than 3 weeks ago. I have hope that tomorrow will be better than today. 
I have used marijuana for many years and my brain and body were so used to working off of that as being normal. It is still a healing process and will take some time. I am not only ok with that but excited.",180,0

I had two best buddies that also smoked w me.  We used to be idiots in college.  They both havent gone much in life while I worked my way to a high paying job.  I reconnected with them in april 2020 for the lockdown and throughout the next several months of daily smoking I realized they were more/less exactly the same from college and felt they leeched food and resources ( for granted) off my Income.

But the main reason I quit was not by choice, rather because I started feeling like my throat was swollen (especially after smoking) causing me anxiety and discomfort to the point it’s been difficult falling asleep.

And as of Monday (today’s Wednesday) I’ve been sober for three whole days and completely hating life!!

I don’t remember the last time I experienced headaches that were so strong it makes me feel unsteady. It’s disheartening especially because I didn’t really choose to quit, I felt like I had to stop so I could figure out if my throat feeling weird is connected to smoking at all. I’m struggling so much and can’t talk to anyone I know in real life because I feel kind of embarrassed that it’s really my own fault that i’ve abused weed to the point where I’m experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

 My mental health seriously declined afterwards and I was essentially stuck in some sort of limbo until I turned 19 and found weed again and HOLY FUCK I loved it. Love at first sight type shit.
At that time I thought weed was my savior, my salvation to all of my problems....damn was I dead wrong, I feel stupid now for having that mindset back then.

I made a new account for this so my friends, family, and co-workers don't start snooping in my biz. Background on me is I've been a daily (sometimes hourly) smoker for over 12 years. I've gotten on and off the wagon numerous times.

Recently spoke with someone who was an addiction counselor. He didn't know I was an addict (no one there did), we just happened to meet in a group social setting and he started talking about his job. He said a phrase at one point about how when you are talking to someone who is in the throes of addiction, oftentimes you're really just ""talking to the drug.""

That really stuck with me. When I'm stoned I no longer recognize who I am. It's almost like I'm the drug, or the drug is this face-hugging alien smothering my mouth. The last time I quit was last year around the start of Covid. Held on for almost three months before meeting up with the green again. Ever since I re-started smoking it's been nearly constant. To the point that I can feel how slow my brain gets when I've taken a bunch of hits and try to hold a normal conversation.

I'm in my late thirties, super depressed, no money, poor health, and I want to turn things around. I want to start a family, earn a better income, have less anxiety, less depression, and better physical health. These things will only happen if I take action. No one else can do it for me. Yes, others can help, I have been seeing a therapist for the past year which has helped a lot, but in the dark of night when I'm wrestling with my demons it's only me. There are plenty of things in my life that I need to work on and fix but none of those are going to succeed if I can't get this damn, delicious plant off my back and out of my lungs.

I don't have anyone else in my life to talk to about this to besides my therapist, so reading this subreddit has been really helpful, which is why I'm moving from lurker to poster. My guess is tonight is going to be really tough so you can bet I'll be reading posts to help me get through it.

I have had an incredibly stressful week so far working on pretty complex issues in a corporate environment.  In the past, when something stressful came up, something didnt go the way i was expecting, i would have a total mental breakdown and wouldnt be able to deal with it.  

Since i stopped toking daily (i have had slip ups here and there), i am much better at being able to take moments like this one moment at a time and actually deal with it. It's not always fun to not have a release from the stress after work, but its worth it 100%.",2,0

Some of you may remember seeing my name. I documented a 2+ year sobriety journey from 2019-2021. My last post was a circle back to the community after a relapse. I was 1 month sober (7months ago). My last post was one of extremely positive mindset, I was READY to hit life hard again (sober). I posted my update and went to bed….

I was awakened by screams from my sister; my deepest darkest fear came true. My mother passed away in the middle of the night, unexpectedly. My world, shattered. 

I stayed sober for roughly 2 months after this fateful night but then I caved. I’ve been smoking ever since April. HEAVILY too. High concentrate dab pens/dab rigs. Burning 8ths like I was 18 again… (I just turned 30). I’m at the lowest spot of my life. My depression and anxiety are at an all time high, my health, crumbling, I’m still employed but easily becoming overwhelmed and useless. Physical Health, declining. Mental health absolutely destroyed. Relationships with others = barely existent. I am just quite literally at the lowest spot of my life. A shell of my former self.

Here I am again, dab pen in hand like a crack head, ripping this pen until 2am when my eyes bleed. Waking up for work like a straight up space cadet. 

I realize I’m trying to do everything I can to escape the harshness of my situation by smoking weed every second of every day. 
I just can’t believe I’m here, yet again. I don’t know when I’ll get my shit together. At this point it feels like never. 

I’m glad I kept this account around. Your previous comments, love and support mean more to me now than they did within the last 2 years. I hope to circle back to this community again with better news in the future.

Need Advice,"Quitting weed is something I never intended or expected I’d be doing. For the longest time I perceived cannabis as a miracle plant that can help with everything from anxiety to insomnia. Don’t get me wrong, it does provide some wonderful benefits and can be a much safer alternative to other medications, but I recently got to the point where not only was I not getting the same affects anymore but I was beginning to feel like weed controlled me.

I started off smoking in high school because I didn’t have too many friends yet the stoner crowd had no problem welcoming me with open arms. I usually would just smoke on weekends, yet it progressively turned into a daily habit. By my senior year of high school I was smoking daily, a lot of the times before school even started, as I felt it helped me “get through my day.” 

Once I began college, I turned the notch even more and become and ultra stoner. At this point I was exclusively smoking concentrates daily because I was going through flower extremely quickly. Weed became part of my identity and I was often known for being a stoner or being high at various functions. 

Fast forward, I’m out of college and was lucky enough to secure a job that Iike. When the job first started, I told myself no smoking in the morning since it would take away any motivation I had for that day. I soon realized I couldn’t smoke during work at all because it was affecting my performance. 

I thought this would be an easy rule to follow, but boy was I wrong. I found myself thinking/wanting weed consistently during my shifts and I wasn’t taking in valuable information from my boss. 

This Monday, when my boss mentioned we didn’t have to interact with clients, what did I do? I packed myself a few bowls and got super stoned during work, causing me to feel anxious, regretful and angry. 

After that, I decided to flush all the weed I had left and break a majority of my paraphernalia. It truly was one of the harder things I’ve done. It was like saying goodbye to a friend that’s always had your back over the years, as corny as that may sound. 

It’s only been 31 hours since I last smoked, and I’m feeling terrible. I’m irritable and cursing out loved ones, I can’t sleep, eat, and even my focus at work is bad because all I can think about is how weed would make everything better. 

A large portion of me wants to say Fuck it, go pick up some oil and taper rather than cold turkey it, but I’m afraid I won’t actually taper and my habit will be the same. 

I know it gets better, but when? I have a birthday gathering coming up Friday, yet I’m worried I’m going to be a dick and not be fun to be around. 


Any advice? Should I get some and instead begin the quitting process after my birthday gathering to ensure I have a good time? Or do I stick with this and just hope it gets better sooner than later?

I feel instinctively this post hits the nail on the head ......



What I hate so much about weed is how it creeps up on people. There is no real hangover with the drug so you dont get your immediate feedback. The haze of complacency is what makes it so terrible, it causes you to make bad decisions and helps you avoid problems which leads them to pile up over time. It is such a procastinator drug, you get nothing really productive done while on it or at best you halfass those things, some chore is always postponed and this leads to an overall deterioration of  getting your house and life in order. After years of cannabis use many people find themselves in a position where their life is kinda shitty, they didnt achieve those goals they set for themselves and they are deeply unsatisfied unless they are currently high and can smoke away those bad feels. They find themselves in a rut that they will never be able to get out of unless they stop smoking weed. This is where the kicker comes; due to the creeping and slow motion effect weed has on your life many people never reach the realization that it is in large part their weed consumption over long periods of time that have lead them to this shitty part of their life which ends in depression or just general dissatisfaction. It becomes really hard to pinpoint the reason of where it went wrong, it was just a hundred thousand small bad decisions which were heavily influenced by weed that get people to where they dont wanna be and they cant lay that problem at the feet of weed because they dont realize how smoking pot is linked to all of this.",871,0

She said her health is compromised and she can't take good care of herself while I'm here with her.  Said I'm too erratic and manic for her (I went looking for a new car).  So she needs me out of the picture in order for her to feel calm enough to take care of herself.  


I said ok that's fine I will look for a place I understand.  I think it is for the best.  Later on Sunday I start looking for a place while my 2 kids are around and it turns into a shit show- daughter says hey this is moving too fast you are overreacting dad!  I say well I don't think so based on what your mom told me. 

Then on Monday wife and daughter basically say hey don't move so fast.   Wife says maybe I said a few things in the heat of the moment that I didn't fully mean, can't we all just chill for a while.  Oh and don't you dare smoke any weed.  And dad if you leave this house now I will never speak to you again (daughter is 22 yo).  Wow!  


Backstory is zero intimacy with wife for the last 3 years and she's fine with that and thinks I should be also given that she has some health issues. I get it but I feel completely rejected honestly.  It's not just the health issues. 

I was sober for 5 months until yesterday and also sober 7 months in 2020.  

I can't take this turmoil.  Get out!  No I mean stay, but behave the way I want you to!  No I mean get out!  What do I believe?  

I'm resolved that I will be leaving.  But I agreed to take it more slowly for the next week or two while the dust settles on this.

Wife and daughter are very co-dependent at this point but they don't think they need any help for this. Obviously I can't tell them this they won't listen because I'm the ""addict"".

But something strange has happened to my menstrual cycle, during the past 45-50 days I’ve had my period every 2 weeks and I’m always on time and nothing else hasn’t changed in my lifestyle so I guess quitting weed might be the cause. 

I’ve checked with my gynecologist 2 weeks ago and she took some tests and a sonogram, looks like my progesterone level has dropped remarkably which is causing me to miss ovulations. She said this is a rare thing for people my age. It’s not a dangerous situation and it’s gonna be okay in 6 months but it’s so strange for me. 

At that time I thought maybe being in a stressful situation (and the fact that I’m moving to another country in a few weeks) caused it and tbh I couldn’t tell her about weed since I live in a very conservative judgmental country. I also have been diagnosed to be highly sensitive (both physically and mentally) so experiencing rare side effects happens to me. Maybe hormonal changes aren’t common in people who quit weed either. 

So, people who menstruate, has anybody experienced any changes? Missing ovulation or delayed periods after quitting?",3,0

I am 25 years old and usually only a reddit lurker. Earlier this year I wrote a list with things I wanted to change before the end of 2021 and to stop smoking was one of them. I am a student, who like a lot of you guys has been living his life on autopilot. Last week I smoked my last bud an quit cold turkey.

The first 2 nights, I had a restless sleep and was sweating quite a bit. Yesterday I met up with my stoner friends and told them that I am on a THC break. It was hard to not smoke with them but I managed. 
Today is the 7th day smokefree and I did not sleep very well. The Weather is shitty and so is my mood. I could not be productive today, since my mind is racing right now. I have a crush on my best friend and I am to scared to tell her about my feelings because I am scared of beeing rejected and losing the friendship. This is however now affecting me very much and usually I would smoke those feelings away. Additionally the news about afghanistan and the news about the climate change coming quicker than anticipated is having a toll on me. I feel like I have to work through a lot of emotions.

  
Right now I lay in my bed and I am too paralysed to do anything. I dont often talk about my emotions so I dont know who to talk to and I decided to write this post to hopefully work through some of this. This sub has really inspired me and I read through your stories daily. 
I think I am on the right track but I've hit like a mountain I need to conquer right now.

So i quit about a month and a half ago and i feel so good. Im turning 21 in two days and started smoking when i was 16 years old. I have been smoking daily since then and i just now realize how much it has kept me from doing what i love. It made me paranoid and anxious and it made me so careless, i didnt pursue my education ect. I just didn't care about anything. Now i love the relationship i have with my family, i go out to cafe's almost every day for a cup of coffee in the city to chill and draw or just vibe, i feel like i have more time, i have energy AND the best of all, i sleep amazing. I dream weird but fun shit every night and i legit feel like im processing my days better. Im clear in my mind and my dreams for my future are coming back. I feel motivated to go back to school and do an apprenticeship with animals. Im still sick of humans but i enjoy the time I spend with myself so much, I dont overthink everything as much ect...

I honestly wish you all the best and I hope you will have the strength and motivation to quit smoking addictively like I did. Its amazing. (no judgement tho to everyone that decides to keep on blazing)

Weed withdrawal of course but also running on lack of sleep, tired of everyone's bullshit of disregarding me and my feelings because I'm ""different"", tension between my family and on top of that announced that we were going into lockdown all in the same day.

I was sitting there watching the news when the lockdown was announced with the arguing of my parents in the background, and my breathing went crazy fast. I completely lost control of my breathing and I started tearing up. All of the times I had been treated like shit by others, along with everything else going through my mind, it was too much and I grabbed a paper bag and some water and ran into the forest, balling my eyes out and letting out all of my built up rage, darkness and sadness. My vision was blurry, head spinning, heart was beating fast and I wouldn't stop crying my eyes out because I just let it all out. I even screamed at the top of my lungs out into the open to let out even more of my anger out. 

I'm just physically and mentally exhausted, and I'm also taking a break from all my social media as I just feel overwhelmed and need to find ways to get myself better over the course of this lockdown.

Mine might be:

\- Escapism from real responsibilities.

\- 'Hanging onto' youth through childish habits.

\- Long-term identification with being a stoner.

\- Using it as relaxing 'me time' after a work shift.

I'm sure the list could go on. Considering how we carry on smoking despite knowing that we should quit, the reasons we give ourselves must be quite significant, even though they seem trivial on paper.

I just graduated college in May, and I really upped my weed consumption my senior year as well as this summer. Covid and online classes were really bad for me. I was getting high in the morning till right before bed. I definitely smoked more daily than the rest of the 4 years. 
Im one week clean now, and I want to stick with it. I feel like it’s time to start my life, not just live in a haze and a constant cycle of “when can I get hihu again.” Im just having a really hard time because though most of my usage was recreational, I did use it at least once a week medically for my chronic headaches. I’ve been to all the doctors, and nothing seems to cure them except for weed.
Today I had a headache that lasted the entire day, and I was miserable. I knew if I were to go pick up some weed, it’d be gone in less than 10 minutes. I was able to tough it out today, but I’m worried if my headaches continue I’ll cave and turn to the flower again. 
I finally am starting to feel like myself again. I love the feeling of being sober and clean.

 This is my third bout at quitting over the last year. First one lasting for 4 months, second for 2 months, this one is a few days away from three weeks. 

One of my motivations for quitting is that my love of extreme sports has been crushed by weed. I spent many years loving skateboarding, wakeboarding, snowboarding, surfing, motocross, gymnastics, and really anything that got my adrenaline going. I spent years building these skills and poured dedication in. 

However, I spent the last 10 years smoking daily. Slowly but surely the toll took its effect. I cannot function at a high level and my brain will not enter ""the zone"" required for the precision involved when I'm smoking. Even though I usually did not smoke during the day, only at night before bed it would still have its hold the next day and that hold got worse and worse over the years as I started needing more and more weed to sleep. This combined with lack of motivation to stay in regular shape lead to injuries and performance decline in all of these sports which lead to more demotivation. 

That lead to me just cutting them out of my life completely, blaming it on ""me getting too old."" Well that's a fucking bullshit excuse. I'm only in my late twenties, and although I AM getting older, it doesn't mean I cannot still do these sports and even the ones that I've always dreamt of but never had the opportunity or resources to do like: kiteboarding, windsurfing, wingsuiting, street bike racing. Hell, there are OLYMPIANS older than me. 

Anyway, like I said I'm three weeks into another go and I just moved back to my home town which is about 45 minutes from a beach. This beach doesn't get great waves but there are a few tropical storms off the coast right now and the report said there would be some surf so I said what the heck I'll pull my boards out and go get a little wet on the small waves. 

Mind you, I've been dealing with some serious insomnia and focus issues. The insomnia is the worst part about quitting for me and it inevitably leads to focus issues and in general it spikes my adhd issues and leads to worse moods and just sucks. It causes me to make a lot of small mistakes I wouldn't normally make. 

So I got to the beach, walked out, and checked the waves. They were smaller than the report said and were going to be too small for the boards I own since I don't currently have a longboard than can handle 2-3 ft swell. Pathetic, I know but it can still be fun with the right type of board and paddling around is great exercise. So I decided I would go rent a surfboard from a local shop and continue with my plan. Mind you, I'm on a tight budget currently and it allowed just enough for the unplanned $50 rental fee.

When I walked back to my truck from the beach to drive to the surf shop, I realized that I didn't have my keys in my pocket, only my phone... my dumbass locked my keys in the truck... FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS WEEK. I haven't locked my keys in the car in like 5 years, even while smoking. Thankfully I had my phone so I could call a locksmith to come. $70 for the locksmith to come out. That meant the rental wasn't going to be able to fit into the budget. This entire situation sent me into one of those mood changes and into a huge state of depression and self loathing full of calling myself a dumbass and being pissed that I don't even have a big enough budget for a sport I love doing and a bunch of other terrible thpughts.

I had to wait an hour on the locksmith and tumbled deeper as the time went on. So I just drove all the way back home after getting my truck open and crawled in bed. I never really got to sleep but the bed remedy kinda worked. Although I'm still in general depressed and annoyed and I'm definitely not happy with how the day went or how my brain and body reacted. I am not in the deep hole anymore for now which is why I'm sharing. 

So that's just one of my experiences you guys. Dealing with this shit one day at a time. It gets better and the mood changes won't be forever. 

Have a good one and stay strong, as I start fucking tearing up for no reason writing this send off sentence.",21,0

768,2021-08-16 23:43:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p5w1t1/this_sucks/,This sucks,"Hi, I recently decided to quit smoking weed. I decided this because I realized that I was not enjoying my life unless I was high as a kite. I read the top posts on this subreddit and it was just so clear that I have an addiction just like everyone else here. I don’t want to wake up in 20 years and realize that I spent my life in an unfulfilling haze.

I “quit” a week ago, but relapsed for 3 days because I wouldn’t eat and I couldn’t sleep. I had thrown away my cartridges when I quit a week ago, but I was feeling so desperate to eat and sleep that I actually dug one of them out of the trash, disinfected it, and smoked for 3 more days. Not one of my most proud moments.

My dad tells me to keep smoking because it gives me a break from life for a second. I have GAD and depression and I think he just gets worried about me, which is why he wants me to keep going because smoking let me feel happy for a bit. A part of me agrees with him, another part knows it’s cold turkey or addiction. There is no middle ground for me, at least not right now.

Today is day 2 of being sober (2 days since my relapse ended). I need to eat, so I’m forcing down a bowl of soup right now. It’s not enough, but it’s better then nothing. I’m tired but know I won’t be able to sleep tonight. I feel sad and empty. Everything feels terrible, even the things that I love make me feel sick. I just wanna curl up and die.

Im not sure why I decided to post, I just needed to yell into the internet void. This fucking sucks. All I want to do is smoke so I can feel better but I won’t let myself. Sobriety doesn’t feel worth it right now. 

Thanks for reading this rant, fellow human. I finished my bowl of soup, so now I’m gonna go find something else to do to fill the empty feeling inside.",24,1

I finally called my PCP last Wednesday and per her instructions I found myself in an ambulance to the ER because I was too weak to even deal with taking a taxi and was getting so dizzy.  

This past weekend I finally started to feel a lot better!! Today I ate my first real food in over a week!! I am not sure how my body will process it but it was so good I wanted to cry!

Psychological symptoms are setting in more such as major irritability and severe boredom but I know that will ease with time.  I am feeling very grateful right now because after being so sick last week and the fear I felt about it, I can't say I am really having any cravings so far!  I've never been sick like that and it just really shook me up.

It has been hell is all I can say. I felt so much better for around 3 weeks until about 4 days ago. A huge wave has come over me again, but the intensity of the symptoms have been short lived compared to previous months. Everything starts around 7pm to 9pm like before. I started having chest pain/cramps and stabs again, mostly in my sternum and left side. My left arm is tingling, my hand feels weird. I've been having the stabbing pains/zaps in the back of my head again. Head pressure and headaches too. The anxiety of having these symptoms again has been creeping up on me badly. The bradycardia went away this month, thank God. But the tachycardia has come again... I'm feeling dizzy and weak again. Yesterday I felt like fainting from getting up from my desk to the kitchen, my heart starts racing and I feel like passing out. But yeah, I had this too before in previous months and visited the ER and many doctors with nothing showing up. Just a healthy heart and clean bill of health. The sleep disturbances are real bad. I can't sleep again. I wake up multiple times in the middle of the night, feeling so sick and fatigued, heart racing, dizzy, weak, just plain sick.

On the good side of things, like I mentioned, I had sinus bradycardia for around 4-5 months, and finally the bradycardia is lifting, my heart is beating within a normal range again! My memory is so much better!  I still get some intermittent brain fog, but man, is it better than ever. I used to forget even where I was during those first months. I remember going out for a ride in my motorbike and forgetting how to get back home... But everything is so much better on the mental part. I had a lot of dp/dr, that has been mostly gone too. The depression has been lifting up as well. I'm starting to feel motivated again. I'm retaking the hobbies that I left behind. Life is better these days. I even found the time to work on projects I’ve delayed for a while.

Anyways, All in all, I'd say I'm around 60% now. I hope this following months bring more improvements, specially on the sleep part.",15,0

Now, do I think I could actually do that? Stop after one day? Yeah, maybe. Probably. Especially if I'm honest with my family about it beforehand. Even if it snowballs into a few days, I'm not so worried about stopping again. That's not really the problem.

The thing is, I really dont want to relapse. But I *do* want to relapse. But the idea of relapsing makes me want to cry. Giving up my hard won progress, back to day 1, becoming a liar and hypocrite once again, is really really not what I want. But I *still* want to relapse.

I'm so angry and frustrated with myself! 

I've finally been walking the talk, living my life much more on par with how I want to; exercising, eating better, doing my hobbies, not withdrawing into my room and cutting off my family. But none of that seems to be working, I'm still fighting the same cyclical demons and trapped on the merry-go-round from hell. 

I thought I'd passed this cross roads. I thought I'd fully committed to sobriety, come hell or high water. Well, the levee is breaking and my resolve is wavering and I'm so sick of myself for it! Why cant I just stick to what I know is right? Why do I always have to fight with my own better judgement and make everything harder for myself? 

I'm just sick of it, and I cant see a way out. If I give into temptation, then I'm back in the grip of addiction. If I hold out, I'm still stuck craving and denying and waiting for it to get better with no real evidence that it will. I need a third option and I have no idea how to find it.

I decided to stop because I realised a have anxious thoughts and felt like I wasted a big part of my life - I did finish bachelor studies, I live with my boyfriend, I have a job (but it's just something to earn some money and I am not satisfied with it) and I was kinda functional but I stopped investing time in anything that needs any effort. So first 2 weeks were hell I couldn't do anything but endlessly scroll through social networks and this sub but I said to myself it's okay just to stop thinking about smoking. Then I went to see a homeopath and that kinda helped me I was really hyped for a week but then it weared off a bit. Now I am not that bad as before but I don't know what to do wih my life. I want to find a job that I like and start discovering some hobbies or whatever normal people do. So do you have any suggestions? I thought this question might be useful for me and also for some other people who are struggling with becoming a human again 😆 I know you can't really know what I enjoy but to be honest I also don't know what I enjoy... I thought I love nature but it doesn't seem enough. I thought I like meeting new people and having a small talk with them but I feel empty and weird talking to people now that I stopped smoking. Sport seems like a good option I like swimming, kickboxing, yoga and horseback riding so I might do that. But it's too late to choose it as a profession and it doesn't seem that I will complete if I only do that. I feel like I am this overgrown child and I have to start everything from scratch. I finished philosophy so I don't really have a profession but it seems to me that only when you are doing something in your life, your days and conversations with other people have a meaning. So it might be crazy but what do you think I could do for living or fun? Does anyone else feel this way and is it normaln? How to start living and not just waiting for days to pass?

I notice I have been anxious and depressed about things when I have never been depressed before, at least I don’t remember ever  being depressed. 

Since January I tried to quit many times , and I have told her that I am quitting because of the drug test I have to do before I qualify in 1 year time. she’s been supportive. However I notice everytime I am in a quitting fase I don’t hear from her, or if I do it’s a text message and  no call. 
I relapsed many times and everytime she’s there ready to hang out, and come at mines etc. 

This time I told her this was the time, I sent her a list of my reasons why I was quitting, and she said as a joke that I offended her as that is her lifestyle.

I used to smoke all day every day for the past 3 years. I would spend between 150-300$ weekly on weed/dabs/edibles you name it. I didn’t want to spend my money like that anymore so I decided to quit. This is my 4th attempt and I’m feeling confident about it. 

I first started smoking weed so that I could get rid of the terrible nightmares I had. It worked but I got addicted to it to it and all of a sudden I never wanted to stop. Now that I have quit the nightmares are coming back but that isn’t the thing tearing me apart. It’s being in my own head.

I’ve never liked myself, from my appearance to how I think and process stuff I despise and loathe it all; I’ve been that way since I could conceive consciousness and myself as myself. What I didn’t realize weed did was remove that train of thought from my head. I would just smoke myself numb and do whatever it was I pleased because I could barely think about anything else other than the task at hand. Since I quit again I find myself in my head all the time, hating myself and everything about me.

All I want in life is to find a woman who loves me as much as I do her but I can’t seem to let myself think of anything else. I start thinking of wanting to be loved then it crosses over to me not feeling worthy enough of such emotion.

I never had this issue when I smoked ever and am so close to relapsing because I don’t want to always be stuck in my head like this. I just want control over myself to not think this way or about these things but I can’t control it and all I know is how to numb myself of reality and this feeling. I have a therapist but and I try the breathing exercises that were advised to me and other meditative exercises but during them and after them I still am thinking about the same crap.

I feel completely miserable, beaten up, frustrated and ashamed of myself. And I feel so guilty, confused and lost.

I’m scared of the thought of having to go through withdrawals again even though deep inside I know it’s the only way to go.

My thoughs are racing and I can’t fall asleep at night. 

I just feel like I completely lost a battle that was the most important thing of my life, and all that positive change and things I experienced since I quit was all for nothing.

Sorry for this whining. Just needed to get this off my chest",13,0

Without weed I cant sleep and it is my only way to cope with stress. Whenever I have a busy day I smoke to help myself wind down.

A couple months ago after a suicide attempt I quit completely for 7 months. After that I wanted to smoke again but not fulltime. I did it once every 2 weeks but that didn't last long, and now i'm back where I started. 

Weed completely controls my life

It also doesn't help that pretty much all of my friends smoke as well. 

Does anyone have any suggestions that could help me?",4,0

I have been on r/leaves for a while now and really enjoy the motivation and love that comes from the community. Seriously you people rock! It really does help me with seeing a different prospective which is very healthy i believe.

Anyways i am 24 and I used to live in the Elk valley and there is no other lifestyle I'd rather live. My soul needs to be back in the bush skidooing, snowboarding, hiking, dirtbiking, fishing and the small town love you get nowhere els. Personally that is what life is all about.

I have quit cannabis before and know the side effects that i experience. Night sweats, mood swings, cranky pants, loss of appetite UGH its gunna suck. I can already feel nauseous now as i write this. Scatter brain also like cant focus on anything. Right now i kinda feel like i have  prolonged the Inevitable like wow scooter you have been under a cloak of hazy dankness for so long lol

But i have never quit with personal intentions in mind. 
Its always been for someone like parents or to work a stupid job where i find myself trapped an unhappy.
So i think this will make the mental side of this a bit easier because i want to live in a place that enables me to do the things i love to do. 

Time to start playing guitar and meditating alot more. Its the only way i can control the sensations and thoughts about the devils letuce.

1) threw everything away and took out the trash so I wouldn’t be susceptible to trash diving
2) downloaded smoke free, which has a virtual assistant that checks in with you and gives you daily missions. Main purpose is for cigs but I have repurposed it. First mission was setting aside money everyday to buy something important to you so you have a goal to work towards (new driver here I come)

My expectations are just high, I figured out that finding the right person is super important #1, followed by money so you can both work less and do fun things in life that need money, travel, and support kids. Then number 3, also need to feel satisfied with your work. Then theres number 4, friends and hobbies, and 5 health. I think my freakout was just that I'm late to life and fearing my own mortality, but now I get it. From now on I want everything. Life is so complex and there are so many parts of it,  everything can be improved, love, money, career, friends, hobbies. I hope that was a good epiphany. So being sober now after 42 days,  I finally get it now, and now i am greedy and want everything good in life. It's a shame I started so late, and I get that we cant all have the best of all worlds, but we are always trying to get better in all those aspects.  I know what I want but how do I get there fast enough  is the question now, and I can't change my appearance, have to get super lucky to find an unattractive girl I'm attracted to, who happens to also like my messed up weirdness, small frame, voice, and weird appearance. Wish I had stopped smoking weed sooner, or gotten  to my backup career many years ago. So I am very behind financially, and life skills, and by the time I fix that and less lazy, and improve on those 5 things, I will be in my 40s already. I know what i want but don't know how to get there fast, or if I even can.

I guess with enough money one could get plastic surgery and get their bones modified as well. So money is huge, but you may not feel the same after neurologically.

I knew our relationship didn't depend on weed, but I also knew it was a big part of it, and I wasn't sure what our day to day would look like going forward with me getting sober.

He hasn't smoked for the last few weeks, I think both to be supportive of me and because he's been less interested in doing it alone. We have had the most *incredible* time. We laugh more, we try more things, we talk more. It's just been this spring in our step. We drove to a beach one evening at an hour we certainly would have been high before. Took a couple of books and just hung out and listened to the water sharing cool passages we read. So fun and different from our usual sitcom and bong hits.

With the exception of the summer of 2010, I've been smoking daily since sometime in 2006. I'm in my early 30's and I've been telling myself to slow down, or quit for years.

Since then, my life has only gotten bigger and bigger. Today I live a life I couldn’t have dreamed of before. 

Weed made my life very small. Weed kept me at home on the weekends when I should’ve been out enjoying my early 20s. Weed kept me from picking up the phone when friends called because I was too high and couldn’t be bothered. Weed kept me from having the energy to grocery shop and cook, which left me ordering take out every night. Weed kept me broke, spending every dollar I had on overpriced flower. Weed kept me stagnant at work because I lacked any motivation or drive. Weed kept my apartment messy because I didn’t have the energy to clean. Weed kept me complacent, which meant I never tackled new interests or hobbies. Weed kept me feeling embarrassed, ashamed, and stuck. Weed kept me wondering why I couldn’t be “normal” and live like everyone else. 

It wasn’t until I stopped smoking that I realized that I’m just as capable as anyone else. That is, when I’m not smoking my energy, drive, and passions away.

I have taken like 2 edibles in that tike and realized why I stopped. But I started smoking when I was 15/16 years old with my best friend at the time. Me and him were really close friends, lived right across the street from eachother and went from smoking a gram a week, to smoking an ounce a week. We had a ton of fun together, and in our senior year of highschool there were 4 of us. We were great friends. And every friday night we would go to one of their house and smoke in his back yard while his mom made us food and it became a ritual thing.

But this went of for year until I turned 20. I started getting paranoid and crazy anxiety all the time. I was living with my best friend mentioned earlier and another friend at the time. I told them I was quitting, and... it didnt go well. They both thought I would rat them out for some reason, so things turned ugly and I decided I was done with these friends. Moved out and 1 month later I decided to work on a career instead of working dead end jobs.

So I attended a programming bootcamp. 2 months no weed at this point. I thought it would be hard to actually finish this, because I always had a hard tome focusing in school. Turns out I couldn't focus in high school because I was always high. I actually did really well at this bootcamp because I was sober. When I finished I decided to take a job in IT but also gave me the opportunity to write code as well so my $10k to a coding bootcamp didnt go to waste lol.

I stayed at that job for 3 years. And it was the best job ive ever had. So much fun, my boss was amazing. I left the job 2 months ago, and took a new job with much higher pay but still doing the same thing. And I love this job a lot as well. I recently reached out to those old friends. They are still stuck in dead end window washing jobs, living in a shitty apartment together, and have no ambition to change.

I hate to say it but I am so glad im not a bum like them anymore. I really dont think weed is bad. And it should absolutely be legalized. But I also believe it holds people back. My 2 old friends were very smart. One was a great athlete and could have gone far snd played football for a great college. But he decided to not even try. The other took AP classes and was just very smart but decided he didnt want to go further after high school. The weed held them back. And it sucks because they were my best friends. 

So to anyone here reading this and is in their first day, week, month. I hope this helps you see the long term effects of what can happen. I know many people who are very successful and smoke weed, and good for them. But I do think the majority of us need to let it go after awhile to take that next step in life.",60,0

It's difficult cos it's been such a big part of my life but it's also been a catalyst to not caring about my life. I've always struggled with anxiety and depression but I need to face it all now.

I'm finding it very difficult, I'm not getting cravings to be high, but it feels like my brain is craving it to feel normal and I'm freaking out a few times a day.

My emotions are all over the place, and anxiety is through the roof. I'm feeling very irritable and restless so trying to keep busy. I hope I can feel like a normal person again soon.

due to this, it causes me paranoia, anxiety attacks, and good old hallucinations (things moving that shouldn't be, vision goes flat, ect.) 

i want to quit. so bad. like fr. and my partner (who has smoked this heavy for about 3 years now, we've been dating for most of it) and i kinda thought he was gonna help me along it by smoking less. this is only because he told me he was only going to buy one 3.5 this week. I horribly said 'good luck with that' jokingly, which I now regret, as once I said that he said 'I thought you'd say you believe in me'. I apologised on the spot and said I did believe in him and ill support him, ill do it with him. (just to clarify, he's not been more than like 4 days without smoking in a very very very long time, therefore I was very certain he wouldn't go more than 5, but I was unnecessarily mean) 

Well, he's just about to pick up another 3.5. 2 days later. and we had a ten yesterday (i did smoke a little, but the bad effects came as they always do, so I stopped) and he was smiling saying 'he didn't pinky promise' and laughing. its really hurt me. why say something like that when you can't stick to it. I'd rather he didn't tell me he was gonna do something that he wasn't going to do. but then again, he's addicted. I can't blame him. and he's not wanting to quit. just cut down a little because we spend all our money on it. I miss the days where it was less. we were happier. we went on dates and could buy eachother gifts. I'd love to be able to buy him something once a month. it's upsetting. 

he says if we ever broke up he would be fine living his whole life smoking weed and dying as young as possible and not doing anything else. I understand he's sad. he's very sad. and i love him so much. but knowing I'm the only thing pushing him to achieve anything and he isn't making any effort off of his own free will, is hard. knowing if we broke up, he would just do jack shit with his life is hard. I feel a lot of pressure. I will tell him how I feel but I'm just going to make him feel guilty.

I don't know what to do, reddit.

I feel stuck.

I love this man, and I want to be with him for a long time, but I don't know how it's gonna work out long term. in general, he's the best person i know, he's got a kind heart and he loves me to bits. i just have this sinking feeling in my gut. 

also, he's my first love. and to add to that, i struggle with symptoms of bpd due to certain traumas. 

also, we broke up once before and I was ruined for 6 months (break up was due to family problems, nothing to do with weed), and the only reason I was okay again was because we got back together...

I really care about him. so much. i don't want his life becoming just smoking weed and doing jack shit all else. he just doesn't care enough about himself to care. 

TL;DR: I live with bf, bf smokes lots, I want to quit bc of the bad effects, he said he would only buy one 3.5 this week, he bought a ten the next day and is getting a 3.5 today. he says he won't be anything without me and will just be a bum who smokes weed all the time. I love him but don't know what to do. I feel a lot of pressure. I don't want a breakup. he's my first love. help.",2,0

I don't feel clear headed, I feel overwhelmed with thoughts that used to be manageable. I wake up 3-4 times a night from dreams, which makes me groggy and irritable all day. 

I have always hated dreaming, feels like being lied to by my own brain. Dreams are disorienting, every time I wake from one it takes me a while to figure out what's real. They trigger unwanted emotions that linger for hours. Good dreams leave me disappointed and depressed, bad dreams leave me panicked and angry. I hate waking up in these moods. Worse still is the lack of sleep. It takes me a long time to get back to sleep. I'm averaging 4 hours a night right now, and it's only been a week. 

To top it off I can't concentrate on anything. Smoking put me in the zone, I could work for 6-12 hours without breaks without noticing if I didn't set timers. Without it, I can't focus on one thing for more than 5-10 minutes.

The only advantage is that I'm losing weight, but that comes with constant stomach pains, itchy skin, and alienating my family when I can't stomach to eat dinner with them.

I did something I never do when I am high, had fun with my dogs. I started vacuuming my house and turned on some old throwbacks I haven’t heard in forever, mainly karaoke songs. Next thing you know two hours have passed of me and my dogs dancing around the house and having a blast singing songs. I would never do this high, I’d sit on my phone while the music played in the background. 

It feels so good to have fun with a clear head. I have battled addiction of multiple substances for years, I finally think I have the motivation necessary to accomplish this. Next time I want to smoke, I am pulling at the vacuum and turning this playlist back on. I am going to grab my dogs favorite toys and we are going to sing, dance, clean, and play away the desires.

Been on the sub and discord for a hot minute now. I am a 21 M who used daily for roughly two years in college. I am on day 84 rn and though I do feel more stable generally, this last week has put me through hell and back. I am writing this, partially just to jot down my thoughts. It’s therapeutic for sure to come here to Leaves and speak with you all.

For those of you former chronic users dealing with intense anxiety/panic 3 months into quitting like myself….my God….I salute you. This beast that haunts us feels like it cannot be shaken off. It feels as though I am at war with my own thoughts. I pray these intrusive thoughts and irrational fears will eventually subside. I have even heard of former long term users experiencing anxiety and other PAWS symptoms for a while before breaking through at around the 6 month mark. I hope for the sake of my sanity that this will be my case.

Until then, I confide in you amazing, powerful and beautiful people. Thank you leaves friends for everything. This group is truly an anchor in the most turbulent of seas. 

One thing I have realized can set off nighttime anxiety is a large meal before bed, or something that simply does not agree with the stomach, be it dairy or sugar. Had no idea the impact would be this strong/debilitating, though. Recovery really puts us in tune with our own physical well being. Sometimes I wonder if the weed makes us physically less resilient and as a result, recovery is more difficult as our weakened bodies now endure the consequences of substance abuse even after the substance is long gone.

I truly love the people of this sub. I wish you all the best on your journeys and I only hope mine and yours will come to a happy, fullfilling and peaceful end relatively soon. We are all battling the beast, but at least we battle together. Thank you all, again and never ever hesitate to reach out to me if you need.

Peace and Love,

Now I've fallen right back into my previous use, not a whole lot, like 1-2 infused joints per day. Now that I've dulled down my brain so to speak, that just gives me a mild head change. But that first time after 10 months I was SO intoxicated and out of it. Just from a couple of hits.

I should have taken this as a clue to not continue, but the next day bought another joint and got SUPER high again. But after a few weeks my supposed tolerance skyrocketed.

I am 21, almost 22, and have been smoking consistently since I was 14 (Thanks to parents with an EXTREMELY loose view of weed, but that's a whole other story) . I have been trying to quit for 2 years now. Never go much further than 3-5 days.

There have definitely been ups and downs in this process. My dreams are still wild, I sweat like a pig even when I'm doing nothing, and I still don't have a good coping strategy for nights so I typically just end up sitting on my couch irritable because I'm not high. I also have been sleeping for 12 hours a day, and feeling like I could sleep even more after I do.

However, the ups to this process have significantly outweighed the downs. I am a particularly lazy stoner. However for the first time in YEARS I feel driven to do something more with my life. I feel driven, motivated, and more confident. I feel like I can think clearly. I have achieved more in the last 2 weeks than I have in the past year.

I was a daily user and i never missed a day for nearly 3 years i worked a full time job so most days aftet work i would smoke a couple bowls and usually very large amounts, towards the end of me quitting smoked about a oz a month. During my worst times i smoked a oz in about a week. My reason for quitting was the fact i no longer smoked for fun to have a good time i was using it as a every 45mim excuse to go outside and get high and i felt like absoulte garbage at times coughing up black gross phlem and sometimes puking from over consumption although this was rare. 

When i first quit the usual withdrawl symtoms hit me pretty hard, no sleep, no appetite, feeling very anxious (this triggered very bad health anxiety for me that i had previously to smoking). These symptoms made me realize that withdrawl from weed is a very very real thing. I was going nights with 3 hours of sleep because it was impossible, i would wake up in full body sweats completely soaked needing to change my sheets. I also had positive bowel changes a few weeks i notice i go more constiently less constipation and overall better gut health, i also found i was urinating less and just seemed overall healthier, as well as a increased sex drive by a pretty significant amount.  that made me feel more positive about the whole thing i still struggle now with sleep a little bit but for the most part things have gotten better (last smoked april 10).

I would say this was when the PAWS started kicking in for me or just the fact my brain and nerves were so fryed for so long. I started to experience very tight muscles sort of weird muscle contractions and am getting random twitching all over my body mainly this lasts just a few seconds then dissapears but can later return again generally only for a few seconds, this has been triggering my health anxiety pretty severly and i was hoping anyone could share some experiences with overall muscle issues or even twitching or things of the sort like muscle fasciculations. Anyways i hope this was somewhat helpful to some people out there that feel like absoulte garbage right now, overall im a better person since quitting i feel clear about my need for family for love for everything around me including my health & life realization. Just know the sleeping and the sweating and the worry after quiting does get better (i suggest slowly coming down to lower amounts of consumption per day to decrease the level of symtoms or the severity of how fast they come on)

It makes it harder to regulate my emotions. It can make me depressed, especially when I think about how little progress I'm making in the short term. It can make me anxious, especially when I think about how much work it'll take to get where I'm going in the long term. 

&#x200B;

When things get hard, I have shown a tendency to give up. A lot of the time, what that looks like is me getting high and escaping the hard things in life. But I don't want to give up any more. I am 30 years old, and I have a solid idea of what kind of life I want. I want a big house on a lake. I want a nice car, or at least enough money that I'm not constantly worried about what I'll do if my car breaks down somehow. I want to always be improving myself. I want to always be getting better at the things I value. These include physical fitness, writing (fiction, lyrics, etc.), and making decisions based on love for myself and others instead of fear. Fear is often what makes me give up. Almost always. It's the fear that I won't be good enough, and that I'll fail. In my last relationship, the first big misunderstanding we had put me into a downward spiral that led to me giving up on the relationship and withdrawing. I spent all day smoking weed and playing video games. I'd be embarrassed to answer her when she asked how my day had gone. I got more and more distant and withdrawn. I wasn't the one to end the relationship, but I might as well have. I accepted it almost without question. I accepted that it was for the best, for both of us. 

&#x200B;

It was the first step in the realization that I was hitting bottom. Within a month of that breakup, I started to come out of my slump. I played less video games. I smoked less weed. I started working out again, and eating more, and doing things that encouraged mindfulness and engagement with the real world. I wrote more music, and for the first time recorded something. Not something good, but something. And starting is always the hardest part.   


After a little while, I realized that my interactions with my ex (still friends) were getting better and better. I felt more able to appreciate her. More connected. I started to feel like we could make things work. I told her this, and she was hesitant to try again. She didn't give me a real answer. She likes the changes I've been making, but she's scared things will go back to how they were. I get that, and I don't blame her. I got into a place of extreme anxiety. It was constant, and unrelenting. Because I didn't have an answer, I didn't have peace. And I knew that weed would make that anxiety disappear, at least for a while. The weird thing was that I started refusing to do it. I would be in tears, pacing my bedroom, and telling myself, ""I REFUSE to give up."" I didn't want to take the easy way out any more. I didn't want to give up on clearing my mind of the influence of weed. I've given up on so many things in my life, and I was done giving up on shit. I stopped smoking on my own, and a few days later, I stopped smoking with my friends (last night, during a busy work shift, I passed my one week mark without realizing). I'm not giving up on my clarity. I'm not giving up on my fitness goals. I'm not giving up on my music. I'm not giving up on my future. I'm not giving up on myself. I'm refusing to give up.

I can't blame weed for my choices. But I am ready to acknowledge that I make worse decisions when I'm high. I choose video games, and I push people away. I choose the easy path, instead of the path that takes me where I want to be. When I'm high, I give up. And I'm done fucking giving up.",12,0

During that week I felt a lot of euphoria, energy, and it felt sooo good to socialize with co workers, even though usually I'm so anxious that I am reserved. 

And August 8 is when I finally got shit done. Documented all my spending for the past two weeks, paid my bills, and did other errand as well. Also felt like a really happy energetic day whereas while I was smoking weed I barely had the willpower to make it to work on time(was often still late) 

But starting about the day before yesterday is when I finally started feeling sad. Super irritated and everything bothered me so much. Most of what my mind could focus on is how stupid and inefficient things were, including people. (Like not using the turn signal while driving, no matter how easy it is and even when the lane change they're making is quite risky). And today is the first night I could not even sleep an hour... 

I've suffered withdrawals before but I'm concerned cause I don't remember feeling that euphoria and then the insomnia and sadness coming after. It was always the other way around as far as I could tell.

Just wanted to share that or if anyone had a similar experience of insomnia and depression appearing over a week after stopping, especially after feeling really good and energetic in the beginning...

33y, daily (ab)use since early twenties. Second time I got my shit together to be a leaf for life... I threw away >5months last spring cause I thought I could manage just 1 evening smoking with friends. They can handle an occasional smoke, my brain tricked me I could as well. Then I thought: just this weekend, followed by: 'end of month'... and so on. 

Anyway, back to square1, but with some extra experience I should put in use...

Thinking about telling some of my best friends about this struggle, and the fact I want the quit4life... perhaps it could avoid a stupid relaps.

So far I just always tell them that Im on a break cause it would do me good. 
Instead I should try to be blatenly honest: when Im high, the only single thing I want is to be sober, and that I have endless thoughts about quiting and get my life back on track..

When I am smoking, I think about getting high constantly and plan most of my life around it. I have had what I would consider successful periods in life with weed where I felt extremely happy, and focused on spreading happiness to everyone else around me (including a 9 year old daughter that I’m so blessed to have). On the flip side, I’ve had incredibly low moments while smoking. I would be depressed and extremely dependent on weed to do much of anything, and when I finally managed to quit the depression would still be there. 

I’ve smoked for more time than I haven’t since first starting, so it’s hard for me to tell who I really am without weed. Life goes by so much slower without weed which sounds so nice. Recently I had to think  whether or not my daughter was actually 9 and not 7, and then felt sad that she actually is 9. It’s like the years have totally gone over my head. And I have to think twice about being 29 like I have no idea what even happened since I began smoking weed at 14 although I’ve been through quite a lot of life in that time, even drove trucks for 9 years (driving around with fake pee on me for a lot of that).

All of that writing was pretty random. I started this post with the thought that it could help others. I went to look for posts and thought why not write one myself, something I don’t typically do. Currently, I’m laying in bed YET again on day 1 of no weed, and let me tell you it is such a bitch to making here on day1. Before finally walking up my stairs to my bedroom, I was lingering so much just craving to go take a toke in my garage. I battled in my head for a bit until managing to somehow not smoke and get to this point where I’m writing this now. I could have sworn I was going to cave. Well here I am sober and in bed so that’s pretty cool. On to day 2.

I really have to stop now. The longest breaks in all those years I had were 2 weeks when I went on vacation and couldnt get any. In the last year I tried to stop several times and made it a few weeks and even a little over a month earlier this year. At the moment I am again on Day 12 without smoking. At first i tried to compensate with alcohol, but luckily I dont like it very much and I can go months without drinking anything. So i got that part under control. I feel sad/depressed a lot to the point of suicidal thoughts, have no appetite at all although I am already underweight and feel socially isolated in that I dont really want to talk to anyone, even my best friends (some of them smoke, some dont, it doesnt matter to me) and the sweating when sleeping is really bad. I made it to the point where my dreams returned and I feel like some traumatic stuff I have been burying deep down has surfaced in them and my mental health is better of for thinking and dreaming about these things for once and not pushing them away like I did all those years. My dad was an alcoholic who fell often while drunk throughout my life. In early 2018 he fell head first on the sidewalk, leading to bleeding in the brain which left him 80% braindead. The doctors told me its a miracle he survived at all (and I wish he didnt, because what followed was worse than dying in my opinion). He continued to live 2 years and 3 months as a vegetable tied to the bed and it was absolute hell to see him like that and also how nurses treated him. It really broke my heart. He was unable to communicate at all and the tips some people gave me to ""try bringing him back"" so to speak left me just speechless and it seemed to me they were partly blaming me for not trying hard enough. I wanted to shake these people and tell them do you know what fucking braindead means ??? They never even visited or maybe once and expect me to magically heal him, as if he would just stand up and talk again. He died at the height of the covid pandemic in 2020 and I couldnt even visit him in the last few months. I now have to face reality and cant hide behind being stoned to deal with these experiences. But I think I can manage somewhat sucessfully and I am convinced these things will improve with time.

But I cannot sleep at night at all without smoking. I am wide awake the whole night, every night. I am talking going to bed at 10 am and sleeping til 3 or 4 pm every day. This obviously creates a ton of problems for me. I tried staying up for the whole day instead of going to sleep in the morning countless times and it only results in me staying up another whole night. I tried natural sleeping aids from the pharmacy, they dont work on me. Exercise makes me physically exhausted but my mind needs to shutdown so to speak to get me sleeping and it doesnt matter how physically exhausted I am, I cant sleep. Im starting to feel like Edward Nortons character in Fight Club. My mind is trying to trick me by telling me ""just smoke 1 joint every night so you can sleep"" but I know its BS, because i will be sleeping extra long to make the night and therefore smoking come earlier and it will be my top priority all the time and I will be basically just waiting for it. Also i know it would never be enough and i will be smoking more and more once again. I hate that I seem to have no agency of my own in this, my willpower is just lacking. I am writing this to get it off my chest and see it all layed out in front of me and be motivated by the fact that things got so bad I cant function as a normal adult to keep me from smoking anymore for good. I have several addicts in my family ,most of them already dead from their respective addictions.

It hasn’t been easy but between me wanting to quit and work drug testing me in a couple weeks, it’s been a great time to try and go sober. I’ve had highs and lows, may have made other dumb decisions (not hard drugs, just dumb decisions with money), but I’ve been getting through. This is maybe the third or fourth time I’ve tried to get sober and so far has been the most successful. The last time I tried to go sober was right before we went into quarantine last year. Which didn’t make things easy and that’s why I fell back into the addiction easily.

Anyways, here’s the main point of my post. My girlfriend and I are long distance (about two hours) which means she’s barely been there to help me get through this. I visited her this weekend and she had some edibles just lying out on her nightstand. It did suck seeing them but I didn’t make a fuss. I just handed them to her and mentioned, “you should probably put these away.” She proceeded to just place them on the floor next to the bed and said “put away.” I kinda just looked at her and asked if that’s really where she’s gonna put them away. She pushed back asking “where else should I put them?” I didn’t want to snap so I just backed off and said “that’s fine.” My question is, am I overreacting with her actions in regards to my struggles? It feels like she’s diminishing my addiction, even though she always claims she doesn’t. Like after two weeks, there’s no addiction anymore and I’m good in her view. It hurts because it’s not easy. I’m not expecting a reward or something for every day sober. But maybe some understanding. For context, we’re both 25 and have been in a relationship for a little more than 6.5 years. I’ve been addicted to weed for about 5 years. The last 3.5 the worst of it.

A bit of a long, complicated story but I would appreciate any help I can get. For reference, I’m a female, 25 years old, a bodybuilder, and married.

Sometime late 2019 I was diagnosed with “idiopathic intracranial hypertension” which basically means my cerebrospinal fluid built up too much causing extreme debilitating headaches and blindness. I had emergency surgery on my optic nerves and was (still am) medicated with a diuretic to control the fluid buildup. Even after the surgery, I was getting some serious eye pain so I chose to get my medical card and started vaping.

Shamefully, I began abusing my weed and smoking all day, every day. I’m talking live resin carts, edibles, the works. Wake up, toke. Work for a few hours, toke. Before I eat, toke. Before sex, the gym, bed, etc. you get the point. Toking even when I’m NOT actually in pain and going through a cartridge on average two weeks.

Well, to add some background, I have coping issues with stress, always have since I was 9 years old. Significant stress causes me to become anxious, paranoid, episodes of derealization, etc. I used to take mood stabilizers for 10+ years. This runs in my family.

Lately I’ve been been having some real issues with my husband. He’s my best friend. We’ve been married for one year and dated for four, but I have some serious concerns. When I start feeling really stressed like that, I always stop smoking so I can “see clearly”. I don’t want to be under the influence when I’m talking/arguing or making decisions and risk saying something wrong.

But I realized that whenever I stop smoking, I feel absolutely awful. Extreme paranoia, worry, frustration, questioning the meaning of life, losing touch with reality, cold sweats, loss of appetite, headaches, etc. I’m not sure if this is from a lack of dopamine, or if it’s my coping issues coming to the surface again.

To make matters worse, when I feel this bad, I stop wanting to go to the gym. I completely withdraw with no motivation for anything. Which is bizarre for me because I’m a competitive athlete. I didn’t go for one straight week, but I forced myself to today and I do feel a bit better…

I’m worried — I don’t know what’s the REAL me. Do I really want to be with my husband? Are the weed withdrawals just causing me to become over emotional? Will this pass, or am I suffering from some sort of mental illness? I can’t eat, I can’t think, I just feel like an endless loop of doom and gloom and random crying. I’m afraid to smoke again on the off chance that it is masking my real feelings, so I’ve only taken two hits in 5 days and I immediately felt better each time.

I did start seeing a therapist but we haven’t dug into all of this yet… we didn’t even talk about weed, only my history of mood disorders. She said it sounded like a chemical imbalance — possibly dopamine or serotonin.",4,1

In the last few years I have accepted that I am addicted to marijuana and that I want to quit permanently. It is easy to admit, with a smoking bowl in my hand, that I am addicted to marijuana. To me addiction is a maladapted coping mechanism, something that is soothing in the moment but has long term negative consequences, something you keep doing despite those consequences.

The best success I have had quitting was a 10 month period that started with a month long stay at a meditation retreat. I found that meditating was very agitating in the short-term but soothing in the long-term. In the end meditation, despite how annoying and terrible it is, gave me the sense of peace that cannabis never did. It might not be the solution for everyone but it worked for me.

Of course right now I am a daily smoker and it's been a long time since I have meditated more then a few minutes once or twice a week. I know that daily meditation is a necessary part of my recovery, but I don't think about it very often because it is an uncomfortable to think about quiting.

It is easy to just smoke another bowl, but I want to quit. I have always believed that change comes from within first, so I start by changing the way I think. I will watch my thoughts and when I think ""I am addicted to marijuana"" I will catch that thought - the problem - and replace it with my solution - ""I could meditate.""

Hey guys, I tried to write this out a couple days ago, but I just didn't have the focus yet to write anything down - I know you probably know the feeling. And like most of you, I've been lurking around for quite a while in absolute desperation - truly feeling suicidal every day for weeks before I finally hit that wall of - it's quit or live in this weird, paranoid, depressed state forever. Also I couldn't afford it anymore, which definitely helped in my motivation to quit as well.

I think the biggest issue I had in quitting was that mental wall - once I remembered how much better I felt before smoking, and when I started visualizing myself actually being free of this drug, that was sorta the breakthrough. It honestly felt like a survival state was kicking in, and it forced me to ween off and quit. I read a ton of stories here, watched a ton of videos, and eventually worked up the courage to make the jump. I just had to see how bad my life had gotten, and I had to see other people thriving off the drug after having gone through what I was going through. A relationship with weed DOES honestly feel like a real relationship, and I had to, literally with my voice, tell her it's over.

I tried my best to cold turkey it, but there was just no way - and as much as everyone I've heard from online says cold turkey is the only way, I'm living proof that a rapid taper CAN work if you feel like cold turkey is too much on your mind, body, and spirit. It was for me - every symptom in the book plus awful hallucinations.  
At the height of my using before slowing it down, I was probably smoking 6-9 times a day, though they were a couple hits each time. Still - absolutely out of control. I was literally smoking half my paycheck to try to feel ""okay"", when it was actually destroying my mind more and more every day. I did that every day for about 2 years. 

I'm not telling you what to do, you have to make that choice for yourself on how you go about it, and it may take a few tries. I'm just sharing to provide some encouragement for those who are still afraid. Like many others, I just WISH I had done it sooner.

So here's what I did, I tapered my smoking down over the course of around 5 days before making the full jump. This is approximately how I did it:  
Day 1 - From 7 times a day to 5 times a day  
Day 2 - Down to 3 times a day  
Days 3 & 4 - Stayed at 3 times a day  
Day 5 - Smoked once in the morning and once at night  
Day 6 - nada, nuh-uh, nothin baby. kissed the ganja goodbye.

The most bizarre component to my experience with this was how bad the withdrawal was during those days I was tapering compared to the day I actually just didn't smoke at all. I expected hallucinations again, or nausea, but it actually felt ""okay"" all things considered, and especially compared to my first attempt at a cold turkey, which was terrifying. The fact that I could somewhat function that first day of no smoking gave me so much motivation to keep going, so I just stuck with it.

I'm currently on day 5 of no THC or anything Cannabis related at all. 

At this point, I'm feeling SUPER CHARGED in some ways, like my physical energy is through the roof, it's almost ridiculous lol. Yesterday and today, I hate to say it, but I absolutely killed it at my job. It was awesome, and I felt so proud of myself.

However, I definitely still feel bad a lot of the time. I'm still having a decent amount of brain fog, and I still don't 100% feel like me yet. I feel PISSED all the time, especially when I watch the news or hear people talking politics, it makes me want to SCREEEAM lol.  
I can taste the feeling of being ""me"" again, though, and it's got me excited to heal. My main concern is, being an artist, I have only enough focus to write something like this out, and I'm still having trouble, for sure. I don't want to make it appear to be that I'm better, because I know I'm not there yet, it's only day 5, and I'm still longing to feel like ""me"" again, and to be able to make music the way I did before I started using weed.

One of the biggest motivational factors for me to quit was to regain the artistic focus I lost while smoking. I've heard that's one of the last abilities to return after your brain heals from quitting, but I guess I'm just having a lot of anxiety about how long it will take lol obviously I'm not gonna smoke again to try to write, I just want my natural art energy back, and I'm having some impatience over it - just because that's always been my #1 outlet - like many of you too, I'm sure.

So if you're lurking like I was, thinking about quitting, just try it, and mentally prepare yourself for what's to come. I know you can do this if you sincerely want it. Because that's what it seriously takes to get better, you have to desperately crave sobriety - even if there is a part of you that craves weed. I believe in you.  
I have to say also, I don't think I would have been able to work up the courage in the time I did if it wasn't for all of you here sharing your experiences. It's meant so much to me. I know everyone here says it, but THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. From the bottom of my heart, I owe you. You all have no idea how much you've helped me in my current situation.

All that being said, I'm just wondering - about how long did it take for you to regain your artistic focus and patience? How long did it take before you were able to thoroughly enjoy media again? I've heard some say it takes a month or two, but I've also heard people say they feel fantastic after a week or two, so I'm just sorta wondering what to expect from here out I guess. Thank you in advance, thank you.

Never again lol. This is my second time trying to post this, and I really don't have the mental energy to try it again, so hopefully this is good enough for you guys. (see above - pissed off at the world) lol.",8,0

I'm not saying I don't have thoughts of weed here and there

But it's like I don't remember it as much.

When I first started to quit again, it felt like time moved slowly. Every day was a great victory over my addiction and a show of persistence, despite the low mood.

And though every sober day still is a victory, and addictive patterns still lurk in the subconscious, it's much easier now to not focus on it so much. I'm reaching 3 weeks, and it's like ""oh?"" compared to the first few days that were like ""jeez, I'm glad I survived"".

Weed just doesn't occupy even nearly as much space and time in my life, as it did just few weeks ago, where I would have multiple thoughts about it during the day and feel drawn to go pick up. I kinda realise that while the thought of picking up might be there, it doesn't make sense to follow it. I feel much more at ease when not smoking in general.

Now that the train is rolling, all I gotta do is live my life and not focus on what it could be like to spark up or what it has sometimes been in the past. The golden days of haze are over, if I'm honest.

My intention is to grow as a person and evolve beyond my old limits. To do stuff I'm scared off doing, to learn to be in uncomfortable situations and expand my comfort zone that way.

Weed is an obstacle for that intention and goal. Smoking keeps me stuck, it's an excuse to not do many things.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I really want at the moment is:

\-to find a girlfriend

\-to become more skilled socially

\-to cultivate my existing friendships (which I tend to neglect sometimes, I just assume they stay good without doing much in effort of keeping them alive) and deepen connections with others.

\-stay healthy by exercising and eating mostly healthy stuff that's good for my wellbeing

\-play more guitar and find a band to make music with

&#x200B;

For me personally and based on my past weed habits, it gets much harder to do what I really want, and much easier to stay complacent and do nothing and waste my days away, if I keep smoking weed everyday.

So far in this 3 week sobriety I've reached out to people, gone on walks with friends, asked a cute co-worker out at the end of our summer job. That was the first time I've ever asked anyone out (got ghosted btw hahaha), and ran a 10k.

There's still bunch of stuff to learn and to do better, but I can't be in a hurry and stress myself. One day at a time, I'm doing the best I can.

I'm feeling positive, that I'm heading in a good direction. Hardships are there to help me grow beyond them. I've dealt with a lot of self-sabotage in my life, and I'm now learning to be responsible for my life, instead of being a victim to my circumstances and complain about them. That doesn't get me anywhere, nor does it make me feel confident.",15,0

That is exactly how I felt when I took my first break from weed after a lifetime of getting high every day. I was surprised to learn how it had impacted me, right there under my nose. And yet was never aware until I walked away.

I've been looking forward to this trip for a while and I have been thinking about how exciting it's going to be.

Until this morning.

I woke up and started to pack the camper and realized ""Oh fuck...I am going to be alone."" I started to kind of lose my shit--crying, panic attack, the whole 9 yards. I got pretty freaked out and I suddenly started to worry that I was going to fail miserably and the whole trip was going to be a dumpster fire.

I started thinking about who I could get some weed from and if I should buy some whiskey for the trip. These were serious thoughts and I got very frustrated when I reminded myself that that's not what I do anymore. 

I started crying some more.

922,2021-08-13 11:16:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p3mv8e/one_year/,One year!,"After several attempts to quit weed for good, I've finally hit the one year mark. At this point I would estimate that I'm about 80-90% recovered. I still have some other bad habits to deal with (periodically when these habits are under control I feel so peaceful I can hardly believe it). The clearest difference between then and now is in my ability to handle stress. In the beginning, if I slept poorly, drank too much or got into an argument (to name a few), I would feel horribly dissociated and anxious. These days almost nothing brings me anxiety. I feel much more grounded and creative. I have no doubt that at some point during the next year I will feel as if I had never smoked!

A rough timeline of my recovery:

months 1-3: constant anhedonia, depression, anxiety, low tolerance to stress / fragile nervous system

months 3-6: above symptoms peaked at the 3 month mark. The worst was over by the 6 month mark.

months 6-9: slow return of creativity, sociability and joy.

months 9-12: increased sense of normalcy, only minimally and periodically affected by any negative symptoms.

In retrospect, this seems to be a pretty typical timeline for a post-acute withdrawal syndrome, with the majority making a full recovery within 1-2 years. Since all my previous attempts to quit failed at me smoking ""just once"", I've decided that I will not ever smoke again. Earlier this decision felt like a loss, but at this point it feels like it doesn't make any difference (in a good way). Thank you for reading.",24,0

I’ve tried quitting multiple times over the last year, as it really is a process. Each time has felt a a little less hard and this time I really feel like will be it. The last time I quit back in May I decided to set up auto transfer to savings in my bank account and set it to put in 100/week, a little less than what I was spending a week on weed. (I often spent more on weed some weeks so this time am going to use the spare cash to treat myself to something around 100 dollars once a month for each month I stay sober as positive reinforcement)

Although I relapsed after one month exactly I know I wanted to quit again so didn’t cancel the auto transfer. I’ve now got 1,300 in savings and it feels really great. It’s very motivating and is another thing that keeps me dedicated to seeing sobriety through.

Something that is helping me, so just wanted to share. 

Hope everyone is feeling okay today, take a few deep breaths in and out, you’re doing great. ❤️",9,0
924,2021-08-13 11:04:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p3mj0c/i_decided_to_change_and_then_accepted_it/,I decided to change and then accepted it,"Weed was a part of my life for 20+ years. Now 14 months sober. From quite early on I knew I had a problem with it. Sometimes I would really enjoy it and other times not so much. It was something I did in secret (mostly) and learned it was something to hide from various people at various points in my life. This created a feeling of guilt that grew and grew over the years. Eventually I (mostly) got over this guilt as society changed and the people around me became more accepting. That didn't help my internal guilt as much as I would have thought. The guilt then turned towards my life style, the choices I would make and the path of my life. Most aspects of my life were somehow influenced by weed which was a thing I used and didn't totally understand why except that I sometimes enjoyed it and sometimes did not. 

I knew I had a problem and had convinced myself in various ways to accept that it was a part of my life, sometimes embracing and being proud of it. In some weird way I even though it made me special and gave me an advantage over other people who didn't use it. I thought it gave me an advantage because of the perspectives it gave me that I perceived to be beneficial.

Ones mood is greatly affected by weed. I was dependant on weed to control my mood. Sometimes I would become depressed for periods of time and other times I was flying high and feeling great. Fortunately and unfortunately, respectively, these never lasted. The lows were pretty low and the highs were very high, and compelling. Many times throughout my toking career during these lows I would decide to stop using weed. I was never prepared for what that meant though and I always knew deep down, in the back of my mind that I'd start using again.

By the time I reached the age of 40 something clicked. Life was passing me by. I had watched two decades of my life go by - stoned. Stoned almost everyday to varying degrees for 20 years. I established my career as a stoner, had children as a stoner, got married as a stoner. Developed and matured into an adult as a stoner. What would my life have had looked like if weed wasn't present that whole time? Do I just accept this is the way I am and this is the way my life will be and grow older and eventually die always questioning what things would have been like if things had been different?

Whether it was simply the fact of turning 40 or becoming more wise to my own insight a turning point started in my life. I finally acknowledged that I was in control of the choices I made and weed was indeed a choice I was making. I was determined to make a change and move foward in my life without weed playing a role anymore. This took a lot of internal psychological work and introspection that would need an entire separate post to fully explain, but I did it.

In the beginning it wasn't easy, even with my mind fully made up and the determination I needed to get through. There were physical withdrawals, there were psychological withdrawals and each presented their own challenge. All the while life was still going on around me and I had commitments and responsibilities. Days turned into weeks, turned into months and life started to become normal again. Day to day life starting to be satisfying and I looked forward to little things that before I had just taken for granted or didn't enjoy them at all because I just wanted to go home and get stoned. 

Mentally I faced all the things I was avoiding through using weed. This was difficult and humbling. In the beginning I didn't know what these things would be that I needed to face. As time went on it became clear what those were and I'd then work through them as best I could. 

Being a stoner for so long meant I had little effective coping skills for many of lifes normal trials and tribulations. This made things even more difficult as I recovered. Again, I applied myself and faced these head on as things came up and its a process I'll continue on improving for the rest of my life. 

After I decided to quit and accepted it my life began to change, ultimately for the better, day by day. It took perseverance before that was realized but with patience it did come. I'm out of the woods but I'm not done learning and growing. That will be premanent fixture in my journey of life.",34,0

But I'm determined to get to the bottom of this, so here goes nothing. 

For context, I am Filipino/British born and raised in the Philippines. This lifestyle in this country is... polarising to say the least. On one side of the coin, you have poverty-stricken communities making up the majority of our 3 major islands (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao). On the other, you have a small, highly elitist percentage of people living lifestyles so lavish you'd forget you're in a third-world country. 

I have experienced both sides of this highly dysfunctional coin, and as a result, am stuck between a rock and a hard place in my journey to sobriety. At the age of 20, I have experienced 5 years living quite literally on the streets, and yet somehow found my way into the most expensive, elitist school in Metro Manila (capital city). My father always had a way of losing all our money without so much as a savings account to rely on to making millions when the right factors line up. It was definitely a toxic and volatile way to grow up and ngl, I feel several of my mental health struggles stem from my father's incompetence with money. 

Without going too deep and making this entire post about my life story, here is THE MAIN point.

1. **I feel I deserve it when comparing myself to my peers** \- When you get to the top 1% of this country, you quickly notice how spoonfed the youth are. More than 90% of the people in my friend groups (who are relatively the same age as me) have not worked a day in their lives and as a result, turn into essentially big babies who rely entirely on their $10,000-$30,000 monthly allowances. I started hustling, working odd jobs, starting small businesses, just to keep food on the table for me and my mother. I've successfully quit a number of times, so I know full well the benefits of being off the green. However, when I look around me, when I realise how much shit my dad gets me into (literally passing his debt onto me when he found out i have a business), when I look at my spoiled-ass friends whining about not having enough time to hustle, when I look at how I went from a negative bank balance to feeding my mother and keeping the roof over our heads, I can't for the life of me shake the feeling that the value I add to my family justifies my weed addiction. The fact that I've been able to make more money than my father straight out of highschool makes me think ""why the hell not?""

Sorry for the long-ass ramble, not expecting many responses here, but I needed to air this out and hopefully get a fresh perspective on the matter. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this. I do want to quit, I really do. I can almost taste the boost in productivity and success it will bring me, but I'm blinded by justifications I can't get myself to see past. 

I am by no means saying I've had it the hardest. All it takes is one look at some of the awful things happening in the world to realise that in many ways, I am lucky. But from my perspective, having lived through it, I can at least say I've had it the hardest amongst any of my peers.",3,0

My shift to a better mood happened about a month and a half ago. And I’ve just been staying really busy with work and hobbies. The thing that helped me was diving head first into my passions.

(comedy writer),"I've been smoking nightly for most of the past 14 years and am now 40 years old and it's time to quit for good. The main problem I'm having is that it really helps me with my job. I'm a writer (novels and screenplays) and smoking a sativa (and even an indica) really helps me with my writing. I come up with a ton of great ideas, it really helps me with plotting (I can visually see the structure of the plot), and whenever I'm stuck, a quick smoke will have me immediately spotting where the story needs to go. I write comedy and when I smoke I can write out pages and pages of funny dialogue, scenes, come up with great comedic characters and awkward scenarios. I've filled out dozens of notebooks over the years and have come up with some of my best stuff when I'm high. I use these notes when I'm sober to write out the pages and flesh things out. I rarely have the ability to write out funny notes like this when I'm sober and lately, my creativity has been non-existent. It feels like smoking opens up a portal to my subconscious that I can't access when sober. 

Even though weed helps, I want it out of my life. I have two kids who are getting older and I don't want to be high around them. I don't want to wake up late and groggy anymore. I don't want to be addicted to it. I'm sick of the late night snacks and weight gain. I'm done. I can't smoke occasionally. I'm a daily user or nothing at all. I've quit for months at a time a few times over the years, but I always end up using again. Usually when I need it for creative reasons. It starts as once for work, then it leads into a week, and then lasts for months. I've been sober for 16 days now and it feels like I'll never be able to write anything funny again.

Here’s an interesting idea that I think will help some people. It’s been on my mind recently, and it’s helping my recovery.

Anything you enjoy is a drug.

Food is a drug.

Watching TV is a drug.

Spending time with a loved one is a drug.

And, obviously, weed is a drug.

Don’t think about quitting weed as quitting drugs. Think about weed as quitting a shitty drug that has a better alternative.

What is that alternative? I have no idea what yours is - you have to look within. I only know mine.

But everything I’m saying here can be summarized into this statement, my affirmation for quitting weed, my reason:

I don’t want to get high on weed, I want to get high on life.

Now, I know this line sounds corny, but if you think about it the way I do, that can change.

I think about everything I do, every task, every event - my alternatives - as getting high. As getting fucked up.

It might not make you feel the same way as weed, it’s just a different high. And when your alternative is something that you do consistently and progress in, guess what? Your high gets better every single day.

Just some things to think over. Addiction is hard, we all know that. I hope something I said inspires even one of you.

Happy recovery folks. Keep getting high. On life. 😉",15,0

Last August I met a wonderful person here in reddit and we ended up vibing almost immediately. I remember talking to this person and it felt as if I had known them my whole life. When we met we were both users of pot and after a year my friend got sober and has been actively working on her sobriety since. 

To get to the point, my friend and I have had a bit of a falling out of sorts. A couple weeks ago her and I got into an argument about my Marijuana usage, the fact that it's changed me, and how she didn't think she could be associated with me anymore due to my usage. I pretty much denied having a problem but now I'm starting to realize I was wrong and she was right. I haven't been myself (my true self) for over 5 years since I started smoking pot. It's costed me jobs, money, and now it's costed me a dear friend that I care about so much. 

She pretty much has blocked me on everything and I totally understand why. She has got to do what she can for herself. The question is how do I cope with this and actually quit? I'm surrounded by a family of pot smokers (that won't be much help to me quitting) and I live in a weed friendly state where it's literally everywhere around me all the time.

I was high every day for 23 years with the exception of the months I was pregnant. Other moms drank wine. I just preferred the ganja. That was my thought anyway.

Then about 3 years ago I admitted to myself it was a problem for me. Even though all seemed well on the outside (successful career, long-term stable marriage, kids, house, the whole deal), my head was all trashed inside. I was socially awkward. My relationships were very surface level. I had dreams inside I felt incapable of pursuing because I would rather get high. 

So I quit. And it was agony at first. I was an emotional wreck for a couple of weeks. But soon enough days, then weeks, then months rolled by. I made it one year sober, then 2, then 2 and a half. I didn’t think about it that much or even track days anymore.

Well, after a crazy year of working and homeschooling kids, my brain gave me this crazy idea I could just toke a bit on my nightly walks to take off some edge and indulge in alone time. “I’m not addicted anymore. I’m an adult. Other people drink. This will be my thing for Friday nights.”

Well that was a dumb idea.

I listened. I bought. I toked. I immediately felt bad. Swore not to do it again. Then a few days later was right back. 

So basically at almost the 3 year mark, I let myself slip into a full blown relapse. Every day for about a month and a half. 

No bueno.

Even while I KNEW how badly I felt (immediately started messing up my sleep and eating and exercise habits.. couldn’t remember things my spouse told me a few mins before, all the things…), I persisted in picking it up the next day. 

Screw that. Now I know how good it feels to be off and I want my life back.

I had some major wrestling to do with my own brain to get back to reality and fight for my first 24 hours back in the sober life. Whew. Now I’m on day 5. Not easy, but I’m here and I’m glad I’m doing it. I’m using it as a learning experience to capture the exact thoughts I had that led me there. And as a reminder that, sure some people can get high recreationally with no issues. I cannot. My brain knows this, and yet it will still offer me some rationale for smoking.

I hit this milestone this week, thought it was worth checking in again. I won’t talk at length, because it’s difficult to express how I feel at this point - words can point towards it, but I think it’s something you’d need to feel for yourself to understand. 
I do believe I’m still recovering, which is perhaps not surprising after more than three decades as a pothead. But I’ve also come a very long way. My mental health has without a shadow of doubt been the biggest beneficiary of quitting. I no longer suffer chronic health anxiety. I used to torture myself with imagined serious illnesses. My anxiety overall is very significantly reduced, I now get on with people - strangers and those I know well - with good humour and ease (and they’ve noticed)! I can think faster and in conversation I don’t stumble or struggle to find the right word half as much as I used to. I’ve lost a lot of weight and exercise regularly. I wake at about 630 every morning without an alarm, so I have to go to bed a lot earlier than I used to. I am a much happier man. 
That’s the good…. the bad is that it’s been an utter nightmare until about a month ago, maybe a bit longer. Once I got over the acute withdrawal I thought I was free and sorted. So wrong. The true effects of quitting came on like a terrible storm that I can’t quite remember now, but I have journaled every day since I quit and it’s all in there. Massive anxiety, paranoia, panic, fear, insomnia, for week after week after week. I’ve read about PAWS - I don’t know if this is what I went through but it doesn’t really matter what it was called. It was much harder than anything else I’ve dealt with - alcohol and other drugs. 
I don’t crave weed at all - not for months. When I smell it in the street it makes me shudder. I guard my quit carefully - not because I think I’m in danger of relapse but because I’d be a fool not to. 
Hmmm. I seem to have rambled on a bit! I hope this may be encouraging if you are in the very early stages - or are suffering the delayed symptoms I went through. I know how dreadful it can be - but it WILL pass. Take care. Steve.",112,0

Happy and stressed at the same time..,"Two and a half months ago I became burned out at work. I got a promotion at the tail-end of 2020, which turned out to be a job that didn't really suit me. I didn't enjoy it, and a series of setbacks just made it increasingly worse. And during that time (big suprise) my use went up. I was smoking any moment I could, beside work hours, just to escape the stress I was feeling. But that just made my job that much harder, since it was pretty demanding and emotionally taxing. And I started to burn out..

I asked for a demotion, to go back to the job I had before that. And I thought, that was it. That was the end of my career. I did enjoy that old job, but it didn't challenge me all that much. The realization that smoking weed was the reason I couldn't make my new job a succes, hit me hard. It forced me to take a hard look at myself. It made me realize that being a ""functional"" addict only would bring me so far. So that was a big reason for me to quit weed. 

Now I'm a month and a bit sober. And last week I heard from a colleague that there was another position open in the company. A job which I did want, but didn't really have the qualifications for. Still applied and I got the job! Not even a ""we will let you know next week"", just a ""we think you would be a great fit, welcome aboard!"" at the end of the interview. 

I'm so happy about that! But also kinda scared, because I know this is gonna be a challenge. On my way home I got some bad cravings. Because I was just too damn excited, but also scared. Intense feelings that I instinctively wanted to numb. To ""reward"" myself for doing a good job.

But no, I won't. I got this job because I stayed sober in the first place. Because I wanted something and because I took a gamble and did my best. And I know I need to stay sober to make this job a success. This job comes with a lot of responsibility and I will need to learn an entire new set of skills. But I will stay sober and make it a succes!

Have used it for 10+ years everyday. Last year it was getting extreme, I was high 24/7. The moment I woke up I smoked one and ended the day with one right before bed too. 
At the end, I hated smoking. When I was stoned I only tought about quiting, and when I was sober I only tought about getting high... 

It's going great, craving a bit at night but I can eat normally and no headaches. But I just can't sleep... I slept 1 hour each night the past 3 days. I am active in the day. Nothing helps. I just want a good night of sleep. My body needs it

I've been smoking for about 10 years now, started at 16. At the time it was some joint shared with friends, then I started only seeing my pothead friends and my consumption only got up from this.

Lost many friends alongside the road, and so much time. 

I feel like I will never be able to stop, my maximum is doing small breaks like I'm doing now. And those breaks are getting shorter and shorter. I haven't done 4 days for a while now, this is a record since the pandemic started... 

The hard thing is all my friends smoke like me, and the only way to not have a rechute is avoiding them. Then I get depress, because I don't see anyone. And of course, depressed mean I want to smoke. 

I want to smoke right now, but I won't. Not today.

Is it really one day at a time? Does it get easier if the break is long enough?",9,1

For the last, probably 2 years, I've wanted to take an extended break from weed. Like 3 months to see how I feel, and maybe even decide I don't want to smoke anymore.

I've attempted these ""breaks"" multiple times, but in all honesty haven't gone more than a week without smoking in the last 3 years. I feel like there's nothing I can do that will fill the void I have without weed, and even with weed I still feel like something's missing. I have a lot of hobbies like music production, gaming, and hiking. I have all these ideas of what I want to do when I get home, but once I actually get home, I feel like there's nothing to do besides dab and stare at my computer screen. I force myself to play a game or start a song every once in awhile, but it feels like I'm not doing enough. It always feels like I could be doing something better with my time. I can't play video games longer than 45 mins to an hour normally before I'm bored. I can't ever find the motivation to continue working on a song.

Has anyone else had this issue? With or without weed, there's a feeling of emptiness, but it feels like weed makes it more bearable despite it depriving me of my mental energy I could be using towards my hobbies. I want to be able to take a break but I haven't been able to power through the urges to stop at dispensaries, since they're everywhere. And when I'm sitting at home without weed, I start to get restless and I tend to pace around my apartment in a thought loop of trying to figure out what to do.

Are there any supplements/techniques that would help me not feel this need for weed? I take vitamins pretty regularly, and have heavily cut back on caffeine in the last month, replacing it with water, but can't get myself to stop, let alone cut back on weed. Regularly spending $60-$80 a week on dabs isn't financially smart or sustainable. Advice?",9,0

My last 9 or 10 attempts I didn’t even make it to day 2 before I caved. Hell, I don’t even think I’ve made it 12 hours by choice this entire time. Yesterday was the first time I ever truly just grit my teeth and made a commitment to myself to not fail.

Something is different this time...weed has just stopped working for me. What used to be a reprieve from my anxiety and insomnia has now become the root cause - and I’ve tried to ignore that shift for years but I’m too aware of it now to let it sit. I used to smoke to feel better and now I smoke to just not feel shitty. And even then it doesn’t really accomplish that anymore.

I’m not that guy that’s struggling in life as a result of smoking...I have a great job, a smart beautiful and caring wife, I’m fit, I own a nice home, a nice car and on and on. I should be beyond grateful for everything I have but tbh I’m not because deep down I think I’ve buried so much stuff under my habit that I don’t know how to be happy or grateful anymore - best case is usually that I just feel numb. 

I’ve told myself that it doesn’t matter that I have a low grade drug problem, that everyone has their vice and this just happens to be mine but “I’m doing ok so I shouldn’t take this one thing from myself.”

But holy fuck am I an anxious mess on the inside. I’ve been in a constant fog for a decade now and I’m ready to see what I can *really* do with my life. 

I want to *feel* my feelings good or bad. I want to be sharper to help put myself and my wife in a better position than we already are. I want to truly be present in every moment whether I’m bored or not. 

I’m fucking done - I don’t care if I don’t sleep for a few days. I don’t care if I don’t really “want” to eat for a few weeks. I’ll sweat my tits off and be shakey. None of the above is as bad as trudging through each day the way I have for years now.",9,0

Smoked one day and now Im 2 months smoking again. Lessons learned:,"1 - Quitting will be really hard on the first week. On the second too but after It its completely bearable.

2 - The thoughts of ""I NEED to smoke"" settle down pretty fast. About 3-5 days clean. Then ALL you have is a lingering thought but its not a CRAVING anymore.

3 - Stopping smoking weed wont miraculously solve ALL you problems. After a month of quitting I felt pretty normal but I still wasnt as productive as I wanted. 

You gotta form New habits and get rid of the bad ones you learned while smoking a shitton.

4 - The MIND. Thats where the battlefield occurs, and thats where you will notice the first changes. 

I feel paranoid, insecure, powerless when I smoke weed. When Im not smoking Im not instantly perfect but Im much more assertive and sure of myself. 

5 - If you do relapse (don't), make It a one time thing. I was going strong, denied weed on multiple occasions but one day I was at a party and a 10 offered me some. Shit was smelling SO good and I denied, but when she offered again and I saw she was interested I took It.

Smoked on that saturday, than didnt smoke for 4 ir 5 days and felt ok. But the seed was already planted. ALL It took was a week or two and me buying some weed. Went right back into smoking ALL day.

6 - Its absolutely doable. Its HARD, but doable. And when you go through withdrawals you dont wanna go back to smoking again. If you do, like I did, you gotta pick yourself up and do It again. Thats what Im doing. Planning my day one again for this next monday. Tapering It down to a joint a day from today to sunday so I dont suffer so much from withdrawals. Ill be reporting back.

First of all, I apologize myself for my english, as Im not a native speaker. I have been trying to quit ganja from a long time. The reason I want to do it is, first of all, because of spiritual aims and beliefs, and second, because I really believe being sober enables me to experience life as it should really be. Ganja seems to remove my anxiety, but removes my logical thinking, concentration, and even my personality and feelings.
I have been smoking weed for almost 10 years, and although I have been able to quit 3 times (tm: sober for more than 1 month), I always come back. Everytime I quit, I use a journal where I write down how I feel. Thats why I understand how Im supposed to feel after one day of non smoking, two days, one week...

1. The first time I realized, that just taking one hit from a spliff is enough to make me addicted again. 

2. The second time, I realized that after a couple weeks, or even days of non smoking, I always happen to say to myself ""Hey, you made it bro, you can control this, lets burn a big one as a reward""

3. This third time, I realized that in order to completely quit,I have to severe my connection with most friends. Im 27 years old now, and I've just realised I consider them loosers, and after that, I realized Im not different from them! I dont want to be a slave to nobody, not even to my own anxiety and spontaneus desires.

Sometimes I think its going to be harder this time, as I have to sell pot in order to pay for my masters degree. That means I have lots of weed in my house.

What has helped me the most is to train my force of will, pray to God an cut any remaining link with weed smokers and alcohol drinkers. I have no problems with alcohol, but Im starting to feel that hanging with people  whose amusement is based on drinking, eating or smoking won't take me happy neither, even if me myself I dont take parte in any of those activities.

As experience is only useful to others, I will keep posting my progress or recess.

""If you relapse, make it a one time thing""

Lately I’ve realized how worsening my life has become because of weed; and I realize how sad I make my family because of that, realizing family to me is what truly matters and I find it not worth smoking. I started at 16y from my friends party and now I’m 17y, so I’d rather quit now then try later. Recently I dropped and left so many friends (on a good note) because of how toxic they were to me and how they incouraged smoking; I know how bad it’s become, once was an anxiety relief to now the anxiety CAUSER. I tried quitting before and I’ve seen how bettered my life had become (physically and relationship wise) I’m throwing away every little bit of weed out and I’m gonna try my best. Wish me luck y’all and goodluck to anyone trying as well :)",3,0

This feels therapeutic to get it all out before I try to quit and get myself and my life back.

Smoked since I was 17/18, just for fun with friends at first but slowly I drifted into smoking alone, depression and isolation. Throughout my twenties I have made numerous  attempts to better my life, all which have failed. This only pushed me further into depression and using weed to cope. I reached such a state at one point that I couldn't afford a bar of soap, would go days without eating or washing. I remember a day, walking to the job centre in the rain, feet piss wet through because my shoes were full of holes, hungry, dirty and depressed. I rang my family when I got home that day and told them I didn't want to be here anymore and I couldn't take it. When they showed up believe it or not they had nothing to say, both my brothers said ""woe is me"" and that was it. My parents told me to come home but i just continued to spiral downward. I never want to go back to that time but if I don't fix things I will fall back to that.

The only person I had who truly supported me and was there for me in my life was my sister. At 24 I found her dead after she committed suicide. This broke me into a thousand pieces and I haven't been the same since. Of course I smoked as much as I could everyday just to sleep, just so I didn't relive opening that door and finding her every night.

Since then I have just drifted through life, stagnated, life has just passed me by as I smoked the years away. So here I am at 28m with nothing except weed. Living paycheck to paycheck in a job I hate, no social life, non existent sex life in my 20s, I've pushed all my friends away and the rest of my family has given up on me.

I have a lot of work to do.

I know I am better than this, I know I have more to give and that life has so much more to offer than being high alone in a dark room. I really need to take action otherwise I will just descend further and further and before I know it I will be 38 and writing this same post.

Sorry about the rant but I wanted to just get it all out. Maybe if someone can relate to even a sentence of what I have said then they won't feel so alone, I don't know but I know the guys and gals in this community are angels and you are helping a lot of people find the strength to try and get better. Before I start I would like to say thank you for giving me the hope that I can get better.

Stay Safe & Thank You",10,0

I've been using and abusing marijuana since I was 15 years old, and I'm 25 now, so that's 10 years inside the abusive relationship that is marijuana-addiction.

The early days were hard as fuck; sleepless nights, major anxiety and just an utter lack of awareness of who I was or what I wanted out of life. I found that after a month, I stopped visiting here as much because I spent a lot more time on r/stopdrinking, which I'm happy to say helped a lot, as I am also officially 2 months sober from alcohol. 

Now that I feel like I'm officially part of some \*sobriety club\*, I just gotta say that life is hard right now. I still find it near impossible to get any work done and I feel shitty a lot of the time, BUT I feel shitty with a clear head and I can confront and improve on the issues I'm noticing in myself instead of living my life inside of a cloud and pretending they don't exist. 

It's so easy to find myself drifting to the idea that a joint would take away the anxieties and doubts I feel, and I have no doubt that they would for a brief moment. After all my experience being sober and relapsing though, I know that it would replace those anxieties and doubts with something much worse.

For anyone just starting, it gets a whole lot better. Not easier per se, but better. For anyone with a long streak under their belt, you're absolutely amazing and an inspiration to me and I'm sure many others. I will not smoke with any of you today! Peace and love everyone, take care.",68,0

I'm not the type of person to ask someone to change their life around for my own personal benefit and I don't want to seem demanding, however my partner is aware of my past with ED and how hard it is for me to lose weight, as well as how hard I exercise (and keep getting in my own way) 

He works really hard and weed helps him get an uninterrupted night's sleep.
On the days when he's off work we'll usually smoke pretty much the whole day and get nothing done.
Partially it's my fault bc I know he won't say no and I'm at the point now where I'll take any opportunity to smoke just to have an excuse to binge. Tomorrow I usually wake up with horrible cramps, bloated and fkn sad. 
Having grown up with addicts in my immediate family, I've started to recognise this behaviour as a beginning of mental dependance/addiction. 

I don't want to take away from him the benefits that he gets from smoking but at the same time I don't know how to help myself. I'm stuck in a cycle, stuck at home and at the moment weed gives me an opportunity to make the mundane look more fun. I can't even have any around me without being temped to smoke ""just bc"", literally nothing matters other than not being bored for a short while and eating my face off. 

Everytime we run out of weed, we'll agree to take a break, and I'll go (inside my mind) Phew, finally I can go back to eating normally again and hopefully/finally lose some of this munchie weight... And then the weekend comes and we're back to square one.
I tried in the past to not smoke when he does and it led to a feeling of resentment towards him for having fun when ""I'm not allowed to"". Which in my opinion is really toxic and not fair to him. 

However, I wasn't always like this. I've been a casual smoker for years and it's never had such a strong hold on me before the pandemic hit. I'd usually smoke outside with friends and never really had the budget to go crazy on takeout and snacks. It's like when I smoke all common sense just disappears. 

I'm desperate and sad, I recently had to go up in clothing size, my lungs hurt and pinch in random spots, I feel super congested... 

How do I condition myself to put my fitness/health goals first and become uninterested in smoking? 
I've quit tobacco 6 yrs ago after years of being a heavy smoker to start a gym program, I don't understand why is weed so hard to drop as well. 

I apologise for the lengthy ramble and I appreciate any advice you can give 🌻

Take the most relaxed approach you possibly can. If it doesn’t feel like it can happen quite yet then don’t quit. Trust your gut. There’s no point in making it stressful if it doesn’t have to be.

Temptation is there and it’s starting to seem like it will always be there and it’s an unfortunate side effect at this point. Accepting that fact is hard but very much possible.

People might be jealous. Let them!

Out of sight, out of mind. The only thing that reminds me is this subreddit and I’ve had to leave it more than once in the past.

I’ve been toking for a little over 13 years (11 of those years flower, the past 2 years wax). It has become a chore; it’s mentally exhausting, my anxiety is through the roof, and I’m constantly depleted and tired. 

I used to be so mentally dependent and addicted to weed that I would feel the need to smoke before doing ANYTHING (be it big or small), but I worked hard on changing my approach and I was able to cut back a great deal.

I am a huge movie/television fan. I go to the theater all of the time, at least two or three times a week, because I’m obsessed with film. 

Smoking weed and being high has always been a big part of watching movies and television for me, and I find it incredibly hard to not be high while doing those activities. 

I’m embarrassed because I feel like I can lay weed down for good, if it weren’t for this intense desire to smoke before watching a movie or TV episodes. 

I don’t want to give up my passion and hobby, but I can’t keep falling into the relapse trap.

This post will serve as a warning for those smoking excessively and motivation for those on their journey of quitting. Treat me as a case study but recognize how much you might see yourself in my story.

TLDR: Weed addiction heighted to unimaginable levels once my life became extremely stressful. I fell into a cycle of binging bad habits and now am left with possible permanent brain damage.

I have since decided to quit smoking weed for good, but I would not have done it if my body didn't force me to. I have been smoking for 7 years. It started up and continued like you would expect. My monthly habit led to a weekend habit which led to a daily habit which at my worst led to me being high 24/7.

I was always able to be productive with weed and am someone you would consider ""successful"". Even with a daily habit, I would keep it to nights such that I could achieve what I needed in the day. This productive weed-smoking narrative I told myself fell apart in January. I began to experience extreme stress. I was constantly running away from thoughts I hated and could not handle the anxieties of managing my life, especially as the weed use grew. I dived heavily into porn and video games at the time as well because once you start running away from one truth (which was that I needed to change my life dramatically in many ways), you fall down the slope of self destruction. Eventually, masturbation and video games became completely tied with smoking weed as to maximize the dopamine flight.

As time grew on and my tolerance inflated, I would end up having to smoke almost 24/7. I forgot what it was like to feel sober or not constantly crave weed as the source and entryway into everything I enjoyed. I isolated myself from everyone, and became desperately suicidal and depressed.

Eventually, the more obvious warning signs came. I began to have trouble getting hard when sober, and my porn addiction had created so much insecurity and anxiety around sex that I lost all sex drive. When I could get hard, I would come instantly, and I would feel neurologically numb the entire time. My rock bottom came when I experienced the shit end of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. It was traumatic and reminded me of the time I had a terrible hallucinogenic trip where I believed I was completely powerless and dying. Luckily, I powered through without smoking because I knew smoking would only make it worse down the road.

After that, I decided to quit for a while because it was necessary. It was the following week that I realized how actually fucked up my brain had become. Before the event, I was suicidal; but after temporarily quitting, suicide was literally the only thing I could think about. If you had handed me a shotgun during this time, I would've ended my life in a heartbeat. I would barely move, and would get lost in thought fantasizing about my own death. My brain did not know how to do anything if it wasn't fueled by weed. The only other option was death.

After a couple weeks, clarity came. My precious dick would magically be refilled with vigor, and my insecurities waned. I did not address the root of my anxiety though; and eventually, I fell back in. Like a returning addict to anything, I continued at a similar rate I had when I stopped even despite my lowered tolerance. Even after the first toke, it again became all I could yearn for and was constantly on my mind. This use continued for two weeks, but I could not remain ignorant any longer.  Last week, I decided to recognize my anxiety, and commit to quitting weed for good. The past week has been a similar mental repeat to my last initial break from weed, and my dick again has lost its energy. I'm optimistic; but for all I know, I could be impotent for the rest of my life because I didn't know when to stop. This result has shown me that my brain is corroded in many ways possibly beyond repair.

As cannabis addicts, we must recognize that the genetic enhancements and lack of research around the drug make us the test subjects. The narrative that this drug is harmless is propaganda in the same way as the narrative that it is inherently evil. Some people can control their use as I did for many years, but eventually I had to hit a wall when life changed for the worse. A year ago, I would've told you that I did not have a problem with weed, just a casual addiction similar to caffeine.

If you've read this far, I hope you can learn from my story and not repeat my same mistakes. Thank you.",11,0

I've been posting on here pretty much during all of my journey from quitting three years ago to relapsing at the start of the pandemic and then quitting again a year ago (almost).

I've started to relapse about two months ago. I really haven't smoked that much at all during that time but enough to make me feel like maybe I was missing out on something and should have a just a little more.

I just came back from holidays at my mum's in France where I started to quit again, now I am back home and getring tempted. 

My life has improved so much since I quit, 3 years ago and even though I've had a relapse or two I am still convinced that quitting was one of the best decisions I made in my life. It feels odd that I'm going to be celebrating one year sober and at the same time I know that I 'cheated' and I'm getting the temptation again. 

I am one month away from starting a bachelor in jewellery and accessory design/making at uni and everything is going well. I think maybe it's the pressure of everything I have to do that makes me want to try and escape. I don't want to fuck it up!

Life is definitely much different now but still have much to do.

So, I no longer have panic attacks. I had to stop drinking coffee for that to fully happen as well. I have been going to the gym 4-5 days a week and am down over 20 lbs. I’m a stand up comedian and have been doing it on and off for years. Now I am fully back to doing it multiple times a week. It has really restored a feeling of purpose/fullness in my life that was missing. My goals are always on my mind, I have the drive to do what I know I must. I’m a much more responsible adult now than I was 4 months ago. I also have a girl in my life now who is really into me. Finally at 25, life is definitely progressing the way it always should have for me. The way it should for all of us.

I still get depressed sometimes, still get angry, still feel tired, numb and a little spacey too. Hopefully those things start to even out more as the months go on. 

If I can do this so can you. I was smoking anywhere from 3-6 times a day and drinking every night with dinner. Good luck everyone just sharing my progress!",56,0

I have been a daily smoker for about a year and a half, and started smoking at 16/17. Smoking was never a problem for me when I was younger, because I never had my own supply. Once I started buying my own however, it was easier to justify smoking more frequently. Since I started smoking daily I have noticed a steady decline in my functioning and my aspirations have dwindled. I have always chalked this lack of motivation/drive to COVID due to the overlap in my smoking habits and the pandemic. I blissfully ignored the role that weed played. 

I have a few core motivations for quitting: 

* I want to work towards a career where I can help others (and I gotta help myself first and foremost).
* I no longer have ""being a college student"" as an excuse to be a mega-stoner since I finished up classes in the Spring. 
* One of my siblings is going to have kids soon, and with all the rug-rats that are going to be popped out I want to be the best me possible to make sure I can help those kids have a better life than we did growing up. Especially since I don't plan to have kids myself.

I know this journey is going to be hard, but I am determined to recover my past self. My girlfriend and I are doing this together so I am grateful for our shared suffering and for the motivation I have gotten from reading the posts on this sub.

If you’re consuming weed on a daily basis, convinced it is benefiting you, but there are subtle or obvious signs that it’s not, don’t ignore the signs. There is an enhanced, better version of you inside that can be brought about and I’m an absolute living example of it – and if you’d told me this a year or so ago, I would have laughed in your face and said you were high.

But after nearly 24 years of daily marijuana use/abuse, I ended my addiction to it on 8/10/20 (I’m 42yo). So today is one year fully sober for me, having also quit alcohol on 2/8/20, which somehow has been easier than letting go of my constant companion, cannabis. I was your typical high functioning addict, able to maintain a well-paying engineering job, and also be a ""good"" father and husband, at least in confines of my own distorted perception. Which, as many of you surely know, is fuel to the fire of addiction – “I can handle this! I make good money, have a nice house, and a beautiful family who loves me! I just use this drug to unwind/expand my consciousness/control my anxiety! Look at all these daily functions I can perform \*just fine\* while high!” Yeahhhhh. But not so much, right?

When you’re under the spell of daily use/abuse, these are the lies we tell ourselves to keep the monkey on our back. Anyway, I wanted this post, which is my first one on r/leaves, to be an inspiration to others. I nearly lost my family last year after spiraling out of control through the lockdowns. My usage skyrocketed and had a severe effect on my mental well-being – my irritability, patience, overall stability, my work output/relationships, everything.  I was high all the time and it was doing no good to anyone. After a bout of “social anxiety” that led me to essentially skipping my then 5yo daughter’s birthday party (such as it was last year during the pandemic), my wife nearly left me. My family hung in the balance as I struggled to accept that after all the “work” I’d done to improve my mental well-being, there was one more thing I hadn’t tried – quitting weed. Not cutting back, which I could never effectively do, but letting it go completely and seeing if maybe, maybe, it was at the root of all the problems I’d created in this family over the last 6 years. Give all my herb away, all my devices, everything, and start over with true sobriety. The last card on the table. “Turn that motherfucker over and see where it goes, pal – you’ve put it off long enough.”

With the help of some support groups – one meeting with M.A. then on to S.M.A.R.T. which was much more preferable for me – I found the strength to see this through and embrace total sobriety, not merely give up weed. The first weeks were tough, yes, as the THC left my system. I didn’t have cravings, per se, just had to flush out my system and go through that process. I became physically active again, and finally stuck with it so that at this point I’ve lost about 40lbs of fat, put on decent muscle mass, and started running, biking, and using the elliptical regularly. No more sneaking around and being at my very essence a dishonest broker with the daily effort to manage/conceal my addiction. As the weeks and months passed, my family noticed that I’d truly transformed into a much better version of myself. I was no longer irritable and impatient, I was able to be more present and listen attentively more reliably, and there were no more eggshells for my wife and two daughters to walk around in my presence.

It took some time, but gradually, after the very real prospect of divorce and family separation, my wife’s love for and trust in me reached its former level, and then surpassed it, reaching a place I never imagined possible. In time, my 15yo daughter followed suit, which has been so rewarding that I simply can’t express the depths of my gratitude for having embraced this journey. Our relationship had been seriously damaged from my addiction, and now we’re in a place I couldn’t have hoped for. She tells me she loves me without it feeling awkward, she shares with me her hopes and dreams, fears and concerns, and I’m always there for her, and she understands that I’ve put serious work into this effort. Her appreciation for it keeps me going strong, as well of my wife’s, of course.

So here I am, one year in, with no thoughts of going back. This is the one-year marker of the rest of my life – no more mind-altering substances, ever. I spent over two decades with this internal cynic/critic always in the background, questioning and critiquing my every thought, action, and sense. Distorting my perceptions, straining my relationships, and contributing to the very “ills” that I convinced myself that my usage was treating (depression, anxiety, etc). With the clarity of sobriety, I’m amazed it took me so long to leave this abusive relationship behind, and become the man my family needed me to become, and who indeed I needed myself to become. The benefits I’ve reaped have been so worth the effort – my memory is crisper than ever (but not perfect! Not sure if it’ll ever get back to a true baseline), my work output is better than ever before, my ability to handle conflict, large and small, is just astronomically improved. And what did I lose? Daily doses of artificial euphoria/relaxation? A near-schizophrenic state of daily living where once I’m high, I look and think about everything with a distorted lens that tricks me into thinking that weed is augmenting my life in some meaningful way? Nah. Those aren’t losses. Those were the chains keeping the monkey to my back.

You can do this too. You can quit cold turkey, throw/give all your wares and herb away, and begin a new life of clarity. Repair yourself and your relationships. I used to do nearly everything while high – I brought my vape with me everywhere I went, even on plane trips, always with the airtight containers to conceal the smell, which was not always effective. Going to the store? Get high on the way. Picking up my daughter from daycare? I can fit in a toke on the way. Roadtrip? Oh damn, time for edibles. I mean, shit, I even brought weed into the Philippines on my honeymoon to sustain my addiction, which could have led to a very, very bad outcome…but I got away with it. Just like I thought I was “getting away with it” all those years of daily use/abuse. But I wasn’t. It all caught up with me and if I hadn’t chosen this path, I would absolutely be a single guy sharing custody of my two daughters with a sensible woman who had every reason to leave me.

So that’s all I’ve got. The opening quote is from a poem I wrote on my last morning of this addiction. I was camping in the Adirondacks, watching my morning fire burn, and I was inspired to write a poem, which I hadn’t done in a very long time. It flowed out of me, and while the irony is not lost on me that I was high during its composition, I am very proud of it, and think it was a major component of me moving forward into this effort with every fiber of my being. I would gladly share the rest of it, if there are any requests to see it, but didn’t want this post to spiral too far out of control!

I have smoked daily for 15+ years. I knew I need to quit - to have a family, to get rid of addiction, to rediscover sober myself. As I remember it now, first 2-3 weeks were hard, but I managed not to smoke single joint. Then something changed in my mind and I woke up one morning knowing I dont need weed anymore and I will never smoke again. It was easy since this realization - I think the excess THC finally left my body and mind and lost control over me. From time to time, I have a dream when I smoke, but that is all. No urges, no melancholic memories... I had a lot of anxiety while smoking weed, but since I quit these moods/emotions dissapeard. It's ironic - You think the weed is helping you manage anxieties, but in fact it is the reason You have it - that's my experience. 

I have no regrets for quitting. But I have regrets that I did not do it sooner. I have lost so many years living a ""half-life"", setteling for little and not trying to achieve more. It wasn't even that hard to quit (it's much harder to think about quitting than really quitt). Unfortunately, the weed has the power to convince you that life will not be fun without it. But the opposite is true. You can't live life to the fullest if you're addicted.

My message to you is - try to quit until you succeed. Don't let the weed win. I guarantee you that after a few sober weeks you will find that life is much more colorful, stimulating and cheerful than the smoke-covered reality. Good Luck to all.",359,0

With me it was more about experiencing everything weed has to offer. I had previously quit for about 7 months with the help of this sub (Thank you). 

Then my city (Still illegal) got flooded with Cali packs and I felt as if I was missing out on something and wanted to see what was so special about this Cali. 

After I convinced myself and justified smoking it again I got stuck smoking daily for months.

Cali is better than what’s available on the streets but after a while it looses its effects and goes back to that normal comfortable high that I was just so used to.

Weed has a major impact on my sleep and energy levels especially since I was a night smoker, just before bed kinda thing. 

I’ve recently got back into the gym again. I’ve done about a month so far, of 4 to 5 days a week. Mainly 4 because I struggle to hit legs twice a week 🤦‍♂️. 

Because of my smoking, I’ve noticed it’s getting increasingly difficult to get my ass to the gym, cause I’d rather go straight home and light up. Also the low energy levels didn’t help either.

It was also a time pass and something I would do in my own time by myself. It used to be going out and smoking with friends daily but we’ve all kinda grown apart and moved on as our lives have become busier. So my routine turned into getting home, putting a movie on, light up and then knockout. Repeat the next day. 

All in all, I think I’m finally done with this thing. I feel like I’ve experienced everything it has to offer and I’m finished.

I’m also surrounded by smokers on a daily basis and I find it easy to say no when others offer it up, I don’t find myself craving it. I believe this is due to my previous attempts at quitting.

I almost smoked when I was with my partner who is still smoking daily, I had a few beers thought ah its 30 days why not, I really felt like it.

Need to be more aware of the craving or how easy it would be to just have a little drag. But I gave it back and walked away weed free. 

The only time Ive been sober in the last 10 years is on a 21 day trip to Scotland in 2019. Smoking daily with my husband and I have been carrying on about wanting to stop for a few years. Im damn proud of myself, I remember trying to stay sober for just one day about 3 years ago it was the hardest day ever. I tried Sober October in 2019 and ended up picking up my nicotine addiction again after being quit for 3 years. I had to go through the quitting stages all over again.  

A periodontal dental disease diagnosis last year October gave me a solid kick in the ass to actually do something drastic about my smoking and I was off weed for two weeks and then slide back into just smoking a joint or so a day. Get back on the wagon get sober again for a week or two and end up smoking again. Like  vicious cycle! 

Ive promised myself I am quitting weed and I want to get to 365 days weed free. 

I dunno I just want to get this out, Im both seriously proud of this milestone after 10 years being in the haze but also disappointed in myself for even taking the joint and trying to get a drag out.

for some background, i've struggled with depression since i was about 13 years old, and i am 20 now. it worsened significantly when i started college and became nearly unmanageable my sophomore year. after dealing with a lot of internal conflict, i finally decided i would seek help for the first time. i started taking an anti-depressant in june and began seeing a therapist- both of which have helped so far. at least, helped enough to the point where i think i want to make positive changes in my life and may be able to make those changes. but, i feel like that's easy for me to say now, because i'm living comfortably at home and far away from my college town (which sucks the life and happiness out of me completely). i don't smoke at home because i live with my parents and don't really feel the need (perhaps because my mental state improves when I'm home, but I'm not sure), but i do not feel the same way in my college town at all.

weed doesn't really do anything for me now except encourage binge-eating (which i'm working on with another medication- i have a pretty poor relationship with food and the binge eating brought on by constant smoking has resulted in me being the heaviest i've ever been, causing an onslaught of other issues), interfere with my sleep, cause me to have anxiety and bad paranoia (which i'm also currently being medicated for) and in general, make my depression worse. it is so much easier for me to slip into my depressive and suicidal thought-loop when i'm high, for example. i still get high, but it's not what i would call pleasant or euphoric, like it used to be when i was 17. sometimes i get so high i feel totally paralyzed and i don't know exactly how to describe it but i enter a really disturbing headspace and there's,,, no possible way that it's good for my mental or even physical health.

this is really only the tip of the ""why smoking weed fucks me up"" iceberg and i know giving it up is an obvious solution to a lot of the issues i am experiencing but i'm so hesitant and scared to quit just because of the few pleasant things it provides for me, i.e. maybe an hour of music sounding better or a meal tasting better. i can be suicidal as shit but knowing that i get to smoke a joint later gives me something to look forward to, even if it makes me feel like utter garbage physically and mentally. i depended heavily on these moments because they were the only time i felt even the slightest bit of happiness (though it never lasts).

therein lies the problem: i've started making moves to improve my quality of life (therapy, medication) and while i feel somewhat better, i'm afraid it won't last. basically, i have a sense of impending doom because i return to my college town in less than a week now, and i know that if things get bad again i'll want to smoke, which will make things even worse, and then i'm right back where i started and all potential for improvement is lost. i feel hopeless and could use some encouragement. weed has such a strong grip on me mentally and i'm worried i won't be able to handle managing my mental illness sober, though there's no chance of me doing so if i'm high.",7,0

Long time lurker, second-time poster here. Really appreciate this community. Been wrestling with overcoming my addiction since April and this place has been a huge help. 

I’m noticing that when I relapse, I feel a strange slightly uncomfortable tingly/buzzy sensation through my body, especially down my arms, the day after I get high. It kinda feels like my body is calling out for something it lacks. It usually lasts strongest for the first 18-24 hours, and it’s usually accompanied by a craving to get high again. 

I’m no scientist lol but my intuition is telling me this is my body’s endocannibanoid system or whatever thrown all out of whack, because it was in the process of rewiring itself to manufacture its pleasure and reward chemicals the natural way, and now in my relapse I’ve confused it by re-introducing the THC it was learning to live without.

Has anyone else felt this? Am I right about why it might be happening? Is it psychosomatic?

P.S.- if you’re struggling with relapse, like I am, don’t beat yourself up too hard. Sometimes falling a bit is part of the process of rising. We’re on the right track and we got this :)",2,0

Had a really great weekend, in terms of mindset and productivity. Recovering from a relapse of only 2 months, but was harder than expected to step back from daily use.

After loads of irritability and a fair amount of... things feeling a little boring / colorless, I've been on a good trajectory since Friday. Got a ton of stuff done at work on Friday (had NO MEETINGS for a whole day). Saturday hit a church yard sale with my husband, we did a quick house clean-up (neither of us are naturally tidy people), then I worked for about 4 hours on a story for an anthology call that had a deadline of Sunday. Sunday, worked another couple hours on my story, ran some errands, came home, revised story and submitted, cleaned the fridge, and made dinner. 

I realize that the above probably sounds SO FREAKING BORING to all you 20-somethings out there, but this feels great to me compared to the neglect everything in my house falls under when I am using. So, MY things might be boring, but insert the fun stuff y'all wish you were doing instead!

All while working with one of cats who has been peeing outside of her litter box, so I'm keeping her separate in a room and hanging out with her in my bathroom which has TWO litterboxes so she can choose which kind of litter she prefers. And she's so grateful -- I hadn't realized how stressed she has been between my other bully cat and my son who's home from college who stomps around and is a little obnoxious with them. Again, a lot of detail, but it's the kind of disciplined work that I don't do when I'm stoned.

Also, a note about the writing details. I actually find writing types kind of annoying when they post writing updates on social media or constantly talk about it, so I usually keep it to myself, but in this case it's relevant because it's the thing I most want to be doing. I've been working on getting the discipline to do it together for 3 years now (after NOT doing stuff for a 15+ years of using, drinking, etc.). Wasn't doing it at all for the last 2 months. And I'm too old to just throw away 2 or 3 months for a momentary buzz that pretty soon starts to feel crappy anyhow.

So, for the above, replace ""writing"" with whatever fantastic thing you do that makes your life more beautiful, meaningful, and worthwhile, whether that's music, crafting, making a gorgeous meal, connecting with your friends and community, exercise, filming epic gameplay videos, whatever. 

Anyhow, sure I will dip back down out of my current pink cloud, BUT the fact is that sobriety gives us so many benefits that it's often it's own motivation, we just need to guard against the times that an urge sneaks up on us, but if we weather those we realize they are very short-lived.",2,0

Went back home the next morning, and had a good day. Still meal prepped for the week, and made it through the whole day without smoking at all. Today I had an amazing workout at the gym and plan on reading a self help book I got myself before bed tonight.

I (20,M)started smoking 4 years ago and been smoking non stop (not counting the breaks) but it was only recently that it clicked in my head and i realised that i cant keep living like this. Its not even that much about the effects and addiction. I've had periods were i was more or less smoking a joint every hour (dont ask me how i paid for this as a student, I dont have a clue myself) but since last year i've got that problem under control and was only smoking at nights just so i had a bit of time for myself, and of course i smoked in order to fall asleep which was the sole reason i started. Where i live,however, it isnt legal to smoke and me still being a student i just cant handle all the stress and paranoia of just the fact that if i get busted, i could loose stuff like my drivers license even though i just smoke at home and dont drive afterwards. I realised that its just not worth it and even though it feels good to smoke, it feels even better to live life knowing that you dont have to be careful everytime i drive because one suspicious cop could ruin my life (theoretically they still could but thats not the point).

6 years ago,
I Started smoking and now that I look back I can clearly see how I slowly lost my passion I got into a deep pit by 2-3 year that was failing in college,losing interest in doing anything, choosing wrong emotions basically killing myself slowly 

2020 I lost my love my lovely doggo and I had no option but to face my life, my depression and the chronic illnesses I had developed on the way. I.e hair loss, piles, malnourishment, depression, anxiety, stomach issues, bad teeth and some more

I realised I couldn't run any longer and it was time to face my fears.
Meditation helped me alot and life started getting better

2021 
I am finally a graduate
Thanks to my weed addiction it took me 5 years to graduate
I had an online business which was making money for me even when I was on the lows I started it when I was 16 .
I used to do a lot of creative things as a kid and this business was one of them.
It's working and expanding now and I have created another website 
I have been on semen retention past 6 months on and off longest was 88 days 
My health is getting fine 
But,
I know it's time to take back the power that's still out there 
I am ready to face my weed addiction and quit once and for all .
I want a clear head where I can think, create and be at peace without the need of any substance.
I want the body that nolonger has to cough all the time
I do not want these stained teeth from all the smoking any more.

I no longer want to be stuck in these loops for I am meant to fly.
Weed is bullshit and it's time to seperate for good.

No weed means more time more health more quality kore fun 
I no longer need to hide my reath or run away from my family every now and then to take a smoke 
I want my family back.
And most importantly I want myself back.

I wanted to share a thought to help during withdrawals. 

For about 12 years (31YM) until recently, I have watched myself canoe through each day. Except, I always feel like I am hovering over myself steering. I float 2-3 feet above, watching myself. And guess what? 

I am always ready to take the L, resigned to the loss of the day. I think, hey, there is always tomorrow man, don't worry. Oscar Wilde used to say there was a luxury in self reproach, where by the time you really scold yourself you almost feel absolved. I was and am a professional at this. 

Turns out, being incredibly optimistic every day, thinking the haze will just lift tomorrow, kind of means that every day starts and ends the same way.

I started thinking that what I have to do, is push my floating self away away from the canoe. I must say: look, wherever I am, all of me must go. Enough with a half life. 

I also read one of the aims of education address from uchicago (the 2015 address). the following passage was illuminating:

""Now there’s nothing wrong with *wanting* to be one sort of beast as opposed to another, though of course it’s impossible to know what it’s truly like to be something *before* becoming it.  But even worse, focusing on wanting to *be* something, even through *doing*, is to lose the world, for it rips us from our own spatio-temporal existence.  

Always anticipating being *done* with whatever we are doing now seems a pretty depressing way of life, but that’s often our idea of education.  Wanting to be the sort of beast that *has had* certain types of experience means living life facing backwards, prematurely senescent, missing it all even when having it all.  It means facing one’s cell phone to take a picture of ‘me by the Grand Canyon’ so that (in the future) you can ‘remember when we were at the Grand Canyon,’ which means that you never *were* in the Canyon then, rather, then, you were in your phone, now.  We turn our back on experience, and thereby the world.

I’m not simply saying that you shouldn’t buy your jeans pre-faded and now even pre-torn, to make it seem as if you’ve had experience you haven’t.  I’m saying that when it comes to experience, and *especially* educative experience, thinking in terms *to have had*—living in the future perfect at the expense of the present—produces an inferior species of experience.  Because the problem with doing in order to be is that being *is* doing.  Doing exercises makes one…an exerciser.  Contrary to the implicit philosophy of the nautilus machine, there is nothing wrong with rowing and *looking* like a rower because you *are* a *rower*…and not looking like one if you aren’t. ""

&#x200B;

**Basically, constantly thinking that tomorrow will be the day doesn't prepare you to actually make the change. It just makes you really, really good at convincing yourself that today is not the day.** 

So throw the other you off the canoe, and live truly. Forget about imagining that one day you will change, because you are wasting days. Quit by quitting today. 

Proud of each of you. Love you.",27,0

A best friend would encourage me to go as far as I can in life not keep me couch locked and convince me it’s helping me with anxiety all whilst giving me paranoia. I feel like I’ve done myself a huge favour just letting it go. I don’t need it, I never have. I just don’t know why and how I managed to stay attached to it for a whole 3 years. I can finally experience the difference between my life when I’m just living, breathing and enjoying the present moment compared to these past three years where I’ve just shut everything out, forgot who I was, and numbed my emotions using drugs. 


By the way, I used to be one of thiose huge advocates like nooo it’s not harmful but let me tell you, it’s a drug. I don’t care what anyone else says, it’s not just some harmless plant, you will get hooked on it, see life through its rose coloured lenses and you’ll never be able to feel that same high unless you alter your brain chemistry and therefor alter your reality bc you’ll love it sm this feeling of escape whilst still being in the same place. If you’ve quit already, don’t reach for it no matter how many times you want to. If you are thinking of quitting but have something holding you back, keep fighting that feeling. This subreddit has taught me that you’ve come way too far just to COME THIS FAR. I’m serious, you are doing yourself a huge favour by letting this go, your body never needed this in its system. 

When you plant a garden and there’s weeds you take them out, don’t smoke that toxic sh*t. It’s a paradox, destroy your lungs for some momentary happiness that will eventually go away and you’ll keep chasing that feeling like a hamster on a wheel.

I know now that the main thing we addicts all have in common is that all we’re chasing is happiness; but it ain’t worth it if it’s false happiness. Besides, happiness is temporary. What we’re really after is joy… everlasting blissful joy, self fulfillment, love, a sense of belonging and most importantly comfort.

I’m gonna leave you all with this final note. Ask your heart what it needs to live a life filled with passion and playfulness. It’s time to let go of this unhealthy habit that does nothing to serve your higher purpose and it’s time to start taking the steps you need to put yourself  in the right direction to following your heart, your ambitions, to go after you goals fearlessly, to help others that are struggling like you used to, and to confront any and everything life throws at you. You’ve got this, I promise. Just believe in yourself, there’s nothing you can’t do when you set your mind to it.",11,0

I am experiencing extreme exhaustion and fatigue which is the biggest issue I’ve noticed since quitting. 

In the past whenever I was forced to quit whether on a vacation or something the insomnia was extreme. I feel I am facing an opposite affect. I am writing this in the middle of my work day, I am noticing extreme crash in concentration and focus after my first 2 hours of intense work.

1122,2021-08-09 11:01:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p136t9/day_2/,day 2,"23(F). I started toking when I was 18 in freshman year of college and I guess all throughout my college years, it became my personality trait. Everyone knew me as a pothead and I honestly had no problem with it. In fact, I even embraced it and I was always down to smoke anyone out. It got to a point where it was mary jane before anyone else. I started becoming flaky, skipped classes just to smoke and toked before every meal. The only personality trait my friends and I had were smoking too and we would eat really unhealthy meals late at night. Whenever I was out doing an activity, I would think to myself on how great it would be if I had a doobie. I still graduated on time at 21 but there was so much more I could have done with my life. Anyway fast forward to when I was 22, I had to move to another country. Since it was kinda hard to get the devil’s lettuce here, I had to force myself to quit for 2 months because I found an edible plug for a bit. I also gained 15lbs ever since covid started and I was genuinely the heaviest and unhappiest I had ever been my entire life because I no longer had my bandaid to cover the wound of how sucky my life was at the moment. 

Now that I think about it, those 2 months felt like the longest ever and the mood swings and irritability I had to experience were insane. I would just lash out at my parents all the time. And because I truly had no other options, I got into working out, meditating and journaling and my journey towards self improvement begun. I got to really take a look at myself, reflect and process all the shitty things that I have done. 

(Side note: I’ve lost 15lbs since then and my anxiety is way under control now. I’ve also managed to turn meditating and journaling into a habit of mine which I never thought I would or could.)

Okay back to the story:

A couple months later, I met my boyfriend but that didn’t last too long and we broke up. And funnily enough, I found a flower plug around the same time and it became really easily accessible to me. So of course I started toking my life away yet again basking in the glory of that euphoric high. It was the best thing ever especially after a shitty day at work and it helped me fade out the pain of the breakup especially when I was rolling a j for some reason. Literally 2 weeks later, my city went into lockdown and both my parents got covid while so many people were dropping dead like flies because of the new delta variant. And obviously because I was home, I was forced to process my breakup and miss mary jane was my only coping mechanism dealing with both the breakup and my parents getting covid. Luckily my parents have recovered but being an only child, it was really crazy having to deal with it all. 

But ever since my parents’ recovery, I noticed that I have become extremely lazy. I went from waking up at 6am everyday to waking up around 11:30am. It’s been so hard for me to do anything at all. I just mindlessly scroll on my phone and lie in bed all day. I ran out of it two days ago and I told myself I would quit because I am starting to become dependent on it once again. Let’s be real because w33d feels amazing in the moment but long term effects are not worth it. I’m on day 2 right now and man I am ITCHING to text my plug for more. But no, I must be strong and I have to remind myself of what taking that path had led me to before. I still have a bright whole future ahead of me and I’m not going to let some plant take over it AGAIN!! I definitely need to find new coping mechanisms.

Geez, I felt like I just explained my entire life story but I’m so glad I found this sub because typing this out really helped me set my priorities straight. If you made it this far, thank you. I hope we all get through this and get to make the most of our lives without it.",2,4

Came home; cut the grass. Hung out with my wife and kid. Just a few sundays ago id have ripped a bowl with my morning coffee. But not now - i got to be present and checked in.

My daughter loves going to see the local minor league baseball team play. It’s an awesome family  atmosphere. Yesterday was kids day, pirates and princesses. She got to dress up in a tutu. We ate pizza and hot dogs . Her cousins came too.

She loves the mascot but is terrified of him in person bc he’s huge. Our team won in the 10th with a walkoff shot into right field. The players stormed the field. Then the team hosted the ‘running of the kids’ and the all the kids got to run the bases. It was awesome. I took my niece and daughter out on the field, 2 and 3 years old. The light was amazing. The girls ran their hearts out. I think it was the highlight of the summer. So much love and joy and just full smiles.

When we got to the car tears were welling up in my eyes. I was so proud and happy. The girls were singing together and reliving the moment. I was so grateful to get to be a Dad and an Uncle. So proud. And doing it sober was incredible. I got to be fully in the moment. Still on cloud 9.",5,0

It's so deep rooted in my mind that I only feel motivated, inspired, and only have creative ideas when I'm blazed and also hitting my nicotine vape in between recording and producing sessions.

I've made probably 100s of unreleased songs but every single of them I made stoned. I don't know how to make music sober.

I just met some more friends who actually have an incredible talent with music and that shocked me. But we all smoke and it gets us in the zone so much, I don't know how to stop.

I also get terribly depressed when sitting around home all day not smoking.

Music is the most important thing to me in my whole life basically. Does your music get better after quitting? 

Because I keep being afraid my music will NEVER Be on the level it's at again without smoking for that blast of creativity. 

Somehow I always feel trapped in my situation, like it's so rooted into my life that quitting will just turn me into a bland stale shell of a person and ruin my talents and creativity with music.

EVERYBODY IS MESSING WITH MY MUSIC SO MUCH! Like everybody in my life has really told me I have a serious talent for this they've never seen before. 

So I have all this pressure to maintain that same unique creativity I get from smoking. And I myself only find inner peace and happiness through music and the feeling I get when I high af and listening to a song I created. Nothing will ever compare to that feeling. Idk what to do.

I'm living a new life now and I'm still overcoming addiction. Actually thats a lie, I'm not overcoming addiction anymore I'm overcoming the stunted emotional state and lack of personal maturity that a long term addiction brought about. 

An addicted life is an intense one. While I managed to do okay for myself despite addiction what suffered most was my personal growth and general approach to life. In the past ~~some of~~ my biggest enjoyment in life was related to getting stoned (and or drunk). Finally being able to hit a joint after a day of work, making it to the liquor store after work on a Friday and finally being able to do what I really wanted to be doing. Pure and utter bliss to my addicted self. Those were some intense feelings! The lows between the highs / drinks were particularily low and the highs from smoking and drinking were particularily high. These are not normal ranges the human would normally experience. Its very compelling and no wonder its such a hard cycle to break free from.

I quit drinking over 3 years ago and I won't go in too much detail about that recovery (but feel free to PM me about it if you want). I quit weed in  June 2020. The first 6 months were spent just getting through day by day. I learned as much as I could about recovery long before I started this journey. That all certainly helped especially during the first phase and then it took a lot of self discovering and learning to really get things on track. 

There was a reason I mentioned the intensity of addiction above. That is honestly a tough thing for normal life to compete with. Now, this isn't a bad thing but as an addict leaving his or her old life behind its likely going to feel like you're missing out on some important stuff. That stuff *was* important - it was important to your old life style and addicted way of living. That doesn't have a role in normal and sober life. Normal and sober life is much more controlled and even with a lot less drastic drops and spikes in mood / feelings. 

Having started using weed and booze early in life I never had the chance to develop myself mentally as an adult. That sounds a bit scary and it can be. It's also exciting as its a perfect opportunity to define yourself and work towards where you want to get in life. You can literally start practicing growing into the person you'd like to become. 

Now I had set goals as an addict. Most of them were shorter term and sadly a lot of them weren't achieved. Weed powered my creativity and stole my ambition to actually do anything with it, for the most part. An advantage of being sober is the clarity of mind and being able to stay on track. I'm setting longer term goals and reaching smaller more attainable goals along the way as I work towards the long term goals. This is very rewarding. Earlier in my recovery I had been a little depressed and I think it was the lack of direction I had in life. In a lot of ways my old addict mentality was still there and it just seemed like life lacked the kick it had before. It was because I wasn't using my new found freedom to get bigger things from life. As a sober person I can't just float day to day aimlessly, I need to be going somewhere. 

This really is just one aspect, there are so many other factors but all these things have added up to making life better and exciting to live again. It took a lot of work, a lot of thinking, introspection, growth and trial and error to get here but I'm so glad I did. Hopefully I've shared something of value somewhere in all of this.

Good luck all and have a great day!",62,0

I come here every time something happens and I’m embarrassed every time. I’m embarrassed that I can’t just stick with it. I’m embarrassed that I think I can handle it after I quitting for a while. I’m tired. I’m tired of the random CHS I’ve gotten 3 times in the past year now. I’m tired of feeling like shit all the time. I want to be the person who gets off work and goes to work out or do something productive. I don’t want to be the person who has to smoke every day. That’s where I end up every time. I could really use some words of encouragement. I am quitting again and I just know it’s going to be hard and also please send encouragement and advice for ways to stick with it.,3,0

anyway, got my shit together and kept on going the next day, however, its even harder now, the thought that haunts me the most is that i had an awesome time getting high again, and now the typical thought of how every single thing is more interesting to do while being high is on me, and sometimes im having fun sober and i think: ""oh my god this situation would be perfect with a joint"" and i get depressed instantly 

i think that this must be a natural part of the journey, so i would like to hear from you guys how you deal with this, specifically, this feeling that everything you do could be better if you were high.",5,0

My brain is just telling me all the time that It's okay to go buy few grams and this time I will keep it in control but I know it will go to daily use real fast.

Well. fast foreward to last tuesday and i was vomiting uncontrollabley and couldnt drink, i was choking down tiny amounts of water and almost all of it was comimg back up, and i STILL thought it was just some extreme combination of anxiety (which i have a history of) and stopping smoking. I kept quiet as my family dont know i smoke and i didnt want to admit to them the reason i was at this point, basically ruining our holiday, was due to my secret drug use. Long story short i ended up in hospital by thursday, diagnosed with hepititis and extreme dehydration which was damaging my liver, and on a drip unable to eat even now while i type this. I guess the reason im posting this is to say i was so obsessed with weed that i really didnt listen to my body and really got in a mess. I still dont know if the timing was just incredibly unfortumate or if weed really did cause/enhance this but it definately made me very health conscious - and ive decided to fully quit smoking as it definately clouded my judgement even in the period i first stopped, and i dont want to risk that anymore.

1143,2021-08-09 01:54:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/p0vev7/5_years_checking_in/,"5+ years, checking in.","Hello everyone. I've been a long time member of leaves, and I just want to post some thoughts about my experience because that part of me that wants to smoke has been getting louder lately, so I thought that getting it off my chest might help. 

Five years ago, I was depressed, had no career, romantic, or personal prospects. I took a leap of faith and a job in another country, which helped give me the motivation to quit and stay off weed. Since then, I've travelled over the world, I found a lifelong romantic partner, I've gone back to school, and I start working a new fulfilling job in the fall. I've never been more happy with myself and my future. By stopping smoking weed, I gave myself the room to develop into a functioning person, but it's taken a lot of help, and most people probably don't realize the difference they've made in my life. 

Despite this, that part of me that wants to smoke is still there. I don't think he's ever going away. In the cartoons, your bad thoughts are voiced by a devil on your shoulder. If that were the case, it would be easy to ignore. But in reality, the temptation arises from within yourself, not some evil caraciture. To this day I still have to contend with the part of me who wants to smoke. ""It's fine. You used to only smoke to escape your shitty life, but now that your life is good, this time it will be different. Just take a day off and relax. You know you want to. Nothing is stopping you. Just do it."" The voice says. Here's the hard part: everything the voice says is true. My motivation now is different, and I still want to. I never stopped wanting to smoke, I just know that it won't be good for me if I do. But that doesn't change the fact that I still want to. 

I know the world won't end if I smoke, but I'm worried that I might start returning to other bad habits if I start again, even just to try and ""see how it feels."" I don't want to be that depressed guy again with nothing going on. I know smoking is a step backwards. I know my life is good now. I know all of this, but that doesn't stop me from wanting it. 

I just wanted to share here with people who understand, and I needed to see my thoughts in writing. Only then can I remind myself of what's important. 

For everyone else who is struggling, stay with the struggle. Still wanting weed is not a failure. Every time you can say ""no"" is a success, no matter how many times you've said ""no"" before.

It’s like reality just hit me in the head like a brick and I’m finally sober enough to realize what I’ve been doing the past month and a half. 

Since I started smoking again, any time I felt any uncertainty or discomfort I immediately resort to smoking to avoid it. Now that I’m done smoking, not only can I not escape, but all the feelings I’ve been escaping from while smoking are now hitting me all at once. Kinda shitty. 

Just wanted to rant a bit and try and get my thoughts out. It’s kinda fucked how these subconscious patterns can just take a hold of our life if we’re not paying attention. I don’t think weed is necessarily

I started smoking weed when I was 14 years old. God damn that sounds terrible to write out now. I started because, looking back, I was insecure, and wanted to fit in with my peers and what I considered the “cool” kids. After a while though I truly started to love it. It was the perfect escape. I know all of you can relate. By the time I was 17, and a senior in high school I started smoking the kushery every single day. I remember during these times having thoughts like, “I will never quit smoking weed ever” and “Why wouldn’t you smoke weed it’s great for everything”. I was fully in love with weed. And I mean that.. in love.

Over the next 9 years I would end up smoking weed every single fucking day. Which is something I know many of you can relate on.

A lot happened to me in this time period. I was going to go into the military and didn’t cause I couldn’t quit smoking weed. Went to college for a year. Dropped out. Decided to move to Colorado and work for a ski resort. Met a girl out there. Moved to Portland, Oregon with her. Broke up. Moved back home to Atlanta. Rekindled my relationship with her. Moved to South Carolina. Broke up again. Moved back home again. Even though life changed for me year after year, one thing didn’t.. my relationship with the love of my life weed. I always had weed.

But something started changing even with my true love.. I started realizing I couldn’t let weed go. I was starting to get high and not enjoy it. Then I would be sober and want to be high. Repeat. Problems that were building in my life like being a flake to friends and family, and not committing to my goals were becoming more evident. I was starting to get paranoid and anxious when I was high. I wasn’t happy unless I was high, but when I was high I didn’t want to be anymore.

Wow. What the fuck happened. This plant that everyone said had no problems was starting to become a big fucking problem.

By the time I was 25 I had pretty much lost all my friendships. I no longer craved social interaction. I had goals but would rather fantasize about achieving them then working hard to achieve them. I knew it was the weed causing my issues. So I aimed at quitting.

In the course of a couples years I must of tried to quit what felt like a thousand times. Sometimes I wouldn’t make it through the night. Sometimes I would make it a week or two. One time I made it three months. All the while knowing that my problems would be solved if I just let this plant go. 

Finally after MANY failed attempts I quit smoking the sacred herb for a bit, and new this would be the one that lasted. I felt it in my soul.

This has been my longest quit to date, and there are some definite things I have learned along the way.

Weed was never the problem. It was me. I was using weed as an excuse to all the things that were wrong with me internally. Weed was just keeping me in a daze so I couldn’t see what was wrong. It was the band aid that I had used since my adolescence to cover up every insecurity, every bad emotion, every period of boredom, every self doubt, every anxiety, every depression. I didn’t know who I was without it. The problems that I thought weed was causing were still there. Sure I’m different without it, but a lot of the stuff I was blaming weed for was just really bad habits I had developed since my youth. Weed was my crutch and without letting go of my crutch I could never truly start to see who I really was and START the process of fixing these underlying issues about my character that I’ve been dealing with for years. I don’t blame weed anymore, I blame myself for letting myself get this bad. And I’m okay with that now. I take responsibility for my life now. It’s not weeds fault. It’s not my parents. It’s not my friends. It’s not my peers. It’s mine. My life is my responsibility. And the condition of my life is my responsibility.

7 months without the devil’s greenery now, and I feel everything. I have felt the lowest of lows, I have felt extreme highs. I have felt the years of negligence fall upon my shoulders, and I am ready to tackle what I have buried my self in. And I’m in no rush. Years of bad coping mechanisms is going to take some time to get out of. I am a work in progress and for the first time I am okay with this. I will always be a work in progress and I am okay with this. And so should you.

This community has helped me through a lot and I want to give my thanks, but I’m off of it for now. I will not smoke weed again, for a very long time. I can’t promise I won’t ever again, but right now I have uncovered that I have a lot to work on. And right now my life long love partner and I have to be separated for me to grow. I think toward the end there maybe it was just trying to let me know that all along.

Smoked once, it was nice. Didn't think about weed that much. Smoked the next weekend. Then thought hey, why not light up on a Friday night because my work is done.

I wouldn't accept the possibility of never smoking weed again before, but at this point, I welcome it. I am sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I'm done with letting a plant that I don't even enjoy have any kind of hold or power over me. I'm done romanticizing the past experiences from my high school days, back when smoking weed was innocent and carefree. It is never going to have that effect anymore, because I am not that person anymore. It's time to be free. It's time to be a person I can be proud of. 

&#x200B;

I've cut back significantly this past week. It's been a couple tokes a night, not getting me high but enough to help me eat without vomiting. The middle 3 nights of this week, I got 3 hours of sleep over a 72 hour period, so that's not fun but it's starting to get easier. I got back into the gym and started eating healthy again.. My physical energy levels are beginning to return. And I haven't even fully quit yet, all I've done is significantly cut back. Anxiety has been high and brain running on overdrive, but that's just the withdrawal. This post has been long and thank you for reading if you made it this far down. I don't really know how to end this post so here's a quote from an all time great that helps me through hard times.

I'm on day 12, after ten years of heavy daily weed use, among a fair bit of drinking and other things. I've stopped everything after I've run into a few health issues, mostly caused I suspect by my lifestyle.

It's been alot of ups and downs over the past 12 days, days of feeling okay, days of intense anxiety and lethargy. Sleep is still a bit of an issue.

Two days ago I was sitting there feeling really anxious, wondering what to do with myself...I picked myself up and drove out to a forest and went for a long walk. I started to notice the birds, the smells, the sound of gravel under my foot and I felt a wave of calm wash over me, akin to that first hit after a long day. I thought to myself ""as bad as things can feel, the exact opposite can happen too, life can be really hard sometimes, but as hard as it gets, it can also be really beautiful at times."" 

I imagine alot of people here relate to using weed to numb whatever it may be that ails you. however, allowing yourself to feel the bad also allows you to feel the good. I spent most of my 20s numb, never really upset, but never truly happy either. So now everytime I feel depressed or anxious I'm just going to think to myself, the feelings of joy are going to be that much better. 

In part I just wanted to write this down so I remember it myself, but hey, maybe it will help someone else to.",64,0

I can’t call what I’m feeling happy anymore. When I’m high and watching something, to be honest it still makes me pretty happy. But that’s just one tv show and one pint of ice cream. It isn’t being in the moment with my friends. Actual conversations that don’t have the buffer of my complete dissociation from reality. I love being high, no matter how progressively shitty being sober is, the act of being high is amazing. I can’t pretend like I suddenly hate it and everything about it. 

I totally get why I used it. I was already dispassionate towards life when I started 5 years ago. I used to think people were making the wrong choice by being sober. That reality was too depressing to face raw. Sober or not, humans did fuck up the planet and sober or not, we have no idea what the future for humans has in store other than things will definitely get worse. I am an optimistic nihilist that has been relying on the world ending any day now as an excuse to smoke every night. 

But dammit society just won’t collapse just yet, and I don’t think weed is a sustainable way to wait until that point anymore. Behind all this meaninglessness and nothingness I know there is something special I can’t see. Getting high, eating ice cream, and watching anime will always sound amazing. But waking up with the same feeling of fuck I can’t do this anymore and forgetting it by night time is starting to take a toll. I’m becoming worse and worse at pretending to be a normal functioning human that cares about the world around him. 

The apathy and lethargy are overwhelming and all I feel the desire or motivation to do these days is sleep until nighttime when my family is asleep so I can smoke. It’s only like the first 30 minutes or so that are actually enjoyable, the rest of the high I spend trying to find whatever was making the first part of the high so nice. The more numb I get, the more frequent the voice in my head begging to be even more fucked up gets. Need to quit but I’m terribly afraid of feeling things again, especially the depression and uncertainty that comes along with withdrawals being the first things I feel.

The substance was always on my mind, when I wasn't smoking, I was thinking about when the next time I was going to partake would be. It distracted me from everything, and deep down, I always knew it was wrong. Now, I am weed free for four weeks. 

**Days 1-7**: The first day was deceiving. Felt a new sense of clarity and motivation due to quitting weed, and then it went downhill. Days two through about seven consisted of no sleep, no appetite, no motivation to do even the simplest tasks, and complete agitation with everyone and everything in my life.

**Days 8-14**: Slowly but surely, everything started to come back. My appetite was back, and my god does food taste better sober (also went back to eating more, which is good for me, because when I didn’t smoke till night I wouldn’t eat all day). Sleep has always been a slight issue, but I developed a new sleep routine and started having sort of vivid dreams. Motivation and happiness came back, but not for long. 

**Days 15-21**: Probably the hardest part of quitting this substance. I had to accept that I could not moderate weed, which was hard at first, but once I realized that it was doing more harm than good, I found a lot of clarity and motivation starting to trickle back into my life. My cousin was in town during this stretch of time, and he was smoking THE ENTIRE TIME, he even smoked in front of me, AND I DID NOT GIVE IN ONCE. This time period opened me up mentally, and showed me that I WAS STRONG. It showed me I had willpower and that I was being brutally real and honest with myself and my long term goals.

**Days 16-28**: Since the third week, I have not felt any sort of withdrawal. Appetite is golden, I have very vivid and memorable dreams, and I'm so much more active in social situations. I've had some slight anxiety and a couple thoughts rationalizing weed use, but I told those thoughts to shut the fuck up, as it was just my addiction talking to me. 

I've tried to quit three times before this, and always failed around the two week mark. This time it is not the same. The factor that differentiates this time from all the others is that I'm making ACTIVE LIFESTYLE CHANGES. **You will not be able to kick this habit if you do not change your lifestyle.** Instead of doing the same thing I did when I was smoking, I started doing rigorous exercise, I started reading, I started valuing time with loved ones, I started learning to be more empathetic (with myself and others). This is just the start of my journey to clarity and sobriety. I will not go back to something that does more harm than good. I used weed to numb, not to have fun. I can't moderate weed use, nor will I ever try to again.

I'm going to college in 11 days, and I am not going to smoke weed. I know that if I do, I'll go right back into the cycle of addiction, which is something that hinders me throughout ALL ASPECTS OF MY LIFE.

**Willpower is a muscle**. Like any muscle, with more practice, it gets stronger. Saying no to weed only strengthens you. Do not be scared to be around weed. Get uncomfortable, because in the long run, it only makes you more comfortable. I'm going to be faced with tons of weed use in college, and I firmly believe I'll say no every time, because I've already proven to myself that I CAN. 

**Accept the fact that you can not moderate weed use.** If you are browsing this sub, and can relate to most of the posts, I believe that you are an addict and can't moderate your usage of weed. Quit. Now. It's worth it.

**Please do not hesitate to reach out or ask any questions**. Whether it be advice, encouragement, or conversation, I'm willing to offer my (somewhat) knowledge TO ANYONE on this sub. I love you all. We are stronger than this addiction, having the strength to kick it is something that will show you that you CAN DO ANYTHING IN LIFE.",9,0

I did not expect it to happen...
But after 10 months of sober and being absoluetely happy about it, I relapsed for 4 days.

Funnily it was the same day someone else wrote that they are on holiday and felt tempted and I wrote to stay strong together since I was on holiday with family myself.

It was a nature holiday with camping, the mountains and lakes. 

Somehow I was curious suddenly and thought I am away from my normal life and would try.

It was pure with a bong. It was very very weird.
The cloud came around me. It did feel so distant as if I could not remember how it was, but I smoked for 20+ years before.

I did not like it, it was just numb. That is how I was all the time? I got a headache too.

The next day I took a hit from a joint which was more pleasurable but no so different. The next two days I rolled two pure doobies each day for me and my girlfriend who also stopped 10 months ago.

Was it great? No not really. It was numb and slow and kind of pleasureable and warm. But also paranoid and small minded. Most annoying was the urge to smoke even though I did not like it that much. Seeing the others smoke or going to smoke ir suspecting them soon to smoke. 

Why did I continue? Because thats what my addict brain does. 

After these 4 days I stopped again since I am in my normal daily life again. 

Wow. That was what I was doing all the time?
And wow. That is how easily the grip of addiction comes back? 

I do not beat myself too much up for it.
Just being more annoyed that I smoked for sooo many years!

Well. Back on sober horse and it feels much better.",4,0

It’s going to suck at first, you’ll tell yourself “what’s the point, I won’t enjoy it” but then you’ll realize you’ll lose yourself in the activity and might just enjoy it. Yesterday I dragged my ass to a rock climbing gym, convinced I wasn’t going to have fun. Guess what? I had a blast and thanked myself for being brave enough to go.

TLDR not worth.","How did the relapse happen? A simple case of willpower being finite and finally running out. I am in an unfortunate living situation for someone trying to embrace sobriety. My social circle is full of people who never stop partying, temptation is everywhere. The house I live in gets wild on occasion. There was a house party and booze as well as other things were involved. I partook and finally at the end of the night, when everyone was winding down and smoking weed and “relaxing”, a combination of FOMO and disinhibition got the best of me.

I told myself fuck it, one night revisiting it couldn’t hurt. The weed was way too strong as I had no tolerance after 7.5 months clean. That night it wasn’t even enjoyable. But you know what happens next right? I woke up the next day and said to myself “hey, you already smoked, might as well make a weekend out of it and then get back on track.” So I made a weekend out of it, which then turned into a 3 week bender because you know, addiction.

Near the end of the third week smoking I was not having fun. I felt like shit; lethargic, lazy, bloated and full of fast food because I’ll be damned if I’m exercising or cooking healthy food while weed is in my system. It’s really like weed completely turns me into a different person, the exact person I don’t want to be. The whole time I was indulging my addiction all I felt outside of a shallow fleeting euphoria was self-loathing. And then I finally woke up and asked myself just what the fuck I was doing.

See the past 7.5 months were not spent just white-knuckling through cravings, no. It was a journey of self-discovery and self-mastery. I meditated regularly, changed my lifestyle and diet, lost 65 pounds, started reading again, practiced emotional control, and came to terms with past regrets and the cost of addiction. That progress doesn’t just disappear. So I woke up at the end of my 3 week bender to face my self-destruction and I asked myself if I was happier doing this or being sober? And in that moment the total absurdity of what I was doing to myself really hit me. The progress I made doesn’t instantly disappear, but if I kept going, it would eventually be erased.

So I dropped it once again and I’m a week sober and back to feeling great, feeling like the real me. Withdrawal was not nearly as bad as last time, just 2-3 nights of poor sleep. I am so fucking happy that I didn’t let the binge go longer. I spent 30/33 of the past weeks sober and I’m proud of it, sobriety continues to be the best decision I’ve ever made. If you’re craving right now, I will be the first to tell you IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. Keep building a life that you don’t ever want to escape from and the choice of staying sober becomes simple.",477,0

Yes, it can get overwhelming. You may think you are losing your mind. You might feel disocciated from reality. The feeling is real and it is terrifying. You might think you’ll never get out of it. You may start fearing going to bed in fear of another sleepless night. You might have an inexplicable feeling of dread and doom that you can’t just shake off, no matter what. 

But then, slowly, day after day, you will start noticing tiny improvements. Every day gets a little bit better. You need to put in the work, though: look after yourself; exercise; eat properly; be mindful; remind yourself that you’re stronger than this and that it is a temporary feeling; remind yourself what matters and what you’re grateful for every day; get help from therapist or doctors if you feel you might need a help, trust them and follow their lead.

Please allow me to vent by sharing my story.

I was, prior to a month ago, a consumer of on average 1g of cannabis a day for 15 solid years. I was a shy kid, struggled socially, and I met the guy. let us call him Andy, who became my best friend in sixth form college (think US grades 11-12). Up to that point, I had been denied a traditional family upbringing in favour of residential boarding schools since the age of 7. My mother died in childbirth and my father went AWOL. I was raised initially by my grandmother. This guy introduced me into his family *-* my first experience of a nuclear family - and they pretty much adopted me at age 17. I even went on holidays with them, and at age 21, when I built my first business, I brought on Andy's father as a key supplier (unfortunately he ran into a problem of his own making and had to be replaced by a third party at significant expense to me, but Andy and I swore to never let that interfere with our friendship).

Andy and his older brothers also introduced me to cannabis. I had never done drugs before.  Initially it was once every now and then, but once I went away to university, the use increased to every weekend, and after university, and certainly after his father bombed out as a supplier to my business venture, it became daily. We felt our common blazing helped manage the same strains on friendship that would broken a thousand other friendships of people who went into business together and then had it fail. Once I was able to complete the venture and sell it profitably (although not the spectacular success it could have been), we figured it was water under the bridge anyway.

And so it continued; weed, videogames, a string of failed relationships with girls because I preferred to spend my time doing the first two with Andy, and during the downtime I would work like a dog on one business venture or another to finance it all. Before I began this latest quit attempt, I calculated how much I had spent. The figures will horrify you.  Cannabis? Roughly $50k since 2007. The takeaways as a result of being too high to leave the sofa? In excess of another $50k.  A good chunk of those takeaways also fed Andy, who hasn't had any real form of gainful employment his entire adult life. But he was my best friend, the person I cared about the most. I loved him. 

I am not looking to brag, rather I am utterly ashamed. $100k is a life changing sum of money for 99.9% of people. I could have fed starving kids, saved a species of animal, or helped the homeless. At $4 a dose it could have funded 125,000 people to get fully vaccinated against Covid. Instead, it went to a long list of drug dealers and the CEOs and stockholders of international fast food outlets. They say cannabis makes your money go up in smoke. No truer words spoken.

My relationship with Andy also started its decline during lockdown. Whilst before we hung out closely out of choice for a good 13 years, now we were forced to by law as we were housesharing temporarily at the time. Our country was in and out of lockdowns and other restrictions, as fear blazed on our television screens. We would end up arguing over silly little things and this was only made worse when Andy's father suddenly passed away. The consumption of cannabis and takeaways, as you can imagine, continued unrelenting throughout. By July 2021, Cannabis had gone from the material which formed our bond to the only thing keeping us on speaking terms. 

Until I smoked one bong too many, of one high-THC strain too many, and I had a psychotic breakdown. In the midst of a waking nightmare of visual and tactile hallucinations, thinking there was a large insect in my ear, I begged Andy to help take me to the hospital. He refused, and went back to his bong and videogames in that moment. I was forced to fight waves of nausea as I made my way to the hospital. That would be the first of two ER visits I would make during what became week 1. It turned out I had a severe ear infection - but what devastated me most of all, was that my supposed best friend had left me hanging on the vine when I had needed him the most. This resulted in a very heated argument and I packed my stuff quickly, got in my car, and went to my dad's house (we have formed a relationship for around 10 years now). I was there for a week whilst I sorted more permanent accommodation arrangements.

During the course of July, I continued to try to hang out with Andy and his friends in the house we once shared, which has for much of the last 3 years been essentially a cannabis and videogame den and continues to be so to this very day. Squalid and unkempt. The stains of countless bong and soft drink spills covered by fast food containers from the 150+ takeaway establishments sampled through our equivalent of Doordash or Grubhub. Large, albeit a few years outdated, flatscreens on the walls connected to communally shared Netflix, Amazon, Disney+ and Xboxes. All the while, hoping our relationship could be rebuilt even when I was sober, or that I could convince him to join me on my road to sobriety. I endured bong smoke twirling around my face; Andy and his friends are still heavy bong smokers. Yes, I still cared about him that much.

Last night, on my month ""anniversary"", I received my second vaccine dose and with it, the assurance that I would be able to do things I wanted to do in a sober life going forward - travel, clubs, festivals. I had been looking forward to this moment for months and months. As you can probably imagine, I was given serious abuse by Andy and co for even taking it - weed induced paranoia had of course infused their politics too. The conversation did not go well.

 No, he would not be quitting.

 No, he would not alter his lazy attitude and make life changes to improve his situation. 

No, we were no longer aligned on anything anymore.

And he resented the business success I had achieved.

I disconnected my Xbox, that had remained in the house the whole time. I didn't even bother to unplug the wires as they were grouped up in cable ties. I was, after 15 years, finally done and I told him that straight to his face. He seemed unperplexed, and I took that as confirmation of all I needed to know about the state of affairs. I told him I would not be seeing him again.

As I write this, I sit in a rented room in a HMO (house of multiple occupation) housed with 6 other strangers, most are students wondering why I am even here. A rented room was the quickest and easiest accommodation solution that I could sort from my dad's house. It's clean enough, and pretty cheap, but the ceiling and walls have no sound insulation. It's a temporary solution, on my road to recovery. As I lie here at night, listening to the clamour of the bar a few doors down, I reflect that the relationship with Andy was a truly abusive one, and that my addiction to cannabis meant I stayed in it for years longer than I should have. Andy was my supplier, too. Without him, I would have had no access.

I am glad for the people on this subreddit. You have been my strength. I can't talk to my family about this, and even my Dad had little patience for his 32 year old son suddenly landing on his doorstep, hence the need to present a solution to him quickly. As all of Andy's friends were my friends, so goes my friendships with them too. Around 10 people in total down to 0. 

I am now the most alone I have been since I was 17 years old.

I will rebuild, though. Like my sobriety, I'm just taking it day by day. Find a better accommodation, find new hobbies as our country finally opens up after lockdowns, and hopefully new friends.

I'm 25 and have been smoking since I was 14. When I was younger it was cool, all my friends were doing it. As we all grew up, most of them stopped smoking by the time college came to an end others stopped right after high school. I never stopped though. Honestly it got worse and worse to where it's at the point now where if I get home from work and I don't light one up. I'm pissed off, bitter, rude to my family, don't want to talk and just plain miserable that I'm not high. For a long time I didn't think of it as a problem because I told myself ""I can quit anytime I just like being high"". But now nearly 11 years after smoking nearly every day. I'm starting to see the impact it's had on my family. Specifically my son, when I'm sober I'm just angry and everything he does just irritates me. I smoke and I start playing with him and enjoying his company (he's 3). I just want to enjoy my time with him even when I'm sober. I don't want him to grow up thinking his dad's just an angry shithead until he smokes. 

I don't drink, I used to be heavy into it when I was 17-21 then my son was born and I was able to just stop. Now alcohol just doesn't taste good to me anymore. But weed is that one consistent thing I've always had that's made me feel fine. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I just want to enjoy the sober times and not feel like i just need to smoke to function.",2,0

I classify myself to be quite a rational individual so feeling that centre and grounding without the weed was incredible. I’m not missing it, I’m not craving it, I know I’m doing the right thing and I’m so excited to get back in touch with myself.

Weed didn't make me feel ecstatic or make me forget my problems and it definitely didn't fix them for me. It may have put a comforting veil on for a moment, but deep down I knew it wasn't real.

What actually gave me a sense of fulfillment was to face my challenges and grow. 4 days ago I ran my first 10K, 10,7km in one hour and 6 seconds (6,6miles for my Americanos). I actually have been feeling more confident after that, because that has been my goal for 2 years to run a 10k and I finally did it. 

Broken feet, feeling tired af afterwards, but I beat my past self and reached my goal. (the previous longest run I had done a few weeks ago was 6,4km, so this was a significant increase in distance and endurance). Everytime I overcome my past limits or do something despite my fears, that's when I really feel the best.",80,0

I have experienced depression since about the age of 11, it’s been a constant drag on every part of my life. I’ve been medicated for approximately 10 years but it only just takes the edge off and doesn’t help if the feeling happens to hit really hard. When I started smoking weed, my anxiety disappeared, I remembered what it was like to enjoy things and feel happy so as you can probably guess, I’m not too enthusiastic about quitting. 

I have to quit as weed is actually destroying my boyfriends mental health and he won’t be able to unless it’s not around him at all. I care about his health and happiness more than weed so we are definitely quitting. I’m just struggling with the suicidal feelings that are going to shortly ensue. I don’t want to go back to life being grey and cold. Im trying to understand why someone with mental health problems would want to quit? Is there a benefit to this that I’m missing that could provide some comfort? Im just struggling to see the point of life if you never experience happiness.",3,0

I know that I'm not living my best quality of life as a stoner. I've tried quitting and the longest I stayed sober was only 3 weeks!

I know that if I smoke in the morning it will ruin my day and make me a lot less productive. I hate smoking, I really do, I hate the taste, the smell, my internal dialog turns up a few notches and I'm constantly at war with myself- a lot of negative self talk. I truly, deeply know that I'm not suppose to be smoking but yet I continue to smoke. 


Addiction is war with yourself. I've started smoking  6 years ago to help lessen my depression and have found it helpful with lifting a depressive episode. However, I have now started smoking from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. I stopped driving because I do not drive while high, ever which has caused me a lot of sadness because I am a social person and weed has robbed me of that. I have been using it as a crutch for so many things. Change is hard and I need to find a way to start caring more about my health and wellbeing. I keep smoking and I feel out of control.",5,0

I feel pretty great, with the exception of sleep. Last week I kept waking up at 5:00 am, and being unable to get back to sleep. Last week I also decided to quit drinking, so my guess is that it's part of alcohol withdrawal? Never considered myself a heavy drinker, but maybe it was also a bad habit that I tended to underestimate. 

Anyway, what really worked for me so far is just to change how I fill my free time. With weed it was nothing but gaming, watching YouTube and binge eating. Now I fill my days (beside work) with boxing, running, reading and meditation. I try to limit my screen time as much as possible, since I know that can be deceiving time-sink that just makes me feel bad.

It first started hitting me around 9 years ago, I would have intense naseau and vomiting up to 20 times a day with no resolve - other than spending hours upon hours in a hot bath. Without this, the pain would grow and be very dibilating.

It sent me to the ER. I was feeling as if my heart was going to explode and my insides were twisting. All tests came back negative, so they would replenish my fluids and tell me it is just stress.

This would go on to happen around once or twice a year, brought on by times of intense stress and periods without eating. In between these episodes, I would wake up with an upset stomach regularly and would randomly get nauseous when I try to eat. Everytime I would go see doctors or go to the hospital, I was told it was stress..

Fast forward to last Wendesday, after about a week of intense vomiting, pain, and limited food/water, I was back in emerg. I was talking to the nurse whose mother has CHS and explained what it was like for her. Every symptom, every sentence -  everything ahout it was exactly what I was going through. The only cure? Quit cannabis.

My family doctor had originally mentioned CHS as a possible reason a few years ago and asked if I would quit. I always downplayed how much I smoked though and I was in denial, I couldn't believe that weed could do this. Not when it is supposed to do the opposite. 

I haven't smoked anything in three days and plan to not smoke again. I wanted to post to bring some light to this conditon, as it is still new and many things unknown. Weed can be beneficial to many people, but for me it was the thing ruining my appetite and bringing me pain

First of all the fact you are on here is a great sign, so don't be let down.

I'm one of those people you hear about that had a psychosis (not solely caused by cannabis, but it was a big factor). You always think about people like me as numbers, but trust me, it's way more common than you think, and even if theres a 0.000001% chance of having a psychosis, it's not worth the risk, trust me you don't want to live what I've been through.

I started smoking at a young age, and became addicted pretty fast, slowly and surely my view on life declined as time went by. Your personality also changes, you're not that quirky funny person you used to be, cannabis just makes you think there's problems when there isn't any, and if you're not like that then it makes you too content with your shitty life consisting of ordering food, smoking blunts, and playing video games on the sofa.

Anyway, I got diagnosed in 2015 with psychosis, and kept smoking despite all the doctors and nurses warning me about it, because deep down I still hadn't realised how bad it truly is.

It was only 2 years ago, actually on the day of 420, I hadn't smoked that day because I smoked the day prior and didn't like to smoke two days in a row, and we all went home after spending the day in the park. I start messaging my friend, and I ask him how he feels, and he tells me that he was feeling so tired he cancelled his other plans and went home to rest in bed. Whereas me, I felt amazing from spending the day in the park and still had tons of energy. Thats when I realise thats how weed made me feel for years, just tired and lazy. That nasty shit just saps all your energy, creativity and motivation.

If you're on here, it means your body, or your subconscious mind, is telling you to stop, so do yourself a favor for once and listen to these demands.

If you want to learn more about the detrimental effects of cannabis on a developing brain I suggest you do some research. If you started smoking young like me, things will make more sense and you'll realise most stoners are just losers, career wise or just in general.

However, I want to add some positivity before I leave, after you quit, around a couple of months to a year, your mentality will change in a good way, you'll be more grounded into reality, less delusions, and more focused on the important things in life.",7,0

I feel so motivated when I write out some goals and start taking strides to achieve them. Yet, I see myself in my head constantly celebrating “at the finish line” with smoking a fat joint. I then begin to rationalize; “I’ll quit when I get my degree” “I’ll stop before my 28th birthday next month” and the most depressing one: “I’ll keep working here until I save up enough money and obtain my degree before looking elsewhere.” Truly, with that last one, I realized that I say that to myself because I’m scared to see just how incompetent I truly might be. The job that I do now is easy, it’s routine and I can think about other things while doing it… however, it’s only $15.00 an hour and not the kind of gig that will make me a millionaire in 5-10 years. 
I started smoking when I was 22. I can’t seem to go a day without it now. When I get close to the end of my stash, I start to feel motivated (initially), and excited, thinking about all the ways I’ll evolve after getting this substance out of my life. Just as fast as I become motivated, I become what seems hyper aware of my situation, past situations, decisions made that lead to certain consequences… and then I’m back to wanting to smoke. The longest I had gone without smoking in the last 5-6 years, is two months. That was back when I had just started smoking so it was easier to stop. Over the years it’s gotten harder to quit. My biggest fear at this point is capitulation. Convincing myself “well I’ve been smoking this long. Why stop now?” and 20 years have gone by. It’s not that far fetched… I’ve already given this habit 6 years of my life. The most consistent thing I’ve done in my life is smoke and find ways to do it. Never thought this would be me. I’m 22 hours sober and trying to reach that 24 hour mark. Decided to post instead of indulging the thoughts of smoking.",681,0

My long term relationship ended messily in  March of 2020 and then Covid hit. In March-July of 2020 I was an  essential worker but any day I wasn't working was a free for all of  vodka, joints and binge eating. I was getting blackout alone in my room  every weekend and gorging myself because the munchies meant I never felt  full. I gained around 10kg. I wasn't in a good place at all. In June I  realized I needed to get help so I went back to therapy and started  working through all the shit I never had because I was too busy getting  high. Weed was escapism for me, an escape from reality, my brain and my  feelings. I was ready to quit when my mum mentioned my dad wanted to  have a family meeting about my smoking and I got so freaked out I threw  away everything. I remember feeling pretty shitty at the very start but a  very serious panic attack after smoking a bong after a few weeks of  sobriety scared me straight. I kept going to therapy, exercising  regularly, eating better, drinking less and spent weekends with my new  partner which is the healthiest relationship I've ever been in. It's 10  months in now and I can solidly say I'm doing significantly better now  than I was a year ago.  


However, lately the cravings have been  getting stronger. It started on Dry July with a friend suggesting we  have edibles and talked about their experience smoking weed. I've said  no to edibles but a part of me wants to make an edible cake for my one  year anniversary, though I know that defeats the purpose. I'm still on  stoner tik tok too which never helps, the algorithm still believes I'm a  smoker and it brings temptation. I'm drinking much less now because I  take prescription medication and I feel like absolute shit the next day  which means I don't have a substance to use as escapism anymore. Weed  doesn't do anything for me but give me a break from reality and my mind.  It makes me dumb and unable to do anything but eat and watch content  which is something I'm trying to do less now. I'm in such a better place  but the cravings have been so strong, especially this weekend. The  place I live is back in lockdown, just like I was in March-July of 2020,  so I'm unable to see my partner or any friends to distract me. I've  been talking to myself about it all day how it's not a good decision for  my long term health and how weed doesn't serve me but still the  cravings are so loud. I've been searching for the littlest trace of weed  but the house is completely clean. All my brain wants to do is smoke. I  have ways to get it but I refuse to send the message. I can't smoke  tonight but god my brain wants too so bad. Does anyone have any  suggestions on what I could do to get my brain to shut off?

My longest break off weed was when i was 31 and i quit for around 5 years. I got married, bought a house, had a great job- life was going in a good direction. But i wasnt happy in my marriage. 

Then i bumped into some old friends who were smoking weed. They looked up to me because i was doing well, and i started chilling with them and smoking thinking nothing of it. 

Cut a long story short- all i wanted to do was smoke. I lost my job, got divorced, lost my house, had a baby girl with someone, lost them too, became broke, lost my friends, moved back in with parents. 

I threw away everything. Everything collapsed after i hit the weed again. Crying every night to myself, shut myself away from society. Im sorry to say I entirely blame the weed. I should have never started again. 

And so here we are, day one completed without smoking weed but i cant sleep. Mad sweats at the moment. Im also worried about the dreams and nightmares coming back because the weed would suppress all of that for years.

I’m a musician (I have a regular day job, music is a side thing) and have been working on some projects and doing great. I’ve been a regular smoker for maybe 6-7 years. Well, I quit about 3 weeks ago because it was causing some issues in my life and my assumption was that my music would be even better because I’d be more motivated and clear headed. Seems like the opposite has happened. Ive almost completely lost interest in music, and I’m completely unmotivated. Ive mostly made it through withdrawal, feel a lot better, I can sleep now, etc, but that motivation has not come back. I used to come home from work, smoke a little, then joyfully work on music for hours and make some great stuff. Now, I get home and basically just watch tv or look at my phone and don’t really want to do anything else. I know plenty of people who don’t smoke at all who are unproductive and lead similar lives, so I understand that I’m not going to be motivated simply because I’m not smoking. Tbh, I’m on the verge of just going back because I felt like I was making great progress with music and art and I don’t want to lose that and just be a couch potato. I can force myself, but it’s not the same. There’s no magic anymore. Before I ever smoked, I was always a lazy kid and struggled to do homework or chores and basically just played video games so it’s not like this is much different than before I started smoking.

  I recently stopped denying that weed was helping me, I mean it did for some time but I abused it and it turned my crutch into a sword.  I quit a few times in the second stint of 12 years but it was always a temporary thing, like I had to land a job or was on vacation and couldn't bring it, but I always knew it was temporary and it was only ever for like 2 weeks max.  Now I'm stopping for good, my marriage to Mary Jane is over and I'm just waiting to feel normal. 

 I know smoking it for as long as I did will take some time to feel normal but it can't come fast enough.  I was hoping by 3 weeks I would feel better, still have anhedonia and brain fog.  I'm not as lazy now, still have very little motivation or interests in hobbies and such that made me happy but if I walk by my sink and there's dishes or the trash is full I don't just ignore it for days on end but everything is just fucking flat.  I just want to be able to connect with people again and laugh and actually mean it not just because my mind is blank and I have nothing to add to the conversation.

  I hope to make a thread here one day that is a bit more positive than this, sorry if this anything is worded weird or whatever, I feel like I have a single digit IQ right now.",8,0

I really don't have any words of wisdom or a magic secret that made it stick this time around. I've tried quitting so many times but I never made it past 30 days - this time is finally different. The most important piece of advice I can give someone starting their journey is; **tell someone**.

For me, having my parents and friends aware of my addiction was pivotal to making a serious change in my life. I've been living my life on autopilot for nearly 4 years, and I'm finally starting to get a grip on the steering wheel again.

But there's this really weird thing for me. And that's that I don't have a sex drive if I'm not high.

Like literally no sex drive and no attraction to people sexually or romantically. An attractive woman could come up to me and ask me out and I'd be like, ""eh, nah I'm just gonna chill at home."" 

But, I know that if I smoked some weed, I would become incredibly horny, and then I would just enjoy some porn and masturbation and that stuff. I don't feel the urge to do that now that I don't smoke weed.

Just sex drive = gone.

I put my box away in April last year, after scraping out every last shred and refusing to buy more. 

I literally can’t believe I used to smoke so much. I was constantly high. I would smoke on the way to work, preroll for the moment I got out of work, and then hourly until I went to sleep. Sometimes I’d wake up in the night and smoke some more. 

Over the last year I’ve attempted to toke a couple of times and ended up with three day long headaches. My heart beats so fast I think it’s definitely coming out my chest this time. My ears ring and I can’t even contemplate sleep. 

If you’re just starting quitting, keep going. 

I found not counting the days actually helped. Each hour and each day at a time. Don’t worry if it’s been a day, a week, a month, be happy you didn’t smoke *today*. 

My productivity has soared. Although at first I struggled a little bit with replacing weed with alcohol, I put that down too and seriously I am such a better person for it. 

Be proud of the small achievements. Make your bed in the morning and take a second when you get home to appreciate that sight. 

Pick up something you’ve wanted to try for a while, for me it was basic cooking. I got back into reading because I wasn’t so high that I couldn’t follow the words. 

Each day I am sad that I lost so much time to smoking but overall far happier that I managed to stop when I did. 

It doesn’t matter if you fell off the path. Keep going. You can do it. Here to talk if anybody needs it. 

Peace out guys. You can still be a stoner at heart without making the fucker palpitate into oblivion!",37,0

And it's really hard that my dads business partner, a guy I really like and respect, makes good points about the benefits weed can have. Like! I know it can be a medicine when used correctly, but I dont think me getting out of my head is using it correctly! (Me, yelling at myself)

- Regular Cannabis smoker (once a month since 2014, once a week since 2018, every day since 2020)
- Don’t exercise much
- Used to eat anything and everything and at any times 

It has now been :
- 12 weeks since i quit junk food , high sodium food, midnight snacks 
- 9 weeks since I have been exercising daily 
- 6 weeks since I last smoked a cigarette 
- 3 weeks since I smoked Cannabis 

Went cold turkey on both occasions when I quit tobacco and cannabis but didn’t quit all bad habits at once . Paced it one at a time every 3 weeks . 

What has changed and why i did this:

- my blood pressure was regularly 160+/120+
- pulse was regularly 100+
- would not get any work done and by always lazy 
- Weighed 220 pounds 
- could only sleep 3-4 hours at a time 

Had to go to a doctor and a cardio to get on meds . So decided to leave one bad habit at a time and paced it for every 3 weeks 

End result 
- Blood pressure now on 120/80 with meds 
- feel 3x more efficient and energetic 
- lost 15 pounds in last 12 weeks 
- started remembering my dreams again
- able to sleep for 8 hours straight 

Pulse is still high and can feel palpitations often after workout and during nights . Getting an EKG done for that but otherwise everything else seems normal and great .

But There is this urge to reward yourself with just 1 joint. It is not a craving but a feeling that I deserve one for all the hard work I have put in over the last 12 weeks .

Anyone else feel that ? How can I avoid that? Or is it okay to reward yourself once a month ?  Similar to twice a month cheat days I have for food .

Till now I always had one bad habit to leave every 3 weeks and it kept me engaged and motivated. Now when all 4 are done I just feel like rewarding myself . 

Don’t want to end up being a daily smoker again … and that’s the only fear stopping me from smoking up again . But I don’t know for how long I can keep that at bay. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",1,0

Slightly paranoid about jinxing myself, but then again, I did NOT expect to have such a hard time. I'm stepping back from delta 8 this time around; in the last few years I've messed around another substance, and while that had all the negative effects of sapping productivity, etc., I didn't find the stepping back from it all that challenging when I decided enough was enough (on multiple occasions because apparently I love being caught up in this cycle).

This delta 8 is tricky though. More insidious than regular weed too, because I found that I could take it any time and no one could tell. I've been irritable, had REALLY strong cravings that are still with me, some trouble sleeping. All of these things could be related to other stuff in my life (work stress, family drama, etc.) so who knows.

Wanting to take a step back and see what this relapse has cost me. I was visiting my father who is aging and developing some health issues, my sister is... feeling the need to be in charge of everything, and as my family of origin is somewhat toxic, this was of course the perfect excuse to find a substance to use (my inner addict thrives on unhappiness for this very reason, I suspect). Delta 8 came along as an option and I LOVED it.

That was 2 months ago. In the time since, I have...

* Not been consistently preparing healthy food
* Not been particularly effective at work (lots of angst and foggy-headedness)
* Not been writing
* Exercising? Mmmmmmm......

Those are my metrics. In the last 12 days, I have...

* Still not picked up with healthy food PREP, although less mindless / lazy eating
* Pretty much killed it at work this last week
* Back on track with writing (recently got my first short story accepted for publication at professional rates, which means so much to me)
* Exercising? Well......... sooooon, I'm sure.

Anyhow, I've just been reflecting that if picking it back up again means I'm off track for another 2 months (or longer, because this was so much harder than I thought) - I just can't keep doing it. I'm in my 40s, so for something like the writing -- I don't know, I feel like I'm already making up for lost time from my history of drinking and addiction with other things.

Anyhow, thanks for letting me ramble on and share my thoughts. Glad to be here. Also getting back to this... I don't know, kind of rested and humming sense of health that I sometimes feel, when I'm making good choices. My heart goes out to folks really struggling. The benefits really do start coming in - sobriety becomes it's own motivation. Just need to stay vigilant and be realistic about what we are handing over when we choose to use.",7,0

I’m finding it easier to let bad memories, regrets and negative thoughts float away and not ruminate on them all day long. My physical health is improving through exercise and trying to eat a little bit better. 

Sometimes I still feel like I’m going a little crazy. I’m still trying to learn how to love myself. I still feel like I’m stuck in a bit of a fog. I still feel down in the dumps during parts of the day. I still want to sleep in and never get out of bed. BUT, I’m making progress.

If you feel like giving up, don’t. It gets better. It just takes time. Focus on who you want to be and not who you no longer are.

I stopped when I started college- not wanting to smoke during school. 42 days into my break I smoked again and did not stop. 

I took another 7 day break in March but couldn’t hold that either once I started back again. But weed changed for me. Mary Jane was no longer a helper, but it was a constant thought in my head that I was doing wrong and questioned what I was doing with my life- I couldn’t stop. I cried when I smoked. Over time it enhanced my newfound anxiety like crazy. I still have anxiety, but now I do not have any drugs going into my body to alter my mind in any way. (I quit coffee too ;))

Well of course it kind of escalated and eventually I was buying off dark markets. Then smoking joints, eventually wife said need to slow down and I stopped for about a month with a couple slips which was pretty good. I felt good. 

Well that month was up so I bought some more and a bong. I got high last night and I just kind of realized what am I doing? I'm 35 and trying to work in the legal field, this could impact my future. What about my kids? One angry neighbor could impact how they live and I don't want my kids knowing about that. I know my wife doesn't like that I do it so often. 

It used to be something we did together every couple weeks and I do feel like it brought us closer and whatnot and it was fun to do it together but I feel like I have to admit I'm basically addicted to it. I don't wanna gear the nuance about what addiction is or isn't, I felt like I was allowing it to control my life. 

I'm done. By the end of the month I was clean I was glad I did it. I felt better, I didn't need weed to enjoy things. I wanna get back to that.

But not 2 days ago! I spent the whole day sober, still feeling like shit because I was hungover but didn't give in. Instead of smoking I went for a run in the morning, did some work, went for a walk for some lunch. I can't say it felt better than smoking all day but I'm proud of myself.

My second hurdle was not smoking with friends when we all hung out playing video games. I had a beer in me, was thinking the same old ""It's been a week, I'm fine now, I can smoke just a little bit"", but I didn't. 

I can't say I feel the best but I know I won't feel like this forever, I'll be seeing my family soon and I'll be able to be there and be present and enjoy time with them without thinking about smoking weed constantly.

Trying to escape the dopamine chase as a whole and have a healthier brain.,"Hi, first post, longtime lurker & problem smoker.

For context, I was over a month sober after seeing a therapist and sticking with a huge goal (graduating college). Since then, I've had a couple of week-long binge relapses and am back to day 9 of sobriety unceremoniously.

Writing this post to collect my thoughts and seek social support. The new problem I'm facing is gaming addiction -- The last two or three nights I've been essentially binge-playing video games at night which has stolen my time and is stealing my health (sleep & lack of workout). I guess it's not uncommon to have multiple addictions with less-than-stellar mental health.

My goal is to build a fresh new life because I'm moving back with family and looking for jobs and more friends. I think my biggest focus is being **more social** \-- I've almost willingly made myself a hermit by smoking and gaming in isolation.

I am trying to game in **moderation** but I've seen this in my mind before with weed. I expect to have somewhat similar withdrawal symptoms mentally (no insult -- I've dealt with the insomnia, fatigue, and complete lack of appetite -- I'm referring to the flux of negative emotions that the addictions have been burying). I suppose the only way to get through this is to wholly process my thoughts and feelings and let that crap go.

Can anyone else relate? I'm surprised to find such intersectionality with my addictions. *I am greatly looking forward to the benefits of my brain going back to normal in a year*. And hoping to build a life where I rarely if ever feel the urge to pick up the pen or controller to escape. Best wishes! Everyone stay strong!",9,0

It may sound completely unrealistic at first. It did to me. A few months ago *I struggled to make it 2 hours without lighting up. Now I have 66 days marijuana free.* I know it's not very long yet but for someone who previously spent every waking moment smoking, high, or in pursuit of weed, it blows my mind to think about myself now in comparison to when I was just a sad sack of smoke. It can only get better from here. You've got this. One day at a time.

TLDR; Positive self-talk, social support, distractions and hobbies (both new and old), having goals/things to look forward to, CBT, and therapy are helping.

It's not always easy. But, like anything, *you can practice and improve at sobriety.* Sometimes it crosses my mind what trying it again would do, but I *know* it will only lead to bad things. No benefits. No return on investment, in fact, overwhelmingly negative returns because it worsens my mental health, destroys my wallet, and deteriorates my relationships. Not worth the risk, not even in the slightest.

When I get a craving, I use what I call the ~Shut It Down~ method. I do recognize the craving, I don't pretend it's not there, but I immediately talk back to it and tell it who's boss. I don't give myself time to ruminate about it and debate it, because I already know how it goes every single time. I know now what I actually want for myself in that moment, no matter what it is, it CAN be addressed without getting high (usually it's wanting to not be lonely, to not be bored, to ""fit in"", to escape negative emotions, etc). So instead I tell it ""haha, nice try buddy, not happening"" and work on finding the proper, fulfilling solution. I remind it who's actually in charge around here. Because I spent the last 4+ years letting it boss me around, and it sucked, majorly. I'm sick of it controlling me. It won't happen again.

*I'm over it.* The longer I tell myself this, the more true it becomes.

When I spot the colors/symbols of a pot shop's sign, billboard, or social media ad, instead of curiously reading it and starting to entertain the notion of it, I look away. I immediately redirect my train of thinking to ignore it and start thinking about something else. ""Oh, that again. That stuff just isn't for me. I'm going to go do *hobby/talk to someone/coping skill* now and not give it another thought, because it always only leads down a bad path. See ya"". Treat it like you would an abusive ex trying to contact you. Instant Block. (Okay, maybe sometimes you're startled or caught off guard, and screenshot it to laugh at how sad/ridiculous it is at first... But then you say ""yeah, nah, you know what, fuck you, *I know by now that in reality you were SHIT*, get out of my life forever and don't come back."" /Block./ Bye. Good riddance). I don't give it space in my head to breathe. That space is for *me* to fill my life with important real things that actually matter to me.

I get to decide how I spend my days when I'm sober. Being addicted was hard work. Even though cravings hit now occasionally, some days stronger than others, overall, I feel much freer now in several ways. More money, more time, better sleep, a clear head, improved relationships, improved hobbies and career prospects, and improved self-respect/love. I know the effects that used to appeal to me from time to time would *not* be worth the way I romanticize my past enjoyment in my head because I *cannot* only have a little. It envelopes me in its deceptive, lying, scummy allure, and then, like a toxic lover, *it engulfs all of me, to the point of losing myself completely. I have no identity when I smoke except as someone who smokes 24/7, and it's sad.*

I want more for my life. And I *will* have it, even if it's not easy. Even if I have to redirect my thoughts Every. Damn. Day. No matter how many times I have to block them, I know with time it will become less and less frequent when it gets no response from me.

Your brain listens to you, so tell yourself ""You *can* do it"", and try to hear yourself out. The basis of CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) which helps many people with mental illnesses and addiction, is that with practice, you can train and control your thoughts. Not necessarily every single one, but you can control how you react to them, and follow them up with a different thought, and decide how you let them affect you, and build new patterns that become your instinctive response. When your old response to anything in life was to get high - it takes time, work, and lots of practice to improve at always saying NO and doing something else. But, the more frequently you tell yourself things, the more you'll believe them. You can live your best sober life. Your mind is resilient and adaptive. Take it slow, one minute, one hour, one day, one week, one month at a time.

Thanks for reading this. Do you have a go-to thought/phrase you tell yourself that helps you stop a craving? I'd like to hear what it is if so.

The best you is in there and I know you can find them. Keep building those thoughts and habits and coping skills and responses. Eventually, weed-related stuff will only bore/annoy you and will become a fleeting, forgettable thought, because you know it has zero benefit for you and isn't part of your life. The struggle is somewhat unique in a few ways, and everyone is different, but you are not alone. Be kind to yourself out there. You really deserve it. I'm rooting for you. 🍃",4,0

I knew I was addicted and I tried to quit half-heartedly several times but just kept falling back in. I hated myself for it but it was the only thing that kept me from wanting to die.

I ended up finding paganism and that got me to quit for real. I made up to my friends, finished college, and ended up in a long-term relationship with the love of my life.

Still, I dream about weed regularly. In my dreams, I'm right back at that place, emptying my bank account to just never come down. But I'm waking life, I never want to go back to that hell. Being high all the time wasn't living, it was wasting my life.

I just wanted to post this for all of you still early on in the process. Things do get better, your hobbies and music will start to feel good again and you can be happy without weed. Life can hurt, but man its nice to be able to feel at all.

The annoying thing about weed addiction is that you convince yourself that “next time I’ll eat better, next time I’ll have more self control” but no, once you’re high all that goes out the window and you just wanna eat anything without thinking through the consequences.. repeat for years and you now have serious health complications.

Read below for the TLDR

I'm 22 years old in college going into my senior year. I have struggled with anxiety for all of my life and have been depressed for most of my time in college. I have always had a hard time reaching out to people and making friends. My social anxiety in particular is through the roof and although it has gotten better over time it is a constant nuisance in my life.

I took my first hit around age 19 but then I became a heavy smoker starting my sophomore year of college and did not let up until the end of 2020. I smoked frequently every day for a year. By the summer after my sophomore year, I was probably averaging around 8 hits a day. I am a classic case of someone who has abused a substance as a way of coping with my inner demons.

My sophomore year I had a really big crush on a girl who was a friend of mine. She came over to our dorm every day to play video games. She went to my high school and had a lot of connections to people I knew and I felt like I had a pretty solid friendship. She was seeing my roommate and sleeping with him in our dorm. I told him my feelings after I thought they stopped seeing each other and then I tried to ask her out. I was rejected and I thought I could deal with that. Then, within a week they were back together and I walked into my dorm were having sex. It really messed with my head and it took me a long time to accept that I had resentment that was boiling under the surface.

I truly believe that weed really helped me with my social anxiety. I had an extremely low tolerance and acted pretty weird when I was high but I was taking pretty potent hits with a bong. I justified my low tolerance by smoking more because I wanted to feel cool. It was the first time in my life when I felt I truly fit in even though I realize now my ""friends"" didn't really care about me.

Then the friend that I had a crush on started dating a mutual friend. My roommate proceeded to complain to me about how he felt betrayed. It was around this moment that my mental health started to take a downturn and I snapped. My roommate dropped out of college soon after. Anyway, I told my friend that I liked her after she started dating this second guy because I thought they would respect that I felt spurned and that I needed time away from them. At the same time, I felt seriously hurt that my guy friend never reached out to me and did not respond to my efforts to hang out with him. I felt that hanging out with just him without his girlfriend was the only way that I could stay in the friend group, which I really wanted at the time. I felt neglected. I called him out multiple times for what I believed was flaky behavior. Then, over the summer I gave him a call where I basically went off on him, calling him a fake friend. I put all of my emotional investment into this friend group. So understandably when I felt that these people did not care about my mental well-being, I snapped.

I asked for forgiveness from the couple but also explained that I needed separation from them. But I was totally unrealistic and unwilling to accept that I needed to move on. That is when I started to truly abuse weed because it was the one thing that made me temporarily feel better and once I got over the tolerance hump I felt that it lessened my social anxiety to the point where I could meaningfully interact with people. During the fall of my junior year, I was desperately trying to save face and my place in the friend group when I asked if my guy friend wanted to hang out. I offered to show him my workplace and treat him to a meal. No response from him. Then desperately I tried to ask out his girlfriends' friend, who I was also sort of friends with. I got rejected again. She offered to hang out with me as part of the whole group. I explained myself to her and told her that my guy friend would not respond to me. I felt that she gaslighted me when she tried to convince me that he was not mad at me even though he would not communicate with me. I don't think she even knew the extent of the problem, though, and I don't blame her for her response. But I felt injured and wounded and empty. Later I find out that this girl and her roommates are no longer friends and I still feel responsible for that to this day.

I finally accepted that my mindset was toxic and that my relationship with these people was toxic but I continued to smoke. I started dating someone a month later and I got good grades. It wasn't until December when I opened up to my current girlfriend about smoking. Once she found out how I abused this substance, she was no longer comfortable with me smoking around my close friends from high school. I understood her concern. I was ashamed of myself for abusing a substance knowing that I was using it to cope with my feelings. However, I continued to go behind her back because it is so easy to relapse and I told myself that there was nothing bad about smoking with friends every two weeks or so. I felt and continue to feel guilty about it. To make matters worse, I believe that smoking has impacted my short-term and long-term memory which I am afraid I will never recover. I know this is long, so I appreciate anyone who read this far. For anyone who has had similar experiences, I would love to hear how you dealt with traumatic memories and abusing weed? Or has anyone had social anxiety that they have had to overcome without resorting to weed? I want to quit but I am not sure that I have the resolve. Any positive words would be appreciated. I know I messed up, and I know that there are consequences but I want to take control of my life now.

TLDR: I smoked heavily every day for the past year and now I am worried about the impacts on my short-term/long-term memory and how to deal with social anxiety without weed. Any constructive advice would be appreciated.",2,0

I am one year sober today. 
365 days of “just for today”.
365 days of unraveling, unlearning, and uncertainty. 
365 days of uninterrupted and unaltered presence. 

A year of unearthing and reclaiming the shadowy parts of myself and my story that I used substances to conceal and suffocate. 
I am far messier than I imagined myself to be. I am more imperfect than I ever cared to realize. I know less about who I am each day, but I do know that I am deeply flawed, deeply feeling, and deeply human- and I am awake to it all. I am excruciatingly, joyfully conscious. 

Sobriety is so much more than abstaining.
It is continuous spiritual excavation, and it is constant humility. 
It’s admitting I’m fucked up, and I’ve fucked up. 
It’s trying (and often failing) to cultivate self compassion so fierce and unconditional that it remains unwavering through recognition of the harm I’ve caused myself and other as a result of my addiction.  
It is never turning away, but turning within. 
It is relinquishing control and trusting that you will be held (oh, and you will). 

My sobriety is not just the most important thing in my life; it is the very foundation on which my life can flourish. It’s gives breath to all that matters to me. 

August second is my birthday because it is the day I chose to courageously step out of hiding and into my life.

Just need to get this off my chest.,"I've (M28) been smoking daily for 9 years, cigarette smoker for just as long. By daily, I mean minimum 5x/day, maximum I can't even give an accurate number (lived with basically a distributor in a college town when I was studying in a non-legal state. He was very generous with massive half ounce grinders just left about completely full for anyone to partake). Even contemplating an average number of 'X times daily' is hard now that I live in a legal state and can suck on a cart of high THC hash every 5 minutes.

Last year I started writing freelance for the first time in my life (originally a data analyst for pharma), moved out for the first time since college (destroyed 50k plus of student debt in the interim) from east coast to west (US), and started struggling immediately. Instead of hitting the breaks, I just started using other sort of legal uppers daily to balance the bud out. The initial decision to freelance wasn't because the specific work in itself was interesting (top 5 product reviews that redirect to BezosLand), but I figured it would open the door to self reliance and allow me to find a voice/write about things that are important to me. In fact, I'm in the process of paradoxically securing a freelance contract with a collective of journalists for data analysis work.

Yesterday, the brain fog just reached a tipping point, and to be frank, Ive been on the verge of tears or just balling my eyes out for the last 24 hours non-stop. I feel like I'm stuck in a viscious cycle of being so close to getting ahead on work, failing, and then doubling down on substance abuse, and falling further behind. at this rate, freelance writing is going to be exactly the same as data analysis for a specific company in an industry I despise: unfulfilling, stressful, and pointless. Ive tried to take breaks from some of the aforementioned substances here and there, but I just can't think of anything that's going to lead to the clarity I want and need in life other than cold turkey of all of them right now. 

Admittedly, I'm in really good shape physically and exercise can serve as an outlet, but I'm so fucking scared that the brain fog and poor memory is permanent. Like, I managed to get 2.5 miles running in this morning at a really good pace, but before leaving, I took my earbuds out of their case, lost them, and took 20 minutes to find them again. I tossed out all of my remaining THC weed, cigs and uppers last night and vaped some THC-free bud after the run to help with the multiple substance withdrawal, but I haven't even been able to log into my computer because currently I'm so scatterbrained, not to mention overwhelmingly ashamed of how much time I've wasted over the years.

I'm not really sure what I wanted to accomplish by writing this.. but I feel so alone. Detached from my community, my roommates, my parents, old friends.. my partner (F26) of the past 10 months is ditching weed too after consistently smoking since 13, so that helps. Maybe perspective from some people here who have smoked for as long and as frequently as me about getting some type of ""normal"" mental function back would calm me down.. I don't know.

All I know is that I can't avoid this anymore. Even though I'm scared that I won't be as productive without the uppers or I'll be missing out on some good short term feelings as far as weed that can't be recreated with other activities, I'm even more terrified that these substances are dictating the course of my life, and even limiting them to occasional use could start the viscious cycle all over again. I'm going to commit to at minimum posting every week in here to keep myself honest. I want to feel like a person again, not some husk going through the motions of life, on the brink of financial, mental, and emotional crisis. Based on the inspiring posts and supportive comments, I think I'm in the right place",12,0

I’m a super consistent stoner. I smoke daily and I never really hated it before last night. I made a mistake. A huge mistake. 

My puppy that I got around this time last year got into my infused joints and she ate three out of the five of them. I’ve been monitoring her all night (she ate them at around 2am) and called the vet to see if I should go in. The vet said she should be fine, just super drowsy and loopy and that’s exactly how she’s been. 

It’s my fault. I’m not going to say anything otherwise because it’s time I start taking accountability for my actions, even when I was high. 

I decided last night that I was going to stop. The whole reason she got into them was because I went outside to smoke a couple joints. 

I know it’s going to be hard to sober up but I’d love any tips if anyone has them. 

And if you’re going to give me your opinions on what happened, go ahead. I know what happened was bad. And for those thinking ‘I don’t think it’s that bad’ my vet said if she would’ve ate the whole pack there’s a chance she would’ve gone into a coma. It was bad. I take full responsibility for it. I’m learning from it.",7,0

My energy level is so much higher and I already can't imagine going back to my old stoner lifestyle.

I've been experiencing these mild ""flashbacks"" where I feel just a tiny bit high... not enough to really interrupt my day, but enough to be noticeable. I thought it was placebo at first, but while listening to music today I realized I was 100% feeling something. I'm assuming it is because I have been exercising daily and eating a lot less due to decreased appetite (don't worry, I'm not starving myself, still eating 3 meals a day), and this is releasing THC stored in my fat cells.

These flashbacks don't really bother me and aren't tempting me to smoke. However, I'm curious to hear from others who have experienced this. How long should I expect to experience these? Is the intensity/longevity of these flashbacks proportional to the amount of fat I am burning? I put on like 12 pounds since the pandemic started and was smoking consistently throughout that whole time - will all of that fat release THC as I burn it? Or does the THC burn off more quickly?",9,1

The worst part is the emotional attachment I have to weed and my past experiences I felt were enhanced by the drug - In rehab/recovery spaces they call it ""euphoric recall""

Waiting for a ride in a deserted parking lot at 3am after a night of drinking. Being pretty much anywhere at 3am. Staying home with a cold, and spending the day watching comfort movies and slice of life anime while eating spicy soup. Being alone in the house, listening to music. Waiting for the bus downtown in the morning before the city really starts to wake up.

These are all moments I've had to live through again in the past 3 weeks, this time without THC to ""enhance"" them, and they're moments that I will inevitably have to live through countless times in the future.  
I still love and enjoy these parts of my day, but right now they are slightly tainted with the craving/nostalgia for weed. Looking forward to being able to enjoy them purely soon.

The best part has been all of the dreams! I have these vivid, metaphorical and frankly weird dreams every single night and I can usually remember them if I don't get up too soon. I start EMDR therapy in September and it's probably one of the biggest motivators to keep going because most professionals agree EMDR is not compatible with cannabis and THC use can make it less effective.

I mostly just need a rant / more personal advice because I feel like every attempt I make drives me partially insane. A few months ago I made it almost 2 weeks but that feels impossible now. 

When COVID first blew up in March my girlfriend at the time and I moved back into my parents house as finances increased but we never got further than a plan during COVID with our 9-5 jobs. I live with my ex and our relationship was centered around weed towards the second year until I finally broke it off. She developed a strong dependency on pot and refuses to take it out of the house or give it up for a few hours, but when I try to quit she just makes me feel horrible about it and myself which causes me to cave back in. The “oh you should be strong enough to quit if you really wanted to” argument is the one that gets my blood boiling along with a few other argument she puts up to defend her usage in the house. I also won’t kick her out because she would have nowhere to go which is a terrifying thought.

We haven’t talked for about a week because i’m at a breaking point and I want to quit so badly but everyone keeps telling me that i’m a shitty person for not helping her out. I don’t know what do do anymore except smoke with her until she is feeling better or block everyone out but that only seems to make it harder. It feels quite pointless to smoke now but I always find myself smoking at least once a day. Today’s attempt started with an immediate wave of anger at nothing and proceeded to become worse. I tried my morning jog, played some games, read a book, and now I’m here. I just feel really desperate to quit. Any advice on how to handle this situation is greatly appreciated!! Thank you!",4,2

Relapses may happen. Have compassion for yourself if it does. Punishing yourself for smoking will probably make it worse.

Cohabitated with ex after separation for 5 months, and they were pissed and hostile. On top of that, I learned that my work contract would not be renewed next year because I am not performant enough. Yay me!

Anyway, pot helped me go through the divorce, but it's been taking an increasing part of my life. Up until 3 days ago, I was smoking day and night every couple of hours. I became the pothead parents warn you about. I was planning my social activities around pot. When people wanted to stop by to say hi, I was pretending I was not home or sick to hide the fact that I was high.

Three days ago, I got so tired of it that I collected all of my pot equipment and threw it in a dumpster across the street. I tried to retrieve it that night when I could not sleep, but it was gone. Having the urge to go dumpster dive for pot sealed the deal for me: I am a fucking addict and I need to stop this before it destroys my life.

I'm only 3 days in, but that's the most I have been able to do in years. I have noticed I am very irritable. Yesterday, my dog was just staring at me while I was eating, and I yelled at her to leave the room. I was irrationally angry, like she was provoking me or something. Someone said something at work and I misinterpreted their intention and got upset. Here as well, thought someone was provoking me.

That's the bad thing. The interesting part, though, is that a lot of good things have happened since I stopped. It's only been 3 days, so it's really neat that my life is already improving. I thought I'd share these things with you to cement my will to stop. Here it is:

1. I can finally breathe. I don't feel like my lungs are full of ashes anymore.
2. I am not tired. I used to be tired all day, every day.
3. I can fall asleep without pot, which I am very happy about as someone who struggles with sleep.
4. I have a lot more time available, which is good because I have neglected my hobbies.
5. Kissing me is not like kissing an ashtray anymore.

Anyway, there are probably others, but these are enough for me to want to stop. I finally have a shot at leaving this behind. If you have any words of wisdom or encouragement, please write them below.

And yet, I am constantly internally at war with myself, always judging, always hating, always disappointed with my inability to walk away from this drug, this thing that has invaded almost every thought and feeling since I was a teenager. I always feel stuck and sad and enslaved. 

I haven’t read a book in almost 2 years and used to read a book every week or two. I don’t pursue hobbies. I have been considering seeing what other jobs are out there but cannot seem to motivate to update my resume. I spend many evenings stoned in front of the TV after my daughter goes to bed. I smoke during the workday more often than not these days. While it doesn’t impact my ability to do my job on a basic level, it certainly impacts my motivation to go above and beyond.

I often worry about how this is impacting my brain’s ability to remember my children’s childhoods. I often worry about how this is impacting my sex life with my wife. I often worry about the fact that I can’t go an hour without wanting to get high above all other things. 

My wife knows I smoke to sleep and is fine with that but is not aware of my smoking during the day. That’s what tipped me off that I am an addict. I hide things. I have been hiding how much I consume for years. While I don’t objectively consume a lot of weed, I secretly consume more than anyone knows. Sneaking downstairs at 3am on a weekday to spark up outside the basement door because I can’t sleep can really bring a flood of realization and self-awareness. My brain exhibits occasional moments of clarity during moments like this and says “replace weed with liquor right now, and tell me how you see yourself.” 

I had quit all the things at the end of 2019 but after a few months of COVID lockdown in 2020, I was soon back to square one. 

I need to get back off this crazy train again. This place could help.

EDIT: I wanted to add that quitting is complicated by my primary insomnia which has been pretty severe for the past 12 years or so. My mind doesn’t let me sleep. I have tried all the sleep remedies and “good sleep hygiene” habits, and they pretty much all have failed to some extent. 

The only sure fire sleep solution for me is weed. This makes the thought of quitting especially foreboding for me since I know I will be starting out that journey with 1-2 weeks of quite literally no sleep.",15,2

It’s almost like Weed is an imaginary friend.,"I’m a long time lurker here and I will probably continue making these posts until I figure this stuff out. I managed to force myself to make it through the day yesterday without picking up. I just ran out and I usually plan so that I have more as soon as I run out. But yesterday I wanted to see if I could make it a day without it. I still smoked some Kief and had beers but it’s a good step I think.

I ended up caving in tonight as my dealer just re-upped again. It’s not ideal but I realized that I make the biggest realizations on those sobering nights. I couldn’t wait to reup again, until the hours before meeting up. As soon as my dealer confirmed a time, I felt a sense of panic and sadness. When I withdrew the cash for weed, I felt shame and disappointment. 

I have this overwhelming fear sometimes that I can’t make significant changes in my life while smoking. This is especially true regarding relationships. I come from a toxic family, so I’m not very close to any of them. I haven’t had a close friend in years. The majority of my relationships seem superficial. I still have fun with them, but I feel like they’d cancel for better plans. All in all weed has made me feel like a complete and total outcast.

I just watched a YouTube video, the guy talks about teens not having meaningful relationships due to social media. He talked about their lack of meaningful relationships. He talks about how teens will turn to devices rather than people when they face stress in life. I couldn’t help but liken this theory with weed, Ive always turned to weed instead of people when I’m stressed.

They like to call it Mary Jane making it seem like a lover. They even say it’s like a friend who’s always there. But let’s be honest, it’s just a plant. It’s like an imaginary friend that makes me feel comfortable being lonely. I’d rather be with a plant than people. This just seems pathetic as hell.

But I’m 25 now and I don’t have many close relationships. I sometimes think it’s too late, which makes me smoke more. I think what’s the point, it’s not like I have any close friends. The worst is that still hung around people this summer, but I still felt lonely. It felt like I wasn’t connecting with them as I was high, I was just there. 

Now I sit here alone with a quad of weed. I just spent half my paycheck so it’s hard to just toss it. And the worst part is that I still enjoy it. I want to tell myself that I can still smoke and live a meaningful life but it hasn’t happened yet. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results, which basically sums up my experience with weed.

I just graduated college and I was able to avoid smoking every day because I became an alcoholic. I’d almost rather drink alcohol l than weed, as it doesn’t affect my state of mind in the same way. But I went through some struggles with alcohol so now I’m back on weed as a way to be safer. I’m not getting in trouble anymore and have less conflict. I can’t say that’s a bad idea, but it’s hard going back to a substance you’ve been on for years, even if it’s to quit a more dangerous drug.

I’m probably going to smoke the rest of this because I’ve had a terrible week. But I want to start thinking of a plan, so as soon as I run out I don’t get more. Because most of the times I relapsed from not having a plan. I still kept most of my paraphernalia and it just made things harder. I think I need to find a hobby that will make me feel happy without substances. Because I haven’t made much time for hobbies, weed has been my only pastime outside of going out with friends or working.",32,0

I grew up in a very traditional household where I have never even heard my family members say any kind of cuss words, never drank, DEFINITELY never did drugs. I grew away from their thinking, while still pretending I was just like them.

Discovering weed was awesome man.. no hangover, no real side effects whatsoever, and it was the perfect way to relax after a day of working. Over the past few months, however, I realize I can’t do anything once I smoked. I am already a serial procrastinator, but once I smoke after work, I throw off all duties and responsibilities.. This is an issue that I knew was there, but shrugged off and thought “oh I’ll cut back, and only smoke right before I go to sleep”. Nothing has really changed however, even though I cut back slightly. Fast forward to last night.

My new roommate is a MAJOR pothead and hit me up about about smoking and hanging out. I was exhausted from lack of sleep but I decided to just go with it. He shows me that he had gotten some super potent stuff from a legal state, so I get excited.. we roll up a cone and go to work on it.

This weed was beautiful, and harsh; both a massive necessity and a nightmare. I didn’t just get paranoid, or anxious, I finally got what so many people talk about when they say “high amounts of cannabis show you things you’re too afraid to confront”. It finally set in, that I had been two-faced to my family my whole life.. pretending to be one way while truly being another. I had gone from someone who wrote poetry, played piano, obsessed over physical activity and dreamt of the future, to a caricature of complacency. All I had become focused on was getting through the day so the weed could relax me. I had turned into the exact thing I had always reviled. 

This morning, I woke up and chose not to be disheartened as I had the night before.. but this stupid fucking plant that had begun to ruin my life, was actually the window through which I saw my future. I am now determined to stop smoking, and get my life in order, and forge myself into a man I respect, and eventually, love.

Marijuana, I hate you, and thank you.

I have been contemplating quitting weed for some time now and when I discovered this board about a week ago reading through many of your experiences gave me the motivation that I needed. I have been smoking near daily since I was around 15, dabbling in it from the age of 13, except for a summer when I was in my early 20s. I am now 33 and am tired of feeling like a shadow of a person. My IQ feels like it has dropped significantly, it has affected my speech, my confidence, my ambition, and every relationship I have in my life. I am just so done with it, I am ready to find myself again and pick up the pieces. I know I am only 5 days in, but things haven’t been so bad. I have had cravings, no doubt, but I have been keeping myself busy and that seems to help. I guess I just have a few questions for those who have been down this path. Will my sleep eventually normalize? Will my dreams become less vivid and bizarre, my sleep less broken? Will I be able to recoup some of my lost intelligence? Will I lose my slight, intermittent stuttering? I know that I have smoked for so long that it probably will have some long term affects on me, if not permanent, but it would be nice to know that things will eventually normalize a bit. I know some of these questions have likely been answered before on this forum, I am quite new to Reddit so if there are any threads that answer them in detail that someone could point me to it would be much appreciated.

Been smoking about 10-12 bongs a day for past 4 years. I’m happy I’m sober but don’t get me wrong I miss the feeling of comfort that came with being a sober. 

Anyways I’m writing on here cause I’ve been faced with something I didn’t think would happen. 

My best friend who I consider a brother barely speaks to me anymore. I’ve known him for 5 years and we were always smoking , dealing and doing anything to do with weed together. Since I’ve got sober I haven’t even received any support or messages from him. I’m not saying I expect it but it would of been nice considering how he understands the struggle I’ve been going through for the past few years. Also when I ever meet him and his girlfriend (I’m also very close with her)  he seems to zone out on his phone and just act like I’m only there for her. 

It’s makes me so sad as we’ve never been this distant with each other. I look back on our friendship and worry we were only friends cause we liked to smoke and drink together. Like he’s still living how I used to, partying, selling and smoking like crazy. I understand he has his own shit to deal with but I miss what we had and I fear it’ll never come back.
I’ll admit I did have to distance myself from him a lot once I got sober cause whenever I would hang out with him and other friends he would be buying big crates of beer and saying stuff like “after gym we’re gonna smoke a few spliffs. He knows I’m sober and I just wish he could’ve been there a bit more for me.
Ive become I bit isolated because of this and I just want to know has anyone else experienced this and how did they deal with it.",2,0

I'm going to try and quit again for what feels like the millionth time. I've been smoking everyday for a little over 3 years and it makes me feel like crap now and has been for awhile now.

It feels like I just smoke cuz it's familiar and I think it'll make me feel good like it used to, but instead I turn passive and get lost in this fog within my head. Being high all the time makes small tasks seem like climbing a mountain; I'll take out the trash or check my mail and literally feel like I've done enough for the day which justifies me smoking more and sitting around.

I've never made it more than two weeks without smoking, but I know I can't do this to myself anymore so I need to get my control back. It's been the hardest it has ever been because I've been having pain my left testicle from a hydrocele (that I can't get help with because no health insurance anymore) and left side pain under my ribcage which I've been to the emergency room twice for and now they think might be H pylori, but the antibiotics haven't taken the pain away so we'll see. I've been continuing to smoke to try to help manage the pain, but it doesn't really help, and I'm worried I'll cause myself more pain with withdrawals if I quit. However, if it's not helping then why subject myself to a habit that enables me.

Today is day 1 and all I'm focusing on is managing my pain, I honestly believe I could easily quit if I didn't have the other lingering medical issues. I just want to feel like my true self again and not feel like I need weed to have fun or to do anything. 

This thread has been encouraging me to quit through everyone's story, so now it's time for me to make the leap. Good luck everyone :)",2,0

Posted a couple of days ago about my relapse and how terrified I was to tell my partner that I had been smoking again. I thought I could get through withdrawals without her finding out and then never smoke again. Well, I relapsed every single day because I was as sick as my secrets. The anxiety of quitting combined with the anxiety of her finding out that I had relapsed combined into a hellish ball of despair.

Folks, telling her was the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. I've relapsed so many times and finally had some time under my belt... I felt like if I told her, she would lose all hope and leave me. But she didn't. Was she upset? Yes, of course. She was crying and felt betrayed. But she was upset because I didn't tell her sooner and because I lied about it, not because I relapsed. She understands that I'm an addict struggling with addiction. 

After having a heart-to-heart last night and promising it won't happen again, I slept through the whole night straight for the first time in days. I woke up today with anxiety and nausea, but also the resolve that I will never smoke again. If you put a joint in front of me right now, I would throw it in the trash even though my body is physically craving it because there's absolutely NOTHING weed can do for me anymore other than destroying my life and relationships. I know that if I pick up again, I can't control when I will put it back down or be honest with myself and others. My integrity goes out the window as soon as I light up that first joint.

If you've relapsed, tell someone you love and trust. I promise that their reaction probably won't be as negative as your addict brain is telling you. Never quit quitting. Eventually, it will click.",8,0

Being sober makes you realize how many things you were covering up with your addiction, and how much time is available in each day 

Started exercising, taking vitamins, no fap, and focusing on what my dreams are and what I really want in life.

I always used carts as my main vice and for over 2 years I got them from the cool dude, friend of a friend of a friend type deal. One day I decided to Google the info on the cart box and come to find out it's typical fake street cart packaging. 

Now those carts alwahs did have a weird sort of ""chemical"" tast to them. In Dec 2020 I attempted to quit weed and dealt with all the horrible side effects. Waking up soaking wet, vivid unbelievable nightmares, irratibility, stomach issues, etc. After about 3 days I couldn't take it and started smoking flower again just to help.

After a month of just flower, I went back to carts but this time legal ones. I'm in Illinois so legal weed is still new and prices haven't lowered yet. Before I'd get 2 1gram carts for $100 and at the dispensary I was laying $160 for a single 1 gram cart. But at least I knew it was government approved and clean and I could tell the high felt less ""chemically"".

So that's what I was smoking all 2021 up until 4 days ago. When I quit those, I felt like a fucking truck hit me on day 1. Didn't sleep a wink night 1 and barely at all night 2. But by day 3 I felt pretty good and was able to eat. Night 3 I was able to sleep 10 hours. 

No vivid dreams (I am having normal ones now but totally benign), no night sweats, no irratibility, no headaches. On day 4 I feel like I have energy and barely any withdrawl effects except for no appetite still.

 I wanted to see if anyone's experience matches mine. I have a hypothesis that fake street carts may actually cause way worse withdrawal symptoms than legal carts. Maybe due to the odd chemicals in them? Or maybe this time quitting I just happened to get really lucky and not experience withdrawals for more than a couple days?

I had the same smoking habits on the legal vs street btw. Vaping all day everyday pretty much.",3,0

I’ve been really struggling with a sleeping related issue, but it’s not insomnia like I see most people dealing with. I feel like I’ve replaced my weed addiction with a sleeping addiction.

I realize this is probably just a discipline issue. I just need to get out of bed and get moving. I used to motivate myself out of bed with a morning bowl. But now the feeling of my cozy bed replaces that, and no matter how determined I am, I can’t seem to fight it.

I'm 46M who has been smoking, on and off, since a teenager, and became a daily smoker at 18 or 19. Had a break in my 30s but have been smoking consistently for the last 7 years or so. For the last year and a half, I only indulged at night to help me sleep, and it was only 1-3 tokes a night. I think that greatly helped my chances, in reducing the withdrawal, even though I still had to suffer through that - many more times than was necessary, actually.

Quitting was very stop-start, early in the year. I went something like 6 days sober, then 2 days smoking, then 18 days sober, 1 day smoking, 2 and 2, 11 and 1 - it went on like this for a while. Eventually it went 3 days sober, 2 days smoking, 1 day off, 1 day on, and at this point I could see I was in danger of slipping back completely, so I stopped entirely when I realised that.

I wouldn't recommend doing it that way, because I just lengthened the withdrawal process and had to go through another withdrawal every time I stopped after a relapse. But for anyone who has struggled with relapse in the early days, maybe my story will give you hope, that you can still make it through if you stay determined.

I've barely had a craving since then. I just feel so much better and never want to go back. About a month ago I smelt some and it completely grossed me out - kind of like tobacco does, after being a ciggie smoker up to the age of 33. I think that's a good marker.

It felt as if the past 3 months were much longer than usual. I attribute this to being sober during this time. 

When I relapsed I had all sorts of delusions the first one was I was only going to buy 1 cartridge a month. No matter what I would not buy another one, and what do you know I broke that. The next idea was to only smoke once a day, blew past that. Then back to smoking all the time as I did before, killing a full gram cartridge in less than a week is not good! I took a week break around a month ago, and that was very rough I was craving weed really bad and had a hard time going to sleep, as usual, increased anxiety etc. Even after this I still decided to smoke again, now I am at the point where I know I can not control my usage, quitting fully is the only option for me. 

It is weird to say even just typing it out on Reddit, as weed seems like a close friend to me. Not meaning I used weed to cope with emotions or etc, I always smoked because I enjoyed it not to escape from anything. More along the lines, of it, always being there. 

&#x200B;

I have dreams of growing weed when I am older, so I can smoke as much as I want. I find a lot of my thoughts are based on weed. 

As I type this out I want to smoke and I know it will get easier and eventually I will pass my 3 months I just hope this time I do not come back to weed. 

&#x200B;

Sorry for being all over the place this is just what came to mind! 

TLDR: Went sober for three months relapsed and now going sober again.

This is my first time posting here. I have had a couple of failed attempts at stopping over the last year or so. This time feels different, I'm feeling ready.

However, the worst temptation hits at night while I'm laying in bed, unable to sleep.

I was wondering if you lovely lot would be able to provide me with some advice on getting some sleep and kicking the temptation in the ass.

Best of luck and good wishes to you all.

It is impossible to imagine a thought more truly and universally applicable to human affairs than that expressed in these memorable words, or more descriptive of that perpetual oscillation from good to evil, and from evil to good. 

After procrastinating and failing my own promises repeatedly over the past 2 years I started another attempt today. I’ve resolved to quit 100s of times before today only to make an excuse and light up within hours. Ah, I’ll be a monk from tomorrow, I’d convince myself trivially and just punt it to the next day. 

My first binge many 4 years ago was supposed to be only a couple of days. It ended up being 3 months long and was only broken by external circumstances. My second binge was also similar. I told myself that the first time wasn’t really *done* done as I had to stop it abruptly. So I wanted to do *properly one last time*. It ended being another 3 month binge. 

The third binge started 2019 around thanksgiving. It still hasn’t ended. I have had breaks of 2 months and 1.5 months in between. But that’s about it. I feel so bad for all the time I’ve lost. What was I doing where did that time go? Fuck…. 

I graduated 4 years ago I have relocated twice internationally since then. Adjusting to a different country is difficult. It’s very isolating. You don’t know anyone or anything. If you do it twice, you basically feel like you’re living in a videogame, getting spawned in random places. Imagine moving to a different country only to spend next 1.5 years in a tiny room due to a pandemic. Immense detachment from reality, not being part of any community, dispersion and loss of school friends, realisation  that my parents don’t really care about me, quarter life crisis about what to do next, career pressures and adulting in general is all too much man. 

I’m a successful professional who makes good money.  I have worked so hard to get where I am. Honestly you could make a movie out of my story. I wouldn’t hurt a fly. I’ve always tried to help out, I donate lots to charity. I did everything correct. Yet here I am. I’ve been through so much and I’ve been through it all alone. Not a soul to empathise. I have no one. No one to share success or failure. I have no one that recognises me for what I truly am. I could vanish tomorrow and not a single thought would be spared for me. My disappearance would be a non-event. 

Anyway none of this justifies my addiction. Nor does it fix anything. Weed to me is what an eject button is to a fighter pilot. When things get tough I abandon the scene in one hit. Honestly, weed feels like a warm embrace. Just what I’ve been missing. However it’s time to be real. That embrace has gone on for too long. I feel suffocated now. I don’t like the feeling I get when I realise how much of my life and energy has gone into weed. 

Good news is that today I started. I’ve said *one last time* only to fail again too many times these past months. Today was a bit different. I was on my way to buy some more weed but somehow the cool breeze and sunshine made me think hard. I really don’t want to be this guy. So I came back home empty handed and I’m writing this. My previous binge withdrawals tell me that the next few days will be really bad. The worst. But I should remember “this too shall pass”. 

(I hope to write more as a cope with these emotions and issues. I hope I can use this community to journal my journey and maybe help someone else along the way. Hope it’s not an issue).",14,1

Does anyone have tips for staying motivated / abstaining on days where it doesn't seem worth it to invest in yourself?

I don't count everyday, but I have an app that I occasionally look at for reference.  That last relapse started around the beginning of the pandemic impact where I live.  I leaned too hard into the spirit of zoom happy hours. 

**The tiny habit**

I am making time each morning to list out three things I am grateful for.  Usually these are items that come to mind when thinking back to my previous day.  This small habit has been a great way to have a brief moment with my own thinking before I let the rest of the worlds information flow in (news, internet, etc).  Output before input. 

**Do I still think about using?**

I have had some brief moments of thinking it would be ok to use again. As if this time I would be able to control it?!? But generally they are just weak impulses.  These thoughts can be triggered by almost nothing and are hard to track down.  Some of it feels like it could be related to nostalgia and longing for the past. When these urges come, I instinctively think about how much better off things have been in my life since I stopped. I also think of how dark I was feeling during my last two relapses. 

**Staying connected to the community**

I have also been spending time sorting /r/leaves by new and looking for low participation posts.  It helps keep me focused on this community of peers that truly understands The Affliction. I see it as a 27/7 support group as well as an outlet for me to give back.  Service is an important facet of my recovery.

As part of learning to build programs with Python, I made a script that looks for zero reply posts and opens new browser tabs for me. I did this to cut down on the wasted time and energy of visually scanning the page. I am self aware enough of my ADHD tendencies to see that I am using this whole ""leaves sort by new thing"" to avoid what I am supposed to be working on.  Yet I am not stopping myself as per normal. At least the python script helped with one of my personal growth goals.

When I got my vaporizer I could smoke whenever I wanted even when I lived with my parents (they think weed is so dangerous and you can get fuck your head up from the first time etc.). I just went in our bathroom to vape out of the little window there. From there to this day, I have been smoking almost everyday.

Now when I have lived by myself for few months I have realized that only thing I do is  go to work, go home, smoke, go to sleep. Every little task feels like a big mission, every human interraction is like Im there but really I just want to go home smoke more. My mum has said that I've changed but only now I realized that it is true. I'm so antisocial and passive and I want to get back to times when life was about doing things for fun, not about smoking weed first to make doing things fun.

Anyway now it is day 2. I have tried to stop smoking once before this (I dont count T-breaks) and it has been pretty easy because I have night shifts this week so I dont really have urge to smoke cause night shifts you basically just go to work to go back home to sleep to wake up and go to work again. If I didn't have workplace to go distract my brain, I think it would be impossible to quit. I know the urges will come but I dont want to be this zombie anymore.

I have been smoking for about 6 years (23 F)  and it mostly started as a way to mask my depression and anxiety in order to not put a burden on my parents when my little brother was put into prison.  From there it escalated into a full blown dependency. 

in the last couple of months I have pursued a new career day trading and have realized how much the cycle of smoking, then drinking caffeine and then smoking again to quell anxiety has become extremely unhealthy.  This anxiety caused me to lose a decent amount of my savings and somehow I still felt numb and out of touch with the whole situation.  

I finally decided I need to prioritize my mental health and actually get to the root of why I struggle so much. I'm grateful to this sub because like a lot of the posts I've read, many people don't think weed is a big problem, but deep down I knew it has been becoming one for me for a while.  

The main issue I've faced so far is my anxiety increasing for the time being and my nicotine usage going up, but I think that's due to the oral fixation of smoking.

I’ll go first:

- Hummus with red peppers/broccoli/carrots . Soo yummy and savory.

-halo top ice cream most are like 300 cals or less and I’m satisfied with just a few spoonfuls.

-oreo thins… instead of munching half a box of Oreos I notice the thins offer the same satisfaction if I just eat two tiny Oreos or mix it in my ice cream  :) 

-kombucha 

-sparkling water

-trail mix omg. I use to hate trail mix with cranberries and dried fruit and idk now I love it..

The good numb feeling we all like so much, being zoned out of our thoughts and zoned into a video game or other distractions.

The familiar feeling of our problems seemingly fading away. Thoughts that were nagging us become background chatter that is easily ignored.

But at the same time, I become extremely anxious of the future, feel regrettable about the past and loath how I am spending my time at the present moment.
Worse than that is how socially awkward, anxious and paranoid I feel after having smoked.

Going outside of my room seems impossible and an extremely frightening experience. I often forgo social interactions because I hate myself when high so much that I would rather vanish than talk to anyone.

When coming down from my evenly sessions, it's often late in the night and I start to have quite negative self-talk. Sometimes to the point of suicidal ideations and just being really mean to myself.

When I am using, I am only a shell of myself. This is not me. I learned to cope with this version of myself, but this is not truly who I am. I like to hang out with my friends, but the high version of me really does not.

I like to experience new things, but the high version of me just wants that comfort at home.

To get the real me back, I need to give up this high version of myself. I want to give up my drug addiction, to be more in line with my true self again. I want to rid myself of the paranoia and anxiety that lately has been ruling my life.

It started off slow, but it eventually became a daily habit. I didn’t consider it an addiction, but it became my entire personality. I started college 3 years ago and it’s become a morning to night habit. I stopped answering calls from my family because I was too stoned to have a normal conversation. I stopped responding to my friends and eventually lost all of them. I stopped driving anywhere because I was always fucked up. It left me feeling incredibly isolated and incompetent. What a lonely life. 

I began therapy about 3 months ago and was finally honest with myself. I hated myself, couldn’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I thought I was better off dead and constantly wished I was never born. Through therapy, I was able to work through trauma and begin daily habits that made me feel good. Daily exercise, meditation, and yoga gave me a sense of purpose and confidence. Journaling was a great outlet. Meal prepping every week gave me energy and I started to lose weight. The munchies pretty much made that impossible though. 

Last week, I finally said enough is enough. I threw away my stash and told my family about my addiction. Now I’m a week clean and I want to reflect on those 7 days. 

Day 1-3 were absolutely brutal. I thought about buying more and giving up. Really didn’t think I’d make it through. I was exhausted, very angry and sad, and had such brain fog it was hard for me to do much. I stayed in bed and cried a lot. 

Day 4 I went to the pool and drank kombucha. The night was hard for me, but I started having incredible sleep and vivid dreams. 

Day 5-6 I napped for several hours and slept 9 hours through the night, but there was no temptation. I finally felt like I could do this. I started feeling happier and more like myself. I still had brain fog. 

Today is day 7. We’ll see what the day brings, but I’m happy to say that I’m beginning to feel like myself again. I’m excited to get to know the real, sober me again.

You may be restless but now that means you have all this energy that before was mostly complacency and laziness.

Our addiction (because we have to start calling it what it is) is not stronger than us or our will to change our lives for the better.

Talked to my friends and family about my sobriety and mental health. Received a lot of support and empathy. 

Started seeing a new person and have made a great connection. We kissed for the first time yesterday and I didn't have to worry about my breath tasting like an old roach. 

Started playing guitar again and can actually remember the songs I write. I've played guitar for 15 years and I don't have one song I can call my own. Usually it's a big epiphany of a new song followed by cloudy memories and misremembering when I try and play it the next day.

I am on vacation and with my crew of stoner friends.  They are all supportive of my abstinence.

I see them smoking I feel both envy and pity.  They are all better at moderation than I ever was, which I envy. However despite that I can see how it consumes a large part of their identity, budget, and planning.

I still love the powerful medical plant.  But it's just not for me.

I have had no cravings even while I am around them while they enjoy it!

For those on this sub still struggling, know there is a light at the end of the tunnel and there is no one size fits all solution.

Often weed is used as a mental band aid.  I used it that way during my teens- early twenties to deal with social anxiety.  My 5 years clean allowed me to discover that I don't need to be anxious, just be true to myself and people will notice that and be drawn to me. My true self will also push away people who are worth my time. My march 2020 relapse was clearly based on covid anxiety!

Although covid is still occupying a large amount of my own headspace, being clean is actually much better. Even with the troubling news coming from the CDC.

And it's probably not a good idea to smoke while there's a global pandemic, which technically is a respiratory virus that literally kills people by suffocating them.

I come from a family that is very open about alcohol and weed use. Except my younger brother and his wife none of us are/were regular smoker. 

But two years ago I got into the habit of taking a drag a day, then it became more and more and before I knew it, it was having detrimental effects on my career, my social life and my happiness in general.

I tried to reduce my use a few times, I tried to regulate but I don't think it really works.

The breaking point came when I got into a big fight about cannabis use on my birthday 6 months ago, smoked too much, hallucinated and called the cops in distress. I was lucky there wasn't a bigger issue, the 911 operator and the cops that finally came around to our house were accepting of someone having a total breakdown under the influence at the height of the pandemic.

But the next day when I woke up, I decided to do better, I threw away every ounce of weed I had and let my family know of my intentions to quit.

I let them know that this did not mean that I had any judgement towards them or expected to them to quit. It was just a matter of introspection after the previous night's events and they understood or atleast for the last 6 months have pretended to understand (again with the exception of my younger brother and his wife)


I have been squeaky clean, I finished a big project at work and have been given paperwork for a promoted job position starting September. My wife and I have started travelling more, being in the nature more, I've become a kickass badminton player (not pro, but I can give anyone in my social circle a run for their money) and I feel much healthier in general.

I'm happy, and not just, ""absent in the moment, suppressing my problems happy"" like I was with weed.

I'm actually happy,  ""present in the moment, know what I want, know what I have happy""

Always been a neurotic anxious person and weed suppressed all that for the most part. Having to deal with life on life’s terms sometimes can be very scary but I don’t have a choice. 
Here are some things that have kept me sober and maybe some will recognize. 
1. Vanity- I’m an attractive guy. Weed took something away from that and why not represent yourself the best you can physically. 
2. Sleep- also tied to vanity. But quality sleep which I haven’t had in years and years. I had night sweats when I was smoking. If I didn’t smoke enough then that did something to my nervous system. The nightmares have become very infrequent when a few months ago I accepted they’d just always be there. 
Career- I work in tv and have only worked more since quitting. 
Relationship- I’m in a relationship that I’m learning a lot about myself from it. It may or may not work out but I would be all alone if not for quitting. 
Attention span- I can put on a random show or movie now and watch it as opposed to rewatching the same comforting shows that I’ve seen before. Which I still do but my pallet has grown.

The brunt of it is wack brain chemicals, but It's an amplification of existing feelings regarding real events and regrets. And it doesn't change the fact that it feels fucking terrible *right now*. 

Would y'all humor me and give some positive thoughts about the world that makes you happy? 

I'll list mine: 

1. I don't have to worry about having a roof over my head 

2. Fresh air after a rainstorm smells nice 

3. I got a haircut today, it was a nice experience and new hair looks great 

4. I have people that love me

5. Fresh tomatoes are tasty

Have never felt so unstoppable, I didn’t realize it at first but I was holding myself back from doing a lot of things I wanted to accomplish thanks to my dependance. I wanted to quit several times this year but simply couldn’t garner enough willpower to go cold turkey; we’re currently in August and I cant believe how fast the year went by already. It probably went that fast bc I was high tbh… 

Neverthless, I’ve decided to focus on myself for the next 5 months and not look back. The first week was easy but surprisingly, tonight I got hit with my first real craving for the devils’ lettuce since having made the decision to quit a week ago. I’ve been experiencing insomnia, mood wings, tight throat, sluggish/lethargic days but the fact that I was able to get through a whole week sober while finally being able to dream again (let alone experience lucid ones), I literally have been losing weight bc I can finally tune into my intuitive eating rather than down whatever and however much is in front of me simply because I’m high. I find coming on here helps to restore my motivation and willpower to strive for what’s in my best interest not just in the present tense but this sub rlly just helps give me that push i need even if I feel like I can’t go on any longer and my addiction is still calling me somehow.

Please keep fighting it, you didn’t get this far to only get THIS FAR. Don’t stop and never look back. You do not need it, you never have. You were born and came into this world without it, you’ve never needed it to survive and you never will. All you need is yourself. Put yourself first and take care of your self. You only have ONE body, love it, appreciate it and learn to romanticize and love your life without the need to manipulate your brain chemistry first.",8,0

I smoked 5-6 years straight but now I am 100% dedicated to quit and I will do so. My biggest problem is eating. For me, the cravings arent that bad and since after day 2, even sleeping isnt a problem anymore.
Since I do a lot of strengthtraining, I originally started to smoke weed, so that I can manage to eat up to 4000cal.
 Now its day 7 for me and it only gets worse. I tried to force myself but I will only throw up. Only thing I can eat/drink is milk but also only to an extent. 
Already lost 10 pounds, while my original goal is to gain weight.. and I feel sick 24/7.  
Whats your experience about appetite and nausea? When was it normal again for you? It would really encourage me to keep going because every time I look in the mirror I lost some weight...

Positvi aspects: 
1. I feel so better about myself and so confident about my abilities in other areas of my life because honestly I didnt think I could reach this point. 
2. I’m much more focused (relatively) and still have a long long long way to go.
3. I’m able to sleep better.
4. I realize how much time I have been wasting or just cruising through without doing anything that’s gonna make my life better. 
5. I came to realize so many other patterns in my day-to-day life which are not beneficial for my well-being.

Negative aspects: 
1. I wake up everyday with a fuck-all headache and grogginess. 
2. I feel sad and just unmotivated few days not being able to out of the bed and get working. 
3. I’m irritated and a little on the edge always but that’s getting better and better every day. 
4. Headaches are so sporadic and never ending.
5. Withdrawal symptoms are like very intense especially psychological one when compared to physiological ones. 


All in all, it was the best decision I ever took. There is soooo much potential in me that I could tap and make use of to change myself for the betterment of this world. This quote always hits me up hard and I think it’s very relevant to my present state-of-mind.

I’m on day 2 now, going on 15 years now of smoking. Taken a few breaks here and there, with my longest being 6 months. Currently aiming for 1 month sober again, and will see where I’m at then. More than likely I will continue this sober streak, but mentally I can’t tell myself it’s forever yet (addict brain).

I’m on day 2 once again and I’ve got to say quitting isn’t as bad as I remember (so far). That may be because I phased out of dabs several months ago, and quit smoking in the morning the past month too. 

I feel like a new high almost. The lack of being high is like a high to me because I’m so not used to feeling it. Work is going better already and I already know from the other times my sex life will improve too. 

I’m quitting all other drugs and supplements this time, unlike the others. 

I just want clarity again. I want me again. I don’t want to feel lost in my head and not present anymore. I don’t want to devote hours and thousands of dollars to a ephemeral feeling that isn’t even that great.

If you saw me in person you would say, whoa, that guy is muscular, strong and super healthy looking. However on the inside I feel like I am super weak. I ask myself what’s the point of being physically healthy and strong if my mental state is weak?

I am a decently looking guy and women seem to find me attractive but I go on dates and usually women lose interest and my only guess is they can sense my lack of confidence… my belief is that going through mental stress makes you emotionally stronger and when you use weed to mask the stress you miss out on that. 

Here I am today and I am built like a brick shit-house but on the inside I feel like a house of cards, super weak.. 

Inner strength is an important part of being a man, actually far more important than physical strength. Smoking weed to mask problems is super weak and not something a strong man does.

I had a really hard week last week, work stress, withdrawal stress, the person whom I was in my most meaningful relationship with (which ended in large part because of my lack of presence) just got engaged and I’ve been inundated with pictures of their engagement and thoughts of “damn, what if..”

It doesn't really work that way, and you are likely to end up with completely different issues if you abuse weed. Insomnia, for example.

Anyway, just recently I've started working towards my goals. I've lost 13 kgs and I've found I like exercising in the process. I've also started studying for a quite hard exam that will hopefully grant me access to a civil servant position and that will definitely improve my life.

Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I quit smoking 90 days ago. Spent the last 12 years desperately trying to quit my daily habit, never making it past a few days. If I had a dollar for every time I told myself I was going to quit and failed a day later, I would have enough to buy a ps5 from a scalper. 

Not entirely sure why but 96 days ago, I just stopped and it was effortless. Maybe because I spent the past year working out, meditating, doing cognitive behavioral therapy exercises, reading, and learning about dating, something I was always afraid of and felt I wasn't worthy of doing. I worked on aspects about myself that I had put off and changed my idea of myself. I felt more and more confident and fulfilled. I think I reached a point where my desire to smoke just stopped because the pain of insecurity and hopelessness subsided to a manageable level. 

I'm now steadily dating someone and in a great place. I tell people that for the past 9 years, I've been climbing up an escalator that was going downhill. 90 days ago, the escalator stopped. 

That being said, the urges have come back. I'm not sure why. I think it's because my weed usage used to be tied to my (forgive the TMI) masturbation habits. And lately I've been looking at pornography more and it's making me want to smoke. Or maybe it's that I feel good/safe and think I can toke up without it being harmful. or maybe my insecurity/feelings of hopelessness are increasing because of something I can't seem to identify.

I guess this is going to be a constant work in progress. It'll get easier as time goes on but I still need to stay vigilant. I'm lucky to be where I am. Grateful to have made it this far. I'm not going to give up. Thanks for reading.

Apologies for the long post but I need to vent. I decided to quit getting stoned last week, primarily to regain a higher energy level and sense of ambition, and today is my sixth day in. I had been smoking for over a decade and smoking daily (except for a few short ""tolerance breaks"") for about 7 years. The amount I would smoke varied greatly over those 7 years - sometimes I was taking dabs all throughout the day, sometimes I was smoking a tiny bit at night to fall asleep.

A big part of why I decided to quit is that I am at a crossroads in my life. After working at a major tech company for a few years, I realized that I was miserable and never wanted to work in software, so I quit my job a few months ago after much consideration. I am now trying to forge my own career path in an area that will give me a sense of pride and fulfillment, and it quickly became clear that weed was getting in the way.

I have known for a while that weed has damaged my brain's reward system. It has become very hard for me to motivate myself to do something based on long term reward. It just feels like I am forcing myself to do things and my brain never really understands the point or feels a sense of accomplishment. I can sit around and think about what I want to do with my life, but when I take action I am constantly losing focus and running into brain fog. I hope this will get better once I have been off weed for longer, but I feel like I need to do something now to actively counteract this lack of dedication and enthusiasm for my own future.

I am wondering if anyone else has also felt this way and/or has any tips for getting my brain's reward system back into the habit of doing things for on long term reward and responsibility. I know exercise and diet are big ones, and I have been working on improving those since a few weeks before I quit weed.

Hey, everybody. I posted something a bit ago but it seems like it didn’t post. New here, so not sure if I did anything wrong.

I began smoking weed about 18 months ago. I’d probably smoke three days a week and when I did it was a lot. And it would almost always be by myself.

After a period of time I noticed I had issues getting it up with my wife which is completely not like me because I am extremely attracted to her and I’ve never had any issues before. Usually I’d be ready to go almost instantly. This scared the hell out of me.

I kind of laid off smoking for a bit, but maybe once a month for the past few months I’ll take one hit. Now I’m thinking that the smoking and my problem may be connected, and the more I read, I’m maybe seeing correlation with sex/fapping while high, which I did most times.

I’m just really scared, frustrated, embarrassed, demasculated, etc. and every time I try to talk to someone about it, they think there’s no way it can be related to the weed. But I don’t know, I guess I’m just looking for some guidance, any tips, or anything, because I’m pretty depressed about the whole thing right now. I just want to have a normal intimate relationship with my wife again.

Thanks, everyone.",11,0

Please tell me your post-marijiuana anger stories to make me feel less out of control.,"My boyfriend unintentionally hurt my feelings really badly  a couple weeks ago and i told him about it, he didn't really apologize but it's nuanced if he should have and his behavior has 100% been trying to make up for it, and so I thought I'd let it go. 

Now I've stopped smoking weed 4 days ago and I Just Hate Him Now. I feel so angry and he made me upset again a couple days ago. It was a little thing this time that usually would not have bothered me much but without weed I felt furious and lashed out via text and also cancelled plans we'd had this week. 

We've since made up via text but I've spent most of the last 2+ weeks upset with him and avoiding spending as much time with him as possible. 

I don't want to fight anymore. He's great and i love him a lot but right now i feel so mad at him and hate him - i started feeling so angry during the initial fight weeks ago but weed helped me control myself...but im still hurt by it i guess...

I don't want to keep being mean to him so feel like i just want him to stay away from me til this rage subsides... 

But this weekend i have to fly to a different state for a wedding with his whole family.

I'm scared of how I'll be able to deal with a trip with his family without weed after basically mostly avoiding him and being upset with him for 2+ weeks now. 

I can't believe how angry I'm on and off feeling the past days. I'm not used to feeling so angry. Depressed, sure. But not angry like this. I want to attack everyone. 

Has anyone else dealt with similar stuff and can recount their experiences? I sort of would prefer comradery here instead of advice. I know i could be like meditating or exercising so don't need someone to tell me to call a friend or whatever. Just... I dunno.

I am a serious munchie stoner. Every night, I'd grab all of the snacks I could find and gorge. My boyfriend and I used to go to this Mexican restaurant down the street semi-frequently and I'd get my favorite \[massive\] burrito (plus some sides). We went there a couple of days ago for the first time since I got sober, and I couldn't even finish my burrito. When high, I'd down that, the sides, and snack like an hour later. I've dropped ten pounds in three weeks and haven't ""felt"" like I'm dieting or anything- I'm just not smoking anymore. 

I also feel less winded climbing steep hills/walking long distances. Hiking is so much easier. Can't imagine how inhaling smoke every night might have been hurting my lungs. Despite the shitty withdrawal, my body is happier for this choice. Much needed reminder given the nightly nightmares have still not subsided. :/

This is day 1 of attempt #20 something.","Hello all, newly joined this sub and I've been lurking since, I've found quite a few stories similar to mine so here I am seeking support! 

I am 27 y.o., recently became a father (baby has 6 months and a half!), my partner of 6 years now and I have a small business, currently opening a second location, we work from home most of the time so we get to spend lots of time with our son. He's really happy, and sure this is a self evaluation but we're doing a great job raising him and caring for him. 

I'm going to keep the next bit brief: we're renting a nice place with backyard and pool, currently in the process of building our dream home, we're not rich by any means, but we're definitely stable financially, have health insurance, and can afford to go on holiday once a year. We're living the average middle class life without putting in the average middle class hours of hard work, so I consider us better off than most people simply because our stress levels are way lower than regular households. I am definitely a functioning addict, although I wouldn't say high functioning. 

I've been smoking almost daily since I was 16 years old (it started as once a week thing, but within 2 weeks of my first joint I was smoking daily). Then I started smoking cigarettes too around 18 years old. Now I've been quitting smoking weed and nicotine off and on for the past 4 years. The longest I went without weed was 2 months, and the longest without tobacco was almost 2 years (23 months). I often relapse because something doesn't suit me in my life anymore and instead of dealing with it head on I tend to let things drag and let them run their course... Which means I sit and smoke and start overthinking stuff until Im high enough that the thought can't clearly form itself in my mind. 

Today is yet another shot at quitting. I'm not going to fool myself and say ""this time is the right time"" because I've said so more times than I can count. Weed isn't the problem, the relationship I have with it is. And no matter how much the addict voice tells me ""you can start smoking socially again, it won't take over this time"" I know that one drag off of one joint means relapse for me. I ran out 2 days ago, asked some of my stoner friends for a bit of weed, smoked it and now ran out again last night.

Accidental day 1, but this sub gave me hope and I thought why not try again. I've read some of your posts on here and I found many similar withdrawal symptoms as mine, although I think there's one I haven't seen yet: diarrhea. Yup, not even joking, but every time I quit my digestive track becomes a mess, I'm constipated while having diarrhea. Usually lasts 24h from the beginning then it goes away. So yay for this ongoing shitty day ! Pun intended. 

Hoping that this share will help me quit, after all this is the first time I virtually admit to wanting to quit. Best of luck to all of you lurkers",33,0

Even something as little as going to the grocery store ends in me having to leave faster then anticipated because if I stand too long I start feeling light in the head, queezy in the stomach and plain ready to black out. I never do, I'm absolutely not prone to fainting so I'm lucky there.

I still feel a little cloudy in my mind and was pretty depressed and hopeless this morning, but played some guitar and im feeling in good spirits now. Only major thing now is i cant seem to eat at ALL. Ive managed to force myself to eat a decent amount of food the previous days even with low appetite but today i just COULDNT. Thinking about food and the feeling of it im my mouth and stomach has been making my skin crawl and the few bites ive taken of a sandwich nearly came back up. That made me feel a bit faint so ive been drinking lots of fruit juices as for some reason they sit well. I really hope things keep getting better like this and tomorrow im not just back to feeling grim - ive gotta vacation to enjoy!! 


Also another interesting thing - I never intended this to be a permanent or long term quit and if im honest had 100% intentions to go back to daily smoking as soon as i got back off vacation, but now i really REALLY dont wanna do that. Not fully decided the path im gonna take but i know i NEVER want to be physically dependant on weed again.

I may have smoked a gram during that time (hit here or there from a friend), so not completely sober but still. Then I went on pretty much a binge (completely unintentional) for nearly 2 months, before getting this far into being sober again.

My mood is getting more stable and I'm less irritable, I actually feel really good randomly just by thinking of something funny or whatever, and laugh to myself.

No hard desires to smoke. Thought comes thought goes, I'm not invested in it anymore, like I'm not *really* considering it. \*PUFF\* it's gone, I don't stay thinking about it for long.

I was sober in a hangover on Saturday, which I consider an accomplishment. It may seem minor, but I used to always want weed for hangovers, because I hate them lol. Maybe I ought to not drink as well. It's fun, but it can trigger cravings, because of the bad feelings afterwards.

Becoming less stressed and more confident by the day. I feel honestly that I don't think weed can offer me a lot at this point.

The whole relapse during June and July I constantly felt like, ***is this it?*** *What am I trying to get out of this?* I just ended up with poorer wellbeing and started to need weed to feel normal. It's ridiculous how deceiving weed (my addiction) can be. Just because I didn't have a great reason not to smoke (at the moment at least, because things were fine for the most part), I didn't have to smoke either, but I did it anyway. I said to myself ""well, just this time. Once more. I'll stop after the weekend"" and bunch of other half-lies.

I feel a lot more at ease now. I can cook food, I go for runs, I sleep and rest better, I'm not groggy like I was in the mornings. Yeah I have some brainfog, but man... Just the amount of time that I have that is not revolving around weed has freed space in my life. I have no guilt or shame, I have nothing to hide from the people I know, I can take walks without taking weed with me. I don't feel disappointed in myself; well, sure I sometimes do but you know what I mean. Weed was a major source of negativity for me, because I felt like I was letting myself down all the time.

I've been a very heavy smoker, one of the heaviest you can know probably. I'd smoke from 0,3g to 1g a joint minimum. Not only 1 or 2 times a day, but more than 10 times a day each day for the last 4 or 5 years. I feel pathetic even admitting this because until I was 18 I hated smoking or the idea of it, I completely despised smoking and was the last one of my friends to give in to it.

How I've been feeling these last days :
- Groggy as hell
- Low energy with random bursts of anger/irritation giving me some energy but feeling even more drained afterwards
- Head pressure
- Gray/Black patches under the eye sockets, it's really bad it looks like I haven't slept in 1 year
- I feel hungry and I'm very thin but I'm not sure if I'm having some episode of psicosis because I have a very difficult time eating  solid foods, has anyone had like 'forgotten' how to eat and swallowing food? It happened more than 100 times these last days where I feel like the food gets stuck for some seconds when I'm swallowing it, my mind starts to imagine the worst case scenario and my heart starts beating like it wants to pop off my chest

Because of this eating problem I now feel very very weak generally whereas I had more energy the days after I quit smoking. I'm gonna quit for good never in my life I want to go through this crap again honestly it's terrifying. 

I've been eating fruits, garlic, honey and salads so I can pump my body with vitamins but I'm afraid that if I keep this eating routine the worst will happen.

If anyone has gone through anything similar your input and advices are very very appreciated, thank you

edit: 0,3g to 1g in my joints was just weed, I'd pump half a cigarette for every joint I smoke so I'd smoke around 10 cigs non directly every day which makes me think I have withdrawal symptoms from both weed and cigar.",2,0

 It was hard but more than possible. It started 2 month ago and now I can see the difference. Some times thoughts about do some hits come to my mind but its easy to manage them now. First month was challenging, and then it became easier and easier. Now i don't waist my life in such stupid way, together with weed computer games and hours of high watching cartoons and Netflix leave my life. Memory and emotional areas improves and i feel more resilient to stress and do sports regularly. In my opinion it was the best decision in my life to quit after 5 years of regular smoking.

Long time lurker and long time smoker here (M28) who has been smoking since he was 14. Although I have had periods of sobriety since then (longest was 6 months), I have been pretty full-on since then.

Things came to a head recently after I realised how much money and time I have been wasting on this stuff. I tried to quit around 6 months ago to no avail. The turning point was when I logged into my habit tracking app and seen that if I had stuck to my plan, I would have saved nearly 3500+ EUR.

I’m only on day 8 and I know that at any point this could all go up in smoke (pun completely intended) if I get lax. To help me through this, I wanted to share some observations;

1. I was surprised that the physical withdrawals have been mild for me this time. My physical withdrawals were pretty rough in my previous attempts to quit (night sweats and night terrors were common).
2. **Changing my environment** has been a massive help. I decided to head back to the UK knowing I would have to do a 10-day quarantine at my parents' house. Knowing I was unable to leave the house to get my hands on some has been a deterrent.
3. **Being open about your struggles** with the people closest to you made me feel less alone in the fight. Having a good support network is crucial. I am lucky to have friends and family who support me.
4. Switching from high THC weed to lower THC hash (Moroccan) in the lead-up to my quit date may have lessened the intensity of withdrawals. I don’t know if this is to be true, but every time I have quit in the past I went cold turkey and it WRECKED my body.
5. **Eating healthy**, **drinking lots of water**, and **not having screen time** before bed has been hugely beneficial.
6. **Intense exercise**. The kind of exercise that makes you want to quit. I have been doing HIT exercises/weights in the house during my quarantine. Apparently, intense exercise can release dopamine (I need to get it from somewhere now!)
7. **Exercising my brain.** Getting back into learning a language makes me feel like I am not wasting my time and my brain is getting a workout in the meantime.
8. **Use a tracking App** \- has been a great way of tracking my progress. I was surprised to see how much money I have saved and how many grams of hash I’ve avoided pumping into my lungs.

I am waiting for all of the withdrawals to hit me now. I am waiting for the night sweats and night terrors to return. I am waiting for the brain fog. I am waiting for all of this to become too much. It might come, it might not come. Who knows?

The only thing I do know is that this time, I feel more prepared than ever. I know the hard work will start when I head back to the country I live in where I was smoking like crazy.

Sorry for the ramble, I had to get this out of my system. Thanks for reading.",4,2

Battle depression, love the highs that make me happy and extroverted, then cycle through it not working, me overusing, and just spiraling down until I hate smoking and being high so much I quit for months/years

Well, I decided I actually HATE this cycle even though it feels magical at first. So on Saturday, I quit dabs (which I think I may have developed a VERY strong opinion against) and went camping to fast and exercise away the worst of detox. 

Well life carries on even though the weekend ends and I had to be home Sunday evening to start my week on Monday. I woke up at 3:30am with so much anxious adrenaline. Started fighting with my bf when his 4am alarm went off about his drug friends, the sad life we have, everything. 

It escalated to me running out of the house and driving my car down the street, going to run away forever. But I couldn't see without my glasses, so I turned around, threw my car keys in the parking lot screaming about how I wish someone would take the awful POS car. When I got back in he's crying and I'm just... Angry. Idk. I don't know what i screamed about. I broke the ceiling fan. I jumped and ran around.m screaming. 

Now it's 2 hours later. He left. I have a broken fan and need to go get my car keys and park properly. 

WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THIS INCIDENT?! IS THIS DAB DETOX?! Or did I catch some feral fever at the campground? 

If it IS dab detox, will this happen again? This weird adrenaline rush of irrational emotions. I am not sure how to handle/anticipate ... Whatever the hell just happened. Props to bf for not calling the cops and just leaving. I probably would have been shot after attacking them or something. Idk. That was an insane episode I'm just processing. 

Can someone tell me what to do? How this happened? How I can prevent it while I detox?

 I will put myself in a mental hospital (or call police on myself/ give permission for bf to call) if that happens again but it is an absolute last case scenario",2,0

So I need to quit. Like, really need to quit. I believe that it is possible for some people to be regular smokers and not have an issue with it, that's not me though. I've got over 20k credit card debt that went pretty much on weed over the course of about 5 years. For years I smoked about a 20 bag a week and I was cool with that, then got into buying weight as it was better value. My first oz lasted 6 weeks, then 5, then 4, at my peak I could smoke a Q a day. I've gone through an oz in 4 days. If someone I didn't know told me they'd gone through that much I'd think they were full of shit. Yet here I am.

I don't even enjoy being high anymore, it just makes me feel worse, and yet I habitually get high.

I managed 6 weeks earlier in the year, stayed with family in another part of the country. I bought weed as soon as I got back and I've been chonging it ever since.

The mental gymnastics us addicts are capable of genuinely blow my mind. I know that this is the one thing that I need to do, that my attention span will improve, that I'll be able to enjoy my life and that I won't feel like such a piece of shit for needing this goddamn plant. I bet every person in here knows that '1 more bag' promise to yourself. I've been promising myself for years now, time to take some fucken action.

So I have been seeing a girl who works at a strip club and I go see her while she works quite a bit and sometimes take her out for breakfast after. Saw her Friday night and we ended up getting breakfast and that was great, she said she was working again Saturday night so of course I saw her again last night.

At one point she was sitting on my lap and one of her friends came over and said someone had something for her, so she assured me she would be right back and left. When she came back she said she had something to show me and pulled a joint out of her purse and waved it under my nose before I could react. She knows that I don't smoke and that I used to but she doesn't really have the greatest understanding of my situation so she didn't really know what that small action would do to me. Shortly after that she had to go to the stage, and while she was up there we both made it clear that I wasn't the typical customer, they have a three stage setup there and the girls go from one stage down to the next, she took my hat on the first stage and didn't return it till the third. 

She had a few guys ask her for dances so when she got off the stage she went to take care of that. I am not a jealous person but one of the guys got her for an hour and a half and at that point I was extremely tired as I only had about an hour and a half of sleep and had been doing things all day, I just wanted to spend a little more time with her before I left and I was honestly a little jealous after waiting that long. She was worth the wait though, we went to a private area and just cuddled and talked for a while. This is where it went a little down hill, she said she really likes me but she isn't sure if she is ready for a relationship yet. She just got out of a rough one and she doesn't want that to happen again. I completely understand that as I haven't dated in three years for similar reasons. So basically she said she definitely wants to keep seeing me and she want to see where this goes but we have to take it slow. Which all that's fine by me, I probably shouldn't rush into my first relationship in three years anyways but it kinda got me down.

So we were supposed to meet up today to just hang out some, depending on the time she woke up it was either going to be an amusement park or we were going to go to a bar. I know she stayed up a lot later than me and I went to bed at 6 in the morning so I know it's entirely possible she is still asleep but after our talk last night I feel really nervous about not hearing from her.

The whole being nervous about her thing coupled with the whif of a joint I got last night have been giving cravings all day, worse than I have had them since I first quit. I don't really have any good ways to get any weed right now so I'm not too worried but it's just piling up on me. It's made me feel more like shit all day which is just making me want it more. I need to get out of my head right now but I just can't seem to.

I've been trying to quit weed for over a year now. The longest I went clean was 2 months, during which time I actively improved my life and got better. Long story short, I got complacent, stopped doing my routines and things that prevented me from relapsing and here I am. I relapsed and am still smoking, now more than ever.

I'm so done. Every time I relapse, I lose hope that I can make it but I don't have a choice anymore. I'm out of money and can't keep up with the illusion of functionality. My partner and family think I'm still clean. I just want to quit and never have to tell them how bad things are right now and just go back to being sober. I don't know how I'm going to make it through withdrawal without my wonderful partner finding out. Do I tell her? I just don't know anymore.

If you're thinking about relapsing, please don't. Seriously. The addiction will tell you that you can have just one more joint, but addiction is a liar. There's no such thing as one last joint for us; that's why we're here. Play the tape forward, don't make the same mistake I did. Sure, smoking up might feel really good for a night or a couple of months. But eventually, you will end up right back in the pit.

I already have some problems with anxiety and somewhat with depression and smoking would make them so much worse. However, for the first like 30 minutes after smoking i didn’t have any of those problems and my life would seem perfect to me and i was only happy. After that i’d get sad and anxious but i would always smoke to get that first 30 minute feeling back. 

For the whole time i’ve been sober i haven’t really felt the desire to smoke again because i knew that it made no sense to and would do more harm than good. I still know this and know that if i do again it could cause many problems for me and especially with my schoolwork which i don’t want to mess up. Logically i know that there is no reason i should go back to smoking, however there’s a nagging voice these last couple weeks that i should just try it again and keep it to just weekends of casual use. 

However i know that won’t happen if i do but i just can’t seem to shake this feeling. Maybe it’s because i’m stressed but i’ve been more stressed in the past and never felt the desire to start again. Do i just have to try and stay strong and hope it will pass? Almost all my friends smoke but honestly whenever i would be around them or hear them talk about stories from when they were high it would honestly motivate me to stay sober, so i’m not sure what changed.

I’ve been a lot happier recently but I realize this is a place I can talk without fear of feeling judged. So some background: I’m 16, I quit weed in November after smoking daily for about 4 months. Since then I’ve struggled with meeting myself again, and I’ve been living in this state of existential questioning and daziness. From November until now I’ve smoked on a few occasions because at times my life has felt unbearable. I realized a few weeks ago that all the lack of emotions and anxiety and disconnection I felt was not natural and I think it may have even been psychosis, either that or just extreme depersonalization. But one things for sure, this has been the greatest cripple I have ever experienced. Even now a lot of the time I find myself struggling to do things that most people do by second nature. For example eye contact, making conversation, and even the concept of humanity and body parts have freaked me out. I know that sounds weird haha but that’s how I feel. It’s clear to me that I was unable to make the most of a year of my life and that makes me sad. I’m wondering if any of you guys have felt similar or have some advice for me. Don’t get me wrong, everything I just talked about is improving everyday but even so, time is precious and I’ve already used up so much of it on something I shouldn’t be experiencing. Thanks guys this sub has helped me so much.",4,0

So, I've made it a whole month. Wanted to share my experience with that and ask some questions. I've smoked for 15 years pretty much every day. Things escalated when I found a girlfriend who was a pretty heavy user. A great gal really. It was just so easy for us to smoke all day while both being on furlough (She works in a lab and I in the film industry - which was pretty much dead for a long time during the harshest lockdowns) We smoked so much. And we got some insane weed from our dealers.

So, one month. Pretty much all aspects of my life has improved. I can still get bored but I dont really mind at this point. It's strange going from playing videogames, watching Familyguy and having sex all day to doing none of them. I can sit in silence and look at clouds go by and listen to the trees rustle in the wind and feel good about it (After about three weeks) During my second week I had two days of extreme depression but that passed, luckily.

I excersise, I enjoy sitting in the sun. I eat much more and much healthier. Sometimes I just crave a good chicken salad. I drink much more water and recently I have less negative thoughts and processes. Mostly due to just being aware of them. My looks have vastly improved as my skin has color, glow and my eyes dont look dead anymore.

There's only one thing that still bothers me. I still can't seem to get decent sleep. I sleep for a few hours and wake up. Sometimes drenched in sweat. The first time I quit I had vivid dreams after a week, but this time I just recently started having them. I'm getting pretty tired of it.

I'm wonder if anyone feels the same? Is it because I've been smoking top-notch weed in huge amounts for pretty much two years? When Can I expect to get some proper sleep? I keep reading 1-2 weeks up to one month but It's pretty much been the same since day 1. Have I just been an extreme abuser? Happy to hear from anyone.

Anyway, if you're on the fence or some days in, or a week - keep it up! I can promise you it does get better. Allow your body and mind to heal and re-adjust! There's no going back for me. I feel more ambitious than ever, I have more long term goals and will never give it up!

Peace and love to you all!",9,1

I've been actively trying to curtail my use for two years and while I've definitely grown and gotten more responsible in smoking less, being critical about my use, growing my self discipline, I haven't achieved more than 7 days completely sober from weed in that time. 

I tried going to a counselor for AODA a few months ago, but I didn't like the guy at all. I didn't feel like he listened to me and his treatment plan felt very prescriptive instead of collaborative. Our first session he suggested I stop trying to use a k-safe to moderate my use and simply use how i want to and be observant about my behaviors, feelings etc. I have been quite insightful about my use, my triggers, and honestly felt like I had done that work already, and was coming to him very confident about the nature of my use. I did the practice anyways (if the mental health professional tells me I can light up whenever I want, I WILL take advantage of that), and came to him for our second session feeling the same amount of confident that my natural usage feels unhealthy and something I want to address. He told me I should consider 12 step, and then explained to me the very basics of the program. 

I felt very frustrated that he didn't ascertain my background knowledge about 12 step (i have researched it a few times more extensively). He presented it as the only way forward, and admitted he didn't know any cannabis-specific programs. That rubbed me the wrong way because he also told me on our first session that he sees a lot of folks he works with struggling with cannabis addiction...and yet he hasn't googled Marijuana Anonymous before?? He never once really asked me about my sobriety goals or my own recovery attempts or even my personal experiences in addiction. 

It was helpful to see him because I did attend a few MA calls, and I think every attempt I make toward sobriety is useful in some way, but after that second session and having built no relation with this counselor, i couldnt see myself going back. I also didnt feel very compelled or connected to MA. 

Now tomorrow is attempt #2 with a different counselor, and I'm scared that it will be a similar experience. Maybe I'm not ready to be working on my abstinence goals with a therapist, maybe I'm being too critical and dismissive of my therapist's first suggestions. 

I feel very alone and out of control in my usage right now and I really want to work with someone who will meet me where I'm at and help me feel respected for the work I've done so far.

I just turned 20 yesterday and figured enough is enough. I might get 6 more years of brain development, so my hope is that by quitting I'll even out the playing field. I wonder all the time how my life might have been different if I never lit up. Maybe I'd have more motivation, maybe it would be easier to get up in the morning, maybe I'd be doing cooler things. But there's no point in dwelling anymore and thinking about what could've been. It's time to see what I can do now. I've successfully taken breaks two times before. The first time was 3 years ago and I quit for 6 months. All of my anxiety and weird early teen emotions came back full swing and hit me in the face. I couldn't sleep and in the morning I'd feel horribly sick. Had bad IBS and eventually just started drinking. But after a few months I couldn't stop telling my friends how much better I felt overall. The second time I quit was about a year ago, and I managed without the stuff for 4 months. And I didn't have all the negative symptoms, and again I felt great, and told my gf how great I felt and how glad I was that I stopped smoking, but eventually lit up again. 

I want to stop again, but this time feels harder than all the others. When I imagine a night without smoking I immediately start to panic, and it feels like going to bed without any supper. Or feels like that realization that you have an unfinished paper due at midnight. It's like there's a little light at the end of my night that is smoking weed, and knowing I will use it later motivates my entire day. Which is pretty pathetic. I know that if I quit I can literally smoke whenever I want. I know the next day I could smoke if I had to, but it still feels like I have to do it everyday. 

I also probably have an addiction to the internet, and if you know how it is watching YouTube late into the night, watching far past bedtime, weed is internet addictions best friend. I set out to find a video that will make me laugh really hard. I freakin love to laugh hard, and I use weed as an agent to get me there. Only I know that the times that I laughed the hardest were the times I was sober. I just haven't done it in a long time. 

I'm afraid of PAWS making me even lazier than I am now. And the brain fog that comes in the first few weeks, and the insomnia, and the appetite issues. (although the last time I quit I gained like 20 pounds, but ""good"" pounds"". I just find it silly that I'm so afraid of taking a break from a plant. I should re read that story about the toad and the frog and the cookie jar. But anyways, maybe tonight will be the night that I find the courage to quit. Because after all, taking the first step is always the hardest part, and you often realize it's not so bad once you begin.

I sometimes drink alcohol, and I have never felt compelled to use it in a problematic way. Yet I don't disbelieve alcoholics when they say they have a problem. I wish people gave our community that same level of respect and credence.

Similarly, I was talking to my therapist the other day about my experience with marihuana withdrawals.

I know what I'm experiencing. And as we all know, there is support for the existence of such withdrawals. I later confronted him with the evidence and he apologised.

I honestly feel like weed is my Achilles heel. Like lock and key, it is the specific type of feeling that I crave and also that causes me to become someone I don't recognize.
