I'm keen as hell on quitting dabs/bud. I've managed to get myself a week or two clean here and there, bit always fall back into the habit.

Last time I quit, I felt I had great motivation and my willpower was winning; but smelling weed on my partner or smelling it when I walk outside was just too damn tempting; like every other time, I caved in and got high, which immediately fell into daily use again.

My partner doesn't want to quit, and I have to respect her decision. We have children together, so leaving or having a break is not possible.

Does anyone have any tips on how to navigate this situation? 
Quitting is really important to me this year, I'll be studying at university for the first time in my life (I'm in my 30's) and I don't want a cloudy head for it.",7

I go back and forth almost daily about quitting and wonder if maybe I’m just scared to deal with life sober again.  The idea of getting clean and finding myself healthier, more productive and active in life and maybe even on my way to a career sounds great but I’m struggling to hold on to those goals as I worry about my mental health declining. I’d love any tips or suggestions, maybe even just personal experiences getting to your quitting point and making it through Day 1. Thanks <3",2

Today was really, really difficult. After a week of obsessive Ukraine watching and a weekend of depressive binge eating on my part, my partner and I had a conversation about an unrelated topic that could possibly end in us calling it quits.

Twice today, I made the decision that I was absolutely going to drive to the dispensary and buy a single joint to relieve some of the stress, but I didn't follow through either time. I sat, I bawled my eyes out, ordered Starbucks delivery, had multiple follow up conversations with him, and I STAYED SOBER.

Day \~21 was really bad, but today was worse. I'm still craving, but I'm feeling really fucking proud of myself right now. THIS is the ""feeling your feelings"" I quit for in the first place.

In December of 2021, my depression reached it absolute worst point, where I wasn’t eating, not moving not ever cleaning up myself or the space I lived in. 
I reached out for help and landed at a mental health facility, where I confessed after a few sessions I smoked. The week after, my therapist told me what the condition of the treatment was going to be. 
I had to quit. I was sitting with a shocked Pikachu face. 
I thought my therapist was telling me ‘You’re quitting the weed now or we’ll stop helping you.’ I told her this, and she quickly said that if I couldn’t quit on my own, they would connect me to an addiction facility where I would get the same kind of therapy I was getting now. 
I was really pissed off for the rest of the day. Smoking a joint had become my little self care routine, something to relieve my mind from my miserableness throughout the day. In reality, smoking weed gave me crazy anxiety, extreme drowsiness in the morning and took away my motivation.
On february 11th, I smoked my last joint with some buddies. It was a really nice fun moment. 
I’ve now abstained from weed for two weeks and I can honestly say I feel so much better without it. I get out of bed relatively easier, I feel healthier and more energized to be productive and take care of myself. 
I’ve had a few moments where I was exhausted from things, like visiting my parents, and just wanted to sedate my thoughts. But I didn’t give in! 
I also joined this sub the day after that therapy session, and it’s helped me immensely to hear all of your stories. Thank you for sharing them. 
If you want to quit and have no idea how to survive without, I hope you can believe me when I say; you got this. Its gonna be tough as hell, but you’re tougher. 

Take care of yourself. Cook, bake, crochet, buy some fancy shower gel or a bath bomb, go to the gym, call a friend, take a hike.

You keeping those devices is stopping you from achieving what you want. As long as they are in your possession, you will have a way to relapse and most likely will if presented with the opportunity.

Any long time quitters can relate?,"A bit of backstory I used to post here a lot. However I had to make a new account and since getting past the few month mark I stopped checking in here. This sub helped me a lot in the beginning. I quit smoking in April of 2020, so I'm coming up on 2 years of no weed. Recently, the past week or so this thing has happened to me where I have an INSANE desire to smoke, dreaming about it. I live in a new city and don't know anyone and my state is illegal, if I'm being honest the only reason I haven't relapsed is I don't know where to buy any. I don't know what's going on with me, I have been reminiscing so much on the years of smoking especially the early days we all remember when weed was innocent and magical. I keep watching videos of people smoking and even looking at pictures of weed plants on IG. This is new because up until now after the first month or two of quitting the cravings went away besides a fleeting thought here and there. They've come back for some reason man I don't know. My theory is that since I got a new job I live near college students that live off campus, and man I keep smelling it, seeing kids piled in the car smoking, the other day I got gas late at night saw 4 guys smoking in their car. I think being around weed so much is causing me to reminisce, not only about weed but about fun times growing up, I guess we all miss those memories with friends some long gone. Hell the other day I caught a whiff leaving the gym and I stood next to my car just to smell it. IDK where I'm going with this but can anyone relate? Anyone who's quit for a long time? I genuinely believe my life is better without weed, weed took away my personality it made me a dull and boring person. Obviously I abused it smoked an eighth a day for almost 8 years. Sometimes I'd like to think I can control it now, but I am so conflicted. I know I don't need weed, I'm fine without it, it's just old memories and seeing all these college kids smoking is like looking into the past for me man and sometimes I wish I could turn back time to those days. I have a great job, hit the gym everyday, things are good, but I miss those days of not being so responsible. I could go on and on, sorry so long of a post don't know where to turn.

Have had stints of quitting though, like for almost all of 2020. But I’ve been back into it for the past year, and looking to stop again.

I work full time at a software sales job that pays very well. I have to interact with potential customers every day. I’m also in school finishing my degree so I’m very busy in general. 

Today, I have a ton of homework to do. It is due tonight. I’m having lots of trouble focusing and feel pretty crappy. I also have 3 very important calls early in the day tomorrow for work. Tomorrow will be when I’m going into day 3, the worst day.

I also have a week off from school at the end of March, and could easily take the week off of work.

My question is whether I should keep this going and fight through it and try to get my homework done by tonight and calls done tomorrow, or if I should wait till the end of March and take everything off for the week so this doesn’t potentially mess with my job or school. 

Any advice would be helpful. I really like the idea of taking everything off to do it.",1

This is not my first time quitting but it’s definitely the most motivated I’ve been. The toll that marijuana takes on my mental health is unreal and I just simply cannot function at a healthy level while using. I recently got a much better job and has a wake up call when I was sneaking carts through TSA and hitting them in the bathroom every hour on work trips. My nausea was unreal and even with smoking I could barely eat anything. The first week I was riddled with anxiety and couldn’t sleep or eat. But since then it has been pretty smooth sailing. I’ve taken up going to therapy and started filling my time with things that are good for me instead of just sitting in my room high passing the time and blocking out my problems. I’m done letting something have so much power over me. I’m in control of my life not some plant.

Edit: wow guys I really didn’t except this amount of support y’all are awesome. To everyone who might be reading this who is on the fence; if I can do it you can to. It doesn’t matter how many times you have to quit just keep quitting 😂",512

My story:
Been addicted to alcohol for 15 years and weed for 10. 
Alcohol was a lot easier to give up because it changed everything about my life: my personality, my appearance, ruined relationships, etc. 
Weed is a little different because it’s my companion for doing things I love: walking/hiking, driving, watching movies, working out, etc.  
now I will say I am seeing the negatives lately: I can’t remember shit. I usually can’t even remember what I wore or ate the day before unless I really think about it. 
Also I suffer from severe anxiety, I have my whole life but it’s gotten worse the past few years. I have to pass a drug test but I also know this is how I want to live my life: completely sober of all things but man this is *rough*",3

It's still fresh, as I quit last monday. But I'm feeling confident about this, for a number of reasons.

First, I don't think I had ever NOT smoked after work. I've been a weed smoker my whole professional life. It's shocking to realize this was my first week without weed. There were a few breaks, like when I go on vacation in countries where weed is hard to come by, but I would always compensate with cigarettes and alcohol. Plus, on vacation you're not in your everyday environment, so it's not really the same.

I wasn't a daily smoker before around 25 (I'm 38), because I was broke, and weed wasn't so easy to find, but as far as I can remember, I hated when I didn't have anything to smoke, and everything mostly revolved about finding some. Wandering in shady neighborhoods, buying whatever from whoever, sitting close to people who had some in parties. Man, those sure were shitty days. Things have changed a lot since then. For one I have steady income. And while weed is still illegal here in France, it's so easy to find nowadays. As easy as a text message, and you don't even have to move from your couch, it comes to you.

It started to get a bit out of hand lately. I love weed, but these last 2 years, there were spliffs I wasn't really enjoying. Spliffs that were just about getting my dose. Getting by the day. Avoiding problems. Avoiding boredom. I started smoking earlier and earlier in the day, every day (never on work days though -- but I did start vaping at work last year). Smoking on every occasion I got. Smoking in secret while spending time with my 6 year old daughter. Usually in this case I just take a few tokes to get a little light-headed, but I scared myself real bad a few months ago when a spliff really fucked me up for a good 20 minutes while my daughter was watching TV inside. I got really scared because if anything happened to her at that moment, I would have been incapable of reacting like a responsible adult. That was a clear warning.

I've been seriously pondering quitting weed for about a year now, with serious ""what the fuck are you doing with your life"" moments, but I never had the will to act on it. On January I decided to stop smoking and switch to 100% vaping. It didn't work out, I went back to spliffs in a nasty way. I started really hating myself. I know I need to address my mental health issues, but I also know the first thing any professional will tell me is to quit weed first. So I'm doing that before seeking help. Besides, I'm pretty sure most of my problems stem from weed anyway.

Last Sunday evening I was smoking spliffs watching Jaws 2 then Scream 5. I finished my bag and decided that was it. On Monday morning, while cleaning the house (gotta keep busy), I found some more weed laying around (there's always weed somewhere if you're a regular smoker), and my old self would have been like ""ok, I'll smoke this THEN I quit"". But I didn't. I knew I'd end up buying more. So I threw it in the garbage. \*I threw pot away\*. At that moment I knew something was different.

This was my first ""daily life"" week without weed (or alcohol for that matter, but I hardly drink anyway).

I don't really know how I found the sudden motivation (probably a combination of all these factors), but man, I'm so glad that I did. It's going surprisingly well so far, because while I'm already feeling positive effects (clearer thoughts, thinking ahead, feeling less tired, etc.), I'm also \*welcoming\* negative effects (feeling cranky, sad, anxious), because it means I'm doing the work. I don't know how I'm pulling this off but I feel like a fucking buddhist monk. The perspective of long-term positive effects far outweigh the temporary negative effects, and I'm amazed I've managed to convince myself of that. Quitting weed is also part of a bigger plan, I started doing more exercise, taking control of my finances. I think subconsciously I'm preparing for the second half of my life. Sleep is OK-ish, but man am I sweating profusely. And I'm strangely always hungry.

Luckily I have a few outlets to keep busy, mainly making electronic music. I can't deny it's not the same without weed. I hope music won't be a collateral damage to quitting weed. It's the only thing I'm really worried about.

I know this post lacks structure, but I just needed to get it all out, in the hope of getting some support from the community. It will help for sure. Thank you for reading !",13

This time around, what I'm experiencing is alcohol being not nearly as enjoyable as it used to be. It almost just goes straight to headache, almost, or nausea, with very little fun buzz. I know a lot of people on this sub are committed to full sobriety and perhaps this is my body pushing me in that direction, but I am still really hesitant to give up alcohol forever like weed. 

I'm also wondering if it's just me adjusting to what stuff feels like when I am not numbing myself with weed all the time. Like, has alcohol sucked this whole time and I just couldn't tell? Or am I just getting old and unable to handle anything anymore? Anyone else experience this?",2

Im 34.  Ive taken breaks for days , weeks or months in the past but always knew id go back 

Weed has never really 'hindered' me from having a normal life. I'm married. Had a great job (recently decided to step away for mental health), great friends and hobbies etc. 

I constantly found myself using weed as a way to 'enjoy things more'. Video games. Playing or Watching sports,  movies or TV shows. Eating. I habitualized it and normalized it to the point where doing it any other way felt alien.

I quit smoking weed on 2/22/2022. Not a break. I don't smoke weed. That is the verbiage I use now.

On the 23rd i hung with friends. They smoked. I didn't. I had no craving.

This weekend I'm at a cottage with 6 other friends.
They're all smoking. I am not

And what do you know...I'm still laughing. I'm still having a great time. And I haven't even thought about cracking for a second.

Has the sleeping been hell? Yep. But do I see why this is the right decision? Fuck ya ! 

I can already tell this is one of the best decisions of my life. And I encourage you all to think about the positivity of this change. You will no longer be relying on a substance to be happy.. and that's  a beautifully powerful thing.

Cheers to every single person who is fighting the good fight and trying to better yourself and grow.
I'm proud of you all.

I started my journey 6 days ago, trying to kick my ""popper/moke/batch bowl""  habit (marijuana and tobacco in the bong) those are some names I've learned that people call them.  I was smoking about 3 - 5 big bowls a day. The last month I have hated it so much. I wanted to quit every single time I smoked, I promised God I would multiple times.  I even swore on my own life that I would stop but still smoked. 

Originally, I thought I just needed to stop the tobacco. I figured it was the devil of course and the cause of the problems. My very last bowl I blacked out (although not the first time, honestly I often smoked with this being the goal) smashed my face on the ground and puked for a good 5minutes. 

I never imagined that weed could also be a problem. I knew I needed to avoid weed for a while to kick the batch bowls, but originally I planned to get back into weed when I felt strong enough. 

Then enter this subreddit (is that the right term? I'm new!) Holy moly. 

In here, I learned that the withdrawls I was experiencing (night sweats, no appetite, insomnia) were actually from weed. I learned that I was ""confusing withdrawal me with sober me"". All this time I though the anxiety I was feeling, the rage, the sadness - was my natural state and I just needed that first bowl to make it all go away. But this whole time, that has be me withdrawing. I can't even believe it. 

Since I have stopped smoking  just 6 days ago, I feel like my entire outlook on life has changed. I am so free. I am not longer anxious, I am not filled with rage . I finally feel like I am the one in control of my life. 

I am drinking more water, I've started exercising, I am eating healthy. I care more about everyone in my life. I definitely feel sadness for the way I thought before -  how focused I was on getting high instead of my relationships.  But this is an important part of the process. 

If I had not come onto Reddit, I would have assumed that I could smoke weed again after a few weeks - as long as I didn't include the tobacco. But thanks to all of you wonderful people, I know now that the drug that I claimed to be harmless has actually been doing so so much harm.  

I am so excited for life now. I am so greatful.  I will not smoke with you today.",3

Overall in the last 12 years I’ve been sober for 6 months + these 24 days. 

I’ve always known I used weed to numb myself to not deal with the things I need to, not to mention it felt like it was freeing me from trauma from childhood and the associated anxiety + depression, until I felt trapped by the anxiety and depression caused from weed.

All the above to say, 24 days sober sounds good and is a win by some measures but why doesn’t it feel like it? Like I’m in limbo…. Drifting through this life…

Scared to commit to anything because I don’t trust myself. 

About to break up with my girl because I don’t love myself, so how the hell can I extend love I don’t feel for me to her? 

Dependency on my parents financially and emotionally, though at this age I should be there for them.

The last time I took a  t break, I was plagued with absolutely terrifying and vivid dreams and immediately resumed consumption to curb them.

We’re talking incredibly disturbing imagery and dreams so traumatic I can still recall the really horrible details years later. I’m lucky enough to not have a lot of trauma, so my dreams aren’t disturbing on a personal sense, but they would almost always end up with me dying in a horrible way, and just very very disturbing imagery. It makes me feel insane that my brain can even come up with the things that I’ve dreamed about. I would not consider myself a violent person and I do not indulge in gore videos so it’s just frightening when I wake from a dream where I watch someone get decapitated or disemboweled, or look in the mirror and watch as my teeth rot out of my face and crumble into pieces.

i dunno what i need or why i’m posting this. i just know that being here with you all, fellow cannabis quitters, gives me comfort and i’m grateful for the outlet and the camaraderie.

I have had depression and ADHD for years, so I’m not sure how to get out of this hole. I’m 23 and still living at home while commuting to school. A lot of my friends either still are on the stoner grind or are off doing their own things, so I just find myself lost and unsure of what to do. I realize a big reason I smoked so much is because I hated the feeling of being depressed and lonely, it always gave me some comfort in realizing that life wasn’t as bad as I thought. 
Can anyone help?",9
2022-02-26 10:42:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/t1zw93/i_almost_cracked_yesterday_but_i_didnt/,"I almost cracked yesterday, but I didn’t!!","I had THE MOST stressful day at work yesterday, and caught myself thinking all throughout the day *I can’t wait to get home and smoke a blunt*. I haven’t smoked since 2/20/22, so it hasn’t been long and my brain is still used to that being my coping mechanism. 

I was smoking almost every day for the past 5 years, with a few short ‘breaks’ in between. This past year I’ve been trying to face a lot of my past trauma, and I was in therapy for a while; this brought up emotions that I was so scared to deal with, so I would constantly smoke to numb myself. Decided last week that I can no longer do that. After only a few days, I felt brighter, more energetic, and my brain fog had significantly cleared up; also, I’m no longer binge eating and don’t even care to eat that unhealthy anymore - which was a significant cause of my weight gain this past year.

Recently, my job has been the primary cause of my stress. I work in mental health and while I’m dealing with my own, it’s been extremely draining - the management I work under doesn’t help. I actually put in my notice not too long ago, so I’ll be leaving in a couple months. A weight has been lifted off of my shoulders since I made this decision, but it doesn’t make the day by day much easier.

Yesterday I got home, and I was prepared to engage in all of the negative coping mechanisms - I was logged into dominoes, trying to order far too much food for one person; I brought out a box stash I knew I had extra edibles in; I was ready to just go back to square zero. But, I took a moment and thought to myself *am I really going to break this easy, and this quickly*? Then I thought about all the reasons I decided to stop, and how this also wouldn’t help in my weight loss journey. I was able to convince myself how much it wouldn’t be worth it, so I ended up making a sandwich, watching a tv show instead, and went to bed early.

I’m so proud of myself for not giving in, and I believe that thinking back to that one decision will help me in later times were I’m tempted. 

Thanks for reading :) Here’s some *discipline* quotes that I’ve been reading the past few days:

*Self-discipline is when your conscious tells you to do something and you don’t talk back*

*Motivation gets you going, but discipline keeps you growing*

*Discipline is choosing between what you want now, and what you want most*

*Suffer the pain of discipline, or suffer the pain of regret*",15

The severity of withdrawals kept me going 🪖,"11 year + daily smoking career here. Cigs for 15. I’m 30 years old. 

I quit weed cold turkey late November 2021. I realized that for a while smoking weed didn‘t really feel good anymore. So l‘ll just quit, right?! Not like it’s addictive or anything. 
A quick google search tells me 2-4 weeks of withdrawal and you’re good to go. 
Boy was I wrong. 
Crippling anxiety and depression haunted me for the first month maybe 2. As anxiety got a bit better the depression was ramping up. I spent my second month in an outpatient addiction center. It was helpful but very focused on alcohol.
In my third month I was put on a low dose of meds against my depression, which have helped a little with sleep but not really with my perspective on life and my moods. 

The only reason I have not gone back to weed is because the intensity of symptoms made my realize what I had been doing to myself for so long.

After my first month off weed I decided to kick nicotine as well. I felt like I was smoking way more cigs and replacing the weed addiction. I’m 60 days off the cigs now.

I still get quick flashes of derealization, which last for a few seconds and feel sort of like a mini panic attack. In the mornings I struggle to get out of bed and I’m questioning just about everything in my life: Job, relationship of 7 years, life goals. One of the saddest things was realizing that I don’t even know what makes me happy. Weed was my identity and so was smoking in general. 

Some might say I was functional as I have a decent job and had many aspects of my life in order. But underneath I was/am an unhappy stoner whose only goal was to get high and treated it like his only hobby. Please tell me it gets better. I’m hanging on but it’s hard. Still very much day by day and reading this sub sometimes for hours on end. I’m hoping that one day I can lead a normal sober life. Whatever that means.
Thank your for reading. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Always happy to chat with people of similar smoking background/quitting journey.

2022-02-26 08:23:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/t1x0jb/dealing_with_anxiety/,Dealing with anxiety,"Currently at day 25 after 10 years of pretty much daily usage with some max. two month attempts at quitting. I also quit alcohol/nicotine, because I feel like I might just have an addictive personality and issues with impulse control and every relapse was when I had been drinking or using something beforehand.

Almost a month into my recovery process I notice I suffer from pretty serious bouts of anxiety. Although the frequency decreases (first four days were horrible, then I was fine for a week, two horrible days, two good weeks, two bad days now) it is pretty debilitating to deal with while also working and having other important things going on (friends and their family in Ukraine atm for example). It is like I'm mentally in a room with a tennisball machine that pellets me with negative thoughts and while I can deal with cq. block nine out of ten balls the one in ten that hits me in the balls, so to speak, fells me. When the machine turns on there is also a massive well-lit exit-door with a colorful sign that reads “WEEEEEEEED”, to complete the analogy.

The main debate I am having with myself now it that while on the one hand I know most of these thoughts are due to my brain reconfiguring and the reptile brain trying to put me out of balance (proven by the decreased frequency), I also do not want to invalidate emotions and feelings that I have been avoiding in the last ten years and might be worth considering. Now I have massive difficulty distinguishing those two, becoming another issue by itself. I have a super hard time dealing with the unrest and I am cautious seeking help because I feel like I am not at my emotional baseline yet. 

Most of this is just a vent, but if any of you reading this have some tips or anything that can help me put this into perspective it would be greatly appreciated. For now, on to the next day - I’ll probably/hopefully feel better tomorrow anyway.",10

I never thought I'd be able to live without smoking heavy amounts of weed on a daily basis but here I am. The biggest changes for me have been - 

1. Sleep - Sound, deep, real sleep. I don't need to smoke before bed, and then again halfway through the night to go back to sleep

2. Remembering dreams - the dreams I have are way better than any stony thoughts I used to have, and I *remember* them now!

3. Financial stability - I'm not rich, and still not in my desired career, but I have money in my account. I have a savings and am not spending every spare dime on shatter or flower

4. Genuine connections with human beings - I can look people in the eye and have real, engaging conversations while actively listening to what they have to say

5. Self-confidence - I can look *myself* in the eye in a mirror and smile. I can walk around with my head held high as opposed to slouching and avoiding eye contact

6. Emotional stability - Emotions don't scare me anymore. I don't avoid or numb out my feelings. Anxiety still happens, but it comes and goes instead of being my resting state. The highs are higher and the lows aren't nearly as bad as they seemed before 

7. Productivity increase - I can go to the store without needing a 20 minute session before and after. I burn through to-do lists and spend my free time actually *doing* stuff

8. Reconnecting with old friends - I've been able to renew some friendships that were lost when weed was my best friend and only support system

9. Goal-orientation - I've been able to set realistic, achievable goals that can be focused on and worked towards versus the ambitious pipe dreams that were never realized

10. Love - I found love! I entered into a romantic relationship with a woman who doesn't come second to my addiction. I'm present, communicative, and open to compromise. I actually just proposed and she said YES!! 

The 4 things that help me, (and might help you) are -- 

1. Journaling - write stuff down. Emotions and thoughts are easier to deal with when they're layed out on paper and not stuck in your heart and head
2. Meditation - simple breathing meditations are tough at first but can be such a huge source of peace and centering; makes it easier to live in-the-moment
3. Prayer - this one might not be for everyone but has really helped me with gratitude, acceptance and a sense of purpose
4. This sub - y'all are the REASON I'm here. From lurking to commenting, to supporting others to posting my own success...I genuinely could not have done it without you. I have a small (but strong) support system irl but the support I received here has been priceless, and I hope to help others on their journey. Thank you, thank you, thank you! 🙏

Then i get home, and my boyfriends daughter who is pregnant and who I got a super nice 3 in 1 convert-able car seat for as a xmas present wants to return it bc its got pink trim and she doesn’t like it and wants all grey. and i cant return it bc i got $100 off bc wally world mis marked the price tag and plus its 2 months later, I have no idea where the receipt is. and it may not sound like a big deal but it felt like a slap in the face. 

then im in bed with boyfriend and im upset, he’s like, i thought we were watching this show together and I told him im upset and why and hes just like ‘its stupid to feel like that over dumb shit’ after i spent hours the other day calming him down and holding him and cheering him up when he got some bad news. no fucking hug for me and he just went on laughing at the show, told me i should smoke some weed

It’s been a ride. A bumpy one at that. I still struggle, I don’t fully feel like I’ve “broken through” yet. I no longer crave it, whenever I do I realize that there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. And I address it.

I was just sick of the high of smoking, it quickly become a low. Yes that’s right, the high was a low yet I chased it everyday. I’m sure a lot of you guys can relate with that. 

Weed used to be a nice tool to have in my toolbox but weed itself became the tool box and I became the tool (if that makes any sense). I miss it. But I’m an overall better individual without it.

Stay strong and continue your journey whether you’re 10 minutes, days, weeks or months into your journey. We deserve to be free.

It’s at night that it really hits me. My boyfriend, part of the reason I got sober, dumped me a week ago. I don’t have many friends where I am now. Extremely lonely. 

I would get high to escape that loneliness. To pass time. To feel something. 

It did NOT help, let me be clear. I spent half the time feeling like a paranoid, stoner loser. 

Now I feel like a sober loser. 

And yet I know it’s still better. I wish I’d never smoked weed, goddamn. I really thought I was so fucking cool and edgy. Goddamn man. I wish I could save my brother from the same fate.

I wanted to quit because like most of you I knew it was not a good long term lifestyle for one reason or another. So I turned to books since I’m abit of a reader and found this interesting idea in the neuroscience of addiction. The motivation centres of the brain dictate thoughts, actions and intentions. How common is it for us to one day say i never want to smoke again and then to switch up not long after and rationalise another puff. That’s because addiction of any kind biologically influences our conscious behaviours. So for those looking to quit it’s important to trust the process. Your mind has been trained to seek and enjoy weed at the expense of activities that would normally fulfil you. But over time your brain will retrain and your dopamine supplies won’t be dependent on the next puff but on other meaningful and positive things in your life.",8

I was a daily smoker for 3 years, however had reduced to a couple times a week in recent months because it wasn’t feeling as good as it used to. 7 days ago, I smoked more than normal and got super high which triggered a dissociative panic attack. 

The next morning, I felt normal, but decided to quit for good because the event was truly terrifying. For the next 2 days, I felt fine. Then day 3 with no weed hit, and it was filled with anxiety and intrusive thoughts, shaking, fogginess, nausea, and no appetite at all. I had to force myself to eat.

I’m 7 days in and I still go in and out of intense anxiety. There are times when I feel normal and relaxed, which gives me hope, but it doesn’t last. Seeing a psychiatrist in a couple days, but I came here for support. It’s hard to see the light at the end. I want to feel like my normal self again. It’s also hard coming to terms with the fact that the last 3 years of my life I’ve been dependent on this drug, so I’m struggling with who I am and my identity.

Long time lurker, first time poster here. Over the past year, I have realized that pot no longer serves a purpose in my life. After multiple failed attempts at getting clean (1 month is my longest streak), I am happy to say I am currently on day 5. However, I have noticed that this attempt is a little different from my last ones, as my physical withdrawal symptoms weren't even that bad this time around. On day 1 I only got like 3 hours of sleep that night and could barely eat dinner. From day 2 through now, however, sleep and appetite have largely returned to normal (except for periodically waking up in the middle of the night and sweating like a pig). I find this odd, because looking back on my past attempts I was always straight fucked for a week straight (insomnia, no appetite at all, etc). I find it even odder because the last wax I was smoking on was like 96% THC from the dispo lol.

I'm aware I'm not out of the woods yet, as I know and am fully prepared for the mental WD's to hit me like a sack of bricks (they usually do around week 2). I guess what I'm trying to say is, did anyone else expect their physical withdrawals to end so soon? I thought physical WD's took a little longer to clear up, around 1 week or so, maybe even longer. Guess I shouldn't be complaining though, haha.",3

I wasn’t a chronic smoker or anything, just wanted a positive change in life. So, I’ve been making it a challenge for myself to not use any substances for an extended period of time.

I got over the insomniac phase when first quitting, but there’s still some nights just like last night that I’ll be tossing and turning at 3:30 and think to myself; “I could really use some kush right now.” I still have a small amount of weed and resin on me at the moment so I am prone to relapse.

So i stopped smoking weed daily on December 4, 2021, and i have been pretty good about it for the most part. I have smoked about 5 times spaced since i stopped my daily habit, but now i feel so empty and bored all the time. I havent even liked the times that i have smoked bc now i get anxious and hyper aware of things, the fade is just too strong. It makes me miss having a tolerance, but im over picking up.

I’ve been trying to work out, and i’ve been pretty consistent. I got on some ADHD medication recommended by my psych, as i realized weed used to help me focus and get shit done a lot, but i havent really felt an improvement from the meds. I just don’t really have a passion, i’ve isolated my self from my friends, i feel like i have no part of me to share with anyone. I just feel like a shell of myself. I really feel like i wasted a good 5 years just smoking, and only socializing thru getting high and partying. Now i feel so lonely, and this gapping hole that weed left behind. I dont really know now to fill it. Smoking now doesnt even fill it. I am pretty confident i’m over smoking weed, but im not confident in what i’m going to do with these feelings that im left with now. 
I feel so ungrateful too. I have a degree, a good job, a loving family, a supportive & loving girlfriend. But i just can’t stop from sulking and feeling empty. 2017-2021 was spent smoking hella weed. I miss it but also it gave me these problems so i hate it",14

As someone who's absence from weed was spurred from losing a long term relationship (not necessarily due to weed but i believe it played a factor) i really dont see any situation where i can smoke and not need to be immediately be comforted by a partner.

For better or for worse, I think im done! Like i said, maybe if the time is right and the place is right i might engage in a few puffs off a joint with a friend or group (social use only), but like i said, i know whats going to happen, im going to get anxious.  Until im in a place where i know for a fact that wont happen (which may just as well be never) i wont be smoking.

It gets easier friends, you go from craving it to missing it to almost a distant memory.  Sure you will get bored or feel like you have nothing to do.

Like many of you I have struggled with my relationship with weed for much of my life. I’ve taken breaks of up to 3 months multiple times in my life but usually to get clean for job apps, so I knew there was always an end in site.

This is the first time I’ve quit in response to improving my life and recognizing my addictive relationship with substances. Truth be told, I’m surprised how easy it’s been 33 days in. The first week was tough as I experienced the classic withdrawal symptoms, and weekends can still be a challenge if I let myself get too bored.

But for those of you just getting started and struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel, it gets easier relatively quickly. I don’t feel like I need it to wind down at the end of the day anymore, and my exercise/hygiene habits are infinitely better than when I was using weed as my reward system.

I’m still not convinced I’ll never smoke again, but this is proof that I can live a fulfilling life that doesn’t revolve around weed. Life is simply better.

2022-02-25 12:10:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/t1917l/need_a_bit_of_support/,Need a bit of support.,"Hey guys,

I’m (18m) have been a daily smoker and drug user for a little under two years now, and on Christmas Eve I had a huge panic attack / OD where I combined weed with another substance. Ever since then I’ve had palpitations and my heart pounds like crazy whenever I smoke.

I’ve been off it for about two months now, with only the occasional joint here and there, but after speaking to my friend who smokes around 8 joints a day still I’m seriously considering going back to it. Life just isn’t the same for me anymore, I used to be able to find joy in the smallest little things and was content being bored and alone. Now it feels like life just isn’t the same, the buzz is gone, everything I used to find beauty in just got a bit uglier and it seems to be getting worse the longer I go. 

I put myself into a drug recovery program for not only weed but the other substances I used to abuse, but I’m so close to just saying **** it and going back to smoking, as my friend says the negatives will go away if I just force myself to smoke more, claiming she’s been through the same situation.

I know it’s the wrong choice, I know it will just mask how I already feel, but I feel like I’m at my wits end. I’ve long struggled with mental health and it feels like as soon as I went sober I dropped right back to square one. Part of me just wants to waste my life and be high and content rather than suffer with all these emotions and anxiety.

Has anyone ever been through a similar situation? How did you get out of it? Are there things I should be doing or things I shouldn’t be doing to help myself improve? And, most importantly, how can I get back that love for life and sense of identity I had without relying on a substance? Much love, thank you.",3

I was literally telling myself I won’t be able to sit down on the couch and watch a show anymore because weed made things interesting. WELL THAT WAS A LIE! I’m realizing how many limiting beliefs I’ve had, and I finally see the light! I’ve had some sleep issues and struggling to eat a lot but overall I feel so much better than being high all the time.

I also adopted a dog (been wanting to for awhile) the day I quit. So all of my thoughts and energy are going to him and I haven’t been depressed at all which is common for me. Also he’s keeping me accountable because I don’t want to be a lazy dog owner not walking him, and quite honestly I can’t afford a dog and smoking 1/2 oz a month + carts.

It hasn't been all bad there has been times it elevated my mood but it's also not been good for my mental health. I have a family history of psychosis and other mental health issues like depression. Also I've noticed that weed has always made me super paranoid, when I was at the height of my addiction I somehow managed to convince myself that I could somehow overcome that but I've never been able to do that. The bottom line is that weed makes me super paranoid and it's almost debilitating and leads me to becoming more self destructive and making bad decisions. I also want to clarify that I understand that it isn't this way for everyone but I think it's safe to say given my mental health and other factors that weed is just not a healthy substance for me. I've been sober for about 20 hours and I've decided I don't want to smoke weed before bed tonight. I have about a half ounce but I know as soon as I smoke it I'm gonna start tripping out and losing control of my head. So I wanna stay sober and keep this momentum going. I've taken a few tolerance breaks in the past and I've always felt better sober but as soon as I regain my grip on reality I inevitably end up sliding back into daily cannabis smoking and I know I can't allow this to go on anymore. This is my first post here and I  intend to keep updating on my journey towards sobriety and I would love to hear what you guys think I should focus on. I want to be sober for at least 6 months and I want to try to maintain sobriety as much as I can because I know that ultimately it's the only thing that's gonna help me make progress in my life. A few things I'm worried about is lack of sleep and appetite and of course I'm shaky and worried about withdrawal. If anyone has any tips or advice for me at this early stage in my journey please let me know. I want to try to tough out this first week and really start seeing that progress mentally and I can't wait to keep updating as I become more clear headed and sober minded.",8

Finding this Subreddit has helped me a lot in realizing I’m not alone in this struggle and helped me not beat myself up so much inside so thank you all for being so open and sharing your stories. Previously before (6-7 years ago) i would only smoke here and there, just with friends or my highschool gf, at some point after I graduated I completely lost myself. I started smoking everyday, would tell myself I focus better, I’m more social (This was a lie though. I used to be super outgoing and weed made me reclusive and almost given me what feels like permanent social anxiety) every excuse I have used to justify smoking every chance i could practically get. Throughout the past year and a half I’ve desperately wanted to quit, I’ll make it a week or even a month and I would always feel so much better physically and emotionally, I would workout and eat healthy again. then something would happen in my life and I would let that justify finding bud and hitting my bong all night till i didn’t feel any emotions and I was back to where I started. I’ve spent countless nights holding back tears because I know how addicted I am, the length I’ve went in the past to smoke because I was so lost in my addiction disgust myself, then I’ve used even this thought as an excuse to smoke to shut my emotions down. I feel like every single aspect of my life has been negatively impacted by my smoking. 

But that brings me to this week, the thought about stopping and my life before smoking hasn’t left my mind, every time I smoke it taste disgusting, the smell of any weed smells nasty. In the past I always kept items, told myself I’ll get to the point where I can smoke alone here and there but I’ve finally gotten rid of every last item I own related to smoking, and as I’m writing this I can hear the roaring sounds of the garbage truck taking that weight off my chest. 

I want this a to be it. I want to become a better man more than anything, I know it’ll be challenging and I know there’s chance of relapse but I refuse to give up this time.

I'm 22-year-old Male studying psychology, and I never imagined myself posting on Reddit about quitting weed. I never considered myself to be as addicted to it as other people who had been smoking for 15 years. But the last three years have been a blur of events that I can't even put a filter on. Just smoke until I would withdraw and then smoke again. Time spent with friends, family or uni could only be dealt with high. Or get high to not even deal with any responsibility.

I knew I had to stop after being diagnosed with ADHD and seeing the videos of Healthygamer GG and Andrew Huberman, but I couldn't until now. Even with Adhd medication, I kept on smoking and did not even try to change my life. Is it possible that I'm afraid of change?

After realising a while ago that my weed/ hash consumption is getting way out of hand, (and me not really being stoned) I tried quitting a couple times. I am currently a couple days sober after a “other drugs” trip (can recommend if you want to quit!!) and some specific “supplements”. 
My actually question is do you drink alcohol during the first couple days/ weeks? Yesterday i had a couple beers with friends and that little voice suddenly wakes up that i want to smoke some. Luckily I was strong this time but I remembered that i have collapsed with weed after alcohol consumption. Goodluck today with your battles, and I hope you have a wonderful day!",1

After reading some posts I don’t think I had it as intense as others here. I’d do about a bowl a night. Anyway on Monday I had my first sober night since Thanksgiving. I was amazed at how much energy and motivation I had. Then last night I got baked, and when I woke up I was groggy and out of it all day. I decided I was gonna quit maybe all together maybe just for a few months I haven’t made up my mind for how long. Still when I got home from work I took all my stuff and put in the basement where it’s out of the way and inconvenient to grab. 

However I’m trying to sit down and play Mass Effect 2 a game I’ve loved since long before I started smoking. I’m really craving a hit. During Thanksgiving I had to travel to see family and I had no access to weed, but the third day the thought of smoking had completely slipped my mind. So I know it gets better, but any advice for getting through those first few days?

Edit: I forgot to mention I think part of the reason I’m craving it so bad aside from it being a habit is because it’s now the “forbidden fruit” it’s all the more tempting now.",1

Day 3..,"So a couple months back I put up a post on here asking “when would be a good time to start smoking after being sober 2/3 months?” (The post was taken down so other people didn’t get the wrong idea like myself).

From that day, I began smoking again and within a week I was back to smoking near €150 worth of weed a week. Bare in mind this was my first time smoking without a full-time job which genuinely destroyed me. I went from being the most sober I’ve been in four years to the worst I’ve been in four years.

Sitting at home simply watching life go by through my window (s/o Juice). It’s funny to as the only reason I managed to get to day 3 is because my dealers were out and I’ve just said screw it, I want my life back. Sometimes the escape doesn’t have to be planned, you just have to play the cards dealt in front of you.

So here I am, starting this near never ending battle but I have faith this time. Life is to be lived, not observed through a screen. I hope to return to this page in a years time and celebrate my sobriety like I see so many others do.

Recovery is always possible, you just have to believe it.

I’m about to turn 36 and I’m struggling and I don’t want to fight this anymore. The last year I’ve managed to stop for a month here, couple weeks there. I’ve been going to therapy and have had some huge breakthroughs.. but I always seem to relapse. And I’m pretty sure it’s because I don’t have anyone to hold me accountable. I’ve created this secret space for myself in my close relationships where I don’t have to be accountable because I don’t share that I’m struggling with anyone. Even my partner whom I am so close to.

I’m so tired of feeling out of control and ashamed of myself. I want to be present. I want to feel my feelings. But feeling just scares the shit out of me!

&#x200B;

anyways, i always thought i was a chronic procrastinator due to anxiety--i get shit done but i put it off until i can't anymore, then i rush and get it done and feel guilty, all the while feeling more anxiety than is really necessary. the worst example i can think of is putting of submitting the final piece of paperwork i needed for a significant increase in job prospects and pay--i guess i just felt like i could always do it later, even though i knew logically i should just knock it out and be done.

&#x200B;

quitting 2 weeks ago was a decision i had also put off for awhile (who'd of thunk) but i can honestly say i have been SO productive at home and at work. it started as a way to keep myself busy but honestly?? i feel this internal motivation to push myself and get things done, to tangibly move forward in my life, even in the smallest of ways. each time i get something done early i've been thinking about how 2 months ago i would've put it off to smoke and """"relax"""" aka not do anything that was remotely personally challenging. i felt like i constantly deserved a break, even though i wasn't working all that hard.

&#x200B;

i have this wall in my apartment where i put tons of sticky notes that each have a task on it, anything from going to the gym, picking up groceries, or calling my parents. when i get that item done i move it to the other side of the wall, where i'm slowly creating a huge post-it note snail lmao. i have no idea why but it has helped so much while quitting--its a tangible way for me to reinforce myself and see just how much i've been doing in a short period of time. 

&#x200B;

anyways, i guess this is a ramble all to say--keep going, you WILL feel better, and your motivation and drive WILL come back. if a to-do list isn't your thing, find another way to track your progress; celebrate the little milestones; if something takes 5 minutes or less, do it now; and keep reminding yourself that you can feel good \*and\* relaxed without weed, even moreso. :-)

During the past year, I have been smoking pretty frequently ( about 4 times a week) with some exceptions which are attempted quitting attempts ( which usually last about a week or 2 ). I am 18 years and a freshman in university studying computer science and I have been having so much work that I can't waste time smoking anymore. I have many goals but they are unachievable unless I use my free time to work towards them instead of smoking. Usually, I smoke at nighttime (around 8 pm). I justify it to myself by saying something like ""I finished my work for the day so it's time to reward myself."".  

 I've been looking at this subreddit recently and after seeing all of the experiences many of you have had, I know I need to quit weed for good. It's just so strange because in the first half of my day I have 0 inclination to smoke, but after I finish my work and go hang out with some friends, they ask me if I'm down to go on a walk with them (a walk = smoke), and at that moment, I just give in and say sure. I know the consequences that weed has for me, but at that moment when I decide to smoke or not, its like everything I have previously planned about stopping smoking goes out the window, and I end up going to smoke with them. I usually have a very strong mindset for many things I do in life, but its almost like I have no control over myself when it comes to smoking. This really does scare me but its such a convenient thing to do to relax at the end of the day.

In the past, I have made multiple attempts to stop smoking, but they all end up failing. It usually goes like this: The first few days go by easy, but after about a week hits, I start to lose my mindset I initially had for stopping smoking and as I watch others around me smoke, I start getting urges to join them until I finally do and my attempt at quitting is over.

&#x200B;

I wasted all my 20s being high but now feel like ive turned a leaf and feel much better sober and in my senses. No more puffy red eyes or an appetite controlled if i had smoked or not. In these first ten days i can say i thought they would be many sleepless tossing and turning nights but i have had no such problem. Ive had the nightsweats but nothing majorly like alot others i hear on here. Also since quitting ive given up fizzy drinks as i use to drink cola with a joint. Ive had 0 to little urges even when being around my brothers who still smoke just getting used to finding stuff to do in spare time like getting closer to God and working out.,15

I have been taking the no weed till night approach because what better time to feel lethargic and sleepy than night. What i mean by it helps you sleep but not on time is you smoke that night jay then sit on the couch watching or playing bullshit. Then you get munchies and get up to eat. After you eat it brings the high away so you might want to smoke again. After that smoke you have major couch lock and sometimes id be so ready to sleep that it takes me 25 minutes to turn off the tv and get from the couch to my bed. A very simple task it takes will power for me to do smh. Idk if im making sense but most people who smoke want to enjoy their high so smoking to sleep is pointless in a way because you’ll end up spending hours past your bed time trying to enjoy your high had you just gon to sleep. 

All those minutes of knowing you need to get up to use the bathroom, get up for food, whatever it is but you’re couch lock is so strong it makes that 1 minute task turn into 10 all adds up and you end up being awake at 12am from something that should “help you sleep”",1

Now, I can't usually smoke during the day, but I feel anxious the whole day. I rush through or procrastinate assignments so that I can ""finally"" smoke. I run through a cycle of Smoking, then producing rushed, mediocre work, then having more work to catch up/fix it, which leads to more stress, which can only be cured by smoking.

I hate how much I crave weed. It frustrates me a lot seeing friends being able to smoke weed because they can moderate usage. Meanwhile, I have to consider abstinence because I'm not able to. I sound like a kid, but why me?

I know people are different. I don't crave alcohol much at all while other people's lives are ruined by alcoholism.

Growing up in a strict and abusive family it was the only way I could cease my thoughts and worries. I remember the first time I got high it was like all of the noise and constant thinking that was bombarding my head making it feel so heavy kind of faded into silence. And man I loved that silence. All the pain I felt from living in my toxic environment and the suffering of my mental health, it just felt like a break. I loved that nothingness. To be able to focus on nothing, to feel nothing, to think of nothing. For once, to let go of control. 

But then it became destructive. Another poison that entered my world. I neglected important parts of my life. Severed meaningful connections. Chasing after the high day after day. It was a crutch. Until in 2019 I decided that I would quit for good. Before the pandemic started, I did live on my own and had managed to stay completely sober from weed, alcohol, and drgs for that entire year. It was hard at first, but I was fine, I was able to do it, I was in peace, I was happy, I was proud of myself. I felt like my life was going in the right direction. Then the pandemic happened…

Forced to move back home from college was the ultimate test for me. I managed to stay another 6 months sober back in my toxic environment. But then it all came back. My mental health back at its lowest states. The depression, the suicidal thoughts, the anxieties were triggered by the arguments, constant fighting, and stress from my home life. Spending each night crying, not getting any sleep, the pain getting heavier in my heart until I just couldn’t take it anymore. That’s when I reunited w MJ. But this time around, the highs weren’t the same. It wasn’t that euphoric, exciting feeling I used to get. It was just numbness. But I was more than willing to take the numbness over the pain. After many cycles of quitting and starting again, quitting and starting again, here I am today. 

I go to work, go home, have my daily fights w my family, get high, go to sleep, rinse and repeat. For those few hours I can forget everything about my life, forget the stressors of my day, and then do it again the next. Wondering when I’ll stop depending on this? Or am I doomed to be a stoner forever? Will this numbness be the only comfort I’ll feel in this life? I’m so afraid that if I stop MJ I’ll go back to that dark and dreary abyss of suicidal ideation, depression, relived trauma, and constant anguish. I can’t decide which is worse. It’s just so hard. 

I do go to therapy I’ve been going for 4-5 years, but I also live in rural USA as a POC making minimum wage. Our health system is extremely shitty and for people like me, therapy hasn’t been the all cure solution. I’ve been through 3 therapists in the past year because they stop taking Medicaid. I also had to deal w therapists who have had racist and prejudiced attitudes. Shaming me for my addiction. Shaming me for mental health and my lived experiences. I’ve been admitted through in patient psychiatric care after a suicide attempt. But it made me worse tbh. The psychiatrist took a 2 min survey and then told me right to my face “Congratulations you’re depressed”. They gave me psychiatric rx which I got hooked on and then used weed to get through those withdrawals. And yes, I’ve tried meditation. It’s alright. I can’t stick to it bc I’m constantly working and exhausted since I’m part of this capitalistic society. And if I do try to meditate I start dissociating and get more anxiety. 

Honestly I’m not really looking for advice I guess I just wanted to share what I’m going through. I don’t want to rely on weed anymore. I don’t want to be a person who is addicted. But also, this life is so hard and shitty and I don’t think I’ll last much longer on this earth. I don’t have any close friends just you guys on this forum. So I don’t know if there’s a solution for me really. My plan was to move out but I only make minimum wage since my degree is pretty useless and got tons of debt and loans to pay off plus my credit is absolutely shit. I’m currently taking programming courses hoping it’ll get me a better paying job to pay off my debt but I guess we’ll see how that works out. 

But yeah life is shit and I’m just surviving rn. Not living. Surviving.",10

So I decided maybe it’s time for me to stop. I felt like at this point I was just smoking to smoke. I wouldn’t even enjoy the high any more. I’ve never thought about weed as being addicting, until now. The first day or two, the cravings were real. I’d be doing literally anything & the thought of smoking would randomly pop into my head. Now that I’m on day 5, I’ve been start to experience headaches throughout the day, & at night, I’ve been getting cold sweats. The other thing throwing me off is the vivid dreams. My whole life I’ve never been one to have dreams or nightmares. I’ve always kinda struggled with sleep, but not like this. Just an hour ago I woke up because I was having an intense nightmare & when I woke up I found myself drenched in sweat.. I thankfully don’t have the desire to smoke right now, but I do feel like shit. One other thing I’ve noticed is that I’m also extremely irritable. I’m curious to know what are some stuff you all do to help with all this? I really want to stick with being sober, but having some sort of support would be great. My family doesn’t know that I’ve been a smoker & definitely don’t know I’m going through this. But hopefully this helps someone, and myself. Thanks.",1

Towards the end of last year I discovered I have ADHD and that's a large part of the reason it ""helped"" me and then did the opposite once my brain got used to it (great videos on youtube about how it interacts with ADHD). It's a real ADHD trap. I don't think weed is the worst thing in the world, especially when you're depressed, but after years I'm finally starting to break out of that and look towards a positive future. My girlfriend and I have been together 3 years now and want kids in the next couple of years, and that's one big reason. The other is that I have artistic dreams, aspirations, and I'm just not as sharp when I'm smoking.

When you smoke it's so easy to be content. Hell the first night after quitting I realised how dusty my place was (I have dust allergy) and how I'd been sleeping through it thanks to weed. Spent all of monday deep cleaning my place, and I feel much better now.

Weed is like a shortcut to dopamine. Without it, you have to do hard things to get dopamine - work out, really engage with books and TV and videogames, pursue your dreams and goals. Why do any of that when dopamine is just a hit away? It kills your motivation to do those things, and then before you realise it you're dead and missed out on your life goals. I've seen too many people - including my father - go through life suppressing the things they should be dealing with by smoking weed. Push it down, push it down. Forget that you once wanted to be an animator, an artist, a programmer. Instead of apologising to people you need to apologise to, just put it off another day. Weed makes it easy to be content.

So yeah, after quitting you can suddenly feel very discontent. Very angry. Emotions can resurge. But that's natural! That's part of the cycle of life. You need to feel low sometimes to motivate yourself to make things better (not talking about depression btw - that is different and not natural).

I've actually been looking forward to this now, I'm excited about pursuing those goals. I'm back to the gym. I realise that I can't just drop the weed, I have to replace that dopamine. So I'm replacing it with the joy of cooking (instead of takeaway) and making delicious meals - healthy dopamine. Destroying at the gym, having next-level sex, and pursuing those life goals. It's still only day 3 and I'm suffering through night sweats, but I look forward to having my sharpness back. 

For those still struggling, best of luck. I think for me I'm happy and ready to move on from my old friend weed. It helped me through some tough times but it's become just a crutch, and even something holding me back, and I don't need it anymore.",22

Like the title says, withdrawing from weed after smoking all day everyday is no joke and can cause you temporary pain in exchange for slowly pumping the life back into you. When I’m on a 14 day + break, I feel like myself again, which is an invaluable feeling. The ugly truth is, if you smoke weed everyday and have withdrawal effects, you should consider the possibility that you might have a substance abuse disorder. That may sound scary, but life’s scary and you have to face the facts instead of hiding from them. 

Now when I smoke weed, I abuse it. When I go off of it, I withdraw. For me, the easiest way to fail is to give in to the withdrawals. Your brain will scream that you can’t survive without it, but of course, you can, and you will. 

When I withdraw, I think of myself as having the flu. What do you do when you’re sick? Only things your body feels up for. Exercise and other coping methods are great of course. But, your body wants to do whatever it takes to beat the bug. If you have to lay in bed all day to stay sober for the day, then that’s what you do. Focus on staying sober for the present and you WILL endure and you WONT be sick anymore. The brain has an amazing ability to self heal.

-posting here to support others and get some support myself

-going for a long warm shower and finishing it with cold water

-30 minutes of meditation

-Recovery Dharma meeting I'll attend tonight

Taking it week by week and while the first week was tough to fall asleep, but overall I felt SO. MUCH. BETTER. 

Within a week I got back to exercising, eating better as I didn’t have late night binge eating sessions after smoking a nightly bowl or two, I was breathing better, dreaming again, life just felt amazing starting with the end of week 1. 

Things started to change slowly but surely once I started to come down with something unrelated to this. I started getting lower back and kidney pain, and have gone to a couple of different doctors trying to find an answer. The only thing they can conclude is that it’s most likely a UTI, but the pain has prevented me from exercising, which didn’t seem like a huge deal at the time, but I feel it’s taking a toll on me. My stress is increasing due to it and some stress dealing with tough co workers at my job, relationship stress, and also as I’ve been sick, realizing how awful my health insurance is and the constant co pays and fees which have added financial stress. 

Normally I’d smoke just to relieve a little of this, or take some meds they gave me to help relax such as muscle relaxers, but the one night I took them, I woke up with some horrific side effects that had my heart racing and I’m terrified to take them again. The antibiotic prescribed to me also causes some strange side effects that my doctor advised to stop taking them. 

So here I am, at 3:32 AM wide awake, still with pain that started at week 2, with meds that aren’t safe for me to take, and it’ll be another week at the earliest until I can switch insurance plans and go to a doctor I trust more. 

I realize this is getting long, but with all of the stress listed above as well as me being prone to anxiety, this week has suddenly become just as difficult if not more than the first few nights when I decided to stop, and I just don’t know what else to do or how to cope with ongoing pain on top of stress that I used to manage by just having a small bowl before bed. Any thoughts, or just reading this means a lot. Appreciate you taking the time to do so, friends.",2

It's honestly pretty devastating how alien I have become through the daily use of high concentrate THC through black market carts. It all started in my sophomore year of highschool. It was something I would do on the weekends with my friends, but as many have detailed on this sub, it can quickly become a daily thing, and it certainly did for me. 

Before I started, I was a pretty smart kid with lots of potential. But after smoking so excessively, I began to experience my mind collapse, with all of my childhood notions and memories along with it. I felt like I was almost watching my life through a tv screen. Weirdly enough, I was still able to ace pretty much all of my classes in highschool. But still, I felt like my personality had almost vanished in front of my eyes, with only a soul, or consciousness, left to manage. 

I am 20 years old now and have just withdrawn from all of my classes at my college because of the effects that I'm experiencing now. Having done extensive research on the effects of usage during adolescence, I have become rather hopeless and even suicidal. I worry that the synaptic pruning and development of my prefrontal cortex must have been severely stunted. Not to mention my hippocampus, which has probably reduced in size. 

Anecdotally, even after a month of sobriety, I feel almost empty inside, unable to think, or even remember what it is like to be me, or human. That's why I had to withdraw from this semester of college, as my classes were confusing the hell out of me. 

The only reassurance I have right now is the largest twin study to-date which found no difference in IQ between twins using in adolescence (albeit in smaller quantities and over less time).

The reason I have written out this long post is I would both like to warn current adolescents of continuing their use, but I would also like some opinions or anectodotes of people who have gone through a similar process and have perhaps made it through the hell I am in right now.

(TLDR: I probably permanently fucked up my brain with my daily weed usage. So kids don't smoke that  pot, mmkay? And, two, anyone else have similar experiences?, hopeful or not I would like to hear them. Thanks)",1

I have been vaping high% THC strains almost daily for about 3.5yr (28f) for pain management and insomnia, and I decided on Feb 12 I was gonna stop cold turkey. First few days were absolute torment lol. Don't normally deal with depression but I was hit so bad I couldn't stop crying over little things. Sometimes I cried for literally no reason at all then cried more because ""why am I crying for no reason?"" lol


I used to have really vivid dreams every night before I started vaping and as a writer, it really fuelled my creativity. I wrote down my dreams every morning and have 100s of logs going back to 2010. I noticed in 2018/2019 my dreams really stopped being as vivid and creative as they used to and I barely remembered any of them (maybe a handful per week). Didn't think anything of it. I wasn't even vaping every day at that point. 


I have a ""line a day"" journal that keeps track of 5 years at a time, and I noticed in 2019 I started writing entries about how my writing muse is gone, why can't I write anymore, I have no focus to write...Used to be able to write 5+ hours straight in a day before weed lol. It made me really depressed, thinking something was wrong with me, why can't I just write?! Must be because I'm stressed, so of course I would vape more lol.



Well, I am currently writing a novel (since November 2021) and I lost a lot of steam in Dec and Jan (when I really started vaping a lot more because of stress), and ever since I stopped vaping, I am able to crank out 4-6hrs a day writing!! Just passed the 300 page mark the other day after writing 5hrs and I finally feel like myself again. I am crying just typing this up.



Writing is the one thing that brings me unbridled joy no matter what, and for a long time, weed took over like some insidious ivy, crawling into the foundation of who I was as a person. Weed was the only thing that made me happy. Yesterday was really tough. I cried so much I couldn't breathe. But today I woke up at 8am and wasn't groggy for the first time in literal years. I tried a new recipe and cooked a delicious lunch for me and my mom. I wrote for hours today and I am really enjoying my novel in a way I hadn't been able to enjoy since the beginning of working on it.



I had four vivid dreams the night before, and one long dream last night. I am sure I am not out of the woods yet, but I am so close I can taste it. I put all my weed stuff in a tin and put it up on my closet shelf. I was told by my weed dr that you can't get addicted to weed, but I think the hell yes you can lol. I thought ""I don't need it...I don't need it..."" like that episode of spongebob lol. 



I am just so happy to finally be writing again with real motivation and drive, and passion! My gods, there is so much passion behind my words now that I lacked for years. I had to always trick myself into writing even just for twenty minutes. Now I gotta STOP myself from writing because I gotta have a twenty min break to eat and stretch lol it's nuts. I can't stop and it's an exciting, jittery feeling. It's invigorating!! 



I really don't want to smoke weed anymore at all. My sleep is actually regulating itself again after the first few days of intense insomnia. First night I didn't smoke, I was tossing and turning until 6am before my body just shut off from exhaustion. But I am actually tired before 12am now. I am starting to feel actually rested for the first time in years lol. Weed was actually making my insomnia worse, I think. Huh.



Anyway, sorry for rambling. I am just so excited to see what I will find the motivation to write next after I am done my novel. I should be done soon at this rate lol. I have a few ideas for new projects. I read a book cover to cover in one sitting the other day for the first time in a long time. Working on reading a second book right now. This ""return to self"" is powerful. More addicting than weed, I hope lol. So far it is, at least. 



I hope anyone struggling right now is able to power through just one more day. Take it one day at a time. We got this. We are gonna come out the other side as better versions of ourselves!! We just gotta keep reminding ourselves who we are capable of becoming, and strive to be that person. We got this. We got this!",16

So its evening and I feel great. No beer either. that is my goal. just be sober across the board. no beer no weed. someone commented on my last post saying to replace the bad habits with good ones. and I’ve been learning the guitar, and its always really hard to get myself to sit down and do it, but after a conversation with my guitar teacher, he suggested and stated to never approach playing my guitar as practice, instead think of it as meditation or communing with the Great Beyond from which all inspiration and musings come from for me. And make it a stopping place everyday, so Im gonna use that to change my headspace after work instead of beer and weed. 

But I feel much more capable to handle my responsibilities over the next couple months. theres a lot i have to get done. and quitting weed is definitely the right decision right now.

Now I’m just all around lethargic and not really craving nic or thc, just don’t want to do anything at all… including smoke, so that’s good!

I quit the first week of the year, then smoked on day 6 and everyday there after. I remember it being the end of January and I’m like wtf, where did January go? Time flew by. I am glad that days are real now, just waiting to be back to 💯!

I’m expecting the worst and hoping for the best. Expecting it to take a year to be like a “normal person”… :/

I’m not even close BUT, “NEVER GIVE UP ON A GOAL BECAUSE OF THE TIME IT WILL TAKE, THE TIME WILL PASS ANYWAYS”

Ima arrive in a year no matter what I do. Be strong, be sober

I’ve quit many times. Ouch. This is the longest I have made it in quite a while.

I know I don’t want to relapse and am confident that I will stay sober in 2022.

Slowly realized how much I've been held back school-wise, career-wise, and motivation-wise by it. Fell into the trap of thinking it made me more creative, used it as a crutch socially to reduce my anxiety talking to strangers and potential partners. What made me want to stop is seeing my dad trying to function day to day at his age while still being a heavy daily smoker. If I can barely handle the stress of being a depressed NEET, what hope would I have of handling the stress of the career that I want, the family I want, the life I want to live? I can tell my friends just see me as an immature stoner who actively works against achieving anything, and I'm sick of being that in their eyes because they truly do want to see me happy and I don't want to let them down anymore. I just feel selfish because I want to have it all, I want to be able to have my life and smoke too but I just need to accept that might not be possible. I'm already thinking about how I could cut back ""once I get back to it"", but a part of me feels like I'll just relapse into using it as a crutch. I'm trying to not separate the feeling of being high from all of the negatives, trying so desperately to convince myself that life will be better without it but I'm struggling to believe it.",2

1)When you run out and suddenly your dealer ghosts you. 
2)when you get a bag and smoke it too quickly, then you kick yourself for smoking it that fast cause you could've used a sesh now. 
3) when you have to spray/wash or brush your teeth excessively to mask the stinky ganja brooo. 
4) if you're in an illegal area, waiting for dealers can be fucking annoying and anxiety inducing- especially if you're waiting outside it makes you feel like a crackhead 
5) losing interest in the music you used to love, cause you used to listen stooned.
6) thinking about how much you smoke and lung cancer, this is especially depressing if you're really young and you know you should quit early.
7) forgetting important stuff and having your day ruined or having a mini panic attack.
8) when you can't have fun without smoking, and it makes you sad because you remember a time you were happy without having to inhale smoke- it sounds pathetic when you really think about it.
9) when it starts to annoy people around you, maybe you don't look like you're listening to them or they see you've changed but not in a good way, It's a major turn off for some people. 
10) when you can't sleep because you're withdrawing, and you're staring at your phones clock go from 9pm to 1am in afew minutes.",3

the tragic news is that i (25F) have a best friend (25M) of 12 years. we met freshman year of high school and have been close ever since. he never ever was interested in smoking weed. i started smoking weed in high school and i’m pretty sure he low key judged me for it and thought i was a degenerate hahaha but eventually we went to college and went to different schools. he became a big drinker and partier! which was cool but i was NEVER into alcohol i just wanted to smoke weed. 

he partied all throughout undergrad and never once smoked weed. while we were in undergrad i ended up having a psychotic episode from my chronic cannabis habit and was hospitalized and went through months of treatment to get me back on track. by the time i was 21 i went completely stone cold sober and quit weed and i’ve been sober ever since. i’ve been really happy though despite the temptations. 

but the biggest temptation of all has just fell in my lap. i called my best friend on the phone and he told me that for the last few months he has picked up a stoner habit!!! i actually screamed i was so amazed and shocked. he smokes regularly now he said. i spent the next 45 minutes of our conversation telling him everything i possibly knew about smoking weed and all my stoner stories.

I was what I would consider a very high-functioning stoner for years. Held a good job managing/training people, never smoked at work, but sometimes beforehand. Was also taking care of my parents during their end of life, so between the two it was a LOT to manage by myself, but I held it all together and mostly smoked at night or the occasional day off where I had no other obligations.

Eventually my parents conditions worsened, and I eventually lost both of them. I didn't realize it at the time, but my weed usage shot up considerably right then. There was a ton of stress, I was largely alone in life, and the friends I did have were not very supportive, and all smoked weed constantly (and of course, I did as well).

It's been a few years since then now, I left the job on my own terms, am making enough money to live and totally independent. But my weed usage shot through the roof, to incredibly high levels. Dabs in the morning, as well as 100-300mg of edibles most days. I was always high, to the point where it felt normal. As if that was my base state of being.

I got to the point where depression and despair completely took hold. Nothing felt like it improved my mood or attitude, and weed seemed to at least mitigate some of the anger and shame. My living situation hasn't been great these last couple years, and my anger was just making it worse for myself and others. It became a self-perpetuating cycle of despair and lashing out at anything I came across. 

Today I woke up, made a cup of coffee, and cleaned the bong for the last time. Something about the idea of putting it away as it was felt as if it was ready to go, ready to be used again. But clean, empty of water, and tucked away in a drawer it feels a bit different. I will get rid of it with time, but this is the first step.

i made the conscious decision to finally quit after smoking weed every day for 4 years and i’m glad i did. but right now everything sucks and i don’t know what to do with myself and with all this time. 

there’s been a lot of crying and i puked earlier. been walking around feeling like i have a major hangover - is this normal? i’ve tried to quit 2 or 3 times before and it’s weird that i don’t remember the withdrawal symptoms. 

anyway, long story short, i’m just realizing now how much i used cannabis to subdue myself in a way because ppl have always made me feel like i’m too much or i’m too intense. so i would smoke cuz it mellowed me out, but also, why give access to ppl who want me to be less of who i am? it’s like, here’s a dissociative version of myself that may be more digestible - enjoy. and as a result of feeling othered, i just don’t enjoy being around ppl much. most of the time i feel drained after a social interaction and i feel like nothing i have to say matters to anyone anyway. so i would smoke, and i’d feel— well, i don’t remember the last time i felt amazing after smoking. i think i’d just not feel so shitty and so i kept at it. 

are there any tips on how to stave off the nausea and body pain? anything for the pot of untethered emotions i’m stewing in right now? i’m working with my naturopath as i get clean but it’s not the same as having someone who has the lived experience share what to expect and how to kick those urges in their stupid faces.

i’m in therapy and working specifically on Compassionate Inquiry, so i’m not usually so negative. withdrawal from my favorite friend is just the shittiest state to be in right now.

i’m so glad i found this sub and i’m so grateful to everyone who’s shared so openly and honestly. never thought a sub would be the one supportive factor for me throughout all this and yet here we are :)

I was suffering from extreme nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, stomach and abdominal pain and insomnia but it has gotten so much better but I'm completely exhausted now.

Up until day 4, I was having a hard time keeping even water down my stomach and it was hard but symptoms got better and I was able to eat small meals without vomiting. I have a slightly sensitive stomach so it may have been due to it that my symptoms have been worse. 

Mentally, I am feeling better now, it's like I got a part of my intelligence back after quitting. I see the difference now that I'm feeling more happy and getting all those chores done that were subsided when I was stoned. 

I loved weed and I would try to stay high all the time even at work. Yes I was an addict and was in complete denial about that even when all my friends were telling me that. Now that I'm better I don't think enduring all the pain was worth it and I don't even want to smoke again.

2022-02-23 20:18:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/szxskt/high_functioning_stoner_wanting_to_quit_weed/,High functioning stoner wanting to quit weed,"I want to preface my post that I don't want to appear as humble bragging about anything because it seriously affects my ability to reason with myself.

I am 25M and I have been a heavy stoner for the past 5-6 years of my life. Smoking multiple times a day, gbongs, severe dosages of edibles.

However, despite all that, my life is going well. I just got married last year - I am achieving all my goals (both in school and now at work). I am working my dream job and also am starting to pick up hobbies that I previously never could afford (e.g. piano). Being high rarely affected my ability to function in most aspects of my life, no matter how stoned I got.

Example of my days back in college. I would wake up at 5am, go to the gym, eat breakfast and then work in the library to finish all homework and projects well ahead of time. That way, by the time my suite mates woke up by noon/1pm, I would religiously smoke non-stop with or without them until 9-10pm when I went to bed. I ended up graduating with a 4.0 GPA

As a young adult, I go to the gym regularly (5-6 times a week). I put in a lot of hours at work and make my impact. I am on top of my finances and chores. I got a husky and love it to death. My wife and I are very happy together. BUT I am still smoking essentially every day (multiple joints starting at like 4-5pm until I sleep). My tolerance is unacceptably high and I try to t-break every so often to lower it. Most of the time when I smoke, it isn't even that fun, it just puts me in a sloth state while I play video games with friends on discord or mindlessly browse YouTube/reddit.

Like most people's experience, I have struggled severely on quitting vs moderating (I am just completely unable to moderate). I have had multiple sobriety streaks (personal record is \~80 days) of quitting.

However, I never felt any better mentally even after quitting. My behavior and day to day was essentially the same even when I am months without weed. I already feel very motivated in chasing and achieving my goals.

Because of all of the above, my mind takes control of me and makes me keep smoking because I keep reasoning to myself ""well what's the harm. (besides medically) I always get everything done including hobbies"", which keeps me in this endless loop of smoking.

I even gave weed to my wife to hold on for me (she doesn't smoke), and I find myself begging her to give me some when night time comes, which clearly is showing my addictive nature.

The biggest cons that I can list with weed is the following for myself:

1. Medical reasons (ignoring the specifics, it is clearly better for you if you don't smoke vs if you do)
2. I could be doing more hobbies (e.g. more book reading) instead
3. I don't want to feel dependent on weed to enjoy simple things like watching a movie with my wife, and it makes me feel guilty that I am high so much in her presence.

I would really love to hear other people's perspective on this because my mind is trying to convince me still of the moderation myth even though that NEVER works in practice with me.",16

Longer, in fact, if you count when I first started 15 years ago right out of high school. Anyway, a couple nights ago, my wife and I decided enough is enough. It costs too much (approximately $300 a month, even after cutting back) and the “positive” effects, if any, are negligible... I honestly can’t even remember the last time that smoking made me feel better. However, things really started to take a nosedive recently, when my (undiagnosed) depression/anxiety started to rear it’s head over the past few months… Long story, but basically just issues with my new boss. I’d come home after work and smoke like always, but instead of calming down, I’d begin to shake all over and feel on the verge of a total mental breakdown. My poor wife would have to basically spend all night consoling me. It really started to take its toll on my mental/physical health, and I suspect even my marriage.

I’m not blaming smoking for my anxiety attacks, as I’ve never handled stress well, but it certainly exacerbated things in my delicate state, and I feel like such an idiot for taking this long to realize that. I used to be too afraid to quit, simply because I had convinced myself that smoking was helping me in some way. Now I realize that quitting is the best thing I can do for myself. Smoking robbed me of my drive and motivation to challenge myself or accomplish… basically anything. How on earth did i ever think this drug was helping me? 

The withdrawals are difficult. Probably the worst of it is the liquid diarrhea. I can’t even trust a fart right now. My stomach has always given me trouble though. Probably another reason why I was too scared to quit before. Sleep has been tough these past two days too… Getting to sleep is easier, but staying asleep is another story. I’m not deterred though. In fact, I’m more determined than ever. I never want to go through this again.

I’m sorry that I don’t have much advice or encouragement to give. Seeing people update weeks or months into their journey to improve themselves has helped me immensely though, and I fully intend to do the same. One thing I can say is, if you’re like me and quit while you still had a good bit left, do yourself a favor and flush it.",7

The cravings right after quitting and especially at 3 months sober are **NOTHING** compared to after I get a sweet taste of that familiar mind-numbing high, when I'm not completely sick of it!

Thinking I could handle ""just one night"" or moderation has kept me high for several extra years. So much life wasted. So many skills I could have built, people I would have met, opportunities I should have created. Non-existent, because several times I was *truly fucking convinced* that I could get high for ""just one night"". Sobriety is so beautiful, I know better now, right? NO. I. Am. An. Addict. 

Our addiction is as valid and as serious as any other. We fight damn hard for a life worth living. There's plenty of misconceptions and ignorance about this addiction, so please don't let that get you down. We all see you here. We get it. For many of us this is one of the toughest things we'll ever have to overcome, but that means it will also be one of the most fulfilling.

I'd love to say I'm feeling amazing, but that isn't completely true. Like many of you, I've had very bad insomnia, night sweats and depression at times. My diet has been lacking the usual hunger in my belly on most days & I have to force myself to eat at times. It is very hard mentally to feel like I made the right choice sometimes when I'm hurting substantially. 

One thing stands out the most for me and it started yesterday. After a fight the previous night with my girlfriend due to me being distant and quiet, I sat down and thought a lot about life. Not my past, but my future. The greatest gift of not being high anymore is my ability to think CLEARLY. Finally, when I consider things in my future I don't feel completely negative about them. 

A lot of people say they want their old self back, which is a great thing. I don't want my old self back at all. What I want is something better for my new self. I've handled things in my past poorly and being clean has become my chance at redeeming greater prizes in life. Having an addictive personality brought me shame before, but now it brings me strength. I know I can't have life both ways. There is no way I can smoke socially and be the person I intend to be.

This is hard. Moments of doubt happen in different ways all the time. But once I broke through the wall of fog in my brain I realized that doubt is nothing to be ashamed of. I'm using my negative thoughts to push me towards more positive ones. My past no longer feels like time I've wasted away getting high & making mistakes. My past now feels like one big lesson on how I'm supposed to live for the entire future. So even if I'm not always feeling amazing right now, I'm on the correct path for myself to get there.

Thank you all very much for being a part of that. I'm proud of you all no matter what.",42

2022-02-23 15:22:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/szqy9e/chemical_induced_depression/,Chemical induced depression?,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health for all my life(ADHD and depression) in which last year I underwent TMS which relieved my symptoms and helped me build my life back. I was severely addicted(yes literal addiction) to weed in which I was smoking 10+ bowls a day, I dropped out of college because I failed all my classes, socially isolated myself, and considered suicide all while being high. I couldn’t stop, and even considered rehab.

After the TMS treatment I still smoked daily but was able to live in balance with it, only smoking once or twice a day. I hit the gym daily, dieted, felt motivated. Fast forward to a few months ago and I noticed a decrease in all of the aforementioned, and I begun slipping and slipping and slipping back into old habits. I’ve tried to desperately kick the weed but it’s difficult. Im angry, sad, depressed, it induces so much anger in me. I feel like im slowly slipping and my usage has gone back up. I tend to binge eat which causes my depression to amplify, and my anger to come full blown out while also socially isolating myself. 

My question is, has there been any real research on the relationship between chemical induced depression and weed? I know I’m not the only one that feels trapped like this. Will I always permanently feel like this? Or is this the weed effecting me and or killing my motivation so that I can no longer manage my depression like I once was? 

I hate that weed effects me like this. My dream has/is to be a master grower in the industry, and I still want to pursue this dream sober. I know it sounds like antithesis to my current predicament but I know I can live in balance with this substance I just need to take the first steps in quitting. Its just difficult.",3

I've been struggling to find my 'spirit voice' in this journey into quitting.. but I turned to music as my salvation again as I've often done in the darkest times of my life.

For the first time since quitting I decided to listen to the (simply incredible) album ""All Things Must Pass"" by George Harrison of the Beatles. When the song 'Wah Wah' came on,  the lyrics and melody made me immediately erupt into tears of joy.

You see, 'Wah Wah' is the first song George wrote after quitting the Beatles. And yet it's no sad or mournful song - instead it is an outrageously jubilant, joyful, defiant, freedom song.  George didn't need The Beatles to define him, and I don't need weed to define me. We are both happier and freer without the things chaining us down and this song captures it perfectly.

The lyrics and melody are so powerful in helping me cope with what I'm going through right now.  I pasted the lyrics below in case this song can help anyone else;  replace the phrase 'wah wah' with the thing we're trying to leave and you get the idea.

Let's celebrate our new freedoms. We don't need no wah wah.



[Verse 1]

Wah-wah

You've given me a wah-wah

And I'm thinking of you

And all the things that we used to do

Wah-wah, wah-wah



[Verse 2]

Wah-wah

You made me such a big star

Being there at the right time

Cheaper than a dime

Wah-wah, you've given me your wah-wah, wah-wah


[Bridge]

Oh, you don't see me crying

Oh, you don't hear me sighing



[Verse 3]

Wah-wah

I don't need no wah-wah

And I know how sweet life can be

If I keep myself free

Wah-wah

I don't need no wah-wah",2

 Is it reasonable to get high through edibles or vaping ?

Cause i really find it unfair that i cant enjoy it when i want. And in my thinking nicotine is the reason for that, cause it is so fking addicting.

Yesterday was rough, but I find I am having an easier time purging these feelings than I ever did while I was smoking. They are intense but don’t last nearly as long as they did when I was pushing these feelings away. 
My dreams are insane also… and sort of dark. It’s the best part of my day lol. 

Long story short, I dreamt about being at a party with elementary friends. The party moved to the porch and there were cocoons with small animals inside them… one of them burst and a gopher started attacking me!!! I grabbed a broom and that is when it got dark lol. The gopher turned into a man I’ve never met before and I beat him to a pulp.. my friends and I went back inside and gave him the middle finger. Maybe he’s my addiction?? I don’t know but getting that anger out felt so good. if anyone else wants to share crazy dreams they’ve had them because I love hearing about them!",9

I’m usually toking up right before bedtime.

This morning I feel anxious, and like something is missing. I got up early like normal so I can wake and bake, but fought back the urge. Now I’m at work and feel good not to have any mind haze (I don’t stay high for long, usually dissipates by the time I get to work or shortly there after)

Yesterday my kids were excited about tutu Tuesday, but I was too stressed about work and wanting to smoke to pay attention… hopefully I will be able to tell them later that tutu Tuesday was the day I quit marijuana.

I think this is the first time in 15 years that I didn’t smoke first thing in the morning… I guess that’s a good first step.",14

I hang out with my friend who smokes daily and I have not succumbed to the devils lettuce. And i do not plan to.

1. Tell yourself no every time you try and justify smoking just this one  time. Do it verbally  out  loud if you need to. Hell, even scream NOOOO if it helps.
2. Constantly reinforce yourself with positivity about why you quit and how much  better life is/can be without it. Feels way better than when I smoked and  would imagine  how better my  life would be without it. 
3. Start hitting the gym and replace your weed habit with a gym habit. I am now  practically addicted to hitting the gym and immediately have the urge to go when i wake up every morning. Getting  some dopamine from working out feels way better than a 30 minute  weed high. 
4. Gaming is better with a sober mind, as is working since  you are not  constantly thinking about your post  work bong  rip after getting off for the night. 
5. Think about how much healthier your lungs are/will be without smoking pot everyday  and  filling up your lungs with weed tar.
6. If you  cant sleep at night or have  trouble  doing  it without pot, maybe look into  taking  meltonin. Its sold at your loal pharmacy and is drug free/not habit  forming. Ive  found it  to help tremendously.
7. Your appetite will come back eventually and eating is  so much better when you're not  stoned  all the time, believe  it  or not. You will eat healthier too  and  your body, again, will thank you for that. I had trouble with my stomach for the first few weeks off the  weed and had trouble pooping. Now, Ive been eating  well and  my poops have been so much more healthy than when  i was smerking.
8. Your memory and  attention to detail will improve. As someone diagnosed with ADHD, my attention span has improved tremendously with a much more clear mind. 
9. You will have much more energy during the day  and wont feel the mid day  grogginess that smoking weed,  especially waking and baking, leads to. 

Feel free to add your own thoughts,  tips, and things one can look  forward  to:

I got into another relationship, she cheated on me long distance. I got into a car wreck a month after I bought my first car with my own money at 25. I had a pregnancy scare with some girl from tinder, she stalked me. I missed my best friends wedding as his best man in Jamaica . I moved 5 times all on my own, 3 states, and kept trying to find some kind of purpose.. lost most of my life’s saving to the only thing that I could find consistentcy in, weed. It’s crazy to look back on what has happened. Now I own a small business, I don’t play video games 10 hours a day, I quit smoking altogether and haven’t looked back. I used to dream to sleep! Now I sleep to dream! I have so much energy, I have my fucking confidence back, started lifting , went on 3 dates in the last month and crushed it. Look forward to every single day. I got a studio mic and some recording equipment in my new apartment… never lived on my own before until now! Going to start making music and reinvent myself! It’s like my whole being was suppressed and numbed for so long I was content with all the shit that was havppening in my life. I can go into huge detail about my story in order but I’ll just say, this was the hardest time of my life. Things do and will get better for each and every one of us! Believe and keep faith.

I've attended MA meetings, tried everything from tossing everything out, not hanging out with people etc. I couldn't do it.

A few months back, I decided to only have an edible in the evenings to help with sleep. That was a huge shift since I've been smoking all day everyday for so many years. I felt good. A few weeks later, I was back on my bullshit and I was appalled at how much money I was spending. How did my tolerance go UP after a slight break? I've also been unemployed for a long time now so I feel even more like a shit head.

So I decided to create a plan - it needed to be written down and referenced frequently. I created a table (edited generic for slight anonymity). This has helped me because now I look forward to the reward. My therapist suggested that rather starting back at 0, to delay the next reward the number of days that I relapsed. 

Sharing this in hopes it helps someone thats struggling to stay on the wagon.

Hello! This is my first time posting on this sub, so apologies if I’m a bit rambly or miss any of the rules. 

I’m coming up on 1yr of sobriety from drinking (March 28), and 20days since I’ve given up weed (it would be 52 but I relapsed on the 4th with an edible). I also am some years out (exact unknown, but approximately 3) since abuse of prescribed meds that I took for about 13years. 

Last year about this time, I experienced some no-good things including a sexual assault that I’m now in the process of reporting, a loss of my cousin to complications of depression and addiction, and I called a crisis center on March 29 (the day after my last drink) and was hospitalized for the second time with a manic episode later that week. 

Last year also at this time, I made friendships with a couple women who I respect and admire, and our friendship was a deep dive due to the pandemic. While the warm months are spent backpacking each weekend/extended trips, I began to spend more time with them last fall and our time was spent smoking many a joint and conversing over yoga and dinner. 

They are aware of my sobriety pursuits, as well as the reasons why and the hard moments that’ve propelled me here. Last weekend, we all spent time at a cabin 3hrs away (I drove separately). Prior to us leaving, I asked that they smoke outside as “sobriety is challenging for me right now because of reasons XYZ”. They overwhelmingly agreed, but when I arrived I basically walked into a wall of smoke, and one was also day drinking all weekend. These friends are smokers like I used to smoke, but more: from dawn to dusk, j’s rolled all day then bowls packed at night.

Being the only sober one in any setting sucks, and I anticipated that the full weekend would be hard because it’s not like a social evening of where I can leave. The weekend was mostly okay as I brought things to keep my dog and myself outside, but I was hurt and disappointed at how unheard I was. 

I sent a text to ask for a bit of space that I framed in a non-blaming way expressing this once I was home, but I’m wondering what the best way to proceed is. I’m hoping to move into a casual friendship, but I also don’t know if it’s even worth salvaging. Cue Chance the Rapper’s “Same Drugs.”

Appreciate your wisdoms. Your stories have given me so much solidarity and agency in this necessary but so often painful journey.",1

2022-02-23 02:01:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/szb2kr/emotions_and_energy_after_no_smoking/,Emotions and Energy after no smoking,"Hi Everyone

So I am currently on a 11 day sober streak, probably the longest in a long time, mainly because I threw away everything 11 days ago. Now I have a question about energy levels and emotions.

Is it normal to feel very tired for a while after not smoking anymore? My main reason for stopping was I started suffering from bad bakeovers and brain fog resulting in my work ethic taking a nose dive. This resulted in many emotional breakdowns about how I am not who I use to be and how I'm just a disappointment to myself. Yes this is a very hectic one that not all people have, but sadly becoming a heavy smoker resulted in a drastic lifestyle and personality change over time.

Will this tiredness eventually clear up and will my body start feeling more energized? Or could it be something else causing me issues.

Edit: In the past 11 days I have started feeling more productive at work and brain has been feeling more clear, its just the energy levels I'm still waiting to return. Overall my mental health has been improving, with some small emotional dips here and there, but over all even over this small amount of time things have been feeling a lot better and I slowly feel like I'm returning to pre stoner self.

Thanks again for any responses.",6

I've been smoking daily for about 10 years. My girlfriend and all my friends are daily smokers.

I used to struggle to find friends when I was younger, but once I started smoking weed I started to meet new people.

Eventually I started getting a bit of extra weed just so that I could split it with my friends and save us all money. This led to me always being the one to get it and split it, which led to me suddenly having a lot more ""friends"". I never planned to be a dealer, it just happened. I started getting invited to more parties and things just because I was the guy with weed. Naturally I embraced this as I felt popular and wanted.

Fast forward many many years to now, and pretty much everyone I know is a smoker, and they all get it through me. I don't know who's really my friend any more, I feel like the only value I have to people is that they can get what they need from me.

I feel like years have vanished and I don't remember shit, I haven't achieved much, I have countless unfinished projects and abandoned dreams, I don't care about my career, I'm always lazy and tired, I get depressed and lonely.

Every time I talk to my gf or friends about quitting they act like I'm crazy and that I shouldn't. I think most of them just don't want to lose their source.

If I quit I will lose my identity and value to the people around.. I imagine they will all just fade away.

If I just get high again I won't care anymore.. I'll just keep existing, doing what I do.

So I have been clean for just over a month after chronically using for 4 years almost daily(Started at 17 using occasionally, until 21 almost daily).I would spend all day being high without a worry in the world, sometimes taking breaks due to it increasing my anxiety rather than helping. I didnt start using it to try to treat the anxiety, I just generally enjoyed the feeling of it and had a friend group that encouraged it. Anyways, I stopped due to not being productive and I wasnt going to just sit there and accept that (I was practically okay with being bored while high). While being high, I was really social, could hold conversations, and problem solve easier. But with being clean for almost a month, Ive had this feeling in my head that I just cant shake, it feels like my mental clarity is just gone. I have trouble talking to people without making it weird because I wouldn’t know what to say, not knowing or even attempting to answer questions for class when a teacher calls upon me, even with a hobby of mine, making music. I have trouble coming up with lyrics for a song. All of this was non existent when I was smoking but since ive stopped, I feel that my brain isn’t functioning properly and Im worried that ive completely ruined my brain since it still considered to be developing until 25. Is it possible for me to gain my mental clarity back? Am I screwed?

Before Xmas, I sold my house and moved, because my entire social life revolved around weed in my home town.  But my habit moved with me.  I smoked less but still several times daily.  Turns out getting a plug in the new town was easier than making new friends and quitting!

So I packed my bags again and decided to take a 3 week trip to the USA and Mexico.  I can get weed pretty easy here in the states, but I find it a bit intimidating and as a solo female traveler, I don't want to be high in unfamiliar places.  That's enough to keep me out of the dispensaries.

I go home in 10 days though and I'm already thinking about smoking.  I am super proud of myself for making this trip and for taking the withdrawals in my stride but I just can't help thinking I am gonna cave as soon as I get home.  I am actually thinking of extending the trip just to keep me away from it a few weeks longer but obviously I can't keep doing that forever!

Anyone have any advice, or done something similar?  How did you resist when it was right there under your nose again?",6

suffering b/c stress? weed. suffering b/c grief over the death of a friend? weed. suffering b/c things were good and then they changed? weed. suffering b/c life is suffering sometimes? weed. every tiny kernel of negative feelings had me reaching for my pipe, my joint. being bipolar meant my mania was worse, my depression was worse, and the neutral mood was numb.

when i quit on january 1, 2022 it was after nearly 2.5 years of chronic use, and intermittent adolescent use prior to that. when i first quit, all the feelings, all the hurt, all the grief, all the regret came flooding back. at the end of the day, if you are still using weed, there is nothing you can hide from yourself. your mind is YOURS. you cannot tuck something away during a high stupor, without it coming back in a boomerang sometime in the future. it’s the law of cause and effect, what goes up will come down, what seeds i planted in my mind grew up into massive weeds (pun not intended.) 

can i claim that life is 100% better and i do not experience suffering anymore? no! life is still hard, and i still struggle. however, i feel that little light back within me: i can go outside and marvel at little weird things i see, without having smoked a joint prior. i notice clouds, leaves, trees, birds, and colorful pieces of trash. i feel shocked when i see them sometimes, because they are so beautiful. i let myself cry, dance, write, meditate, sleep, rest, and create! i let it all pour of out me, because i feel that 2 month mark return of my own inner magic (my own naturally produced cannabanoids). 

remember: you have naturally produced quantities of cannabinoids! you can stimulate them by looking at something that fills you with wonder, by going outside to a wild space, by going on a little adventure to your favorite place, by doing something creative, by eating a really beautiful & tasty meal, by running around a big field until you have to stop to catch your breath. 

my precious friends, i hope you are all well reading this!!! i am sending you unlimited strength towards your goals, for they are ambitious and worthy! i am sending you love, for you are precious & deserving of care! i am sending you courage, to hold to your agreements with yourself from a place of love! i am sending you peace, to rest & recover, to be calm without being numb.",10

2022-02-22 17:38:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sz0n1n/went_to_my_first_concert_sober_and_it_was_amazing/,Went to my first concert sober and it was amazing: My advice,"The concert was one of the best experiences of my life. Seriously, the entire time I was so happy.  I was so used to getting high and dissociating the whole concert, not even mentally there. However this concert, I was present the whole time. Not thinking about any of my stressors or anxiety. I even made another sober friend. **I wasn't tempted at all during the event, not a single thought about how** ***""weed would make this better""*****. Because guess what? I knew it wouldn't :D**

So here's my advice:

For anyone struggling trust me, it gets better. **Find the things in your life that are holding you back from being sober.**  Whether it be an enabling roommate, a significant other who stresses you out/enables you, stress from lack of boundaries with parents, or just any of the other sh#t life throws at you. **Find a way to fix it or get rid of it.** Get rid of everything that does not serve you.

You may have to do some trial and error, but don't be so hard on yourself. There's no such thing as failure, only lessons.

That being said, **getting sober will require you to be selfish**. **It will require you to prioritize yourself and your own needs.** So there may be some friends you may not be able to hang out with anymore because they always enable you and aren't helping you be the best you. If you're a college-aged guy like me, it may mean skipping a party. **Focus on you and your future.** You aren't going to find deep meaningful relationships in a room full of potheads/drunks anyway. In time, **You will find better friends who truly want the best for you.**

Finally, the best advice I can give is: **Go to NA/AA**

I know some of y'all might find it cringe but trust me the groups have so much to offer. One of the mottos of the groups are: **Find the similarities, not the differences.** Everyone in the groups share the same common problem, their brain cannot responsibly consume substances. You don't even have to follow the 12 steps, just go there and gain the knowledge they have to offer.

**It's nice to have a community of people dealing with the same problem as you.** **As well as having people who have years of experience with this problem and have conquered it.**

One final note:

Always recognize that you are trying your best and appreciate your efforts. **And listen, I know this is a lonely journey but I am proud of you.**

**You're doing great :)**",9

(NSFW maybe?)

&#x200B;

I have a problem with weed.

&#x200B;

For context: Began smoking when I was 17/18. Started off once a week then quickly developed into a daily habit. At the time I had a gf and was on track to finish HS on time. Once smoking became a daily habit of mine, I lost interest in school and just attending in general. That turned into me not completing it on time, which I became very depressed over. Thought my life was over. (also, friends went away to college and I was still at home, never really reconnected)

Continued smoking, started working and taking evening classes to obtain outstanding credits (but I hadn't dealt with the depression). Slowly everything lost meaning, I didn't care for anyone or anything, distanced myself from my friends, family and my girlfriend. Basically only used her for sex. (sound like an AH, I know) This lasted for 2 years.

Than got accepted to college to begin in the Fall. The summer prior I had stopped smoking weed, with my gf's help (she never smoked). Life was looking up finally. Gf went on vacation to her home country to visit her relatives and I had 2 weeks to myself. Got the idea that maybe ill smoke just today, that I'm stronger than my urge to smoke habitually. Nope. Gf came back, noticed I had gone back to old habits and left me.

Started school but lost the desire to attend and stopped going. At that point I was devastated over the relationship ending, being two years behind everyone, and was smoking solely to get some reprieve from the feeling of what a failure I had once again become.

This is becoming pretty long. Ill summarize. From 20-23 worked, did not attend school. No friends, no desire for a gf. Isolated myself and smoked. Got some help for my depression at 23 and stopped smoking. (was in therapy and on prescription medication)  Great! I thought. Smoked a few months after because I once again convinced myself I was stronger. Stopped going to therapy and taking prescription medication. Became what I loathed. Again. But I had started school again, almost finished too with only 3 credits remaining for an advanced diploma (Canada) But was smoking, barely passing. Stopped going. Kept working till 26 and had gotten a decent job but drug tests were required. Great! Just the kick in the pants I needed. Stopped smoking for 4 months but noticed that tests were only required to get employed, no random ones. Started smoking again. Still no friends, no education past HS, no gf. Worst day of my life was my 27th birthday when it was as if I had finally opened my eyes to what I had become. Very depressed and saw no point in continuing. (don't think i need to spell out my intention or what i had planned)

I'm now two weeks away from my 28th birthday. I wake up dreading everyday. No job. (been lying for months that Im 'working from home') No school. Still at home with my parents. (worst part, my parents want to help me buy a house rn, but I have no papers to prove my employment, shit credit, not much money) No friends. No special someone. Still haven't gotten over my first. And I look back at all the opportunities I had to make a change, an honest effort to make something of myself, and I am ashamed. I feel like a bitch everyday.

&#x200B;

I want to quit, everyday, every hour. I've wanted to since I was 20. But after so many years, being so depressed because of all the chances I had to change and letting them slip by, I don't know what to tell myself to keep going. To strive for something better. If I do try to restart my life, ill have to redo some HS credits to get accepted to uni, wont be till I'm 32/33 till I finish. Will be 10 years behind everyone I know. Plus with all my burned bridges I cant get a job that pays more than $20 an hour rn (its not much here) which makes everything I want to do more difficult to attain. I am nothing and have nothing. After 7 fucking years of self destructing myself and watching it go by.  But now I went back to therapy and taking prescription medication. but still ruminating all day. Doc says I'm speaking too much in absolutes. Idk?

&#x200B;

That's enough bitching for one day.

\*  I don't blame weed. At all. It has only made my ungraceful descent easier. I just don't know what to tell myself.

During the anxious times my body feels like it’s on fire, especially in my arms, neck and chest muscles around my collarbone, and my brain feels like it’s squeezing itself or something. 

I don’t have any cravings but sometimes I wanna have a toke just to see if it will help my anxiety and suicidal ideation for a bit but I also have a feeling it may do the opposite… 

When it becomes time to sleep I almost smile knowing I will have at least many hours of “peace” before it all starts again.

I've been smoking heavily for 10 years, 1st thing on a morning and last thing at night and literally non stop on a weekend. I could sit and smoke zoot after zoot so easily

I've tried to quit countless times but failed every time

I was wondering if people found it easier to quit when smoking once a day, late evening once all your shit is done, or quite cold turkey

I am currently cold turkey on day 2 but all I can think about is how I would love a smoke to wind down after my 11 hour shift

I'm not sure if it's due to my heavy use I am wanting to smoke soooo badly

If I smoked only once a night for a week, would it then be easier to go cold turkey as my thc levels will be on average lower?

Not sure if anyone has experience with this, everyone on this sub seems to think tapering is really bad and literally the only way is cold turkey

I have been a daily cannabis user for around 2 years. It started as a fun thing for me on occasion. I'm a full time artist and I liked that it made me feel more creative and productive at times. Then the pandemic hit and it very quickly became something I did to essentially escape reality. The thing is, I wasn't a smoker because it hurt my lungs so bad every time I tried. Instead, I ate edibles every day. And they can be so potent. My moods got worse, and I stopped feeling productive and creative and instead would basically pass out in the middle of the day after eating an edible at noon no matter what ""strain"" it was. I also gained a ton of weight from how much I would eat. I convinced myself I was healing myself by not caring about what my body looked like and therefore improving my body image. What I realize now is that I was actually just worsening my ED. My mind would get bored so easily that I would scare myself with intrusive thoughts that really hurt my relationship with my long time partner. My finances suffered greatly because I wasn't getting as much work finished. 
This all changed about 5 days ago. My partner and I tried another drug together and had a very positive experience together and afterwards we both came to the conclusion that we should quit weed.
Anyway, all of that to say that I am on day 5 now. The first few days weren't actually so bad but since yesterday I have this insane pressure in my head, headaches, and the worst fatigue I've ever had. The positive though, is that I haven't had the desire to binge eat or eat any bad food in general this entire week. All I've wanted is salads.

Figured I would share a snap shot of my story as I am trying to build a bridge and get over weed.

Recently I have found myself in a deep depression as I have been alone starting a job in a new city. Weed and getting stoned has been a coping mechanism for me for a long time but I have come to recognize that it has been at the center of and has clouded an underlying depression that I have had ever since I can remember. The change in perspective it gives offered an enjoyable change in how I viewed the good and bad in the world and in myself. The ability to distance myself from my own views and think outside of myself helped as much as hurt me growing up. I discovered weed with friends that I played sports with and I immensely loved the mental physical state I found when challenging myself physically when stoned. I have smoked weed consistently for over 12 years with periods of sobriety but have stayed consistent over that time. 

Now that I am nearing my 29th birthday and am alone as I have ever been, I have come to grips that I need to kick this habit as it servers me no good and pulls me deeper down into the pit of my own despair where nothing seems interesting anymore and I am cynical of everything including myself. The biggest void to fill is the ability to stay focused and content with everyday existence and to not have a sense of dread about the mundane while finding interest in life again. I also would like to find myself able to go to the gym without feeling like I need to be stoned to find that sense of enjoying the physical challenge. I like the sense of over coming challenges and overcoming this dependence on weed is what I am focused on.

Any words of advice or support are greatly appreciative. Thank you.",7

 At age 33, after a couple of failed earlier attempts I decided to quit my 2 decades of smoking weed (basicly) everyday. I was doing really well and at the beginning of this year I hit my 1.5 year mark.

I figured I could smoke one join during new years eve because I was doing so well. It escalated over the following weeks and ended in a full month of hardcore weedsmoking.

Im sober again now for 3days.

No big deal. It is a shame that I ruined my 1.5 streak but other than that it gave me a lot of refreshing insights.

It confirmed to me that I really have cannabis issues and that abstinence is the only way to go for me.

But it also made me realize how much I achieved during these 1.5 years and how much better I feel about myself now.

For the first time in a loooong long time I can say thay I am proud of myself. I learned that I can be abstinent and I am looking forward to all my achievements in the upcoming 1.5 years.

Remember guys! A slip up in abstinence is not the end of the world! It's a learning moment on how to do even better the next time!

2022-02-22 13:54:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/syv7ut/420_days/,420 Days,"Today marks 420 days weed free.

I'm 36 years old. I first smoked when I was 13. I started smoking regularly by 15. By 18 I was a full blown pothead, smoking all day everyday.

I had a one ounce per month habit, but I didn't make enough money to support it. I stole from my mom. I stole from my sister. I sold prized possessions. I was a regular at the CoinStar machine.

Eventually, I made enough to support my habit. Every event was an occasion to smoke. Waking up, going to bed, before eating, after eating, watching TV, leaving the house, coming home, and so on.

But something changed in 2020. I started smoking only at night to conserve my stash. Then I found myself skipping nights. Then I found myself going weeks without smoking. Finally, on 12/28/2020, I smoked a joint with my cousin and realized that I just don't like being high anymore. I knew that from that point on, I'd never smoke again. And I haven't.

My mom had a similar experience with weed. She smoked like a chimney for 20 years, but in her 30's she just lost her taste for it.

My dad, my brothers, my uncle's, my cousins, and my friends smoke. They smoke around me. But I haven't had the slightest urge (although I do miss the social aspect of going outside and joining the circle). I still enjoy the smell of fresh herbs, but the smell of burnt weed is repulsive.

I said in a previous post that I don't feel as though I ""quit"" smoking weed. Quitting requires tremendous effort (I tried a handful of times). Instead, I feel as though I ""finished"" smoking weed. I'm done. And 12/28 is now a personal holiday: ""Finishing Day"".

Today marks 1 year since my ex moved out. We broke up because I was a shitty bf due to my addiction.

At the time, I wasn't sure my visa would be renewed since I dropped out of college a year before that, and I didn't tell my family or friends, she and 2 other friends of mine were the only people who knew. I was working full time even though that was against my visa, but I didn't know what else to do.

Not telling people my problems led me down a dark lonely path, where I couldn't scream for help.

Once I told more of my friends about my situation, I felt a great relief, they helped me as much as they could, I still couldn't tell my family though.

I lived alone for 3 months and I actually was able to quit for one month during the lockdown. Then I got my wisdom teeth out and relapsed to help with the pain. Those 3 months where some of the shittiest I've ever felt! I just smoked, went to work, came back and numbed myself to sleep! I went on a couple tinder dates to distract myself but I was still miserable.

Then I moved to a shared apartment in the middle of town, because I needed people around me but the apartment was horrible. I didn't want to be alone with my thoughts at any moment! I just went to work, forgot about dating, and just smoked all day every day as long as I wasn't at work.

Last November, my visa situation caught up to me and I lost my job on the spot! I was devastated. It was the only thing I had going on for me and I was just gone. The only person I felt I needed then was my ex, and she was there to console me.

Then for about 6 weeks, real depression kicked in. I didn't know anything anymore. I had no porpuse, no where to go, no one to really confy to. It physically hurts me to even think about it. 

Then I decided it was time to get my life together and tossed out everything I had! A few days later my brother came to check on me. He knew I wasn't doing well even though I was trying to hide it. He pretty much rescued me!! He helped me stay clean, i reapplied to school and got in! He helped me sort out everything with my parents, and I got my visa sorted out, and moved into a mich better apartment. I even got to go to my sister's wedding and see my whole family again.

My bottled up emotions came out but I was able to channel them into a positive energy and keep pushing. I had a lot of things to process and to forgive myself for. Except for one major one. 

When my ex broke up with me, I didn't really process it in a healthy way, I just got high and thought I was over her a few months later. We still kept in touch and we were friends. Then I got caught up with fixing my life and had a lot of distractions. I asked her if we could work things out and she said no. I was still OK with it and was moving on, and stayed clean, but I could never forgive myself for how toxic I was to her.  

I came back from visiting my family 3 weeks ago, and I didn't really think about her much. Until I saw that she is dating again. I will admit I relapsed, for a whole week, last night I had a dream about her and I woke up in tears. 

I know I will get past this, this is me facing the storm I knew was coming eventually. 

What I learned so far is that, not reaching out is very self destructive, and that what goes around, DOES come back around, and when it does.... It hurts!! 

I also learned that the worst thing you could do to yourself is give up. Keep trying and keep pushing and don't ever give up! It will only lead to you hating yourself and not giving yourself the opportunity you deserve! 

Despite everything, I am truly blessed to have gone through this, I needed it to open my eyes, and my heart. Thanks to whoever read this.",3

It took me years to fully go no contact and get away and I was completely floored with just how badly it effected me. At the time smoking helped for a myriad of reasons but I’m now 10 years deep in my habit and i haven’t had a single fully sober day in my adult life. Not just daily but quite often hourly, like clockwork, I’ll light up. I go out of my way to make sure I don’t run out of materials, have multiple dealers on standby in case my main guy isn’t around and spend an embarrassing amount of time and money on smoking. I feel stunted developmentally, miles behind my peers and trapped by a situation of my own creation. The abuse wasn’t my fault, but developing such a compulsive coping mechanism was and is. 

I’ve managed to get my consumption down to a half oz a month which is better than it’s been in years - today I smoked in the morning but nothing else, I’ve so far managed 7 hours. My head hurts. I ate a big meal earlier for when my appetite inevitably shits out later. I am absolutely terrified to be left alone with my thoughts when I try going to bed tonight and even more afraid of my subconscious ones - my experiences with trying to quit in the past have always been punctuated by horrible nightmares that I wake up from drenched in sweat and sobbing. I wake up feeling as powerless and vulnerable as I did as a freshly traumatized kid and to put it simply if I smoke myself stupid I don’t dream, and I avoid the possibility of nightmares.

Now is probably the best time for me to make this move, I’ve done a Lot of work in therapy and am appropriately medicated, my best friend is quitting of his own volition rn too (we enable each other a lot) and im determined not to waste another year of my twenties baselessly stoned and unable to move forward. 

my perception and consciousness have been constantly altered through years that are developmentally important in becoming a rounded adult that understands oneself, and I sincerely don’t know who I am. don’t know what im like sober. Won’t know if I don’t try. 

Not sure what my aim is in writing this but the sense of kinship I’ve felt reading everybody’s posts has been really encouraging - you’re all doing amazing and I hope I can follow in your footsteps ❤️",10

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. I just want to get some inside into other people's experiences and see if some of you can relate to mine. 

I have smoked weed everyday for 2-3 years, minus vacations and small tolerance breaks. I usually only smoke at night after school or work and I only smoke 1-2 joints a day. 

So I quit smoking weed about a month ago. It have been wanting to quit for a long time, so even though I became irritable I had a lot of motivation to quit, so it wasn't too hard for me because I could feel my mental health deteriorating as I became way more tired, introverted and lazy from smoking everyday for that long.( I am usually an ambivert, which means I can be very extroverted when I am in a good mental state.) I became very irritated and had a hard time sleeping for the first 5 days but i still didn't want to smoke because I really want to feel good mentally and I knew I had to quit if wanted a good mental health. 

After the first week of quitting I felt a rush of energy and surplus I started eating healthy and joined the gym. I had the energy to clean my apartment very well and I felt encouraged to start doing good things for myself. 

But after 3 weeks my energy plummeted again and I started getting racing thoughts at night and during the day. And I started to realize just how much shit I had been blocking out mentally by smoking every night and making myself fall asleep and blocking out negative thoughts with the weed. 

I am now in a state where I feel the exact same as I did when I was smoking weed except for the fact that I know have to listen to my thoughts because I'm am not blocking them out anymore. I don't have the energy to eat healthy, clean my apartment or go to the gym. I have so many intrusive thoughts about my life, mostly bad things that have happened to me. I am not a severely traumatized person but we all have our bagage.

Now I can't stop thinking about if this has something to do with me smoking weed everyday for that long or if I am just a depressed person. 

I have been dealing with depression for 6-7 years of my life on and off but I have learned to live with it. I know now that I used weed as a way of self medicating and it actually worked for some time as it gave me a break from my intrusive thoughts and overly caring about unimportant stuff. So I could go to work or school without feeling impending doom. 

But after a while the weed just blocks you from doing the things you need to do to succeed in life, it made me confused and my memory also started to be affected by this. As well as not being able to connect with the world and people around me anymore. 

So what I am confused about now is the fact that after the first week I actually felt better, less confused, better memory, more energy. But after 3 weeks I feel the same again as if was still smoking weed everyday. 

Right now I am laying on the couch and I can't seem to find the energy to do anything. Has any of you experienced this? And could it be linked to the fact that i stopped smoking?",2
2022-02-22 09:23:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/syosy5/quitting_for_the_thousandth_time/,Quitting for the thousandth time,"So I‘ve been smoking a lot for ten years. 1 1/2 years ago, I really wanted to quit. A friend of mine and my dog died and I realised I just smoked nonstop after that. It worked for half a year. The last year I’ve been stuck in the circle of being smokefree for some time and than falling for the illusion I could manage my smoking. Just smoke a little bit from time to time. I‘ve proven I can stop, so why shouldn‘t I just smoke a bit?

I know it‘s bullshit. It only takes a few days and I‘m back where I was before I wanted to quit. My addiction voice is telling me this lies. I know that and still the voice wins everytime…

I‘m so tired of this shit. Through falling back again and again I always have to fight this shitty first days without sleep and all again and again. I don‘t tell my friends because I‘m ashamed of my failing. So I need to hide it and tell them lies and that just all feels so wrong. Something needs to change. I wanna manage being clean so badly. This topic is always present and I hate that smoking became more important to me compared to what really matters in my life.

I‘m struggling with depression since I‘ve been 12. Smoking always felt like giving my head a break from all this shitty, self destructive thoughts. I don’t think it has this positive effect anymore. It just makes my depression worse. But still, it‘s somehow saved as a cure in my stupid brain even though I know it‘s not true.

I‘m doing therapy. I‘m also visiting a support group for addiction and depression. And still… I feel like I‘ve organized my support in a good way and it‘s just not enough. Like I‘m just not strong enough.

I‘ll visit the group again this evening. Still have a bit left for a short smoke. I will use it for sleeping today and have my first clean day tomorrow.

I don‘t know what the purpose of this post is. Guess I‘m hoping that writing it down ‚in public‘ is helping somehow. 

To everyone who managed quitting: I‘m so proud of you. This is so hard and you made it. Your stories are inspiring for me.

To everyone who wants to quit: I feel you. You are not alone. We can fight this shit together!

It‘s my first reddit post and I‘m not a native speaker. Hope it‘s ok to read.",5

But the good news is, I have my dreams back. And while it's fun to remember your dreams, I realized today how important it is too. Our brains do so much processing while we sleep, detangling the day, sorting through things, making connections, repairs, etc. 

Last night I had a very vivid dream. The background: My parents were extremely verbally and physically abusive to me as a child. They thought it was ok because that's how they were raised, and it's ""part of our culture"". It slowly stopped as I grew older and began standing up for myself. My dad finally stopped beating me up when I, as a 16 year old girl, finally got fed up of being a punching bag a kicked him back in the stomach while he had me pinned down on a chair. He apologized that day and promised he'd never beat me again, and he didn't. It didn't erase the years of abuse, but I do respect him for seeing the error in his ways and sticking to his promise. My mother continued to slap me well into my late twenties and finally stopped when I drafted a long email detailing all the abuse, sent it to my immediate family, and told them the next time anyone raises a hand on me that email is getting sent to the entire extended family + friends. 

Last night I dreamed that they were screaming at me and threatening to beat the shit out of me like they did when I was a child, and I was standing my ground refusing to move even as they got closer, and screaming back ""I'm not scared of you anymore!"" Something similar has happened in my waking life too, and just like then, I was trembling head to toe while screaming I wasn't scared. I could even feel the trembling in my dream. 

And then my friend Zo walks in the door, grasps me gently by my arm and leads me out of the room and into another room, and just holds me. 

I woke up sobbing. I realized, somewhere in the back of my mind, that I was still putting so much energy into fighting with my parents and defending myself to them, when in fact I could just...walk out. I'm an adult now. Dream Zo showed me I could literally just leave that toxic situation and move into a better space. Which doesn't mean I'm going to cut my parents off completely, I know I'll never do that. But I don't have to waste any more energy on that whole shitshow of a past. 

So yeah, it's fun to remember your dreams, but it's important too. Dreams show us a lot of connections we may otherwise miss. I'm just happy to have that part of my brain back. Hoping my memory returns next :)

2022-02-22 09:02:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/syocdo/6_months_clean_today_after_smoking_daily_for_most/,"6 months clean today, after smoking daily for most of my life","This is a post that for 25 years, I didn't think I'd ever be able to write. I smoked all day, every day from the age of 17 to 42. It's sad to say, but smoking was my life. My identity. My reason for waking up in the morning and my reason for going to sleep in the evening. 

Everything revolved around my next joint. I planned my days around it. I didn't go on holidays where I wouldn't be able to smoke. I couldn't hang out with people that didn't know I smoked.

I had accepted that this was my life and this is how it would have to stay. I couldn't function without weed, I didn't remember how to survive without it.

Then, a series of unexpected events in my life forced me to re-evaluate everything. I finally admitted to myself that not only do I want more from my life, but I NEED more. 

Here I am, 6 months later, a different person. 
I made such a drastic change to my life in a way that I myself, didn't think was possible. 
The benefits of this change become more apparent to me every day.

I hope this motivates at least one person to make the leap. If right now you're not sure if you can do this, I can tell you that you can.
If someone who smoked like me can do it, anyone can.
Just make that decision. 

Good luck to everyone ❤",416
2022-02-22 08:54:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/syo5zp/1_week_clean_for_the_first_time_in_a_year_long/,1 week clean for the first time in a year (long post)," Hey everyone, hope you're enjoying this clear minded journey. I hit 1 week clean today, the longest I've been off for about about a year. And its been getting me thinking.

I stated smoking at about 15. And like most of us, I was escaping something. I know having a tough childhood is not uncommon, but I had a pretty weird one to say the least. Parents split up at 10, my mom remarried to my dads cousin (fucked, lol) and then my dad went through a second divorce. I spend a night in jail at 13, for ""hijacking"" and joyriding golf carts from within a golf estate (yeah... it was a bit of an extreme punishment).

I felt very lost and unloved by my family, and thought my friends were my only family as they were also battling with personal issues and we supposedly only had each other. Anyway, my friends (actually very bad influences) and I started experimenting around 15. We became stoners, making cross joints and skipping school, buying 20gs and seshing up constantly. Always high.

My grades were okay, but I am a relatively intelligent person (if I say so myself, lol) and I knew they could be better. But I would rather be high because I believed I gained some newfound next-level spiritual state of mind from it. Which to some degree could have a little bit of truth to it, but now that I'm clean I think it was just the haze.

It escalated to harder stuff, pills, powder, sometimes combined. Really overdid it. My dad took me out of the school my friends were in, we relocated cities and I ended up getting expelled from my new school, and taking an anxiety drug at the next school and blacking out, and finally quitting school altogether. Considering I literally used to get 1st in the grade for IT, not finishing my final year, well, was a huge waste of potential. I felt like it was stolen from me. By myself.

I wasted so many years of my life chasing highs. Scouring the carpet for just enough crumbs to hit my homemade vape bottle and tinfoil pipe. Like a fucking addict that couldn't control himself. I hated that I was like that, but I didn't care, as long as I got high.

I used to write a book. I even made a website to showcase it and got so many responses praising it, I was pretty decent. Creative. But I neglected that too and that creativity kinda slipped away. I was slowly losing myself, all the skills and qualities that made me me, were getting replaced by smoke.

I got my first job last year to try to gain some control. And what a blessing that was. But mostly a distraction from the fact that I couldn't go study. I stopped taking hard stuff, only party pills like twice a year, but still smoking all the time. Watching the clock at work waiting for 5pm so i could hit my bong in the car and go home and hide from my dad in my room when all he wanted to do was hang out. But I would rather be high alone.

I ended up doing A levels independently so I can go to uni, and I'm writing my final papers this year, at age 20. Better late than never, everyones' life moves differently.

My dad was away for the past two weeks, and I was smoking up like crazy. Neglecting studying yet again. As soon as he got back, I just had this feeling that I needed to bring back that first in the grade boy again. I cold turkeyed on the spot and haven't looked back. It's only been a week but I feel like I've gained so much control back, so much fear of getting caught by my dad is gone. I don't neglect spending time with him because I'd rather smoke anymore. I can actually control my life and emotions again. It feels magical.

Honestly, its been a rollercoaster and I've told myself quitting drugs and ditching those friends was enough. And I thought weed was whatever, my personal treat. But it started my downfall, and damn right it was the thing prolonging it too.

I'm staying clean for good now, and I'm so proud of the person I'm becoming. I'm not running anymore. And it feels amazing.

To anyone out there thinking you've squandered your life or damaged your mind - its not too late. All it takes is a simple decision. You just have to be honest with yourself and stop condoning use with whatever reason suits you. If you think you need to quit, you most certainly do.

I have enough money saved to pay my dad rent for a year, and I think I may leave my job so that I can focus on my papers and get into Uni - repair the damage you know? I've made an entire year plan and everything, I'm going to speak to him tonight. I want to become the person I was before, and better! And maybe taking a year to rebuild my mind is what's best.

Anyway that's my story - if you made it this far, thank you - and Good Luck!

We've got this! <3",3

I've been eating pretty healthily (my desire for unhealthy foods is linked to being stoned) and drinking lots of water to flush the system.  Working out in some shape or form daily to sweat out the toxins and tire the body out so I've got some chance of sleeping at night. 

I don't know what else to write so I'll leave you all with this... You are 1000x stronger than you think and your perception is key.

I’ll lose what’s most important to me if I don’t quit now,"So this weekend I was at my girlfriend’s. We hung out and smoked in the evenings. Normally we have a lot of fun and laugh our asses of. It can be a great bonding experience.

This time though. I got so stuck in my own head. I felt like a shell of myself. I had all these thoughts, but couldn’t express them or make them heard.

I just sat there smiling weirdly at her. And she was pretty animated, enjoying herself. I felt tiny, like I couldn’t participate in the conversations because I wasn’t worthy enough. I don’t know why but I got so insecure. 

We got in a discussion and she totally dominated me. She has a strong personality and usually we’re a match. When sober I feel like I’m a pretty confident, strongly opinionated person, I feel like I can express myself pretty good. And usually I’m naturally more dominant or as dominant as the person I’m having conversations with. That’s no dumb flex just some information for the context.
It’s important because it feels so devastating to get verbally murdered in a discussion you would normally have no problem handling. 

The herb made me so self-conscious and paranoid. I felt worthless, I felt like my girl looked at me with disgust. She wasn’t attracted to me at all that moment. And I understand why. That wasn’t me. That was a crude version of me, cognitively impaired by a drug. How can that be attractive. 

I met my girl in October. We had some trouble in December because I wasn’t really there when she needed me at times. Because I was high. I was couch locked and blacked out while she needed my support. She was crying in bed while I was no where. In the abyss, with no awareness, no thoughts, just zoned out. I quit at new years, because I told myself I would lose her if I kept on smoking. But yeah I failed and started smoking again in January. And here we are, back to smoking daily.

Today I’ll try and quit again. I am madly in love with this girl. I want to start a family with her. If I don’t quit today I will lose her. I have to be my best self, for me, for her, for us and our unborn children.

I hate this addiction and I’m deciding to end it here and now.

So here I go friends, day 1. I’m posting to help make it real for myself. My goal is to not smoke again this year.

If it’s day 1 for you too, I don’t know you but we’re in this together and we are strong individuals, we’re gonna do this.
Let’s go",6

Things were really good. My brain was sharp. I was on top of things in my life. I graduated a coding bootcamp. Then I met my now boyfriend. He smokes cigarettes, smokes weed and drinks beer daily. All the things I love to do. Get crossfaded chainsmoke and laugh at funny shit and shows together. When I met him, I dont know why, maybe it was bc I had finally met someone my age who liked and chilled in all the same ways I liked to after feeling surrounded by people in life that just judge everything, or maybe it was after 4 months sober, I felt like meeting this guy was the Universe’s way of telling me they didnt want me to quit weed.(i’ve got a schizoaffective disorder)

Regardless of the reason, I’m at a point in life where I feel the weed really does have to go again. Bc the beer has to go as well, and they go hand in hand. Im not an alcoholic, but I’ve developed a daily habit with the beer now after being with my guy for almost a year and a half. the honeymoon phase is over and we def have our problems in the relationship. And things just feel out of control for me. Like technically I’m handling everything ok for the most part, all these pressing impending urgent responsibilities that have fallen upon me over the last year due to my mom taking ill and almost dying. She got better and is doing well now, but she is in a home and I have to handle all of her affairs. like I said I’m taking care of business for the most part but everyday I smoke and drink and drink and smoke. its outta control

I graduated the bootcamp, got full stack certified and did nothing with it. Rationalized that I was focusing on building my relationship instead of job searching and coding to further develop my skills. It was a crazy whirlwind romance, then my mom fell ill. and here I am now. same job and financial struggles that come with it. And same person I was before I got sober for those 4 months. 

It was hard the first time around too. I quit so I could LEARN coding, but what happened was that I stepped into this more mature version of myself that was on top of her shit and didnt feel crippling anxiety and stress anymore. I was more confident. Honestly the woman I was sober scared me. I wasnt ready for her. which is why i think I dove head first into a relationship with a guy that made all my bad habits seem ok and ten times more fun. but now, well…I’ve had my fun. I want to get back to that woman that I was for that short time. But long term. The Universe will always find a way to communicate. I dont need to be high to convene with them. 

I dont know, I dont have a lot of faith in myself at this point right now to do this, to quit. But something has got to change. I’m not looking forward to the anhedonia, hit me hard first time around but I’m feeling pretty anhedonistic right now anyways. So I’ve really got nothing to lose. 

Coming back here to leaves bc the support makes all the difference. I really love this community.",3

Hi everyone,

I shared my recovery experience with someone today, who reacted in an unexpectedly bad way that got me down. 

I shared my withdrawal symptoms (night sweats, insomnia, moods) and they basically said that I was being ridiculous. They had previously recovered from heroine, and is a stoner. They basically said that anything I’m experiencing is just exaggeration. 

It was really aggressive, which felt unexpected because I’d never had that kind of experience with them. I also spoke only in terms of my own body and what I’d experienced (and was very careful to do so).

Anyway how do you handle the haters?",3

When I finally decided to quit it wasn't the first time I stopped smoking for a while but it was the first time I decided to do it forever, I had done it before for lack of money, as a tolerance break, because I was at my parents house or because it was affecting my relationships but in Octuber of last year after 6 years I finally accepted how much I was screwing my life with weed.

It took me dropping out of college, wasting so much fucking money, dozens of fights with my family, two relationships ending with the same pattern, doing shady things for money and just so much shame about how different of a person I felt while I was high to finally face the fact that I couldn't control it, I wasn't going to learnt how to do it and my friends and family weren't being narrow minded for telling me it was hurting me.

It was so easy at the beggining, I already had experience with the abstinence and it wasn't that bad, some anxiety and some trouble sleeping, nothing too serious, after the worse was done I was happy, proud of myself even for having a new goal and sticking with it, even when a lot of stuff changed in my life I stuck to my guns and kept at it. I had to move back with my parent but they fully support me despite how many times I've failed them already, they are just so happy im doing better now, they aren't even asking me for rent or anything like that. I finally finished a degree? (just a 2 year one, no idea the word for it), and now im doing a practice/internship that is going pretty good, is a nice place to work. Therapy has also helped a lot even if the first try sucked because the guy was a fucking scammer, but the next one was a legit professional and it's been really helpful. I've also been working out which had been the main thing making me happy recently because it actually makes me feel happy about myself, even if am still fat.

So what am I venting about? well living with my parents (actually grandparents but they raised me) can be kinda frustating at 25, they are great and I love them but it gets kinda weird interacting only with them most of my time, I used to hang out with highschool friends but it happens rarely and not many of them are around. Im still single and haven't felt like giving dating or sleeping around a try (or actually don't believe I would succeed, being high was a huge confidence boost), my job was rewarding at first but since im pretty much an internt I dont do much even if I have to be there 8 hrs with a 30 min break from monday to saturday so the routine is starting to get to me, also Im only going to get paid next month, most likely and like 240 bucks, not like I need it because im lucky enough that my family can and is willing to still support me but I feel pretty pathetic that I still need it at 25, tho even If I got paid earlier or more I used to only buy weed and food so yeah. 

What else? my therapist is on vacation so this last 3 weeks have been extra rough, I even considered to go back with my ex, which was probably a bad an unrealistic idea because even if I was the one who broke up with him im pretty sure he is seeing someone else already (a guy he was seeing while we were still living together lmao).

I guess this is all I wanted to bitch about, sorry if it is messy, I just really want to fucking smoke some weed but I know if I do it im going to keep doing it over and over again until im a fucking mess again and I will ruin everything I've accomplished this past 4 months and dealing with that sounds as awful as keep dealing with the daily craving of getting high. My therapist said is normal to fail once or twice in the process and the tempation of using that as a get out of jail free card is always there but I know me, is not going to be just once, the moment is in my body my whole brain is going to say whatever I need to hear to keep me high as often as it can because is the easiest it can get happy. But fuck, I miss the motivation of the first month, it was so easy to believe I really was going to never want to smoke again, but here I am, missing it like a fucking addict even if I finally im starting to get my shit together slowly with help of my family who is happy im finally doing great while all I've been thinking lately is how much I miss getting high.",8

I know it's only week four but it's like I only feel energetic for like a couple hours of the day when I'm active and then I'm just beat. I got past the insomnia. It's getting easier and easier to go to sleep. I'm thinking it's because I'm not used to taking care of myself and I'm finally listening to what my body needs. I guess I'm just looking to hear that this is normal. I know  I don't want to start again. I just feel so tired all of the time and take little pleasure in doing things. Thanks in advance!!!

I’m thinking maybe we can look back on our lowest points, and remember what state we never want to hit again, or we can keep spreading awareness about the addictive effects of weed. 

Here I go first : 

- rolled my joint with some kind of bread wrapper I found, I was out of rolling paper. Ew. 

- when I had one tiny little wannabe bud left, I would put it in a bong to try and get one weak hit that only always got me miserable instead of high. Pathetic 

- ordered my weed while at work because i was anxious of not having any when I would go home. Went to get it while on the clock. Irresponsible.

I just don’t want to be like that.
I’m writing this because tonight I was out of rolling papers, I found a neighbor that gave me two. But that wasn’t enough for my addicted ass so I thought why not cut them, it’ll last me longer? Also if I mess up my mixup at least it won’t be the whole joint right. Now let me tell you how pathetic I felt when rolling a tiny little stick. 

I’m from a family that is for some of them, from the Rastafarian culture. I do believe that smoking weed should be done in connection with the earth. If smoking doesn’t make you appreciate the plant and it’s properties, elevate your mind and free it from societal burdens, if you’re not enjoying the process of rolling (or else) and just doing it to get to the high, then you’re not doing it right.

The first three days is the conviction challenge. Do YOU really want to let this go? Or will you give yourself any excuse to get a hit? These three days can drag for a couple of months. It’s a test of character really. How much will you lie to yourself before you’re real?

The first three weeks are a withdrawal challenge. ‘If I could just take a hit this would all go away!’ sleeplessness and waking up in a puddle of sweat were nightmarish

And finally the first few months it’s relearning. Your brain is learning to walk without crutches. Training and adapting to your new lifestyle. Admiring the world for what it is, realizing it is enough and as mesmerizing just sober. Some friendships adapt to your new lifestyle and some don’t pass the test, and that’s okay.

The rest from there is simply you being you again, but a new you- comes naturally 

My cousins think I’m gonna be posting with a fat blunt to celebrate how long I went without it any day now 

That was my mentality at first. But I’ve worked too hard for this, and to be transparent I like life ~just as is~ even better

What do you guys do to celebrate sober accomplishments?",73

She was cheating on me and finally left, used WAY MORE to cope. Would wake up and hit the pen, come home for lunch and hit it, as soon as I got off work, to sleep, etc I could barely get high my tolerance was so extreme but I still kept shelling out the money for it. 

I was approached at work for a possible promotion into my dream role, but it would be roughly a 12month interview/transition. There is no way in hell I can if I’m constantly buzzed. I made it a goal to quit by the end of February. I’m also getting more important roles in some volunteer efforts I do, eventually I’ll be drug tested regularly. I want both these things far more than I want to be high. 

It was way harder than I knew it should be, I had to admit I had an issue and that if I wasn’t working, I was high. I’d always tell myself “just one more” then find myself at he dispensary spending more of my grocery cash. I don’t want to add up to total, it would crush me I’m sure. 

I read Digital Minimalism and Atomic habits, they helped lay the ground work and identify the triggers and change course as quickly as possible. 

I started training for endurance swimming, never really done lap swimming before in my life, but it’s amazing on my joints and exhausting, I can swim 3 miles straight now.

I got back into hobbies I missed so much, computer tinkering, balsa models, RC airplanes. I used to think I just didn’t have time or money for it, it was just going to weed. I forgot the excitement and joy I get out of these, so much better than a high. Working on a craft is meditative, honestly not dissimilar to swimming. 

Just day to day, I have a much clearer head. I enjoy work so much more and my performance skyrocketed. I can hold conversations and participate all throughout. I forgot how much I love reading! I couldn’t sit still long enough to read more than a chapter or less at first, but concentration has improved, too. 

I’ve been struggling to quit since New Years, but now I’m almost 3 weeks sober and it’s gotten easier. I feel so much more normal, but I still do get cravings, and do still have to power through them. The loneliness is the hardest part, communities are so necessary. 

Remember what life was like before. There are so many better ways to spend time, even a “useless” hobby. It’s still hard, but so worth it.",12

I posted in here late December when I was on holiday. I ended up not smoking for 10 days, mostly because it was pretty tough to get hold of in Austria. Anyway the withdrawals back then were far worse than anything I’ve experienced before. Over the course of 10 nights I slept on average 4 hours. Suffice to say I smoked as soon as I returned home and did so for the next 45 days. This Friday I had a surge of courage and decided to quit again. (The idea of quitting before is enough to give me a tight chest, clammy hands, racing thoughts etc etc). Anyway fast forward 3 nights and so far so good! My gf still smokes although she’s super supportive and doesn’t do it around me (she also always has smoked fat more than me). I would say we smoke 1 OZ per month minimum between us. Managing to sleep pretty well albeit waking up 5+ x per night. The vivid dreams are well and truly
Back as of last night. But, already I am feeling so much more clarity at work, less of a need to check and re check I have done something as trivial as locking the door, turning the oven off etc. Either way I plan to continue indefinitely, mostly due to the fact I resent the tether of weed when travelling, spontaneously staying out and not having any, relying on it to sleep etc etc. This group has been so helpful so far hope my spots can help anyone else starting out.

2022-02-21 15:29:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sy3jm4/day_5_lets_goooooooo/,Day 5 - Let's Goooooooo!!!,"I'm a first time poster and a long time lurker... and I must say that you all are incredibly inspirational.

I've smoked pot all day every day since I've been 12...  I'm now 39.  I subscribed to a lot of the propaganda out there amongst the pro-pot crowd, which is just as insidious as the propaganda perpetuated by the other side of the drug war:  that cannabis isn't addictive, or that cannabis is a safe alternative medicine that is misunderstood by the general public.

These beliefs cost me at a minimum 10 years of my life.  If I had been honest with myself in my 20s about cannabis.  Rather than being a cheerleader for the drug, maybe I wouldn't be taking this on at 40 years old.  In the end, I understand that this was part of my learning process and it was probably all meant to happen this way for me.

I was addicted from the first time that I smoked.  I remember the first time in 7th grade.  I smoke the next morning again and then bought a bag later on during my second day of usage.  I've had the cannabis veil over my eyes ever since.

I stopped in my 20s for 2 months to accommodate a probation program that I was forced into.  My mind was clear, I could see what it was doing to me and what a better man  that I was without it.  I took a single hit on a Saturday night to ""reward"" myself and within 3 weeks I was back to 24/7 usage again.  I tricked myself into believing that I could regulate, and it has been over 10 years since then of 24/7 use again.

I am married and have 2 sons, but my social circle has dwindled to nothing.  I don't like conversation, I like music and movies, anything I can escape into without talking to others.  It's turned me into a recluse and I'm sure that others see me as an asshole...  not because I mean to be that way, but because my cannabis addiction has made me extremely socially anxious and awkward.

Flash forward six months ago and it start to effect my professional life.  I've always been very functional (at least my addict mind thought so) and even started a real estate investment business.  I started having to skip work because of crippling social anxiety.  If there was a meeting when I would be expected to talk to others I would immediately start feeling waves of anxiety.  It got to the point of where I had to walk out of meeting with no explanation to the others around me.  Not productive or professional to say the least.

I quit cold turkey 9 days ago, relapsed 6 days ago and got back on the horse 5 days ago.  I was being mean to others and was looking for anything to make me less of a jerk.  i smoked and it worked, I was back to my cheery self within 15 minutes.  After reading this forum so much I was expecting it and don't feel guilty about it.  I understand that relapse is part of recovery.  I've got this.

Luckily I haven't been feeling a of the symptoms other have been feeling so far in the process:

I can sleep pretty darn well.. last night was the first night I had sweats and only got 2 hours of sleep, but other than that I've been sleeping pretty darn well.

No wild dreams yet, just mild stuff, which is kind of cool.   I remember when I quit in my 20s some of the dreams were incredibly lucid, not scary, just very real and memorable.  I can remember them to this day.

'The difficult part for me has always been the anxiety.  It comes in waves in the morning and afternoon and can last anywhere from half and hour to 2+ hours!  They are bad, I would classify them as panic attacks.  I grind the balls of my feet into the ground and wring my hands a lot.  I had a small bump on my back and had convinced myself it was cancer and that I was going to die.  It was a pimple.  Loads of nonsensical paranoia.  Not all that different than the panic attacks that I had been having during the last 6 months of smoking.

I haven't been exercising (I am completely devoid of energy), I have been eating a lot of garbage (fast food at least once a day) and I have been lost in television and gaming..  I can take my dopamine where ever I can get it from at this point. 

This is all ok.  I've been smoking for 27 years almost straight thru.  I knew there would be challenges and its going to take a couple months until I feel close to normal again.  I've started daydreaming about sober activities I can do with family/friends when I get my footing again (frisbee golf, climbing walls, bowling, etc.).

I used to have a mental block where I was completely afraid of explaining to my friend circle that smoke, that I had personally quit and would not be going back.  I know there is going to be disbelief, peer pressure, but I've worked out what I'm going to say already:

""Most people can regulate their usage of drugs and alcohol, but unfortunately I am not one of those people.  If I smoke (or honestly drink or do any other drug since I am an addict) I will be back to bong hits for breakfast within a week.""

I'm not sure any of this babble is helpful to anyone else, but it is very helpful to me to get this off my chest in a safe environment.  Thank you for creating this safe space for people struggling with this affliction to come and share their thoughts and opinions without fear of reprisal from non-believers.

I left school at 16. I still struggle to hold a job down for more than a year to this day.
I can't imagine putting a price tag on it but I know I have easily spent the vast of my total earnings on weed.

I started smoking every day at seventeen and now I’m thirty two. I’ve been really up and down about quitting lately. Some days I feel totally hopeless and other days I feel like I can do it.  The more I’ve hung here the more I have convinced myself I don’t need it and I can actually quit. Today is my third “day one” in two weeks but I can just feel that I’m going to have a day two and beyond this time. I’ve been tapering off a lot between these failed attempts and already started instating some new habits, so I’m feeling really strong this time.

My strategies are: 

-Reading at times when I know I will have cravings (mostly first thing in the morning and before bed). I’ve already almost finished a good novel and I feel great about that.  

-Reminding myself of how good/clear-headed I feel and how good I used to feel as a kid before I started.

-I booked my first therapy session (online with Better Help) in ten years which is a huge step for me.

-I’ve focused in on a mental image, or happy place, that I can think of when I’m feeling weak. My happy place is really weird, because it’s not even mine. I imagine Marc Maron (famously a former addict) sitting in a cafe with a notebook drinking coffee, completely sober.  It reminds me that other people have quit harder stuff. It reminds me that quitting will help me work on my creative projects and find creative success. And it reminds me that I like being in public way more when I’m not high, even though it rarely happens.

I thought it would be so hard, and it definitely was at the beginning (and still is at times). But looking back, I'm so proud of many of the decisions I've made over the last ~2.5 months. I hope you all can make the same decision and hold yourself to it as it will be better for you in the long term. I can say that I am already seeing what I've been missing out on!

I was a relatively heavy smoker for something like 5-6 years. I've tried to quit multiple times (unsuccessfully) and this is my longest streak so far. I've made it through new years eve, several other holidays and the superbowl, and not to mention all the times in between. I have turned it down many times so far and am around people who smoke occasionally (not nearly as much as I did). I was afraid of how hard it would be with some of my friends, but it has actually been much less of an issue than I thought. 

I definitely still have cravings here and there, but not nearly as much as I used to have. Now it's in very specific situations. For example, end of a weekend night with some friends and we've been out drinking and I may have been used to smoking ( a lot of the times by myself), so the mere situation will give me a craving. In these instances, it has been important for me, at times out loud by saying it, to acknowledge the craving is there rather than completely ignoring it, and choose not to give into it. On week nights and with some day time activities / hobbies, it's almost getting to the point where it is ""normal"" or ""default"" for me to go to bed or do things without the thought of smoking crossing my mind. It excites me that I've gotten here and I look forward to the day it basically doesn't cross my mind! 

There are so many benefits, many of which others point out in these posts. I'll summarize briefly so that anyone reading who is struggling in an early quit or just to put it down to begin with can look forward to these. There are the more obvious ones like overally mental clarity, feeling more sharp in general, actually remembering/experiencing dreams and my anxiety has come down. Takes some time, but feeling your body start to develop dopamine naturally is awesome. I would highly recommend trying to get into the habit of running or exerting yourself cardiovascularly early on to help with the low dopamine levels.

Then there are all what I would call the ""indirect"" benefits. You have some much more time on your hands - after the inital period of lethargy (I'm still not fully over it btw), you start to fill up your time and meet with more people, do more social, physical or mentally stimulating activities. You are WAY more present in your life. You think about what you're doing, why you're doing it, whether you want to do new/different things. Much more motivation in general to go after your goals, or even simply set yourself some goals. 

I hope this helps somebody. If anything, I just wanted to pat myself on the back, but I know this is a much longer effort. I am looking forward to next 73 days and more broadly what my life has to bring. Cheers everyone - I've learned so much from reading all your other stories and perspectives.",6

I am so disappointed I can’t handle my addiction and I can feel that people around me grew tired about me failing. I am growing older and I feel like I am supposed to be responsible but since I can’t quit I am doing it secretly now. I know there is no answer to solve my problem right now but I feel trapped and feel like I have no one to share it with anymore. 

Maybe this is like a first step to break my secrecy again. I am just so disappointed and I know that, in fact, some people close to me will be too.

2022-02-21 09:48:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sxv8i7/its_out_of_control/,it's out of control,"hey all, I've found myself planning to stop smoking after a week of fucking off and smoking at every opportunity possible, early in the morning, middle of day, etc. I usually don't do this (this past week is what broke the camel's back (I usually just smoke at night), usually I've been smoking every night for the past year and a half, roughly). Smoking is really easy to do because I can work from home when I want and make my own hours. 

To give some background, I was introduced to weed on the tail end of a very traumatic experience. Fortunately through therapy the past couple of months I've been able to pinpoint that subconsciously the past year and half of me smoking was me hiding my feelings from myself, numbing them to the point I can wake up and be functional throughout the day. I did smoke throughout all of yesterday except to go to sleep (which was huge in its own right, even though I was smoking throughout the day). I want to get better and not be so reliant on something that initially was a coping strategy - albeit not the worst, but definitely not the best or most healing/productive. I've always found myself on these subreddits, and after reading a couple of stories on this one this morning, and seeing how supportive this community is, that has led me to make my own post. 

I really do want to have a plan that I won't say 'fuck it' to and really stick to. I know it's not going to be perfect the first time around, and mistakes will be made, but I want to feel like I've made solid progress. Whenever I tell myself I'll stop smoking, I plan to read that night or do something else, but by the end of the day when I get home, I find myself lighting a bowl. I am just asking for advice, and if people want to share their experience and what has helped them, I'm all ears! 

To give a little bit more detail, I've found that smoking has not allowed me to write (which is part of my job and something I love to do). I've sincerely missed it, but I always have these thoughts that are like, ""try it while high,"" or ""it will be better if you're high."" I find that every time I do get high I find myself less grounded/out of the experience and just want to stare at a screen, get more high, and then pass out. All my motivation gone. I know I've basically answered my own question of why I need to stop smoking, but if anyone out there has any advice I would appreciate it. I don't talk to anyone about the severity of my smoking issue except my therapist and even posting in this subreddit is a huge step for me. I appreciate you reading to the end of this, thank you. Peace be with you.",1
2022-02-21 09:28:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sxutl8/quitting_again/,Quitting again,"So my journey started in December. I told myself I need to stop smoking because it was making me anxious and ruining my social life. I wasn't enjoying smoking anymore and just made me anxious and super in my head. 

I was able to stay sober for one month. In that month I worked really hard working on myself, improving my skills, and going to the gym a lot. The gym became my outlet for weed. I gained a lot of muscle and was looking good and feeling good. I got a lot of my confidence back. 

My goal was to start working on myself and curve my everyday smoking and just do it on the weekends after my month off.  

I started smoking again on the weekends this month. When I started smoking again I did not get anxious and just had a good time. I was still staying on my self-improvement grind and going to the gym. But I realized that I wasn't really staying on my self-improvement grind. I noticed after 2 weekends of smoking that:

\-My motivation went down

\- I was still going to the gym but was slacking on my self-improvement of reading, meditating, journaling,  etc. Instead, I would stay in bed on my phone just wishing to smoke and just distract myself with social media.

\- I caved twice and smoked during the week twice. However, on those days I went to the gym while I was high to make up for it. When that happened. I told myself it's okay if I smoke on Wednesdays so it's the middle of the week. I used it as a reward. But I told myself if I do it I have to go to the gym which I did. This was not part of my plan. It was supposed to only be weekends.

\-I have constant thoughts of wanting to smoke during the week which is hard to fight off sometimes and it makes me only look forward to the weekend so I can smoke. 

\-When I smoked on the weekends it was only at night after I got what I needed to get done for that day. But when It was time to smoke it was like 2-3 hours before bed. I would smoke hang out listen to music. Then I would watch porn and masturbate every time I smoked and not socialize with people.

\- This morning I feel like I felt like I am slipping into my old habits and mindset. Also felt like I lost some of the confidence I gained back. so I am going to quit again to try and get better control over weed. 

I am sorta angry with myself that I wasn't able to control it. But let's see what happens after this month.",1

Wasn't able to go to work today due to major anxiety, don't know who I am without smoking and have lost all sense of identity

2022-02-21 08:57:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sxu4fk/sleep_troubles_during_withdrawal/,Sleep Troubles During Withdrawal," Yes, the weed withdrawals suck. My biggest thing is the sleep, which ironically is the reason I started smoking in the first place. Anxiety about not sleeping before a big \~insert event\~ the next day or a couple bad nights of sleep would build to the point of panic. At first weed did help. Smoking all day would numb me to the point of not caring whether I slept or not... so naturally I would sleep like a baby. But what kind of life is that? Being dependent on putting yourself into comatose just for some non-REM sleep. When you get off the weed the sleeping, at least for me, initially will get worse. Which is terrifying, especially if you are busy with a career/kids, responsibilities etc. Which leads me to my advice. Talk to your doctor before quitting. Ask to see a psychiatrist and be completely honest with them. Tell them you are going to quit weed and need a short term plan to help you get to sleep when withdrawals are their strongest. Between week 2 and the month mark I see the most improvement in my sleep and can slowly start dipping my toe in the unassisted sleeping pool. 1 good night of unassisted sleep can lead to 2 and so on. If you have a bad night, no problem, use the help the next night to break the cycle. The main thing is to build unassisted nights of sleep on each other until you hardly think about sleep anymore. Despite whatever depths of hell you are in right now, you can do this, and it does get better, but please do not suffer in silence and ask for help. You're not alone.",6

Here’s my study.,"Hey guys, I’m 31 years old male, I have been smoking for about 8 years. I will not talk about withdrawals because like most of you, yeah, I had them and it wasn’t fun. I want to share with you one of my comments here which I found to be interesting to some.. so here it is.

I’m 27 days off weed and tobacco,
Here’s my short study: 
There is a part in our brain called Striatum, in short- it is responsible for dopamine regulation.
Dopamine releases as a reward after we do stuff we like/ we finish things. When we get THC, especially the high % that we have nowadays, we are pouring in Dopamine, which I call PDBW (Pouring Dopamine By Will). A chronic THC user’s brain stops releasing enough dopamine when he does activities, because his brain requires the OUTSIDE stimulation that he gets when smoking. 
When you stopped smoking, your brain is in a negative dopamine state and it starts to re-wire itself back to normal in a non-linear way (which means it really depends on how much you smoked, how long and the specific brain properties) = one needs a month, another needs 3 or 6 month etc.

The bottom line is that it gets better and better.
Your brain will be fixed and you will enjoy doing stuff.
By the way - if you would do something that is “Extreme” like parachute jumping, downhill mountain biking, you’d enjoy it a lot more than the “normal” activities because the ones I mentioned are related closely to Adrenaline.

The more important thing right now is forcing habits.
There are 3 steps in the “Habit” circular life:
1. The Cue - The thing that triggers the “ohh fuck I want to/ I need to..” for example: if you used to always smoke with a cup of coffee- the coffee itself is a CUE. Sometimes a cue might be that weird feeling inside your stomach/chest which is hard to describe.
Find all CUEs you have/had.

2. The Routine Action - the actual thing like SMOKING, eating your nails, getting high or whatever it is.

3. The Reward - The “good feeling” you get when/after your routine action. (THIS is your Dopamine releases)

To change a bad habit you can’t do nothing with the CUE or the REWARD, the only thing you can do is to change/replace and force the ROUTINE ACTION until it sticks and the new ״bzz bzz” connection created in your brain. Instead of smoking, read a book while drinking coffee. Do it again and again, every day. You won’t enjoy that at first - but stick with it, and the habit will stick with you eventually.

I hope what I wrote was clear. 
Enjoy your new life and never let the brain win in this battle. You are the one in control, and there is no better feeling in the whole world than having a total control over your brain.

Love and Peace.",369

What to do now?","Hi everyone. I’m 25 and have been smoking daily since 14. The first 2 years of my smoking was fun and games with my homies, but after that I’ve been unable to quit.

I’ve been working 9-5 since 16 and at 18 I got my first sales job. I still work 9-5 every single fucking day.

I’ve always wondered WHY I couldn’t quit. For some it’s trauma, for others, low self worth. For me, as I’ve just realized, my energy is drained on a daily basis, by feeling trapped and confined to a workplace every single day. When I smoked, I could live through this and not notice being spiritually drained.

Now I’m here. 1 month in and work just feels like a huuuuge undertaking. I feel confined and scammed out of my freedom.

I can’t come to terms with the trade off 5:2, where I work 5 days for 2 days of freedom. And to make matters worse, I spend 1 off day planning my week ahead, washing my clothes, shopping groceries e.t.c, which actually leaves me with 1 day to what I want. How can people actually accept this?

So I’m left here wondering what to do… I could go back to smoking and medicate myself through this 9-5 nightmare. I could quit my job, but what then? I could freelance, but that’s just an even bigger workload.

The system is rigged, and I’ve been smoking to accept that. No more.

If I do it now my anxiety becomes two fold because I think I'm going to have a heart attack with my heart going so quick. I lost interest in doing a lot of things I used to love. It's hard for me to get up in the morning but I'm taking steps to alleviate all this by speaking to a professional weekly. It's a very slow process that I hope gets better. Just wondering if anyone has any advice or experience with this? I want to get my sense of hope back.,10

This morning I woke up, vomited from panic, and cried at the bottom of the shower.

This afternoon I went to the beach with some friends and I felt like I wasn’t even there. We went to a new place farther along the coast and there were tons of rocky cliffs and as my friends were laughing and carrying on I had intrusive thoughts of imagining throwing myself off the cliffs and happily hitting the bottom. I felt insane and it was really a surreal and dark part of my day.

Then as the day went on and spent more time in the sun I started to feel a bit more like myself. Had a cocktail around happy hour time. The intrusive thoughts were there but less often and I was like 50% present with my friends and enjoying.

Now in the night time I’m feeling better. Some negativity and apprehension but I at least don’t want to die and can imagine a future worth fighting for, which is a welcome reprieve to the crazy dark parts of earlier today. 

I’m not trying to freak anyone out, I know that shit’s dark but I wanted to be honest with my experience. Man, what a fucked up drug. I’ve never been more committed to sobriety after seeing what this has done to me.

Hope day 18 is brighter. Love you all, hang in there for my sake and yours.",5

I love smoking but I know I have to quit for the sake of my lung capacity and my relationship. And I know you might think “Well… just quit..” but my brother who is also my next door neighbor is one of my smoking buddies, we already have a routine  where I frequently go to his place to get baked and chill for hours, refilling the bowl like 4 times in a time frame of 3 hours :/ I am not proud at all of my consumption but it’s harder to quit because even though some days I smoke so much until I get bored and just not even enjoy the high anymore, but most days I really enjoy weed and I wish I didn’t because I want my clarity and freedom back but I keep sabotaging myself and lying to my loved ones that I’m quitting for good. 

TL;DR: I want to quit but I have free access to weed 24/7 due to my brother always having MJ and it’s so hard to have real will power",4

2022-02-20 20:21:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sxgwco/my_story_looking_for_support/,"My Story, looking for support","I started smoking around 11-12 years ago consistently. I am 33 now and I have been trying to quit probably since around 26. I have always been a pretty heavy user but the last year or so sometimes I would finish an ounce in a week just by myself. Thats $200 a week! I can't afford that lol. I get super angry and rage over little unimportant things, especially if my 7 year old is acting up! No matter how much I smoke I just feel normal. I know its holding me back from achieving my fitness goals that have been important to me since I was 13.

I started my own moving company and its been going great but when I started being home all day and not going to a dead end job I was able to smoke all day, everyday. I knew I was in trouble once I started waking up in the middle of the night and in the morning to smoke so I could go back to sleep. I am constantly thinking about when I can smoke again even after I just smoked. My daughter knows I smoke and tells people randomly that I smoke, so keeping it a secret is very stressful. I used to do hard drugs 6 years ago and my parents think Im completely clean because of all the progress I have made but secretly Im suffering. I want to talk to my parents about it but I don't want to disappoint them.

The only thing that really keeps me from getting sober is the super intense night sweats. Sometimes I will wake up 3-4 times a night soaked in sweat. Like I just got out of the pool, my bed is so wet that even if I changed my sheets I can still feel the wetness through the new covers and sheets. I know I just need to be prepared with extra sheets and clothes, I just need to man up and do it. The intense nightmares and scary vivid dreams don't help either, even after 2 weeks sober they were still pretty intense, sweating and the dreams together. The longest ive gone is 2 weeks not smoking but I was chomping at the bits to smoke again. I have quit here and there in the 12 years I have been smoking but nothing with mentioning!

I know quitting smoking will give me the confidence to get back in church also! I am just looking for like minded people who support others because it seems like anyone I talk to about quitting just tells me its completely fine! I have told people I think its the weed that actually making me angry but everyone wants to tell me just smoke another one and they urge me not to quit lol.

I have not quit smoking yet. Last night I waited till 8:30pm which is really good progress, usually Im smoking by 8am. Today I haven't smoked at all but I probably will right before bed. I have been also learning to fast at the same time so the hunger kind of distracts me from wanting to smoke or dwelling on it. I am pushing myself to push my times further and further back, lowering the quantity but I know in another few days I will go completely weed free. I found this reddit by reading a book. One of the best books Ive read this year ! God bless, thanks for reading. I appreciate you taking your time to read this!",4

I'm going to give myself some credit for making this far. I made a plan, it has to be the key to success in the first week.

You’ve got to remember that you are the constant in your life, and also that you are who has been there EVERY step of the way.

Think of the way you’d treat a dear friend who was struggling— and use this to remember to treat yourself with love, patience, and kindness. This journey will be challenging at times— but YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS. You are stronger than the urges, that will continue to come and go. 

Remember: affirmations/what you affirm to yourself will either hinder or help you, especially during this time. Talk to yourself with supporting words and kindness. Root yourself on, every step of the way. Even and especially if or when you stumble. You are so strong and so much more than just capable of following through  with putting an end to this unhealthy, soul sucking habit. 

Your brain will throw temper tantrums at times because it has become used to you coping with cannabis when you’re bored, and/or going through things. Change the thoughts that tell you “just this once would be okay” or “I’ve stopped for ___ many days! I’ve shown myself I can partake occasionally!” These sort of thoughts are your brain just trying to justify you feeding this addiction, again. Each and every single second that you resist— you strengthen. 

You’ve got this!! 

And, if you need anyone to talk to— I’m here! 

Also, I do want to recommend trading out that habit with something like meditation, working out, yoga, writing, or creating. Something that will benefit you and make you feel grateful for yourself and your life 💗",71

When I used to smoke I would always browse reddit. And somehow I always ended up on this page. Reading all your stories and the amazing support you give freely. It's beautiful to see.

One week ago I was smoking. I had probably smoked like 10 joints that day. I was about to go to bed and ended up here again. I had just bought weed too. So I had plenty. But suddenly a thought entered my mind: ""if you don't stop this now, you will spend all day tomorrow smoking again. This is your last chance"" I got up and threw all that weed down my toilet. I still remember the sound the weed made went it hit the water *plop* and the sudden electric jolt I felt. 

The first few days my mind was blank. Nothing gave me any stimulation. I didn't wanna watch anything, I didn't wanna game anything. I just laid in my bed and went on walks. Sometimes multiple walks. I could figuratively feel my brain rebooting. 

Just a couple of days later I felt amazing. I was at a party yesterday. My friends kept telling me something was different about me. They could feel like I made a change somehow. So I had to confess how much I have actually been smoking for the last 2 years. 

I've been smoking on and off for about 10 years. The last 2 have been really heavy and I now see that I was addicted. I couldn't see that when I was in the haze. Not even in my darkest most desperate moments. 

I can definitely feel I'm not 100% back to normal yet. Gaming still does absolutely nothing for me. Shows I can watch a bit of. But my mind is so much more clearer. It's crazy that I couldn't see what the weed was doing to me as I was in it. Now I feel ashamed I ever let I get to that in the first place. 

When I was smoking I never felt like there was enough hours in the day. I just wanted to keep smoking. I would sit up late and just keep smoking ""that one last joint"" I would rarely get more than 5 hours of sleep. That's 2 years being sleep-deprived. I haven't been good to myself. All I cared about was smoking weed. 

I really wanted to share my story with you guys. I've been a long time lurker and now I finally decided that I just can't control weed. It will consume my life. 

Things are definitely looking up. My mind is getting better. I can smell the trees again. I almost cried when I smelled the woods again. I haven't seen or been with a woman for the past few years. But you know what? I got a date this wednesday. 

I hope that after you read this post I will have lodged something in your brain. Everytime you put that joint up to your mouth you will remember this post.

Remember that the days can and will get better.",145

I began smoking at 14yrs old. Not everyday, and not big quantities, since in my country is illegal and very expensive. Lets say that i smoked about 1g per week more or less. 

Then at 20 yrs old i quitted due to depression, and i started again more than a year later. 
Then i smoked everyday from 22 to 23, since i moved to a country where is cheaper. Then again i quitted some months. In quarantine i smoked daily, but really little quantities( 10g in 3 months). 

From feb. 2021 until last week i smoked daily(about 0.5g per day on average), and since i quitted i feel so so good.
Yes i miss weed at night, because i used to smoke before bedtime, but i just can't relate to many stories here and i was wondering why weed hits so differently some people. 
I have to say that 10 days before quitting weed i left a very very very toxic relationship, and since then i began feeling great. Is possible that the joy from leaving my ex gf, is so big that masks weed's withdrawal?

I felt bad only on Friday night, since i was feeling very lonely and bored and didn't know what to do without my joint, but now i just feel normal(during the day i can say that i feel euphoric). 

Just wondering if someone is feeling the way i feel.

* 30 years since I started using weed in February 1992


What's on my mind at this point:

* Still relieved when I wake up from a relapse dream
* Fighting replacement habit demons (evening drink(s), random internet doom scrolling, compulsive shopping, etc)
* In a big productivity and motivation rut.  
* Having trouble rebooting my shattered attention span
* Fitness habit came to a sudden halt in Oct when I started a new job
* Feeling emotionally flat or depressed (related to the above items)
* The thought of using is creeping into my mind 1 - 3 times a week now.  Mostly related to being buzzed after a drink and giving too much power to the flat feelings. 


So yeah... feeling stuck-ish in the mud.  Still pushing forward slowly though.

This is my first post, and I'm here mostly because I don't really know what else to do with myself. I had been a daily heavy smoker for over 5 years prior to last month, when long-simmering mental health issues led to a desperate urge to kill myself and a subsequent trip to a psychiatric hospital, where I was held for just over 3 weeks (1 in the stabilization unit, 2 in the trauma unit). During my stay, I was diagnosed with other specified dissociative disorder and told by every psychiatrist, therapist, and social worker I worked with that I absolutely needed to quit weed, as a dissociative drug is the last thing a person with a dissociative disorder needs.  
I was discharged last Saturday and have managed to stay sober the last 8 days, but am at a loss as to what to do with myself. My disorder and the trauma that caused it has left me largely disconnected from myself and unable to find pleasure in things that once amused me. While my brother and sister-in-law have graciously allowed me to stay in their home while I recover, I feel profoundly lonely most times and miss the very few friends I have terribly when they are not around. The virtual day hospital program I am enrolled in is not at all helpful, and at nights I find myself mindlessly scrolling on my phone, essentially trying to will the day away through sheer mental effort. My brother and SIL still smoke every night, and I find myself missing the one thing in life that used to bring me even a sliver of amusement or happiness.   
There's obviously a lot more going on here than just quitting weed. I have massive self-esteem issues as well as a death wish that is complicating matters. The worst of the withdrawal symptoms have passed, but now I'm left with an empty void and zero lust for life. Thanks for reading folks. I hope you are all out there living your best lives.",9

I've been a chronic smoker for the past 8 years. I guess I am what you would call a functional stoner. I was high 24*7 but no one knew cuz 

A) I am sufficiently good at what I do at work. I am a web dev , so my daily job didn't involve much physical interaction. I just got high and finished my tasks.

B) I live alone so i had/have no one to judge me. So I either smoked up or smoke cigarettes to get me through the day. 

Over the years, I gained comfort in smoking  up because that assured me all was right in world. All feelings of loneliness etc were repressed everytime I smoked a j. 

I ran out of pot last week and I made a decision to not call my dealer at least for a month or two so I can get rid of my addiction.

Its day 3 and I do seem to be going through the same depressive phase like everyone in this sub.

However , I also get this constant urge of wanting to get physically hurt. Like i have this vivid picture in my head of wanting to get punched in the face. When I close my eyes , all I can see is me being face to face with a stranger and he's beating the crap out of me.

This is probably not the right subreddit to ask and I know I have some issues that only therapy can solve ( I tried. It doesn't seem to help much) .

I was just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.",3

It sucks that it took me so long to get to this point, and I put myself and others at risk because of it, but I've finally done the right thing. I just find it incredible how much it was affecting my life without realizing it. And the lives of other people, most of whom I don't even know.",10

My habit started as a bartender/server. The high pace of the job made it so hard to relax and come down after work, and I would always have work nightmares. Smoking helped me relax and get to sleep without dreaming.

Fast forward 5 years and I've used weed to ""sleep"" pretty much everyday. Now that I'm out of the restaurant industry I don't have nearly the same wrong stress. Days 3-6 of quitting were rough, unable to fall asleep and then up early. Oddly enough I still had more energy than usual lmao.

Anyways, last night I had the best sleep I can remember. I had FUN dreams and got a solid 10 hours. This is unheard of for me. I feel so amazing today.

I'm also coming off my anti-anxiety meds because I'm certain my anxiety was weed withdrawal during the day mixed with a severe lack of resorative REM sleep. My doctor fully supported the decision and I'm wheening off by his guidelines. I haven't been drunk in about 1.5 years now as well, so I'm very excited to experience a completely drug-free brain for the first time in years. 

For those of you struggling with insomnia in the early days, keep at it and don't cave. It's so so so worth it!",3

Withdrawals are no joke and are still intense (depression, insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite, etc.) but every day gets easier. One thing that has helped a lot through this all is actually finding a reason why you want to quit and be set on that fact. I went to visit my parents for a WEEKEND and did not smoke for those 2 days and suffered my first full blown anxiety attack. I had no idea what was going on and when we went back to town and smoked I felt completely normal. No anxiety no racing thoughts, just normal. I came to the realization that very moment that my mind and body were dependent on it and just thought how sad that was that I need this substance to feel like myself. I decided that moment that that’s not how I want to live my life and was set on the fact to change that. 
After finding this sub and seeing how many other people are going through the same thing has helped me realize that Im not the only one going through this, and that recovery is possible. Feel free to ask me anything as Im still in the process of some serious withdrawals and I’ll be glad to answer. 
YALL STAY STRONG WE GOT THIS.





Edit: To ask if anyone had any tips for motivation and or searching for new hobbies to help keep my mind out of this pit of anxiety/depression. My ONLY hobby all these years were smoking and doing things that revolve around smoking so now that Im not it’s really hard to find motivation to seek out these things.",15

2022-02-20 13:12:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sx7f7e/time_to_leave_childish_ways_behind/,Time to leave childish ways behind??,"Man, Idk anymore guys. What a world we live in huh? I suppose everyone tries to quit for different reasons, nobody’s being better or worse than the next. Weed is a huge part of my life and has been since I was about 18. It has affected my life in a multitude of ways, but the older I get the more it seems that it has a negative affect on my life. This is my story.

I’ve lost 2 jobs because I either could not pass a drug test or refused a random drug test. Marijuana being the only thing I would test positive for in both instances. Also, I’m about to be a father and I feel in my heart that there isn’t room for ME (not making a generalization) to be both a good and attentive father and a pothead. So why is it still so hard to quit? I want to quit, I see the benefits of quitting, but the banality of weed is so pernicious! I tell myself it’s not that bad! People are tripping, and the man is trying to hold us down. Weed doesn’t make me worse at my job so why do they care? They’re just ignorant right? 

But, then I continue to lose grasp on the better parts of my life because of weed. My job is in jeopardy primarily but also my character. If I have a talk with my wife and we agree quitting is the best course of action, and then I don’t quit. Am I being a good and honest partner? All the shit I talk about other people being bad husbands or fathers and they could prob quit smoking weed no problem and here I remain stuck with this pervasive problem. Now I’m reticent to say that weed is my ONLY problem but it’s the main one i need to work on right now. 

So today I’m quitting for the hundredth time. I woke up this morning and didn’t use. I have an endless amount of good reasons not to use and every time I want to use I’m going to try and remind myself of those good reasons. I’m hoping that becoming part of this community and talking about my recovery process will be an excellent resource for me and I thank you guys in advance. 

I appreciate the anonymity of Reddit. I don’t want to go to 12 step meetings and counselors. I know this is a terrible outlook to have, but they embarrass me, and I would be embarrassed to attend ( I don’t think I’m alone here but I digress) I think I can do this “all by myself” that is to say, with your guys’ help and support. 

My father attended 12 step meetings both under court order and voluntarily through out my life and I attended an AlAnon meeting for children of addicts. I HATED IT. I know it works for some people but I can’t get over the old feelings I have of being forced to go when I was younger and forced to pretend things were bothering me that weren’t. 

Idk if there are any people here that had similar situations but it’s a mind fuck to be told by other people “how bad you’ve had it” or that “you need to talk about these things with people so it doesn’t mess you up in your head down the road” and having no feelings to talk about. Even at a young age I was able to separate my parents fuck ups from my own life. I knew they were drug addicted and losers, and I didn’t care. I just wanted to be left alone. 

I have the same feelings now. I just want to not deal with it, I want the world to change around me and for pot to suddenly become “OK” in the eyes of the “job givers” (stupid but idk what else to call them…the man?) 

So I thank you for reading this slew of unconnected and flighty feelings and ideas. I will check back in each day and let you guys know my progress. There was a guy who was 12 days sober who posted yesterday and you’re an inspiration dude. I feel like if I can get there… to that point … it’s all downhill from there. I have an amazing reason to quit and I am super excited to see what I may be capable of sober as I haven’t been sober since I was 18 (I’m 33). I know it’s “just pot” but it’s caused a lot of damage in my life. I’ve gone to jail, lost jobs, and spent copious amounts of dough. 

So now I’m “just quitting”. For my son that isn’t here yet and lives in my wife’s belly. For my grandchildren, my wife and myself. I feel like marijuana is an incredibly special useful and amazing literal gift from god. But I have abused this privilege and do not have the relationship with pot that god intended people to have (if he did at all) That being said I am not putting pot up forever, but if I can go 5 years, I think I will appreciate smoking more and (in my crazy mind at least)  “deserve” the privilege that is marijuana. I acted like a child and now I’m about to have one and a child cannot raise a man. It takes a man to raise a man. And a man can quit smoking pot if he wants to…right? 

Thanks for reading guys, felt good to vent, sorry about poor grammar, punctuation, run on sentences, etc.

One love!",10

Before that, I was able to make it to 2 weeks but caved. In those 2 weeks though, I did a lot of reflection. I want to know what drives me to abuse weed. I know part of the answer can be with the chemical rewards my brain gets, but I can't shake the feeling that there is something in my life that draws me to smoke  


I feel like I work really hard for other people in my life, professionally and personally.   


Professionally, I became very depressed and started using weed to cope after being fired from a job. I feel like I've improved myself since then after getting a diagnosis for ADHD and getting help from a therapist and psychiatrist. Still, all my work is assigned to me by superiors: teachers, bosses etc. I like the work, but juggling responsibilities between 4 classes and 2 (part-time) jobs can overwhelm me.  I would rather have a lot of work for one job than a bunch of small assignments for different things.  


I think my Personal ""work"" is the biggest challenge. When I'm with my friends, family, or SO, my primary focus is making sure they're happy, which sounds fine, but this includes days like my birthday or when I'm not working.   


When I have time for myself, I'm still worrying about taking care of things at the house for my SO. We moved together to a new state, and she hasn't made any friends, so I always feel terrible if I'm doing something, even if it's just for me, and she's alone. I'll admit that I've slowed down on doing things like Stand Up or working out so I can be home with her instead. I love her deeply, I really really do, but I also feel like I need more time to just be myself and do things I want to do. 

My birthday was the other day, and the whole time, I was so nervous that no one was having fun, and as the birthday guy, I came up with the plans. I don't even care about doing things I would want to do. What I really want is to hang out with my friends, so I always pick activities based on what will get the most people to show up without a lot of planning or pressure. And still, I spend the time worrying about it. 

&#x200B;

So now, I smoke when I am by myself. I don't want to feel the pressure or expectation to do things, I want parts of my day for just myself, and weed acts as a chemically induced mental block for anything outside my immediate focus. It's the easiest way out from that pressure, and I know in the long run that it will make me more unhappy. Smoking makes me do nothing and content with the time I do have for myself. It makes me overeat. It can ruin my sleep. It's not great for my bodily health. Most of all, it's making me run away from my problems, but they always catch back up. So how do I escape them again? smoke more. Rinse and repeat.   


I hate any expectations of me. I wish I could be more selfish with my time without feeling like I'm letting someone else down.",3

At first and like many others I did not smoke regularly, only a few times a month. I really liked the feeling it gave me, the feeling of everything making more sense in a way and the way I felt more in peace with myself and everything around me. That still hasn’t changed. After half a year or so I stopped, since I had a really bad anxiety attack because of it. I felt so paranoid, it lowkey scared me of. 6 months go by and a friend of mine asks me if I wanted to smoke. Since a lot of time has passed I thought I should give it a try. That was all it took. Now 3 years and thousands of dollars spent later, I have never been more addicted to something like this ever before. The anxiety and paranoia I felt back then never came back and I never felt like this ever again when I smoked. The opposite happened, I never felt better. There is just a part of me deep down, whom craves it so bad it almost kills me being without. I know, quitting is the best thing I could do, but after I have tried to quit probably every day for the past year, I don’t know what to do anymore. Being without it makes me literally go insane, it gets to a point where it’s so bad, I can’t describe it anymore and I really do not know what to do anymore. I see how it ruins me financially and how it sucks up my energy, but still it’s not enough to convince that it’s not worth the feeling smoking gives me. I will keep on trying to live without day for day and just want everything to be over and the cravings to stop. I would be happy about any suggestions…Thank you",1

Not that I've quit getting high, but that I waited this long to stop. My life has been falling apart  and I was using that high as a bandaid. The problem was that bandaid was covering a slice in my metaphorical jugular. I have never felt so upset as I do now when I think about all of the relationships I let fall apart. My family doesn't even talk to me anymore. I've spent the last two days trying to reach people I don't even know are still alive to be honest. I know nothing I do can fix the past. I'm happy to be taking steps in a healthy, positive direction. But, damn. Don't wait until it might be to late. Hug your loved ones and be kind to yourselves. Wishing you all the best ❤",50

I tried working out, meditating, reading, gaming, but no matter what there’s always a 10-15 min stretch during the day when I just get bored, and that weed starts looking mighty tasty…

I even tried throwing away all my gear, but I live in cali so all it takes is a walk across the street and I can buy all new gear for like $20, with an oz of green delivered within an hour. 

Does anyone else have this problem? Do you just stay borderline manic all day to never let yourself rest and be tempted?

I’ve quit before for 6 six months being the longest amount of time. This time is different because I have been noticing myself spiraling down a bad road. Been feeling depressed, sad, and angry. Can’t control my emotions and see myself turning into someone I’m not. 

So far on this path to getting sober, I have experienced nausea, vomiting, and headaches. 

I’ve thrown away all my paraphernalia and any weed I had in order to help make this a successful journey. My biggest problem will be dealing my friends who still use and abuse. I’ve expressed to them my desperation to be clean. I’m not only doing this for myself but for my family as well due to them having concerns and them just wishing me well. The pressure to get over this addiction is staggering. 

I write this to ask, what should I expect to deal with as far as withdrawal and any other symptoms that come along with getting clean? In addition, I am wondering if there is any medicine or supplements I should take to help assist make this a successful journey to sobriety. What tips or advice can y’all share that has helped you complete your journey to sobriety?",2

I consumed all day, everyday. I’ve posted in this group a million times wanting to quit. But I couldn’t. I’d make it until 9 or 10am and cave. My days would be ruined because I couldn’t concentrate and I’d eat and eat and eat. By supper time I would feel like shit. Then I’d do it again all over the next day. The cravings were so strong. 
Three weeks ago that changed. And I know this is different. One night I felt so hopeless and sad. So I wrote down how I felt. High me poured my heart out to my sober self, pleading not to use and why. It’s a pretty sad bit of writing and even high-me knew that. She wanted to stop sober-me from ever using again. I threw out every single bit of weed I had in the house. 
For some reason this clicked. Every time I read that letter, I am sad for the high person that wrote it and it hurts my heart enough that I remember how I felt in that moment. 
It’s worked. For the first time, I’ve been sober 3 weeks and not once in those three weeks have I even thought about consuming once. Not once. It’s weird, but it’s completely worked.",458

What I hated and what I appreciated.,"Today I have gone 6months without weed and it’s made me very introspective and I’ve been reflecting a lot. For 4years I was smoking occasionally, but since the pandemic I was smoking heavily everyday. During the last year or so I was high from the minute I had no obligations in the day. 

Here’s what I hated:

- The CHS. After about a year of heavy use I’d vomit constantly. When I ate a bag of popcorn and threw up, I was blowing popcorn kernels out of my nose for a few days. 

- the depression and anxiety, ironically I was trying to feel better emotionally but weed just made it worse.

- DPDR. I felt like I wasn’t human, I was totally dissociated from my sense of self. 

- Feeling completely numb

- Not being present with my significant other and friends 

Here’s what I appreciated:

- Weed helped me eat, which made me stop starving myself as much and helped me get over my eating disorder 

- I knew I wanted to do something with my life after wasting a few years being stoned with no motivation. 

- I became so much more empathetic, because I now know a taste of addiction and how hard it was. 

- Feeling completely numb. I have been disconnected with my feelings, and being completely numb helped me realize I wanted to feel again. I have CPTSD and my childhood was so difficult that I couldn’t cope, but shoving my feelings down was tolerable numbness was so intolerable that I worked to reconnect with myself and my feelings. I’m grateful to the numbness, because things will continue to be better. 

- Being silly with my friends, I did learn to not take myself so damn seriously.

Ultimately weed isn’t for me, and until I actually want to live my life and be totally present, I’m done. I needed this experience of addiction to learn what I want and need out of life, I’m done sleeping my life away. There are so many bad things that came from weed but I want to acknowledge that while addictive, weed itself wasnt the problem, I was the problem. I let weed take the wheel, and now I’m taking it back. I’m celebrating my 6months, and can’t wait for the time I’ll continue to be present, feeling the good and the bad, and living my sober life.",34

So i did smoke for a whole week not really much 2-3 hits of joints or wax(2nd was bad idea)
After the 3rd day that i smoked the anxiety came back everytime i wake up in the morning or after a nap
I also feel like my left hand leg and face side are a little numb( all symptoms i had at the begging and eventually left) i know they willeave again im just frustrated that all the effort and pain of the first 3 months went to hell
I hope that i didnt go back to square one and if i did i hope it doesnt take as long to feel good because i really did
This showed me that my body clearly is not reacting good to weed in any form and its not for my anymore

I succeeded to quit several times for periods ranging from weeks to months. Every time I relapsed after I had thought that I would never do. Ultimately I found that I have never recovered, I just stopped using the addictive substance for some periods of time, but the addictive mind set, the addictive thoughts and behaviours never changed. Recovery from addiction is not a matter of willpower. It is a radical change in your way of thinking and your life routines that took you to addiction in the first place. 

For any one who is struggling with any kind of addiction, please consider this advise seriously. To rely on your willpower only, will lead to multiple failures and frustration and will never help with your total recovery.",25

Glad this community exists tbh. 

Been smoking weed on and off since being at university. Felt like it gave me such deep thinking and insane ability to be self aware to a degree beyond anything I have ever experienced. It feels like stepping out of the illusions of the mind and emotions and insane level of focus. I reckon I have ADHD so I think weed helped me experience the ability to zone into one thing and appreciate it in a profound way. 

I like that state of being so much, feels like exiting the matrix. I am pretty bored in life, I have a fixation on changing the world and self improving and have no hobbies or interests outside of this.  Grew up super poor and my family basically wouldn't let me leave the house and we never did anything, so I feel a bit empty/lack of experiences, compared to alot of other people. Other people seem really happy and inspired by stuff and really good at socialising. Anyway, this combination of being poor and depressed feels like a prison and I think being high is an escape that felt ""productive"" because I was feeling smarter or having unique insights. 

I would want to be high all the time, everyday, at work, around people, with my girlfriend etc. I even moved into smoking cigarettes and quickly was smoking 5 a day on average. I have managed to stop and I don't want to go back but I want to get into that same state of mind again. I know its cliché but meditation seems to be the answer I'm always going back to and even when I'm high was the answer I would go to as a way to replace it. Just want the ability to snap out of my thinking patterns and also have positive feeling and desire to do stuff. I think 1) stop jerking off (I do 5 a day pretty much everyday) 2) Get sick at meditation and I think transcendental meditation is a good one. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone found meditation or nofap to have helped replace the great feelings and mindset of being high or have you guys seen any other ways to replace that stuff e.g. hypnosis? 

&#x200B;

Thanks everyone and if you're on the same journey, good luck and don't let your mind trick you into doing it!",6

**Little background story:**

 After I lost a close friend of mine who also smoked (a lot of) weed two years ago, I kind of lost myself. I started smoking more than I liked. Probably as some unconscious tribute to him. (Plus lockdowns didn't help lol)
I mostly smoked after dinner, with some exceptions on non working days (and some on working days as well, yay working from home), but I did smoke about 1-1.5 gram every evening. I had enough excuses why I had to smoke weed and they all overpowered reason not to.

**Quitting story:**

About a month ago I finally made the choice I had to quit. Drugs was affecting my life in a negative way and that's not the relationship I want to have to have with drugs.
So I decided to take two weeks off of work, so my withdrawing wouldn't affect my work.
And withdrawing I did. (This was also an excuse before why not to quit) When I wanted to sleep my legs would start to hurt so much that it made me angry because it would keep me awake. My body didn't know how to regulate it's temperature, I felt like a woman in menopause. I had severe headaches and insomnia. It was hard the first few days not to smoke, until I noticed progression.

Now 8 days later I feel absolutely reborn. I've slept two decent nights in a row. I am happier, I burst of energy. I have never felt so good about myself as I do now.

Where previously I postponed everything and just watched Netflix and smoke, now I feel like I want to be productive and shape my life in a positive way.


*To everyone thinking about stopping: do it!
To everyone battling with the symptoms: they're really just temporary! You are doing great! Every joint not smoked is a win!*


Will I stop forever? Definitely not. I love weed. It's an amazing drug. I just need to reset my relationship with it. From now on I will treat it like I will treat any other non-prescription drug. I will use it a maximum of a few times a year. I was addicted and will leave that behind me. I do not see an addiction as a disease and definitely do not agree with the American superstition about once an addict always an addict. I am certain this won't happen again.",5

My sex drive is much better. My patience with others is much better, as is my compassion for others. 

I was a bit of an emotional train wreck the first week or two but now I’m feeling much more stable than I was. 

It takes a lot more to frazzle me these days. I’ve had a much easier time responding to life’s events rather than reacting. There’s a huge difference there. 

To anyone struggling, keep going. It does get better. 

When I feel like shit meditation and working out seem to be the greatest remedies.

It can be very comforting, soothing and calming. It feels safe. I mean it is great, and I don't see any problem with enjoying it once in a while. The problem begins when this embrace is something you rely on in your daily life. It is easy to live a life you are not conent with, put on autopilot mode and get through the day, knowing in the back of your head that in the evening you will be embraced and everything will be all right. You might ignore the need for human closeness, connection and relationship, because you already are in a relationship that gives you this warmth. You might ignore dissatisfaction with your current relationship, skip working on it and communicating because at the end of the day you will smoke (alone or with your partner), and the relationship will be ok again. As I said, I don't see anything wrong in enjoying this embrace once in a while, it can be a very positive experience. But relying on it everyday means being in an artificial relationship with a plant.

I also believe that, the more we have been deprived of mother's warmth in our childhood, the more the effect of weed is attractive for us. This effect can even be therapeutic, but I think it stops being therapeutic once we start to rely on it, and when we exchange real experinces for the high.

I think a good way to measure if weed has positive/therapeutic effect for us is to look at how smoking weed affects our sober life. Do I feel more conected to my partner, other people, myself and the world in the next days after smoking? Or do I feel zoned out, blank, anxious, counting the time until I have a chance to visit the highlands again?

Sadly, for many of us, specially those who've been relying on weed's embrace for too long, it might take a long time of sobrierity or even be entirely impossible to be able to access the terapheutic potential. ",43

I do work out but I find motivation hard, I play video games but they just don't feel the same, I like outdoor activities but they just don't seem as interesting when I'm not high. 

I don't know if its just my sober mind not finding anything novel in the world anymore or if it's just who I've always been when sober but I just really want the fun to come back into my life. It's all just muted colors and feelings and it's getting tiring.

I gave up alcohol aswell just prior to that. In the beginning it was hell, i couldn't sleep, eat, think, I was suicidal and confused about who the fuck I even am. Some time earlier I hade just gotten out of a toxic relationship and started university. I've been clean for 6 months and my life got so much better in every aspect. I focused on myself and let everyone just go. It was a tough journey the first 3-4 months but then things got better. I got my hope back and started to set goals about my life that I've reached. I am happier with myself and know more who I am today. I have forgiven myself for whatever bullshit I got myself into and cleaned up my mess. In a couple of months I'll graduate, at the age of 33, and I've started to work and save money. I'm happy with life even if my smoking buddies are gone and I don't hang out with people at all most of the time. I feel stronger and I believe in a great future. 

Yesterday, I was at a classmates and smoked a joint for the first time in 6 months. I had planned to do it since monday with her, but I wasn't looking forward to it at all. I just wanted to know how it felt, if it still had a grip on me or not. Right after I smoked I felt guilty as hell and didn't enjoy it more than 5 minutes when I had a good laugh. I regret smoking it and realized how much I actually hate doing it. I remembered what it had done to me before and how much I would lose if I got into it again. It was so not worth it. I've lost many years and will not lose another day to it. Also the weed was too strong, I could hardly speak and no way I'll do it again. Im happy with my life and I'm never going back to addictions of any kind. I can see clearly and I'm finally in control over my decisions. I'm glad I smoked yesterday even if today I feel like shit, because now I know that I'll be alright and never going back to that misery.

This community has helped me through it and I'm forever thankful. I wish everyone who's trying too quit the very best of luck. Don't give up trying. I know it takes a few relapses but you'll get there. Just don't give up. I want you to know that it get's so much better after som time. You can do it, so just leave and go through it.

Goodbye Mary Jane!,"First of all,  thank you to everyone that posts on this subreddit.  I have been a lurker on and off over the years and I really appreciate being able to hear about all your experiences.  

Weed is not the first thing I’ve quit.  Over a year ago I decided to quit alcohol, although I was not physically dependent on it and normally didn’t drink too much,  when I felt social anxiety or just plan down I struggled to find my “off switch”.  Quitting has been hard, I love feeling buzzed, but now I barely think about it and I’m so glad I quit when I did.

Weed has been much harder to quit.  I absolutely love the feeling of being high and it’s not nearly as punishing the next day as being hungover.  I have been a high functioning stoner, but I could tell it was starting to affect me physically, nauseated in the mornings, it affected my bowels, my memory and most of all it allowed me to not address my depression which steadily got worse.  

Even so, I hated the idea of giving it up for good, but I knew I needed a break from it.  So, after smoking daily for years,  I decided to take an extended break that lasted 6 months.  I experienced ALOT of withdrawal symptoms including: headaches, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, night sweats, and depression.  It felt like the joy had been sucked out of life.  These symptoms came in waves and lasted much longer than I expected. But, with time, I gradually felt better.  

I convinced myself that I had taken control of my habit and that I was ready to “moderate”.  I did just that at first and it was amazing.  I remembered why I loved weed. But, I gradually slipped back into a daily habit and my depression and feelings of worthlessness were back stronger than ever.

I finally realized that I have to say goodbye to weed forever.  I am envious of people that can have a healthy relationship with this plant, but I know that just like alcohol, it can’t be for me.  I’m am now around 3 weeks (I didn’t note the exact day because it doesn’t matter to me) in and I’m feeling like shit again from the withdrawals.  However this time is different, this time is not a “break” this time is forever.",9

Found this sub last week while I was trying to quit cold turkey myself. On week two now and all the symptoms seem to be getting stronger. I want to just lie in bed all day rewatching comfy YouTube videos to distract me from the intense boredom and hopelessness but unfortunately it seems that life continues regardless of how I’m feeling! 

I’m 21 and finishing up my uni (my last semester) and everyone in my family only seems to talk to me about when I’m finding a job and who and when I’m going out with people both dating / socialising. All those things fill me with I guess a very strong anxiety to the point that I compulsively avoid them even before using weed as that avoidance. 

No one in my family really knows I ever did smoke and are all around anti drug, so I am dealing with the sobriety mostly by myself too.

I keep having small epiphanies of my low self esteem and desires to protect my ego from rejection or failure, but I still struggle to make myself act or change my introverted and avoidant behaviours. 

It’s like waiting for a euphoric lightbulb moment where everything will click into place and I’ll become ready for anything I want to do, but I know that’s not the case.

I wanted to know if other people have had similar experiences dealing with major life anxiety where self esteem is so low every challenge is something to be avoided, and what steps or progression helped start getting you out of that hole?

Kind of just blurted out a lot of my thoughts, might have been by myself for a tad too long.

I was a heavy edible/cannabis oil user ingesting at least 100-200mg a day for the last two years so many of you could do the math on that. I also have been smoking consistently for over 5 years. My use had picked up last year after I lost both my uncles in the same month due to suicide and the other being ran over by a subway train. I have decided it’s time to grieve like a man and face my emotions head on. 

I do still feel brain foggy but I’m not worried, that will pass and I was blowing my brains out with all that THC in my blood after all.

It's all sorta been a blur. I've gotten so used to being high that now reality feels like the drug.

 I began smoking weed socially in high school on rare occasions, and in my first year of university that use began to accelerate. It was almost overnight, when I started to smoke all day ever day. At first I was disciplined with it, only smoking after class/when work is done, then slowly I began lying to myself and convinced myself that I can do anything high with no effect to my performance(in fact, my dumbass convinced myself I was doing better high. Side note:Thats a lie that we all tell ourselves, you can never do anything productive better while high than being sober, period)

This abuse continued for years throughout my undergrad and even after I graduated in summer of 2020. I honestly saw no problem with it and thought this is just how adults live, everyones addicted to something right?

Wrong. And I realized that in the beginning of 2021 and really started to see an issue with my cannabis use that I was completely blind to. It made me lazy, dull, lack self esteem, increased my anxiety 100 fold (no joke, before weed: no anxiety. after weed: Crazy anxiety. that's the best way to explain it ahaha), amongst other ill effects, some unbeknownst to me. At the time, I had a crazy drive to quit and I finally decided to do it. 

That brings us back to the first sentence of this post. MY OFFICIAL DAY OF SOBRIETY. First week was a little tough, and I won't divulge in the details because i'm sure you're already very informed about the withdrawal process if you're on this subreddit lol. As time progressed however, my life became an absolute dream. I could not describe to you the type of natural euphoria, drive, and energy I was experiencing during my period of sobriety. All my anxiety was absolutely gone. Part of my job requires public speaking and on many occasions while still smoking weed every time Id go up to do any form of public speaking my body would start shaking tremendously and i would not be able to catch my breath at all. Resulting in very embarrassing situations for me. I couldn't quite budge why the fuck that kept happening because in general Im not an anxious person. When I went sober, I knew for a fact it was from the weed. A month into sobriety I was able to public speak with ease, no fear, no nervousness, no shaky voice, nothing. I was my true, fearless, unapologetic self and I didn't have that extremely self conscious whisper from the weed that tells me I aint shit and that Im better off being at home doing nothing. My whole life in general was healthier, I began making better health decisions, stopped jerking off completely, was much happier in general, no anxiety, and most importantly I was freed from the need to medicate myself to ""have fun"" or ""feel better"". Sounds absolutely amazing right?

Well it was, but unfortunately it came to an end. On November 12, 2021 I was going through a really tough day and a friend of mine happened to be smoking that day. All this time, I have been more than fine around my smoking friends, I was around weed a lot during my sobriety and had zero issues. But that day for god knows what reason I decided ""ahh splitting a joint with my friend won't be an issue, I've been sober for 9 months and have been loving it, ill get back on track tomorrow."" 

Well..... that was a HUGE FUCK UP. That one night spiralled into absolute abuse of carts and weed over the last three months to date. I have been smoking all day, constantly tired, constantly lethargic, extremely anxious ONCE AGAIN (who woulda thought ey), extremely low self esteem, lack of self love/respect, borderline depressed at my state. During this period I have lost complete respect for myself and I continue to ask myself why the fuck I still do it since I barely even get high anymore and all weed really does for me that's SOMEWHAT of a benefit is help me sleep. Im starting to resent my self and the decisions I made and it has resulted in me being in a deep dark whole of regret, anger, sadness, anxiety and so much more. I need this to end and I willl put an end to it. I know I can quit weed and I know if you've read this deep in you can do it too. It can be done and the grass is much greener on the other side idgaf what kinda withdrawals you're going through life WITHOUT DRUGS is ALWAYS BETTER than life WITH DRUGS. 

I say this all to say, If you have already been sober for a few months and struggling with thoughts of relapsing, don't ever do it. You don't realize it, but your mind is rewarding you every single second you stay away from something you want so bad that you know you shouldn't be doing. You are building mental toughness, and most importantly your self esteem will improve because you are showing yourself you can do it. 

To those thinking of quitting, my word of inspiration to you is that I promise things get MUCH Better. you may go through hell for a week, maybe a month, even 6 months maybe, but eventually i can say with certainty that your life sober will be a difference of day and night between your life on weed. 

TLDR: if you're already sober, don't fucking relapse. If you are not sober, get sober. 

Thank you for listening to my ted talk.

Part of me wants to go and grab a cheap pre-roll on the way home from work and relax and maybe play some games or watch something while smoking.  But part of me doesn't want to deal with the anxiety that I believe i would feel if i were to smoke.  

Thinking about just ordering a pizza instead.

Smoking weed for me is a way to relax in theory but it never ends up that way.  It usually ends up with me feeling worse about my boredom and leads my mind to spiral.

I've 'tried' to quit a handful of times, but I always give in without a fight. I've written down all the reasons I would like to quit, all the things I feel being high so often is preventing me from doing, ways to help it 'stick' (give my weed stuff to a friend for safekeeping, activities to try and do in the evenings when I would typically vape, things like that) and I just can't seem to find the motivation to actually try. But I feel like my life is passing me by and things just keep getting worse and this is just one of many ways I'm getting in my own way.

Not sure why I'm posting this lol, but I think I feel too embarrassed to tell my friends I'm quitting only to immediately fail again, so instead I'll tell some strangers on the internet in case it makes me feel accountable.

I have never been a heavy smoker, since i do maximum one joint per day, before bed, but i am changing my life and i need a bit of support. 
2 weeks ago I broke up with my bpd girlfriend that abused me for 2.5yrs, i began going to gym, and now i try quitting weed. 

The problem is that i live in another country, with no family and few friends to hang out.
When i stay home alone, and i don't have to work the next day, i really feel the urge to light up one joint and ""enjoy"" my free time( don't really enjoy since weed gives me really strong anxiety and paranoia).

I had a really hard time during the last 3 years, i lost my father to pancreatic cancer in 2020, my ex cheated on me in that exact period(and again two weeks ago, before breaking up with her), and i am changing all these things all together. 

Do you have aby advice on how to fill the free time i get from leaving weed? I don't really want to do productive things, i just want to do something that my brain perceives like ""chilling"". 
I already work, study, meditate, and workout. 
I really need some help, because i am feeling great without these toxic people and behaviours in my life, the only problem comes when i am alone with nothing to do. (Like tonight, that no one wants to hang out, and usually this meant that i had the night for me to smoke and so on)

I’m really happy and excited to share that today is officially one month since I decided to stop smoking. First and foremost, I couldn’t have done it without the support of this community. Hearing stories and getting advice from other people going through the same thing was really crucial for me accepting this challenge head-on, and for developing better habits in place of my smoking.

Since this journey began, I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and started on prescription medication, I’ve booked an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about my anxiety and possibly ADHD, and I’ve really tried to prioritize my physical and mental health. I’ve started journaling frequently to stay in touch with my emotions, I go for walks/runs at the park every day, have reignited my interest in reading, and started learning a foreign language.

This isn’t to brag or to say that any of this has been easy though. I’ve made a point to be intentional with how I spend my newfound free time, and the biggest improvement I’ve made in my life is slowly adding in habits that make me feel good about myself. I don’t do these things because I think they’ll look or sound good to the outside world— I do it because they are changes that I feel will improve my quality of life. I’m not even halfway to where I want to be in terms of developing my best self, but I make a point every day to remind myself of how far I’ve come. I am proud of all that I’ve achieved so far, and I’m really excited to continue this success and growth throughout my journey.

Weed for me was not the issue. It is not some demon or some abstract monster that was holding me back. It was a crutch that I over-relied on to help mask or ease much bigger concerns with my mental and physical health. Without it, who knows if I would’ve reached out for support earlier, or if I would’ve just succumbed entirely. It’s important to me to not blame my issues in life on this drug— it does a great deal of good for many people in this world, and it truly did help me in some of my darkest moments. With that being said, I’m grateful to have gathered the strength to reach out for support and find healthier ways to thrive in life.

I’m sending lots of love and support to anyone thinking about starting, just beginning, or well-on in their journey! We can do this!! Hope everyone has a great day/weekend :)",10

What started as religious sacrifice during the Catholic holiday Lent on Ash Wednesday of 2021 for 40 days continued further as I decided to make it a lifestyle choice. Near the end of Lent, I was dumped and devastated by my ex, so I decided to hit the reset button on life. Along with other areas in life, I knew leaving weed behind was for the better. 

I used to be high *literally* all day long for about eight years. Wake up, smoke, brush teeth, smoke… repeat throughout the day… and fall asleep with the pen in my hand. 

It was very hard for me to quit. I still get thoughts to smoke. But the best advice I was given was saying to yourself “I won’t smoke today”. Don’t worry about tomorrow. 

- I feel energetic, more awake, I sleep (and dream) better, I feel lighter, and mentally clearer. 
- I get less migraines. 
- I’ve been so much more efficient. I freelance as a career and I’ve done much more work and made much more money than ever before. 
- I’ve saved a ton of money!!
- My skin and eyes have been brighter, clearer, if that makes sense. 
- My general energy has been obvious to friends and coworkers. 
- I feel happier.

I had an awful sleep, and experienced full blown sleep paralysis, and if you haven’t had that before, I envy you. The past month and a half I was basically waking up, getting high and throwing the day away. What’s the point in that? I get high, then I can’t drive anywhere or do anything, and I end up just wasting the day doing nothing productive. That throws me in a down ward spiral, mentally. But instead of fix it, just rinse and repeat the next day. Fucking absurd. I had a really hard time admitting to myself I have an addiction, and it was even harder to admit it to my partner. I must say the response I got after admitting it to her was not quite the reaction I was expecting. The “oh well, it’s just weed” mentality is a trap. Addiction is serious. Take it seriously. 
Anyway; if you read this far thanks for hearing me out, even though it’s a scramble of thoughts out into words.

I also started going to Uni, and so the stress of life just increased a ton for me, plus I didn’t have a girlfriend for the past 5 years, and was very close the having one but it didn’t work. I always say to myself that I know that when I’ll have a girlfriend, I will be able to tolerate a lot more, hence will be able to stop smoking.

I’ve been smoking just about that entire time. Everyday. Sun up to sun down. While it was fun, it was definitely holding me back. At this point, the urges are basically non-existent for me unless I’m drinking. I only drink in social settings and only smoked in non-social settings so those tendencies pretty much balance each other out. While I feel it hasn’t been as bad for me as some others, I’m not without the stupid things that led me to rock bottom to climb back out. 

The masturbation was really just an experiment of self-discipline I wanted to do this year. But it’s really evened out my moods and helped me deal with light anxiety. I have more overall energy on the day-to-day and feel more present in every situation. I also value sex a lot more instead of treating it as an endorphin chase. This could be a result of not smoking, but ya know, one hand washes the other.

I think what truly helped me was switching up my entire schedule, sticking to said schedule, eating healthy and being more active/working out. I know everyone says this but it truly makes the difference. I’m also a big believer in brain association so I immediately started doing all the things I associated with smoking while sober so my brain could disassociate from those “high” activities. Everything from making music (I’m a producer) to watching my favorite shows on repeat, movies, taking walks. Dive in, stay active and do not get bored! Also get rid of it. All of it.

I wanna thank this community for the support and non-judgement it brings to everyone and their situations. I’ve been lurking here a few months and I’ve hardly ever seen anyone pass negativity or judgement. Stay strong.",603

It usually wasn’t an issue for me to only (“only”) smoke/vape in the evenings. But then I got hooked on nicotine, which made my cannabis consumption worse somehow (??), and then the pandemic hit, and I returned to alcoholism hardcore, and cannabis was the least offensive thing I did. I was convinced the world was ending in 2020 and I deliberately sought to turn myself off. 

Last November/December I managed to quit alcohol again and also nicotine. I cannot overstate how difficult it has been, more so with nicotine. (now over 80 days without!) I have chronic mental health problems, obviously, and the withdrawal has been nightmarishly destabilizing. 

I know my life will be better without cannabis. I suspect I’d be fitter, eat less, and have more hours in the day. I wish I could moderate it, but I don’t think I’m that guy. I am just so exhausted from quitting my other vices that I feel exhausted thinking about quitting weed too. I just like…weed isn’t hurting me as much as alcohol or nic. It’s still more benign. But I’d be 100% better without it, presumably, after I deal with the wild destabilization of my mental health AGAIN. 

Right now I literally cannot go a day without being stoned, which is the main problem, and imo more than enough of a problem without others. (There are surely other problems but after 7 years stoned, idk what they are.)

I feel weak and tired and I don’t want to. I was hoping someone in here would have some interesting perspective that helps tip me over the edge to Just Doing It.",2

I have a group of friends that I occasionally play board games with. And another group of friends I play local Mario Kart with. It's normal for both groups to have drinks and light a few spliffs.

I stopped smoking 48 days ago. In the beginning it was very hard but it's significantly easier now to resist the urge of smoking when I am alone or with people that never smoke. After all I have very solid reasons to why I quit and my mind is set on it.

I remember one time three years ago. I was finally sober for a few weeks. Then I was hanging out with a group of friends watching a sports game. I was already on my second beer. A spliff was passed. I could not resist and was happy to join the smoking. Only a few days later I was back to smoking all day for months/years.

That's the reason I really don't trust myself to hang out with people that smoke. This is very hard for me, because I enjoyed these activities(playing local video games / board games / watching sport game) very much and I also miss these people on a personal level.",7

2022-02-18 01:43:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/svbbo5/day_3/,Day 3,"I'm on day 3 and feeling great.

I've tried to quit before. I went cold turkey from smoking 5-6 joints a day for about 5 years. I remember the withdrawals and the hardships. The loss of appetite, the anxiety, the boredom. I successfully did that for about a month.  I've relapsed since then.

Then I found this community towards the end of December last year. You guys changed my life. I was working by then already and smoking around 1-2 joints a day. After reading everyone's stories, I decided to only smoke one joint a day and then go for one joint a day on weekends only.

Four days ago I was on my last joint and I decided I won't even bother going for the one a day on weekends. I want to start NOW. I looked at that joint and I looked at the date. Feb 14. In my head i thought, This would be a great Valentines gift for my wife as well. I didn't tell her this though. I just made up my mind myself.  I decided I will smoke this in one go and enjoy this all the whilst telling myself this is the last time with you old friend. You've helped me a lot in my younger years but now its time for both of us to move on.

Of course I got blitzed out of my mind and was dizzy going to bed after. I kept reminding myself of the feeling. I told myself ""Never forget that for you, thinking that you'll just smoke one puff or one joint will eventually lead you back to this moment right now. This moment of feeling anxiety and guilt. It was a real love/hate moment I had with that final joint.

I don't know if it's because I weened myself off for about 2 months but the withdrawals are much easier to manage this time around. I finish work. I play basketball or go home. I have dinner with my wife. Usually I will smoke and play video games but now I have been mainly watching TV for the past 3 days. I always want to play video games throughout the day and at dinner, but when I actually get to my room, that desire disappears. I just want to lie down and close my eyes. I want to nap. I understand this is all part of the process. I understand my body is healing and like many of you said, show love to yourself in these times.

Guys thank you for sharing your stories. For the longest time I""ve been trying to fight this alone not knowing there were thousands of people around the world giving me free wisdom. Tomorrow is Saturday and I just talked to a friend of mine who has also given up cigarettes (different but we can relate). Hes encouraging me to keep going. I think I'm going to go get a gym membership tomorrow and buy a bicycle as well! It's been so long.

I also cried for the first time yesterday in years. Full on tears and sobs. And it felt amazing.  I can't wait to meet myself again. I love all of you so very much. Everyone has their own pace and their own journey regarding this addiction but remember that we all went through similar experiences. And that in itself makes everything less frightening anxious and lonely.

&#x200B;

P.S: I am 26 years old, male, and married. I've been smoking daily for about 10 years now and currently been sober for 3 days. I've tried to quit about 5-6 times in my life and hopefully this time will be my last. Shoutout my beautiful loving and caring wife who supports me regardless of my choices and emotions. I've told you I am going to quit many times and always relapsed but you never made fun of me or gave up on me. Thank you my love.",4

Ive wanted to quit for awhile, especially since starting my anti anxiety meds. They heightened my high and first it was fun. I wish I hadn’t started to abuse it. It only grew worse until December I suffered from a seizure. Woke up confused and bruised. I’ve never had one, and Im pretty sure it was a mixture of both nicotine, weed, and my anxiety meds. But I didn’t stop. The anxiety only grew. I want to be healthy. It’s just really hard. It’s hard knowing that the feeling was worth feeling like I was dying.

This has genuinely been one of the worst rxoeriences of my life. I am 25F and started vaping thc carts about a month and a half ago. And I hit them hard. All day. Everyday. I still had the thought from when I hung around stoners that there was nothing physically addictive and thc never had any withdrawal. Ive learned the hard way that isnt true. I got hooked on those things. Hell I was so in need of them by the end I was going through the old carts trying to see which ones had a few drips and drops of oil in them. It was when I hit one that did nothing but send a huge hit of cotton and metal into my lungs that I finally ""woke up"" and questioned what the hell I was doing! My partner and I decided we needed a break from weed and didnt get anything to renew our supply. I wouldnt realize until day 2 what was happening to me.

I've been so blessed to have a wonderful life partner to care for me while I'm going through this. I dont think I would have made it through this by myself. Less than 10 hours of sleep, barely 500 calories kept down (at times I havnt even been able to keep water down) and 1 panic attack since Monday. Terrible stomach pain. Zero appetite. Ive basically had every symptom minus the agitation and the THC cravings. Im in too much physical discomfort to want to even look at a concentrate. And I never want to go through this again.

Im glad to know theres a community for support and I need to thank you all for how much helpful information we found here. ❤️ it made a huge difference in what we did to treat me as it got worse!

Unfortunately I didn’t remember how much control of my life I gave it in the past. Since then, I have been abusing weed to escape my issues. And the more I smoked the worse it was when I was sober. I started to think that I was this depressed person if I wasn’t high. And it was the case, but only because once I got high, all the love and happiness that I had inside was finally free to come out. I kept reminding myself of my boyfriend saying that when I’m high I’m nicer and in a better mood. Which would just make me want to get high because why would I want to be a downer. 
I’ve been trying to quit again for a while, but it’s been really tough. And I decided I wouldn’t be so hard on myself anymore since it clearly wasn’t helping. 
I think that yesterday I finally accepted the fact that one reason as to why I was so down when I was sober is because I was giving out all of this love and happiness when I was high. And there was nothing left for sober me.
It’s like something clicked and I finally meant it when I said to myself “I’m not going to smoke today”. Today was quite easy to stay clean and I’m really proud of myself and relieved honestly. 
I’m not the type of person that posts, here let alone anywhere, but it is really important to me that I stay clean so that I can fully confront my issues and move forward with my life. So I’m doing this to share my story and ask for your support s well as to say thank you to those who have helped me through their sharing. I hope this helps someone somehow as well.",6

I have used for about 8 years, but it wasn't until the last 4 or 5 years that I became a daily smoker. I'd quit for a little while to clean up for a job, but it was back to smoking as soon as I could. I'd start smoking as soon as I got up in the morning and continue all throughout the day and into the night. Initially, I was doing well with maintaining some productivity while being high, but weed quickly made me complacent in doing nothing. That's fine once in a while, but it was an every day occurrence. I am a graduate student and a musician, so I have a lot going on. I can't afford to ""do nothing"" every day. Plus, I play a woodwind instrument. I kind of need my lungs to be in good shape. 

I am tired of depending on weed just to feel normal. I am tired of constantly spending money on a substance that I really, truly, don't even need. I want my life back. I want myself back. 

I am a recovering alcoholic so I know I can overcome this too. But man, those first few days are going to be tough.

Whether it was work, school, watching a movie, playing a video game, even at family gatherings I convinced myself that I had to smoke or it would be boring. Well, I’ve had enough. Today is my day 1. I have a fair share of other concerns and issues when it comes to quitting, but the one thought that seems to always hold me back is this fear of being bored. How do you overcome this feeling? For example, I love movies more than anything. I watch a movie every single night. But I can’t shake the feeling that suddenly I’m going to hate movies and this piece of me that I feel is so important to who I am as a person has all been a lie because of my habits. In the logical side of my brain I know this isn’t the case but do you guys have any advice for how to shake this dread about quitting?",3

I wouldn't say I'm bored, because I can sit here and enjoy TV or Netflix or my game. I wouldn't say a part of me is missing either....I just feel like I always am looking for stuff to get me through to the next day you know?

Had to leave work early today because of the rain/sleet and the temps are dropping. Didn't want to be stuck in that. But as I was coming home I was sorta anxious because now it's like I would usually go home and get high and relax. I know it's from my habits I've developed over the few years...just wondering if people run into the same issue.",0

The initial coughs and withdraw wore off, and I was feeling like I had never smoked to begin with. I told myself: ""see? There was no lasting damage, everything is fine. I can smoke again and it'll still be fine."" I was just starting to get bored and wanted to smoke again. By some miracle, I decided not to. 

I woke up sober this morning - then proceeded to cough up half a lung. It was a whole affair, I ended up crying from the force of the coughs. Got a lot of gunk up and I think I taste some blood. I still feel a little something in my lungs when I breathe in. 

Suffice to say, I'm so glad I didn't smoke last night. Because my lungs are definitely not done getting all the shit out yet. 

If you are reading this and would like to humor me with some conversation, how long were you coughing for after you quit, and how bad was it?

I have a lot on my plate today and I kept waking up this morning with rushing thoughts of what needs to be done. This made me toss and turn for the last three hours and when I finally got out of bed I felt so dizzy I thought I was going to pass out. I have a therapist appointment at 1, I don’t think this is the right therapist for me and that’s partially giving me anxiety, but the real big thing (which in reality is probably a blip on the radar) is moving a mattress from the apartment that I’m leaving and bringing it to my parents house. I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years and this is the apartment we shared together for 3 of those years. But it’s also the place where I used weed to mask all of my problems. I know this is a small thing, but it feels insurmountable and my brain has been thinking of all the ways things can go wrong today. 

I also know that I need to make a lot more changes. I’ve been getting so stuck in my head, which is causing me great anxiety and crying spells. I feel like I’m stuck in an awful loop. I don’t want to die, but I also feel like I don’t want to exist anymore. I feel like a failure, a loser, and an all around piece of human garbage. And I’m so lonely and scared. I know this is just negative self talk and that it’s going to take time to rewire. But while I’m in it I just want to disappear. 

While all this is going on in my head I do have to take some stock of the positive changes I’ve made so far in the last 28 days. I’ve left an unhealthy relationship, I’ve been brushing my teeth twice a day, showering regularly, meditating, attending MA meetings, doing yoga, walking the dog, stopped using instagram, Tik Tok, and Facebook. But I just feel like it’s not enough, I keep thinking there’s more I should be doing (my parents also are adding pressure). I need to get a job but I have no idea what I want to do. It’s hard returning to my childhood home for the second time to get sober.

Anyway I think this is long enough and if you’ve read this far thank you. I’m going to stay sober for another 24 and hopefully things will get better. Love you all!",0

Then I got a job, the hours helped me cut down on smoking but the antisocial hours and stress had the opposite affect I worked there for a year before I quit smoking again. I lasted a month sober and when I fell of the wagon I went on a month long bender, coke, weed, hookers, the lot. I didn't go to work, I quit.

to put things into context before i went to rehab i used every. single. day. towards the end of it (before going to rehab) i would smoke from the time i woke up until i fell asleep m. during winter break i was looking at different mental institutions bc i didn’t have a lot of support from my parents in terms of my mental health and i knew i needed something bc i felt so shitty all the time - this resulted in me getting checked into you rehab which i totally did not expect. during that time, i got in some meds and it totally changed my life - i felt “normal” for the first time in 10 years, it was great. it was overall a good experience.

during rehab and after i started going to AA meetings (there isn’t a lot of MA meeting and I can’t find any DAM groups near me so this is the best option and i can relate to people there, for the most part). i was basically told constantly that i was an addict, but somehow i’m still not convinced - like ik it doesn’t have much to do with your drug of choice but rather the pattern you follow when using (using, binging, trying to stop, then failing). so in reality you can be addicted to anything.

my sponsor mentioned to me the other day that the “big book” literally says, “ if you want to test it, go out and use and see if you can have a normal reaction” or something along those lines. she explained that for some people they have to relapse a few times (especially people that are new to sobriety) before they get it…and she wasn’t telling me directly to use but she was pointing out that if it helps me figure things out, the book gives me that option.

on the one hand i want to try and test my theory but on the other hand i’ve been doing well and have seen my life improve through my sobriety- my relationship with my bf has gotten better, my grades in school are better, and i feel like things are more manageable but i keep asking my self if i smoked now, with the knowledge that i am on medication and have more motivation to stay sober, if that would be enough for me to smoke just one time and not let it control my life. i’m just thinking about it a lot and really wanted to write this out to sort my thoughts - comments are welcome and appreciated!",1

I am not happy about this. Was finally making strides before falling off. The anxiety got to be too much. I know that smoking can make my anxiety worse long term, but in the middle of it, all I can think about is making the anxiety stop. 

I had the best of intentions when I started with medical marijuana - just to take the edge of the anxiety. That morphed to “help” to “crutch” to “just because I feel like it.”

I have a problem. I need help. This is the first time I’ve told anyone this. Probably the first time I’ve truly acknowledged it. The best way to stop might start with me just getting rid of everything. The thought of doing that worsens the anxiety straight away. 

(Note that I’m in therapy, so the anxiety is being worked on. My shrink wants me to quit. I want to quit.)

I’m sorry if this is disjointed. I’m high and sad.

I realized weed itself wasn’t as addictive as I thought it was. The reason I was so addicted was because my mental health while sober was so bad that I needed the mask 24/7. 

Since quitting I’ve picked up my old hobbies. I started watching tv again. I started listening to podcasts again. I started playing favorite video games again. I started talking to my friends again. I started eating my favorite snacks again. 

It’s a reallocation of where you source the dopamine from. Before it was 100% from weed. Now it’s 5-10% from different activities that are way healthier and better in the long run. If anyone here has ADHD they can relate to this constant need of dopamine. 

First few days I couldn’t eat or sleep. I was blowing up on anyone in my daily life. I had suicidal thoughts. I was extremely hot or cold. I couldn’t socialize. My brain had a hamster wheel in it and I couldn’t stop intruding thoughts and anxiety. Appetite is back to normal and I can finally fall asleep in under an hour.

for the past two years of was like chronic, wake-n-bake, numb it all out, endless chain of smoke. i guess my life & the world around me felt like it was too much, and i just wanted to disappear completely. 

i remember feeling so stuck and depleted. every positive quality i had: compassion, creativity, and insight were so difficult to reach. when i was stoned, i couldn’t hold appropriate emotional space for my loved ones. i couldn’t make art joyfully or easily anymore: i struggled deeply to access the artistic skills i have practiced since i was 3 years old. i missed details, clues, visions, clouds in the sky, leaves on the ground, rocks on the path. cloudy, foggy, blurry, and overall a lack of clarity. 

quitting did not immediately make this better: in fact, the first weeks were even worse. i was angry, craving, nervous. i couldn’t tune out my inner thoughts: they came back hammering out a ridiculous staccato. my half-baked project ideas (started and abandoned while high) all jumped back into focus, and all my mistakes from the past two years paced circles in my mind. i couldn’t sleep or eat well, and i felt constantly and utterly bored by all sensory feelings for a couple weeks. depression, anxiety, and physical pain seemed sharper and harsher. i was not well during the detox. 

i said my regrets for the past, and did not hold on to guilt or shame. i know that the path ahead of me is clear as day, and is illuminated by the sacred agreements i make with myself. i have moved forward from past regret. i have turned to rituals that fill the space smoking did: i leave rocks by the tree i used to smoke next to. the alter of rocks grows each day i remain steady on my path. 

i did relapse once early on during a moment of deep weakness, but remembered that my goal isn’t purity, but it is right action. regrettable mistakes occur because we are human, but we must have the resolve to not repeat our mistakes. i affirm this each day: it is my main job to watch my mind like a hawk. i don’t want to miss a thought or a breathe. my experience of time is much slower & richer - this past month feels longer than the last 2 years combined. this really feels like a new beginning! i even made some art to commemorate this feeling of optimism surging within me. 

here are some things that are helping me: 

meditation. dream journaling. making art. a partner who is also sober. long-term vision. drinking enough water. eating food i cooked. sleeping long & deep. 

hope this helps! sending love & respect to all of you, at whatever point in the journey you are on. you can do this.",8

I’m no longer silent when something upsets me and instead am able to have a reasonable, adult conversation about it.

I would be lying if I said I didn’t crave the stuff however I know the consequences of withdrawal symptoms is not worth it in the end.

I feel like this entire process is a long therapy session in itself. We are the ones responsible for our futures, our outlooks, our actions. We are stronger than this plant. In the end it’s ourselves we need. Self-love is so much more important than we realize. We are doing ourselves and our loved ones a favor by loving who we are fully, just as we are. In the end “things won’t change until we do…”

And that included how I feel and the problems have in my life. I live in a foreign country alone for college and I’m on my 3rd year and socially things are not really going well for me, and it’s depressing to think about how I’m still this way after giving it times to make friends and form a support system here. I only started smoking heavily this year and it just kind of made me forget that I wasn’t really close to anyone here. 

The loneliness came back like a brick in my face as I started sobering up. I’m glad for it because it’s real and I want to deal with what’s real, and getting off weed has honestly just really improved my productivity and made me realize some other existential crises I have to deal with like whether I even want to stay in this country or find a different place. 

But yeah, my depression has really been worse, and the mood swings suck. I’ve been crying everyday since my withdrawal symptoms began. This is for the better though. Just wanted to share since I can’t really talk about this to anyone here.",7

I still have cravings here and there but have held strong. I used to vape nicotine heavy too, but quit a while ago, a bit before I quit smoking weed (it seemed relatively easy to quit then but I think it was just because I had weed to cope with the cravings).  The other day I was cleaning my closet and found a zero nicotine vape in my bag from the summer. I’ll say the act of smoking has always been somewhat relaxing to me I guess. When I found it, I hit it a few times and put it away. And since then I’ve been craving it and it’s kinda scary because I’m very dependent on things and I don’t want to fall back into the rabbit hole I was in smoking every day but at the same time ive just been craving to hit the 0 nic vape because there’s nothing on paper addictive about it, and the act of smoking in general used to be relaxing. Does anybody have advice? Should I throw it away or is it ok to use? If I do start using it, it is old and probably doesn’t have much left in it, and I don’t really think I’d buy another one, even if I wanted to I’m still under 21 and I’ve blocked all my former plugs (doubt they sell 0 nic vapes anyways).

I've tried quitting several times and struggled with weed as most of you have for a long time. Most recently it got so bad I was smoking 7 grams a day. This support group has been amazing and I am on week 3 and hoping it sticks this time. The longest I have gone in the past is 3 month. 

This is a little embarrassing but with the new found time I have become okay with where I am at with my recovery and put pen to paper and just wanted to share. I've never written anything before but wanted to title this one 'Leaves' because of how much support this sub has given me. I have never commented or posted before so here goes.... If even one person can relate and find this helpful that is all I ask.

**I take and take then take some more.** 

**I don't see colour, I don't see race. I don't discriminate.** 

**I numb the pain and make sure you come again.** 

**Bound by anger and tied to hate, I will haunt you for the rest of your days.**

**Do not try to escape there is only restraint.**

**To those who don't know me, addiction is the name.**

I've quit several times (6 months, 1 year, and 2 and half years most recently) and I always seem to forget about this... emotional detox. Every single thing I smoked away so I couldn't feel it? It didn't just dissappear into the void, I internalized it. And it sat there for months while I numbed the pain with weed. Now all that bottled up sadness, anger, and pain are DEMANDING to be felt and I have to just let it happen. This is always the worst part for me. The physical symptoms suck, but the mental side is so much harder. Has anyone else gone through this when you've quit?

I'm gonna keep crying it out, as that's the only thing I can do. And it'll make me tired enough to hopefully sleep. I know this is worth it, but fuck man I am so upset and sad tonight. I really need someone to tell me it's going to be okay.

I’ve struggled with admitting I have problem with thc for a while. 11 months ago, I decided to quit, and by the goodness of God, I was able to quit vaping high % medical pharmacy stuff cold turkey. I had been getting it from out of state since I live in a non legal state. I was doing great. I had the most successful year in my business and I was able to be clear-headed and free of that mental fog through the busy season, which meant I was able to bring in more money than ever before. 

Fast forward to 4 weeks ago. I went to pick up dinner four the family, and a weak moment made me stop at a local smoke shop to see what the delta 8 edible fuss was about. And here I am 4 weeks later, using edibles every day, and getting right back into that cycle of depression, shame, and guilt. My wife would be so pissed at me. It would be really bad. So I’ve kept it all to myself, and I absolutely hate the feeling of hiding this. It just makes things worse, not better for me. 

Last year, after quitting I finally decided that I needed to treat my ADHD again for the first time in like 25 years. So my Dr. has me on adderrall and I have to see her in about 5 weeks. I worry they will drug test me and I’ll lose that prescription which has absolutely helped me tremendously with focus and keeping my business running.

Overall, I’m just risking way too much for something that I don’t even really like. And I feel a little powerless to stop. I keep telling myself “one more week and then I’ll quit.” 🤦‍♂️ 

I feel God telling me I need to stop. I know I want to, but I’m just so afraid of not being able to and this consuming me again.

So I’ve (29F) been a heavy smoker for around 3 years now - I have smoked since I was around 19 but never as much as these last few years. 

I really want to detox as soon as possible because I have now realised the detriment that the bud has had on my life. I’m on my first night and I feel okay just been vaping all day but I’m scared of the side effects. 

Another reason I’m quitting is because I have a medical coming up for an amazing job I have been offered which includes a full drugs test and well I guess for me it feels like a new chapter - a much more sober one. It’s given me reason to do better and finally kick Mary Jane to the curb. The medical is in 8 weeks so I reckon I’ll be good.

I’m scared - what do I do to pass the time? Every night was usually just a smoke sesh and now I’m a bit like now what? 
I just watched the tinder swindler and gotta admit it’s the first time I’ve really watched something and taken it all in without a blurry brain.

TLDR at the bottom.

I'm quite the veteran when it comes to starting and stopping the whole weed thing.

Real quick, here's the breakdown of my history for your awareness:

Before 17 y/o - Weed Free

17-24 y/o - Pure Weed Dependence, Addiction; hopeless battles of trying to quit or gain control. Dark times.

25 y/o - Went 8 months Weed-Free (drastic shift in confidence and mindset) & I also demonstrated a high sense of control over weed. I created this rule of only smoking after I completed long-term goals. Things that took months. My life transformed this year. My health, money, and overall well being reached new heights.

26 y/o - Went the entire year weed-free (massive milestone, crazy!)

27-29 y/o - I'd flip flop between being completely weed-free for months, and then go full-on binge mode. In the times when I was weed-free, things were great. Anytime I decided to go binge-mode, things would begin to slowly fall apart. Luckily I'd always get my act together before full self-destruction. This is something Im actually proud of. Cause before, 1 month would become 6 months, would become 2 years. Thus, 2-3 months weed-free and 1 month weed-binge was a drastic improvement, ratio wise.

The Present - I was weed free for about 2 months when I decided to light one. This inevitably turned into a month long binge. In the process I neglected everthing and everyone. Which I know isn't a weed thing, it's a ""me"" thing. However, it seems that the version of me that shows up powerfully in life is the version of me that really doesnt care to smoke, and doesnt need to.

I really do feel like I'm trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. As if I'm SUPPOSED to be able to control my marijuana use. Like that's the mark of someone cool and has their shit together. And it's also embarrassing to just acknowledge that I ""can't control my weed use.""

However, the truth is I dont even like smoking weed daily like that. Or even weekly.

Especially after going a full year weed-free back in 2018, I've learned to really enjoy myself and my life independent of marijuana and it's ""benefits"". But especially WITHOUT it's hindrances.

That said, it wasn't just a matter of not smoking that created this joy. It's cultivating a fulfilling lifestyle, mentality, and emotional fortitude (ALONG w/ limiting toxic habits like incessant weed smoking), that really has me enjoy my life independent of weed.

I think coming from the stoner culture, I still have this belief that ""weed is dope and ought to be a part of one's life. There's really no good reason not to. It's so great!""

And so the idea of choosing to be someone that DOESNT smoke sounds...like...wrong? Or too uptight? As if there's no good justification to NOT smoke weed. Cause weed is ""just so good"". Which is a stupid way to make a serious life decision, I now admit.

Or even worse, the notion that I cant smoke because I'm an addict that cant control it. That's even worse. Like I'm a loser or some shit. But if anything, a loser is someone that doesnt make right minded decisions and instead continues down pathways that clearly dont fuckin work.

And so I'd try to keep weed around because 1) I believe I ought to like it cause ""its so great"" and 2) to prove that I can control it and I'm not a loser addict.

But, piercing through all that noise, I cant help but acknowledge the dramatic difference between the version of me that doesnt smoke versus the version of me that does. And Im almost certain the reason I try and keep weed around is because I think I'm supposed to (group acceptance).

Something just DOESNT quite resonate w me and weed. There's always been a sense of guilt, shame, and mis-alignment with it. The feeling is that smoking JUST ISNT ME. But I keep trying to force it. And at the same time, I resist the reality that it JUST ISNT ME.

Can I do it? Yea.

I can even appreciate it. Definitely.

But there's something about keeping it around that just doesn't resonate. Like I'm trying to keep something around that I've outgrown. Like, that chapter's over man. Let's move on. Stop trying to hold on. And better yet, stop recreating this pattern of pain and neglect. ESPECIALLY the neglect of others. Namely my girlfriend, my family, my business clients.

It. Just. Doesnt. Make. Sense.

ANYWAYS.

I'm 2 days clean since my most recent dumbass binge. lol.

The withdrawal symptoms are minimal, but theyre there.

Fluctuating energy, dry mouth, pent up energy, shortness of breath, funky sleep schedules, random fatigue. I look forward to being a couple weeks in, where my natural rhythms and such return to normal. In due time.

Anyways, appreciate those who read this far. Hope youre doing well.

TLDR: Im 2 days clean since my last binge. Withdrawal symptoms are minimal, but still suck. Look forward to them being gone in a couple weeks. IDK why I keep forcing myself to keep weed around. I clearly do mountains better when Im just doin me, no weed required. At what point do I just stop being an idiot with my life and move the frick on? lmao",7

Somehow there has been increasing distance between us since the time I stopped smoking with them and that has been really hard on me rather than quitting.

My S.O. told me the other day that she's never known me sober, and we've known each other for 8 years. That really made me sit back and think about it; why I'm still smoking so heavily, what do I actually get out of it other than spent money, and whether I'm still trying to hide from reality the same way I was 20 years ago when I started. I asked her what she thought it would change about me, and she said she doesn't know. That's the kicker, though, because I don't know, either.

Either way, I'm thinking it might be time to consider a change in lifestyle, if for no other reason than to pull back the veil and face reality with no buffer for the first time in two decades.

Firstly, thank you everyone here, this community has helped me SO much through these first 40 days.

During this time I've been contemplating a particular aspect of the quitting process that gets mentioned here a lot and wanted to share my thoughts with you all as I'd love to know what you think and hopefully it'll help some people. 

There's this idea that if we stay off weed for long enough then at some point our brain will have reset chemically, have started producing dopamine in a normal way and we'll finally feel happy and normal again.

I think it's great to keep these neuroscientific ideas in mind however I've also realised how important it is to remember that what's normal for one isn't what's normal for another. Normal for me was rarely happy so I've learned not to expect it to be that way since quitting and it's made the journey MUCH easier.

For me, quitting made me realise how the entire abusive side of my relationship with weed from age 14 was about some deep shit that I now have to face head on. So for me the clarity I've gained in sobriety has come with some harsh truths about the work I need to do on myself and in my life, this has been the hardest part of the process. 

I used to find happiness getting high. It seems to me that the challenge of life as a human, that I shirked all those years ago when I started smoking, is not only to find healthy, enriching or at least non-destructive things that make me happy but just as importantly to make peace with not being happy all the time. Going back to the idea of 'what is normal?' there is one thing I'm pretty sure isn't, which is happiness being as simple as smoking a fat spliff.

Even though it's fucking hard and I still miss weed a lot I'm so glad to be on this journey becoming someone who isn't a slave to any substance. Taking the time and doing whatever work is required to find happiness in health, freedom and reality and facing the hardships of life with a clear mind.

For those of you early on in the process, it does get easier! For me the initial 48 hours were tough and from then until about day 25-30 it was fucking awful (with a couple of decent days here and there). But remember your journey will be unique. Take it easy, exercise, meditation and affirmations all helped me and if your mental health is something you've experienced difficulties with in the past don't put off getting therapy. It will help!

Finally, please be kind to yourself. If you're having a bad day remember that what your doing is NOT easy. It's ok to be struggling and feel like you can't do it, but you can, I believe in you!

Now my anxiety is back so bad I can’t smoke cigarettes anymore (I know cigs are bad and I would like to quit those as well) the cigs helped me a lot the first 2 times I quit to give me something to smoke especially if I was around people who were smoking weed. But the last few days whenever I smoke it sky rockets my heart rate and blood pressure and it’s very scary. I went to the ER last year when I quit cause I couldn’t control my heart rate. They told me I was perfectly healthy and had a good heart, my anxiety was just so bad at the time. Anyone else dealt with a spike in withdrawals after you thought they were mostly over?

Stopped that substance a few days ago and yesterday my buddy offered me his vape and I hit it because it looked good. Ofc I got blasted and even a bit paranoid but it solidified inside me that it’s not something I want to feel 24/7. Instead, I got used to sobriety and preferred that. 

That night I killed a bottle of wine as I have done almost nightly for a year (I was abstinent from wine for a few days too). Felt like shit and told myself nope, don’t need this either. 

This morning after shaking of the night’s debaucheries, I went outside and it’s beautiful weather (Florida). I was able to smell scents a lot better and suddenly my feel good just skyrockets….and doesn’t dip back down like it used to when I’d try quitting and felt that initial kick. 

This time my mood refuses to collapse and I’m staying naturally high off of life and man does it feel good. I think I broke through the barrier. Granted due to CO poisoning of my nerves, it’ll take a bit longer to regain full nasal senses of smell. But it’s been over an hour and I have yet to feel less than stupendous. 

Like others have said: trying it again made my body push one last time and said “no sir, it’s time to let it go.” Everyone is different, and I’m rooting for you all. I was stoned for 4 years and drunk every night for 1.

I started smoking at 14 and became a daily user at 18. Most recently, I was smoking about an eighth a day. I had so many reasons to quit:

1. I spent about $1000 USD on weed a month. For reference, I was making $2400 a month. My bank account was constantly overdrafted and I would choose weed over food.
2. I was skipping work 1-3 days a week to smoke weed.
3. I continually canceled social plans to smoke and lost friends because of it.
4. My last relationship ended because of it.
5. I want to have hobbies again.
6. I want to face my trauma.
7. I don't like feeling powerless to a substance.
8. It was awkward having to go outside to smoke at friends', my parents', etc.
9. I couldn't read a book or game because my attention span was shit.
10. It made me a worse therapist because I would lose track of what people were saying.

Being on day 11 makes me so proud of myself, but I must admit that it has been... a nightmare. On day four, twenty years of trauma came rushing back and hit me like a freight train. I'm on 11 medications now (my usual regimen is 5) to deal with anxiety, panic attacks, and nightmares.

I know it'll get easier soon. But I'm also aware that my trauma work is just beginning, now that I'm not numbed out all the time.

Been free from abuse for over a year now which is peaceful, developed CPTSD.

Since my abuser was out of my life I have reduced smoking to a couple of puffs a day (I'm very sensitive to it), then I always decide I'm going to quit and I manage about a month. Most recent break was just over 5 weeks and I just started smoking again, I just felt miserable and hate myself and my life and I just want to feel euphoric again.

But I do get what looks like manic episodes sometimes and weed does make this worse, few months ago I was suddenly talking to anyone and everyone so much my mouth was dry. I was convinced I was going to release this research on some ideas I had brewing that'd get me a Nobel prize. And I said all kinds of deluded crap feeling like I knew everything.

I since feel embarrassed but I miss the confident me. I'm autistic and I have ADHD so I wish I loved socialising the way I do in an episode. I have OCD too and my therapist recommended after my last session to pursue a full course of OCD therapy. I feel like all my mental illness + neurodivergence makes it so difficult to be sober, its just too much to deal with even when I know what to do life is just so painful and exhausting.

After my last session I decided to finally take my therapists advice even though I'm scared of going sober. I referred to a drug support service because if I'm honest I know I'm addicted and I can't successfully quit long term by myself. I'm scared and I feel ashamed, I know I should be proud I made the referral. I would say it gives me some relief and hope that I might be guided successfully but I am sceptical that they would understand me individually and suggest things I haven't yet tried.",19

Because how else better to get to know someone than to go smoke up by the river and just chat then get some food? Welp, I’m now trying to quit and have realized that I don’t know what to do with people without weed as an option.., I feel that it took the pressure off of actually trying to find something to occupy our time in our boring little town. 

What do normal people do when they hang out? 

Granted a lot of this feeling like there’s nothing to do has a lot tied to my smoking habits and never developing hobbies throughout my teen years. My whole persona was “stoner chick”. I think this will get easier with time, but I know I need to make (real) friends in order to stay away from weed and any advice would be appreciated:)",1

I wish I was one of the people that could reassure the folks who are just starting to get sober that everything will be A-okay. But unfortunately I'm in need of a little support myself right now. I'm 62 days into sobriety after a 16 year smoking spree. It's still really hard for me 2 months in. My sleep schedule is all messed up still. Even when I do get sleep, I wake up tired. Been having terrible dreams. I've been really depressed and can't seem to get back on track. 

Granted, I may be an outlier, considering I get fairly bad seasonal depression annually and am prescribed medication for anxiety and depression that I'm giving a try all at the same time that I made this massive lifestyle change to abstain from getting high. Hard to know what to attribute each circumstance to. 

I'm doing the best I can. I've been consistent with weekly therapy, but most days it's really difficult to get out of bed. Even going to my fridge can take such effort for me. I'm going into a more intensive therapy program in a couple of weeks, and I guess I just wanted to vent a little bit. Thanks for reading!",9

That my addiction to weed would no longer leave me in a zombie-like state

That my addiction to weed would no longer control how my days went  

That my addiction to weed would no longer contribute to my anxiety, whether it be social, circumstantial, or random

That my addiction to weed would no longer take percentages of my hard earned money

I’ve made it 30 days. I had smoked since I was 14, the majority of the time everyday. People ask me why I quit…because it controlled me, I couldn’t control it. But now I can, because I’ve finally found self love. I can read without my mind trailing off. I can get out of bed every morning and face life head on. I can dream normal dreams. I can have a conversation with a stranger without having an internal panic attack. 
To reward myself, I’ve purchased a ring.. something I always thought someone else would give me. I realize now I need to be that person for myself. I have never worn rings, but I need a constant reminder of my commitment I have made to myself.  Not only regarding my addictions, but total self love. I deserve it ❤️🥰",189

That's awesome! I'll tell you though, it gets even better as time goes on. The benefits are exponential over time. 

For me, I was cursed with being able to function at 75% at my most stoned - so in other words I could get away with being high a lot. Why did I like getting high? To run from my emotions. I could go to work high and present in meetings, but underneath it all I was fucking with my brain in numerous ways - emotional stability, sleep, and most of all, short term memory. I was the king of writing things down - otherwise I'd have no idea. I was always misplacing my keys and walking into rooms forgetting why I was there. At one point I was at a dinner party and started talking and halfway through talking forgot where I was going with my story and sorta stopped talking. I remember my friends glossing over like nothing happened, but man it was embarrassing. 

Two years later, and with each day my short term memory seems to be getting better - and that has meant my life has gotten better. I can pay attention better, random details come easy to me, names are much less of an issue. I'm performing better at work and I'm confident about it - which means less time stressing and less time compensating for fuzzy memory. 

So I part this advice to you all - if you're at a couple of weeks - be excited to be at a couple of years soon enough. If you're lurking on this sub - here's some benefits I've gotten out of cutting out weed beyond cognitive improvement:

Better + actual sleep - which means I'm now an early riser who has time to get things done before work

My perception of life + the world around me is less fuzzy

Soooo much more free time 

Learning how to relax without substances 

Emotional resiliency - not running away from negative emotions and able to deal with the harsh truths of the world

Less calories 

Saving a bit of money",64

It’s actually insane how the brain can do this. With that being said, I need help or support. I feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone I’m close to, partly because I’m ashamed, but also because they just don’t/won’t get it.

Well today was absolutely awful. Literally worried myself sick, just wanted to curl into a ball and cry. I think maybe having a bit of a hangover started me off wrong but I still feel so anxious even at night now. I also cut caffeine several days ago so I’m wondering if I’m also withdrawing from that and the double withdrawal plus hangover just did me in, not sure.

I’m really struggling, why can it be so bad one day and not the day before, I don’t understand it. I just wanna run away and disappear sometimes it just feels too much to handle. 

One thing I do know is I will not be smoking again, this drug has destroyed my critical thinking skills and rationalization it seems. So I’m trying to focus on that, sobriety, one day at a time like everyone says.

Weed has basically been a wall that keeps my depression, PTSD, and anxiety at bay. After a long day of work, I come home, get a good bit of more work done, and end my day with a bong or blunt. It’s very odd to describe, but for those few hours, all the weight on my shoulders is gone. All the bad relationships, the abuse I’ve receive, dead people, and constant panic go away. I’m finally able to smile again. I am able to talk to people without my paranoia driving me insane. I’ve tried medication, therapy, and all sorts of other methods.

I'm on day 2 now, don't feel that good, but this pain is a reminder to myself, how much weed takes away from your life. Good thing about being sober for a few months, is that you learn certain behaviors, which can be used again after your relapse.

From 15-18 I smoked daily. Smoked my way through High school. Smoked my way through college. 

Smoked on and off during university. Continued smoking on and off until now, I'm 33 years old (heavy smoker for 6-8 months, then stop for 1-2 months, rince and repeat). 

When I have weed, I smoke it. I can't have weed and not smoke. I can't smoke ""moderatly"". So, obviously, I have to not have weed and not smoke. 

I've been sober for 2 months now, and it's the same story as always. I have (minor) ups and moderate lows. Is that ""normal""? I think smoking that much weed that young messed up my brain development in some ways. Is it hormonal? Did it permanently fucked some my neuromodulation? 

Today I have all the reasons in the world to be ""happy"". I have a hot wife, 2 lovely young healthy kids, I'm healthy, I have a great job making a lot of money, huge house, no debt, etc. 

Still... in my best days, I feel ""meh"". I honestly cannot find, on a micro level, a reason to not be happy. But here I am, mostly kind-of miserable, mad, softly angry at everything. Nothing crazy, just ""meh"", but mostly ""meh"" on the depressed side of things. 

Maybe I need therapy? But I have been depressed before and it's not that. It's just... ""meh"", everything sucks. I know weed is not the answer. I don't know man. I wish I could just be happy, excited about something... Growing up with weed made me uninterested in everything. I just wanted to sit and smoke. Now that I don't smoke, I just sit. 

Anyway... I hope they study this drug a lot more, so that we know more about the effect on the developping brain. Maybe some of you will recognize yourself in some ways with my experience. 

Don't give up, don't smoke.

EDIT: I have read all of your comments. You guys are great, honestly. It feels good to read this. I'm hopefull. I'll be patient. I'll start working out again. When I smoke, I eat like an animal at night. When I stop I don't, so I'll continue eating well. I'll read on self-help. If in a few months, I still feel ""meh"", I'll go see a therapist. Most of all, I won't smoke again. Today I woke up and told myself I'd be happy. It helps already. Thank you!",297

I'm 25 years old now and ever since I smoked weed for the first time I wanted more of it. Until last summer I didn't really have a lot of people to get it from and I'd never buy it on the street so I'd just smoke whenever I could. But last June I started dating somebody who has some problems with addiction and I got free access to weed.

We started smoking maybe 5-6 blunts a week but soon we went up to 5-6 on weekdays and 10+ on weekends. Whenever I wasn't at his place I'd get high all day at home, calling in sick at work, watching Netflix and playing stupid games on my phone. Literally no one knows about this and I'm ashamed I did that.

We'd find excuses aaaall the time...""we deserve it, it was a rough day"" or ""it's 7pm and we haven't smoked so it's okay"". We've been talking about reducing 100 times but never ever did it. Last week we said we'd try to quit during the week and it worked for one day until we went back to it. I had massive sleep problems and when I was alone on Thursday I smoked to be able to sleep but instead I found myself in a horrible panic attack.

I think something inside of me changed there. I suddenly realised that I do have a problem. It seriously felt like: ""Wake the fuck up! What are you doing?????"" Went on reddit and found this sub. I didn't even finish my blunt and only saw that 2 days later. I never want to touch this shit again. I'm being 100% serious about this and I know I can do it. I'm strong enough.

I think I've always struggled with reality ever since I was a teenager. I've never really had healthy coping mechanism and I tend to deal with problems by avoiding them. I struggle with controlling my emotions and weed just made that worse. When I was high I'd have great plans in my head of how I'd change my life and become the person I want to be but when I wasn't high I always told myself that I'll start soon, when I'm ready. 

I'm sick of making these excuses, I'm sick of feeling down. I'm sick of waking up and feeling terrible in the first few hours. I'm sick of getting headaches when I smoke too much. I'm sick of not being able to focus on what I'm doing when I'm high and instead living in my head. I'm sick of thoughts spiraling and making me feel even worse. I'm sick of feeling exhausted because my lungs are damaged. I'm sick of not being able to wait until I get home just so I could get high. I'm sick of being ok with being bored. I'm sick of telling myself that I don't have a problem deep down knowing that I do. I'm sick of the dizzyness I felt when I was high, sometimes so bad I'd almost faint. I'm sick of having horrible sleep and not feeling rested. I'm sick of panicking because what if I run out of weed? 

I want to be healthy, I want to experience reality with all my senses, unfiltered. I want to be in control of what I'm doing. I want to deal with my problems the way I should be dealing with them. I want to live life to its fullest, with all the world has to offer. 

Drugs don't belong in my life anymore. The positive feelings they give us are illusions. I will not fall for them anymore. I'm done with this shit.",14

I am wondering how the creative process will be different for me when my head is clean, since there has never been a period of time in my life after age 12 when THC wasn't in my system.

Artist folks, what happened with your creative process when you quit, and how has it changed over time? Was making art also a trigger for you after you quit, and if so, how did you deal with that?",17

I’m newly sober from alcohol and my sponsor and therapist both are telling me to be gentle and know that it may be hard to quit both at once and staying alcohol free is way more important (because it’s literally killing me). I worry moderation is not something I know. I’ve done it before but then waded back into using so much I was never not high. I know moderation isn’t possible for me sometimes. But is it possible? This week I am trying to not use during the day , with the understanding that I’m much better off with weed than wine - same with reaching for a Kit Kat than the vodka. Anyways I guess I wondered if anyone here has dealt with going sober from alcohol and then moving slowly off weed? I know I’m a better person sober, I know when I’m not high I get work done. But I don’t know how to be not high. The weed stuff is set away and not to be used until I am done with the day. But right now before I go to work I want to grab the bag and take it with me, just in case I’ll “be ok” to get high. And as an artist I fear I can’t be creative without being high…

All the things one reads about here or if they do a google search on withdrawal.  But here’s the rub, I was still having those issues at day 30.  It was not until around 40 days that I could sleep,  didn’t have constant headaches and wasn’t sweating like crazy when sleeping or having weird dreams. But around that 40 day mark I experienced some real depression and anxiety and I had a hard time motivating.  I did feel somewhat more clear headed but still fuzzy from time to time.  Tomorrow is day 67 for me.  I have a headache whike I write this.  I am still struggling with motivation but it’s like I am finally waking up.  I do have some “sad” and anxious days.

My previous posts were related to withdrawal, quitting, t-breaks and moderation. I started getting into edibles heavily when I started working from home in 2020. At first, it was just something fun to do to pass the time. Two years later and I believe that today I am finally acknowledging that I am addicted to weed. My mood, memory, focus and appetite have all begun to suffer because of weed. What was first a fun thing to do, has now become something that I do every single day, without fail. I am ashamed and embarrassed that I have allowed myself to get to this point. I am saddened because I hardly recognize myself anymore. I know that I MUST give this up, but I am terrified. Sadly, weed has become a source of comfort. Bad mood, get high. No appetite, get high. Bored, get high. I hate this person that I have become. Yesterday at work, I found myself feeling nauseous, dizzy and extremely warm from the lack of appetite and accompanying nausea that comes from not eating. As I found myself hovering over the toilet, while my manager consoled me, that was when I realized that I need to get it together. If my health is not strong enough for me to even be at work, there is a major problem. Right now, I’m in bed, wondering how I am going to get through the day. Last night was my first night in months without getting high, and even though I feel like shit right now, I’m trying to keep focused on the end goal. I’m going to take a nap, and when I wake up, I’m going to flush my stash. Tomorrow is my 29th birthday and I deserve better from myself. I’m going to get sober and STAY sober. Thank you ALL for being such a positive and safe space for people like us to feel seen. I don’t know what I would do without this sub. Please wish me luck in this journey. I have a lot of work to do but I deserve to give myself a chance at being a better version of myself.

Video games, listening to music, watching movies are all perfect examples of activities where especially early on you’ll be taunted with the fact that they’re more enjoyable while high.

I like to cook, and I sure as hell know that mincing an onion while high or drunk is a bad idea. As long as I don’t cave into the stupid idea of actually doing that, it seems to help.

Programming is a good example, especially when you’re learning something new or using a lot of critical thinking. Otherwise if I’m stoned I’ll just go “I’m too impaired, I’d rather do this sober”, which of course never happens because once I am, I withdrawal, get depressed and tired :P

Fixing cars, something you should ALWAYS do sober.

Every time you get high, you’ll say to yourself, I wish I could fix my Camaro, or I wish I could use a sewing machine. And hopefully you’ll be smart enough NOT to pursue those under the influence.

I have a lot of ""reasons why"" to smoke - it makes me feel less anxious, I hate my job a lot less, it makes being home alone all day less boring. It's easier to do chores, it's easier to regulate my appetite. 

But, it's hurting my wallet (legal state = legal taxes lolsob), and more importantly, my partner has told me multiple times that she wishes I would stop. I didn't smoke when we met, and while I'm not necessarily someone she dislikes when I'm high, I'm not the person she fell in love with. 

So, it's time to get serious about quitting. I care about my partner more than I care about weed; I care about building a sustainable future for myself, which is hard when every spare dime goes to weed (and when I could get fired for smoking at all, much less smoking on the clock). 

It's day 1, and we have someone coming over today so it'll be easier to abstain. I've got my supplies locked in a cabinet, and I have no money with which to buy more weed lol. 

I'm trying to approach sobriety like a science experiment - what feels good about not smoking? What feels bad? How am I better when I'm not smoking, and how am I worse? Who notices that I'm sober, and who doesn't? When do I feel cravings or the urge to smoke? Why is weed something I want to use every day? 

I'm happy there is a community of people who have done this before. I'm hoping some of you fine folks have tips for distracting myself during long, boring WFH jobs.",11

I think it just all comes from motivation + perception. **I have never stopped on my own before**, I always had to take a vacation abroad for a few weeks, then I could hold it for a few months until I relapsed. 


This time was different, I had a lot of self hate and a lot of hate towards the drug, for making me this unstable. I was fully confident that I would stop, and I haven't had many cravings at all, and have refused a joint 2 times now in friend groups. 

I welcomed the withdrawals like in a ""try me then"" way, because I was so angry with myself and the drug. Before I used to dread not smoking at night as it was my comfort and I was really scared of the withdrawal depression and anxiety.  


I think it all comes down to your motivation + your perception of weed, the few times I have had cravings, I can only think of the anxiety, paranoia and how weak and vulnerable feelings I had. I think I am actually done for good now with this shit. I have gotten what I needed from the herb. 

I feel good at day 30, more confident, more clear headed. I am slowly starting to recognize myself. and there isn't really any withdrawals at all, my mind is just not 100% yet, it is getting sharper and more clear everyday. I think I will be 100% at around month 3.

Why would anyone need to quit weed? I mean, it’s ONLY weed! There’s so much positive PR out there especially now that it’s becoming increasingly decriminalized and legal: “It’s medicinal! It will help you relax, sleep better, pain, stress, menstrual cramps, migraines …the list goes on. 

I don’t deny those claims. I personally am thankful that it helped me get off alcohol. Perhaps it did help me with those other things … but ONLY in the beginning! It took me a couple of years to realize I had simply replaced alcohol with weed. As with any addiction, it hindered me in life. 

If you’re like me and lurking on this sub wondering if you should quit, ask yourself if you’re addicted. Have you tried to cut back and failed? Do you panic when your supply is low? Do you not do things you should be doing because you’re high? Have friends and family commented on your use? 

As far as addictions go, perhaps it’s one of the less malicious ones. However, an addiction is an addiction. The difference it will make in your life to get rid of addictions is huge. 

I’m only on day 775 with alcohol, day 45 with weed, and day 30 with tobacco - but I can’t believe how much my mental health and life is changing/has changed for the better. 

I’m so glad I joined this sub. If you’re wondering if you have a problem, you probably do. Quit. Replace your bad habits with good ones. Start becoming your best self, one day at a time.",89

I've already gave up alcohol 11 weeks ago, now I am ready to leave weed for good.

Think of all the BENEFITS;

\- All them dreams to recall (Your dreams when stopping a substance will go sky-high)

\- More money in my pocket

\- More time for work and healthy activities

\- Less and milder intrusive thinking (it is frequent and severe when abusing weed)

Also Think of all the CONSQUENCES;

\- I will often be broke when spending too much on it, not saving enough cash for the reminder of the month to get by, and that is extremely emotionally distressing.

\- The intrusive thoughts of hotties saying the r-word will kick my in the nuts far harder if using drugs are involved, I will bet you that. It's not a coincidence they magically appear easier to control when sober and have far more rational/quicker thinking.

2022-02-15 03:35:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ssybuw/cannabis_use_disorder/,cannabis use disorder,"Hi everyone! I thought I'd share a nugget of info with you all in the hopes it will help. 

From what I have gathered (I'm one of those people who research shit extensively for fun lol) cannabis use disorder is a condition that affects people who become dependent on cannabis. 

The thing about cannabis is people (clearly not us but people) can use it in moderation, regularly, and not become addicted. 

The issue for people like myself is I use cannabis as a crutch for my mental health problems. Mental health is a problem that is often silent to others. We feel ashamed of admitting that we struggle with things like anxiety and depression. Due to a social stigma that is only recently actually getting attention and that has existed for thousands of years, we don't get help. 

Then, we met weed. Weed made us giggly, less anxious and we were able to put our guard down. That's a big relief for people like myself with mental illness. So we start to lie to ourselves. Cannabis helps my insomnia/anxiety/depression/anger issues. But it doesn't. It masks them.

When we all made the decision to come away from cannabis, many, especially myself, didn't realise it would mean working on those parts of ourselves that resulted in us smoking daily in the first place. 

To truly stay away, we need to tackle why we approached it in the first place. 

Now, therapy is expensive. Not everyone can access it or feel ready to do so, probably why we are all here with a substance use problem. But I've been in therapy since I was 7, I know the game, and I can help. 

Sit down with a pen and paper. We are going to draw a cycle of our use. This cycle will show trigger >> resulting thoughts >> action (buying weed) >> result (temporary relief) and then will go back to trigger. 
It should look like a circle. 

Look at this closely, and try to spot where would be a great place for you to disrupt and break this cycle. When you have thought of this, draw an arrow from where you will disrupt your cycle and write how. 

Things that I do to disrupt my cycle are: screaming into a pillow, beating up my pillow, breathing deeply and practicing the 54321 grounding technique (5 things u see, 4 u hear, 3 u can touch, 2 u can smell, 1 u can taste), splashing my face with water (great one, activates deep dive reflex, a evolutionary tactic that lowers heart rate calms you) 

Most of all though, do a cycle that represents what leads to the thoughts that lead you to use. Figuring out the issue, the reason you actually use, will give you a whole new motivation to quit. 

My motivation to quit, for example, is I need to learn how to manage my emotions ON MY OWN. no drugs! Messing my already corrupted brain chemistry up! I need to face the shit that's traumatised me, head on. Not smoking just to temporarily make that pain go, I need to let the fuck go. So do you. Why are you carrying such heavy baggage everywhere you go dude? Draw some cycles and get to the bottom of it. 

If anyone wants to know, the technique I've suggested is used in CBT therapy, a behavioural therapy designed to help people recognise the repeating patterns in their lives and fucking destroy them. 

Thanks for reading if you have done this far, you've shown a dedication to quitting! You should be so proud. Big well done if you try what I've suggested. It takes a lot of courage to confront yourself so I'm very proud of you, whoever you are.",567

I'm now 3 weeks sober again... It's harder this time but I think it's finally worth it.

This isn't a pity post nor is it begging for help, it's a realisation of how hard it can be. I'd say I lead a good life with ups and downs like most, I've had some great experiences in life and very loving parents.

Without going into the grit I had a traumatic experience that's never left me, only my family and some friends back then know about. I finally met someone many years later who I thought I could move forward with quit fully. and bringing her child up as my own, doing what I thought was the right thing, good home, good life and finally saying yes to the extra things. This was then all stripped away through her manipulation of myself over a 2 year period. After the breakup a promise was broken after a month and my access to my step child was taken, with no legal entitlement I was alone again. 

I fell hard again, a few weeks back at my parents trying to piece my life back together just turned into a game of how quickly can I get my own place so that I didn't have to hide how broken I was and most importantly how quickly I'd become a daily smoker again.

I'd never being an anxious person before, depression sure but anxiety this was a new beast. I started to fall deep and found all I cared about was sitting in a smokey bubble protected by four walls on a night. 

A good amount of time has passed now and I've worked on myself, the anxiety through talking has mostly passed. I've found a great partner and having open conversations about her life and my own has led me to quiting again.

I'm now 3 weeks in and it's harder than before. The dreams and nightmares are back, emotional outbreaks of crying and mood swings, the taboo topic of a reduced sex drive. It's a fucking rollercoaster. I know I'm doing it for the right reasons, I'd hit a wall that couldn't be climbed and now I'm slowly but painfully getting over it. 

I don't care if anyone reads this I'm just glad I've written it. Out of my own research I now see weed as an emotional bandage with more negatives than positives for myself.

Weed can't solve this. Weed has been worsening my PTSD symptoms, my quality of sleep is declining, and every time I smoke thinking maybe I'll do something creative I lose it. I don't want to write when I'm high even if I tell myself that's what I'll do.

Back again for Day 1,"I have had an issue with cannabis since junior high school, and am 32 years old now. My addiction issues run deep. I first understood I needed to quit when I was 17, but that never happened. I quit for a few months here and there throughout my 20's, but never for more than 1 year. These quitting attempts were also marked with using alcohol heavily on the weekends as a replacement for cannabis.

Up until Late October 2021 I was a daily cartridge user, going through up to 2 carts per week. I quit for 2 months but slipped up on Christmas eve with an edible. I don't drink anymore, and felt like something to take the edge off of the most stressful move of my life. I moved from a 3rd story apartment to a house and I have never been so sore in my life. 

About a week later I bought some flower and a pipe and began to smoke everyday. It has now been almost 2 months of daily cannabis use and today was the day I decided to quit. I took Monday and Tuesday off of work to help with those first few shitty days.

Right now I have a strong urge to smoke, with nausea, anxiety and existential dread sprinkled in. Hopefully I'll be able to get some sleep tonight.

Just posting here to keep myself accountable. I am not sure how many attempts I have made to quit, but I can tell you that I was not successful because I was not focusing on the right things. Focusing on abstinence only is not very effective, because the underlying issues in my life are not going to magically resolve themselves. Time to focus on my recovery and work on the man I wish to be. No more hiding in a cloud of smoke.

I had tried to quit weed dozens of times over several years before I managed to cut it out of my life. It took reaching rock bottom (and revisiting it a few times) to get myself to stop. Since then, I’ve come to appreciate the freedom that sobriety gives me, and I’ve been slowly but surely turning my life into one that’s worth getting up in the morning for.

Long story short, I’ve smoked a few times over the last few months after 17 months of sobriety. Almost always because it was offered to me. I’m currently road tripping through Florida with a fellow traveler, who happens to quite enjoy the devil’s lettuce. Weed is always around, and generally speaking it hasn’t been too hard to say no because I enjoy being functional and don’t want to deal with the come down/withdrawal. But I have smoked a few times, enjoying it a little more each time as I get reaccustomed to the effects. 

Mentally, I’m not addicted. Physically, my body is starting to get cold, clammy and sweaty as last week’s bad decision makes its way out of my system. This didn’t happen last time. My addiction is progressing (against my will)!  I don’t have any immediate plans to smoke again, but I do have this fantasy of enjoying a puff or two once we reach Key West. I know where this can lead. And I know I need to quit while I’m ahead.

Humbly,

2022-02-14 20:24:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ssqqfz/quitting_weed/,Quitting weed,"I have never posted on Reddit but here we go. I have been smoking weed since high school and recently decided to quit at 23 due to severe panic attacks and a medical diagnosis. I smoked everyday multiple times a day for all that time which I’m embarrassed to admit but is necessary for the sake of the story. I started to reduce the amount I smoked towards the end of college for obvious reasons (finding job / moving back home), which was definitely helping, but my recent panic attacks led me into a downward spiral that caused me to think I had an underlying condition. I got checked up, MRIs, doctors appointments and all with all clean visits besides a sinus infection that was causing headaches and an unintentional discovery of a cavernous malformation which is a cluster of blood vessels in your brain. At the time of discovery, I was extremely worried about this malformation and knew that smoking would exacerbate my anxiety and potential for more panic attacks. Doctors reassured me that these malformations are actually quite common (1-200 people) and are rarely dangerous. I don’t know if the malformation was a wake up call but I could not seem to smoke weed again without those feelings of paranoia arising and thinking about this thing in my head. I made the decision on January 31st of this year to quit smoking weed and start a new life for myself. It just seemed like the right time for me personally to give up something that had given me so much “joy” when I was younger. I have had your typical withdrawal symptoms that you can find other people talk about on other forums but to a greater degree in some aspects. My withdrawal has been much more physical symptoms than mental which I have been surprised about. When I decided to quit, I started having small muscle twitches in my calves, body aches, and night sweats which once again led me to believe I had an undiagnosed medical condition that the doctors were not able to identify the first time around. I saw another post about someone with a very similar situation and that’s when I realized that all my symptoms started with the exception of my panic attacks and headaches after I quit using weed. It brought me a lot of reassurance that other people have dealt with withdrawal symptoms contrary to the public’s beliefs that weed does not cause any sort of significant withdrawal symptoms. I am still having muscle twitches, aches, and reduced night sweats since I decided to quit, but know based on other peoples experiences, these symptoms may not subside for quite some time especially for heavy usage for a prolonged period of time and considering I was using during a time in which my brain was still developing makes sense (scary). I have optimism that my symptoms will get better as time goes on and I’m fully committed and prepared for the long haul. I have been so much more productive since I have quit, more social even with my friends who still smoke and it’s been great. The physical symptoms especially my muscle twitches are constant and extremely distracting but its apart of the process and necessary to get to where I want to be.


For all the times I have searched on Reddit without an account or posting, I thought this was something that needed to be said and time was due for a first post. Maybe this will give other people perspective into my experience and even reassure myself that I’m not alone with this process.

Please feel free to share your experience with quitting, similar symptoms, or your story. Hope this is the right place to post and it’s not too long.",2

Tried to quit, went back, and trying to quit again. I would like to hear from people who are at a year or more clean.

The last time I tried to quit I made it about 6 weeks, then convinced myself I could handle moderation on weekends and then ended up daily again. The first 4 weeks I experienced what a lot of people on here have described, a increase in clarity, motivation and energy. But after about 4 weeks I began to feel somewhat depressed. I was in a great healthy routine. Eating right, working out 5 times per week etc. But it began to feel extremely monotonous and I started having creeping existential dread. I know long term withdrawal has something to do with this. But to be honest I remember feeling like this to a lesser extent before I started smoking. My mind started to wonder what the point of all this work etc was. If I was in perfect shape, sober and rich would these feelings really go away? It felt like a rat race with no resolution.

One of the top posts in this sub is about how weed makes you ok with where you are and that achieving greatness and being driven requires stepping out of our comfort zones, weed being one of those comfort zones. But I guess my immediate thought when I read that was ""what is the point of torturing yourself in an effort to achieve some arbitrary level of greatness? Is being a relentless robot the goal here?"" Also isn't meditation literally the practice of being content where you are? I guess I'm just not sure what the point of attempting to ""achieve greatness"" is in the grand scheme of things

My questions for people who have left: was quitting weed or other any other dopamine addiction a massive net positive (not in terms of money, weed is free for me) for you? If so did you experience what I've described? How long did it take to subside? If the answer to the net positive question was yes, was quitting the sole reason for  that net positive or was it combine with dealing with underlying issues via therapy etc?

Thanks,
From someone who feels a little lost.",6

My partner has never really been into weed and has always disliked and resented my use. Initially this caused mild friction in our relationship but I went about using and it wasn’t a huge deal when we were in our 20s. 

Things in our life began to change - got married, had kids, bought a house, etc. I kept on smoking but over time I slowly became more and more secretive about it. I would think “Why should I let her know that I’m gonna go smoke if that will make her be cold and distant to me?” For a long time I felt guilty about the secrecy but my habit also felt somewhat manageable and I could do the mental gymnastics to justify it. 

Then COVID hit and weed became legal where I live around the same time. Now I’m working from home with no accountability and a dispensary literally 10 minutes away from my house. And unlike before when I had to strategically withdraw cash over a few days to buy a bag from a dealer, now I can buy a dispensary preroll for a small amount that will never look suspicious as a cash back withdrawal from the grocery store or pharmacy.

This has been my M.O. for the past few years - being some level of high damn near all the time. Slipping down to the basement to sneak a hit when I’m changing the laundry or in between zoom meetings. Then when I run out, I just tell my wife I’m going to get an energy drink from the grocery store, which just happens to be conveniently across the street from the dispensary. 15 mins later I’m back home with an energy drink in my hand and another pre-roll hiding in my pocket. Rinse. Repeat.

I can’t count how many times I’ve lied to my wife about my weed habit. Lies about going to get it. Lies of denial when she smelled it on me. Even if she doesn’t fully know whats going on, the secrecy has made our relationship more distant and strained. Also, all the lies and deception and keeping track of it all is beyond EXHAUSTING. I feel like it has eroded my inclination for honestly in my day to day life as well.

I’ve read enough about addiction to know how important honesty is in the recovery process. I’m just so terrified of what being honest with my wife will do to our relationship. How much it’s going to hurt her and how much trust I will lose. And beyond the lying, if I’m to be completely honest with her that would also include things I’m ashamed of like the handful of times I’ve driven my kids somewhere high, which I think is egregious enough that she might leave me.

I remember at the beginning of sobriety I couldn’t even maintain a week of being sober. I would sob and cry ever time I reset my sobriety counter cause I could never make it into double digit days. I used to think I was hopelessly addicted and would NEVER be truly sober. 

I smoked when I wanted to eat, I smoked with friends, I smoked in order to watch tv/movies, I smoked at parties, i smoked at college, I smoked for 5-7 years after, I smoked in the morning, I smoked I night & I smoked and smoked smoked alone.

I spent most of my twenties completed baked. I didn’t get a job for 7 years after my college degree cause I was so damn high(f those weed pens/carts for making it so easy). I realized I’m not like my other friends who could balance weed and their careers. It took a lot of soul searching to recognize I needed to quit completely.

   I feel like my life has changed SO much. I have new life goals and I am making strides toward my future career. I don’t think that quitting weed will magically change your life for the better, but rather it will open up space for you to be productive rather than being lazy and couch locked for hours. 

But I made it through withdrawals, and made it through the first few months, I religiously attended the discord leaves meetings,and I’ve completely changed my life around. I made the decision to quit on 4/20 so would never ever make an excuse to smoke again. To use weeds biggest holiday as an annual reminder of why I stopped.

With that said, maybe there’s someone out there in a similar situation who can relate. Feel free to comment or add your own story. I’ll definitely be coming back to this when the going gets tough.


I started smoking weed at the age of 16, over 11 years ago. I immediately fell in love. It made the world less scary, it made it easier to connect with people around me. It gave me the calmness to express myself without the fear of rejection. It made me feel like the version of me that I was supposed to be, not the beaten down by fear and anxiety version I was. It made me feel complete. 

With all that said, it’s not hard to see why I wanted to be high all the time. Which, at first, wasn’t that difficult to do. Just the smallest amount of marijuana would be enough to get me high for 4 to 6 hours. A few smokes a day and I could feel like Superman 24/7. Sure, at times I would be a little lethargic and I definitely wasn’t getting any smarter. But, that was a small price to pay for being the “best” version of myself. 

As the months turned into years the 4-6 hour high quickly dwindled to 2 hours, 1 hour, and eventually got to the point where I’d feel a little high for 20 minutes and then feel tired and depressed. The thing is, and this literally just hit me, growing up I never gave myself credit for anything. I was smart, well-mannered, decent at sports, loved video games and movies, passionate about music, and had many things going for me that I just took for granted. All I saw was the negative. 

The saddest part of this story is that my addiction to marijuana took all the stuff that made me who I was and burned it to the ground. I stopped caring about friends, family, hobbies, passions… literally everything I was interested in was replaced by marijuana. So, in essence, I replaced all of my real skills/interests with something that generated a false confidence. On top of that, marijuana made me so much more anxious over the years that now I have to fight dissociation/depersonalization which is a mindfuck in itself.

So here I am, almost 12 years after “fixing”my problems with my first joint, back at square one. Facing the same problems I had when I was 16, except my brain’s barely able to snap out of the dissociation to focus, my memories are pretty much all faded, my musical and intellectual skills are pretty much gone, and my social skills are even worse than they were before I started smoking.

Then I moved to a state where it was legal and just kept finding reasons to use it more and more. 

But then my friends from college stopped smoking a moved on and I couldn’t live without it. They were getting better jobs and I couldn’t hold one down. I was smoking just to smoke. It was there so why not?

I have been on a personal healing journey and it led to me asking myself why do I always turn to weed to comfort me? Why isn’t it comforting me anymore? 

I read the book Healing the Shame that Binds You and the author correlates addiction with internalized toxic shame. 

I started working on my shame and have been able to shed some of it and my urge to numb and cope with weed has subsided. I am working on goals to feel good about myself rather than covering up with weed. I stopped buying it and having it around the house. I’m working on replacing that habit with better habits.

I’ve quit alcohol and nicotine, but nothing compares to this.  I have a general sense of unease, anxiety and a feeling I’ve never had before: depression/sadness.  But despite the depression/sadness, I also feel numb.

This either was the best time or the worst time to end this shit.  My father is dying.  My business is overwhelming me.  I feel guilty for smoking the last two years.

I never smoked until I was 23.  And that was one night.   I smoked again about a year later and then nothing for more than 2 decades.  Two years ago I thought that smoking would help me with my worries and also help me in my spiritual pursuits.  

While it helped to open my mind, it also created a fearful person that I simply don’t know.  I feel that my anxiety actually got worse.  It screwed up my eating habits.  I preferred staying home to enjoying the world.  While there were positives and it was good to get it out of my system, I hate myself for the two years wasted on this lie.   The pain is pretty significant now.

I’m pushing through.  I’m a firm believer that the body needs to be at homeostasis.  We shouldn’t be too “high” or too “low”, but rather somewhere in the middle.   I guess the pain I’m feeling now is my body balancing itself out.   I wanted all the yang and none of the yin...I got it then...now I’m experiencing the yin I buried for 2 years.   What goes up must come down.

I need a perspective.

We all know that phase when, being a stoner who realized the destructive patterns of binge-smoking, could not decide to stop smoking once and for all, so he convinced himself to ""take a break"" and ""control his smoking habits""

I am at that stage, again.

I have been a stoner for four years now. I love it so much. Yet, I cannot control it. It always goes beyond control. And I find myself binge-smoking throughout the day. My mind happens to convince me every time and one day after deciding to take a break from smoking, I find myself in the same spot, binge-smoking. I have been able to take some short breaks (3-8 days) but very rarely. I am 28 years old. To be honest, last night I was thinking and I realized that I did not significantly improve from who I was a few years ago. In fact, I got worse. And that, I believe, is because of my relationship with cannabis throughout the past four years. I have an addictive personality, and I tend to obsess over what I love. I can notice this destructive pattern in myself in different contexts. No matter how much I try to regulate my smoking behavior, I find myself binge-smoking, every time. Yet, I always find myself in debate with my mind: should I quit cannabis once and for all? or should I ""fix"" my relationship with it? I tend to choose the second option every time. Because thinking about quitting cannabis for good scares me.

I am afraid of quitting once and for all for multiple reasons. The first one (which stays to be true, at least partly) is the 'constructive' part of cannabis. It smoothes a lot of things up. For me personally, I was able to explore a whole another side of me, a whole another dimension through cannabis. I became more philosophical, very abstract, and able to see ""a bigger picture"". And that contributed to my intelligence and perspective towards life. So I am afraid I would lose that capacity or compromise it if I quit. 

The second reason is that cannabis has been so attached to my identity. Cannabis played a huge role in the last four years. It had such an important role that I ""cannot"" imagine my life without cannabis, completely. 

The third one is that I am afraid I would miss some great moments if I quit. You know, the casual evenings with friends or the stoners gaming nights. If I quit, I would need to learn how to enjoy life sober. That seems like a huge mountain that scares me.

So like that, I have been choosing to ""take a break"" and ""regulate"" my smoking pattern so I could enjoy both worlds, sober one and stoned one. 

Could that really exist? or am I just fooling myself? 

I have been checking different stories here and they are heart-warming to read. I figured I would share with you where I am at, so you might help me overcome this.

Thank you for reading",1

2022-02-14 07:10:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ss96fa/i_remember_when_i_used_to_work_opening_shifts_at/,I remember when I used to work opening shifts at Taco Bell.,"When I opened, I ended up waking up at 4am. I’d go through the usual morning routine of stretching, showering, eating breakfast, and brushing my teeth, or I wouldn’t. My morning would be great, but every morning I always had an urge to smoke weed. And so I’d arrive 45 minutes before the manager did and I would end up smoking a joint or two in my car, or just take dabs while listening to music. My life became “bearable” as the world around me changed. My mind went into slow-mo mode as I kept getting more and more faded, and usually almost before every shift I’d always regret smoking so much because I was pretty zooted off my ass. But it ceased to amaze me that as a 17 year old at the time, I never got caught, or nobody gave a fuck to notice. I ended up making mistakes throughout the day, every day even though I’ve memorized my opening schedule, and I got pissed at my coworkers or manager because they were only doing their jobs and telling me what to do. It was only when I came in sober that I was actually organized, but without weed, it made me pretty pissed off. Weed was my autopilot, and it’s never made me more stuck in life. I’m not reflecting on myself, not learning anything from my mistakes. Everything just felt like a dream. My thought process was “okay well I’m done with my beans and rice so it’s time for….. uhm… do I have everything down in my therm? The floors are dirty, and shit someone on line needs me to drop egg. I can’t do that, I have to prepare for my 11am!” I was very disorganized. But when my break came around, all of it was a blur. I ended up going home for my break and then smoke more dabs with my other coworkers. “It really makes it feel like a fresh new day” she told me as she took a dab through her $60 bong. 

Moral of the story, if you feel like you can’t make a day without smoking weed, think about how it controls you. Think about how much clearer your thought process is without it. You are the master of your own destiny, and if you believe you can, then you CAN do anything you put your mind to. Don’t be stuck in life wondering where it all went wrong. Only you have the power to stop looking back and embrace your future.",27
2022-02-14 05:17:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ss7db3/im_emotionally_relapsing_hard_and_im_struggling/,I'm emotionally relapsing hard and I'm struggling.,"Hi everyone. I'm 5 months sober after being a stoner for 11 years. Usually I come here just to post milestones but I'm feeling down on myself. I think I know what to do but I'm still struggling. I'll try my best to be concise because a lot is going on in my head.

This is a list of variables I'm working with:
1. **I'm an addict through and through.** Even though I've quit weed, I'm still looking for highs. I have to be careful of emotional eating, masturbating, playing too many videogames, watching too much YouTube. I've been doing all of these behaviors a lot. I've been eating junk food when I'm full and I've been using the same reasoning that I used when I'd justify smoking copious amounts of weed. It leaves my body feeling like shit and I'm very tired of the pattern of insanity. 
2. **I haven't been taking care of my mental health hygiene lately.** I've been feeling overwhelmed so I've been managing my time poorly. Usually I meditate in the morning, write a list of 10 positive affirmations, do yoga. In the afternoon I do yoga to stretch. My partner and I go to the gym together maybe 2-3 times a week. Every night I should be doing yoga, writing down what I'm grateful for, and writing down my accomplishments. It sounds like a lot but it keeps me on track. It keeps my mental health good.
3. **I am PMSing.** I get my period either today or tomorrow or something and I always get anxiety before my period because of the unlikely chance that I could be pregnant, which I do not want. 
4. **I missed 2 group therapy sessions and one 1on1 therapy session.** I'm in an IOP (Intensive Outpatient) program and I didn't make the last few sessions I should have made. Usually I'm going to 3 group therapy sessions a week and one 1on1 session a week. It sounds like a lot but it has been the best damage control for what my addictive nature has done to me. I was visiting family that I never see so I wanted to give them all the attention I could. 
5. **I was supposed to chair an MA meeting but I got the time wrong and was unable to chair this week.** Everyone at this MA meeting is totally understanding and I need to extend this to myself. This event set me off. I was 15 minutes late so I couldn't do it. I was really looking forward to chairing my first MA meeting and I fucked it up. I think my addict mind made it easier to not be careful of the time because I was so obsessed with being in my own world doing my own thing.
6. **I am emotionally relapsing.** I am hard on myself when I make mistakes, as many addicts are. I'm frustrated that I keep repeating these self destructive patterns. I feel bad because I keep shaming myself. This type of attitude will enable me to crave and reach for weed and other drugs if I don't get it under control. 
7. **I am upset that I was unable to plan a special Valentine's day for my partner and I.** It fell through the cracks. I care so much about my relationship and I want to celebrate it on a day like today but I am so busy with recovery stuff that it's literally impossible to do anything today.
8. **I am frustrated that true recovery is long-term.** Problems don't just go away for me when I've put down weed. Weed is not inherently the problem. The fact that I'm an addict is. To me, being an addict manifests in many ways and makes everything worse, from my ADHD to my physical health. I have an addictive personality and this doesn't go away after I ""get over"" my weed addiction. I smoked weed to mask all these lifelong, deep rooted problems that I will probably have to deal with for years. Addicts are generally impatient and I am no exception. 

My recovery plan:
1. **Prioritize my mental health hygiene.** I have been neglecting that as pointed out earlier, so I will be doing a meditation, yoga, and writing down positive affirmations after I post this. I need to focus on prioritizing the care of my mind. 
2. **I will call and talk to my sponsor later today.** I have a sponsor through MA. I have been texting and occasionally calling her a few times a week to maintain and grow a relationship where I feel comfortable reaching out in times like this.
3. **I am going to group therapy tonight.** I will be sharing what I typed here with the group therapist as well as all the participants. It helps to share this with other people who are actively in recovery for addiction.
4. **I am avoiding interacting with my family.** I love them and care for them, but they are all addicts with their own vices and not in recovery. While they are supportive of my recovery, they are the opposite of helpful. I have been aggressive with them instead of assertive in my early recovery. I should not be talking to them until I rebound from this emotional relapse. 
5. **One thing at a time.** I have ADHD so my head is in 20 places at once on a bad day. It enables me to shut down and let my addictive nature take over. I have to focus on the 4 things on this recovery plan and not bother with the rest.

I felt super sad the last days and some people here said that indeed ""PMS + withdrawal is no joke"". And let me tell you, they were right. This period took a toll on me like few others before - not so much in the pain-factor (barely any?!) but physically: I bled a lot. And I mean A LOT more than usual. It was physically debilitating where I would feel lightheaded and constantly tired. Just all of my energy went into my uterus it seems.

Now it's dying down and I feel like my uterus cleaned itself out. I know it's absurd and not scientifically accurate but it felt like a cleanse. A bloody ritualistic cleanse hahaha. No, I'm not ""witchy"" or esoteric or anything. There was just so much blood that it seems that all of the blood inside me now must fresh and new.

So basically that's what I did the last couple of days: go to the beach (lovely!) and paint some old furniture while trying not to faint.

Trying to come to terms with the thought that ""I'm not a smoker"", although I'm also trying not to pressure myself too much and just not think about it. (""It"" being the future of smoking/not-smoking weed, not the weed itself)

As always thank you for listening and for the awesome people on here who always have something nice and helpful to say! Love you!",17

On top of that, I recently had to end things with a girl I was enamored with because emotionally the feelings weren't neutral and she didn't want attachment.

Essentially, I've been making right decisions for my life's future, but I'm still unhappy. I really want to just smoke up and separate from the pain for an evening.

I smoked during school because I could cruise get decent grades and not worry because I was passing school that was a win. Now I just don't have anything to care about to drive that passion. I feel void. Like there's things I can work on, but what's the point? Nothing matters. I'm stuck in a cycle of my own existential futility, so why not get high? 

Not giving a fuck would feel so much better than being depressed right? Or would I just be being a bitch and not investing my time in creating a better foundation.

I started smoking regularly in my junior year of college and have smoked almost daily for ~7 years since, with occasional breaks. It started as a way to manage depression/anxiety and get out of a heavy alcohol party scene, which was initially a huge relief, but over the years, it’s become less and less adaptive.

Today is the day that I decided I had finally had enough of my own BS. I am so sick of feeling down about my weight (nightly munchies!), hiding the extent of my usage from family and friends, having whole chunks of the day in which I’m too stoned to participate in life, and the feeling that I’m working against my long-term goals (finishing my master’s this spring and getting a good job, seeing what my body and mind feel/look like when I don’t smoke every day). 

Tonight is the first night going to sleep sober and I’m excited to have made it through the day, but having trouble sleeping and nervous about the likely nightmares!

When I was 25, my Dad was visiting to help me with some things. All of a sudden he just started feeling pain in his chest, fell to the ground, and stopped breathing. I called 911, tried to give him CPR but he was gone. His heart just stopped from a massive heart attack. He was gone in seconds. My dad was my best friend, and I honestly felt like almost every last piece of me died with him.

A couple months later, after fighting with my mother over every little thing, I felt completely alone. I went out with a couple people one night and I met this guy. It wasn't long before his friend offered me weed, and I was quickly addicted.

Well, the guy I met turned out to be verbally abusive, manipulative and controlling, but I was alone and felt like he was the only person I had. Then one night I got really stoned, and drunk, and he raped me. He was sober, and he didn't ever smoke weed. I didn't even understand what happened the first time. In fact I don't know how many times it happened because after a while I just stopped trying to say no and just let it happen. I eventually got up the courage to leave him, but spent the next 4 years stoned almost every day trying to not think about it. Skipped bills, power cut off multiple times, almost got evicted, cause all my money was spent on pot. I tried quitting twice, but here I am again trying to quit for the 3rd time after finally processing everything that happened to me.

For the longest time I blamed myself for losing my father. I thought I didn't do CPR right or not quick enough but the doctor told me there was nothing I could have done. I still get flashbacks and nightmares of this sometimes but less and less. My mom and I are still working on our relationship but we've both been doing much better.

For the longest time I blamed myself and the weed I smoked for being raped. But he knew I was vulnerable, and he took advantage of me. That's on him. He knew what he was doing. But I still feel guilty sometimes... I have no evidence he did anything, I didn't even know what he was doing in the moment, sometimes I was half asleep, but I still feel guilty sometimes.

Whenever I think about either of those things, I reach for a smoke. But this time, because I'm actually trying to heal from the trauma, I don't want to smoke anymore. But I'm only 2 days sober. Have any of you become addicted for similar reasons? Do you have any advice on how to resist relapsing again? I don't like ""Addictions anonymous"" cause I'm not religious and I know I don't have to be but it just makes me uncomfortable when people talk about God or higher power. I'll take almost any advice, anything you think might be helpful. As long as it doesn't involve religion. Or maybe what helped/is helping you stay sober? I used to see a therapist and he really helped me process my trauma, but I just feel like right now I need to use what he gave me and move forward.

I hope that we can all help each other through this difficult time <3 Stay strong and don't give up. We can get through this!! This time I believe I can do this and so can you!",7

My symptoms now are much much much worse compared to the symptoms i had the first couple times i tried, which was very bearable. 
Ive smoked less actually after the first couple times i quit, although its still everyday. Im not sure why its much mire unbearable now.

Its a weird feeling, i feel like im going mad.
So please if there are any medications or things that helped you guys through. Please respond.

My symptoms are pretty much the same as everybody elses but this time its much worse.

I work remote, so the freedom makes avoiding relapsing harder than ever. I work as a software dev and constantly find myself going “fuck this, I just want to get high”. But the routine of this job is a bit like an airplane dashboard. In my three years in the workforce, I’ve quickly found out how easily the cracks can show. Being forgetful, sounding intoxicated, I simply can’t be high in the job. And unfortunately since I have it as bad as you guys, I can’t be high at all.

I’m exercising everyday, eating well, doing chores to distract myself, but I’m so fucking tired, bored, and ultimately depressed. It goes without saying, this was so much easier unemployed. I don’t get cold sweats, lack of sleep or any of that. I think that all ended because I tried quitting a week prior and faced all that.

I only have two friends really, one of which smokes weed, the other is more of an old friend. I don’t really share much in common with either except weed with the former.

Do I need to tell the stoner friend we can’t be friends, or just let it taper off over time. He always ends up calling me, complaining I’m playing hide n seek. I feel bad avoiding him, but he’s not good for me.

But that OP was deleted, im leaving it here in hopes more people can find it if they are looking to find someone with a similar story.  Also sorry its so long, but I literally just made my reddit account today just to share this here.

Okay here we go, I started smoking at 18, I was able to keep it to a few times a week until I was 25 or so, Ive been smoking everyday since then for 11 years and am now 36. I smoked a toke 1to3 times a day which equaled out to slightly over an 1/8th every 3 weeks. That seemed like kind of a lot to me, but most of the potheads i know smoke like triple that and then some.

I quit 15days ago now and so far its been mostly smooth sailing. I was having slight trouble sleeping the first week but that was nothing because I was 100% expecting it, and my sleep patterns were already back to where i'd like them after like day 6. I also was sweating a little ((just clammy hands and light night sweats)) but thats no big deal, and again I was 100% expecting that as my hands would always get clammy if i had to go 1 day without smoking. Thats it, those are the only withdrawl symptoms that were immediately apparent to me in this 15 days.

I also have had mild anxiety, but im trying to get a new job, my car went kaput during the 15 days im quitting, and i need dental work done but have no insurance ((this is not new ive been putting this off for very long but contacted an oral surgeon about it when i was in beteween jobs, but i told them i didnt have insurance and they fucking ghosted me so Im just trying to get a job with insurance first right now)), so I feel like mild anxiety from all of this is normal, and if anything most people would be freaking out way more. Thats just the person I am though, I know how good Ive had it, when my time comes i will have no complaints. And i dont have a family to take care of so its only me that will suffer.

So completely understandable anxiety, light sweats, and a few days missing 3/4 hours of sleep were the only symptoms I noticed. ..... Until I stepped on a scale.

I dropped 9 lbs in the first week quitting, down from 170 to 161lbs. I thought maybe it was from not fully recovering from covid i had 2 months ago or something, or maybe it was somehow tied to withdrawl, or mild stress(((((I weighed myself right before i quit weed, which was a month removed from my sickness, and was down to 168, assumed this 2 lbs was from being sick and not eating during the sickness and just yet to regain)))),. I hoped since my sleep returned to normal and all that, that today my weight wouldve gone up atleast an Lb or 2. It did not. Today at the 15 day mark I dropped 5 more lbs since last week, Making it 14lbs in 15 days. I am now at the weight I was the day I graduated high school, 156 lbs, down from 170.

About my body comp. Im 6'1, skinny, very athletic. Very very athletic for a 36 year old. I have never not been able to see my abs for a single day in my whole life, even if i didnt work out for 6 months, even when i was 170. NOW I CANNOT STRESS THIS POINT ENOUGH, I DID NOT LOSE APPETITE PERIOD!!!!!! MY DIET DID NOT CHANGE PERIOD!!!! I HAVE HAD NO STOMACH PROBLEMS PERIOD!!!! I EAT THE SAME THINGS EVERY DAMN DAY TO WARD OFF ANY MORE DENTAL PROBLEMS BEFORE I CAN RECTIFY THEM. Im basically counting calories every day and they are the same. STILL DOWN 14 lbs in 15 days. I dont feel weird, when i lift weights i have not gotten any weaker, but this whole 14 lbs in 15 days is just freaking bizarre. I want to know what is happening. Being my high school weight is my limit, cuz im foolishly holding out hope my body is trying to revert back to my pre weed state or something. If I drop one more lb thats the breaking point, Im gonna have to see a doctor with no insurance or make peace with my death once again.

Currently just sharing this so if anyone else has this experience they will have someone to relate to, and I will be back in a month or two to provide those people peace of mind to know they are not dying, that is if I'm not dead. If you dont hear from me by 4/20/22 Im a goner. Thats a promise. I cant stand all these people on forums that are ""help me help me"" and then they dont follow up to provide answers that will help others.

TLDR/ down 14 lbs in 15 days of quitting weed after 18 years of use. DID NOT CHANGE DIET OR LOSE APPETITE, no other notable symptoms from quitting the HERB. 6'1 went from 170>156, and didnt have much fat to lose.",9

(No visuals yet)

Fast forward to June I begged my mother to let me smoke it took a long time but she gave in I became a full blow stoner for about 5 months. (No visuals yet)

Around November I noticed when I didn’t have weed for a while I’d still feel high plus derealization and the world just looked off, I figured I needed a tolerance break but then after some time of not smoking it only got worse easily the worse I’ve ever felt, this caused me to dive into weed withdrawal symptoms online. 

I don’t remember exactly when I noticed the snow but I think it was about 2 weeks in it drove me crazy i thought of every reason I was even convinced I had diabetes got checked out and they said I was severely dehydrated and had signs malnutrition basically told me to just drink water at this point I had lost over 50 pounds

I was going crazy starving myself became a shell of my former self.

Fast forward to now I was kinda just floating felt lost and empty and the rest I told you right?  I gave in and smoked after 76 days now as I looked back it was a stupid reasoning and the high was so scary 

Now I’m just worried I’ve caused further damage+made the snow worse. And that I’ll never go away or start to fade again, I feel really remorseful and I regret ever smoking it feels like I’m at the brink of an anxiety attack it feels like a lot to process and

I’m not sure if this is hppd or anxiety but I’m going crazy and it feels like I’m gonna explode",2

For the last several weeks I have had bouts of early morning anxiety, gastrointestinal issues and have been generally irritable. 

Initially, I figured I had some kind of GI issue and worrying about it triggered anxiety in me. While this still may be the root cause of the initial anxiety, I have come to accept that the weed is not helping me and only worsening the situation. 

This sucks. I love weed. I never thought I’d want to quit. I don’t really want to quit. But I need to. I haven’t smoked any flower in two
weeks thinking small puffs from my pen will ween me off but it’s not lessening my anxiety. I haven’t even made it a full day yet.

take your time and learn about quitting and try try and try. i can say to try in small parts of time. one hour, two hour.

and clean your home, smoke only in one place and only one place.

It's my third or fourth time doing this. Went mad on the edibles this time, fucking myself up every night, to the point where I'd play games until I passed out, five months of this... Christ, I felt grim in the mornings. 

Weed has been my best friend for the last 4 years. My beautiful escapism where I felt infinite false contentment. Throwing a rug over my spiralling mental health and total lack of fulfilment with life, work, non-existent relationships... it was everything. 

How silly all that seems now. And yet, in three weeks, a month, those little thoughts of *'I'll be able to control it this time, only on the weekends,'* will be back to haunt me, as they always do. But it won't work, it won't get to me, and I won't go back. 

I can't postpone my existence with weed anymore. I won't give in this time. I'll exercise, eat correctly, meditate, grow my veggies in the garden and relish in nature. I'll do all of it.

Sorry if this is rambly. 

I’m on day 10 no weed and the anxiety in the morning is reaally rough, almost paralyzing, then it subsides a bit as I shower and get ready etc, tends to get worse as the day goes on and then by the night time I feel like I kind of exhaust myself from worrying and I chill out a bit. 

I have really obsessive thoughts, nonstop, but unfortunately they are (in my mind) not exactly irrational thoughts- people I’ve hurt, mistakes I’ve made, bad reputation I’ve made for myself in some instances and worried what people are saying about me… I guess what I’m trying to focus on is giving myself grace and looking forward to doing better in the future but why in my worst moments is it impossible to rationalize and just accept the consequences of my actions? My mind just goes and goes and goes it makes me sick and I feel there’s no escape. Then, the same night when I’m in a better state I can have the same exact thoughts and deal with them much better- what will be will be, some people will always love you, you can’t control what people say/think, you aren’t a monster just have made mistakes, etc. How is it that my brain chemistry of the moment can determine logic, rationalization, and outlook SO MUCH. I guess I never realized just how much until this withdrawal, makes me feel insane that I can’t control my thoughts, that my emotional intelligence isn’t really emotional intelligence and in fact I’m just a slave to my hormones, it’s really unsettling. 

Another thing I noticed is that caffeine absolutely destroys me right now, I had one coffee today and I was so panicked I wanted to throw up… usually I can have several and feel nothing, just more alert.

Lastly I find that the only thing that helps momentarily is cardio but it’s so hard to even get out of bed honestly but when I manage it my outlook improves at least for an hour or so.

Weed affects brain structures like the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in ways that make it easy to forget about emotions while high, and then actually make it harder to cope with those emotions once sober, creating a downward spiral of always needing to numb the emotions with more dope. 

In my own experience of smoking for 10 years, and now being sober for 7+ weeks, I feel like I am peeling back layers of old emotion. I feel old, unprocessed anger at roommates I haven't seen in years, I feel sadness about relationships that ended long ago. 

I sometimes feel like the exact same confused, lonely, anxious teenager that I was when I first started smoking weed, just now with more adult responsibilities and more knowledge. 

Emotionally, my growth has been stunted, and the emotional maturation I have experienced was through very unfortunate experiences of my own making, due to being an emotional idiot.

Been struggling with depression and hopelessness regarding my future prospects, the state of the world, money etc. It was bordering on suicidal to be honest and I felt like well I rather be high than suicidal yknow. Not that getting high solves my problems but I guess I was starting to think maybe being in a different mind space like being high would give me a bit more perspective or whatever. I guess my reasoning is weed puts me at this constant baseline of feeling “meh. Contentish” constantly while sobriety is a roller coaster. I have moments where I’m definitely a lot happier than I was when I was smoking, but my lows are a lot lower than when I smoked, last night and the past couple night being those moments. I have a lot of trauma and I’m broke, I can’t help but feel like people get to smoke for lesser reasons and here I am struggling. Starting to feel like maybe I should use smoking as a reward or motivation to do certain things because my life is getting rough. But i guess I know I should stick to sobriety, I at least gotta shoot for 100 days. Don’t really know what I want out of posting this other than to get my thoughts out there.

I'm on Day 4 of kicking the carts. The stuff I'm going through isn't too bad I suppose. I've been sweating a lot lately, but I know that helps. I'm able to eat, and I get hungry. I don't sleep through the night completely but I am able to fall asleep. Morning are the hardest for me, it might've started from when I had COVID two weeks ago which fucked me up big time. Its like a light anxiety at this point. I wake up and think, ""well shit, what am I going to do all day"" and I'm basically just looking for stuff to take my mind off of things until it's night time where I'm more relaxed. Mostly because my 5 month old is in bed. It helps that I go to work during the week, I leave the house by 7:15 and don't get back till 5. I'm sure the feeling comes from me getting high with literally everything I did. Especially on the weekends.

I know everyone is different but I see some posts on this subreddit where people have withdrawal symptoms that go on for months and they don't regain clarity or stuff like that after 3 months. But they also talk about being a daily user for like 25 years or like a decade.

I have only started being a daily smoker about 5 years ago, and then switched to carts daily 3 years ago. During the week I would only smoke at nights but the weekends I would smoke early if I felt like it,  sometimes I would hold out until after noon but I didn't really have a schedule. 

Is it fair to assume that the longer you would be smoking for the longer you would go through withdrawals? I'm just trying to get more experience or advice from other people. Thanks!",6

If there is weed in the house I’m smoking it every chance I get. But if it’s not here my cravings are weak and fleeting. 

I’ve been off it for 2 months. Love it. Dreams. Clarity. Self esteem. Better sleep.  Yes I’ve had thoughts of weed (small quick cravings) most evenings, or general down time. 

But overall I’d call this time easy and successful. However………

I got my dad a little gift for super bowl today. He mentioned he had some friends coming over. 

He used to smoke as a youth but quit long ago when I was a baby. As adults we have smoked together a handful of times and a few times I’ve bought them edibles. 

So I took a little puff of a pre roll and put it back. It’s a nice feeling and yes tbh there is some guilt. But not much. I take full responsibility. 

And I know that after this I’m gonna take another long cruise of sobriety. longer than this stretch I had been on (personal best). In life when I practice I get better and this is no different. 

And I also know that this situation or a similar one will happen again in the future. But I’m not worried about it because I will never again own/hold product in the house. That’s what enables the daily habit. Out of sight out of mind. This was fun. On to another long run!",14

I didn’t do much anyways at home. I was hangover from the party (because of the booze, not the weed), so I layed in bed and watched Netflix for a little. 

But I have answered every single message and call I have received (I never do that when high). And now I’m getting up and getting some study (which I wouldn’t have done either if I was high)

for backstory, i’m a 29 year old man that works full-time, plays in a couple semi successful bands, works out+plays soccer, and has a great network of supportive friends and family. 

i know i’m extremely hard on myself in a lot of ways. when it comes to weed as of recently, i would smoke after my work day was over, and often would smoke the weekends away. but every bag was my last bag, or i’ll buy a preroll tonight and stop after that. 

it doesn’t feel good to wake up angry at yourself for smoking and by the end of the day itching for another hit. this was EVERYDAY for me. but recently, i auditioned for a band that would allow me to tour internationally and thankfully i made the cut. i told myself with this big change, it’s finally time to cut weed out. 

first three days were mentally brutal (per usual based on any other break i’ve taken). constantly alternating between the dispensary menu and this group. very little sleep, insane dreams while asleep. but i’m incredibly proud to have made it this far and i hope to continue the streak. 

i felt extremely isolated with my addiction to weed, as friends saw no issue with my nightly smoking. but finding this group has been so calming for me and helped me to recognize that my addiction is very much legitimate.",17

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit and pretty proud this of this post. This community has been really inspiring me to quit and I finally did it.   
I have been smoking since I was 16 everyday and I'm 23 this year. The only time I ever quit was when I got a job for an airline company which I really wanted therefore I stopped but when COVID hit and I lost that job, I went back to work for my old job and because I knew that job so well, it was very easy to go back to my old ways.   
I decided to quit because my thoughts were getting really dark and I was somewhat suicidal which I've never been before. I just thought maybe being sober would kind of clear these thoughts of mine. It sort of did as I'm actually getting out and doing things with friends and family but it's so so different when I'm alone. I panic, I sweat and pace around my house with the worst thoughts. I don't really know if I should seek help or are these just withdrawals from it? The lost of appetite is completely gone and I feel I'm not as irritated as I was before but when do these dark thoughts go away?   


Thank you to anyone who replies or even gave their time to read this.   
To everyone who is on the same journey, I am so so happy for us.",7

Good. Good first start.

BUT, now I am realizing that weed was not destroying my life - I WAS destroying my life. 

After all, weed is not ambulant. It cannot just get up and jump into my body. I have to ingest it. 

Blaming weed for my problems shifts the responsibility from where it should be squarely blamed: ME

This perspective is both liberating and scary, because I realize I have so much more to work on than just quitting weed. I need to really drill down into the reasons I was using weed (and nicotine) and start peeling back that onion.

It's going to be a lot of work, and I need to remind myself that it will take a while and not to rush (I have a bad habit of crossing the street and then looking both ways, metaphorically).

Hope everyone is doing good today.",317

Hi, just found out about this sub and wanted to share my horrible experience with paws which i think im still struggling with even after 2 years( because of my own negligence). So i was smoking weed and hash regularly everyday with no trouble, living my best life until one night( after 1.5 years of smoking) i got too conscious about smoking up everyday, thinking that i’m wasting my life and wouldn’t be successful in the future and shit like that and got in a panicky state after smoking 2 joints ( was trying to shake off the feeling but it got worst). I decided to quit cold turkey after that night, biggest mistake of my fuckin life. The anxiety and depression hit me baddddd after a week, i just thought that these were normal withdrawal symptoms and would go after a month or so ( didn’t know alot about paws back then). 

So after a month of quitting , the anxiety went from 3/10 to 7/10, the quality of life was bad and the only thing that gave me joy was alocohol, which i abused one night and had the worst ever anxiety and depression the next day and guess what, i decided to smoke up that night ( i just couldn’t take it anymore). That was the time when i really messed it up, i smoked up with my buddies and got a very very very bad anxiety attack, i was convinced that everyone in the room were talking about me and looking at me for no reason(they weren’t), i went to the other room, looked myself in the mirror trying to calm myself that no ones talking about you and stop before your brain explodes and you die (literally felt like it). That night completely changed me, i was not me anymore, it was like something switched in my brain. I starting smoking again thinking that it would somehow fix me but it would just give me extreme paranoia, but i still smoked up for days not caring that i had quit (my brain was totally fucked). To keep it short, one day i did edibles which gave me dp/dr, I didn’t know what i was doing at this point. After 6-7 months I totally recovered from dp/dr and anxiety, it was a long bad journey. The only thing i am going through now (since a year prior to dp/dr) is anhedonia and total emotional blunting which is persistent and i dont know if i could ever go normal again, i think i have permanently fried my receptors or something. Should i still consider it as weed paws because it has been 2 years since it all happend or should i look into things to fix the anhedonia? I just wanted to let it out as i found this sub which might have similar experiences. Any tips about what to do now would be appreciated. I have completely stopped smoking up, its still not fun because of anhedonia but i dont want it anymore.",4

Weed helped me not see it but now it’s crystal clear. And I don’t even care about smoking anymore. I just hate this fucking world. Friends, family, nobody appreciates anything. Nobody appreciates love so I’ll hate instead. Until my doom✌🏽",2

I have tried to quit for a while but I always had access where I mostly reside. End of January i was going on a trip abroad, at my parents home. So no access and the fresh air of the countryside was a strong motivator.

I wont lie, the first week it was hard to eat, I had cravings for 10 days. Now I am close to 3 weeks and I feel so much better. Like mind is clearer, mood is stable. I feel emotions but its nice and I get to work through deep issues I would have not been able to if I was still smoking and numb due to continuous use. It's worth it! I hope this encourage anyone who still struggle with cravings.

I will add that checking any deficiency on my end, help to solve deeper issue and why i was trying to regulate or deal with my emotions through weed. Not encouraging any specific magic trick but adressing those deficiency helped with stabilizing my mood and made quitting easier. I barely had withdrawal symptoms beside a little bit of irritability, lack of appetite and falling asleep at first.",6

Went to a party.. other stuff was involved (don’t think this subreddit allows details on that to divulged) and it eventually lead to me smoking weed… 

I did so with a few others, ended up having some deep conversations. Someone else didn’t like the content of said conversations and got shitty. Then I had a wave of paranoia and felt completely out of myself.. looking at everyone and feeling like what the hell am I doing here. 

I truly feel like it was a sign..I caved and smoked weed and it let to drama and me feeling yuck. 

So glad to be back on track with one day sober again.",2

I'm a few weeks into quitting and I feel my brain healing. It's fucking rad.,"I'm self employed. I'm a full time photographer and ex web developer who still writes code and designs for my own projects. I've never been much of a ""social"" smoker but I used to think it really helped me ""get in the zone"" when working, so I'd be taking little pipe hits throughout the day. Even when I was full time employed as a web developer, I'd sneak off and take a hit and I got some truly awesome work done while stoned.

But over the last few years (I'm 40 btw) I've noticed my short term memory really starting to take some hits (no pun lol), and despite being relatively healthy in most other ways, I'm way too blasted at the end of each day when I'm smoking. I recently went on vacation and didn't smoke the whole time, and contrary to prior experiences I wasn't grumpy or moody from being off the weed, I felt great.

So I decided, fuck it, it's time to quit for good.  I'm now a few weeks deep and I just feel fan-fucking-tastic. Like I've instantly reverse-aged by a decade. And I know that whatever benefits of focus and ""getting in the zone"" I got from weed, I'm getting more benefits from the clarity and I literally feel like my brain is healing. My short term memory is already improving, all those little ""fuck why'd I walk into this room?"" moments are happening much less frequently if at all.

I mean... duh.  But it's awesome. And so far hasn't been hard (being on vacation the first week helped big time).

One last quick comment, the DREAMS are fucking wild and sometimes terrifying, so vivid, every single night.  But I've found I have some control over how ""good"" or ""bad"" they are. I've been telling myself when I go to bed, ""let them come, but let's make them interesting and not horrible"" and it seems to be working for the most part the last few days. Mr Toad's Wild Ride though fo sho, I know you can all relate.

Cheers leaves crew. I don't hate the weed or regret my years using, but it feels awesome to make this switcheroo and has given me a new lease on life.",112

2022-02-12 15:03:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sqzx4m/i_finally_outgrew_weed/,I finally outgrew weed,"I tried to quit so many times before but the cravings always brought me back to it. This last time I got super stoned in public and became aware of how different I behaved when I'm high. I had an emotional moment in a parking lot where I recorded my thoughts on the topic and started crying when I thought about how my kid self was so free and expressive and I didn't remember how to be that kid anymore.

I realized that weed was only masking my intuition and preventing me from getting to know myself and connecting with others. It was preventing me from feeling my emotions and exacerbated my depression and apathy. I wasted so much time in this suppressive state trying to avoid being myself at all costs.

I threw my vape pen away and lost all desire to smoke. Two weeks later it still hasn't come back and I'm kind of shocked at how averse I feel to smoking again. I never thought I would be able to outgrow weed but it seems to have happened and I'm really happy that I don't have cravings. It used to be the first thing I thought about when I woke up and now the craving is completely gone. I thought I was addicted and the problem was my body needed it to function but it turned out to be mostly psychological.

So to anyone struggling with cravings, I'd recommend turning a camera on yourself or using text to speech software to discuss why you feel compelled to smoke and run away from yourself and how effective weed is at masking your emotions. Contemplate on trusting your intuition when it comes to yourself and knowing what's best for you. Ask yourself about what really motivates you and what your gut is telling you to do. Try to remember the freedom you felt as a kid and ask yourself what is preventing you from feeling that freedom of self again. Think about what you really want for yourself and if weed is serving you in pursuing those goals. Watch or listen or read it back to yourself and see if you can connect with yourself to overcome this. Give yourself the catharsis your greater self is so desperate for.

2022-02-12 15:00:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sqzuzw/2_years_sober_2_whole_frigging_years_sober/,2 years sober! 2 whole frigging years sober!!! 🥳🥳,"*Apologies, this is super long but once I started I didn't seem to want to stop. There are actual tips at the bottom but most is just one woman's super boring story of sobriety* 🙃

Where do I start? The beginning, right? Nah. I'll start with today.

Today I am sober and have zero intention to use. Today I am sober and although life is not perfect I have a lot of things to lose. Today I am sober and it's sobriety I choose.

I got sober at a weird time both for me and for mankind. Just before Covid appeared. Could I have gotten through Covid still using? I honesty don't think so. I think I would have finally been successful at committing suicide and that would've been that. And what a waste that would have been! I'm no amazing human - far from it! - but choosing to end any chance of happiness and recovery would have been a tragic waste.

I remember sitting there in those first few months of sobriety terrified about what was next. Both with my new life as a sober person (and wondering if I'd even make it...) and with what was going to be left of the world post pandemic. After a while I realised the only parts of that I could control were my reactions to it. I couldn't stop the world burning down but I could motivate myself to grab a bucket of water or choose to sit back and watch the flames. What I actually decided to do after some back and forth was to just focus on what was right there in front of me. Let the world do what it was going to. So I did just that. The world is still on fire but it kinda always was anyways...

Sobriety is not and never will be the fix all to your problems. I discovered that pretty soon. It's a start. It's a first tangible step to fixing often what is a whole host of personal problems which brought us to addiction. And after that? There's hundreds and thousands of other little steps to be taken to keep us going in the right direction. Little things like making sure we have eaten breakfast so we don't get hangry and emotional which leads to cravings and bad decions, exercising to give ourselves an outlet for expression and energy, picking up new hobbies, the list goes on... The important part is knowing that putting the bong down isn't the end of our problems but it *is* the start of working through them. It *is* the start of freedom away from chemical chains.

So how did I even get to two years sober and how do I plan to continue on as a sober person? By planning and connection.

Connection is vital in sobriety. Addiction often causes us to isolate. We hide our habits due to shame and embarrassment or downplay it's hold over our lives due to fear of people judging or abandoning us. Or it's illegal and so we shouldn't even be doing it! All of these things put us to one side, apart from the rest of society and so we become more and more withdrawn and on the periphery of normal life. Hiding ourselves and things from the people we love. Which compounds the addiction even more...

Reach out. Reach out to get out. My first attempt to get sober found me here, at r/leaves. I got a sarcastic troll the first time and frankly wasn't ready then anyways but when I came back, when I was at bottom and couldn't dig no more? This place helped pull me out. There is nothing quite like finding like-minded people who understand and help you feel less alien. Less othered. Less alone. Sharing your wins and losses is bonding and life affirming. The Discord server for here has quite honestly put me in the path of people I'll probably be friends with for the rest of my life. I found a small community of people who have my back no matter what. I'm no longer alone.

Planning helps because if you already anticipate what could happen? You've got a better chance of getting a positive outcome in a situation. Knowing how to answer ""do you want to buy a bag?"" Or ""want to come round for a smoke?"" Will make your life easier. Rehearsing situations in your head ahead of time isn't stupid, it's smart! Knowing how you'll spend that first birthday, that first Christmas sober in advance will take the pressure off. So take the pressure off! Life is already hard enough.

So how did I get here and what's next? What's next is just more of the same. I'm done with smoking! I took everything there was to learn from it and now I don't need nor want to go back. Smoking helped keep me alive at a time when I couldn't cope with life in full volume and colour. With all of the sharp edges. Weed made everything fuzzy and warm. Til it fucking didn't. Til it had stripped away my personality and soul and left me broken. It became the main problem, my original problems now dwarfed by my addiction by the end.

I'm happy now. Seems trite but it's true. I have future plans, I have a partner who I adore and I have hope. Im getting married. All things I didn't have while I had weed in my life.

Lots of other people with success write lists of tips on it so to anyone who gets this far and wants to know how I got here this is it:

Speak out. Talk to people here or on the Discord server or in MA meetings or whatever. Just don't try to shoulder this alone.

Get an accountability app and journal. I used a popular sober app and quite literally watched the clock tick at first. Watched seconds pass and turn into minutes I was that bad. I found the time building motivational, the visual representation of my streak very helpful. I also used it's journal / check in function to jot down my feelings. It helped a lot! I'd recommend using a journal a lot. And therapy if you can.

Keeping busy will always help. Addictions are habits. If you finish work and come home and sit on the couch and smoke on a normal day chances are you'll have to do something else instead moving forward or else the habit will have you twitching or you'll do it on autopilot. Avoid this, break the cycle. Go for walks! Clean! Re arranging your smoking / living space will probably help too by breaking the association.

Exercise really helped me. It got me out of the house and gave me a natural mood enhancement. You may feel self-conscious at first or not think it'll help but most who try it really do recommend it.

Mindfulness and meditation. These are life savers for many and that included me. Taking ten minutes out of your day to meditate can do a world of good. The top post of this place of all time is a primer on meditation written by the founder of here, give it a read, he's 23 years sober so he knows a thing or two...

Forgiveness, patience and understanding. This is for you. You'll have fucked stuff up. Wasted years. Will want this to be over already. Hang in there. It will get better. Do not punish yourself for mistakes you can't undo. Treat yourself with as much self-compassion as you can, you *do* deserve it.

Community. Stick around. Here or Discord or whatever community you become a part of. They'll keep you on the right path and what often happens is you'll want to give back. Give back to the places that got you out of the hole. Do it. It'll never undo the damage you may have caused to your own life but it may help someone else stop ruining theirs...

Anyways, I've prattled on enough now... I  hope to see you all around soon and if you haven't already? Come visit us on Discord, I'm there every Monday and Tuesday for the 1st session and I'd love to meet you...

And as always, stay strong ♾️🤍",73

It's day 3 Sober for me, I've posted here yesterday about my day 2. Yesterday I had my first dream after months of not dreaming at all. I'm so much clear-headed and my memory is so much better.

But... With all the new energy in my body, I got injured today... I've trained very intensely the past few days at tennis which already put a lot of pressure on my shoulder, and today I traveled with a friend and I dunno why but I started showing him parkour tricks... (I was doing parkour a lot as a kid). And I did a wall spin and in the middle of the exercise, my shoulder moved a little bit out of its place.

I'm having so much pain right now and can't move my right hand otherwise I feel intense pain.
I am having thoughts on trying to get my medical cannabis license using this injury...
And I don't even want to smoke...

The weird thing is that a year ago on my month break from smoking the same happened when I over-trained serving with full force at tennis.
I guess I'm losing touch with my body when I'm getting sober after so long that I'm getting injured because I'm so full of energy and adrenaline that I lose touch with the real abilities of my past stoned body.

Weirdly,  feeling so weird right now... I hope I will be fine, I don't intend to smoke today but there are like these thoughts in my head ""if I was just smoking and chilling none of this would've happened"" or ""maybe I need cannabis as a medicine for my pain"".

Is anyone else familiar with injuries while sobering up because you act too physically suddenly?",2

I don't enjoy drinking really, so having moved to a legal area and being a noob I figured a pen was a good start. Turns out it was a good start to an easily hidden and accessible habit whenever I wanted. 

It's been about 4 years of smoking, starting with a few hits a week at its peak, then gradually escalating to the whole last year being almost every minute of every day. When I wake up, when I drive to work, at lunch, after work, when I get home, hell I'd probably smoke in my sleep if I could. I love it, and that's the issue. I love it, but I hate who I am now. I've ran in place at a dead end job for 4 years, haven't done schooling, I've followed zero passions I used to have and no longer do probably due to laziness. I get off work, start smoking and then do nothing.. Rinse and repeat. No motivation for anything else. The sad thing is, it's the only thing I find myself looking forward to when the workday is coming to an end, even though I'm still coming down from the high at lunch. 

I'm well aware of how bad it is, and I've ""quit"" several times, throwing away the pen and all only to find myself stressed and going straight back to it but even harder. I work graveyards which makes it even harder on the weekends when its just me and my thoughts at 2am. As I write this, I'm relatively sober sitting on the couch staring at my 7th or 8th ""last cartridge"" on the counter debating whether I should throw it away or finish it off. It's a cycle I want to get out of soon and venting here is just the beginning I hope.",5

2022-02-12 11:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sqvxns/65_days_sober/,65 days sober,"I haven’t felt like I needed weed the last few weeks. Friend offered to smoke and hang, and i am tempted but after reading through the posts in leaves, it just reminded me of all the issues I faced.
1. “Just gonna do it once”, the problem is that if you’ve already reached an addictive point with weed before, it can easily happen again. Some people are just wired to be addicted, and it definitely applies to me
2. Lack of sharpness and dullness of personality. It’s not noticeable until after ive been smoking quite a bit but at some point my mind wasn’t as sharp as before. My personality was basically gone, I didnt really care about how my time was spent, everything was “fine” with me as long as i was high, which meant i would just default to doing the bare minimum path if least resistance activities like watching tv or playing games. My emotions lacked range, i either felt “up” or “down”, there was no real nuance with what i experienced, it felt like i wasn’t really alive.
3. Cost and time. Weed gets expensive especially when you are doing it everyday. As tolerance builds up, you need more and more to get high, and the highs aren’t even as enjoyable as that first high. At some point it felt like i was smoking just to smoke, which also took up a ton of time with copping, cleaning, maintenance, all the little things you don’t think about but add up on time. Safe to say the thousands of dollars spent on weed every year could have went to better things. Also it emphasizes that weed really wasnt meant to be done that often, our bodies physically will adjust to making it less effective with more use.
4. Feeling that life is flying by. When high, it feels like time is moving really slowly sometimes but when i look back at the previous 1.5 years of getting high every day, i dont really remember much of what i did, i dont feel like i did anything. I was just a passive person going through the motions of life, there but not really alive.
5. Withdrawal and quitting…again. When I did stop two months ago, that first week was horrible. My sleep schedule was completely random, couldn’t sleep much at night and felt like napping during the day, everything felt like a daze. My dreams came back, except it was all intense nightmares that really scared the hell out of me. And then there were the intense cravings for 3-5 days after stopping, I  kept thinking about getting some weed and felt so depressed that i didnt want to do anything else. 
And something about getting past the first week was so so hard, harder then the next 7 weeks i did. Every time Ive tried to quit weed, this has happened, it seems to be an uphill battle with a very steep climb every relapse.
Withdrawal symptoms did calm down after the first week, but my sleep schedule and mood and motivation was completely messed up the first three weeks. If i was to start again, it would mean the potential of going through all of this again.

With reflection, i cant say that my life has radically changed since i stopped two months ago but im definitely less anxious and paranoid now. I feel more control of myself and my life. I used weed to escape life and calm down but eventually it became a source of anxiety that made it harder to actually deal with and enjoy life. I still have a small desire to smoke weed even after knowing all of this but i keep myself going by seeing other people’s experiences and telling myself that i can always do it later but not today.",14
2022-02-12 11:38:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sqvh78/3rd_year_anniversary_of_quitting_weed/,3rd Year Anniversary of Quitting Weed,"Yesterday was my 3rd year anniversary of quitting smoking weed.

I went from a child of the ""Just Say No"" 80s to a medical marijuana advocate and avid gardener in my 40s. I gave seeds away, I taught others how to grow it, I gave speeches and told stories extolling its virtues. I grew pounds of it every year, and made a lot of money doing it. I had a brief business selling homemade edibles, until I got held up at gunpoint by my customers. (Although I still think that was a fake gun.)

Being stoned had become my new normal, and without being stoned I was unhappy and irritable all the time. I couldn't just smoke less, because I had become dependent on the plant to just feel OK.

It took me a couple of years to realize I needed help to quit it for good. When I enrolled in Kaiser outpatient rehab, I still had 3 pounds of homegrown trimmed bud in the closet. The therapist at Kaiser said I should get rid of it. ""No way, that's a few thousand dollars' worth!"" I said. She said, ""You can't smoke it if it's not in front of you."" I didn't throw it out, I sold it all year long, all while doing my rehab. But I didn't smoke any of it ever again. At my rehab I was quite open about this. They all doubted me and smirked. But, I persevered. I quit smoking that day and never smoked it again.

I didn't like the 12-Step mantra of declaring myself an addict. Why identify with the thing you are trying NOT to be? I felt. ""I'm not an weed addict,"" I said, ""I'm a vegetarian!"" I had quit eating meat when I was 11 years old, so I felt this was a more accurate self-identification.

Now 3 years later, that is still true. (Well, I do eat fish.)

Now I'm doing better without it, and although I had some good times, I don't miss being a slave to that plant.

I encourage anyone who wants to quit to keep on trying. Sometimes it takes a few tries before you can quit it for good. I highly encourage you to get group support if you can. Going to groups, outpatient rehab, and outside meetings were very effective for me.",51

How to stop smoking weed from a stoner.,"i love this sub and it has helped me immensely in the journey of letting go of the beautiful herb that we unfortunately abused. Marijuana is a beautiful herb, once abused though, it will slow you down, mask your personality, and you will stay stagnant. For years, it helped me evolve into a peaceful person. To develop different perspectives, and enjoying my lonesome- which I appreciate. Again- once abused it becomes dangerous. I wanted to defeat the stereotypical “stoner.” So I was an “active stoner.” I worked out high, Jiu Jitsu high, boxing high, and then got to studying high, being around family high- and then I forgot who I was sober. Very dangerous. I’m sure many of you can relate to this. It got to the point however, where life wasn’t going anywhere. I’m a grad student and I was getting slower , memory was fucked, and feeling pessimistic about everything. That’s not the way to live. So I decided to stop. And this is how I did it, and will keep doing it and hope to inspire those on this sub the same way y’all did.  I went on a week bender- to completely hate smoking. Then I started. What has helped me.  I told myself I’ll give myself 75 days.  10 weeks. A fighter training camp. Tell yourself during this time you will become the best version of yourself. Remove that inner bitch. By any means necessary. 

1) develop a militant routine.  Sleep and wake up at the same time. Whatever time you decide on waking up. Wake up. Get a workout in. Have a good breakfast. Stack your habits that way they keep you busy till you sleep. For me- I wake up, so I can gym, so I can shower, so I can have breakfast, so I can go to the library and study, so I can do Jiu Jitsu at 6/7pm, so I can sleep at 9pm. (First week is hard, progress is addicting) 

2) eat good. First week might be tough with food. But who cares you won’t die. It will get better with working out a lot. When you can eat, eat right. Cook your own food. Even if the same 3 meals everyday. I eat oatmeal and omelet for breakfast. Chicken, steak, potatoes for dinner. Everyday. If you’re going to eat out- eat Chipotle. Who cares if you eat the same thing everyday- food is fuel. Don’t be picky, you’re trying to become the best version of yourself rn, be strict. Don’t cheat yourself. 

2) delete Instagram- on the journey of evolving and becoming a better version of yourself. Nobody should know. You shouldn’t care what anybody is doing either. It’s a distraction, and it’s fake. Worry about you.  Become a savage. Evolve. Don’t delete the app either , deactivate your account- don’t worry it won’t deactivate  forever. You’ll eventually realIze life is a lot more real than the gram and you won’t activate it again. Don’t get fomo. Everyone has there own path , appreciate your journey. 

3) feel your emotions- you’re going to be happy, sad, stressed, irritable, you’ll cry sometimes, be depressed some other days. Feel those emotions, recognize them. Your brain will tell you to go to the clinic, it’s so easy to just take a hit and be okay for an hour. But remember it’s you vs you. Don’t cheat yourself.

4) dopamine- we are a bag of chemicals controlled by dopamine. Learn something new, exercise  a lot. Try a new form of exercise that you always wanted to try. Jiu Jitsu, boxing, yoga, Pilates. (Andrew huberman podcast is a great place to start for learning about developing these dopamine receptors) 
 
Some tips. Everyday after you’ve successfully made it one day without weed, and accomplishing your goals for the day. For example for me. It’s day 36 of (waking up at 5 am everyday, working out, eating right, studying, and sleeping on time) you cross one day off your calendar. Everyday you accomplish your goals that you set out from the beginning of the journey you cross out the day. Crossing off the days become addicting and you never want to break that streak. I’m on day 36 right now and I can’t wait to sleep and cross it off tomorrow and write day 37. 

- it’s going to be hard, it’s supposed to be hard. You’re going to have days of wanting to do nothing but lay on your bed and watch Netflix. That’s fine. If you woke up and didn’t smoke that day, it’s a success regardless. And tell yourself that but recognize you’ll get back on it the next day. It’s you vs you. Ain’t nobody else watching. Nobody gives a fuck. Evolve into the best version of yourself. You deserve it. You deserve to see what you can become. We all going to die anyway, so just go out and do it. Become a savage.",70

I had quit drinking and all other party drugs about 31 months ago, but had kept smoking the herb until Xmas eve of last year.  So that puts me around 50 days completely sober (no more California sober bs).  It was such a good time, it made me question why I thought I needed all these substances to enjoy concerts.  Obviously I didn’t need them to enjoy the shows, but it always felt like a prerequisite, and it always was a chore for before a concert.   Had to get the joints rolled and stuffed in my pants, had to get the herb, had to worry about being caught on the way in.  Had to sneak the bowl in my shoe.  Had to sneak the lighter past the metal detector.  A lot of pre-show stress, then having to be sneaky while trying to blaze, especially during indoor shows, not so much at big outdoor concerts as we all know.  It all made it seem like some wild ride, but it was more of a distraction and chore than anything else.  But last night was an absolute blast, so much fun that I’m going back for more tonight!  And another one next weekend! Some people ask me when I tell them I’m sober “is anything fun anymore? Can you do all the crazy things you used to do wasted, sober?” And the answer is a resounding yes.  I didn’t do all those things and participate in that culture because of the drugs and alcohol, I did it because it’s what I love to do.  Live music is and always will be a huge part of my life, and it’s even better now that I’m sober!!!",10

2022-02-12 09:45:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sqt291/1st_month_over/,1st Month over,"So I'm in week six right now and I just thought I could write down my experience down up till now.
I (23F) smoked for 5-6 years. Everyday since almost the beginning. At first weed seemed like the perfect drug to me: I was able to socialize more (of course just with all the other stoners at my school) and the most important thing was that it numbed me. The numbing-thing is something I just happened to realize in the end. 
After two years of smoking I already realized I might have a problem with weed. But my boyfriend and most of my friends smoked at least as much as me and didn't seem to have a problem. Then my boyfriend was caught by police for dealing with weed, so we've been sober for half a year. Didn't like it. 
Long story short, we split up and I was still a daily smoker (year 3). And with every month more I started to realize more and more that I REALLY have a problem with weed. All my social stuff happened to be sorrounded by weed. Selfmoderation didn't work. Quitting seemed impossible so instead I did breaks. And after the breaks I always smoked double for a while.
Last year I started therapy and ended it after a few months because it felt pointless. I just wasn't able to focus on a topic. Instead problematic topics changed almost daily.
I started to notice that weed wasn't only bead for my mind, but for my body too. I had problems with almost-fainting here and there and I had so fucking many nights in which I just couldn't sleep.
That + the feeling to never be able to know what my actual problems are set the ultimate trigger to stop. In the end I was just annoyed by myself and all my excuses so I just did it.

So how was the first month sober?
To be honest... It was good. Good and hard in beginning. The first two weeks I made sure to not meet up with anyone weed-related because I couldn't trust myself not to smoke. After that I started to feel more stable (not everyday, but on a fucking lot more days than before). And I started to feel, dream and focus. To be honest, keeping  focus is still a problem on some days but that just might be my fucking ADHD and that's ok.
But you know what's the best thing? Time feels real again. Days are different. Good ones, bad ones, stressed ones, lazy ones, energetic ones... It's fucking awesome to feel... Alive.
Now I even feel strong enough to say No. Which I will do tonight.

So to everyone who struggles with whether they might be strong enough: Yes you are. You might slip. But you definitely are strong enough to get up again. 

And being alive is fucking great!",13

I was speaking with a fellow business owner the other day about my businesses. He commented, ""Wow! Looks like you got everything figured out!""

I replied, ""I've got NOTHING figured out."" (He, of course, did not know what I was really referring to, and looked at me with a confused expression.)

I've chased success, and all the trappings of, pretty much my whole life. Externally, I look like a success: I own multiple businesses, my name is highly recognized in my community, and money is easy. 

But I feel empty. 

I am now starting to question the values I've chosen. 

Quite honestly, I get more joy from reading a good book or playing a board game than I do from any of my external successes. 

I won't blame social media or societal expectations or any of that other bullshit that shifts the blame - I instead fully blame myself. I blame myself for chasing what I thought would bring me happiness, ignoring all the warning signs along the way. 

The warning signs were clear as fucking day: Smoking weed, as well as other means of escaping from the emptiness. Escaping from the lack of fulfillment in my life.   

I'm getting that now. I am understanding that now. 

I've got my issues to work on, and they are fully and wholly my responsibility to resolve. 

It took me years to fuck up my life - now it's time to accept that it may take years to adopt new values and create a better life for myself and my loved ones. I have a choice to make: Hide from the consequences of my life choices or face the inherent challenges associated with forging a new path forward. 

If anyone reads this post, my hope is that is may spark in you the motivation to examine the whys behind your cannabis consumptions, or any other form of escapism. My thesis is that if you are truly fulfilled, then there would be no reason to escape your reality. There would be no reason to mask your reality in a dull mental haze. 

I wish you all internal and intrinsic success <3",31

I used those days literally to lay in bed, eat garbage and watch netflix all day. I don’t answer my phone when I’m high cause I get socially anxious. So when I come down from it and finally answer messages, I have to make up excuses and end up lying to a bunch of people I care about.

(This is my take on the 12 questions of Marijuana Anonymous. Their version ends with ""If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you may have a problem with marijuana"".)


My name is Joe. I can safely say I used to answer yes to all of these, and yes, I am definitely a marijuana addict. I can also say I used to choose it over school, work, money, family, relationships, sanity, comfort, cleanliness, safety, and a place to sleep. I chose to be completely not-a-dollar-in-my-pocket broke, dirty, homeless, and friendless. I lost everything, endangered my safety, and risked my life way too often before I quit.

I'm so happy I decided to chose life. Now I choose every single day to not smoke that day. Somehow, those days added up to 8 months and 12 days. I am forever grateful to be free from weed and to somehow slowly but surely regain all those things I lost, and more. I have an apartment, I interviewed for a job today, and in a month and two weeks I'll finally have an associates degree I've worked on since 2017. And I have really nice friends that like hanging out with me just to talk and chill, without weed. How?!? What??!?

It seemed so impossible in the beginning, but now, I can really do it. Being stoned was a torturous nightmare. Getting sober is an incredible miracle. I still find it so hard sometimes to honestly believe that I'm here. But if I can do it, anyone can do it. This is Joe and I'm rooting for you.",14

Day 2-14: This is when the anger starts to set in for me. Little things set me off. Just really, obscenely irritable. Bored, listless, and restless. A few sleepless nights, waking up sweaty as hell. 

Day 15 - 25: Anger is now much easier to cope with. Emotional, however, like a stupid video with emotional music will make me cry. 

Day 26-42: Brain is feeling sharper each day. Emotions are stable. Sleeping is getting easier. Generally feeling pretty good. 

I am now somewhere around day 52 and I have been feeling very motivated each day to take action on things like working out and learning the skills I am interested in. I get tempted to smoke again sometimes but I just remember how shitty it is to feel trapped in the haze, unable to stop, the paranoia, the anxiety. Getting high is a lie, its more like getting low. 

Anyways, weed sucks unless its helping a medical condition. Its not recreational, because recreation is fun and weed is not fun, it's a burden.

Been lurking for quite some time and reading everyone’s stories and feeling really inspired to leave this chapter of my life behind but I can’t seem to do it.. 

I smoked pot for the first time in middle school and only took a handful of puffs throughout high school. It wasn’t until I got to college until I truly discovered the supposed beauty of Mary Jane. She’s always been an influence in my life, be it unknowingly. She was in almost all the music I listened to! She was the reason why my grandfather was always in a good mood around me! It just took a while for me to find out. 

I’m now two years out of college and two years into a serious relationship. The one that could last forever kind of serious… and I’m realizing it’s doing nothing but harm. I smoke every day and night and have for the past 4 years or so. My partner talks about how distant I’ve become at times as I unknowingly tripled my intake recently. Makes perfect fuckin sense to me! It’s gotta go! And I’ve known it for a while. But Whenever I think of quitting all I can think of are two things…

- how much money id save, get my energy back, dreams!, not be an emotionless blob half the time, etc.
- wow. Why would I ever quit?

And the latter always wins.

If I’m being honest I just know how much I’m gonna miss this feeling of escape. But you can’t run forever, and I’m overweight to begin with so I can’t run very far… I’m sure this comes off as rambly and annoying, but I just felt like this was the place to air my frustrations, if there ever was one. Could use some encouragement probably. Or advice. I already quit nicotine last year. So I feel like I could pull this off!",2

I just stood there and cried, something that was ingrained in me from me from a young age that men shouldn’t do. I then flushed all the weed that I just purchased without smoking any of it which I have never done. Yeah a waste of money but so what. And I don’t care if I cry every day and night for the next month if that’s what it takes. 

Even though weed withdrawal isn’t as bad withdrawal from other substances that I’ve been through it still has the same detrimental effects on my life because I use it for the same reason of numbing emotions and escaping. It’s time to face those feelings and problems.

I have known for maybe last 2.5 years that i have had a problem. I have been doing it for about 10 years now, daily for about 4 years now. 

I first started smoking back when i was 17 with friends from school, occasionally, but i took to the habit right away. Now im 27, about to get married, running a business and need to stop. 

When i went to college, i would smoke also. It would give me motivation and perspective when i needed it. It never really affected my grades, overall only had like 3 B's the rest were A's. As i got busier with school i would smoke less, but still consuming regularly. Overall, I was successful having published my biochemistry research and doing the things I wanted. I could have been more social and spent less of my down time smoking by myself, but thats hindsight. 

After finishing school,  I started a software company. I would work by myself, and have remote employees, access to a vape pen. I would often vape 1g of oil every week, mostly doing sativa, but sometimes hybrid. 

I would often smoke a lot to deal with the stress of working and investing, which is also a big part of my job. I would smoke often to deal with the stress of investing and give me motivation or a push to work on the software and not worry. Im no longer really worried about the investing stuff and need to live more positively now.

It became a serious problem to the point where I know its stopping me from operating at the level I need to. Its impacting the way im managing the software project and also the team. 

Im able to study while high, and would often smoke while studying for hard financial/math exams. These are competitive exams for work, over past 3 years i have done 2, creating a bad habit of interferring with work. I would know while studying that I could learn faster and better if sober, but would use it as motivation to study and to worry about withdrawl/decreased focus. It was here that i realized I had a problem.

After a while, i began doing it everyday, ~8-12 times a day, first thing in the morning and throughout the day. 1g of vape cartridge a week.

Its beginning to have a bad affect on my focus, motivation, makes me irritable with family sometimes, ability to get work done decreases and over saturates my brain with too much stimulus. 

Im going to try to redirect this energy into exercising (something i do daily), journalling, playing games, and my software business. 

Im going on vacation/business trip in a few days and will stop smoking then (no access). I will use this as an opportunity for a new beginning and get rid of everything before. Im excited for the trip as I have cool opportunities lined up that I hope work out.

Im looking forward to rediscovering myself and not hiding myself under this. Im getting married this year, want to focus more on my business and want to live a better life. Thank you all!",4

I feel so weak when I relapse. I think my reasons for quitting may not be strong enough. My only real reason for wanting to quit is my fear of damaging my brain permanently. I don’t want to be dumb. I feel like I already I am. I don’t want to fuck up my brain forever. But if that wasn’t a concern I really don’t think I’d have any desire to quit. My main reason for smoking is my crippling mental illness. It’s an escape. It make life a little more tolerable and allows me to finally chill out for a little bit. I am going to a psychiatrist and eventually therapy. What caused me to relapse in the first place was my psychiatrist appointment getting pushed back to a month away. It’s just hard for me to live like like this. I don’t want to be okay one day and have permanently fucked myself up though. I don’t want to be even less intelligent.
My plan right now is to continue smoking in moderation, not daily, until my appointment. I’m scared I won’t be able to stop then though. I’m able to stop for a little bit but never for long because I miss being high so much. I can’t even enjoy other hobbies or find something to replace it with because I have such crippling anxiety.

Yesterday I had super low energy and was basically procrastinating the whole day. I also felt super sad and like I was going to get sick.
Then at nighttime I got my period which explains a lot of this stuff. But also the having been on a trip and not being able to recharge in my usual way (introspective smoking) to recover from a LOT of social interaction the previous days was way harder than expected.

I'm lucky that my husband is on the same journey (but wasn't nearly as addicted as I am) so I verbalized my cravings and sadness and he is being super supportive.

Today I got back to a cabinet makeover I'm doing and the mere physical activity and attention it required made me feel better. 

But I don't appreciate the feeling that it seems that I have to be 100% occupied physically and mentally to not think about wanting to smoke. I'd like to be able to relax too without thinking about weed and being anxious about never being able to smoke again.

I get these thoughts that ""well, you're doing great so you definitely can smoke again"" immediately followed by ""but why would you smoke again if you're doing well?"". The first days I was very determined and now I'm just more confused and struggling. 
I still am waking up very tired although I sleep a lot. But then again, could be my period. Thank you female body for the eternal struggle of ""am I sick, depressed and generally useless or is it just my uterus being an absolute dick?""

I'll just have to wait it out and see what's what in a few days.",3

Before I quit after 20 min I was kind of bored and not ""feeling it"" but my first workout I went for over 40 min and wanted to keep going because it felt so good and I was really really into my music.

I got myself a doc appointment and had a mental health assessment done. I've been depressed since I was in my early teens (I had a rough childhood) and hid in drugs and alcohol ever since. After completing the assessment I was able to get prescribed medication to help me deal with whats going on.

Above all else, I am proud for not caving in. My girlfriend still smokes (not my story to tell, I support her with her choice, I'll leave it as that). There's still a decent amount at home, and I work from home she doesn't. I haven't caved. I can smell it when she smokes, hell she'll sometimes smoke right in front of me, and it doesn't do anything. I just don't want it any more, the idea, the thought, of smoking weed right now honestly makes me feel sick. I remember that last time I had some and felt like crap. I didn't enjoy it at all.

I want to lucid dream again, I want to learn new skills, I want to take my career in a new direction and I feel a drive for that I haven't ever felt. I'm on track to becoming a newer, better me, and I'll never fucking let some dried up plant get in my way.

I never did the AA thing, I tried but it was pretty hard with my social anxiety. Eventually after countless tries of quitting alcohol on my own it just kind of stuck.

This is the worst part for me because it comes out in small increments and I’m nervous this will cause gastro issues eventually (mind you, i previously got gastritis from smoking too much in 2020 and it took me 6 months to recover from that and i just don’t wanna go through anything like that again). To anyone else who has struggled with bowel movement when quitting, what did you do to get things going? Did you just keep smoking less and less until your body wasn’t dependent or does your bowels eventually get back to normal after a while of not smoking?

I seem to get hung up around the 3 month mark. My most recent relapses I haven't made it much more than 2 weeks. I've used for about 15 years. I've got kids, job, and wife. My most recent quit attempts have failed because I felt like I wasn't enjoying the day to day (2 weeks really isn't long enough to flush out the THC... I just didn't get through that phase). I always get motivated to quit because I can sense my appreciation for food waning, nausea beginning to set in, and a lack of effect from the pot. My most recent relapse began probably about 2 - 3 weeks ago.  


I'm most successful when I force myself to begin sobriety with early wake up and exercise. It's a challenge to hold myself accountable due to morning nausea and lack of appetite throughout the day...  


Having gone through this cycle a dozen plus times I feel like I'm beginning to doubt my capability to follow through on my desire to \_actually\_ quit for real. I feel like I need someone to help hold me accountable. My wife would be happy to do it, but when I have a strong craving (usually fueled by chaos at work or something) i tend to get fairly tunnel minded and believe that I have the willpower to just rip through a joint and be done (it's never true).

I keep hearing you can’t be addicted to weed or THC, but it really feels like I am, and I can’t find support I’m really feeling like I need. I will be frank that I do have an addictive personality, I had a decent issue with a certain drug that rips all the joy and serotonin out of your soul (if you know what I’m talking about), and it was miserable quitting. I picked up dabs shortly after, and had only smoked flower before.

Now over a year later, I’m smoking three times a day, I feel like crap all the time, and my sleep is awful. I think my breaking point though has come after I just got over Covid two months ago. Anytime I take a dab now my chest feels like crap, my head hurts, and I’m not enjoying it. Yet it’s like in my mind I can’t stop, it’s like this routine that I have to do and if I don’t I’m irritable and depressed and get headaches. I’m surprised I guess by my mental inability to just stop. I never thought I’d need to be convincing myself to just stop, and certainly didn’t think I would have the mentality that I can’t. 

I stopped for two days, and felt like I was losing it. So today I threw all the stuff away, and I’m just going for it because I think it’s just time for a reset. Any tips or things that might help with this transition? I feel like a drug addict I can’t explain it any other way.",1

I'm not going back to weed, and I'm continuing to be sober moving forward. I just wanted to make this post to hold myself accountable for this usage and keep myself committed to being weed free moving forward. I will not let a new -- really an old -- weed habit take hold and spiral into inevitable addiction. I chose to take a hit last night out of my own volition and I'm not beating myself up over it.

Or maybe that was for videogames. No sure. The two were kind of related in an escapism bundle. Either way, that reset can't get here fast enough. It's only day 6 and things have been getting better and worse at both extremes. There's very little neutral emotional time left, even at night; dreams and nightmares are a lot more vivid and I repeatedly wake up for seemingly no reason.

The only stable time left is that hour at the dog park. I love that place. First because dogs, and second I get to talk to people without me knowing them and them knowing me; it's like an escape from myself. Can't spend all day at the dog park though. I have more responsibilities than I can handle and I can't simply quit either of them.

I used to smoke 2-4 times a day, every day. My latest craze was to supplement with oils for an even bigger kick since my tolerance has been going up over the past two years. Or maybe it just seemed that way. I quit cold turkey 6 days ago and so far I hate it.

I have a girlfriend, but she's no real help. She's very self centered; didn't even realize I had an addiction despite living with me the entire time. I confronted her about it. She seemed to empathize in the moment and promised to try and care about something other than herself but, so far, it's only been talk and no action.

Therapists are quite expensive these days. I make enough to not qualify for any payment assistance but not enough to actually afford it. Even if I could, the thought of paying a stranger to pretend to care about my petty ass problems is just.... weak. I'm a 28 y/o man in a first world country ffs.

i’m 20, severe ADHD, depression and severe  anxiety 

 i found weed at 18 and was INSTANTLY hooked, i finally didn’t have my ADHD screaming at me or bad thoughts, i was able to be present and enjoy a moment. 

unfortunately i got really addicted to weed because how much it helped me through my hardest days. bad day? weed. bad thought? weed. this was it for 2 years straight. 

i lost my girlfriend because i put weed over her and it really really beats me up, all i ever wanted to do was to be high or smoking 24/7 and understandably that wasn’t her scene. 

now my mental health is at the worst it’s ever been and i’ve noticed the amount i’m smoking to deal with how i feel each day, im smoking around 42g in the space of 11/12 days, it’s hard rn and i’m abusing it plus my wallet.

i don’t think weed is the problem, it’s my relationship to weed. i’m not using it at a tool to see a new perspective on life, to be creative or to be social. i’m only smoking to not feel like i want to end it my life.

i need to step away from weed to find other solutions to make myself feel happy and safe in my own mind 

so here i go, starting day 1 today. hope i manage to heal myself a little and find new strategies to overcome hurdles

I used to live my life basically waiting for the next time I could smoke. It was the favourite part of my day, the part where I could relax and forget about things.

Now I have to constantly think of things to do to pass the time. I have to come up with goals for myself I don't really care about to just occupy my life because otherwise I have to sit and think and I hate it

I'm still chasing dopamine hits, but now I just have to replace them with 'good' types of dopamine hits like exercise and working toward goals. Why are those hits good but weed is bad? I have to be a normal person and I fucking hate it.

Eat healthy, exercise, meet new people, work towards goals. Fuck off. Why does my dumb little brain have to follow such a strict set of parameters to feel content? I hate the way my brain works

I 'quit' about a week ago I think (I can't remember). I've had a collection of stinging rogers I've been smoking to ween me off but even those little fuckers are my favourite part of the day now.

As the title suggests, my best friend and I are now one month sober and loving it so I just wanted to share the love with all of you.

Tldr: I stopped smoking weed and now I write lengthy, verbose and braggadocious reddit posts and I like it.

For context; we smoked almost daily for the last ten years from around the age of 16.

We realised weed was holding us back a long time ago (as I'm sure a lot of you have/had realised too), but couldn't build up the courage to make the change for the longest time.

We always told ourselves that while weed was bad, it was still a better alternative to facing the anxiety and depression we've both suffered from over the years (which was probably exacerbated greatly by the amount of weed we smoked).

Here's some of the things I've noticed since quitting:

- My sleep patterns have normalized massively, although admittedly it was tough for the first week or two. 
(It's a lot harder to stay up until 5am gaming every weekend without some encouragement).

- My overall appetite and energy levels have bounced back strongly. 
I used to struggle to ""find the time"" to cook proper meals so I'd just graze on munchies late at night (plus it was hard to eat during the day if I was sober).

- We're now much better friends to the rest of our friend group as we can now hang out at the drop of a hat.
I avoided driving stoned even though ""I felt fine"" because it's basically the same as drunk driving honestly. (Plus when I was stoned I normally didn't feel like socializing or going out anyway so it was a convenient excuse).

- We're finally doing interesting things to get that natural dopamine hit like when we were just young bucks.

Things like:

• Heading to the river after work most days like we used to do back in school (southern hemisphere so it's summer at the moment).

• Going on hikes and camping with our old friend group.

• Trivia nights at the pub.

• We're looking at joining a local sports team as we were both fairly active in school but somehow tricked ourselves into thinking we didn't want to do it any more so we could spend more time blazing.

• I'm learning a new language and have picked up the guitar and keyboard again as I was incredibly unmotivated to cultivate any hobbies or skills for years.

• I've even started writing down jokes and ideas again. (I really lost my spark after numbing my brain for too long so it's great to have that feeling again).




I can't say I don't miss Mary because that would be a lie. Getting to the top of a mountain after a hike and not being able to light up a celebratory joint is certainly bittersweet for example. 

I just have to remind myself that I wouldn't have climbed the mountain in the first place if I was still smoking and that brings me peace of mind.


My emotions are now running rampant which is good and bad obviously. The highs are much higher but the lows sure are lower. 
I guess it's just a matter of taking the good with the bad, but I've found my mental fortitude has increased so I'm able to weather those storms knowing that better days are always on the horizon if I'm prepared to embrace them.

I also have to remember that I get stronger each day I'm able to resist the siren song of sweet Mary Jane.



Overall I don't regret the change. I'd like to think I can go back to having a joint on a Sunday afternoon in the distant future, but I've still got a lot of work to do and foundations to lay if I ever want to walk in both worlds.

Apologies for the rather lengthy essay, I guess I just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else needed a little nudge in the right direction like we did not too long ago.

Good luck out there and thanks for all your words of wisdom to help leads these two blind fools to the light.",7

I'm unbelievably proud y'all! And very grateful for the help I received! It's amazing how some internet strangers can help you pull through the tough times. And every day I add on to the sober streak makes going back to my addiction more futile, because I didn't get this far to only get this far!

Hope you guys are all doing well and accomplishing your goals. I posted here last year when I took a tolerance break and you guys were all really awesome and encouraging. A lot of good things have happened in the last year and I'm finally at a point in my life where I am happy. I've been consistently going to the gym and have gotten into the best shape of my life. Things are going great with the ladies and I finally graduated college here in Michigan. I'm 25 years old and have been smoking since I was 15, a sophomore in high school. When I took my break last year I immediately realized the side effects and was overwhelmed to say the least. No appetite, couldn't sleep, really bad anxiety and all that good stuff. I even ended up in the ER after about the 3rd or 4th day and could not stop vomiting. I use weed as a crutch and know I'm addicted to it. Can't look forward to something without it. Got to have it post whatever it is I'm doing. Last year when I took that break I was immediately reminded of the personality I had when I wasn't smoking, and I'm a much more anxious, angry person who overthinks even the smallest of things. Everyone in my life knows me as a calm person who doesn't take things too seriously. A lot of this (or all of it) has to do with the content mental place weed puts me in. Which brings me here to this post. I plan to finally give it up permanently this weekend and this time not for a job interview. I'm at a huge conflict though because I really do like the person I am more when I am smoking. I love not overthinking and being content with stupid shit that would normally ruin my day. My anxiety, while probably made worse from my weed withdrawal, exists and I really hate the person I am sober. I know this sounds like a mental gymnastic type thing that someone who does not want to give something up would say, but I'm so conflicted here. I want to stop smoking. I want to able to enjoy things again sober and not have to spend my money on weed to have something to look forward to. At the same time however I don't even know if the person I am sober would be able to appreciate these things without some sort of anxiety medication or meditation. I truly believe that I either have to stop cold turkey, or be an addict and have to have weed in my possession 24/7. Would love to hear some advice from you guys. Thanks everyone.

Should I wait it out in hope of improvement or is it not normal to feel this bad?,"After 5 years of heavily abusing weed (had breaks when hospitalized and drug tested, but consistently besides that) I quit 12 days ago. The first few days felt odd, but not terrible. Then about a week ago things REALLY took a turn. I havent left my bed since, have super disordered sleep, and feel so negative about my life and the world that I am now experiencing some disturbing thoughts. I ended up dropping all of my classes as well and almost left home to live in my car, both very out of character for me.

I've read some accounts on this sub of people feeling clear headed and amazing after 10 days, but it seems things have snowballed for me to the point where I cant function and take care of myself. I also have mental health issues beyond weed addiction and take medication for them, which is why I am not sure whether to wait it out or reach out about possibly adding on medication.

Based on any of your experiences, is it possible this is a result of the thc detox and could subside with a few more days? Or are these symptoms too severe to be attributed to weed detox alone? 

Thanks in advance and I want to clarify I am not seeking medical advice, only guidance based on your own experiences. It is unhelpful approaching my doctor about this because of how little he understands about weed, so I just want to know whether withdrawal often lasts past a couple weeks.",1

Out of sight out of mind is a big motivator for my sobriety, so maybe that’s why I don’t like seeing posts about weed (even if they are about the horrors of it and quitting). I want to be sober but I don’t want to constantly think about it or make it a big deal.

I've been smoking heavily every day since 2017, and now that I'm moving to a new state, I think it's time for a new (sober) state of being as well. I cried reading a lot of these posts, you're all amazing.

I recently figured out that I not only get to my most anxious points when smoking, but that it is the reason I feel in pain a lot of the time. As a hypochondriac, you could guess how bad those two mixed. A few weeks ago, I was dry for 7 days and noticed just how better my body felt over all. I had energy, I didn't even think about being in pain or if I was sick. I spent a lot of last year visiting urgent cares just to confirm I wasn't dying. Those 7 days felt like the pure definition of clarity, and like it was nothing, I smoked as soon as I had the availability. I went back to the pain and anxiety overnight, and I was honestly furious with myself. Yet here I was, packing a cone every night anyway. I feel out of control, like any sort of will I had, had evaporated completely.

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to start a sober journal. To write how being sober made me feel every day, whether good or bad. Does anyone think that would be helpful with quitting? I am very clearly addicted, and I see no way out right now, so any advice to make the transition to a sober life better would be greatly appreciated.

I'm so proud of everyone in this group, and the obstacles you overcame to get to where you are today, whether you're on day 1 or 100, you're amazing. Thank you for listening.",6

This is my third attempt in 2 years to quit. Surprisingly, the physical withdrawal symptoms (i.e.: sleep problems, appetite loss, sweating) havent been all that bad this time around. I got over them fully pretty much after day 7. 

However, my mental health has plummeted which has not happened in my previous two attempts. I feel incredibly anxious 24/7. Brain fog is unbearable. And i feel like i have zero control over my emotions causing wild mood swings and rage outbursts.

This has lead to a brutal 3 days. Im sure my college classes and the stress that comes with them is somewhat to blame. Ive pretty much slept probably well over 30hrs in a three day period after not sleeping at all on day 8 (i associate this with the stress rather than the weed withdrawal) i just ate my first meal in 2 days. 

I also lost control on my girlfriend of 8 years last night which is not like me at all. I honestly feel kinda depressed and out of control. I dont feel like myself. Im really not sure if this is the weed withdrawal or my smoking habit was covering up an underlying depression.

So, im simply wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience after quitting. I love this community and i guess im also kinda reaching out for some words of encouragement as well. Its been a really rough week.",1

I’m on day 4 of no smoking after smoking daily since I was 16 years old. I’ve spent practically my entire adult life high and it got to the point where I could smoke 2-3 blunts and literally feel nothing from it. I have smoked a few crumbs in moments of weakness but I haven’t broken down and texted my dealer which is a really really big deal for me (I have never gone more than a day without smoking, never even taken a t-break.)

Honestly it has been really rough so far and I’m realizing how much I relied on weed for every part of my life. If I was happy, I’d smoke. If I was sad, I’d smoke. If I was angry, I’d smoke. No matter what I was feeling, I would smoke.

I’ve been feeling so tired and depressed, I had to take a sick day from work on the second day because I felt so horrible. My sleeping and eating have surprisingly been okay but I probably think to myself “I want a blunt” 100x a day lol, but I haven’t given in and I’m so proud. 

Thank you to everyone here - leaves gave me the motivation to acknowledge that I needed to quit even though I’m “doing well” in life and has helped me feel less alone throughout all of this. Wishing you all the best on your journeys and I hope to post a more positive update soon :)",5

Never ever be around potheads, don't even think about that u will lose 100%
Workout alot sweat out that thc and get yourself exhausted so u can sleep more, days will go by faster which is what we want.
Give your money/wallet to someone close to u (no money no weed)
Take Hot baths everyday it's good for stress and pain relief.
Help others to get sober this will motivate u and will also get u to heaven aswell ( sounds like a good deal to me 😃)
Cook high quality meals for yourself every day.

On day 217 today. feeling good.

The amount of clarity and stillness you can reach is unreal.

However you shouldn't just quit the devils lettuce. You should adopt new good habits like:

\- Meditation (big one)

\- Breathwork

\- Gym, eating clean

\- Quit porn

\- Read/Listen to books/audiobooks

\- Learn about Lucid dreaming (Dreams can tell you a lot about yourself. It usually takes a lot of decoding, but there can be a lot of questions answered, and fears removed via dreaming)

Type any of the above mentioned followed by ""benefits"" to see if any of the benefits resonate with you, then start your research. all of them above have done wonders for me!

Hope everyone's hanging in there!

I have ""quit"" smoking weed several times in the past. Every time without fault my withdrawal symptoms for the first 7-10 days include not being able to fall asleep until 3 or 4 am, getting terrible night sweats, and general brain fog and irritability. It essentially makes me either useless, or a zombie trying to function. In the past I was a student so it wouldn't impact me much during the year and so I'd just deal with the symptoms for the week and it wasn't really an issue. But now I'm working a full time job and have tons of work to do, so I can't afford to be awake until 4am every day and sleeping 4 hours when I have to do big brain work for 10 hours, which means if I want to quit smoking I'll have to take time off work to do so, otherwise I'll probably cave between the stress of work and not being able to sleep. Which is no problem, I have vacation days to use and could use a few days off anyways. 

However, before/when I was in school I lived by myself and so it was way easier to will myself to quit because I would just get rid of all my weed stuff and not go to the dispensary (easy in the winter when it's -20 and I don't want to leave the house anyways lol). But since the pandemic started I've been living with my boyfriend, who is also a huge stoner, so are his dad and brother, they always smoke joints together and hang out so I don't really think he's planning on stopping any time soon. While I think I'd be strong enough to not smoke after a couple weeks of being off, it has felt literally impossible to quit when it's in the house and being smoked all the time. I feel like I can't succeed because even though the first day is easy enough to get through, I always fail within a couple days because it's so accessible. Not having it in the house is really the only reason I could quit before because I have no willpower, and even then my alcohol intake would increase.

So with that all said, I'm wondering if anyone has ever done a ""detox trip"" to quit weed? I obviously need to get away from my bf/the house full of pot in order to have a chance, but I don't want to just go to my parents' house because I know I'll be an irritable betch and that wouldn't be good for anyone. I have vacation days to use so I was thinking about taking a trip and just laying on a beach and detoxing and not worrying about when I sleep/wake up, then at least when I'm going through the worst part I'm doing so on a relaxing trip lol. The beach part isn't even necessary just what I had in my mind, but I figured I'd reach out to see if anyone has done this before and if there are any good suggestions for a good place to go while detoxing. 

If anyone has had a similar experience and has any tips/suggestions or general comments to share, I'd love to hear them.",2

I've been a daily smoker for 20 months, and it was helpful for some time but not anymore. For everyone here who has decided to slow down or quit, kudos to you!

The most challenging day was day three and day four for me. Now, I'm getting used to the routine, and I feel more productive! I want to read more because I was never able to when I was high, but honestly, some nights, I just want to play video games and scroll through TikTok.

I am having so much trouble sleeping....I wake up 3-4 times throughout the night, my dreams are intense and scary, and it's hard to feel fully rested and rejuvenated. HOWEVER, waking up hasn't been crazy hard. I get out of bed faster, and after some coffee, I'm feeling okay. I'm finally showing some consistency for my new job, too.

I take melatonin most nights, and omg random, but I must stop taking Unisom (Doxylamine) because some studies show it makes you prone to dementia or something like that. 

Any tips for better sleep? When does sleeping get better and normal again?",1

Grief and coffee problems.,"Daily smoker for two years after 15 years frequent alcohol and drug abuse. I (33F) lost somebody very close to me to an OD this year and felt totally unable to face reality. 

I have had this morning cycle ruling my life for so long. In the morning when I first woke up I would feel disgusting. The taste of old smoke in the back of my throat; I would resolve never to smoke again. Then I would get up, make coffee, probably forget breakfast, and be buzzing hard in the sunshine—all ideal provocations to smoke, relax, get going with ideas. 

This cycle just went on and on, and my high self and my not high self were just not communicating at all. It was just shifting from unhappiness to numb guilt and back again. 

Anyway I love coffee and am now realizing that if I drink one cup instead of three I don’t have to bring myself down again, and that I was subconsciously over-caffeinating to give myself a reason to tap out from having feelings that day. 

Grief makes you want to choose stupid rituals over yourself, every single day, until you’re barely there in your own life anymore.

Yesterday and today been absolutely furious with the world, and when the anger burns out then it moves to some pretty brutal depression. A few years ago my life fell apart (my own doing) lost pretty much everyone who cared about me (I was lucky enough to have a big group of close mates) and been on my own since then. I've been taking the steps to build myself back up, the latest of which is quitting smoking weed and today has just felt like I'm back step 1 with it all. 

I couldn't figure it out at first, I blew up over some bullshit that happened at work (that was proper bullshit) and took a few days off cause I thought it was just burnout but it didn't really help. The penny just dropped and I think it's the lack of that sweet smokey distraction I'd usually use to deal with the stress of life.

Just wondering how long this bit has lasted for everyone else? In need of a light at the end of the tunnel.

Usually a life long lurker cuzza anxiety and that, joined this sub a few weeks ago and it's served as the best reality check / inspiration to just kick this life draining habit once and for all.

I stopped for a few months right before COVID but when lockdown hit I started getting high constantly to numb the mental stress.

I’m 24 and have depression, I’ve been struggling with it for a few years, starting around the same time I started smoking consistently. Eventually weed started to become a crutch for the tough things in life, and I had this feeling in my gut that if I want to finish school and change my situation for the better I needed to stop. And reflecting on today I realized that even though I’m still working through my mental health I can see that things have changed. 

Today I rode my bike to the gym in the morning, laundry in the afternoon, and cooked dinner for my roommate and I in the evening. I was really stressed because I knew I was going to be cooking tonight and it usually feels like a chore, I also had to make a couple dozen cards because I gave my word I would. I wanted to smoke to just change my mood and I was close to doing it today but ultimately held out until the urge passed. 

I realize that without weed you kind of just have to face things; a bad mood, making dinner, your finances, your life. Quitting isn’t what’s leading me to ultimate peace, because I’ve still had some stints of bad days this passed month, but it’s definitely done me good to stop. I’ve really been enjoying having a regular sleep schedule and dreaming again. I’ve enjoyed not being foggy brained, and not getting the munchies at night. I like to write poetry and it’s helped me with some of my really negative feelings, but 2 years ago when I started smoking very frequently I felt my creative juices dry up. But now I’m writing again :) 

Even though I keep hearing that little voice that says ‘it’s been long enough you’ve earned it!’, I’m really glad I’ve held out. I like many of you was subbed here for a couple years before seriously trying to stop, now that I’m on this roll though I hope I never go back. So yea, I’m about to fall asleep and it feels poetic that I had such a good day the eve of one month without even realizing it. I wish you all luck leaves 🙏🏽",8

The last few days I went on a trip to the city where I lived the last 18 years of my life to see friends, celebrate a birthday and generally just have fun. And that's what I did! Since I was never a social smoker constantly being with people made it so that I didn't even get cravings.

I told my best friend a couple of weeks ago how much I was smoking and that I was thinking of stopping. That was a big step for me - as nobody except my husband knew the extent of the problem. So I updated her on how my journey was going. 

I also told another close friend about my weed-habit and that I'm kicking it and she - to my surprise -said that her new boyfriend is on the same journey (2 months in). No judgement, no ""OMGs"" just matter of fact responses and encouragement to see it through. Telling people that are close to me was a big step for me and adds a certain accountability to the whole thing.

While I was away I didn't sleep too well (was waking up multiple times a night) but that always happens when I'm not sleeping in my own bed, so I don't think it was withdrawal related. Since there where some parties happening I had quite a bit of alcohol, but the fun kind. Not the ""I'll drink to cover up my cravings"" kind. AND!!! I found a non-alcoholic IPA that I loved! Nice and bitter, just like I like my beer. Just have to find out if they deliver to my region.

What I found my brain thinking about was not so much the present (I'd like to smoke now!) but the near-future. Like if my brain was trying to put a timeline together for when I would be able to smoke again. Thoughts like ""You're doing so good and it's surprisingly easy - you could totally buy a baggie and just smoke occasionally!"" are becoming much more constant. And of course I like those thoughts: ""promise of reward? curling up and smoke while watching my favorite series? yes please!""

Then I think that I'm not even 2 weeks in and that I have been on vacation (weed-free) longer than that. Also, I set myself the goal to at least not smoke until June, so try to keep in mind that I already gave myself permission to smoke again and if I buy now, I'm bending to the will of addiction and not achieving my goal.

Coming home from the trip was a real test for me: After so many days of heavy social interaction I feel drained and need some recharging time. Before, that recharging was very much anchored to cozying up and smoking. So not having that when coming home was interesting. But it wasn't that weird/difficult/... either. I won't lie though, I totally would have smoked if I had anything at home.

I think one of the things why I'm eager to give myself permission to smoke again is that I don't really see a difference? I'm still not a morning person and wake up tired and take a long time to get going. (My mum is the same way and she has never smoked in her life) I'm not ""more focused"" neither has ""the brain fog lifted"". To be honest, I never understood what people meant with that and supposed that I'll find out when quitting. Well, I haven't. I'm basically the same, but not smoking in the evening. (Which makes a good point to keep not smoking: if you are the same, why put it in your body?) 

If anything, last week I had a harder time concentrating at work. Like normally I'd be like ""Go, be productive! Because later you'll smoke and you'll do nothing."" Now the feeling is like: Well, since you'll not smoke in the evening you can be productive the whole day, so let's procrastinate some more. I feel like I'm wasting MUCH more time now. It seems I can't stay on task and loose interest quickly and start to jump from one thing to the next. It feels like I lost the structure my days had if that makes sense. I'm feeling like I'm half-assing things which is not my normal approach to work at all! 

Then again, that were the first days of quitting, so maybe this week will be different? Since I was on a trip I didn't get into the work flow yet, so I'll see what happens over the next days. I'll see if that feeling of non-focus and procrastination sticks around. I really don't like that.

As always, thanks for listening.",3

That saturday, i had the house all by myself, this hadn´t happen in years, so i thought it would be the chance to smoke, i felt fear and temptation at the same time. One day before, the idea of relapsing was pretty marked and really near of becoming a reality. It did not happen.

I distracted myself from it by taking a walk, did the house chores, took a nap, watched a movie, played some games and exercised. I seriously thought i was going to be tough to beat the temptation but it wasn´t at all. Im fully aware that cravings will be present, no matter the time or moment, however, this kind of situations could help me detect the emotion of wanting to get high and learn how to respond to it in order to dominate it properly. One thing i know, i need to keep busy in order not to think on that shitty drug. Believe me, Lazyness + Weed addiction = Perdition.

I have to thank this community for the insight, opinions, support and company, we are brothers and sisters helping each other become better individuals and progress step by step, day by day.

Finally, i leave you with this quote:  Health is about accepting, perceiving and dealing with reality on reality’s terms.

2022-02-09 20:59:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/soudwf/day_14_its_worth_it/,Day 14. It’s worth it.,"Hey all, just wanted to uplift those in here.

I’ve smoked for the past 5 years of my life and have struggled to quit. Many of us in here have experienced the fun that comes with MJ, but all of a sudden, bombarded with the subconscious thoughts of needing to quit. After ignoring that for years, I became depressed and was always outwardly looking for fixes in my life, blindly ignoring the internal fix that was needed (weed). 

I became so attached to the MJ, making excuses and justifying why I needed it. “Rewarding” myself after very little effort in tasks with a fat blunt. 

We all have gone through the stages of, “I’m more creative when I’m high,” “I’m more productive when I’m high.” Just straight up ignoring what’s best for us. 

Even gone through times of masking my problems with a blunt, running away from feeling my emotions (terrible thing to do btw.) 

I’ve always strived to see growth within myself and weed was my limiting factor. Making me lazy, unmotivated, sluggish, foggy. 

How I’m dealing with it: 

I had to really dig deep within myself and question. 
• Is this my potential? 
• Is this the best version of myself? 
• Why do I feel the same everyday? 

The simple truth in it is, if you lack the want to change in all aspects of your life, you’ll just go back to the same things you already do. Every area of your life, you should be thinking big. You should not be anything LESS than your best self. For me, my best self isn’t a slave to external desires to mask my problems. It’s a disgrace to the people who actually believe in me. 

The time to think BIG and be BIG is now. Don’t put it off, don’t make excuses. Your life doesn’t change, YOU do. If you sit and wait for the perfect time, it’ll always pass you. 

But, after all, this is all an opinionated post from a 24 year old. Take it with full confidence or don’t take it at all. 

Peace and love.",72

That said:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After 2 weeks of removing my stash, I feel miserable

&#x200B;

I joined a local weed sobriety group, and it seemed great. And after some reflection, what I loved about weed was that it was the only thing strong enough to shut out everyone else and just focus on me, in the moment. 

&#x200B;

That effect was also why I hated weed. I got addicted. I didn't want that feeling to end. 

&#x200B;

I love to exercise. I enjoy meditation. That said, I HATE when people hear my problems and recommend those things. I don't want something I could do for an hour just to have it end, and I go back to a day full of that stress and those expectations.   


The difference with weed was the chemicals. Once I took a hit, it was an immediate relief, and once it starts, I couldn't end the high. Better yet, no one else could stop me being high. I made that decision, and no one could change it once it was made. 

&#x200B;

But when I exercise or meditate? people contact me right before, during, or right after those breaks. They feel like lunch breaks in a stressful job. It's time carved out for me, but I can see the waterfall upstream.  

&#x200B;

""But confronting those feelings will motivate you to improve your life to get rid of it""

I know, but god damn it, it's so hard. and maybe I won't be strong enough to overcome it all. 

&#x200B;

Weed's effect was not at all perfect, and it wasn't free. I'd go back to reality with brain fog, exhaustion from staying up late, bloated after overeating.  I could only smoke when I was home, so while I was disconnecting, my SO would join the rest of the world in being cut off, except she was in the same room. Being that way seemed sad

Since stopping anxiety doesn’t seem as bad, not as focussed on it. Feeling much better in myself and more comfortable with my sober self. Once you push through the first few days it gets so much better.

Have also met a girl and things going really well - definitely put this down to quitting weed.

I don’t know if this is just the late effect of cutting a long term “smoking career”, but I expected all of this to come sooner, not when I was nearing a full month of being weed-free. It feels like I’ve had a stack of paperwork growing on my mental desk all these years and now that I’m stepping out of the fog I’m noticing how much work it really is. It’s not just cutting the weed out, I have to actually replace all that time I spent with doing something productive or fulfilling.

I got into a horrible car accident a week ago. It is so bad that I was emergency lifted to one of the 5 hospitals in the country that would be able to reconstruct my face. I am so thankful that I happen to live 3 hours from this hospital.

Obviously, I haven’t smoked since my accident and I am feeling better about my future. I have been wanting to quit and have tried stopping for a day at the most but I always couldn’t get past detoxing.

One thing I want to mention to some of yall is to not be surprised if you feel yourself getting random phantoms highs. THC is stored in fat cells, and if you were big on munchies like I was, you may notice random phantom highs occur due to your body metabolizing fat cells and releasing small amounts of THC.

Learning to be human again.,"This is my first time posting, I’ve been lurking a few months, but haven’t had the courage to get personal. Now, I think it could help me, so here I go. 

I tried smoking for the first time when I was 14. I’m now 30. My older sister did it a lot with her friends and I always thought it was something that was cool. I might have tried it because of that, but by the time I was 17/18 I was smoking everyday with my best friend. We both had a lot of personal issues that we supported each other through (including his mother getting really sick with cancer). For me, I always struggled with my own personality. I was always described as “overdramatic” by everyone that knew me. To them, it was a quirky feature of my personality, but for me this was a daily struggle of me trying to suppress my emotions and not be “too much” or “too dramatic” of a person. From such a young age I struggled with my mental health and not knowing how to channel my emotions or feelings, and weed provided an easy way for me to get out of my own head and also be “calmer”, a more socially acceptable personality type. I channeled my “dramatic personality” through being involved in creative arts, but it wasn’t enough. I always felt so deeply passionate about everything, even silly things, that I felt weed helped calm me. At a young age, I accepted that this would be my coping mechanism. 

There were some periods over the years that I smoked less, perhaps times that I couldn’t access it, or was too busy to abuse it. That all changed when I lived alone for the first time at 19/20 years old. I stopped caring about my studies, and generally got really overwhelmed with life. I got into a bad relationship, and then fled the country (no joke). That escape helped me, but not for long. 

So, after I moved across the world, of course I found myself back in my old habits, as soon as I found a way to get it. Sometimes I went through phases of smoking less, but ended up in an abusive relationship for 4 years that I felt trapped it. He made me feel like I was the problem, he was hardly ever home, so I smoked alone at home any chance I could get. That was the beginning of my worst downward spiral. It took me 4 friggin years to understand (through all the thick smoke) that if I wanted to be happy I had to get out. So, I did. But, I continued to abuse weed maybe more than before, and I got into drinking. Not many days went by that I didn’t spend in my apartment alone drinking a bottle (maybe 2 of wine) and smoking my stupid bong after becoming single again. I was proud of myself for leaving the relationship, but told myself it was ok to abuse smoking, and that I had earned it in a way. It was my therapy. 

You know what my biggest roadblock was? I was really good and even excelling at my (high stress) job. I told myself it was because of weed. It helped calm my brain so I could deal with the stress. I was never high at work, but the amount I smoked when I got home was not human. 

Well, I guess I was always looking for that thing that would make me stop. Maybe my partner would give me an ultimatum (something inside me though knew my relationship was bad, and hoped weed would be the reason it would end, because I didn’t feel I had the strength to do it on my own.) Maybe my job would require it, maybe some really bad health problem. But nothing like that happened, and I just coasted. 

5 years ago I met the man who is now my husband. He is the most amazing person, and I feel lucky. With that said, he’s not overbearing, and never would push me too hard, although of course it always bothered him. Because he accepted my smoking habits (and drinking)… things got worse. I lost my job (which I convinced myself was because I wanted to leave), I got us both arrested for buying weed (even though it was me who did it), and I even lost a pregnancy. I can’t explain to you how devastated I was that the man I love was arrested because of something I did. And the pregnancy was the last straw. I did quit when I found out I was pregnant, which was probably too late. I know pregnancies can be lost for many reasons, but I do blame my abuse to my body in a big way. 

After that loss, of course I went straight back as fast as I could. Buried myself in my bong for a few months. 

Now, we are starting to try again. So, I made myself take a break ahead of actually being pregnant. To prepare my body. But also prepare my mind. 

I don’t have some grand happy ending (yet) but I’m on day 5. I did that. Without anything forcing me too other than my own volition. I am beginning to see the world a bit clearer. My skin is clearing up. My diet is healthier. My routine is healthier. I feel human again. The truth is the last 10 years were a struggle for me, because I created that reality. There are big chunks of time I barely remember. There were times when I literally lost my grip on reality. And by the way, through these 10 years, other than my partners, no one else, not even my closest friends knew how much I smoked. Honestly, my partners didn’t even really know the extent. The amount of garbage I put in my lungs, and the amount money in the garbage, with no real will to stop. It was always more important to have the immediate gratification than think about the bigger picture. I always thought my emotions were just too intense to deal without it. 

It’s only been 5 days. But I’m learning to deal with my emotions in a healthy way. The other day, something really annoying happened. Normally I’d get out the bong, and maybe buy a bottle of wine. This time I went for a run. I came back feeling better. That really amazed me. I don’t remember the last time I had that from something healthy, even though it’s so simple. 

The point is, if you are like me, it may seem like the only way to cope. I’m learning that I’m a lot stronger than I have given myself credit for in the past. 

This is just a small part of what I have gone through, how smoking has effected me, and how I am overcoming my addiction. If you read it all, thank you, it was a long one! 

I don’t have any professional advice, only want to thank this forum for being my friend through this lonely process. I’m literally learning how to be human again. 

Much love to you all, and wish me luck.",6

I'm 37 and have been smoking daily since 16, with a few breaks here and there. I managed to quit for a year, several years ago, but other quitting attempts only lasted a few months or weeks at most. I'm a weak person when it comes to sobriety. I've also pulled my wife into my lifestyle and she has been smoking daily with me the past 8 years with some breaks thrown in. She's stronger than me for sure.

I have managed to be a high functioning pot head however. I have a stable career in I.T. and have been in the field 9 years. I exercise (lift and cardio) often and eat healthy for the most part. However, since quitting on January 9th, I have experienced all sorts of withdrawal symptoms.

For the first week, I would have hot and cold sweats when attempting to sleep, and I just didn't sleep well. Loss of appetite sometimes. I probably ate one less meal per day than needed. The loss of appetite has faded, but I do still experience issues sleeping. I wake up in the middle of the night several times usually, and sometimes cannot fall back to sleep for an hour or two. I also really wanted to smoke again that first week, but after a month, that is no longer the case. I know I'm going to quit long term this time.

My biggest issues now are feeling fatigued constantly throughout the day, and worse, I just feel cloudy headed ALL day long. I am dedicated to studying for my career with reading books, reading website information, watching course videos, and practicing stuff like coding. However, I find that I cannot concentrate on these things for more than a few minutes without getting distracted. I get these sudden urges to just ""do something else for a few minutes"" which oftentimes turns into an hour or more of wasting time. It makes me feel incredibly unproductive. Almost everyday I feel like I didn't do enough.

Please, for those of you who have been smoking all day, everyday for 20 years, does this cloudy head and fatigue feeling pass? I really thought at the one month point I would be back to ""normal"" (whatever that is), but I just do not feel right. Again, I exercise and eat healthy and drink tons of water everyday, so that isn't the problem. Maybe my brain was just really 'damaged' from how long and often I smoked? Would love to hear some of your positive thoughts. The unproductive feeling is really turning into depression, and I don't have time for that. :(

Cheers to all of you! Thanks for reading.",10

I was reading a book on helping to quit weed which led me to this lovely reddit page.

I am a 24 yo(F) and never really smoked week until the pandemic hit and was really introduced to it. I have some chronic health issues and found that smoking improved a lot of the symptoms, but now looking back on it, it numbed me from everything not just my symptoms. As the pandemic went on I began to use weed more and more. I simply did not care, I would waste all my money on weed when I should be saving, I would get high driving, during work, and even before I nanny. I was at the stage where I didn't even want to smoke because I knew it was making me feel worse but did it anyways.

It made me feel shame as when I look at the clock craving weed at it only being 8 AM, I also felt shame because I would hide my early morning smoking from my family (I live at home with my parents and sister). I decided I need to make a change so I have been cutting it drastically the past few days and yesterday was my first full day where I didn't smoke all day! I didn't realize how bad it was until I started feeling the withdrawal symptoms, feeling nauseous, poor appetite, brain fog, fatigue, ect.

I'm sober for 1 month now after 20 years of using pretty much every waking hour.

I'm here to tell you that it does get better and the first 2 weeks are the hardest. Most of the withdrawal symptoms are now gone, I can sleep, no more nightsweats, eating like an animal and the best of all, no more feeling tired all the time and brain fog, my brain is faster than ever. 

I still have some paranoia and anxiety, but that's is something that I have to deal with as I am neurotic and a overthinker. Did try therapy but it's not for me, at least for now (I'm pretty sure my therapist was a stoner himself).

Hang in there guys, and good luck on this quest against our toxic green friend.

What I’ve found is: No, they’re not having more fun than us! We got together to play Cards against humanity, everyone was doing shots, bong rips, etc. I was drinking tea all night (I’ve cut off everything along with weed, even coffee). 

At the start of the evening I admit they were laughing and making silly jokes, but as an hour or so passed, none of them was having nearly as much fun as me. They got tired, ordered food and overate, then they got sleepy and started drinking energy drinks, leading them to eventually crash as early as half past midnight. 

I was looking at their faces all night - they were all in their heads, no one was truly “loose” which is the effect we all expect from drugs and alcohol. 

I haven’t been sober for this long since I was 14. I’ve also never been happier. 

I’ve spent the past month doing some intense shadow work and meditation and facing all of the suffering I’ve spent 13 years avoiding. 

Now I have nothing to escape, no need to sedate or stimulate my mind. Nothing is more satisfying than my own self.

I’ve found myself becoming more and more dependent on the herb, particularly in the evenings and weekends. Basically anytime I’m home and don’t have anything “important” to do. 
I’m 29 coming up on 30 pretty quickly, have a 5 month old baby and have been an everyday smoker for the last 6 years. 
The first few days the urges to smoke were definitely there however I struggle the most come bedtime. 
Terrible insomnia all up to this point but I’m happy to report the urge to smoke has definitely subsided.
One weird symptom I’ve definitely noticed was some strange recurrent dreams, which is odd for me as I don’t really recall my dreams too often. The dream in question involves attempting to board a plane through a conveyer belt but the door being locked and getting stuck which is a nightmare for me as I’m claustrophobic. 
Either way thought I’d share my experience thus far as I feel this would be a good outlet for me.

History: First smoked at 16, started smoking daily at 17, started with half a gram a night and quickly went up to a gram a night with binge peroids of smoking all day, every day. In total I smoked daily for nearly 6 years. 

Why I quit: I was unmotivated, anxious, depressed and experiencing severe derealization/depersonalization which made my life a living hell, felt like I was stuck in a permanent ac1d trip and a joint away from turning schizophrenic. 

How the quitting process went: A particularly bad high on January 4th is what put the nail in the coffin and made me realize I couldn't keep smoking. The first week was really hard, insomnia, night sweats, brain fog and anger outbursts. I wouldn't crave weed at all during the day but at night it got really hard because I wanted to sleep so bad. I kept remimding myself why I was doing it and it kept me from smoking. After the first week there was still some insomnia and night sweats but the anger outbursts became less frequent and after week 2 they were pretty much gone. Sometime during week 2 the insomnia and night sweats went away as well. 

How it's benifeted me: The difference is night and day, sleeping better, having dreams again, anxiety is down 70%, depression basically gone and the derealization/depersonalization/paranoia is completely gone. I feel sharper, my thoughts feel clearer and I no longer feel like a slave to weed. I'm also over 3 weeks off cigarettes and can attribute that to quitting weed (was smoking spliffs). 

Tl;dr: Life is better, I didn't ruin my brain, all I needed to do was quit smoking and I'm really grateful I did. 

Hope this post can motivate some of the lurkers to take the plunge and quit and some of the people in the early phases to keep going, it's really amazing how much better life is without weed.",4

I have friends who can go weeks without smoking and spontaneously say “I think I’m gonna stop into the dispensary and pick up a joint, take the edge off” and my jaw drops, probably salivating as well (lol). Like anything I guess, I can have a few beers on the weekends and not think about them during weekdays.  

I think living in Canada, where it has become very popular is just kinda a smack in the face, maybe That’s a little self cantered. I guess I’m just rambling at this point.

Keep up the great work guys!",6

It’s not to say it wasn’t hard and I still think about smoking frequently.. almost every day. Also, I have noticed other addictions creeping up. But I am happy weed is going away for good. Each week, I see small improvements in my attitude and joyful experience of life. 

As a business owner I used weed to escape, early on I thought the weed helped me be more creative but that was the furthest thing from the truth. Now, I’m relieved that I convinced my mind to stop and stuck to it. 

Things are taking off. I can’t even imagine doing my work high or getting high after. We are onboarding 3 new clients and don’t think I could ever have done so before. We convince ourselves it helps but really there’s a reason it’s nickname is the devil’s lettuce. The business was not progressing and I was the only reason.

I (M26) normally don't like to make posts about my personal life but this is something I wanted to have written down to look back at. Today I woke up and my GF (F24) had left a note on the living room table saying, ""I'm quitting today. Packed up all the weed shit and put it in a a box in the garage."" I was so proud of her for making this leap. We've both been talking about how smoking a bowl every day was doing us no more favors. I wanted to get over the habit but couldn't provide any real plan or goal in mind. I wasn't ready yet. She's getting on new medication and was going quit eventually. It just came sort of abruptly.

At first I cried because this substance was a big part of how I coped with my job and my life. It was great for my anxiety and stress but took away a part of myself that cares for anything and everything. When I'm not high I felt bland or bored no matter what I was doing. I acknowledged my apathy but didn't confront it at all. 

Without this push from my GF I would have kept coasting along in life without changing myself for the better. I've read what years of weed can do to your lungs and brain. Smoking nearly everyday for two years is not the worst but I know it will add up and the real struggle can start when I get older and my body starts breaking down starting with the weakest parts. I don't want those future health problems. I don't want to escape life or try to find safety in a substance. That does me no real favors. 

My GF wants to get off of it so she can focus on her degree and her job. I didn't want to be the only one not taking this seriously. I knew my problem was just as bad as hers. If she wants to get better I want to help her. I didn't feel like I could do that while still being a habitual smoker. 

Please wish us luck. This isn't the first time either of us have kicked the habit completely but we both know that we can never go back to how things used to be. I already tried getting off again months ago and my body did not like it. I think withdrawls will be a very real thing I have to deal with. I need as much advice as possible that'll help us both. We plan on donating all our weed and pipes to a friend. We hope having no substances in the house will keep the urge down. 

We want to be a part of this community and make the most of our lives.",11

I quit as part of a devotional yoga program I do every year at this time. Clean eating, clean thinking, careful actions, hours of daily meditation and yoga.  Oh, and that little drug-free clause they slipped in there.

To be honest, for me cannabis hasn't ever resulted in the negative effects that other drug addictions have.  This makes it harder to keep the motivation to stay away from it.  But I promised.  And my spiritual mentor says that even if I can't feel it yet, an increased sensitivity is growing in me due to cannabis being absent.

In fact, he’s been semi-retired because I put so much work in and really don’t expect much in return. (What can I say? I’m a millennial.)

Recently, I had a big ask and not only did he not deliver as he said he would, but when I tried to talk to him he just ignored me. I’m talking humming-to-himself-as-I-talk ignore me. My boss is gruff and a bit of an asshole, but he’s never straight-up disrespected me as he did today.

On my way home I couldn’t stop crying. I’ve literally put my blood, sweat, and tears into that place and I feel like it means nothing now because I’m asking him to do something hard. I’ve always considered him a rational and kind person deep down, but the way he treated me today feels like a betrayal.

I can’t even make a first small step towards quitting, or perhaps I don’t even know where to start. 

I have ADHD, been diagnosed recently so I have so much to learn about it related to weed addiction. I just thought I was thinking/operating differently, but I always knew I was smoking joints in order to calm down my head or to stay focus on tasks. My psychiatrist said it’s been auto medication for 10 years. I’ve been wanting to quit for 8 years. 

I succeeded once and I quit for 1.5 years. It helped that every time I would smoke a joint, my heart was racing and I was feeling like I was gonna die. I think that was my body telling me to quit. 

As I understand it and speaking from experience, ADHD people need pressure to start working on something. I don’t want that pressure to be my deteriorating health. I know I want to quit, I know weed brings me more bad than good.

But how do I find the willpower? What first steps do I take?

Nearly all of my symptoms of withdrawal are gone. I have one that lingers and it's erectile dysfunction.

 I gained 10 healthy lbs of muscle. Follow a strict diet and have improved my relationships ten fold. I feel like a different person today and it's only a month in. Addiction is truly a disease I don't wish upon anyone.

The symptoms I hated most was initial brain fog and night sweats but other than that everything else was pretty doable and breezed over quick with my diet and light working out. I haven't had a single craving since week 1 and I'm appreciative for that. I would read countless horror stories about this and to this day I can confirm weed now turns me off a lot!

If you are struggling with quitting be honest with friend and family and draw your inspiration from others. It's never going to get easier and the longer you hold off it will only get that much harder. Also just because you are sober doesn't mean you should force your perspective on other friends just set the example for them to base their decision off.

I started smoking over 10 yrs ago when I was 18 and within a couple years I was hooked. I've always managed to quit, but I've always relapsed: smoking every evening sometimes up to the point I had to write everything on a post-it until noon at work, spending entire weekends smoking first thing in the ""morning"" binge eating so much I'll have reflux for the rest of my life, desocializing, not doing anything else than smoking, eating, wanking, and going to bare minimum class, and the occasional getting shitfaced while high.

Somehow over the years I've managed to keep my high paying high functioning job and my consumption never impacted it so badly (although I'd probably be way up the ladder without weed). It's probably what kept me out of the worst but since it's such a demanding job, it also drains me and that pushes me back to weed whan shit gets tough.

Weed makes me depressed, ruins my proper eating and execising habits, makes me flee the social contract I desperately need, turns me into a disgusting vegetable yet there are times when I want to get back to it, to alleviate the pain of boredom and loneliness. I however have my loving parents, brother and sister, some friends who are mostly good people and I can't figure out why I keep being so lonely. Homeworking has been tough, turns out seeing boring people every day is still better than seeing none....

But the worst part is, and it hits me every time, where did my hobbies go ? I used to be such a curious and passionate child and now the only thing I can do is unplug my brain in front of Netflix as a replacement for THC. I can't think of a thing that I'd enjoy doing. There are some things, but they seem so pointless that I can't gather the motivation to get to do them.

Has any of you been able to get past this at some point ?

Living at home with parents (although due to buy my first flat end of the month!!) so am essentially faced with locking myself in my bedroom for a minimum of 6 days.

2022-02-08 12:33:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/snpsug/hospitalised_but_want_to_relapse/,Hospitalised but want to relapse,"I have made many attempts to leave, some more serious than others with my longest time abstaining being over 6months - at which point I wrongly convinced myself I can smoke in moderation because I was ""over it"". 

Just before Christmas me and a few friends got an ounce each for a ""Merry Spliffmas"" - this was all well and good until the festive season was over and I had to return to work and normal life. I ended up in a&e from what I think may have been a panic attack 4 days after stopping smoking. I had blood pressure so high that the docs hadn't seen it for someone my age (25), heart palpitations and other weird symptoms like loss of balance. It was pretty scary and at the time I thought I was having a stroke and was a bit worried I was gonna die 😅
Aanyway I decided to keep up not smoking as it couldn't get any worse right?

Well in many ways I think that is true, however I'm now roughly a month after stopping and am feeling depressed and anxious alot of the time and get intense cravings when feeling this way. To make matters worse I can't exercise (something that usually really helps me and many others) at the moment as I recently fractured my tibia and cannot walk for the next 2 weeks at least.

I've been having cold showers, trying to drink more water, have meditated a few times (but not consistently enough) - all things that I know work for me - is there anything else I can be doing to try and help with the cravings? Bearing in mind that I'm trapped in the house.

I'm a believer that the sky is blue behind these clouds and know it will pass but I'm also finding it very difficult to resist at the moment!

Typing this has helped to clear my thoughts. I guess I'm just gonna have to be stoic and get through it but gonna still post as reading other people's experiences has helped me many times.

I'll leave this with a couple of quotes that have resonated with me:

""A limit of time is fixed for you, which if you do not use for clearing away the clouds from your mind, it will go and you will go, and it will never return."" 

""..no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.""

My singing voice is 300% better since quitting weed!,"Hey wonderful community of friends! Wanted to share an unexpected benefit of quitting weed that I am SO loving...

So I am a 40-year-old guy. I smoked pretty regularly from the time I was 22 or so. I didn't smoke throughout my day, but almost ALWAYS did smoke pot at night. I smoked cigarettes rarely when I drank on the weekends but never bought packs or anything (I was that asshole social smoker guy at the bar who always bummed cigarettes off ya). :) 

So yes. I've been sober (from weed AND alcohol and cigs) for 2 months and 4 days now and though I didn't expect this, my singing voice is DRAMTIALLY better. I grew up singing and was in bands in college and in my 20s. Like many singers, I did it but HATED the way my voice sounded. I even took voice lessons but practicing was always hard because I just HATED how my voice sounded.

Anyway, since quitting I actually like how I sound for the first time in my life and I think there are two reasons:

1. Obviously, not inhaling hot FIRE and smoke into your throat is gonna make you sound better. As any doctor or voice teacher will tell you, smoking dries out your throat and is not good. Yes. I know. A LOT of famous singers smoked....this still doesn't make it HEALTHY for your voice.
2. This is probably the MORE dramatic reason...like many of you, weed made me anxious and I think my weed-fueled anxious brain made me even MORE anxious/insecure about HOW my voice sounded. Now, without this added chemical layer of insecurity removed (in addition to the provable medical improvements not smoking offers), I actually LIKE how my voice sounds.

As a result, I'm playing so much more guitar and learning songs than I ever did in all parts of my life. It's just fun...I'm just doing it and don't have to ""prompt"" myself to practice (and then feel guilty when I don't). It's coming from the INSIDE now.

Anyway, just wanted to share this because I never thought about this benefit before and for ANY of you that are singers, this may be an ADDED reason to quit or to STAY on your sober journey.

Love and respect to ALL of you!",20

I’m also feeling a lack of joy in my life at the moment. I read on a thread recently that joy is a “slow burn” compared to excitement/thrill/novelty. Joy is something that is cultivated over time, and when I think of cultivating something I feel tired. Like it’s going to take energy and effort, and when I’m sad it feels like so much more effort is needed. I know deeply that it’s not true but I let the sad feeling give me permission to retreat and avoid.

Here are some things I'd like to say about my path to recovering from an addictive lifestyle:

(Edit: oh my God I'm sorry about the formatting I'm on my phone)

Early life things that led me to using:
1. I believe I was born an addict. I have early childhood memories of willingly electrocuting myself by sticking my fingers in electrical sockets because I liked how this felt. I did this maybe 2 or 3 times to get the high. I also have a lifetime of being addicted to computer and videogames, as well as having the TV on all the time.
2. My family has a lot of different addiction issues. Mom's side has a diverse amount of addiction issues between alcohol, drugs, and food. My dad's side is a bunch of financially stable ""functioning"" alcoholics. Both my parents used to smoke, now they are both addicted to food. They're very old and their overeating has been causing them severe health issues for decades. It's very hard to see them crash diet and binge eat on a regular basis. One of my siblings is severely addicted to social media to the point where they literally cannot listen to conversations IRL. My other sibling struggles with over eating and I noticed that their drinking has gone up ever since they've had kids.
3.  I was raised in a hoarder house that was active in a small conservative religious group that has a lot of qualities in common with cults. We intentionally separated ourselves from people who we thought were sinful, so I grew up in a home that was judgemental/resentful of most of ""the world"".
4. I have a lifetime of insomnia, depression, and ADHD that made things more difficult for me than other people who didn't have those conditions. I was always getting into trouble, didn't care about academics, didn't feel like I fit in, and I felt like I was inherently bad.

My use of marijuana/cannabis:
1. I started experimenting with drugs and alcohol as a teenager. Smoking weed clicked with me the most. Not a lot of research was done on it, so I was convinced it was ""the healthy"" drug.
2. I smoked/vaped weed for 11 years. I was high all day, every day. I enjoyed the high more than anything. I had a social circle for the first time in my life. I thought it cured my insomnia, I thought it made me more creative. It made school and work more bearable. It made it easier to ignore how uncomfortable I was living in a hoarder house.
3. I was lying and manipulating everyone around me so I could get high more often. I constantly switched between ""I'm going to moderate"" and ""I need to quit"" as I had experiences that led me to understand that weed is addictive, and harmful to my health. Every time I would take a tolerance break, my relapse would get worse. My anxiety from relapsing was worse every time. I've had a seizure from smoking too much. I mentally depended on weed to feel functional. 

How I Quit:
1. I went to a number of therapists for addiction. Finally, after a few years, one pointed me to an addiction center.
2. The addiction center put me into an IOP (Intensive Outpatient) program. I get drug tested once a week. I go to 2 hours of group therapy 3x/week. I get 1 on 1 therapy once a week. This has helped me more than anything else.
3. My therapist got me to start attending AA meetings. I'm secular, so this was challenging for me. AA meetings aren't that bad at all. I found one that we do yoga at, so that was cool. It's very useful to physically be around other people who are overcoming drug addictions. I have more in common with them than I realize. I'm starting to get active in online Marijuana Anonymous meetings, and I'm even chairing one this month. I finally got a sponsor in MA and I'm working on Step 1.
4. I'm doing a ton of CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and this has helped me deal with negative emotions I'm facing as I quit. Here is what I personally do: every morning, I wake up, brush teeth, meditate for 10 minutes, write down 10 positive affirmations, and do 15-30 minutes of yoga. Before bed, I do 10-30 minutes of yoga, I write down 10 things in grateful for, 10 accomplishments I did today, and then I read with relaxing music, then I listen to sleep hypnosis as I go to sleep. It's a lot to do but it's helped me feel better than I ever have before in my life.
5. The books I read before bed are usually self help and focused on addiction. They're great and help me understand more intrinsic things about addiction. 
6. Checking in on this subreddit is good. I think it's important for me to remember that there are tons of people with addiction issues just like me, and there are tons of people who can overcome it.

A timeline of feelings of sobriety after quitting:
- Week 1: oh my God this sucks I have CRIPPLING anxiety.
- Week 2: nothing is enjoyable but I'm hanging in there.
- Week 4: okay I'm doing fine but life is kinda blah, will I seriously feel like this forever? I am so busy with all the self care and group therapy.
- Month 2: I'm okay, my CBT routine is keeping my head on straight, but do I REALLY have to work this hard to feel normal?
- Month 3: I'm doing pretty good, but I want passion in my life. Glad my ADHD is getting under control, I can focus longer lately.
- Month 4: life is great and all, but my whole entire life is revolving around recovery. I want a hobby!
- Month 5: I am so happy to help out others on their quest to recovery. I'm slowly building a community around me. I want to get involved in the sober gym and more yoga. Excited and nervous to start 12 steps with my sponsor.

Things I still struggle with:
1. I still have occasional ""relapse dreams"" and they suck.
2. I am so moody around my parents and I need to learn to control my aggressive tendencies toward them, especially my mom. 
3. I have to be careful of emotional eating and escaping to video games. I feel the same addictive tendencies that I did toward weed.
4. I am impatient and want to have more balance in my life and be further along than I actually am. I need to focus on living in the present tense.
5. Sometimes I am stubborn and I choose to not go to sleep because I'd rather stay up and do anything else but sleep. I pay for it emotionally and physically the next day.
6. I judge others for drinking and smoking regularly and that's not my business.

Things I don't (usually) struggle with anymore:
1. My self care routine makes it so easy to sleep now.
2. I am generally less emotionally reactive and less spiteful.
3. I don't binge eat (as often).
4. My ADHD and depression got WAY easier to manage. 
5. I quit using most social media because of the negative impact it had on my mental health.
6. While I still don't have a ""clique"" or ""crew"" or ""group of friends"" in general, it is much easier to have sincere connections with people around me.
7. I can solve and understand problems that I have without ignoring them or blaming life circumstances on them.
8. I'm sure there are other things but I forget them right now.

Anyways I think that's all I have to say. Please let me know if you have any questions.",34

Waking up every hour Coated in sweat and falling back again into another world.

One dream (that I woke up and laughed about) - Dwight Schrute came to my house with a big bin liner full of bud to try to sell to me, right as my dad was pulling into the drive (who HATES weed). Ended up grabbing this bin bag of weed and running down the street with it. And then rolled a massive joint behind my house 😂

The woke up in a panic cos it felt so fuckin real. Sweet relief when I realised I didn’t smoke.

I'm on Day 8 and I feel pretty good.   I had trouble sleeping for the first 3 days, but I'm sleeping better now.  I have had a slight headache for a few days, but that's getting better as well.   

I'm wondering if the TCH stockpile in my system is so high that my body is riding off of that and nasty withdrawal symptoms will come later on.  After all, I smoked daily for 20 years, with only occasional breaks (due to work travel).

I want to be well prepared for the next few weeks, or months if necessary.   For those of you who are farther along than me, did you have delayed withdrawal symptoms?   I would appreciate any advice from the group.

Thank you!",12

This is embarrassing but now that it's been so long even if I did smoke, the first smoke I have will be too intense I bet. I'm schizoaffective and the psychoactive nature of THC often messes with me quite hard, especially when it's been awhile since I've smoked. So I just gotta remind myself that's not normal...I shouldn't be using it period if it makes me feel that way even once.

Anyway, here's to day ten and I hope I make it a bit further

But I had that exact same thought process the last time so I guess I knew not to get my hopes up for some kind of life changing transition in which all of my problems will magically fix themselves. I am responsible for the change I want to see in myself. 

I quit because I wanted to, for my family and my new job and especially my health. The thought of being late into my life and still being exactly where I was a month ago was terrifying. Quitting was something I've been trying to do for 4 of the 6 years and I feared I was going to live the rest of my days as an addict whose life was in control of The Green Menace. How many of you can say you're in control of your life when a day hasn't gone by that you've not thought about the smoke, the feeling, the craving.  The agonizing guilt and anxiety it brings when you know you are in absolutely no position to smoke right now and it's most certainly the wrong decision in that moment but you do it anyway, you sell yourself, because rolling over and giving into the crave is a hell of a lot easier than fighting. 

Just remember we are fighters, that's why we're here. Everyone here has taken that first step towards sobriety and each of us recognizes a bit of themselves in every story, every day not smoking and every relapse. The support you give is that of which you wish one day someone can give to you but were all one so go and be the change you want to see in others",20

Take off your blindfold.,"Hi fellow redditors! I am a 23(F) and am pleased to announce that I am 1 month sober from weed with support from this sub. I was a smoker for 5 years, which slowly krept up from one joint in the evening to 3 blunts a day. I would argue till the end of time that weed made me happier and it didn’t harm me in any way. ‘You guys drink wine every evening, so what’s the problem with me smoking weed?!’. I argued it made me more creative, calmer, active, a better person. I held down good jobs, stayed active and healthy, led a normal life. So what was the problem? 

Weed became my ability to escape and accept. 

Hate your job? Smoke a blunt. 
Unhappy in your relationship? Smoke a blunt. 
Feeling lonely? Smoke a blunt. 
Hate yourself? Smoke a blunt. 

Weed was the warm comforting hug that allowed me to accept my current state with no question. Weed was the blindfold that stopped me from seeing my life for what is really was. But all those emotions you are trying to escape, they don’t really go away. Before I knew it, my normal comforting retreat was accompanied by all the pent up anxiety and resentment that was pushed down inside me every time I inhaled. 

With the help of therapy and leaving an abusive relationship, I realised that life is meant to be lived and experienced for everything it is. Good and bad. Lots of days are a battle, but every day completed is a reminder: I am powerful. I am capable. I am strong. I can face my life head on. The hollow hug that weed gives you is nothing like the strength and comfort you can find within yourself. 

For the first time in what feels like forever, the world is a little brighter. Take off your blindfold &amp; see.

Edit : Thank you so much for everyone’s wonderful comments ❤️ wishing everyone lots of luck and love for their journeys 🤟🏼❤️",502

I hope everyone is well 🙏🏻

I was a chronic daily user of weed for over 15 years (started at the age of 15) with a few 6 month breaks in between. I had never experienced any severe withdrawal symptoms from those half year breaks, just the typical ones (insomnia, irritability, low mood, etc) however, I'm now 1month and 10 days clean from the substance, and it's been the worst period of my life to date.

In the past I've had 2 tumours removed, my gallbladder removed, suffered with pancreatitis, yet none of those come close to what I'm currently experiencing.

I had decided to give up weed and tobacco (still vape nicotine) after being diagnosed with pleurisy, and having experienced a severe panic attack after vaping a miniscule amount of weed after the diagnosis. 

The first week wasn't so bad, I was able to eat and sleep just fine, but the hell started for me in week 2.

I would constantly experience heart palpations, high blood pressure, dizzyness, blurred vision, muscles that would cramp, brain fog, diarrhea, vomiting, basically every withdraw symptom you could think of. 

My GERD also seemed to become active after abstaining from weed (never had any issues prior to me quitting) and would result in me being unable to swallow for a few hours. 

I developed quite a severe health anxiety, as I didn't know if the chest pains were related to Gerd, pleurisy, increased blood pressure or simply by me quitting weed cold turkey. 

I've made numerous visits to A and E (ER) had multiple ECGs, bloods, and one heart ultrasound. I'm also waiting to have a 24 hour ecg fitted, as one of the ECGs showed a slight arrhythmia. As a result of my anxiety regarding my heart, I decided to purchase an oximeter.. Which in hindsight was probably another mistake on my behalf, as I find myself somewhat obsessing over my heart now (I feel as though I've become hypersensitive to my heartbeat) which at times have shown my heart rate to fluctuate from 62-130bpm.

All of my other tests have come back as normal, bar that one ecg which showed an arrhythmia and the Dr's put it down to anxiety.. The thing is that at times I'll wake up and feel my heart racing, I'll go to check it and it's at 135-140bpm at rest as I've just literally just woken up and haven't even had a chance to conjure any negative thoughts. Having said that, I don't know if my anxiety is somewhat subconscious, as I'm not actively engaging with those thoughts, but my body will just react and display panic/anxiety symptoms. 

I hear that exercise can help with the symptoms however, my last walk resulted in me nearly fainting from a panic attack after getting heart palpations. I've also experienced anxiety the other day whilst I was on a train (cold sweats, feeling agitated) even though I love trains, and have never experienced any anxiety/panic before I quit weed. 

Apologies for the long post, I just want to talk to others who have gone through the same as many people downplay/are ignorant of the issues weed can cause. 

Thank you 🙏🏻",6

I've smoked weed for a while and at first it was for the social aspect but overtime I have used to regulate my depression and stress. 

However, there has been multiple times which I've quit, I think the longest I made it was 3/4 months but whenever something major happens in my life I have a tenancy to overthink stuff and get caught up in the past or think too far ahead in the future to where I need a smoke just to stop the negative train of thought.

Currently in my life I've just graduated uni however due to me smoking I doubt that I can go into my chosen career as weed does limit my thought process however as stated without it I get caught up in a deep depression.

Has anyone here had a similar experience and if so what advice would you give to not give into the stress and continue without smoking? Thank you",2

I have a lot of mental health issues - I have no job, no job experience,  no education, no money, no friends or connections. My sleep schedule is completely screwed up because of insomnia and i've often been up late smoking weed because everyone at my home would be asleep. I'm heavily depressed and anxious. haven't gone outside pretty much for 8 months, and i'm finding out i have symptoms of ADD, Bipolar, Psychosis, Schizophrenia and probably more.

Everytime i have smoked lately it feels like it now might be the time that i lose my mind completely and something happens. I **don't** hallucinate or have delusions like that, but i'm just pissed off everyday, waking up depressed and suicidal everyday and i can't function in any sort of social setting. Smoking weed and listening to music keeps me sane it feels like. I haven't got a haircut in a long time so i look completely insane. i  have intense dysmorphia so i'm afraid to be seen by people.

I've been really losing it lately, and i don't see how anything is going to change. My mind has been racing constantly with thoughts for a long time and i feel mentally worn out. Recently i have been getting frustrated more, smashing things in my room or completely raging on my parents. For years i was quiet about all this shit - but now i'm starting to go crazy from it and i have noone to talk to so all kinds of insane thoughts just echoes in my brain always.

So I’ve been having pretty bad GI issues and have realized I probably have some degree of chs and should stop smoking and havent for the past 3 days. The problem is I’m really struggling, not with withdrawal or any symptoms, but just full on depressed and hopeless. I have pretty bad ptsd intertwined with an eating disorder and GI issues separate from the CHS and weed feels like one of the few things that has helped with any of it..

I relate to being lazier and extremely dependent on it and some other common negatives, but that doesn’t really matter to me when the alternative feels so much worse. I have tried different meds and EMDR but nothing has really helped me except weed. I know I need to stop because its making me sick, but having to think about food again and going out sober and being triggered in public all sounds so terrifying.

I’m only 23 and thinking I have to spend the rest of my life without smoking sounds so awful and hopeless I don’t know what to do. And knowing I’d rather be sick then sober feels awful and embarrassing too. Especially seeing so many people with CHS act like people are just dumb for craving or smoking again. I can’t work out to distract myself, I can’t just eat better to make my stomach feel better, or really any of the things that has helped people quit. No doctors have really helped or made progress on the multiple chronic issues I have, so it’s really hard to have any hope of ever feeling better with any of it now.",8

I was stripped to an absolute shell of a person and I couldn’t imagine getting through this life, this world, without drugs. 20 months ago I stopped using drugs and alcohol but continued to use cannabis. I let myself believe that cannabis was harmless. I was lying to myself. I was dependent on the way it made me space out from the world around me. It gave me that familiar rush and high that I was so fond of - not the same as my previous drugs of choice but similar enough to keep stringing me along. I shared this in another recovery sub r/redditorsinrecovery and someone told me “try being really clean for once” and fuck that offended me. I had 20 months without SO much, but they were right. Their words have haunted me. So I stopped. I haven’t used any cannabis products in two weeks at least (didnt count the days because I suck at that oops). I never thought I would be free from the grip of cannabis. I’ve accepted that I’m not someone who can casually use drugs - even ones that are largely considered “harmless” and that’s OKAY. But I’m choosing myself and my sobriety and FUCK I’m so proud of myself. I’m so happy. It feel so good to have made this decision for myself because it’s one of love and commitment. I’m getting rid of all of the edibles I have stashed throughout my house so I don’t get tempted in a moment of weakness. I just wanted to share this here because I never thought that I could do it but I already am. There is so much hope, life, and joy in sobriety. Sobriety is the reason why I’m alive and writing this today. I bow humbly before sobriety because I know that without it I would be stripped down to nothing.",19

It is day 2 without cannabis. Last night I slept only about 4 hours, but the natural sleep felt so damn good.

I haven't been able to eat much today, but I accomplished so much, so effortlessly, it makes me very excited for my life without weed ahead of me.

I've been fighting some sort of flu bug for a couple days, normally I would smoke to ""feel better"" when sick, but being high while sick always ended up making me feel worse. I feel very good today as compared to Saturday (my last day smoking).

My coughing sounds healthier, too. I quit vaping about a week ago in exchange for Zyns. It's amazing how much effect inhaling chemicals has on your overall health.

I'm excited to sleep tonight, and I can't wait for tomorrow.

I love you guys! Stay strong!",4

I’m at a transition in my life where I quit my job and am trying to figure out my next step. Weed became an insane handicap in that process. 

A week later and I feel like my mental sharpness is returning already.

I also remember that one of the first times I ever smoked, way back in high school, I felt a wave of depression the next day. A friend of mine said the same happened to her. I think it really is a real thing that it causes that for some people at least.

I’m definitely a depressed and anxious individual, and using weed did not help at all. It masked the problems. When I was ready to address those problems I felt like they were just the same problems dug down 20 ft deeper because of the amount of time i let go by without addressing.

I’d actually rather feel fully the feeling of being depressed and anxious so that I can decide I want it to stop and figure out how to help it go away, 

My sleep has been the biggest improvement since stopping. It’s become important to me again and feels so healing. 

I hope this helps someone else trying to do the same.",60

2022-02-07 18:52:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sn50dw/pure_anxiety/,Pure anxiety.,"Hello all! Long time lurker, first time poster. A bit of background, I'm 26 and have been smoking on and off for almost 11 years, completely on for almost 4 years. Always high, always. I could easily smoke an ounce a week. 

As of lately, I'm recognizing that weed really doesn't help my mental health at all. Of course, In the early days it's fun, relaxing, bliss. But, I'm seeing that it is now making me anxious, I've had panic attacks from it that caused me to go the ER because I was sure I was having a heart attack. I used to laugh at people who said weed made them anxious. But for a reason I wake every morning and have to smoke because I'm too anxious without it... It really makes no sense. When I'm sober, I want to be high, when I'm high I want to be sober. 

2 days ago I didn't smoke during the day and wow, that was ROUGH. Panic, anxiety, trembling, body temp all over, socks and shoes wet from sweat, palms so sweaty I swear they could drip. Anxiety convincing me that these feeling can't be from weed and that I'm actually crazy, my internal dialogue telling me that I must be schizophrenic, must be bipolar, must have a brain tumor ect. That night I smoked and all the physical stuff vanished immediately and the anxiety calmed down.  Yesterday and today I have taken a tiny hit from a pen when I feel the symptoms arising, it helps a lot. 

I'm not too sure my reason for posting, maybe some advice from people who understand? Either way, if you made it this far, congratulations! I am known to be a little long winded lol.

Edit. I should mention that I am an alcoholic. I Haven't drank in almost a year. (Very proud of myself, that's a really rough one). I drank and smoked morning to night for a while. Gave up drinking because it was blatantly destroying my life, now I'm thinking it's starting to be the same with the reefer.",10

I smoked for nearly a decade and towards the end was smoking an ounce a week. From waking up till going to bed I would smoke bowls, hitters and bong rips. Sometimes I would buy a 1g pen and it would be gone in a day. I was becoming anxious, depressed and hating my dependency on something that wasn’t really doing anything for me anymore. Last year after a horrible panic attack I decided to quit cold turkey.

It truly does get easier! You forget what it felt like to be high, and your body readjusts.

Changes I’ve noticed to help you be motivated:

-Activity’s bring you joy again. Yes that’s right, wether it’s video games or nature walks, the boredom you felt doing it sober, and fatigue you felt doing it blazed is gone.

-Having a working memory and being able to actually read a book and enjoy/retain it is great.

-You eventually start sparking new interests and pursue new hobbies instead of just getting high. For me it was Yoga (highly recommend it) and D&D.

-Food tastes good again and I can remember my dreams. Sleeping actually feels restful and comes easier.

-The mental clarity, moments of peace, full range of emotions both joyful and sorrow, it’s something worth attaining. 

I remember the first few months THC free sucked, but I promise it gets better! Get out of that haze and find passion and Serotonin again!",42

Lately, I feel weed has taken control of my life. it had of course done the same in the past but I feel I was not aware back then idk or maybe didn't care n would ""handle it later on"" I have a stable job, meditate daily and go to school but I NEED to pack a bowl EVERYDAY before I leave the house I get this overwhelming urge and I just always give into it I'm starting to hate my lack of self-control over it since I struggle with social anxiety adhd etc etc not to mention my brain is still developing I just feel so dumb in public anytime I'm high especially in social scenarios it just amplifies my anxiety 10 fold or at school, it obviously is not beneficial at all for me, oh and if I forget to meditate before I smoke in the morning I won't for that day so it also gets in the way of that.

a gaping hole in my bank account slowly leaking cash and a cloud of extra anxiety seems to be the only 2 things weed is offering me now I have aspirations in life that I don't think weed will be beneficial  for etc I've thought about quitting before and have for that 2 year period (not on purpose, of course, i was actually trying to smoke still and gave my self a few panic attacks just to maybe get high again) so i sort of know what it feels like, it was like i felt so much purer i was only drinking water getting into weight lifting etc then i slowly started smoking again( i would literally inhale the smoke of the end of a joint not puff on it) and that's how it all started again pretty soon i was taking tiny bong hits and the rest is history  

so I guess I'm just looking for support brothers ik it's gonna be hard since I've been doing it for so long and it's just become a part of my daily routine and ik my friends are all gonna be like ""whaaaaa bruaaaa nooooo not again"" not to mention my dad's side of the family loves weed and my dad smokes every day so he might not like it either but I think now is the time to put it down it just doesn't feel like it adds anything to my life anymore im just so addicted and used to it that I think I need it I just have so much ahead of me and if I don't stop now whos know if I ever will.",2

Be brave as it challenges you to exercise both your heart and your mind as you create your own path towards sobriety. Don't waste valuable time with addiction and regret. Spin wildly into your next action. Enjoy the present, each moment, as it comes, because you'll never get another one quite like it.

I wasted my life with weed but it was the chaos that the booze created that made me get help. 

I’ve been here before, knew I was smoking too much at 19...10 years later and I’m still in the same position. Living with my parents, never had a serious relationship, minimum wage job. 

I’ve realised I wanna fucking live. Not just exist. I was gonna quit at 19, then 22, then another mental breakdown then I’ll quit next Monday or I’ll quit after Christmas. That day never came. Just fucking fed up of it. Marijuana anonymous has helped me get through these first few days. It has been so nice to talk to others in this position.

So grateful for r/leaves. First found this years ago and it planted the seed.

I don’t know what happened, but I was a total zombie or slept through all day Saturday. Didn’t meet any of my goals, didn’t do anything fun, didn’t even get quality rest. That day is just gone. And now it feels like today I’m scrambling to catch up. And the anxiety hits again. And the anger, too.

Today I decided marijuana is no longer worth it. I am worthy of a fully lived life. Soberly in control.

My story:

*I'm 29 years old.  Been smoking since I've been 17.  I used to be a cigarette smoker, a pack a day between the ages of 18 and 21.  I know I have an addictive personality.  I grew up under an alcoholic and always had the mentality saying ""everyone has their own vices"" or ""at least i'm not addicted to alcohol or other drugs"".  I've been an avid gym goer for 6 years and I'm very into health.  This would be my main motivation to leave.  However, It is difficult to think of when I absolutely love going to the gym high. I love playing soccer high, I love doing a lot of things high. Also, for the past 3 years I've been growing my own weed. It's all outdoor, grown in the California sun.  I've turned weed into a hobby itself.  Growing has seriously been a source of meditation for me.  So I grow a few pounds, sell it, smoke it, make some very minor profit from it, but enough to say I'm smoking for free.*

*I guess the main reason I'd quit is to support a healthier lifestyle and to lean off being dependent on weed to 'take the edge off' of the dreadful task of being disciplined.*

*Can anyone else relate to this?  Seriously feel like a needle in a hay stack.*

I'm a functioning addict - I could smoke & carry on with my day; go to work, sort out activities, a mum & daughter event every Saturday (I have a 4yo, single parent, so one-to-one time is super important) - but being ""functioning"" just hides how severe the problem was... or is. 


The clarity will hit & I'll just be drowning in guilt. All the times I hurried through the bedtime story. All the times I wished I didn't have to play bc I wanted to smoke. Just having my little girl around the damn stuff! The GUILT. 


I've got therapy on Thursday but was hoping anybody had some hints/tips to help me through the guilt phase of quitting. I've quit before so I know I've got about 4-5 days before the clarity hits, I just want to be prepared.

Nothing in my attitude towards weed has changed from the moment I tried quitting for the first time unsuccessfully until now. And I would like to share this with all of you.
I knew back then that weed was ruining my life and I know it now too. However, back then I didn't realize that the initial withdrawal cannot be overcome no matter your mindset. Even if you have all the desire in the world to quit, you will still experience some physiological changes if you have abused it.
It took me 6 months to realize that when the withdrawal kicks in, it doesn't mean that it will last forever and the only way to fix how you feel is to go back to smoking.
Now, I realize that if one day I am gonna make it, then I still have to go through withdrawal. There is no perfect time to quit, the perfect time is when you have realized you need to do it.
Now I feel very strong and I believe I won't relapse for at least as long as I need to feel a normal sober person and be free of that addiction.

I've been through this before a few times  but feel like I have the urge and capacity to quit the most right now and the 2 times I smoked at night only the other day were not necessarily positive experiences, more just a checkup to see if I still like it.  Getting back on the wagon and have been for a week now but my wife wants me to attend substance abuse couseling. If you are not smoking and keeping it up for 3 months, what should I expect to achieve. I don't do other drugs and learned to dislike drinking through my MJ years but will have 1 - 2 beers/drinks in social environments. For this reason I feel very resistant to the idea of spending money on SA counseling.  I also took an extra step the other day to surrender my medical MJ card to further reduce access as that has been a main enabler of that habit in the past.  Looking for any opinions good or bad that the sub may have on this subject.  I'm really conflicted and thinking the meeting with a counselor would go along the lines of.....




Them: so why are you here




Me: Because I used to smoke weed




Them: are you having cravings now or smoking now






Me: no





Them: so why are you here and what do you want to accomplish from this






Me: make my wife think this is more effective than me just saying I want to quit and continuing down progressive path to sobriety. 







Overall, I don't think it is a switch that just flips off.  My former cigg addict friend told me he fell off many times before finally quitting and the main thing is keep your head strong and jump right back on. This I feel is the path I am on and can't understand what a physchologist can provide if I am already in this direction.",1

At the prime age of 48 and been a smoker since the age of 17, It is fair to say my entire existence has orientated around getting stoned, there was a period of time when I became a daddy that it did stop for 7 years pre my girls birth, I was very happy and was growing up.

So all that ended, and the laws in my country for unmarried dads are ancient, in short I have zero say in my childrens lives, I've never seen a report card from school nor been to a nativity play, working away didn't help but still she used and played the laws to their full extent, to the point where multiple breakdowns followed for me resulting in losing the house and my job and any purpose that I had.

Yup you guessed it, back on the weed and it's been Groundhog day ever since, my daughters are now 15 and 16, so that will give you an idea of this turmoil I have been in and at times still am. There were other situations that have contributed to this shall we say self destruction, from bad advice from accountants and bankrupted as a result, Vasectomised at 30 due to my ex partners request, I thought well ok I'm happy and now have 2 gorgeous girls and a step son from her first marriage, so I said ok....I would never recommend any man does this unless you are absolutely sure in your partner, the psychological implications for me have been heavy going, I have met other partners  in all the years, but the inability to have children left one feeling hung out to dry, it became a contribution to the feeling of worthlessness added to zero purpose of existence of being here, walking about the remainder of my days like a gelded horse, to the point now I just don't bother with even trying for a relationship now, besides I would rather go fishing lol, there is less emotional response required in fishing, haha unless of course you lose the fish of a lifetime...that can be very emotional and usually full of expeitiffs lol....jokes aside, the emotions have taken a battering over the years and fishing helps them rest.

To summarise things, I am surrounded by triggers in my town, I still see her parents and sisters, I even see her and her new husband in the big jeeps as they still work in this town, in all the years I have tried to quit smoking, it is apparent now a re location is in order, but I have an elderly mother here and she needs me so I can't.

My daughters know where I am and always will in the hope one day I will hear from them............I still send cards and stuff for xmas and birthdays, it's all my function is now a days, an eternal waiting game, but that waiting is easier down by the waters with the fly rod, nature is a wonderful way to heal.

Told you this was a waffle lol.

I shall finish off by saying, finding this reddit page has been enlightening, I have read so many familiar and resonative posts, some of which made me feel not so alone anymore, I thank all of you for that and the creators of this page.

So, for me and my journey, I feel now rather than fight the weed and make it a torturess affair, I am accepting the fact it's in my life and will attempt to take better control of it, I am a functional stoner, just like a functioning alcoholic, it does not matter the substance, addiction is all the same, mine is weed.

I pray for the day I win the lottery, of which I shall fly fish my way round the globe and the weed will only be a small part of it if at all, but whilst I am here in this town I kinda feel this is how it is just now.

Regardless of where I end up, I shall always write to my daughters, what I seem to have omitted here is the fact I've only see my girls for about 3 days in the 16 years since I left their mom, it seems pride and own agenda came before the kids and the relationship with their dad, a golden gal with a very high opinion of herself.  
Anyway, waffle over, I'm away to make coffee, skin up and think about trying to get the lawn mower and the strimmer started ready for the spring.

A lot of the times when I try to recall something that I should remember based on its significance in my life, many times those long term memories feel like I’m trying to remember a dream that I can’t quite recall fully. I don’t know what is more frustrating/daunting to me right now about my new quit attempt, the life issues I must deal with that have been festering during my latest binge(finding a new job, dealing with financial ruin, getting back to a healthy lifestyle and improving my relationships) or the sheer worry mixed with regret I feel from having possibly permanently damaged my main way of navigating the world(my brain) and so now I may not have the ability to deal with these things successfully..Whereas I’m sure I would’ve been confident enough in my memory to get me through this level of difficult circumstances in the past, in my brain that was there prior to my weed addiction. To put it more simply, I’m worried that I’ve smoked myself into a mind state that is too impaired to successfully deal with my life. I understand that may be the THC paranoia still in my fat cells talking but it is troubling how just plain “dumb” I feel right now. Like I used to actually be pretty articulate and have a great memory, and that loss of that part of myself seems just as aggravating as the financial and relationship losses that my weed addiction has caused.

Repeat. Everyday. For almost 5 years straight. Had moments of scraping every bowl in the house for the tiniest bit of resin before legalization. One day, I just got kind of fed up with being high all the time.

Less than a month after I stopped? Productivity through the roof. Released a few albums as a musician. Started studying Japanese. 

2 years after I stopped? Studied so much Japanese I literally moved to Japan. 

Since then, I make about $40k more per year, am in great shape and have a laser-like focus for accomplishment. 

I've smoked a couple of times since then, but it served more as a goofy reminder of how poorly I was previously managing my time. 

Do I miss it? The only thing I miss is getting high, getting cozy and playing video games. I've since replaced that with making dank chili, getting cozy and playing video games and it's twice as good because the same night, I can switch gears and still stay focused for my my other life hustles.

Do I villainize it? Absolutely not. Everyone is on their own path and everyone handles things different. But if you want out. Do it. Nothing but good things are awaiting you on the other side.

Edit: One other thing. When I first quit, I realized that my memory was somewhat fucked and this gave me a good deal of anxiety. This *will* get better with time. You may even feel like it won't at times and that maybe it just doesn't matter. It will. Promise.",209

i have a love hate relationship with weed as of right now. used to love it, now i just use it as a tool that feels like it’s doing more bad than good. I primarily use it to eat, and to keep me away from a drug that this sub wont let me say, but i can say that it’s the leading cause of death for overdoses in america right now. i’m a fiend for that shit and i hate myself for it.

Weed used to help keep me away from that shit, but now it makes me paranoid no matter how much i smoke and idk if i was prone to any mental disease like this but ever since i started smoking consistently i hear voices and nothing feels like a coincidence anymore if you get what i mean. i know its time to stop but im scared, because i know when i do i’ll end up doing the “other drugs” again. shit sucks man.",3

Started at age 15 and I'll be turning 33 later this year. 
Finishing up day 36 of being totally sober from weed (still having drinks on the weekends mind you). 

I've done clean weeks in the past, but usually never more than like 10 days; So this is the longest I've been weed-sober since I began probably 18 years ago. 

The first week is the hardest, but as time passes you think about it less and less. My best practice was just keeping busy. I have hobbies and just worked at focusing on those. I also use the app Sober Time which helps visualize the progress.

The pros overwhelmingly outweigh the cons, but I honestly can't think of any downsides to cutting it out:
The hacking/coughing is gone. 
My short term memory is back. 
My confidence in social interactions has dramatically increased. 
DREAMS ARE AMAZING.
Overeating/muching is gone AND I've actually lost weight over the last 36 days - which has snowballed and now I'm motivated to hit the gym again.

I do read posts on here from time to time and to those who complain about the first few days being hard (not trying to downplay or trivialize your struggle): be strong and just face the storm. Your brain creates patterns and you have the power to break those patterns and live the life you want to live, if you want it bad enough. If I can do this after virtually smoking weed everyday for 18 years, so can you.

I agonized over throwing away my shiny new grinder and my fancy vaporizer. I was paralyzed with indecision for hours. I hovered my stash in a bag over the garbage. I was terrified of letting go, but I was more terrified of not letting go.

It took a few sober, nonjudgmental friends. It took a good therapist. But it took at its core the aching, terrible horror that I had wasted my twenties chasing highs, oscillating between unreal contentment and anxiety. 

One year later, I know it was not a waste. I did not waste ten years because I learned how I could not live the rest of my life. A hundred years— that’s what the luckiest of us get. 

I used weed as a blanket. It protected me from the fallout of being sexually assaulted in the military at 18 years old. For nearly ten years I thought it made me friendly. I thought it helped me sleep. I thought it made me spiritual, creative. It didn’t. It doesn’t.

I’m sharper. I can remember more. I’m present in conversations. I can plan and those dreams I thought died never did, they only atrophied, and they started growing back again. Some days I miss smoking and I hate everyone and everything. I can be irritable, sad, resentful, insecure, but most days, I am better able to handle the lows than I ever was as a daily smoker. I am the happiest I have been in my adult life. Quitting didn’t solve all my problems but it sure as shit solved a lot of them. 

I threw that stash bag away and I thought I would regret it and that I would miss it. I do miss it. But I have never once regretted it. 

If you need this: I’ve been where you are, and it’s going to be okay.

Thank you, r/leaves.

Hopefully it is at least cohesive and relatively easy to follow if you choose to read it.

I smoked weed daily from 15 to 26, with minimal breaks, and I quit this past November. I stopped using mainly because weed was affecting my ability and desire to connect with people, and it was becoming a serious issue as I began dating for the first time ever last year. I also felt like I was becoming an emotionally-stunted adult in general, and there were other issues such as concerns about memory retention and my overall growing displeasure at relying on such an involving drug to eat, sleep, and feel normal. 

I've quit for a matter of weeks plenty of times in the past, but only a couple times for this long, and this is the first time I've made it this far with the continued desire to abstain, without a plan to begin smoking again. The typical physical effects of appetite loss and insomnia took about a week to disappear. The general sense of anxiety took about two months to return to manageable levels, and it still feels like it's decreasing slightly over time. The obsessive thinking and thought loops I found myself engaging and getting caught in came on harder, but disappeared more thoroughly after 6-8 weeks. I struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder as a child (less obsessive, more compulsive), but not anxiety, and I suspect that marijuana was masking these issues as an adult for some prolonged period of time. 

I was always perfectly content to spend my time alone, at home browsing the web or playing video games or watching YouTube videos, casually practicing piano or mandolin, cuddling with my cat, going for a walk in the park, listening to music, going thrift shopping... and that's pretty much everything I regularly did for a hobby in my free time. The problems were pretty obvious: I was content, but not happy, and I required a constant high to maintain this base level of contentment, and if I couldn't get high then I was very much the opposite of content; even though I was content on a day-to-day basis with being alone, I was beginning to crave a romantic connection with someone long-term, which I couldn't do with a sober person while smoking, and I knew I didn't want to date another stoner; nothing I did on a daily basis made me more interesting, or was particularly productive, or inducive of personal growth, and I could feel myself stagnating on every level. 

So far, quitting weed has ruined my enjoyment of nearly all of my hobbies. I still browse the web and watch YouTube videos for hours on end, but I don't enjoy it at all anymore, and yet I feel lost if I don't do it. I don't enjoy playing video games anymore, because it feels like some weird combination of too much effort and a total waste of time - I haven't put on my VR headset a single time since I quit smoking. I use music as a filler in the background instead of something that warrants critical listening, because I can't get lost in the music like I used to. I rarely go thrift shopping because I get bored by driving around from place to place - I can't just turn on some music and vibe on the highway like I did before. I haven't been able to replace these hobbies with activities I enjoy more, and quite frankly, I don't even know what I *do* enjoy anymore.

The obsessive thoughts that cropped up were by far the worst development of quitting. I quit a couple months after my ex and I (mutually) broke up, and after handling it appropriately during that time (i.e. not thinking about him at all after about two weeks), I suddenly began reaching out to him again, obsessing over hypothetical scenarios where circumstances and situations were different such that he and I could begin dating again, and funneling a great deal of my newfound emotional instability and obsessive, nervous energy into thinking about this single person. I had begun to keep a journal to document the quitting process that only became filled with entries about him. These obsessive thoughts slowly began to decrease in severity, and now they are largely gone, and no longer focused on my ex - I now occasionally find myself obsessing over personal events (past and upcoming) that cause me anxiety. What also helped to change the target of my (by then, dwindling) obsessive thoughts was the more general tactic of distraction - I started dating someone else, lol. Quitting weed has also seriously crippled my ability to enjoy being alone, and while I do not find myself obsessing over this new person, spending time with him is the only prolonged activity in which I'm currently able to find consistent enjoyment (which also plays into what I'm learning is a tendency to escalate new relationships too quickly, but that's a more complex issue that has nothing to do with weed). 

A large part of all of my post-weed struggles are likely connected to my current life circumstances. I've moved four times in the past 4.5 years (personal circumstances, then for school, then for work, then for school again), so I don't have any local friends and have not had any for a while (except for the two guys I've dated in that time, if that counts), and have not tried to make any because of the knowledge that I'm not anywhere permanently enough to bother - they'll just turn into internet friends, and I have enough of those (having only internet friends is yet another dynamic that was acceptable as a stoner, yet feels hollow after quitting). I'm also finishing the last semester of my engineering degree, which is a large part of why I chose to quit when I did - I figured that this is the last year that is specifically dedicated to self-improvement and growth and learning, and so it would be an appropriate time for me to finally learn how to be a (weed)-sober adult. It's the dead of winter in a cold and snowy region, so I don't enjoy being outside and I can't indulge in the single hobby I have left that I never stopped enjoying (which is riding my electric unicycle). I hate being a student in general - I like to learn, but I hate dedicating my life to it for these periods of time, and so I've never coped well with the demands, even though I end up doing fairly well in my courses. I feel a pervasive feeling of guilt when I'm a student and not doing something school-related, which contributes to my inability to enjoy my hobbies. I'm also keenly aware that it's almost time for me to uproot once again, begin a new career somewhere that has more tolerable weather (I can't handle the weather I grew up in any more), and create a new life from scratch for myself yet again, which makes me anxious every time I think about it. 

I'm not going to start smoking weed again over the concerns and struggles I've laid out in this post. Overall, I think I'm on the right path, I hope that it will continue to get easier, and I think that I will look back on this whole thing and feel that I was right: this last year of university was a good time to quit. Right now, though? It's really hard to dismiss the acknowledgement that my day-to-day would be much easier and more palatable if I were still a stoner. My academic performance never really suffered when I smoked, so that wouldn't change - what would change is that I would be able to find enjoyment in my lonely, boring dynamic again, in this last period of time before I'll truly have the power and personal circumstances to create something better for myself. Right now, I miss the efficacy of my herbal coping mechanism, and I hope I'll get through this and never feel again like its presence would improve my life. I'm open to any advice, on how to find ways to enjoy myself again right now, or regarding anything else in this post - otherwise, thanks for reading.",46

Did so, started abstaining from events that would take me near weed, went through all those crazy dreams / etc etc...

Then I found the pen on Friday, sitting in a pocket.

Since quitting, I had a narrative at the back of my head going ""no it was just *too much* weed, weed is fine in moderation, you can make it work, etc""... that voice won on Friday, and I did try moderation. Hit the pen three times over about three hours, while doing some other activities (exercise/cooking/movie night)... and it sucked. The first hour with exercise was a little more fun than normal, after that everything was just... meh... fuzzy, disconnected, harder to think/feel, and after the movie I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do. Ended up spending another hour on the couch watching TV. It also hurt my sleep quality, a solid 10hr and I was still dead tired the next morning.

But, now it's final. I tried going deep in the weeds and that wasn't fun. Moderation wasn't fun. Weed just isn't for me anymore. It's gone and done.

In total it’s been about 12 years of this now from 16-28.

I’m living with my parents right now cause I am trying to buy a place which is ready a year from now. If I didn’t have my parents there’s no way I could’ve been here but I feel this incredible guilt that they have to help/see their son like this. 

I’ve damaged a few friendships and I don’t know how I can reconcile. It’s like I created this distance between my best friend and I. Overtime it’s grown and I know they have outgrown me to some degree but they still try to keep me involved. Can’t help but feel like I’m tolerated not celebrated. And then the other friends who weren’t as close and tried to reconnect I just didn’t give them time of day or less them on with no intentions of meeting up. 

My girlfriend has been Out of country for a few months now but we have been going downhill for a while. I can’t help but feel like I got with her out complacency and now not sure if not being with her is the right idea because I don’t know if I really love her, or if I can even love her. It’s not fair to her, her life has had so many challenges and I selfishly made her fall in love with me. I can’t help but also feel like if she left, and the more sober I get I will regret it because she cares about me, truly. 

I know I’m a bit of a sociopath for sure, but when I’m high I’m ok with it and now I’m sober for even four days…. I can’t reconcile with myself 

I’ve never been able to, this guilt always takes over. Like my past has written the story of my present, and im cursed to repeat this cycle cause it’s all I’ve ever known since a teen.

I also have about 2.5 packs of cigs left that I’ve been smoking since 2005, and I’ll be giving those up when they’re gone (I’d guess about a week).

My reasons:

- It’s getting noticeably harder to breathe. When was the last time I took a 100% full breath? Is it even possible?
- Anxiety over the smell, especially around family.
- Dollars. 
- I’m getting dumber. Not only is the memory going, but articulation is struggling, and I just DON’T think. Like I made the decision long ago to do it as little as possible.
- I’ve never had any motivation. Ever. Nowadays I’ve written it off as not even worth trying to get it back. 
- I eat less, eat better, and exercise more without it.

Here are the following symptoms I have experienced:

* Anxiety / existential dread (mostly gone)
* Depression (slightly better)
* Anhedonia (still in full effect)
* Low motivation (still in full effect)
* Brain fog (slightly better)
* Memory issues (slightly better)
* Trouble sleeping (gone)
* Oversleeping (still in full effect - sleeping at least 10 hours per night and taking a 30-90min nap)

&#x200B;

Things are getting slightly better over time, but my motivation is still low and it's tough to stick to my schedule and work (I work in sales as an independent contractor and it's tough to motivate myself). I am trying to keep myself on a schedule, as I feel a lot better when I do. However, some days I just don't have the motivation.

It was difficult at first but after 3-6 months it became second nature. I settled into a groove and it was suddenly my new normal.

Now, looking back, what’s difficult is believing I was ever that far gone into this habit. It consumed me. It consumed my life, took precedence over everything, including my young family. Non-stop, all day, every day.

Quitting was hard. I tried and failed dozens of times, but I was persistent and eventually it stuck, and now I’m here and I am infinitely happier and more content than I ever was getting high 24/7.

I am finally in control. I am finally clear. I am finally free.

If you’re struggling or want to quit, throw yourself into it and work through the process. It takes time and dedication and it can hurt and be difficult but in the end sober is better. Hands down.

On weed I didn't have to worry about managing my feelings, I could just be high and be super stoked to do the dishes.

So now after hiding my true daily habit for.....10 years... I thought it'd be cake to just stop. Get pumped reading /leaves, throw all the shit away, I'll be fine in a week or so.

A month in my emotions are all over the place, happy, sad, hopeful, despondent, lazy, motivated, anything but stable. The worst is the anger. I am getting pissed way more easily, which in turn pisses me off further. Knowing that I shouldn't be angry doesn't help either, I'm still feeling intense fight or flight responses for stuff that didn't bother me nearly as much when I was high, wtf? Stuff like spilling a glass of water or my dog barking at something and I hit the ceiling with rage -  not who I want to be. This paradox makes me want to use again, to push all of my emotions down with THC so I can be the 'better' version of me. This glorifying of the ganja is what leads to relapses - day dreaming of taking 'just one hit' because everything will magically be better once I do that.....right. 

But I know myself, if I have one hit tommrow I'll have two and then I'll be back to a daily habit I was hiding from everyone - a cherade that would come crashing down some day and really hurt the people I love. Not to mention the damage to my lungs and brain and heart and wallet. 

So I'm taking it day by day. Doing meditation and exercising, holy balls exercising works miracles if you can get yourself to do it. But from all I'm reading my brain needs time to rebuild its connections. It's been depending on weed and its myrid of endocanninoids to function, without that influence it needs to re-sync a lot of shit in the synapses. Short circuits and inconsistent performance may occur. 

Thanks /leaves, reading the posts and writing random ones like this help greatly. I might need to try an MA meeting to really be honest with myself and process what I'm dealing with.

Decided to go looking for some support to keep going. 

I think it was good for me for a time, I never was a relaxed person, I hid from my anxiety and depression by just being go go go never stop and think type of person. 

I think weed helped me stop and be more Introspective. I actually started contemplating myself and my behaviors more. Started comparing myself to my ideals and how I could live up to them.  

But now I think it's become it's own kind of escape, it's the only way I can relax but I became to relaxed. I miss my motivated self and I miss being clear headed.  I miss pushing for my goals in life.

I've started meditating recently and I think it helps alot with quiting. My biggest concern is my girlfriend doesn't like it, she doesn't like that I get up at 8 on a Sunday and start cleaning the kids room, or clean my truck out. Or work in the yard.she doesn't smoke but the likes me being relaxing all the time.  
Does anyone have advice on how they relax after quiting smoking?

I'm hoping talking to people like you all will help me not sit down and have a toke on a Saturday night! And find some ideas for other ways to still relax!",3

So far I have: 
- Messes with my memory
- Makes me feel ashamed
- I spend way too much money on weed 
- Bad for the environment (too much packaging gets thrown away)
- Messes with my sleep (I can’t remember my dreams)
- It’s a waste of time—I spend hours smoking and staring at nothing
- It makes me feel lazy and unmotivated 
- It makes me feel tired
- I barely even get high anymore, my tolerance is so high
- It feels better in the long run to stay sober than it does to get high

I have ADHD, and I am prone to addiction. It is impossible to have a healthy relationship with MJ, in my current and foreseeable living situation. It also intervenes with my medication.
2. The high is great - until I overdo it, which happens every single time. I can't use in moderation, therefore I have to give it up all together. The feeling of being high becomes my normal state of being day two of smoking, after longer breaks.
3. It is hard and almost impossible for me to take a break from it. I need to quit, I have no self control when it comes to MJ. 
4. My short term memory is absolutely shot. I remember two days ago, I was sitting by my desk, and thought; ""I'm going to roll a spliff and head out"", when I realised that I had already rolled a spliff. wtfffff
5. I self isolate and don't tend to maintain my relationships when I'm getting high all day erryday. I am not able to be present - not in my life and not in others. My family is my no.1 priority, and I can't be present with them, because I always wanna run off and get high. 
6. I can't concentrate on my studies or anything else.
7.  MJ mellows me out and helps me enjoy things, it was a great crutch when I needed her. My life circumstances have changed drastically, and I want to give myself a shot at being present and content. Yes, we have had long breaks in the past, and still felt miserable, but I am not at that stage anymore. I don't need a crutch, its time to walk on my own. 

Today is my first day off this beautiful, yet terrifying plant. I chose to do this for myself, and for he people I love and respect. I want to live a life with integrity and MJ hinders that, by making me more impulsive and avoidant. Here's to a new chapter - being high is not even shifting my perspective anymore, it has become my new normal. It's time to try on sobriety. I have attempted to quit two weeks ago. To those out there with ADHD and that menstruate, try to time it right after our period. I had a horrible time trying to quit right before my period came on. I made the right decision this time, by spending time with my family on my first day off MJ, and I have been in such a good mood all day.

I am scared, yet I feel empowered. I am anxious and nervous, yet I am excited. 

When choosing Option 1, the road will be tough - no doubt. But when choosing Option 2, the road will be a LOT tougher.

Unfortunately, being stuck there the whole weekend led me to smoking weed and nicotine.

I have no weed at home since I've given everything to friends to hold onto. After vaping an obscene amount of nicotine last weekend and no weed to cover the nicotine cravings/withdrawals, I regrettably ended up buying a cheap disposable vape. The next day I tested positive for covid. 

Been quarantining and only vaping in the bathroom to hide it from my partner. I was humiliating myself like this until the vape died on Friday. And then with zero substances left to lean on as a crutch, I crashed. I've been too depressed and unmotivated to do anything besides lay around watching tv or playing on my phone. My partner is trying to help me get up and go outside, and I feel really bad. She doesn't deserve this pile of useless shit that I'm being.

Today is slightly better. I'm reaching out on here at least. I made it to day 7 even though I felt like crying all day yesterday. I didn't try to find my partner's tiny pipe for res. I resisted going out and buying more nicotine.

I just still feel twisted and knotted in my chest and stomach. And the brain fog from covid/withdrawal doesn't help at all.. 

I can't help but question if this is really worth not smoking. I feel broken. If I smoked for motivation I would at least get some things done as compared to how useless and sad I am all the time now.

I hope this gets better. I want to be able to produce my own happiness without using substances as a crutch. It's just hard to have any faith in my potential when everything seems to be grey.",3

Rn I’m 14 in sober and I’m feeling better than ever, I’m filling the gap left in my life with things I love, I think this is a big one to have succes, it’s not just quitting weed, taking something out of your life is hard af, so when we are already kinda dependent on something like weed you cannot just take it out, you need to replace it.

I’ve been replacing it with my college studies getting focused on them, and with a music project I’ve got going on.

Please, you need a purpose and something that fullfils to replace the weed, that’s my best advice for you fellow friend.

Been feeling ok up until today. I'm honestly not super tempted by the action of smoking, but I guess I had no idea how much of my chronic pain was being managed by the pot. 

I have an autoimmune disorder that causes me pretty terrible joint and nerve pain. I've had it under control for a few years, but I had to stop my fibro meds this year because of some unfortunate side effects. I was still doing pretty well lately... until today. I think the weed is finally starting to leave my system, because I woke up with terrible hip pain, and now the nerves in my back feel like a hot spiderweb that won't stop burning me. I know what it feels like when my symptoms start coming on strong, and I'm scared for the days ahead. I honestly had no idea that the weed was managing so much of my pain. I feel like shit. And now I'm remembering that the last time I went without weed for more then a month, I had a flair up so bad that I had to use my wheelchair. It's making me question whether I'm making the right choice. 

I really don't want to start smoking again, but I've been on like 10 different meds for my issues, and none of them have worked for longer then a few weeks. I have a super high tolerance to pain meds, and I refuse to get a prescription for anything addictive, so my doctors just kind of... gave up on trying to prescribe me anything. I thought I was doing ok without it, but I guess it was more the weed then me. 

What do I do? I don't want to go back now. I'm so proud that I've made it this far, but my hands are burning just typing this. Anyone else who used weed for pain have experience with quitting? I need help.",5

I started smoking both when I was 15 but it was always a small amount.  I QUIT literally cold turkey  when I was 19 to pursue a career in kickboxing (pro tip!! Do a sport when!!), but I had to stop boxing due heavy injuries.  

I am around 24 and gradually I started smoking both again. Alcohol joined the party and that's just life . 

Explicit content online was always there but moderate, at least not as bad as it would become.

Got a beautiful daughter around 27 but separated after 2 years with me ex so that depressed me as well. Met a great girl a year later and she stayed with me most of the time.

when I was 30 I really discovered the harder stuff, and the combination of this with drinking  and adulatory was one that really took me down. Around 32 I started to admit i was an alcoholic at best and a complete junkie at worst. I could not go a day without drinking, and before I knew it I was also doing smoking drinking  and adulatory  which was as my steady girlfriend, also daily practice and ""collecting "" like a maniac.  )

Tried to quit 100,s of times but always failed.
Around 36 I discovered  I COULDN'T HAVE A DROP WITHOUT LONGING FOR that strong stuff.

 Fast forward  to 2021 ,I am 37 and all my addictions totally control me. smoking at least 2 gram a day ,adult content binges that took up to 3 days sometimes...

Then the ""magic "" happened. Beginning  of  the  year  my girl kinda left me and the crisis that followed drove me to reconsider my life. I realized I was a total junkie and that my chances of being  the person I wants to be were diminishing 

Last weekend ,after six months absence did the strong stuff and drinking being depressed from the semi break up and went bad (like usual) and told myself this gotta end.  

Then literally 5 days ago my old coach called me up and invited me to come train some boxing. I happened  to be sober and just pushed me to stay sober till the training.  And I did it!! After 13 (!!l years of smoking mj daily I had my first day sober on Wednesday!! Pushed it 4 days further which seems like an eternity to me.  Also quit adult content because feeling /effects came scaring close to the strong stuff.. 

Now I am shaking sweating crying screaming. I go ham on ciqs but don't really like the taste.  it's like the demons of my addictions  are just laughing at me waiting for me to return. I actually  get quite emotional now just thinking about it. I enjoy being sober like it's a new high, but it's like I already  know  I will relapse.  

I never showed this much strength,  but I don't know if I can keep this  up . I wanna quit nicotine as well and get my good skin and teeth back if that's even possible. I want to pursue some long left behind dreams and business ideas and reach some fitness goals and be a good father for my daughter.  

This is my 5th day....ridiculous of course but to me it's like an eternity.  Tomorrow I  will  trie to stay away from the nicotine as long as possible.  Maybe I can live a clean life and be fit again like in my pro boxing days. But I fear for the worst....if anyone read this thanks alot.",13

Tonight, for the first time in almost 2 years, i sat down for family dinner and wasn’t silent! I was apart of the conversation! I felt so great about it, and i feel like my relationship with my parents is going back to where it used to be! 
All that being said and done, the bad days were absolutely terrible while sober, but the good days were 100x better while sober. I will take this happiness and occasionally sadness over the numbness i felt all the time! I feel like i actually can see my future.

2022-02-05 20:28:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/slmg6g/day_3_venting/,Day 3 venting,"CW; Mention of psychosis (I don't describe any of the actual symptoms) 

This is basically just a long ""I needed to share"" ramble.. and my first post.

It's taken me a long time to get here.. I was on day one for probably a year. Almost every single day I'd say ""that's it. I'm not smoking tomorrow. once I'm out I'm not buying anymore"" and every single time it was a lie, until now. 
I found this subreddit probably a few months ago.. and it's really helped. I won't lie, it did kind of make me feel bad about myself at first, but I guess addiction just feels shameful.. I would read peoples posts, never commenting or creating my own because I was still getting high constantly.. and I would feel so angry. I would sit here scrolling, and crying while stoned out of my mind just beating myself up for not being able to do it myself, but I've realized that every one of the posts I've read had the same (well, similar) starting points.. addicted, and defeated. I really attribute finally stopping to this subreddit, I was so happy to FINALLY find people who could talk about cannabis addiction openly.

I feel so lost being surrounded by people who act like weed isn't that bad, like I'm overexaggerating.. I feel like I can't even call myself an addict, I can't tell people I'm struggling. They just go ""pot? oh yeah whatever just take a tolerance break"" or something of the sorts. Even the people closest to me, who have watched me decline seem to be blind to it. I've always struggled with my mental health, but since smoking consistently it's gotten so much worse. I started smoking pretty regularly when it became legal in Canada in 2018, but it was just casual, on weekend evenings, and didnt really become a problem for 1-2 years.

I started having panic attacks. (high and sober) I've developed ""mysterious"" digestive issues that haven't been diagnosable, and likely just resulted from my mental health. (If you don't know about the brain-gut connection you should seriously research it, if you care.) The combination of these things caused me to leave my job without notice in 2020 (the stress of the pandemic didn't help, but it was just the final straw) and I've been jobless, and honestly agoraphobic ever since. Yet it feels like people still won't recognize that I'm struggling with addiction.

What has really pushed me to knowing that I HAVE to quit is I started to experience symptoms of psychosis.. I honestly haven't really told any of the people closest to me, because I just feel like they don't care, and are tired of hearing my problems, and will think I'm overexaggerating... just like everything else I complain about. The few friends I have told have pretty much just brushed it off with an ""oh that's not good."" I get that they probably don't even understand, or know how to respond.. I would probably feel similar if I were them, it just feels so lonely and invalidating. 

I am already noticing those symptoms deminishing, and although the person I live with may not know the extent of what I'm going through, they do know I've been struggling, and I do have people to make sure I'm safe. Figured I should add that, as I realize saying ""I'm experiencing psychosis and not telling people"" is probably a bit of a worrying statement. 

I should definitely be seeking professional help for my mental health, but it's just hard. It feels like such a fight to be heard and listened to even by them.. the free Canadian mental health system SUCKS, and I can't afford private. Its so demoralizing. My last therapist didn't think it was a big deal that I was smoking every day, and honestly made me feel like it was a valid coping mechanism. My therapist before that would go on and on about how I should join her belly dancing classes... lol. Like legit every session, I was starting to think there must be recruitment rewards. 

I'm just tired of fighting to be heard, it's so exhausting. 
Thanks for listening if you made it this far<3

For the past few months or so weed just hasn’t been fun, but I’ve kept smoking it anyway because it’s what I do. Time dilates uncomfortably, gravity feels 10x stronger, my thoughts form 10x slower, but I still smoke most nights. I think I’m more conscious of my lack of enjoyment now that I’m back at university rather than a boring job, and I have the foil of how I feel in seminars and writing essays sober, like my brain is on fire. Then when I come home and smoke I just feel like I’m slowly drowning. I’m purposefully lowering and inhibiting myself. And for what? 

When I look back now and think about this substance that I’ve dedicated so much of the formative years of my life to, I can’t help but think about how little I got out of it. I’ve been inert, anxious, asocial, had a bad relationship with food and body image, and failed to adequately express myself. Yes, I formed bonds with people, I had romantic relationships where weed was a major conduit for intimacy - but when circumstances changed and weed wasn’t available all of these connections weren’t able to sustain themselves. It was as if they were only half-alive, and we needed to partially blind ourselves to that fact in order to keep things afloat. 

I’m just worried that I won’t know who I am when I stop smoking weed. Since I moved cities I usually smoke alone so I’m not really worried about my social life being affected. It’s more just like smoking weed has been so deeply present throughout the formation of my identity that once I take it away I fear I won’t be fully certain of what I think or feel about my life, or if I’ll even recognise it. But the fact that I know this fear has the potential to manifest means that I have to allow it to happen. I need to wake up now. Time is passing.",10

I’ve spent most of my 20’s heavily relying on the herb to do just about anything and everything. What has made it so difficult to quit is having a job that doesn’t test and most of my friends are stoners. I love my job and it’s a good job, it’s just giving me the liberty to smoke whenever I please, even at work. Vapes and edibles make it so easy too. I got into a habit of smoking on my breaks and work itself seems to go much smoother when I’m stoned. I’ve tried not smoking at work, but I tend to get really irritated and flustered and it affects my work dramatically. It’s crazy that being sober at work is more of a burden to me than actually being a little stoned. It helps me relax and put my mind at ease. I’m much more focused on work as well, whereas when I’m sober, all I can think is I need a hit or else work is going to be overwhelming. I know I need to break that habit, but it’s definitely a challenge since I’ve gotten so used to having THC in me basically 24/7. 
Any advice from those who have gone through something similar? How to deal with the withdrawals at work while still being productive and not letting it affect my production?",2

We live together.","I'm in college currently doing a bunch of science classes. I'm going to have to quit smoking for a drug test in July for the program I'm trying to get into, anyway. But I know if I just quit, I'll be able to ace my classes, as they're pretty difficult right now and a lot of info to study. But, my fiancé refuses. We've had the conversation that weed will be in our lives forever. And it's a nice thought, if you don't have anything important you want to do with your life. I love weed, but I also hate that I'm not as sharp or energetic as I once was. I've been smoking heavy & daily for about 10 years now, I've quit a couple times for a few months at a time and its always great and I feel way better, but always end up relapsing. My fiancé and I have a 2.5 yr old boy, and he's started noticing that we smoke (besides my fiancé hitting his vape like 20x a day in front of us). I don't have an addictive personality, quite the opposite- I usually have pretty strong willpower. My fiancé is totally an addict. He's had a mix up with pills before we even met, so we don't allow pills in the household. And he vapes regularly, smokes weed regularly, and drinks to get f\*\*ed up at least 3 nights a week. His dad passed away Thanksgiving weekend 2021, so I understand right now is much harder than anything, they were super close.. My fiancé is definitely a difficult one. He is self-employed, though actively looking for a stable full time job because his self-employed wage is not nearly enough to pay bills. Though, for his line of work, (plumbing, handy man stuff) companies usually require a drug test, so it's been hard for him to find anything. But he still refuses to quit.

If anyone has advice on how can I quit and set boundaries for him, while also letting him continue to enjoy the weed somehow?",2

I have seen some inspiring posts on here lately so I want to give an update so people who are trying to quit can see that it does get better.

I had a rough go of it at first. I didn't expect it to be easy but I did expect for a quick turnaround on the mental fog and motivation issues. It took a while to really feel like myself again. I had just started school at my local community college after dropping out of college a few years prior. That first semester was hard. I struggled to get anything done and everything was way harder than I thought it should be. Plus I was working full time and going through withdrawal. I did okay my first semester but work was hell and I got way more stressed out by things than I did when I was smoking all the time. I had a few relapses as well. But, every time I fell off I got right back on the wagon. When I broke down and smoked I would throw away everything the next day in disgust. Wasted a few hundred bucks like that but it was worth it to not give myself the option. Finally, I got to a point where I didn't even want to smoke anymore. Work got easier and I enjoyed it more. School became simpler and more interesting. I got a promotion at my job and straight A's in school for the first time ever. Then, I got straight A's again the next semester. And I loved my job more than I ever had. This winter I graduated with my Associate's Degree Summa Cum Laude and got accepted to the top public school in my state to finish my Bachelor's (not bad for a college dropout). I even just got a new job as a reporter for the local news and I will have absolute freedom to write about what I want and to work from home. I am sorry if this sounds like bragging but genuinely I am so proud of myself (and you should be too for taking the first step and quitting). Things are, for the first time in my life, going my way. 

It was not an easy road to get here. I suffered and I relapsed and sometimes the only thing in the world that I wanted was to give up and smoke weed for the rest of my life. But man, weed is a coping mechanism and when you are coping by escaping the world you are not doing yourself any favors. The world may suck but it is the only one we have. Make the most out of your own life and do yourself the ultimate favor by being present for it. I still have my problems. Hell, I have a lot of problems that I need to work out. Weed is not to blame for everything. But my life is way better than it was, or ever could have been had I continued down the path I was on. I wish you all the best of luck in your journeys.

Following up with a bit more here:

-It takes time to feel the benefits

THC is fat soluble so it takes some time to be out of your system.
Your brain and body takes time to readjust and heal from the disruption of having THC in your system. 
For me, I could notice day by day, week, month, and year feeling a little better at a time.

-Protect your environment

Take up enjoyable hobbies, eat right, exercise, practice good sleep hygiene, all those good things.

-Embrace the suffering

Its tempting to avoid suffering - that has been taught to us through our conditioned reward experience - but it's often the path to enlightenment and growth.
Time suffering is often the highest rewarded time spent.

I’m highly functional high, but low physical effort from laziness, bad for my lungs, and the eventual loneliness just aren’t healthy. 

It’s relatively easy for me to go a few days not smoking if I take my adhd meds while eating and getting exercise. But the meds cause a loss of appetite and I work at the computer leading some very complicated engineering so I will just zone into that. Course as soon as I don’t eat properly or am off with time management these things spiral back and I smoke.

I’m getting married soon and want to make sure I handle these things better if I want to be a better partner and eventual father. 

I’ve gone to therapy and done most of all the processes. Some work to various degrees but a therapist feels so distant and not actually there when you need them. Then my routines eventually fall off. 

Would love any ideas on how to get through and keep on this journey better. Im fairly well off being in tech so open to spending some to get through it properly. 

A few ideas I’ve thought:
- gaming group 
- audiobook group
- support group that chats regularly 
- coach to help keep on track, probe into failures and talk about alternative options. I find my partner not the best at stress so I don’t want to bother her more on it and I know I will have some anger and depression as I go. 
- VR gaming and fitness group remotely 
- diet coach or cook",3

Mom's insulting me? Better stuff myself. 
Social anxiety? Nothing some junk food can't fix.

Now that I quit weed, you'd think that my appetite has decreased, but it's actually the opposite. I'm determined to give the best of myself, so I'll need to suck it up and move forward.

day 15 here and it has been surprisingly easy so far. But there has been evenings where I felt so damn lonely and depressed. Even though I have a quite a few friends I really trust, I feel like those relationships are quite shallow. It's not that they don't care for me but it's not on a really deep level I guess. 

I feel like am missing something. Someone who can really relate to how I am feeling. And also the physical contact. Just someone to cuddle and cry with. I don't wanna be strong and optimistic all the time. 

Last night I felt very depressed once again, so I hit the gym and sauna, had a good dinner and passed out on the couch.

Now I'm sitting in the garden of my nice flat, the sun shining on my face but I can't stop crying because I feel like I don't really have someone to share this with and everything feels so pointless.

I just had to write this down...

And don't worry, relapsing is not an option but just staying sober doesn't feel like a solution right now.",6

I wanted to check in with my fellow leavers to say the last 3 weeks have been rough, and I found it really hard after having 2 weeks of feeling the “high” of not smoking. Suddenly I was questioning so many things in my life and also had lots of stress come my way. 

I had super strong cravings at these points, I wouldn’t say I ever nearly caved, but my mind would wonder to how easy it would be to just give in and numb myself from all the stress. But I pushed through and I want you all to know it was so worth it! I’m coming back into feeling good again, not normal yet but more normal. The intrusive thoughts and overwhelming emotions are starting to settle. I have no doubt they will rise again but I know I can get through them. 

I’m giving myself the grace that my brain is going through something big and I’m healing it. Knowing I’m in the healing phase makes it easier and I’m starting to put less pressure on myself to feel great and normal straight away. This is life, life is not great or normal all the time. 

Smoking weed for so much of my adult life cost me learning how to handle things without my numbing agent. So now I’ve got to learn this, whilst detoxing, whilst healing. But today… today I feel calm. Today I feel proud I didn’t give in to those feelings. I’m proud that my body feels better, my skin looks better, my eyes brighter. I’m working out about 3 times a week and my fitness is better. My lungs are clearer, breathing is easier. I’m not waking up hung over from smoking, I’m getting shit done every day, all the stuff I put off or was too lazy to do. I’m proud that my bank balance isn’t taking such a hammering. Even when I feel bad inside I can see all the positive change I’m making around me. 

So to you all, if it’s hard remember there is still hope, it does get better, and even when it gets hard again know it gets better again too!",2

You never know what you're going to wake up remembering.

Last night I dreamt my very socially awkward, hermit (ish) mother, was dating someone! We were out in a little cabin in the woods somewhere on a road trip or something. She met a guy and she was super giddy because he was coming over. She even dressed up in a white skirt, pink sweater, and was asking for tips about her hair. She was making eggs, sausage and bacon in a frying pan (i woke up starving) and when he arrived instead of looking like he was in his 60s, he looked more like his 40s. I kinda called him out on this and was pretty suspicious the whole dream about his true age and intentions. He was nice I guess, but there was something odd about him for sure. I woke up shortly after that. This is sooo not my mother. lol

Cravings have been kind of rough lately but I'm hanging in there. Feels like a lifetime and I have so much further to go. Still making some moves in this short time I've quit though! I would like to workout next but been feeling kind of sick and rundown. I may rest one more weekend and start fresh tomorrow. Hope everyone else is hanging in there!

First few days were horrible, just really wanted to smoke and felt very bored.  Now, i still feel pretty bored because im now having to actively find things to do rather than be okay with being bored.  But the desire to smoke?? Almost completely gone it feels.  Sure i still think about it sometimes.  But my thoughts are more about the anxiety i know i would feel if i smoked it.

Ie. if were to smoke right now, does it really change anything about my situation? I have finally come to terms with the fact that getting high just isn't the answer.  I dont have that same uncontrollable urge to smoke. 

A little about me, i have a very addictive personality to things as well as people.  Really anything that can distract me from reality.  A few days ago i cut ties with a few women i had been seeing after my relationship ended.  I had to be truthful and let them know im not in a good place right now and i cant allow myself to replace one addiction with another again.  Being someone who has historically always needed someone to not feel alone.  This is a huge step.  

Feel even lonelier now but I hope one day I'll be able to have a healthy relationship not bound in addiction and necessity.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been an all day smoker for almost 10 years now (which feels bizarre to admit) and I've quit a few times for no longer than a month in that time, one specific time in like mid 2017 was going well, then me and a buddy's favorite guitarist died and we decided to smoke and listen to a bunch of albums. It's insane to me that this was just shy of 5 years ago, because it seems like since then, every other week I've been ""trying to quit"" and just couldn't capture the energy and enthusiasm I had to propel me through the hard times at the beginning ever again. 

&#x200B;

Deeper than that, it felt like I quit, then was super productive basically to keep myself busy, then fell back into the every day habit and nothing really changed? I feel like I lost my why is basically what I'm saying. This time my why is a little less abstract, because my breathing has been absolutely fucked (lifelong asthmatic) and I thought it was cause I got another cat, but low and behold, the last time I smoked is the last time I used my inhaler. It is a bit of a bummer though, because it feels like when I get on maintenance medication now that my health insurance situation is sorted, I don't really know if I have a strong reason to want to quit anymore. On a deeper level I know that I can't really reconcile being a lifelong stoner and it makes me feel weak to be so reliant on something so silly, so does anyone have any tangible upsides to quitting long term? Or even just some words of advice to help keep someone on the horse who's maybe fundamentally less concerned with quitting than they once were, but knows they want to?

&#x200B;

I'm reasonably functional regardless, full time job, exercise hard, and I have a decent amount going on in my free time, socially and personally, and I think that might be part of the problem. It's easy to convince yourself not to give a shit if you're keeping it together pretty well. It's really the breathing, reliance, and to a certain extent finances that are driving me this time, and it'd be sweet to know some awesome benefits other people have had! Especially anything you didn't expect!

&#x200B;

Sorry for the crazy ramblings, hopefully some of this makes sense and if not I'd be happy to clarify!

TL:DR - I've quit briefly before, don't know if I care as much to anymore, but I'd like to. Please help me rekindle kind reddit folk",3

I’m approaching my first weekend weed free and starting to get anxious. I can keep myself busy during the day with work and projects but the after dinner/wind down time is what I most heavily associate with getting high - especially on the weekends. Movies and video games were always accompanied by a few bowls. I’m finding less interest in doing these things now that I can’t smoke. It’s like I can’t sit still or else my addict brain starts to tell me to smoke and I’m more susceptible to believing it. What do y’all do?,15

I had to fully convince myself that weed was stunting my self growth. Quitting seemed so daunting, but I managed to stick with it.

I still have cravings, I still have weed dreams. But mostly it’s easy to override them. After over a decade of heavy weed consumption, I really stopped valuing being high. I now value the clarity and confidence.

I love music

I love it so much that I watch videos on a daily basis about it, I play an instrument and seek to learn more and even will attempt to go to a musical program to make it my job, who said that your real job couldn't be your passion ?

I was watching a video from Rick Beato (music producer and Youtuber) where he said that he could name at least 5 other songs that sounds similar to the song he was talking about.

So I tried to find 5... or 3... at least 1...

But I couldn't... not that I don't know enough about music theory, but that I just can't recall anything...

Nothing...

Unless I go check or extensively think about it... 

I don't know which artists I listen to, I don't know which song i've been listening to, I don't know what are my favorites meals, I don't know what I like or used to like in life, I don't know the things i've learned, I don't know what are my qualities nor my flaws, I don't know what's going on in my life, I don't know what happened in my childhood, I don't know what's happening to me, I don't know how to explain how I feel nor who I am...

I just don't... or maybe I just can't...

This moment where you starts to question yourself, if you've lost a significant portion of your memories... or if you've just lost the key to access them ?

**Q : And can I ever find it ?**

I'm currently 19, have smoked on a daily basis since 16 to 18 from joints to dab pen, from a bowl to 5 dab a day. Took a 3 months break then relapsed because I couldn't control it; i've been sober for 5 days.

I'm anxious, emotionally detached (apathy) from everything, have a horrible memory and my life is basically on auto-pilot

That's not what I wanted

If your old-self tells you you should try again just once, know he's a liar.

TL;DR : I'm 19, I have smoked daily for 2 years and relapsed once. My memory and sense of self is now completely jacked, my greatest wish in life would be to feel normal again, will my memory improve at least a bit ?",7

After a series of major life changes and stressors, I relapsed this fall. A rise of Omicron cases gave me an excuse to justify staying at home and sitting on my ass getting blazed. Too much pot still triggered anxiety, but I realized if I only took a couple of hits, I wouldn't get as anxious and paranoid. However, I've been taking a couple hits every few hours and it's turning me into a lazy, unmotivated homebody. I'm naturally an extrovert and adventurous, and when I don't interact with others, exercise, or get out of the house, it causes a deep depression for me. Pot leads to isolating behaviors that trigger depressive episodes. I also got a nasty bout of bronchitis this winter, which I know pot made worse. I'm tired of wasting precious life living this way. I still plan to be socially careful until the pandemic is more under control, but I need more than binging pot and watching television.

**A little bit about myself**: I turn 24 years on February 19th and have smoked/ingested THC since I was 13 years old but I don't necessarily regret starting so young. I have a well paying job and actually just purchased my first home at the age of 23 and don't really feel like it has affected the financial/education aspects of my life. 


**Where it has become a problem**: I feel as of recently (within the past few years) I have begun to use weed as more of a crutch for my emotional/pain issues. I have become more withdrawn lately and it started to affect my relationship with my girlfriend and those around me. I've felt myself becoming very pessimistic and depressed (I've always struggled with slight depression and anxiety but it has gotten a lot worse over the years). 


I tend to only get things done with I absolutely have too, even though there are many things I genuinely want to do, however I always seem to regress back to getting high and then losing the drive to do things I actually want to do; simple things such as taking my trash out or doing the dishes. I hope I don't come off as blaming marijuana for all the negative aspects in my life because there are definitely other contributing factors, however I do believe that my lack of self control with it has contributed to it greatly which is why I have decided to stop completely. 


When I do get high, I feel happy. I feel as if my depression goes away but that's only for a very, very short time and when the high ends, I tend to feel worse than before I had smoked. I'm currently on my 3rd day no THC; I took almost the whole month off from work and I'm actually on a little vacation at the moment to visit my parents to help take my mind off of my withdrawal symptoms (a bit of nausea, irritability, and just generally feeling unhappy due to lack of dopamine(?) ). 


Quitting cold turkey has been hard, I almost failed the very first day. I had half a joint in my ash tray that I threw away into the garbage and was extremely tempted to fish it out and smoke it. That alone was enough to solidify the thought that I needed to stop, I've been addicted and honestly felt disgusted with myself. I'm 100% one of those people who would tell myself that I could quit whenever I want or that I really had no reason to so why would I? but that was just me lying to myself in order to cope with my addiction to it and the fact that I've been okay with doing nothing for so long. 


I've heard the phrase ""Weed makes doing nothing more interesting"" and while that may be true, for someone with an addictive personality, such as myself, it's a very dangerous combination. The pandemic has made it hard for all of us to want to leave the house but it has been an issue for me for as long as I could remember. My girlfriend would want to go out and do something, I would tell her yes of course we can! and low and behold, hours later I would've smoked and went back on my word, but I didn't care about the disappointment I was causing, because I was content staying home. She even said she has started to resent me a little bit as well, which has been a real breaking point for me.


**So, what now?**: I continue to get better, hopefully. I have recently started seeing a psychiatrist to address other issues related to my mental health. I had bloodwork done for the first time in 5 years and to my surprise, I'm extremely vitamin D deficient lol. The past week I've been trying to drink a lot more water and even trying to go for more daily walks like I used to do when I was a bit younger.


For the first time in awhile, I feel a bit excited to go on in life because lately I've been feeling like there hasn't been a point to anymore; going through the motions everyday just surviving. The withdrawal symptoms aren't super terrible, at least at the moment and I'm very hopeful that everyday I'll continue to feel better in my own skin and to build back up the relationships I've damaged over the years.


I don't think I've ever written a post this long on Reddit before, so I apologize for the novel but it has felt good to lay it out for anyone who wants to listen, I'd appreciate some personal anecdotes and words of encouragement/strategies that some of you have used if you've been in a similar situation as I have.

Peeling off the bandaid to have the wounds reopen and taking off the THC emotional support blankie leaves me overwhelmed facing a bunch of repressed feelings, trauma etc. Get really down, anxious, despondent and want to ""hide"" but no more blankie to hide behind.

I know that eventually over time it's going to regulate out but when those feelings wash over me it's really overwhelming. Hoping that quitting will level things out in time (it KIIINDA did when I had a 6 month break in 2019-2020) but also realizing that they're not going to go away on their own. 

Actually addressing the issues is tough. When I was really tempted to smoke I forced myself to text/call all of the people I had been thinking about reaching out to but hadn't. Get back on the exercise, meditation and reading routine. Writing in the journal. It's tough to ""keep it up"" and I've fallen off a dozen times from keeping the routine when my emotional baggage/trauma BS comes boomeranging back I slip up and don't ""feel like"" doing the healthy shit to heal.

So now I'm trying to figure out what sorts of things do you guys find helpful when you're in one of those fuck the world, crappy moods and don't wanna do the 'self care' stuff?

We invest our hard earned money into these leaves (or in my case the carts) and for what? To feel shitty about it, promise this is your last one, kill the whole thing just as fast or faster than the last one only to hop onto the “I need to wean off, cold Turkey never works” roundabout all over again. There IS NO weaning off, not for the meanest bud smokers this side of the Milky Way Galaxy. We are an all or nothing class of creature, “moderation is for cowards” but this too applies to our newfound sobriety if we can choose to smoke everyday we can just as easily shut it off don’t let your mind tell you any different. It disguises itself as your conscious trying to help you but its real name is addiction and it hates us, it wants us dead and broke and doesn’t care what order it happens in. I used to green out every time I smoked, I’d feel straight up schizo and hated it so there was never a chance of addiction, but then I fell into carts hard in junior year of high school. I was drowning out the sadness of willingly pushing away the only woman who’s ever made me feel “completely vulnerable” she loved me and I was freaked out by how much I loved her so I told her I didn’t, she moved on in a way that hurt me and I can’t blame her, idk what I expected. I couldn’t deal with it back then but the West Coasts could, the Brass Knuckles the TBK, the Exotics the King Pens, you name it I ripped it, and most likely got ripped off buying it ($60,$70 tanks that I can get for $40 today) in those days I had summer job money when most other kids didn’t because their moms and dads just gave them their money in a slow drip, my parents gave me the world as well but they believed in hard work for your money, no handouts. I had a few thousand to my name for spending however I pleased and nothing I cared to buy except more weed (or juul, I still rip that daily sadly) so that’s what I did, but I guess I blinked or something because one second I’m having my multi-daily seshes in the high school bathroom and now I’m here a 20 year old in community college wondering where the last 4ish years went, and who I need to talk to in order to get them back. My walk in the fog left me with no concrete ideas/plans on where I wanted my life to be, and even less of a perception on who I am. You can’t see your own hands in front of you when you’re in the fog, so how do you expect to chart out the map that leads to your unwavering contentment with life? The answer is you can’t, or at least I can’t. I’m clean of bud  since late last January after no tbreaks since 2018 and it only happened because my local ATM was broken, but I’ve taken it as a sign from the man who pulls the strings and intend to take full advantage of this opportunity to get clean. I’m so fed up with judging myself, getting to places on time only to end up late anyway because I’m in my car chain ripping pen before I go in for whatever non-weed necessary task I’m about to preform, clapped up like Snoop Dogg, telling myself it’s not an issue. Fellow rippers the amount of money we’d have today if we never let it get to this point is truly unimaginable (unimaginable because if we did do that math we’ll really hate ourselves😛). We can’t change the past and THERE IS NO FUTURE, we can only take the present by the nuts and bend it to our will, it has no choice, we are infinitely powerful and undeniably irrefutable.

2022-02-04 03:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sk818r/day_1/,Day 1?,"Hello everyone,

I have been smoking daily with few tolerance breaks here and there for about 10 years now. I am currently 27. 

When I first started, weed was the best thing in the world for me. It elevated every experience. I found amazing friends. I was no longer anxious to try new things. On top of that, my performance in school or athletics didnt really decline. I loved smoking and doing my homework, or smoking and playing basketball. To this day, I still love to smoke before I go out to play basketball or exercise or before I tackle something work-related. 

The past few years I have started to feel the negatives. The first hit after waking up feels great but as everyone here might know, the rest of the day is spent chasing that high. I want to stop... I think... but when the time comes to actually do it I feel like my brain plays tricks on me and forces me to go back to the habit.

I realized something though. The times that I actually stop smoking or decrease my usage, it is because some exterior event was forced upon me. The last tolerance break I took was last year for about 2 months, but this was only because my mother was hospitalized for covid-19 and I needed to be alert and around for her. Today, I have stopped waking and baking and only smoke after my work day is over around 5 pm. I used to smoke 4-5 joints a day when I was home but since I started my job, I only smoke a joint a day or less at night. I am not angry or anxious or struggling with these changes. When outside events are forced upon me to stop smoking I seem to cope fine.

I decided last week, that the next batch I pickup I will only smoke on weekends. Last night, I ran out and I want to pick up again today and just smoke on the weekends. But a part of me also wants to stop. For once, I want to kick the habit myself because despite all these outside events helping me, it is also the reason that I can't seem to let go for good. I know all this and yet as the clock ticks closer to my day being over, all I can think about is calling my dealer and going home to roll one up.

I have a beautiful wife who is so supportive of everything I do. I want to have a family with her one day (we discussed possibly in the next 2-3 years of having children). A part of me feels like that will be the day I finally quit because I know myself. A part of me wants to quit today to prove to myself that I can do this. But a part of me just wants to go home to some pot so that I can smoke quickly and go on to my other activities like playing basketball today. I just dont know whether to challenge myself today or to still take the small steps that seemed to have been working? But I know it doesn't work too because only weekends can easily turn into one joint a day again and so on and so on...

This community has meant so much to me these past few weeks. Reading about people that are just like me and going through the same things as me have been empowering to say the least. Please guys, am I just delaying the inevitable? Am I being too hard on myself? When you're high its so easy to imagine the sober version of you doing great things but when you're sober, all you can think about is getting high. :(",6

I've been struggling and I'm glad I found this reddit community. For context, I have a history with anxiety and depression, and I've only known to cope with weed unfortunately. I have a million things in my head, so let me start with the situation. 

I smoked multiple times everyday for the past 4.5 years now (basically my 4 years of university). We always smoked flower, maybe had an occasional edible. I have tried, and failed, in the past few months  to properly quit. It's been an agonizing time. But it's worse... Through a long story of situations and decisions, I made probably the worse decision of my life so far in buying a weed pen. It was supposed to help me quit, but it was a terrible mistake. Overall I was intaking much more THC per whatever time measurement compared to when I smoked flower, since I would hit the pen multiple times an hour for no reason.   

When I could finally pull away, I started lowering my intake first, but I found that within 4-5 hours of hitting the pen, I would feel withdrawals. The fact that I felt it within hours shook me because that meant the peak would be something so bad I've never experienced it before, right? On top of the instant withdrawals, I also began feeling sad and ""down"" (now that I know I was). I had never dealt with a psychologically related withdrawal, and it fucking sucked. In 5 days of lowered tolerance I relapsed back into a craze. 

I've managed to pull away again now, 2 weeks later. I decided I'll try cold turkey because maybe that's what I need, but I'm terrified. I'm 4 days into being clean, and it's already been hell. The physical withdrawals suck so much, but they're something I've experienced before at least. I'm terrified of what's to come however. I feel a faint headache these past few days, I know it'll turn into raging headaches that leave me unfunctional, as I've experienced, but what if there's more? 

Sometimes I sit in my chair doing absolutely nothing. The physical withdrawals are unbearable and scare me in their own way. My mental health is what concerns me even more. My anxiety gets the best of me and I can't stop thinking about how it's been 6+ months of trying, yet here I am with somehow negative fucking progress. I haven't done anything productive in life since I've graduated either, and it's ripping me apart now that I'm not mind numb from it. 

I had some questions concerning my withdrawals, but the post got too long and I lost my direction. It just turned into some sort of ramble, which still helped in its own way. If you've read this far thank you so much for your time.",3

I'm close to 20 years daily use, with the exception of a few days here and there, and ALMOST ONE MONTH break 2 years ago. There was something special kicking in after about 2 weeks... Not that I didn't kind of miss it, not that I won't ALWAYS kind of miss it.

I wanted to stop again after kicking alcohol, which was way worse for my mental state. Then the spotlight was on weed again. 

When you're used to being a habitual user, being high is like mental security blanket... It scratches the itch. Probably at some point before the routine set in, it was still a mental state that was unique and had new insights you could apply to life.

It sucks that that disappears for most people who are on this Sub. It's like a loss. We can keep doing it, it's not like being a lifelong pothead is an evil thing, but it's just like a lesser version of the experience we're reaching for. 

So what's the point of being stronger than the urge to keep on keeping on?

I guess it's that sparkle. It's minor things, but LOTS of them. The sparkle I got from getting high early on was cool. But oddly when I'm calm and sober now, the sparkle is there instead. It's easier to look into people's eyes, and give a fuck about them. It's easier to remember the details of what you enjoy and why. There's deeper appreciation, not just a slutty rush of foggy joy.

But FUCK is it hard to not want it. Just cause it's an experience. We've all had good and bad highs, some in-between. But life is an experience, and all the little experiences within that big experience, are tempting. Why as humans would we not want more experience? I guess the sad thing is that for experienced marijuana users the end result of being ""high"" is a lot of smoke and mirrors. It's kinda one-note, boring, predictable and dull. Sure you can take a break, gain a little tolerance, get high and feel pretty interesting, for some of the duration of the high. But it's still kinda lame. And when the high dissipates it's even lamer.

If it provides some sort of medicinal relief (naseau, anti-anxiety, pain relief) that can be useful... Even if you don't ""need"" it medically. It's hard to dispute that. However, getting high cause it's always been your thing, it just doesn't really do anything except check the same box over and over and over again. It's meh.

Yea... So I think about it often, getting high that is...
... less when I'm happily distracted though.

I can do tomorrow, I can probably do next week too. Even one month, yea probably will be able to do it.

But beyond? It's frustrating to know I'll eventually feel compelled to get back into it. I wish there was like a marijuana 2.0 to use. Something just as interesting as good old weed once was. 

It doesn't provide anything useful to implement into life. It's just a different state of mind and doesn't seem to ""enhance"" like I hoped it would. It's very easy to tell yourself that it enhances everything. Sex, movies, music, skiing, mountain biking, driving, yoga, exercising, chatting, cooking, you name it... I've convinced myself it's the ultimate one up to every event and activity. But is it?
 
I want stopping to be easier than it is. I wish altering your state didn't seem so appealing, even when you know deep down that that other state is something you know ALL TOO WELL. It lures you in, cause the grass is always greener, and the more sober I stay the more the sober me will want something different.

Sure, today I'm overall happy that I'm trying to reform. 
I don't think ""moderation"" is the magic answer. In the long term, I wish I can help sustain the magic of life without falling back into chasing the magic of a false promise. I have a lot to be grateful for in life, as well as positive outlets. But I know the idea of something beyond the sober thoughts in my head will always make my soul yearn. 

Thoughts on how to stay satisfied with the simple, clean mind?

Have a great day everyone✌️",22

You got a lonesome road to walk.
It ain’t along the railroad track.
It ain’t along the black-top tar
You’ve walked a hundred times before.
I’ll tell you where the real road lies:
Between your ears, behind your eyes.
That is the path to Paradise,
And, likewise, the road to ruin.

-Hadestown by Anaïs Mitchell 

I’ve been thinking about these words all night, and how at the end of the day it is our choice of if we want to achieve paradise and create a better life for ourselves by going sober, or continuing with our addictions and ruining our paradise, and it’s simply in our brains! 

to me, this means that sobriety itself isn’t hard, but our own mental reactions to it. if we can overcome our reactions, we can take the path to sobriety easily!

i hope this helps someone the way these lyrics helped me!",8

I had stopped for 6 months at one point and its almost like that never happened, I can't even remember how easy or difficult it was.  I just hate the idea of always, ALWAYS needing to make sobriety a priority in my life.  It's never going to stop being a daily battle, and I'm just tired of fighting.

2022-02-03 18:10:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sjxdid/day_3/,Day 3,"Not much to report except that my brain won't stop thinking about weed. It's literally just a background thought that is constantly there. And I mean fucking CONSTANTLY. I'm glad that I don't have weed right now, because if I had, I'd have already found 30 different excuses for why ""one little smoke just to take the edge off"" would be a good and logical thing to do. I reckon it'll take a long time to rewire my brain so that thoughtprocess will disappear.

I'm surprised it's not as physically taxing as I expected, but there are still things: today I woke up exhausted and felt like if I had a small weed/alcohol hangover which was very weird. I had a glass of red wine for lunch and a non alcoholic beer at night the day before, so it can't be alcohol and obviously not weed. That was confusing.
But! I realized another weird thing: I'm not having night sweats. Why? I used to get them really bad when I would visit my parents even for a couple of days. Every night I would wake up multiple times completely drenched and freezing at the same time. 

Same (the night sweats) happened to my husband. At the time (years ago) we'd say ""oh must be the down comforter that traps more heat and we're only used to synthetic blablabla"" each of us knowing deep down what the actual reason was but not talking about it. That is when I should have realized I was addicted - heck, my body was going through withdrawal just 24 hours after my last joint! But then again, the addict brain is excellent at pushing down these thoughts and believe the lies you tell yourself because it's easier than confronting (and even harder: acting on) the truth. 

I'm kind of optimistic, but also scared in a way that you get scared when things seem to go too well, you know? I read about the honeymoon phase and I worry that that maybe happening to me and that is all downhill from here. The good thing is tomorrow I'm going on a trip to the city I lived in for 18 years and I'll see my friends, go out to eat and just walk around and enjoy what was my chosen home up until 1.5 years ago. (I really miss it!) So I'll be super occupied which is a good thing! But I know that coming back from trips with friends I need time to recharge from all that social interaction and I will do that for the first time without weed. So that will be... Interesting. But I'm getting ahead of myself (which is a thing I do and am trying to curb) because until it happens I won't know what happens. 

Like my father says: wait for the itch to start scratching (doesn't have the same ring to it in English, but you get the gist. Can't act until you know what you are acting on, everything else is futile and maybe misdirected)

Writing here and putting everything into words is kind of cathartic and the community is honestly amazing. And since I'm incapable of keeping it short and sweet I just let myself ramble on. I'm also consciously trying to be completely honest with myself here and not exclude ""shameful"" thoughts or embarrassing stuff. I like to think that future me would like to reread and understand the journey and you only can get a good overview/analysis if your data is correct and not distorted.",3

I never realized I wasn’t dreaming until I started dreaming again. My sleep is pretty broken still but I also have a young baby so that hasn’t helped much which is fine and expected. 

Now what I did not expect was how my digestive system has taken a long time to come back to some relative normalcy. Since quitting weed my movements have been very irregular and just kinda disappointing. I have eaten about 2 kilograms of kimchi and always apple cider vinegar but this has not seemed to help. Usually this routine keeps me pretty vacated in the lower unit but this has really emphasized to me that there is so much to this plant that I have overlooked. The only other times I’ve quit cannabis were when travelling abroad and I noticed changes in digestion but always attributed it to the time zones and poor diet. Now I firmly believe those dietary challenges were more related to laying off the green than anything else. 

This is merely an observation and it really just nails down the complexities that I overlooked. Now I gotta go have a disappointing sit down. Please pass the kimchi. Cheers leavers.",10

I wanted to share the positive impacts that it's had on my life in hopes that it will inspire some people to get over the relapses. 
After making one change for the better in my life it has started a domino effect of positivity.

I meditate and workout daily; these activities give me the good chemicals in mah brain. 
I have started eating healthier and learning to cook some awesome meals.
I've been able to control my happiness through ways other than depending on a substance.
I've also taken up reading and plan to fill my time with better and more useful stimulation. 
Last but also, most importantly, I've been able to start towards a new career path. I'm signed up to take some fire science classes and hopefully get started in the fall. 
Although these things may not seem correlated to cannabis consumption, to me, they were. 

I don't think I would have made the changes listed above if I didn't quit smoking. Alot of which are things that I've avoided because of laziness and not getting the same feeling of joy from doing them that I get now. I would do the things above if I was stoned and that would have been my ticket to the dopamine. Getting those same chemicals without having to change my mind state to get them has been huge. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I figured I'd mention how this was possible . Without smoking I noticed my energy levels returning in a couple of weeks. My attention and thought process is alot smoother without the distraction as well. My anxiety and depression have actually gone down.( Which is funny because that's why I smoked..med card). I have also mended and strengthened important relationships to me. Some that are focused on an entirely different perspective..

I'll leave you with this.. If you really want to make it happen, stick with it and implement new changes to take up the space that weed used to fill in your life. These added hobbies and long term goals are what really allowed me to stick with it. I know I'm only a month I'm but things feel different this time and it's something I want to stick with. It hasn't been easy but a great quote to end things on is this.

I started smoking cannabis at the age of 14, from there on it became a daily addiction. I’m now currently 26 and quitting! Oh, How times have changed.

THC became a huge part of my life at an early age. I didn’t understand the harm it was doing to my self or the seriousness of addiction. I think my biggest blinder was thinking it was a plant, what harm can it do? I now have been diagnosed with short term memory loss. I’m not saying this diagnosis came exactly from cannabis but perhaps it didn’t help.

My side effects started from the moment my addiction began. When I’d smoke I’d faint. Not green out but faint. I think as I continued to use I had a tolerance where I wouldn’t faint as often. Now when it comes to edibles that’s where it gets dangerous. I will faint even hours after use (6-8+) get cold sweats, and even experience swelling around my eyes and face as well as congestion and stuffy nose/sneezing. I thought all of this was a normal experience with cannabis use.

Every doctor I’ve ever seen has advised me to quit. I do suffer with mental illness aside from all of this and I thought THC was helping so I just continued using for years. My therapist and I have talked about a quit plan many times and I never felt ready to do it.

Last year I visited an allergy specialist who was doing a routine allergy test on me. She asked if she could test me for cannabis. I agreed she should as I was curious. Fast forward to the test being completed it was obvious I’m allergic to cannabis. She prescribed me an epipen to keep because I told her I’d continue to use.I could go into anaphylactic shock at any time 8 hours after using. I told her about my side effects and she said they were all related to the allergy.

After this diagnosis I started to pay more attention to my side effects and it really scared me. I consume something daily that is harmful to my body and mind. This is when I decided it’s time to quit.

So here is how I’m doing it. I started by cutting back the percentage of THC in the cannabis I’d be smoking, lowering my tolerance. I am currently at 5%THC . After this jar I will continue to go as low as 2% and then stop. Keep in mind my THC usage is once daily.

My purpose of sharing this is perhaps it will help those who also have an allergy and aren’t aware. I also would like to share my quit plan as it’s been helping me.",2

The first obstacle I have is that my drive to do things is gone. Everytime I want to do something my brain tells me: ""meh, i'm not in the mood"". It irritates me, when I smoked, I could be excited to put a work out in or watching a movie. Now, these things are ""boring"". The first couple of days I was looking forward to the next day so I could meditate, read another paragraph in my book or to work out. This is completly gone. I was wondering, is this ""boredom"" normal? 

The other obstacle I face is random moments of insecurity. When I just think I'm failing in life, that I'm ugly or that I will succeed in what I'm doing. Its frustrating because I know that's not me, and I want to feel 'normal' so bad. Do some of you have the same obstacles? Any tips?

&#x200B;

Threw away my stash 9 days ago. Smoked carpet weed 3 days ago after the cravings were too much.

After smoking, I snapped and drove down to an ATM to take out cash to buy more. I told myself that if I ""just switched to a different strain"" that it would be different. I pull up to the drive thru atm. In front of me, there's a van full of teenagers. I guess they all had accounts with this bank, because they took turns withdrawing in between joking around. 

&#x200B;

I waited, bouncing my leg and texting my plug. After 5 minutes of just sitting there, it dawned on me where I was. I was about to withdraw money from my dwindling bank account to buy weed. The last 20 times I've done this, I'll smoke for 2 weeks, regret it, and throw away what was left of my stash. I've been wanting to stop for a while, and yet, my brain made excuses to go back to it. 

&#x200B;

After 10 minutes, those kids were still at the atm, laughing and waving their McDonald's cups around as they let the next person withdraw cash. I told myself ""if I want some weed, I can always get it tomorrow."" I drove around the atm line and went home. 

&#x200B;

I haven't bought a new stash still. 

&#x200B;

Backstory/Rambling:

It's been hard to admit, but I've been extremely lonely since moving to a new state 2 years ago. It was (still is) so hard to make plans and hang out with people. if I was going to stay home anyway, weed was a way of making those lonely times ""fun""

&#x200B;

But they aren't fun. Weed just masked the boredom and depression in my brain. When I woke up the next day,  I was still lonely, just progressively fatter from the munchies. 

&#x200B;

I'm tired of feeling bad, and I'm tired of this plant looking like a solution when it's just my junkie brain craving another short-lasting dopamine hit.",30

the thing is, when i smoke i'm not consciously saying ""i'm gonna smoke to feel happier"" or whatever, it's subconscious. im subconsciously trying to fill the void in my chest, but the more i smoke, the bigger it gets. what i need is to be more aware of my brain, and i've somehow broken the association between weed and feeling good. even though i know i'll smoke and i'll feel good when i do it, i won't, because i'm focused on the good feelings i will get if i don’t smoke. i am proud of myself now, i feel free, i'm excited to do all the things i wasn't able to when i was high all the time. i'm more present with the kids at my job, with my friends, with my eating, everything. i know i will be able to make more room for things that will fill that void, and not just for a few hours; for much longer, and thats what's keeping me going. i'm kinda sad that i can't even just smoke with my friends on the weekend, because it’s nice just sometimes, but i've finally accepted that it's fucking worth it to really stop. and i DONT NEED IT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME! i just don't. and i also keep getting sick, my chest is itchy and sore and my phlegm is like, from another planet...i have a horrible cough...i'm tired of putting so much strain on my heart. i want to be happy and healthy and even though i feel empty inside, im so fucking happy i decided to do this and im so FUCKING PROUD OF MYSELF!! 😏😏😏😏 i wish everyone else here the best, fuck weed. fuck that stupid, beautiful, amazing, evil plant. yes, weed is beautiful, but living life to the fullest is way fucking better!!!!",6

And sure, maybe for some time, but never long term. I believe I needed to wrestle with my usage to get to this point of knowing I need to put it behind me. I had to slowly detach my identity from being a pothead. I’ve been smoking regularly for half my life and used to really enjoy the parasocial relationships watching stoner influencers toke up. After all, if they’re making money off of it and living this beautiful, fun life then weed can’t possibly be that bad for you right? Other people just don’t get the culture. /s

I still don’t feel ready. I know my mind will flip on me probably by this evening. I’ve bought distraction snacks, have hobbies and activities lined up, downloaded sobriety apps, and have talked to my partner. I still feel worried. Like I’m going to cave. I live across the street from a dispensary and my mind can play cruel games. But this time, I want to put in the work of trying. Reaching out, using the discord, and actually taking it one day at a time.

The company I kept, my drinking problem, the food I ate, my lack of proper sleep and rest, and just about every other decision I made throughout the day.  I feel I've now started life over as something of an empty vessel, though one with a career (amazingly enough), kids, and 'acquaintances', I wouldn't exactly call them friends.  It's sad looking in the mirror and seeing a man in his 50's that thought he was living life all this time, but wasn't.  I haven't been on a 2nd date in 25 years.  Long ago I married someone with even more addiction issues than me and it finally ran it's course.  I now find I can't relate to women that spent their lives focused on a healthy family, career, and hobbies other than being stoned and living in a cave.  I feel 'dirty' compared to them.  70 days isn't much compared to almost 11,000 days, so I do hope I'll learn to adjust, but time is not my friend and I don't expect there to be *more* options later.  

But there has been some good.  I'm so much sharper and focused.  And leaner.  Apparently when you're saturated with thc, you need more body fat to hold all of it.  I sleep better.  And my God - the dreams, they're insane and quite vivid.  I haven't dreamed like this since I was a child.  I've saved thousands of dollars already.  I read a lot now.  Overall, I'm very happy I was able to put it down and have no interest in smoking it again, not even for a special occasion.  I just wish I'd done it a long time ago.",27

Took everything in me to do what I've thought of doing 1000x (actually, I always thought I'd ceremonially lob it into the forest, but I decided not to litter,) but it's gone, and the second it tipped in I felt overwhelming relief.

Partly thanks to this community. I discovered it three days ago, read through the top rated post, let it percolate a bit, smoked up last night, woke up cloudy this morning, nearly missed a call with a mentor, and realized this was the last time I was going to merely think about throwing it out. I should think this is final too, because I /don't/ have the money to buy it all over again.

I'm writing this post to keep myself accountable as much as I am writing it to connect with people who recognize themselves in this.

I'm a bit of a productivity freak. I'm a freelance music producer, so if I don't feel like I'm working towards the next paycheque during the day, I feel useless. Which means I busy myself day in and day out to the point of burnout, and by 8 or 9pm, I'm so exhausted and mentally spent that I just want to ""wind down."" You can guess where this is going.

But lately I've realized that I've locked myself into a self-perpetuating cycle by doing this.

&#x200B;

* I stay up way too late for no reason, so I never get a full, satisfying sleep
* That makes me cloudy and ineffective and ""hung over"" the next day, so I miss time, perform poorer than I could, and end up exhausting myself again before 8 or 9pm, ad infinitum
* Listening to music high, the thing that got me hooked in the first place, is something I never do anymore anyway. I just end up binge watching Veep for the 20th time (great show, though)
* I eat like shit when I do this and keep completely countering all the healthy habits I've struggled to build in the last year, like mountain biking daily or sticking to any reasonable eating hours
* It's sort of just... lost it's magic. All it is now is that comfortable numbness. And, there are nights where I still prefer this over making the effort to go out and spend time with people. That's... bad.
* As above, so below. Weed is about comfort. I can't aspire to have groundbreaking change in my life if my MO is drowning out valuable pain and discomfort.

&#x200B;

At a time when I should be as sober as can be to build the business I've decided to build, all the useful pain and tension that would normally all be teachable moments just ends up drowning under this comfortable nothingness. 

I look at all my mentors that I speak with, and the unspoken truth is that they've left this ""Peter Pan'ing"" long ago, or, at worst, returned to it with considerable control after they've already built their foundation.

Today I realized that while smoking weed gave me a lot of really fun nights and helped me get through this godawful time we're all collectively going through, I just can't afford to entangle with it right now. I /need/ those pain points, I /need/ the discomfort, because there are crucial questions lurking there that I need to start answering in order to grow as a person. 

I'd like to think that if you told me the world was ending tomorrow, smoking up would be the last thing that crossed my mind. I want to run into life, not away from it. So why do I run away from the small, mundane apocalpyses that punctuate daily life?

I am really grateful for this community. Thank you for the courage and understanding, friends!",4

By the time I was 17 it turned into a daily habit where I was smoking multiple times a day. Fast forward some years and I'm turning 26 now. I've spent the last decade of my life revolving around weed.

I've been trying to quit for multiple years now but with weed being engrained in my brain from such a young age it's like my brain always defaults back to what it knows, smoking weed. 

The longest I've been without weed is 6 weeks in the last 8 years, but to be fair I've participated in sober October for the last 3-4 years. 

I tell myself that I can quit whenever I want but the amount of times I've told the people around me I'm quitting only to pick up a joint again says otherwise.

Reading into some of the issues with adolescent marijuana use I know that my dopamine system is all out of wack and my pre frontal cortex is developed differently versus non smokers. At this point I've created a huge dependency on weed in my life.

I'm not going to let that stop me tho, I was looking for a sign to quit for good and I found one yesterday, it was 2/2/22. Dates like that don't come around often so I'm going to use it as an excuse to change my life forever.

My birthday is today so I thought, “I could smoke with my roommates” last night and have a good time, I don’t need to be so strict towards myself. I smoked and was filled with immediate regret as I could feel my anxiety come full force into my mind, I did what I could to fight back but it really took away from my night and time with people I care about. 
Also sucks because the last time I got high was a truly transcendent experience to leave off of. So, not being mad at myself, but do have regret. 
Still, gonna make this a great day!",6

I wanted to share my experience because the women posting their experiences on this sub really helped assuage my frantic nerves while I was withdrawing.

Some background: I'm 33, overweight, and had been smoking almost every day for 7 years.

I had basically a clean break with 3 minor relapses around the holidays (one or two hits from a vape pen at parties.)

My periods were insane for 6 months. The effects of weed and withdrawal on menstruation are not well documented or medically studied, so I was basically flying blind, like many of you.

For the first month I was very sweaty, irritable, and I had the lightest, longest period of my life. That happened two months in a row.

The third month I lightly bled for 27 days straight and then had the heaviest, scariest period of my life.

After that things seem to be essentially back to normal. I am bleeding a little longer than pre-weed, but I know my body well enough to know that it's still re-adjusting.

I also experienced an insane amount of bloating that seems to be finally dissipating.

Weed impacts your estrogen levels, thyroid, progesterone levels. It makes sense that using heavily and then stopping would have some unpleasant ramifications.

It's worth it though. Hang in there, and have a little grace with yourself.",201

I got in with the wrong crowd in 9th grade and have smoked pretty much daily ever since. I'm 25 now and have secured a good job after graduating university and I think it's time to leave my habit behind me.

The only break I've taken was this past summer for about a month until I relapsed after getting sick and convincing myself that I would only smoke through the sickness to make it more bearable.

Anyways, the last break I experienced extreme nausea in the morning for about a week or so. At the time I had no idea there was medical terminology for the condition. It was a lot easier to deal with then because I wasn't working full time and could veg out at home. Now I'm trying to deal with it while continuing my usual schedule of exercising before work in the morning, which is proving to be pretty difficult as I'm puking water into the garbage in between each set of weight training lol.

Does anyone know of any remedies for CHS? Anything I can do to alleviate the nausea, or just ""push through the consequences of my dumb decisions"" like my lifting coach says. Honestly, if it's the latter, I don't mind too much. I'll think of it as penance for my sins haha.

**TL;DR:** Does anyone know of any remedies for CHS induced nausea or do I just push through until it passes?",7

Narcissistic overly controlling verbally and emotionally abusive parents, my first serious relationship became very abusive and I put up with way to much. I was in an environment where I couldn't be myself. I wasn't allowed to peruse my passions at all as a teen. Simply not allowed. I drew all the time as a teenager but my mom would just constantly take my sketchbooks, and that is just a small grain of salt compared to the shit I had to endure. I had no door in my room. I was slugged in the shoulder at 9 years old by my dad on Christmas eve for no real reason other than he was just mad at everything for nothing. My parents fought all the time. Inside of the house was torn apart and left for renovations for my whole life. There was a hole in the wall and in the winter snow a few snowflakes could come into the house. We had to wear jackets in the winter inside and and really cold days I could see my breath.

I grew up in Canada. We have some cold winters. 

 Child Protective Services would have condemned that house and had me taken away if they found out how dangerous and unfit that place was for a kid. 

All that trauma lead to me smoking weed in my 20s. 

10 fucking wasted years of smoking the world away because I felt like there was nothing else. I was dead inside. I sort of got away from most of my abuse, but the trauma remains. 

No more. No. Fucking. More. 

I'm not going to let anything else win. I can't fucking do this anymore. I want to feel happy and alive again. I want to lucid dream again like I was so able to so easily before all this. I've gone from smoking 5 joints a day to just two small bong bowls. 

  
Today I'm going to do my first 24 hours in prob three years. And I plan with all my heart to make it to 48. 

  
Therapy is next.

Someone asks why weed is suddenly making them so anxious they want to crawl out of their skin - and no, it's not because it's sativa. Most common response is something to the effect of some subconcious issue that they need to deal with before they can smoke weed again.

It just doesn't work like that for me. I can be in the perfect set and setting, alone in bed after a great evening or in the company of my closest friends playing video games - if I smoke weed, I suddenly find myself overcome by insecurity, teetering the edge of a panic attack.

I went through a pretty rough depression patch couple years back and was self-medicating with weed despite the fact it didn't improve anything, and smoking weed feels like hopping in a time capsule to those times.

Turns out the ""subconcious thing I need to deal with"" is the fact that weed just kind of does this to me now. There's a bitterness in having to give up something that used to be a source of joy, but it's necessary for today's joy.",16

I hope you all are doing well and keep going on your way! 

I'm new to this Section and just wanted to tell you my story. Maybe it will help someone to stay on their own path.
I began to smoke weed in school back when I was about 16 and since then it was a big part of my life. It was kinda a lifestyle and since we all getting older and not younger I started to realize that Life has so much more to offer than just chilling with your homies or alone and getting high. In the last two years I smoked nearly everyday (there were only a handful of Days it didn't smoked) and of course my tolerance began to raise and raise and I also started to spend more and more money on big amounts of weed at the beginning of the month. Then I got my first girlfriend with 21 years old,  which I loved from my deepest heart and decided to quit smoking (for her but I also knew she got a point - especially for a future with children and a healthy lifestyle). In this time I started to smoke more cigarettes instead of weed. (Addiction shift). After nearly 8 months of the relationship she just said she lost feelings and is no longer interested. That broke my heart because I really tried so hard and gave her all of my love, time, attention and putted so much effort into this person - just to be ghosted at the end and be left with a broken heart. Of course I immediately started again to smoke weed after that happened, since I was really sad and depressed. Since then I regularly smoked two grams (alone) per day or more when I was with friends. 
Now I'm three days and four hours sober! I know that's not long but hey, everyone has to start somewhere I guess. The first day it was really really rough and I struggled so hard just to have my ritual (smoking on my balcony before sleep) and also craved the taste. I know it's a very hard and also long process and I'm just at the start of it, but I'm feeling like I'm making progress and I'm also kinda proud - and you guys should be also proud! For every single step you doing. It's the right decision. I no longer crave the taste or even want to think about getting high again for the moment. The next big step would be to quit nicotine also but first I guess I'm going to concentrate on the weed part. 

I'm now struggling with heavy sleeping disorder and also night sweats. That's sucks but I know when I keep going it will get better and better (hopefully). I just want to fall asleep peacefully without even have to think about smoking a fat Doobie. (Even when I smoked one or even four by myself before sleeping, I was struggling to fall asleep - that's also one of many many reasons I want to quit so bad - I guess the weed messed up more than I have thought while smoking..)

Maybe some of you guys got great Ideas what I can do  in my freetime or how I can sleep better? I now started again to play Minecraft (haha yes, Minecraft) and to do little workouts at home. I want to try out new things and discover the clean and brighter side of the life. So I would appreciate any tips or tricks for staying on the right path and staying sober. 

Have a wonderful day and rest of the week and thanks for advance for reading so far! :-) 

Much love and stay clean and healthy.",1

The journey to this 1 sober day by choice has been gruesome and mostly self inflicted.

What’s harder, making the decision to quit or the process of actually quitting.

So talking to myself but not saying anything out loud and once I realized that my head was starting to hurt from how dizzy my thoughts made me, i would stop myself. Quite literally snap my fingers to snap myself out of this trance of negative self talk and pessimistic outlook on life. 

I used the 5-4-3-2-1 method which helped, the 5 senses and in order to make it to the gym i counted down from 5 and out loud told myself “GO GO GO” 😂

It sounds funny and odd like I’m treating myself like a child but quite frankly I feel that way. Like I’m being reborn into my new lifestyle and it’s going to be baby talk for a bit and I’m okay with this.

I think I am what people call a high functioning person with depression fueled by ADHD and CPTSD. I have extreme downs, and relatively balanced mid-level functioning when things are ok. I stopped smoking weed back at the end of November, and while I’ve been able to keep up with not smoking (not without days of really intense cravings), I’m starting to drink a little more, eat my emotions, and can feel myself being pulled down into a deep depression riddled with grief, traumatic memories, and a blindness to seeing myself in the future. It’s a dangerous space to be in, because I’m hanging on to hope, but it’s running out. 

For those of you who have been here but have crawled out, how did you do it? I’m living in a city where I know no one, can’t maintain relationships, business is stressful, I’m constantly worried about money, and I am afraid to leave my house. I need help.

Right before the lapse I was anxious, felt bleak, and couldn't really make myself not feel that way.  I was offered to toke as they saw my distress and while I hesitated, I caved.

I knew they were there but I could shut the blinds over them and not have to look at them anymore as I did when I was sober. I still had the same problems as before, they just camped out my front door only to come knocking when I awoke. 

I probably would have woken up feeling a little bit better today if I hadn't used. As when you sleep with thc in your system at night the brain isn't able to ""defragment"" properly (as I would have had my REM sleep if I hadn't used).  Instead of feeling better, I've been feeling irritable and unsure about how to deal with my problem. Things are so much clearer when you're not in the muck of being high or withdrawing. I wish I had refused the offer to use and just sat in the discomfort while allowing myself to feel how I felt. I hope you all can maybe take something away from this and if not, you probably know already what I mean.

2022-02-02 19:28:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sj4s19/on_importance_of_environmental_cues_celebrating/,On importance of environmental cues & celebrating our wins,"A good friend came to stay with me for a little while because they were going through something super hard, and I bought em a plane ticket to visit me and have a bit of a reset. I knew they smoked weed, but for whatever reason it hasn't occurred to me that the tough time they've been having could lead to an increase in use. I had talked to them several times about the fact that I've quit weed. Repeatedly, they've been one of the many folks I've known that even casually mentioning I've quit weed without pressing the matter means they quickly jump to defend their use and consider it their ""medicine"". Fine enough, you do you. And so, of course, one of the first things they asked me after getting in my car after their flight got in was ""do you have any weed?"" Within a few hours there we were, at a pot shop, and they snapped up a ton of weed. I've been off the pot train for close to 6 months now... surprisingly it wasn't tempting in the least bit. 

Cue their smoking 8-10 spliffs smoked a day, every day they were here. Cue that one night where I was so stressed out from them being so stressed out, I took a few drags of one and instantly regretted it. Cue me instantly being angry at them for knowing I quit and still offering it anyway (I totally recognize it's not their job to police me, just sharing the feeling I had in the moment). Cue me realizing on a fundamental level just how important environmental cues and social circles are for kicking an addiction. 

The next day - after a night of no sleep from the anxiety & guilt of having smoked - I had a moment of clarity: I realized that it hasn't just been the weed I've kicked - it's the whole environmental ecosystem of things I had kicked that were holding me to my weed use...and sadly, that friend was a big one. I left the house/town we share in common because I was miserable there, and smoking weed to get by. The community I was a part of was deep in weed land and most were addicted to drug use of some kind. I broke off a ton of friendships from there that were making me so overwhelmed I felt like I needed to smoke. I realized I was using weed to avoid pain & trauma and then getting myself into traumatic situations through using it. So often weed use isn't just weed use. It's a bandaid for a whole constellation of things we're trying to get away from. At least, it seems that way for so many damn people I've known.

So yeah, am I bummed I caved and took a few puffs? Yes. But, the whole experience of that and my friend being here was a wild reflection and made me appreciate how far I've come (even though I feel for them still being so deeply in the thick of it). I've really come to recognize how addiction was thriving in many of its forms in my life and have been working hard on rooting out the source of it all through meditation, art, and therapy. I've been working out, have new friends and have an amazing partner who quit at the same time as me. I honestly never thought I'd get as far as I have after 10 years of near constant weed use and I'm really proud of myself, even if I stumbled once. I'm glad I instantly regretted it and had a crappy experience to remind me of how much I have to lose if I ever went back to it. It also made me realize how important it is to celebrate how far we've come! I hope you've been celebrating every month that goes by (or week, or day!) because you're friggin worth it. 

So if you've got this far and you've been feeling tempted: just don't do it. It's not worth it, and it's even more anxiety-inducing then you remember ;)  Take from this bone head. You got this.",8

I'm not gonna lie, weed was on my mind the whole day. I'm an evening smoker, so knowing I wouldn't be able to smoke tonight was taxing. But(!) I recently got hooked on Ozark, so I definitely had something to look forward to to do at night! 
I also cooked proper dinner instead of eating the first thing I could find that didn't require any effort. I also know myself (from instances where I ran out of weed before) and I know that usually I would resort to drinking a couple of beers. Anything to not be 100% me - if that makes sense. So since my MIL drinks non alcoholic beer we had some in the house for when she comes around. I had one - to keep the ""after work ritual"" but not altering my state of mind. I enjoyed the ritual, but man is non alcoholic beer sweet. I like very bitter and hoppy beers, so my next mission will be to find a non alcoholic beer that actually tastes good and doesn't have that sweet aftertaste.
I'm not going 100% sober, I still enjoy my wine and my beer but I'm hell bent on not using alcohol as a weed substitute.
So that's it. I surprisingly don't mind not being high but I resent my mind for thinking constantly about weed. I really hope that I Will be able to get to the point where I don't constantly think about the absence of weed.

Edit to add: I know everybody says that their ""dreams came back"" and that they ""are super vivid"". thing is I never stopped dreaming. I already dreamt vividly nearly every day. Meaning sometimes I would wake up upset not knowing why until I remembered a bad dream I had. Or I would straight up cry in dreams and wake up sobbing. Well, today I dreamt and it was a few dreams (normally just one or two) supervivid (maybe more than normal?) and super absurd (as always). If it gets more vivid and intense I'm gonna need a nap to recover from sleeping tbh.",2

And I've been feeling really good all day.

 I don't know if it'll stick yet, but chosing to not smoke all day and getting through that is a big accomplishment for me. Right around now is when I would normally light up, but I'm having a good sandwich, vaping a little instead (my next challenge ahead), and sitting down with some Wolfenstein to distract me for the night. And I feel good. Don't know if I can make it tomorrow, or the next day, but I'll be so proud of myself if I make it until I go to sleep with no weed.

A friend that I've known since I was 12 died recently, suddenly and without any warning whatsoever. At his eulogy, I listened as many good things were said about his life and his activities. I wondered what would be said about me at such an affair.

Every conversation I have lately seems to be a direct assault on my self-esteem. After the funeral I talked with several people, no less than 3 people had told me they had written a book. I heard about PhD's gained and international trips taken. Six-figure jobs being landed, promotions, sabbaticals, the usual pretentious shit.

I'm 44 and I have nothing to show for my life. I feel like I used to be proud of myself and just being happy with what I've done was enough, considering the fucked up childhood I endured. I used to do it all while getting high and enjoying myself.

I've been sober for about a year now, and I've kept my experience hidden from everyone. The longer I've been away the more I feel I need to put my struggles into words for my own closure. 

I started smoking flower when I was 24 years old. I got into it to supplement my drinking which was getting out of control. I didn't like the person I was when I was drunk, and I hurt some people close to me. Weed seemed like a good option to me at the time. My first 6-8 months with weed were pretty uneventful. I smoke morning, afternoon, and night pretty much everyday. But I lived alone, was single, and didn't really see any significant difference in my life. 

At 25 I got my med card and discovered concentrates. This is where things started going downhill for me. I instantly got hooked on the feeling. It was stronger and cleaner than the flower. It made me not care about anything going on in my life. I started to devour concentrates every chance I could. I smoked as soon as I woke up, right before I left for work, on my lunch break, I'd leave work regularly to smoke and go back, I'd smoke the second I got home, and pretty much every hour until I passed out. Usually I'd wake up around 2am and smoke just to pass out instantly again. A gram would barely last me a full 24 hours. I would go to the dispensary 4-5 times a week and buy more and more. When my paycheck dwindled, I opened a credit card...and then another. 

Being high also made me obsessed with buying things. I always had something in my head that I was going to do. I'd be a mountain biker and buy everything I needed for it. I'd be a backpacker and camper, and buy everything I needed. I'd do photography and spend a thousand dollars on gear. But I never used any of the stuff. I just got high. Eventually I just couldn't manage anymore debt and I was forced to reel in the amount I was smoking, but I still did it as much as I could afford to, which allowed me to be high the entire day. I continued this for 4 years until I was 29.

At 29 I found someone to love me, and started a committed relationship. I never told her I smoked, and hid it from her for as long as I possibly could. We moved in together after only dating for 8 months, and I would make excuses to leave so I could go to my old apartment to smoke. I was also leaving work more during the day to smoke in peace at my old apartment. Eventually she caught on and called me out for being stoned. I promised her I would quit, and actually got rid of my old apartment so I couldn't sneak off. At this point I discovered the magic of edibles. 

They were perfect. I could take them right under people's noses and they couldn't smell it, they didn't require pipes or heat or anything special. They also didn't completely wreck me like concentrates did. I started buying 10mg capsules, and I ate them like candy all day long. I typically did 4 in the morning when I woke up, 2-4 throughout my day at work, 2-4 on my way home, and 4 around dinner time before I went to bed. I loved the way they made me feel. They made me feel normal. And any time I'd start to sober up my brain would hit panic mode until I popped a few capsules and got back to feeling normal. My girlfriend would question me from time to time because she thought I was acting weird, but I'd play it off as being tired or stress from my job. She never caught on. 

I continued religiously taking edibles until I was 33 years old. Around this time I really started to hate myself. I hated being high, I hated being in debt, I hated hiding everything from my girlfriend who loves me unconditionally. I felt so guilty about everything and really just couldn't stand looking in the mirror anymore. My life felt like I was doing everything on hard mode. My brain was foggy, I was always tired, I completely lost my morals and who I was as a person in weed. I tried to quit many times but had a ton of failed attempts. I had been hiding everything for so long that I never felt I could reach out and talk to anyone for help. I realized it was completely up to me to make a change because nobody could do it for me. I set a goal to go one month sober. I forced myself to make it. After feeling awful for weeks something clicked in me. I felt incredible. My mind was clear, my thoughts were happy, I had energy I haven't felt in years. I cut up my med card before I even made it to a month sober and never looked back. Everything in my life is better now. I can look in the mirror and smile at myself. I can be a person I'm happy to be. I'm not hiding anything from anyone. I'm working hard to pay off my debt and recover from my past mistakes. But everything feels so good now. This is the first time I've ever admitted my true relationship with weed to anyone. I appreciate you all for listening.",149
2022-02-02 16:25:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sj0d6d/108_days_clean_journal_entry/,108 days clean - journal entry,"I just wrote something in my journal, and I thought it may be helpful to some of you guys over here. I've drawn strength from your posts, and I hope you can draw some strength from mine.

\----

True relaxation can only occur in the absence of anxiety. And I am experiencing absolutely no anxiety right now. Zero. Nothing. No anxiety. No nervous tick. No unscratchable itch. Nothing. Nothing at all. Contentment? Maybe not complete contentment, but, something close to that. Sure there are many little things bothering me if I had to go and look for them, but I don't have the grinding urge to find the itch.

This is the difference between being a stoner and not being a stoner. Or being stoned and not being stoned. Being stoned, or hooked on weed, means there's always something niggling in the back of my mind. There's a feeling of a little bit of anxiety. Some discomfort, in my heart, some emptiness, a vacancy. Or in my stomach, some butterflies or something.. hollowness.. emptiness. And then, because I am feeling that in my body, I am trying to figure out where that is coming from. And my mind will go searching and searching. And of course, if you're looking for something you will find it. If you feel discomfort, and you rummage through your store of worries, anxieties and concerns, of course, you will always find something. There will always be something to worry about, or to be anxious about. But. Right now, I don't have that physical feeling anywhere in my body. I have nothing within me that warrants me to go digging through my stuffed drawers of worries.. of things that I could possibly be worried about.

In the absence of worry and discomfort, there comes the space, the opportunity for new things. Creativity. Excitement. Optimism. It is not possible to be optimistic when there is a constant background noise of negativity or anxiety floating around. To be creative means to try new things. And trying new things is very difficult if you're afraid of everything around you. But with no smoking of weed, and the complete absence of all anxiety and worry, there is all of a sudden some space for things other than that. Even space for nothing. Stillness, emptiness, vacancy. Space for space itself. And within that stillness and space, lies the opportunity. For new things to be. 

If this had been any other time in my life, I would have been incredibly anxious right now. I'm without a job basically (in stoner speak). More healthily I can now clearly tell myself that I am in-between projects (and actually believe it, and be comfortable with it). And I can say that, and sit without that feeling that I am being chased by some ghost or other, or having this self-imposed artificial urgency hanging over my head, I have the time and space now to be truly creative. To do things that are completely devoid of any fear at all. I can be truly creative.

The freedom to be creative was, thus, not to be found in a fat bank balance, it was to be found in putting out the burning joint that had been hanging from my fingers for the last 25 years.",27

I finally feel safe in my own house.,"One reason for me to quit is to be less paranoid. Approximately a year ago I had a scary encounter with one of my neighbors. On this night this person kept banging on my door, to the point I had to call the police. Exactly one week later I heard the doorbell and knocking, again. I called the police again, but my neighbor said I was exaggerating. It was a terrible experience. After that day I became paranoid, and smoking did not help at all. Everyday I could hear their voice. The hallway, the balcony, every person that looked like them made my heart race. The doorbell made me freeze and make me drop all my activities. Even in my nightmares my fear was noticeable.

Luckily it's safe to say things are better. The voices are gone. I don't have to go out of bed multiple times to check if I really locked my door. I can walk through the hallway without being scared I will see them. My heart still jumps a little bit when I hear the doorbell, but I am finally able to answer the door. The dreams still suck, especially since I'm quitting. But I try not to let it get to me. It's my mind finally processing what has happened. I feel relieved. It took a whole year, but I can finally call my house home again. I feel safe.

Let's hope I don't have to hear those voices ever again. A home has been the greatest gift since I quit. It's difficult, but I can't give up on myself now.",9

I replaced weed with caring for myself in so many other ways. Caring about myself. Truly caring that I make choices that feel right.

Also you can do it your way! My partner is still a daily user. Although it was hard at first it has made the temptation to smoke in social situations very easy. It’s easy to say no to friends when I say no to the weed that’s on my counter everyday. When I asked for advice on here about living with a partner that still smokes so many told me to leave him. If you’re in a similar situation remember you’re the one with the problem, and only you can fix it. Even if I’d ended my relationship I’d still be faced with temptation from friends, coworkers, and my family. Do what’s right for you! 

Most importantly! It’s easier than you think! The first month was awful and painful. I had terrible acne and I was grinding my teeth every night (and still do sometimes). It’s your body telling you how much you depended on weed to relax you, and you’re gonna need to find another way to deal. In this journey I found yoga, meditation, the sauna🥰 so many new things I may have never tried had I not quit! The only way to break a habit is to replace it with a positive new habit. 

This is a life long journey. I know there will be days when I want to smoke again, and I won’t be this positive. But everyday I try to find new tools or sharpen the ones I have to stay strong!

I've hardly ever posted here, wasn't quite sure I belonged here. For me alcohol was always my main demon, I drank every day for 25 years. 10 years clean from that now with zero mistakes over that 10 years.

Cannabis, though ... it's never been obvious that I needed to quit. No perceptible problems, no complaints from family or coworkers, no money problems.  Lately I'd been toking morning, noon, and night. It seemed to me it was at worst innocuous and at best it helped make me a better person, more relaxed, better sex, more fun.

But my main identity over recent years has changed because of my meditation practices. I meditate for hours every day.  Trips to the ashram occupy most of my vacation time.  Nearly all my friends are in this meditative life.  And I'm successful and accomplished at it.  All the bliss and happiness I can imagine come to me through meditation, every day. I run a meditation group locally where I am a teacher and mentor and example of the life transformation that meditation can bring.

Except for weed I live a clean life, no alcohol, no meat, plant-based diet, very little anger and negativity in my life.

But man, I still enjoyed cannabis.

Can I ever really be a pure example of the bliss-saturated yogi who's totally unshaken by life, who's every step is guided by something divine, and still use cannabis?

Well I know what the rastafarians would say. And I know my guru would say no, absolutely not, the drug is inevitably a distraction and hindrance to furthering your life.

But man, I still enjoyed cannabis.

So I've been undecided on quitting for a while. Oh I know I'll probably quit daily all-day usage at some point.  But today? Really? Do I have to?

&#x200B;

**Why I quit:**

I started a 42-day devotional yoga program on the last full moon, 16 days ago.  Daily practices, and also some rules including ""no alcohol, no meat."" No problem, I gave those up years ago.  But perhaps I should give up weed also, as a sign that I'm serious here.  As an experiment.

So I quit, 16 days ago, from daily all-day usage to zero.  Just raw-dogging reality, as my stoner friends would say.

How has it been? Awesome!  Meditation practices are deeper. I feel more subtle shifts in my energy that were a bit covered over when I was always high.

But man, I still love cannabis.  That stoner voice in my head still speaks up every day. ""Go ahead man, you're alone in your home office all day. You got all your meditation practices done for the day. Who's going to know? The weed is right over there on the counter.""

So I close my eyes and feel the bliss of connection to the universal divine.  And the stoner voice shuts up.

But it will be back.",3
2022-02-02 11:18:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sism1x/day_1_again/,Day 1. Again.,"I have been trying to quit, in earnest, for a few months now. I recently started down a path of a new career in which I will not be able to use cannabis, which was the catalyst for this decision. I had my first real break from cannabis recently since starting to use it regularly about 7 years ago. I was able to stay away from it for about 6 weeks, and I felt so light and free. I felt quicker, mentally, and funnier. I felt more focused. I felt more desire to make friends and interact with people in general. I almost forgot who I was before cannabis - he was a really interesting guy with more actual, perceived, and aspirational value than I have now. This was far and away the longest I had intentionally abstained and I think I  was proud and had convinced myself that I could just do it again.

I can. But it’s much harder to start being sober than it is to keep being sober, I am discovering.

I relapsed a couple weeks ago. I was drunk at the time, which I’m sure had something to do with it, but I have smoked plenty of times since then without any liquid influence.

I have completely reverted to who I was when I smoked every day. I get out less. I meet fewer (no) people. I get less done. I feel less good about myself.

The purpose of this post, really, is just to hold myself accountable. To be able to look back and remind myself how I felt in this moment and why I need to stop again and stop for good. Thank you so much for the support found in this community. I feel awake again.",5

My relationship with my boyfriend seems to be getting harder. arguments, both of us feeling like we lost something, just two depressed gay idiots that get high a lot lmao. 

For the last 4 months life hit me with really bad anxiety, depression, but like the physical symptoms which I never faced before, hardest four months of my life. I was unsure if it was the weed that had done this to me, but I sure know this not helping now. 

After a few therapy sessions that I'll keep going to, I decided to quit and my partner is with me and we are going to try our best to work on our selves and improve our lives. 

Im tired of being dependent on weed to enjoy my self, it's caused me health issues, and really bad mentality too. I smoke every day (2-4 joints with tabacoo every day.) I don't think it's a lot so maybe it's not so hard to kick the habit.  

I want to make a change to be a better me. Thanks for reading that, I have a question, I smoke cigarettes, so I'm worried that as a rebound I'll just start smoking 10x more. 

Do I quit both together? Start vaping with low nicotine? Any advice please? 

Also, is it advised to never touch weed again or are people able to use it in moderation without facing all the mental effects weed does like long term memory loss and brain fog. Maybe one night every 2 weeks or so. Would the habit be picked up instantly?

Would love some encouragement please, I sure need it 😅

Last night while falling asleep, I realized I just can’t do it anymore, I’m mentally fucked and my chest feels sore and raw. I got right out of bed and gave my mom all my weed and paraphernalia, which is a big step for me because I’ve never done anything like that before. I’ve always said I’ll stop once I just go through the rest of what I have, yk the deal…and then end up desperately scraping up shake and kief once its gone, or putting a lighter to my cart, or just flat out buying more. But this time I said no, this needs to stop now, and I actually did something about it. My friends also asked to smoke with me today and I said no!! I’m proud of myself because I’ve never had this kind of self control, and hopefully I can look back on my actions and it will help me to remember how important it was to me that I stop. I remember reading posts where people said they got rid of the rest of their weed and thought, that could never be me. but it is today :) 

I’ve been on this sub for like a year and a half, and haven’t managed to fully quit yet. The longest I made it was like 1.5 months. But after going back it’s even more clear I don’t need weed. It prevents me from accomplishing every single goal that I have. I can relax on my own, I can think deeply on my own, I can enjoy food and music and everything else on my own, I don’t need a drug. I want to be happy. I can have a good time with my friends without it. I don’t need it and I never, ever will. 

I’m posting this a day later, and last night was rough. I cried a lot during the day, felt very empty inside, and I tossed and turned all night. I basically had to force feed myself all day. I barely got any sleep, and I was so tempted to sneak into my moms room and grab some but I know what would happen. Even if it doesn’t spiral into frivolous use, it will continue to alter my brain chemistry and make it hard to function. 

Anyway, good luck friends, I hope everyone is doing well, I’m excited for life. I already feel better, even though I feel bad. I’m doing this for real this time.",6

What a journey..

I know that I am an addict, and I know I have the strength to quit, but I seem to always end up thinking ""now that I have been sober for X amount of time, I can start again but responsibly. Of course that always happens in a moment of weakness, when I'm feeling down about some aspects of my life, when I don't feel creative enough, when something bad happens. And also it's a big mistake because the word responsibly just doesn't exist anymore once I start again.

At the moment I am lazy as fuck, I have a lot of emails I just left on the side, things to deal with that I just forgot about, my organisation skills are back to when I was smoking everyday. And I have a one month break off university so no real schedule to make me do things.

A week ago I went on a ""retreat"" trip by myself in the middle of a forest, it was awesome and I planned to quit during that time (less pressure, going for walks everyday, etc..)

I am now just about 4 days sober and I feel like shit but I know it's the right thing to do and I'llget through it. I'm reaching out to you because I am ashamed of this addiction so no-one in my surroundings knows how bad I feel when I smoke, or how much of a struggle addiction is..

I caved last night on day 15 because life has been throwing me too many lemons during my quest to get clean. With all the things suddenly going on for me I kinda knew that first attempt wasn’t going to be the successful one, and after 2 weeks of trying to deal with all of this with the withdrawals and shit that comes with quitting, it was just too much and I wanted to let it all go and literally blow it out the window. 

I smoked one joint last night and it has put me straight back on the path to staying clean. I did not enjoy it. At first, the first few tokes was like a relief, but before the joint was even finished my head felt really tight, and all the doom and anxiety of the world was back and I spun out for the rest of the evening with anxieties about pretty much everything. I looked at my partner and said “I don’t want to do this anymore”, put the rest of the J down, and that’s it. I am done. 

I didn’t think I was feeling much better over those 15 days, time was passing so slowly, my mind was a shitty place to be - but last night I saw just how slow but real the progress I’d been making actually was. And I can’t believe I had spent such a long amount of my life in that other, altered state. It really put into perspective just how much it was negatively affecting me without me realising it. 

So yes, this is a long slow journey. But every day some progress is made. I prefer feeling cleaner in my mind and body, and I realised just how much calmer my mind and anxiety etc was, how easy it’s been to wake up in the mornings, how insatiably hungry the munchies had been making me, how much better I had been and felt those past 2 weeks even if it was boring and a bit shitty - it’s better than smoking and will continue to improve.

I posted on here a long time ago and had given quitting weed a try after a new career opportunity presented itself. Needless to say, my sobriety then didn't last long. 

5 months ago my father passed away suddenly from a massive stroke. My mother who had been battling brain cancer for 2 years passed away on new years day this year. I knew that weed would not help me through this, but it was my ONLY way of coping. My habit continued and I was spending even more money at the dispensary, missing days at work, and just generally not allowing myself to properly grieve.

Call it a midlife crisis (or maybe a quarter life crisis), but 9 days ago I decided enough was enough and got rid of everything. My bong, all my weed, my carts, and my beloved vape pen. I decided that I wanted a better life, and weed has been the only thing preventing me from doing so. For privacy reasons I wont state what the career is, but I will say that marijuana use does NOT go hand in hand with it. But I decided that before I turn 30, I want to be able to be proud of myself for the first time ever. 

The first few days sucked, but my motivation kept me going. I gave my carts to some co workers and gave my bud to a relative. Days 1 and 2 were mostly boring and I found it really hard to sleep. Day 3 I was cranky as hell at work and avoided people as much as possible. After day 3 things became a lot easier but the cravings started to hit. I learned that leaving the situation where the craving was helped a lot, like going into another room or taking a short walk. I've also been drinking a ton of water, not sure if it's helped with the cravings but it makes me feel like I'm flushing out the THC from my system (I do have to take a urine test for the new job). Just for shits and giggles I took a saliva drug test and passed which was a giant morale booster. Every time a craving hits and I think about smoking weed, I stop myself because I'm already in deep with quitting and starting over from day 1 is just not worth the high.

I wanted to make this post for a couple of reasons. For accountability and to remind myself that I'm not alone through this journey, and hopefully to encourage others in the same boat trying to quit. It's tough, emotions run wild, but its 100% possible. I'm hoping my next post on here will be to tell you all that I passed my drug test. 

Good luck to every one of you.",4
2022-02-02 04:47:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sikqua/recently_quit_weed_and_hashish_when_will_my_body/,Recently quit weed and hashish. When will my body stop feeling like shit?,"Tldr: Smoked for a decade, last two months were extreme consumption wise. Finally stopped and still feeling hazy and not fully sober almost a week later. Also not feeling great physically. 

(Also if you want to quit and find this post, don’t get scared. I have zero regrets and do not want to go back. Life is better now. But, I still want to manage the withdrawal properly.) 

Heya everyone. So for the past decade I’ve been a weed addict. Like full on, couldn’t sleep without it, would get unbearable and bitchy when sober, the whole deal. Y’all know what it’s like. I’m 27 now so you can imagine what that means. Spent my entire late teenage years and early adulthood high as a kite.

Well, the past two months have been particularly extreme. I’d say since the pandemic hit my consumption skyrocketed. Last summer my ex left me which left me stranded in life due her being my only living situation available. Again, exacerbating my consumption. Since then I was forced to live with my piece of shit mother and her disgusting boyfriend. This only compounded my excessive consumption until it reached a peak two months ago. I reached a level where I would continue to smoke even when my body was physically sick from all the THC in my body. I’d wake in the middle of the night cause the sleep sobered me up and would
smoke before I went to pee or drink a coffee in the morning. 

I tried to calculate it… I bought 60g of very potent hashish (I’m from Germany) around January 1st and had it all smoked up by January 24th. 20g per week or a lil less than 3g a day. I know I know people might do more or point to some Wiz Khalifa but to me that’s an extreme level of consumption. However it was the only way I knew how to cope with the extremely extremely mentally brutalizing situation I was in. Essentially I was never sober, which was the goal.

After a total breakdown I finally managed to escape the gruesome situation. On January 24th I bought a gram of regular weed, splitting it into 5 parts to have one nightly joint. Friday the 28th, so last week, I had my final joint.

Since then I haven’t so much as touched weed. However my body simply refuses to feel better. I have stomach cramps and my head continues to feel foggy. When I wake up I feel like I smoked the night before which I obviously didn’t.

Further context: 
-	In Germany we do joints with tobacco to make the hashish or weed more potent. 
-	I continue to smoke cigarettes as laying those off is too much at the moment.
-	I try to move a lot, get a lot of fresh air and eat healthy. I also continue to work regularly. So it’s not like I’m curled up in some dark room. 

Is this normal? I feel like I’m still not truly sober. Like there is that slight haze still left. When will it get better? Or did I just fuck my brain up for good? Did I just hurt my body more than I thought? Do I need physical therapy? I know this post is long winded but I purposely wanted to provide as much detail as possible. For years I wanted to stop. Finally, FINALLY I’m there and now I feel like I’m going insane from not feeling that much better.

Another idea could be that now a lot of things I simply numbed out are resurfacing. Physical issues I simply ignored and didn’t feel when high. I don’t know. I really hope someone bothers to read this and has some freaking idea what the hell is going on. I heard THC stays in your system for a while so I’m hoping it’s just that. But then again I already SEVERELY reduced my consumption last week before the full stop on Friday.

Sometimes I miss the feeling of passing and being passed a joint. 

I don't want it to consume me like it used to. Where I would smoke 6 joints a day without hesitation.

But I daydream about the occasional joint but it also scares me cause I know how paranoid I get and how much the shit we smoke here in my country is laced.

I had vivid dreams, migraines, mode swings and basically hard time coping with “bad” news. Oh yeah, and a shit load of anxiety and a “weird” feeling in general. 
At first i couldn’t leave the house except for working out/ doctor appointments. Every social experience seemed like an impossible mission. It got better and i did even manage to work from the office a couple of times (feeling anxiety 80% of the time) but only when it was mostly empty. 
I was a daily smoker, and it’s important to say that the reason i stopped smoking was due to the the weed causing me mild anxiety when smoking, last few months.
A week or two after i quitted - it skyrocketed.
I eat better, sleep better, workout couple of times a week (need to improve on that) and basically built a new routine as this seemed life changing. 
Not sure how long will this last and what should be my next steps.
I’m an optimistic person and would really love to hear others experiences throughout their journey.

I want to be present for my future kid. But I honestly don't know how to quit. Any help appreciated.,"I've been smoking since I was 17. I had a really rough childhood, including sexual and physical abuse. I ran away to escape it as a teenager. I knew I needed depression meds, but I couldn't legally get a prescription until I was 18. My friend offered me some weed in the meantime, and I've been smoking ever since. 

It was really fun when I was young. We would sit out on my friends porch at night, wrapped up in blankets to stay warm, smoking and talking until it got too cold to stay out any longer.  Smoking used to be an event. An escape. A moment of clarity in a complicated life. But I've had to recognize in recent years that it's not a past time anymore, it's a crutch. 

I still smoke daily, but I've cut way down. I used to smoke 5 large bowls a day, and I'm down to one small one in the evenings. But it's not an event anymore. It's not really fun. I honestly don't notice being high anymore, except when I'm not high, I'm thinking about wanting to get high. My short term memory is absolutely shot. I can't keep track of anything I own, and I know it's at least partially the weed. I don't have a lot of motivation or energy either. I'm not sure how much is pot related, but I'm sure it doesn't help. I've gotten to a point in my mental health where I can recognize the weed is holding me back, but I've never had the motivation to quit before. 

Lately I've been thinking about the future, and I really want to be a father some day. I have a lot of work to do on my life before then. I really want to be the parent I needed as a kid. I know I won't be perfect, but I want to do all I can. I've been trying to motivate myself by picturing the kind of father I want to be, and I don't want to be this forgetful and emotionally checked out. I want to quit. But I honestly don't know how to live without weed. 

I haven't been 100% sober for more then a week at a time in my entire adult life. Smoking is as integral to my life as breathing. I really don't feel like there is a lot of support out there for quitting pot. Everyone is always like: ""You can't get addicted to weed!!!1! Pot smoking is FINE! It's good for your health!!1!1"" 
I know that to be anecdotally false. I know I'm addicted. It may be helpful in moderation, but I know the way I'm mentally attached to it is addictive. I don't know how to break that. 

Any help, motivation, support, or stories from parents who quit for their kids would be really appreciated. I feel pretty alone in this.",23

so basically i started about two and a half years ago just for fun. it was truly fun i had just started college and it was a good time.

then covid hit and i got sent home from school and started going really heavy on it. i would smoke every night and sometimes during the day. i stayed that way for about a year and 3 months.

during that time i met someone who was great and we were into each other. she didn’t smoke and never would. ultimately i told her that i didn’t think i could be with her because i wasn’t sure that i wanted to “settle down” or something stupid like that.

so we split up and i smoked even more for about 3 months. summer came around and
i reconnect with her. we start talking again (by some miracle she was still interested after i told her i basically wanted to smoke instead of be in a relationship). 

we get serious and start dating. i tell her i would quit and i did for about 4 months. then i relapsed (if you wanna call it that) and started smoking in secret. about a month later, she has a dream that i’ve been smoking and asks me if i have been. i can’t lie to her and come clean.

she is very hurt so we begin to discuss it. i’m trying to justify it for whatever reason, saying things like it’s not that bad for me, it’s just for fun, you wouldn’t understand, it’s just like alcohol, etc.

that brings you up to speed lol. basically I’m coming to terms with the fact that i was wrong and that it is hurting people i love. 

tbh i don’t know why im writing this. just needed somewhere to vent to people who might understand. also potentially seeking advice for quitting and staying off. i need to adjust my mindset to convince myself that it really is bad for me and it’s not worth it just for the fun parts.


tl;dr - might lose my relationship because she doesn’t want me to smoke and i’ve been trying to justify it. realized i’m wrong and am looking for advice on quitting and staying off long term.",2

I am a senior in college and have smoking consistently since I began school as a freshman. I used to be strongly against weed, due to the destruction it caused my childhood friends. However, it was a great way to kill time in college. Now that I am ready to graduate, and still have no job (major source of my anxiety atm), weed just doesn't really seem to fit in my life anymore. With that being said, I have made the decision to quit. 

So I do not know the exact amount of time without smoking, I'd guess anywhere between 1.5-2 weeks. I was having troubling falling asleep last night and I smoked a little of my brothers weed. I figured I'd be able to fall right asleep. However, it induced a massive panic attack and I was up til 6 AM. I missed all my classes today and have felt majorly depressed today. It's like I have no emotions. I spent all night beating myself up while I laid in bed high. I have never had such a negative effect before. I woke up today swearing I will never smoke again. That feeling, that panic attack, that day after - I never want to relive it. 

However, I have been walking around my apartment like a zombie and my buddies are worried about me. I mean, so am I. I have no strategies to feel better or to manufacturer happiness into my life. How long will this last? I just want to feel normal again. I feel like such a piece of shit for relapsing. I have my therapist appointment on Friday, but dont think I can make it that long. I am pushing away my boyfriend (largely because he is unaware of the amount I used to smoke). He has been great motivation to stop for sure, but I feel as if I cannot relate to anybody. My roommates see no issue with weed and I feel very alone in all of this.",2

Before covid I smoke once every blue moon ( mainly because I didn't have a plug but still) when covid came and everything was shut down I was bored out of my mind, getting unemployment checks because I was let go, and had nothing to worry about except a few college courses I was taking and already passing. I started smoking every week and then soon every day when I realized it wasn't going to affect any part of my life at the time. I had no where to go, nothing extremely important to do,  and a lot of time to waste.  I just didn't want to get caught by my parents. Plus smoking made me feel calm and relaxed during a time that was a little scary and unfamiliar. Fast forward two years and I was smoking every day.  I started depending on it for everything.  To feel more confident in social situations ( now I feel anxiety), to help me relax after a bad day( always followed by a depressed mood), to boost my good days (depressed mood always followed too), and to help the pain in my back after a drink driver hit my stopped car (temporarily fix).  

I soon realized it was affecting every part of my life.  My grades slacked,  I never wanted to do anything but smoke,  the highlight ( and low point) of my day always involved smoking.  I felt like I was useless.  So I stopped 22 days ago.  And I felt great and now I feel sad.  I wish I could smoke like regular people and not need to do it every day but since I can't I choose to live healthier and I choose to live in a way that will make me happy.

So I've come to the realization that I need to stop cannabis for the umpteenth time. During my best run, I must have stopped it for getting on 18 months, and met a really good fitness circle during it; I was in my best place EVER, both physically and mentally, but clearly, it didn't last.

It seems that the same old people and situations have a habit of sucking my back into being an absolute pothead.

My brain is slower, my lungs, eyes, and heart feel heavy and I'm just so unmotivated to do anything but sit here, smoke, and wallow in my negative thoughts.

I thought that when I changed my career and ended up in a much better place back in 2019 I had it all sorted, but seemingly not; still in the parent's place at 28 wasting my time away and moving nowhere. Rather than paying bills, my biggest outgoing has been cannabis of all things...

I should have learned the first time. So what next...?

Stop for one.

I'm moving out and getting a house with my dear cousin. Maybe this will be an essential step in developing further as a person, at least I certainly hope so.

Ride my bike. And reconnect with my bike friends.

Tell my (very few) current friends who I only smoke with that I'm stopping. I really hope they stick about but history suggests this may not be the case. Que Sera and that.

I hope it goes well, and for you too if you are taking part in this journey also.",3

After a few months of it, I stopped thinking about it. I was filling my days, evenings, and weekends with other things. I did (and do) still get cravings but they're smaller every time and easier to ignore.

In the first few months I leaned heavily on the Reddit and Discord communities to help me through it and slowly I started forgetting to check in because I was busy living a sober life. I was expanding my business and spending time with my family. I was doing things that challenged my mind and body. 

Sometimes sobriety felt unattainable but it's not. You can do it! You can continue to do it!

Some things that helped me:

\- talking through my feelings with the Discord group  
\- writing down my ""why"" and putting it somewhere I could see easily  
\- make a list of non-weed rewards and self-care tactics  
\- make plans to stay busy  
\- read ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear (twice, in my case)

He’s been smoking for about 10 years and knows it’s been a coping mechanism for him.

It was really fun when we were first dating, and it was new to me so I hadn’t experienced long term use before.

After about 6 months of dating, he failed his drug test to begin his medical residency and almost lost his spot to practice medicine (meaning his career is gone and he’s stuck with crazy loans). They gave him another chance and he passed a test a few months later and is now in his medical residency training. We were both sober for a few months, and he said he was done with weed - since that whole experience was so traumatizing for both of us. Well it didn’t last long and since then he/we fluctuate with smoking habits.

I feel if we weren’t together he’d smoke every day and not think about it. It’s fun in the moment for me but really not good for my emotional state/ptsd. It’s really hard for me to not smoke thought when he is also smoking. To be honest I just think he wants me to smoke with him so he offers often. 

It’s hard to watch because I feel like it’s an escape for him but he doesn’t seem to want to get too close to the topic of it being a problem or something serious.

I just don’t know if I should stick around to see what happens or leave early in the relationship before something bad happens (like him getting caught with another drug test)",2

- I am less irritable/prone to anger
- My emotions feel much more regulated 
- I can go for walks without the impulse to smoke 
- I can focus on establishing healthier routines
- I am less focused on seeking out temporary pleasures 

Now the one thing that abstaining from weed hasn't fixed are all the issues that were extant prior to picking it up. Depression, anxiety, suicidal ideations, repetitive thoughts, etc. Weed is effective for self medicating because it actively represses all the bullshit going on in your head. So when you stop self medicating, all of these things you're dealing with have no buffer. You have to confront them sober, which is difficult but overall healthier as you now have to decide how to move on with your life with all this baggage you haven't dealt with. Now you have a chance to deal with it. Just wanted to share for anyone experiencing the same thing.",12

After trying to quit every month for the last year I decided January 1 that enough is enough. Threw away my supply and anything I had associated with weed because this time just felt different. 

Weed has had me living in my head for the last 3+ years. All I could think about when I was sober was when the next time I would be high, and when I was high I would be mad at myself that I couldn’t quit. It’s crazy how much this drug had a hold of me.

I started frequenting this sub and related to many others stories and experiences. Self-realization was everything this time around. I realized how much weed had effected my mental health, my emotions and my relationships.. so many aspects of my life. 

I used this drug as a compensatory mechanism. Too stressed, too anxious, couldn’t sleep, bad day at work etc. Weed would be the easy answer. Masking all my issues and problems. Because of this I lost my ability to deal with any of these issues myself when I was sober. Anxiety was through the rough and I was terrible to be around. I’ve been seeing a therapist to relearn my own coping mechanisms. I highly recommend this if it is a resource available to you.  

One month down and I feel like I’m discovering who I truly am for the first time in years, without the aid of this drug. I’ll be honest in saying that there are aspects of myself that I don’t like but the important thing is I’m realizing this and dealing with it myself and finally feeling content.

The benefits however have been endless. I look forward to clear days over cloudy days. My relationships have been improving. Work performance has been more focused and productive. Looking forward to things other than when I’m getting high next. I can go on and on..

I’m proud of myself and everyone that’s committed to, or is thinking about quitting. 1 year, 1 month, 1 day, 1 hour. Wherever you are in your journey just know you have my support. Thank you to everyone who’s helped me with my journey so far. Looking forward to keep this going!",18

I have been completely clean of mind and mood altering substances since, with my main focus being marijuana as I actively smoked for years before that. I’ve gotten an MA sponser and gone to meetings, even going as far as picking up service positions. 

Now as I close in on my two years, I find motivating myself to stay sober to be a challenge. This past year I started college in person for the first time and I have no sober friends in the new city. MA meetings are online so I haven’t met up with anyone from the program in my city. 

My friends all smoke and have offered it to me a few times but mostly they don’t invite me to hang when drugs are being used. 

How do you continue to motivate yourself a year or two into recovery? I feel like it’s straining my friendships that I don’t smoke and I’ve gone as far as deleting social media to avoid triggers from being left out of social situation. 

Going back to marijuana is not an option as I feel strongly that I can’t moderate use and I fear using will trigger psychosis as I’ve since being diagnosed with such.

2022-02-01 12:37:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/si0n9t/day_1/,Day 1,"Hi! 37F, first joint with 14/15(?), semi-regular in my teens, regular smoker since my twenties. The last 15 years 2-3 joints daily. Always mixed with tobacco, always at night after work while putting on a series on my tablet. 

This is gonna be long, putting everything in words helps take the anxiety away. I can't stop thinking about the evening and the idea of not smoking is unsettling, so I'll just write it all out...

First of all I want to say that finding this sub has helped me finally (!) make the decision and really do it. I was thinking about reducing/quitting for a couple years now, but just couldn't bring myself to do it. To be honest, in all those American movies where they go to AA meetings and people are just talking about their issues never made sense nor appealed to me: why and how should that help? They are just talking abstractly about their life and how hard it is to not drink/do drugs/etc.

Then I found this sub and the concept started making sense to me: There are some messages I don't identify with, but there are lots I do. I see my own mind reflected in many thought processes that you all share. And just knowing that there are other people out there struggling just like me, but also rooting for everybody that comes here is... calming? Reassuring? Although I low-key knew, this sub also helped me to just accept and put in words that it is an addiction and I should treat it like that and that I'm an addict and it may not be as simple as ""just stopping"". Until fully accepting that I just had no (apparent) reason to quit: I am a highly functioning addict. Good job, marriage, friends, the whole thing.

BUT and here comes a big but, nobody except my husband knew. Well, people did know that I smoked, but in the sense that most people smoke: If offered they'll take drag or two in social settings and that's it for them for a few months or years. Not even my closest friends knew that even when I was out for an afterwork drink with them I was subconsciously thinking ""I'm excited to get home and smoke"". It was hard to admit that I basically planned my social life around being able to smoke. Not staying to long at a party so I could still have 1-2 hours to myself that night. Neglecting friendships because I would rather smoke than videocall them (pandemic times) - and no, I didn't interact with anybody except my husband when high. Smoking for me is a highly introspective activity. Another word could be isolating, now that I think of it.

One time i just smoked after a long day to wind down and suddenly some friends stopped by - the horror! I was preparing to doing my best to not appear high when my husband says laughingly to them ""don't mind her looking tired, she just smoked a joint"" and I wanted the earth to swallow me - I was so embarrassed. The thing is, the friend also smokes, so that was no tabu, no ""OMG!"" nothing. Just my own perceived ineptitude in dealing with people while high and people knowing that I was high.

I remember about two years ago while high thinking: ""I love smoking. But I don't like who I am when I'm high"". I started to think that I wanted to quit every time I was high. But the next day when I was sober I just couldn't wait to get home and smoke. An endless cycle of frustration, excuses (I need it. today was a hard day. I earned it. I want to put the cherry on top of this nice day) which I just couldn't break.

Lots of people here say that money was the issue. Or smoke directly after waking up not being able to function during the day. That's the thing: I spend more money on tobacco/going out for a beer thank weed. I maybe spent 15-20€ per month? Also I rarely smoked in the morning, but I have to admit that sleeping in on the weekends, having an extra long breakfast (brunch) and then smoking and spending the afternoon watching movies was great. But then again: there goes the whole day. Just lounging high on the sofa, not doing anything - even mentally.

I used to read A LOT as a kid. I still like to read, but I haven't read a single book the last year or the year before that. When I start a book (on a plane mostly) I get so absorbed into the story, I literally can't think about anything else for hours or even days. But then i come back home and reading and smoking don't go together, so I put the halfread book aside and light a joint. Smoking for me is linked with passive media consumption: watching series and youtube for hours. That's literally all I use my tablet for. So that's one thing I look forward to: get back into reading. There are sooo many science fiction books I want to read and this is one thing I look forward to.

I actually wanted to stop a few weeks ago, but got way to anxious about the ""THIS IS THE LAST JOINT OF MY LIFE"" part so I convinced my husband to get another baggie. It sucks, but I just like smoking. It has become such an engrained habit in my life that I really feel I'll miss out on something. I'm also a bit scared of what it means in terms of facing my own issues. Being high it's really easy to go ""yeah, I'll tackle that tomorrow"" instead of taking action like looking for a therapist. At this point I don't know if I am an anxious person or if weed made me anxious. I'm scared to find out I won't like what I find.

Right now there is nothing left to smoke at home - make no mistake: I smoked it all. I scraped my grinder clean. I emptied the box I used to keep everything. This means I have been reducing for about a week - yesterday I smoked the last flecks of dust from my grinder. Probably was more a placebo effect than anything, but I couldn't let it go unused. Now, I have nothing left and also no way to get more. We recently moved and my husband is the one who joined the ""dispensary"", not me. He never was that addicted, was already reducing a lot and hasn't smoked for a couple of weeks without problems. He is 100% supportive. So my only way to get some would be through my husband, which will not happen.

So this time around I set myself a goal: No smoking until June. It had to be a long-term goal, because I know I can perfectly go without smoking for weeks while I'm on vacation, visiting my parents, etc. (anything that takes place outside my home) but i couldn't stomach the ""last smoke ever"" anxiety. So I mentally set this goal giving me permission to smoke in June. I was already stressing out about it (you're planning to smoke again! what's the point then! you shouldn't smoke! which means ""this is the last smoke ever!!"" and cue anxiety again) but I figure doing SOMETHING is better than doing nothing and I may find myself in any of these situations:  
I ""discover"" myself again and by that point don't feel the need to smoke.  
I may be pregnant (we will start trying at some point) and therefor I won't smoke even though I may feel the need. (much easier doing something for somebody else's benefit than your own)  
I still want to smoke so I buy and smoke again. Maybe that's a relapse, maybe I'll find that I don't like it anymore since I was able to establish healthier habits of dealing with my day and myself.  
I have no idea. It's hard for me not to plan everything and not know what will happen. To the point that today I was thinking ""so what if I keep smoking. maybe that's just my life and I like it"" because I don't know what will happen to me, to my body. My comfortzone is knowing I can ""turn off"" by the end of the day watching series. Or getting into hyperfocus and do manual stuff I like doing (which I could do perfectly fine without smoking).

I'm still more in the ""i'll miss x"" mindset than the ""I'll gain x"" mindset, that's where all the nostalgia is coming from. I read this thought on twitter and it spoke to me:

3 months without smoking: Wow, that's what life is like without weed.  
9 months without smoking: wow - THAT's how it is.  
15 months without smoking: oh so THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT!  
3 years without smoking: OHMY THIS IS HOW IT IS!!!

Thinking about this person helps keep in mind that there is a long way to go, but there are things to discover along the whole way.

Another was a thing an illustrator I admire shared with me (after sending her a message that her recent comic about her overcoming her weed-addiction really resonated with me because of the similarities). She said:  
I was in your situation. In a couple of months you'll be another person and you'll ask yourself  
**""Why didn't I do this sooner?""**

I'm keeping that simple sentence in mind and it really helps me because I hope (like to think) that me from the future will say exactly that. That there will be some positive change that I'm not able to see or anticipate right now that will make me say...Why didn't I do it sooner?",4

Let's see... I'm sitting here looking around the room to see what's different...oh..I don't have an f-ing weed hangover! (Maybe a little bit of a dehydrated nicotine vape hangover haha...that's next on my quit list)

Anyway, I'm diligently checking my quit weed app to see what I'm working towards fixing and where I'm at. I love looking at the reasons to quit section I made. It's a very brief statement in my reasons to quit area but it's enough to keep me going. The biggest reasons are to be a real life, sober, human being for my husband instead of a potato and then my newest reason...the passing of my pet fish Quinn who I had for four years. 

Okay this is getting too long with not much substance, boy I can really ramble...sorry I'll be posting these probably every morning I don't smoke weed haha, I have nowhere else to share my success because everyone around me either smokes weed or doesn't see weed as an addiction/problem :/ 

Thank you all for sharing in this community, without it I'm afraid I'd have zero motivation to quit because I can't seem to get support anywhere but here

2022-02-01 11:24:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/shywi7/advice_and_tips_for_quitting_in_2022/,Advice and Tips for quitting in 2022,"Everyone I wanted to make this post because of what im reading on this forum. Because of all the negativity that most of you feel after quitting and changing your lifestyle habits. I cant respond to each of you individually, so I wanted to make a general post and I hope this reaches a lot of you.

I had my own journey of quitting on new years eve. 9 years of heavy usage. I mean really heavy usage in the hundreds of MG a day because I liked to get high as fuck. Covid was the worst since I had no one to connect with and my family drama was higher than ever

I quit on Dece 31 2021. I went cold turkey. Anxiety, stress paranoia and chest tightness. 12 days later I relapsed and had a 10-20mg thc thinking I wouldnt feel it. I slept and was paranoid as fuck, woke up and fucken hated myself for doing that. My symptoms got a lil worse so I did the following.

I got a therapist. Therapy is a beautiful thing. Having someone to speak to and just vent my emotions really helped. I just completed my 3rd session and my pre session score dropped from 66 to 7! Its amazing after 3 weeks.

I signed up at a nice ass gym! I mean really nice and boujie and with this amazing view. I am a big guy but I am athletic. So I took my energy and put it into running and exercising and getting tired. I built my energy over the last month and now I can run for 40 mins, row for another 20, do free weigths for another 30, and some other exercises before I am in the sauna for 10 and done.

I got into meditation on the beach. I go and enjoy the beautiful sunset in CA weekly and meditate. Just apprecaite life for what it is. I had a near death accident a few years ago, part of the reason why I got deeper into THC and not pills. I tell you all, life is fucking BEAUTIFUL! Look outside, the beautiful trees, sky, just know that everything and everyone is beautiful, especially YOU!

I turned on some stand up comedy on different streaming platforms and just learned how to enjoy laughing soberly and smiling and being happy without having to be high! I swear it helps and keeps your mind off things.

If you have a friend you can confide in or a family member, do it. Make it an effort to speak to them daily and vent. If you can spend time with others and not being alone. but be mindful that you will be agitated, anxious, stressed. I dont recommend using alcohol to balance it out. which brings me to my next point

GET YOUR DIET FIXED and DRINK LOTS OF WATER! You will have a shitty appetite for a few weeks. You will lose weight. Thinking something is wrong with you. Eat healthy, dont forcefully stufff yourself. Drink lots of water and keep hydrated. Your body has thc in its fat cells. It needs time to burn it off and clear the system. Your body is like a vehicle. The engine, the tranny, the tires, it needs to stay in top shape while it clears the gas tank of the diesel fuel you put in a premium engine.

I recommend reading some books. DM ME I can share, so I will just recommend looking into some Cognitive Behavior Books. The GODFATHER of CB is well known and I recommend his book to all.

One important thing I want to note is the paranoia. I felt like omg I have a flu, or I have an std or something. The anxiety and paranoia that comes from the detox is insane. DO NOT WORRY I swear you are ok. Unless you really have something to worry about. Just breathe. Know that each day will get easier. You are alive and thats the most important thing.

And lastly, Smile! I promise you this will get better. I promise you that each day that passes will get easier. You might have a day or two that will throw you off, but if you need anything come here and vent ill try to listen and switch up the vibe.

&#x200B;

Im sending you all good vibes from beautiful CA. I hope you are all safe, happy, and doing better today. Tomorrow will be even better and I cant wait for you to conquer this new journey/lifestyle change!

&#x200B;

PURA VIDA!!!!",7

I’m so dependent on it. As soon as I have no more responsibilities I immediately turn to it. And recently I’ve been pushing back my responsibilities just to justify smoking. I tell myself “fuck it, covid fucked up my college life, might as well get stoned every day”. 

It’s strange because in a lot of ways it hasn’t affected my life so much. My grades are still somewhat impressive while graduating with a mechanical engineering major this June, I made the school club boxing team earlier this year that I’m still a part of, I’m still going out on dates and hanging out and seeing people,, on the outside things are looking good.

But it’s like what an earlier post said: how weed makes you an observer. Lately I feel like a spectator of my own life. I never know what to say in groups, at parties I’m a wall flower, and these days Im constantly second guessing my “performance” of how well i socialized, if I contributed to the conversation, if I’m being liked… just so much overthinking.

I saw my ex at the club for the first time since we broke up a year and a half ago, and I realized I have been smoking pretty much every single day since then (except for 2 weeks in august on a vacation). She asked me “how’s life?” And I couldn’t believe how little had changed since the breakup. How little I had emotionally matured (if at all), how little I had moved on.. oh god I hadn’t processed any of my shit cuz I was just being high all the time. I responded, “you know, it’s going alright”. 

I think it’s time I get a little grip on my life. Someone told me the good thing about weed is it tells you when it’s time to stop it and put it down. Bad thing about me is I’m really good at ignoring that voice. Until now that is. Wish me luck ✊🏽",9

That really sounds a lot.

It all began when i was a teenager with suicidal tendencies. The weed was the only thing that would make me avoid the destructive thoughts.

Parents never cared much about mental suffering, they used to mock me about it to avoid any responsability.

28 years passed by... tried to quit sometimes, but never more than a week or two.

My hole life was based on it. Getting home from work and get high alone. 

Finally i decided to change for good.

I enrolled in an addiction group with my therapists office (because AA/NA never helped before) and so far my determination to quit has not lessened one little bit. I am right now on day 17. My reason for smoking was detaching from my emotions. I've had pretty severe CPTSD with constant flashbacks for years and I did not know any other way to cope. Now I do - after extensive traumatreatments and EMDR that took care of my flashbacks I am ready for this last hurdle and step fully back into the arena of life. But Id be lying if I werent struggling immensly with believing in myself that I can handle the emotions that come up. I joined this group today to learn more about the detox effects and what might help. Right now I have sweaty palms - raised heartbeat and just general nervousness. I have a lot of tools in my box. I did inner child work, I sing in a choir since recently (always been to afraid to sing in public) and I know how to be mindfull and meditate. But I find myself scrambling to run away from emotions - and then become aware and turn around - so its been a journey. My goal is to be a complete cyclebreaker of generational trauma. My kids are 9 and 6. And I can tell Im almost there. Just this. Im scared and emotional - Ive been crying alot. Which i suppose is healty and I know I need to do but yeah. Not nice to go through daily. This thursday I have my first day on a new job. I am having trouble believing I can do this. I have to get up at 5 which is also a bit aaaaaah. Well anyway.

I’m 22 years old, making my way through college, and I have been smoking weed since I was 15 years old. Had always thought it was strictly recreational for me, until I realized recently that I’m losing time, money, and wasting away, letting it become so mandatory. And I’m just so tired of it being the center of my life. 

Everything is beginning to feel like it’s passing me by. Instead of hanging out with new friends, or staying up on social media, or being on top of my school work like I need to, I’m instead content to spend an entire day being high and playing video games, or watching movie after movie, or eating in excess. Hell, I feel like I don’t even bother putting myself out there with girls anymore, because what’s the point when I can get high and hop on the PlayStation all night, right? I’m sick of it. 

Weed is stopping me from doing the work I need to do in school, stopping me from fully pursuing my passion how I need to. I’m in school studying singing opera, and I know that being constantly wrapped up in when I’ll get high next is just totally decimating my potential. Whether it be the harshness on the throat, the lack of sleep from staying up getting high all night, the time spent playing games and watching movies instead of studying and practicing. I know this is my passion, and I have what it takes, except it seems discipline, probably the most important thing. 

I’m just tired of it, and I want to find a path out. I try to spend a day or more without smoking, but looking back, outside of trying again to change things, I’ve been smoking since I was 15 and I basically haven’t stopped. High has been the new normal for years and frankly I’m surprised I’ve been able to get as far as I have with my singing, but I just wish I could stop and take control of my life again, to remember who I really am without bud, and any support or words of encouragement would go a long way. I just want to be comfortable being me again. Thanks.",8

I don't remember my dreams, and I never wake up thinking or knowing I've had one. When I sleep, its a full body power down. I've only had the same 4-5 dreams sporadically repeat themselves throughout my life. Every time I've quit, I've never had vivid dreams (just sweat, yay). 

To preface this: I finished a Japanese minor in university 4 years ago, literally haven't spoken or read any since (a big fuck you to weed).

So, imagine my surprise on day 5 when I woke up from a dream that was COMPLETELY in Japanese. When I opened my eyes from the dream, I couldn't work out what country I was in (Japan or Australia?), and so I sat up super quick to try and gather myself. My fiancée gently nudged me to ask what was happening, and that's the first time he heard me speak another language 😂 I've never been so geographically or linguistically confused.

Upside? I now have a ravenous hunger to relearn the language, because I made up a lot of verbs in my dream 😂

Sleep is vital for recovery in all aspects of our life, including recovering from marijuana addiction.
