I've lived with my (adult) family since the outbreak. Two parents, two brothers, and my sister. It had pretty much been my goal to spend the least amount of time around them as possible, without them being able to tell that that was my goal. There was already so much guaranteed time I'd be around them, and I'd been becoming increasingly irritable in regards to each of their quirks. I *am* a pretty big introvert, so I had been attributing my behavior mostly to that.

I'm at \~day 5 today. For the first time in forever, I voluntarily stuck around after dinner and talked for hours. It's not like this was a conscious decision, though, I was just enjoying their presence and enjoying *my own* presence. These past few days, I've been way more bright in every figurative sense of the word.

It's funny.. now I'm kinda embarrased to show them my true self, because I feel like it highlights just how unnecessarily cold I'd been for this entire year.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.41455612}"
2021-03-30 23:25:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mgx36b/day_1_down/,Day 1 Down,"TL;DR - I'm finally quitting after almost 15 years. It's compulsory, but I hope it sticks this time.

&#x200B;

The timeline is dubious, considering I was up pretty late last night, nevertheless I am counting today as my first day clean!

This isn't something I've thought much about doing. Why would you stop doing something you've done multiple times a day for over a decade? Well in my case it is compulsory, because of a job, but a part of me has always wanted to quit anyway for multiple reasons. It's a bit scary to think that even though I wanted to, I probably never could have, or more importantly WOULD have quit, unless I had some dire reasoning behind it.

This is the same drug that is supposedly harmless, and is celebrated and glorified by Hollywood and ""cool kids"" all around the world. It's illegal, so I must be fighting the system by smoking it, right? WRONG. I can't tell you the money I've spent, the brain fog I've had to fight through, the inherent guilt and paranoia, the distancing of myself from friends and family that ""aren't cool"". There's a cost to be paid here, make no mistake.

So then, what's so good about it? I would first admit that there is a feeling of euphoria, except that I really don't know if that's the case anymore, not for me. I saw someone else post that they like ""the idea of getting high"" more than actually doing it. THIS IS SPOT ON. Yesterday, when I contemplated my departure from THC, I felt a sense of dread, longing, despair, etc. Yet, at the same time, these feelings were not causing me to smoke. I wasn't worried about the actual high, I was worried about something that has been so deeply ingrained in my daily life that I've come to view it as a piece of me, and that by getting rid of it, I would be essentially getting rid of myself and I wouldn't know who I was anymore. 

I love to play video games. I love books and fiction. I love my girlfriend, and my daughters. I like to work hard and relax afterwards. I have a core set of beliefs and values and I love to listen to others and learn new things. NONE OF THESE THINGS will go away once I stop smoking. I'm still going to be me, and maybe more importantly, the people around me will still love me for who I am. If they don't, they were never true friends.

This has gotten really long, and to be honest, I just had to vent my feelings and keep myself busy for a little. I still will appreciate any input or comments on this.

I thought my panic attacks in the morning when I was smoking weed were bad, today they were just completely awful. My mind just seems to be constantly going in bad places unless I listen to music.

The past week or so I 've been craving smoking, though. Everything just feels so monotonous. Part of it is the fact that we're in a pandemic, another part is that my college classes this semester are significantly harder than they have been in the past so I feel like I constantly need to catch up. Either way, every day feels the same as the last.

 I've been making an effort to still see friends pretty regularly, and that's actually been going better than I expected given that most of my friends are stoners. They've been really supportive of me no longer smoking. My mental health has improved a ton too. But I can't help but feel so empty sometimes. Like I need something to look forward to. Hanging out with my friends is great and all, but it doesn't feel like enough. My therapist said quitting weed would make my relationships more fulfilling, but I don't know about that. 

Consciously, I know that smoking's not the answer, but I can't help but long for it subconsciously. Looking at old memories on snapchat, I miss the first two years of college when I'd be hanging out with a big group of friends, all getting drunk and high and doing stupid shit together. My best memories are of those stupid hijinks. I keep telling myself that it's not the weed I miss, it's the social environment, and smoking won't fill that hole. Even though there's no large gatherings like those right now because of the pandemic, I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on those moments.

2021-03-30 21:19:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mguvme/79_days_clean_effects_lessons/,79 days clean - Effects & Lessons,"Today marks 79 days clean from the dreaded plant that is cannabis. Oh, how you were my friend for so long, or so I thought. You enticed me, you got me hooked, and then you slowly sucked away everything I cared about , taking up more and more space in my life until I decided I had to break up with you for good.

I had gotten into the habit of smoking somewhere in the range of 1.5-1.75g a day of high potency weed (at least 20% THC), either via a vaporizer or using THC extract vape pens. I smoked pretty much from the moment I woke up (my wife would go walk the dog right after making the coffee and that was my cue to get high) until bed time. I smoked in the middle of work days, sometimes literally going off of camera for a moment so I could hit the vape pen and then returning to a conference call (which in hindsight is terrifying given how risky that could be to my career).

Here are some of the things I experienced along this journey, from the monstrous to the fantastic:

1. Stress and Anxiety - the initial days of quitting were (quite understandably) a nightmare. I was frought with stress and anxiety about the act of quitting itself, mostly believing that I couldn’t do it, and that the withdrawal symptoms would be terrible. The silver lining of working from home was I could go through that without the pressure of live social situations, but I would say the first week was a very stressful and anxious affair.

2. Sweats - Oh man, how I sweat profusely! My hands and feet in particular were swimming pools, but I sweat all over for about 4-5 weeks. It overall wasn’t TERRIBLE but it felt like my nervous system was in overdrive trying to get the toxins out of me. I would wake up and immediately my hands and feet felt warm and didn’t really subside until the evening time when my adrenal system ran out of gas. This got a lot better eventually, and while I still sometimes get clammy, it’s entirely manageable and I would say typical

3. Brain Fog - Honestly, weeks 2-4 i was useless. I had so much brain fog that I felt more high than I did before when I was smoking. While the first week gave me a bit of a clarity rush, the subsequent ones turned me back into a zombie. This did go away but it took some time, longer than I had hoped but necessary to get through

4. Vivid Dreams - I started dreaming again! Although some of them were a little intense. Around the 45 day mark I had a relapse nightmare and felt SO GOOD waking up knowing it was only a dream and my progress hadn’t been destroyed. I dream every night now, but rarely are they about cannabis or super vivid, just regular dreams. 

5. Emotional Overload - I was finally able to process emotions, and man wears that a new experience after 15 years of daily smoking. I was able to reflect and uncover some things about myself that drove me to drugs in the first place, and while difficult, it was ultimately a healing process to be able to confront them with a sober mind and take the first step towards broader emotional health and well-being

6. Feelings of Ease and Ultimately Satisfaction - here’s where things get good, which is that I no longer feel trapped by a substance that defines my life. I feel at ease day-to-day (at least when it comes to drug addition), knowing that this burden isn’t on my shoulders and jeopardizing my career, relationships and health. It’s a great feeling that I wouldn’t trade for a hit of a joint.

So in short, was it difficult? Absolutely. Was it uncomfortable at times? Totally. Was it **worth it** 110 percent. And to wrap this up, a few short but easy things to tell yourself for those who are starting out.

1. You CAN do this
2. Take it one day at a time
3. Don’t have any expectations beyond not smoking weed; the rest will come in due time
4. It WILL get easier

I've been completely free since March 15. Oddly enough, not keeping perfect count of my days has helped me put less pressure on. Day 7 without smoking was a huge victory since it took me five or six tries since December to get there again. Not relapsing again the weekend after the gummies was another milestone, but I was too anxious to try to celebrate.

I just started a highly condensed college course to get into long term resident care. About the tiniest step into the range of nursing careers one can make. The course is so intense that today, just day 2, I did 5 hours of homework before taking a nap and am just about to do some more revision before doing household chores and going to bed.

I had the most incredible moment while I was on the edge of tears trying to wrap my head around this chapter on cell structure and tissues. There was so much new vocabulary to take in that it felt like I was reading Greek (and I suppose since it's anatomical terminology, sometimes I was!). I suddenly realized I couldn't make it through this AT ALL if I was high. The amount of concentration it's taking for each page of work, the willpower to sit in one place and get through it, the knowledge that I have to push through all of this again tomorrow... if I wasn't sober I would have no choice but to drop out and miss my opportunity to start the career path I couldn't reach back when I left high school.

I don't feel like I have time for another relapse. I don't think I have desire for it. It's dangerous to consider myself free of the addiction so I'm certainly not saying that.

I joined this thread right after leaving my old FB messenger group chat full of old high school friends that just sit around and smoke weed in that same shitty small town. I moved from that town about 10 years ago and actually even out of the country 5 years ago... but I've always smoked.  

  
My dad gave me my first hit when I was 12 years old... I started buying ""dime bags"" (that word makes me feel old, haven't heard it called that since 2005...) about 6 months later from a friend at school who had a dirt bag high school aged brother.   

  
I did the whole ""smoke weed every day"" from the time I was about 14 to 21. Then I got caught with about a pound and was given 5 years probation with a piss test every month. I still smoked, I would just stop and detox about 2 weeks before I knew I had the test... 3 and 1/2 years later I get off probation.   

  
Still smoking, now off probation for about 6 years and, as mentioned previously, in a new country, married with a kid and another kid on the way. Every night when I finish work and the kids are in bed and FOR SURE asleep, I go out into the backyard and smoke a small bowl and watch YouTube videos ('Frog Time' is the best!)

Sadly, it's always been more of an addiction to me. I'm nearly 20, and have been smoking daily for 3 years now, probably at least a couple grams a day or more. But that really quickly changed six days ago.

I took a hit from my bong in the afternoon, not unusual for me, from a strain I've been using for weeks now (so not laced or anything), when all of a sudden, I got a huge head rush, followed by one of the most uncomfortable feelings I've ever felt in my life... it wasn't pain, and after musing on it for a while, I realized it was akin to anxiety, like *really* bad anxiety. Almost like constantly being on the verge of a panic attack.

I didn't connect the dots immediately, and continued smoking small amounts for the next couple days, but no matter what I tried (dabs, edibles, vaping flower, joints, bongs), it gave me that feeling of *panic*... like a needle shooting adrenaline into my chest at every moment. So, 3 days ago, I just cold-turkey quit.

The last week has probably been one of the worst that I've ever felt in my life, or if there was a list, top 3 worst weeks for sure. I've never had extreme anxiety problems, but even after I quit smoking, the feeling stayed for days, and almost nothing helped, except for one non-prescription medication.

Today is the first day where the anxiety feeling has almost completely subsided. I can't even think about picking up a joint or hitting a bowl anymore, it immediately makes me think of the extreme anxiety it made me feel.

I've only seen a couple other people on this subreddit say they have had experiences somewhat similar to this one, and frankly, what happened to me really scared me. I still don't understand how I could have been so anxious for so long, I was worried I would feel like that forever, or that I'd permanently damaged my body.

The most interesting thing to me, though, is how the feeling I got from smoking shifted like *that,* the snap of a finger. I'm basically forced to stay completely sober if I want to feel normal; it's sort of a blessing and a curse.

I think my body might have been telling me that enough was enough, and it is time to start living life normally again. Day 4 of no smoking, and I never intend to return.

I've been lurking for a few weeks now and reading many of your posts has been a real value added to my mission. I'll share some of my tips, and history, but primarily I am trying to figure out where I am at in the return to dreaming.

I had not gone more than 72hrs without smoking/dabbing/vaping/eating THC in 17 years. Leading up to my quit date I was ingesting upwards of 600mg of THC/RSO and dabbing 0.3grams per day.

Right now I am on day 13 and aside from irritability and insomnia I feel relatively great, for a few reasons I imagine.

\* Intense exercise for 25minutes at a time (I use a stationary bike) usually before bed, sometimes earlier if I'm having cravings. This has done wonders to get my mind off weed and release a little dopamine to pick me back up. Prior to this I had never really worked out, so it hasn't been a breeze. 

\* Drinking tons of lemon water and avoiding more than one cup of tea and >3 alcoholic drinks... the hardest times for me to abstain from smoking is after I've had 2-3 drinks and I start to let down my guard and question ""do I really need to give up weed, or can I just moderate better"" Devil on the shoulder.

\* Thinking of all the positive feedback I read on here and how it will only get better the longer I go.

With all of that being said my question is, will I ever dream again?!?! lol

Many years ago I experienced the intense return to dreaming after abstaining for a handful of days, so I'm familiar with the experience. However, this time around I'm about 2 weeks in and NOTHING.

Wondering if my body is just taking longer to break down the thc because of the levels I used at but after diving thru old posts I really couldn't find many people who share my experience right now

I would like some advice on how to maintain sobriety after I’m no longer “forced to” I’ve been smoking for about a year and a half now give or take and I’ve noticed a steady drop in my enjoyment for life outside being high, as well as a just general worsening of my personality. I’m an asshole to my friends some of which have cut ties, my wonderful loving girlfriend (who also smokes but for medical reasons) I’ve withdrawn from my family as well. I didn’t have any motivation nor did I care about anything other than a blunt. I’ve attempted to quit numerous time with only one time being successful for about a month and a half in the beginning of last year . Currently I’m on day 5, and that’s partially by choice partially by force because I’m 1500 miles away from my home on vacation, I took this vacation as a way to forcibly make myself sober in hopes that when I get back I will be thru the worst of withdrawals and be able to hold up to the urges to smoke. I’m noticing markable differences in my tone, my ability to feel emotions, and I’m actually somewhat talking to people again. I recognize all of these benefits like I did the first time I quit but I worry I might relapse once I get back home and am surrounded by my friend and girlfriend who both smoke. What is some good advice to maintain sobriety? 
edit I should also probably mention my use started as a way to self medicate my ADHD for the longest time I couldn’t smoke due to a very traumatic event (major car wreck) my first time smoking I used to get panic attacks anytime I was around it.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44751444}"

Get a sheet a of paper. divide it into 4 quadrants.

First Quadrant: list all the PROs of why you smoke weed. You wouldn’t be continuing to smoke cannabis if it didn’t bring you positives. so Be honest with your self, Why do love weed so much? Is it how it calms your anxiety down, do you love the smell of it? Does it help you forget about your problems? Do you love smoking with your buddies? Does it help you with boredom? List EVERYTHING you can think of the good that weed brings you in this area.

Second quadrant: list all the CONS of resisting the urge to smoke weed. Why is abstinence from weed so shitty and so hard? Is it because you’ll feel things that will make you uncomfortable, is it hard to tolerate the boredom of being sober? Will you feel left out when your buddies pass that joint around when your hanging. Be honest and list all the things you can think of 

Third quadrant: what are the CONS of continuing to smoke weed? This is where you list all the reasons that weed is holding you back from a better life. Does your constant weed use make your mind cloudy? Have you become sloppy at your day job? Is it increasing your depression and anxiety? Are you constantly forgetting your keys and phone everywhere? Have you been digging yourself deeper into debt to finance your smoking habit? Has your physical health and breathing deteriorated from weed use? Does weed fuel your procrastination of your responsibilities? All the above allowed to me and If your on the subreddit you KNOW in your heart what this list is for you. It might be different for you but, really let this list make sink in. 

Fourth quadrant: list the PROs of resisting the urge to smoke weed. Who could you be when you aren’t smoking weed? What could you accomplish? How much money would you save? Would your mind be more clear and sharp allowing you to operate at a higher capacity at work? Would you be more present with your children/spouse/partner? 

Have this list in a visible place where every day you’re reminded of why you’re fighting to a build a better future for yourself. Put it on the fridge, in the car, or even on your phones Lock Screen. Remind your self when the craving comes of the hell you’re trying to avoid and the heaven you’re trying to build for yourself. —For me whenever a craving hits me I say to myself: CLEAR MIND, MORE MONEY.  Like I said before, Your reasons might be different.

TLDR below,"I‘m 24 and smoke daily since ~4 years. It took about the last 18 months to realise just enough how bad it affects me. 

I always wondered when reading these insane posts where people are years sober, did you started cold turkey or did you slowly reduce your consumption?
Because it really sounds like most people in here quitted cold turkey. 

Thing is I got pretty depressed the last few years. For those who cant relate I think my experience is best described as extremly overthinking the simplest situations (like should I go into this store and buy a nice sandwich, should I go to the laundromat) with the same outcome everytime - I don‘t do what I normally would like to do/should do. It really makes no fucking sense seeing myself acting in these situations.

The last two days were better than expected. I even hung out with friends once, they smoked - I didnt. Urges were okay, sleep wasn‘t to bad (just woke up 1-2 times a night) only thing that really bugged me was sweating most of the time but it was bearable. 

However today was crazy different, urges were way stronger than the last two days, my mood was incredibly bad and I reacted quite toxic whenever someone from my family spoke to me today.

The last few days I read a lot about how weed affects the production of your happiness hormones (hope it translates like that, sounds pretty weird). That basically after smoking daily for a long time, weed is the only thing that can make you happy, at least until you dealt with your addiction. 

So right now I‘m asking myself what should I do? What did you guys do? Is it okay to reward yourself now and then? Cause feeling like today for like a month or just weeks would suck way too much. 

On the other hand I tried slowing down and it dindn‘t work either, but I also never made 2 days and 18 hours before (and I‘m fucking proud of that). You realize I‘m a bit confused rn. However thanks for reading and I hope I could explain myself clear enough. 

TLDR: First two days sober were okay, third was quite a mess mentally and I felt way more depressed than I already feel with weed. Struggling with my decision to quit cold turkey and really asking myself what would be the best way. How did you deal with that?

I had quit a while ago, a little over a month at this point. As I was coming up on my one month mark, I had a say off of work and the urge hit really hard. I decided that I'd scrape my grinders and smoke whatever was left. Turned out to be a bowl of kief that I got.

So I waited until around 3pm and smoked the bowl. I will say with honesty that the first hour or so was fun, just watching YouTube videos and playing games. Afterwards though, the foggy and slow feeling didn't reside, and I started to regret it. I lost a whole day to myself because I was just in a vegetative state. When I woke up the next day, I was so relieved because that slowness had subsided and I was myself again. I think it was the first time that I disliked that feeling, and I think that is a big step for me. So even though I slipped up, I'm not counting myself as on day one again. Because I did not lose all of the progress I had made, I simply solidified my stance on this decision.

2021-03-29 17:53:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mg0kyh/2_weeks_today/,2 Weeks Today,"For the first time in the last 3 years of my life, I have spent 2 full weeks completely sober from any and all forms of THC. Before the last 3 years, I spent 10 years taking small T Breaks no longer than 1 month at a time. Never really stopping, just smoking way less. I never planned on completely leaving my favorite leaf behind. I have had THC in my system, repetitively, mostly daily, for a very long time. 

In those last 3 years of addiction, I met some one new, fell in love with my new found best friend, and married her. I experienced great loss, and great gain. I moved.. 3 different times. I bought a motorcycle, and rebirthed a passion that had died for a long time. I got a second job pursuing a completely different passion of mine. I got a raise at my first job. I adopted a shelter dog. And I truly found who I was, and was happy with myself. 

Now, 2 weeks sober, with 0 THC in my body and going cold Turkey, I went through a week of hell, then a week of enlightenment and revelation.. I see my marriage in a completely different (good different) perspective now. One that I don’t ever want to be viewed through a “green” lens again. I see the motorcycle that has been sitting for almost a year. I see the dog poo in my yard. I see the drum kit gathering dust. I see the amount of raises and bonuses I missed because I was too high to give more than 2 shits at a time. I see the friendships I ruined from simply not being present. I see that when I felt I truly discovered who I was, and what I was happy with.. wasn’t true happiness. 

I was an addict, I was terrified of doing anything without my first love, Mary. I didn’t want to hang out at family events without smoking first. I didn’t want to go on a date without my pen. I didn’t want to play with my dog without loading up a bong or two first. Above all, I did not want to feel emotion, good or bad, without having THC in my system. I lived in a haze, all of the time, always with some sort of weed on me. A joint, a (way overpriced) Vaporizer, a cheap weed pen, always. A respectable smoker that hardly smelled of weed and always had a bottle of Visine Redness Relief... no one else knew I was high, no one ever smelled me, so I was okay. I wasn’t “that bad”. 

Quitting Cold Turkey taught me that I was that bad. The wave of emotions over the first week was truly a bitch to deal with. The cravings, oh god the cravings.. I had no idea that I had become as addicted as I had. Every time we went to leave the house, I found myself looking for a cartridge. Every time I got in bed, it felt weird not going through my ritual of packing a bong. Every morning I awoke, not taking that first hit of a freshly rolled joint with my coffee. It was a complete culture shift. 

And here I am, rambling senselessly on Reddit. I don’t know what point I’m trying to make. I don’t know what my goal is. I’m not looking for upvotes. I’m not looking for support, as I have found my support system. I guess I’m maybe looking for validation that I’m not the only person out here who thought they had life figured out... only to get sober and realize how wrong I was. Now I am happy. Now I can move forward. Now I can make progress. Now I can live the best life that I have in front of me. I have the world at my disposal. I don’t have to worry about running out of weed, I don’t have to worry about forgetting Visine or smelling like weed. 

This community has helped me get to this point, and I cannot be grateful enough. Thank you for validation. Thank you for support. Thank you for acknowledging the addictive and negative side of cannabis. For a plant so healthy and helpful, everyone seems to discredit the negatives and addictive side. It truly is a shame, because I absolutely believe in the power of medicinal marijuana in the correct context and situation. I’m looking forward to two months, then two years, then two decades as I truly believe the hardest part of this is behind me.

I was reluctant to let it go. How would I sleep? How would I keep myself company without it? My guitar playing and creativity would suffer if I quit, I reasoned. It was a part of who I was, I argued to myself. But I was wrong. Inspired by many of the excellent posts here, and tired, just tired of keeping on getting high, I took the plunge and quit.

At first it was rough. My sleep, already not great, did suffer. But only for a few days -- in a couple days it regained the low plateau, and now I'm sleeping more than I've been able to in years. 
At first, I was very sensitive to caffeine and cut way back and suffered painful headaches. But they subsided and now I'm able to feel stable with whatever caffeine. (Though I am addicted to caffeine and I'm pretty sure the headaches would resume unless I tapered slowly, but I've no desire to cut it out of my life.)

Longest I've gone without smoking is two months last summer. So much has happened in the last year in regards to my mental health; finally being diagnosed and dealing with the lowest point I've ever been in. By New Year's '21, I had taken the opportunity to start off the year sober and in a better state of mind. I was sober for all of January, and most of February. Until my long-term boyfriend and I broke up on the same day that a friend of mine passed away suddenly in a car accident.. she was 22 (I'm 23). Since then, I have been sad beyond belief. A new kind of sadness I have never experienced before. Lonely. And my sadness is triggering memories from the last time I felt something similar to this. So what do I do?

I smoke.

At first, it was 'helping me' (as an addict what does that really mean), and now it's too much. I don't have the income to uphold the habit, and it's making my lifestyle, in general, more difficult to do. I've spent an obnoxious amount of money on weed & food because of munchies. I went home to see my parents, away from weed and my only opportunity to be around people, and was sober for 4 days. Cried every day though because I am mourning the loss of two things at the same time. Every time I think I am getting better, I do something that tells me that I am not. 

I am so sad. But anyway, weed. I cannot stop smoking. **The only time I feel serious about not smoking and kicking this habit is when I am already high.** What turned into something I did just at night, just with friends, just once a day, has turned into an all-day thing. I thought going home and being away from it all would make things better, but coming back to the loneliness just hit harder almost. I'm at such a loss. I don't know if I want to quit, it's a weird feeling. But I know I should.. every day it's becoming less and less worth it. But the only reason I can type this right now is because I am high. I'll decide now that I won't smoke and make arrangements the next to make it difficult to contact my dealer.. only to unblock their number and go out of my way for the drug.

I was doing so well just two months ago. Dealing with a lot of shit, but doing it sober. Going to the gym. Watching what I ate. Now, it is just so difficult to care about things. I feel helpless. 

Didn't mean to make it this long, so:

TLDR; was sober for about two months before my friend passed away and my relationship ended on the same day. Now I am so sad and smoke all of the time, and the only time I seriously decide to stop smoking is when I am already high. Sober me makes some excuse to smoke again, and the cycle continues.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7962327}"

My friends and I we started smoking together like 3-4 years ago and I didn't tell them that I'm going sober now. So one of them passed me a J to light it.

I sat there, holding the joint in my hand, between my fingers, after 4 days of not smoking up, wondering if I should light it or not. Took me a good 15 mins before I passed it to my friend, got up, and went home.

I am about to go to sleep after 7 days of being sober, this is the longest I have not smoked for over a year, usually getting high again after 3 days. This time there has been zero white knuckling, I am pretty optimistic that just for today, I am out of the cycle and would like to share my thoughts on why this time is different.

1. I learnt about the how motivation and dopamine works in my brain, the next day when I wake up after smoking, it never stops me doing the things that are hard wired (Working out, shower, breakfast, tidy room, meal prepping for the day if needs be, etc etc). ANYTHING else, that required me to confront even a tiny amount of fear, was physically impossible because my dopamine system was so fucked that I could not muster the motivation to confront anything new.
2. ACCOUNTABILITY & HONESTY. Telling my father that despite now being clean off some other really destructive shit for just over 2 years ,that I was still smoking pot was one of the biggest fears I had to confront. His response brought me to tears. He told me a story about a friend in his work circle who found his son hanging from the roof in the garage one day and that his parents wished he could have said something. My dad said ""I am just glad you could be honest with me and I love you."" It doesn't fucking work to say that you are going to stop getting high and you will tell people about it later.
3. The danger of weed lies in the fact that it is not dangerous, so make it dangerous for yourself, I did this by telling my mother, who didn't mind me smoking pot, that I need random drug tests and that if I fail, I must be kicked out of the house.

Today, I was able to go to my best friends house to work, every single time I have gone to his house in the past, even when I really wanted to be clean, I have been so fucking triggered by him, or his house or whatever it was that I would end up grabbing a nug out of his jar and smoking and fucking hating myself. Now I could look at his jar and view it just like all the bottles in his house, its just an object, a substance that I don't want or need.

4. Last point, obviously I am projecting my own experience, but the withdrawals last as long as you believe they will, sure I occasionally wake up with some sweats, I can fly into a rage over nothing (I didn't get my electricity token immediately this morning so I couldn't make coffee) But you know what, I would rather feel that rage, recognize that I am being an asshole and calm myself down, instead of smoking myself into acceptance. within a few days I was able to start dreaming again ( I had a nightmare that I was murdered by the mob, but I woke up smiling because it means glorious REM sleep is back.

Just for today, its different, I am so grateful for this community, I read these posts every morning and draw so much strength from you all. If anyone out there is struggling and needs a friend or someone to talk to, please message me.

It's comforting to find a community of people who are going through or have gone through this. 

I have a history with weed abuse, and I was sober for a couple years before the pandemic completely destroyed my progress. I probably won't go further into my history in this post because the present situation is more pressing. 

**What's the situation?** I'm taking online classes (biochemistry and physics with lab, so not a crazy course load, but they really do require my focus), but I can't stay sober for even a few days, and *this isn't going well for me*. I'm waking up and finding missed assignments, I'm skipping lectures, and I'm having trouble just simply making myself sit down and learn the material (quick sobbing interlude about how much I hate online school). I'm *barely* scraping by. And I HAVE to pass these classes with at least a B-. 

I'm going to vet school in the fall and I hate the idea that I'll be so fresh off of a ten-month bender.  I'm terrified of ruining this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

**Why do I smoke?** I live alone, my family is 1,000 miles away, I don't have a ton of friends, and a lot of the time it feels like there's not a whole lot else for me to do except smoke weed and sit on my phone. 

Last time I quit, I concluded that building up my life was key. I built a life that required the sober version of myself to be available at all times. It worked well for a while, but then the pandemic happened. And now I just sit here, high and alone. Day in day out. 

**What's my plan?** I'm working on forming new friendships, which is hard right now, but I think I've finally found someone who I can spend some time with. I don't know if that's enough, but it's something. I'm also moving in the summer, and I'll be getting some roommates who are also my classmates. I have high hopes that this will also be super helpful. I think that constant social pressure will help me stay sober. And also never doing online school or work again. 

**Concluding remarks.** I want to stop right now. I want to be sober, *right now*. I want to be sober today, and all week, and for the rest of my life. I just can't seem to resist those momentary whims. I can't even go to the grocery store without stopping by a dispensary on the way home! And I literally have three more joints *in my home* rn because these fking dispensaries have these fking bargains, so when I indulge a single momentary whim I end up blasted for DAYS. 

This sucks. 

I really want to smoke right now. 

**P.S.** Oh, and I also have a biochemistry midterm Wednesday that I've hardly studied for, plus a physics midterm Thursday that I *absolutely* have not studied for. I desperately, DESPERATELY need to be sober. But I still really want to smoke. Right now.",2,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5028718}"

Trigger warning: suicide

As a writer, artist and musician, I spent almost 20 years as a very functional chronic smoker. I worked as a chef and all my friends were people in the same circles. Not only did my addiction tell me that a pot smoker was a legitimate part of who I am, but it actually made me a better person. I was able to go with the flow, didn't take life too seriously and was always working on something.

I was sure that pot helped in all aspects of my life. It was social, creative and I was v chill. But time slipped, years went by, and without even knowing it, I was smoking just to feel normal, just to wake up, just to function. I was self isolating because I couldnt relax until I was away from everyone getting high to feel right. I was diagnosed with several mental disorders and put on medications, so I tried to get right by quitting cigs and drinking, but didn't want to give up weed. It ""helped"" too much.

When the pandemic hit, I started smoking all day everyday, was making a lot of art and music and figured my anti social tendencies were perfect for the times... and all that heavy sadness and depression I felt, well, that's just me.

I knew I was smoking too much... I even tried breaks or quitting, telling friends and loved ones, but also shrugging it off when I would relapse. I felt sure that one day I would be able to have just that one joint when playing music, or on the weekend, or while drawing, because I'll be damned if being high didn't still ""work"" if I used responsibly. 

At the start of this year, my cousin committed suicide. He and I were very similar. It shook me. It made me reevaluate what I was doing, how I was doing, and what I actually wanted.

6 days sober, and I know for certain that my marijuana use was contributing to my depression. I wasn't proud of who I had become. The illusion was broken for me.

I can't speak for anyone else, but for me marijuana was my drug of choice and the hardest substance to put down. I don't believe I can be a casual smoker ever, which I now accept. I'm ready to move on, to heal and to reintroduce myself to myself.

Above all, I want to be there for others who are going through the worst of it.

I wonder how it will feel to pursue my creative interests sober, but I am no longer afraid that I will be unable to create without weed.

I’m certainly not naive enough to say that I am out of the dog house or that I’ll never smoke again, but I’ll continue to take it one day at a time and remind myself of why I am doing this. This is a long read...my bad.

Weed has been a crutch in my life since I was in high school, I started smoking daily when I was fifteen and by the time I was twenty it had consumed almost every aspect of my life. Like many others out there, I used to love smoking, it used to be a social activity, it used to bring me joy and enhance the activities that I engaged in; or at least that’s what I think I remember. I’m 29 now.

Since at least 2015, I have smoked almost exclusively by myself. I have left social events to go home and smoke alone. I have smoked far more than any of my smoking friends, something I really can’t quantify, but I know it has pushed me away from these people. Smoking became more important than my friends, my job, my hobbies. I risked on a daily basis, my dream job since I was 10, by smoking at work. I smoked so much I went from a confident, competent person to losing all confidence in my ability to do anything. I lost any ability to deal with my emotions, anxiety, and depression. I smoked so much weed, that I drove myself away from the job I always dreamed I would have, because I eventually thought the job was the problem, not the weed. I really felt like I was going insane...

The worst part is I always knew that things could be better if I didn’t smoke. I spent about 3 years telling myself I would quit, but never really tried, and never really gave myself a good chance. It would always be once I finished smoking my stash, sometimes I’d make it a day, sometimes two, then I’d buy myself another few weeks supply and the cycle would start again, and again, and again.

Things became really bad in the last 3 years, primarily as my access grew at dispensaries in Canada, through online ordering, and especially since I started exclusively smoking concentrates. As my intake increased, so did my stress, anxiety, and general delusional world view. I have blamed so many others for my own problems for far too long. Enough is enough.

The last time I smoked was the night before the Super Bowl, I’m not a particularly big football fan, but I remember the day, because I watched the game sober. I certainly didn’t intend to quit, but I made it a day, then two, then I decided to really go for it. The last few years, I have wasted a considerable amount of my hard earned savings, and I think that has been my biggest motivator. At a point, I just stopped caring how much I was spending. I would cut back on other things in life so I could support my habit. I’ve been trying to go through my records to really nail down how much I’ve spent over the years, not so I can get down on myself, but so I can quantify another thing weed has taken from me.

I am now working on reclaiming the joy in my life and rekindling the things I cherished before I lost my head. It hasn’t gotten better just because I’ve stopped smoking, but I do feel much more capable of taking the steps I need to make it so. I’m reaching out to friends I’ve lost touch with. I’ve started on a new career path in a trade that I respect and enjoy. I’ve committed myself to good self care, or at least I’m trying. It’s been tough, but I feel very lucky to have a job I enjoy and people that are still interested in hearing from me after so long. One thing I’ve learned is that I care much more about the mistakes of my past, than other people do. Most are just happy to see me back on the right path.

I wrote this really just to document my journey, and I think I’ll try to do it again at 100 days, if I make it there. I don’t really feel qualified to give any advice, but all I can say with certainty is when I was smoking I never thought this would be possible. 50 days or writing something like this. All it took was giving myself a real chance at success. 1 day, then 2, and each day after that. The withdrawal was wicked at first, and continued for some time, but I am starting to feel human again. Now it’s just about changing my habits going forward.

Thanks to everyone who posts and comments on this subreddit, it’s been a huge help in my recovery. All my best to everyone, wherever you are in the process.

I took my phone to the pool on a beautiful day to write this. 

I am extremely happy that I feel like I have broken the ridiculous loop that I had stayed in for 20 years, 5 quite crap. 

I am super confident at the moment about going in this direction. It is my 37th birthday next month and I know for sure that I am going to be THC free completely on that date. 

I have wanted to seriously quit every day of the past year. I was terrible at always giving myself one more day every day before making the decision stick. The worst being when I smoked 1 gram along with a cookie and multiple cart hits and then felt a tiny buzz. I felt down thinking how much Id consumed and at the samr time realising it is not even working for me. In those weeks/months building up to that day I felt like O was withdrawing before withdrawing. Id often call up my dealer and complain that it was poor stuff or ask to find something stronger. I was a sick note basically. 

 I felt down when I picked up a 7 year old notebook and read that Id set several quit dates in 1 year.

So I eventually quit...

The hardest part for me was throwing stuff away only to get more that night. Had a few nights rummaging through the bins too contemplating smoking rubbish wet weed. Crazy now when i think about it. 

It is all about the mindset I believe. 

Here is what ive learned;

- smoking weed was never fun once i realised that I needed to quit. 
- i have always been a rapper and produced good content but I can write better stuff in an hour now than I did in a week. I cant smoke and enjoy it fully at the same time. I think thats the main reason keeping me away from it now. 
- I am not an insomniac for life. I am sleeping so well now.
- i can have a piece of cake and stop without eating the whole thing. 
- quitting gets easier everytime for me. You shouldnt hold expectations as to how bad it will be..youre better prepared everytime if you learnt from the last. 
- i am finally dealing with some relationship problems. They were always there. Some changes in my personality require patience from my partner. She had 2 years of me being a certain way about things. Takes time for her to trust me again. 
- i am funny again. Im making everyone laugh. Its a really big deal.
- there arent enough hours in the day for things i love.
- im making lots of improvements that i half arsed thought about before..like im aerobic fit now , reading a lot, eliminating caffeine. Little things seem daunting when high.
- i like looking at myself in the mirror now. Some child like quality. 

This last one is a bit weird because i only amoked at night time. 

I can still have that trip like feeling sinking into my bed. Thats what i really enjoyed with music. Im still doing it but naturally. Just these days im naturally sleepy and blissful..

The nightmares are subsiding which is great. Its all about good sleep for creativity in my opinion. Thats whats really important to me now. I choose a highloght every day. 

Im recording 2 songs tomorrow and actually looking forward to it

Happy days

Thank you everyone here. Ive been reading your inspiration instead of zonking out. 

Peace

I smoked before exercise, painting, work, sewing, sex, gardening, before and after dinner, in the middle of the night, in the morning, climbing, running, etc. Hell, would smoke before smoking. Today I’ve made it four days without and now I cannot stop crying.","Hello internet stranger friends.  I have been embarrassed to tell you all—how long it has been. The truth is for about 36 years with three one year breaks during that time period.  And when I quit before, “friends” and my ex wanted me to start again. I guess I wasn’t as fun as a non stoner.  But I remember life before pot and I was fine. And I was funny.

I had been ramping up to quit and then I found this Reddit feed and reading all the posts  has given me the strength to stop. I don’t want to start again. 


But now I remember all the memories I have been hiding from all these years. I quit drinking 18 months ago and now I am quitting this and all the memories and things that were done to me and things that I have done have come flooding back. 

I’m sad that I have been a stoner parent. I am all the sudden extremely depressed about my divorce. Which was 11 years ago and he was seriously abusive and I was lucky to get out but I feel horrible about how my children suffered because of it. 

I keep telling myself I want to experience my suffering raw.  So I will not pick up the pipe. I am committed. I want to know who I am without it. I want my sons to know me that way too. 

I live in Boulder, CO.  I went to the grocery store today and there was an armed security guard. I said “You’re new here.” He told me he was transferred there from a daycare center (yes you read that right. They now require armed guards at local daycare)  because there was a copy cat shooter that tried to go into that store and when stopped, he drove off and went to two other stores before they caught him. The bright side of this is the fact that I actually talked to the security guard.  Normally I would have been stoned and paranoid and would have avoided any interaction with people. 

I was on my way to the king Soopers when the shooting happened. I was supposed to leave for the store at three but I had a mechanical issue with my sewing machine so I took time to fix it and left at 3:15.  The shooting was at 3:22. I saw that crumpled guy in the parking lot. This whole deal has really affected me. And I think it is adding to this overwhelming  feeling of sadness.  
Plus covid loneliness. 

I’m trying to think positive. Good things have happened since I quit. Actually, I have been doing really well until today. 

I started CrossFit again last week  and I have already made three friends. Last time I was taking classes there for two years (pre covid), I never met one person. I would come in at the nick of time and leave during stretching at the end so I wouldn’t have to talk to anyone. What the fuck was I thinking?  It is much more fun this way. 

I have more energy. My normal mid afternoon slump has not happened, I have not been napping, even though my sleep is hit or miss. I know I will start dreaming again and I look forward to that. 



My Haribo gummy bear consumption is down 95 percent. You may want to divest any stock you have in Haribo. 

I’m surprised and pleased at how quickly my antisocial traits stopped once I stopped weed. 

So I got that going for me, which is nice. 

I know this too shall pass and it will all work out or I will die and then it will be worked out that way. 

I’m sorry if I sound whiny but I need to get this out and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this who understands the enormity of quitting and the myriad of things we go through when becoming WF. Weed Free. 

I look forward to reading more of your posts. You  good people have inspired and helped me on this new path.

- my anxiety and depression are down like 90% since I’ve been sober
- it just keeps getting better, withdrawals lasted about 30 days and I’m still slowly getting better and better. 
- the keys to my success were MA meetings, posting here often, and getting a day tracker. Getting involved in community is key
- I don’t ever want to smoke again. Not even just “once to celebrate” or “in special circumstances”. I’m just done. Life sober is so much better in every way.
- alcohol is bullshit too, it didn’t work for me to replace weed with alcohol. 
- taking away bad habits is half the battle, doing daily meditation and yoga have helped my journey so much.

(weed is definitely the more challenging one for me) I feel strong and good today so I decided it's the time to officially quit. I've tried to quit in the past and always end up going back around the one month mark, thinking I've got it in control, thinking just a little bit won't hurt. this always morphs back into daily use. I also notice that more trauma starts to resurface around this time, centering around things I experienced as a teenager. (anger issues, sexual abuse, family issues) . I feel like if i want to move forward in my life, I really need to deal with this stuff w/o the bandaid. I've been smoking everyday since I was 15, and I'm about to turn 25. the 10 year mark is hitting me hard. I refuse to be stuck like this for the next 10. While I've had those occasional short breaks, I literally don't know who i am or what I'm capable of longterm, without weed. I'm really excited to find out. 

Substance abuse is a big theme in my family, my parents and their parents really struggle with alcoholism. While i don't drink more than a few times a week, I've always struggled with moderation. Once I start it's hard to stop (the same issue I experience with weed). I don't like who i become when i drink, and i hate how my body feels afterwords. i used to suffer from lymes and autoimmune issues, so over time I've learned to eat extremely well and take great care of my body. thankfully I've experienced so much healing, but drinking just feels like such a pointless step in the wrong direction. 80% of the time leaves me feeling inflamed and terrible. 

I'm really excited for this journey, I'm ready to break the family line of abuse. I'm looking forward to the clarity, energy, memory enhancement and overall sense of empowerment. I've noticed over the past few years that whenever I met someone who was sober, i always felt this sense of amazement, inspiration, and respect. followed by tinges of jealousy, because deep down I know that's what i want. welp, I'm finally doing it!!!

By far my longest clean stretch since I became an every day smoker about 11 years ago. My first real test last was night when I had a group of friends over to my house to watch the UFC fights (all of whom smoke). They all know I've quit and are very respectful about it, but asked if they could smoke joints during the fight and I said ""of course."" We all had a good time, they smoked and I just passed every time someone accidentally tried to pass the joint to me.

I think one of the big things we all have to remember is it's going to be impossible to completely remove weed from our lives. I know you may feel like you have to avoid the presence of weed to avoid temptations, but I think the key is to know that weed is always going to be there, and mentally realize that you're just going to have to be strong and disciplined in terms of saying no. I never want to shut people out because they smoke, or avoid spending time with them because weed is going to be present. Would it be easier if it just wasn't there? Of course. But in our lifetimes, weed is only going to get more and more mainstream, and we all have to realize that, embrace that fact, and be secure with our choices and our sobriety. I felt a ton of pride being among smokers and having the discipline to say no, and I think all my friends were impressed as well. It was a non-issue and we all had a blast despite the fact that I was sober. If anything, I was pumped to be around smokers because I miss the camaraderie (and that sweet sweet smell), but I didn't feel the temptation to get high and just felt fine feeding off their energy. No contact high whatsoever, just tons of laughs. Remember, no one else cares if you pass the J, only you care.

I had to go cold turkey. I have never gone back but I discovered my energy is way higher and my head seems much clearer than before. Sadly the anxiety has persisted but at least I am not making it worse by smoking. I’ve mentioned this to plenty of friends and just hear “you’re not smoking the right strain bro” and I feel like I’m not adequately listened to.

Withdrawal symptoms were intense for the first week, with cold sweats, body twitches and anxiety but definitely manageable.

It still hurts, but being able to think about it sober and just be sad about it instead of triggering a panic attack or disassociation spell is... strangely healthy. Almost disconcerting.

I say strangely because we've dulled our ability to process and heal from emotional trauma through weed for so long that when it finally starts to happen it seems easy in comparison to hiding behind that fog. To be clear, it doesn't suddenly make it a walk in the park, but sobriety allows proper processing and growth even if it's happening years after the fact. Weed does not.

Feb: Slowly starting to put a new life together 

March: Moving too fast, forgetting how fragile I could be, being hard on myself about other stuff, and ending the month remembering I’m still better off, my problems now are good problems to have, and to be proud of myself and go back to taking things slower :)

Good luck wherever you are in your journey.

When I first discovered this sub a couple of years ago I was a daily bong smoker who could only dream of quitting or even restricting my intake. I dumped my bong two years ago and sticked to smoking joints, still on a daily basis though.     
      
I really thought I was never gonna fully quit, until my boyfriend had to have surgery and wanted to quit for a couple of weeks prior because he heard some horrific stories about anesthesia not working as planned when you're a daily smoker.      
Out of solidarity I took the chance and stopped smoking, too.     
     
And I sticked to it! He's back at smoking a couple of joints on weekends because he still enjoys it, but I realized that I really don't need weed/getting high in my life anymore.     
    
I thought it would be impossible to quit when you have a partner that still smokes, but honestly it's not tough at all. I am so glad that I finally took that step and stopped completely, even though I planned on toking occasionally on weekends or when I'm with friends. Turns out, the urge to get high is completely gone! And I'm feeling sooo good about it!",14,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7551572}"

Now, I’m not sure that I will, but it was enough of a sign to know that enough is enough. 

I quit smoking cigarettes more than a year ago, but honestly I just replaced it with smoking weed. And do you want to know the truth? It doesn’t add anything to my life. I get bored, and I want to smoke instead of start a new project or finish something or be productive. I smoke before I eat, before I sleep, when I get home from work, all day while working from home. I chew through it so so fast and the stupid thing is, I don’t even really get high. Just a mild buzz and... it’s not worth it. 

I’ve tried stopping so many times. The problem is I’m stubborn- I make things up in my head to justify it. It’s a pain killer to help with my migraines. It stops me from feeling nauseous when I eat. It helps my insomnia. But the truth? I got along just fine before weed, and I can do better without. Heck, I’ve literally just gone to the doctor to start beating my migraines once and for all. 

I don’t know how much of a difference stopping will make. I’m hoping it gives me the motivation to find the girl who I lost years ago, who thought feeling nothing was better than feeling everything. She’s been squashed, screaming to get out. To do something. To live a life worth living. And I think it’s time to take the shackles off.

I've been a daily smoker for about 6 years, taking breaks here and there. but I can't even remember when my last break was to be honest. I went ~36 hours recently without smoking and I realized that's probably the longest I've gone in at least two years.

But this past year. Fuck, I was buying an ounce every 2-3 weeks. and sometimes running out in between. I was smoking all day. I was at a job where I could get away with it easily. also, when you smoke that much, you learn how to function and I thought I was functioning pretty well.

I admit now I wasn't.

like many, I started smoking in college. it was after I graduated and started working in a café that I started smoking more. I had a 40 minute walk to work, leaving at 6am. I would smoke a bowl, enjoy the morning, and be mellow but functional at work. 

oh, I also have suffered with depression (now dysthymia) for almost my whole life, and developed anxiety and pure O in teenhood (which both greatly contributed. to my agoraphobia) Cannabis helped so so much. it made college a lot more fun for me, it helped me get out of my shell and find supportive friends. 

I was also unmedicated during college and early twenties. I'm now almost 30, and have found a wonderful anti-depressants that I've been on for 4 years. I recently reduced the dose and feel even better. 

I recently moved in with my partner, who doesn't smoke but also doesn't mind me smoking. I work from home while they have to go in person. I've cut down drastically since I started the WFH job in the end of last year, but now moving in with them, I feel like I'm hiding it from them. I don't smoke in the house and usually smoke while they're at work, and it's like a lie by omission. but even that makes me feel guilty. my partner dislikes weed for themself but it just makes me feel bad when I'm around them stoned.

and I'm realizing I don't like who I am when I smoke. I'm numb and dumb and don't have to worry about things because hey, I'm stoned. 

this WFH job is my first real adult job in a field I want to be in, and I'm realizing how much else I want to do with my life, with my career. and how sitting around stoned watching YouTube videos seriously does not help that at all.

so I'm done. I don't want cannabis in our home. I want to have hobbies and interests and contribute thoughtfully to the conversation. my relationship before this one, he was a big smoker too and we'd spend our time together stoned and watching YouTube videos but really nothing else. this current relationship hasn't been that at all and I don't want it to be.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38417423}"

""randomly determined; having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.""

And this far in, I have determined 'stochastic' is the best word I can find to describe coming down off of weed.  

I have smoked weed every night since July 4 2014 and also took tinctures, edibles, combined it with nicotine and liquor on the weekends, etc.  Weed was my respite. My solace.  The ONE thing I could look forward to everyday that would give me relief from the anxiety and tension of the day.  It was my best friend, my family, my lover.  

Coming down off of it has been, well, awful.  Sweats.  Chills.  Insomnia.  Body aches.  Headaches.  And by far the worst part is the depression, apathy, and short fuse.  There are days that I feel like ""I got this.  The worst part is over -- it's all lollipops and daisies from here on out.""  WRONG.

Yesterday I felt good, strong and clear.  Today, I can literally feel my heart beat in my chest and I have to remind myself to breathe.  I can feel the blood in my veins and the gray vail coming down over my brain that screams ""you are not qualified to write that paper you must write today.""  I want to recoil and hide but I don't know where to hide because there is no escape.  My respite is gone.

I have NO idea what later today will bring or tomorrow or the next day.  As much as I love to forecast, plan, prepare, and mitigate, there is NO plan. The ambiguity is torture at times.  Feeling good feels like a trick.

But I will not give up.  I keep telling myself to trust the wisdom of my body.  I read these threads like the gospel.

I have 4 foster rabbits that I’m socializing which does help occupy my time, but I just feel so restless and bored.
Unfortunately I can’t really channel this energy into exercise like I would like, been dealing with debilitating back spasms which I need to rest. (I’m terrible at taking it easy and always push myself too soon )  

I’ve mostly grown out of video games, even when I was smoking.

It's weird not to finish work and put on my favourite show while I roll a joint. I am slow, so it usually takes me a sitcom's worth to finish rolling. 

It's weird to not have anything to do with my hands. I still vape, and have an occasional cigarette in my study. But the act of rolling was oddly relaxing. 

Yet...

Horrifying to imagine how many hours I put into just rolling a damn j. Horrifying to remember that sometimes I skipped out on social or family events just so I could smoke alone at home, with my husband gone. 

Horrifying to remember that I would make my husband wait for me in the bedroom while I painstakingly rolled an extra long j *(the weekend j)* to last me the whole of Saturday night. I would take my time with it, and then take my time smoking it. I left the poor guy for so long, and then I'd wonder why he was mad at me *(too stoned to realise)*. 

Last year when I didn't have a job, I would wait for my husband to go to sleep, and then slip out of bed to roll a j or two (while watching Gossip Girl). Then I would play Sims right up until 4am. Get up the next day at 11 or 12 and do the same thing all over again. 

The worse thing was waiting to be caught. It was as if I wanted to get caught. I waited everyday for my husband to come out and pee, or to come find me in those wee hours of the night. I would imagine him throwing me out of the house, or not speaking to me for several days. But the funny thing is he never did. I was probably a bit disappointed because I had already wanted to quit then. Just didn't gather up my balls and do it. 

Eventually I got bolder, and started smoking in the daytime, when I started getting some freelance work. I'd wake up earlier so I would have to face the stressors of the day earlier. By 6pm, I would make an excuse to lock my study door and there I would go, rolling a j. And another, and another, and another. He finally did catch me. 

**My habits almost cost me my marriage.** Even when I knew this at the back of my head, I was unable to quit. It took about two months of couple's therapy and hearing my husband tell his side of the story for me to truly wake up. Being sober on that couch and hearing the anguish in his voice, yet at the same time understanding that he was trying his best to accept me and my ways, finally shook me upside down. 

Here is this man who truly loves me, despite my flaws. And there I was, busy throwing our relationship away. 

Yes, we had other problems of course. We are two very different people, but the weed made it worse, no doubt. Being locked down together during the pandemic was like being in a pressure cooker. Everythingggggg came out. We saw each other in our ugliest moments. No holds barred. He saw me at my worse. 

We were separated for three months and out of those three months, I smoked for the first two because I couldn't bear the pain. I did everything to try to heal myself - went on a solo trip, journaled, started exercising, but I just couldn't let go of my mean, green friend. 

We had so many arguments about me smoking after we got married. I *'fought'* for my right to smoke, saying I preferred it over drinks. Arguing that it was cheaper even and that I didn't wake up with a hangover. 

We met 10 years ago and it was around the same time we got together that I actually started smoking weed. I was going through a very tough time, my dad had cancer and I had to return from overseas. I had had different plans with my life, and to be back in my hometown and having to throw away all those dreams was a slap in the face. Looking back however, if I had not come back home, I would not have gotten together with my now-husband. *Everything happens for a reason.* 

So it could have been argued that he knew what he was getting into when we got married four years ago. He secretly thought I would outgrow it and now I understand that he saw me as more than just a stoner. He saw me beyond all of that. He knew I was better than my constant smoking. 

Over the last 10 years, he's been with me. Through at least two really bad panic attacks, through dumb, irresponsible shit that I did. Through bouts of quitting that never really lasted. Last year, when we separated, it was the final straw for him. Because we were fighting so much and I didn't know how to deal, I was just smoking all day everyday to numb the pain. I was forever using weed to numb out my anger, my sadness, my frustrations. No doubt that I was abusing the plant. He couldn't take it anymore. 

Yet, here we are, together again - my husband and I patched up and I am back at our condo. And here I am, on Day 22 of sobriety. I am so grateful that he's still here. I am grateful that he held onto his vision for me - even after all these years. He always reminded me that I was more than this. And finally, god-damn-finally, I see his point. I've had to put away my ego and my pride *(and my stash)* to admit that he was right. But I did it. 

That is what I'm holding onto. I am more than Ms. Pothead. I am more than a stoner. I am someone who can enjoy life sober. I love music, novels, being out in Nature. I love travelling, and am saving up to go somewhere when we can travel again. 

I was always afraid to take the next step in life. I do believe weed was one of the factors in holding me back, not just in my marriage, but in my career too. Now, I am still afraid, but I am ready. 

**I want to remind you that you are more than that person who smokes up. You are more than your habits. You are more than the substance abuse.**

The stress didn't bother me while I was at work and I was able to float by the rest of the day. I did feel bad about ending my sobriety, but I was in a real ""fuck it"" type mood.

Next day comes and I feel like shit. Decide to have a wake and bake. Felt great again but still had that ""wtf are you doing?"" voice going on in my head too. I ended up repeating the cycle and brought the cart to work again, smoked even more and spent the entire shift rather faded. Then I realized I was back in my cycle all over again which couldn't have come at a worse time because the dream job I've been after now wants to have me on within the next few months.

And now here I am, avoiding the connections I do have, just to get high. 

I’ve been high over 1,000 times, and every single time, it’s always the same disappointing 30 minute high. But apparently that’s better than a natural dopamine rush from another human being. Disappointed in myself, but hopefully it’ll be different this time. 

Just needed to vent I guess. I’m aiming for 2 weeks sober. 13 more days 🤞🏾

Well, I credit it to understanding our desire for pain. We identify with being “addicted” and then our subconscious mind takes over. You know those times where you don’t even consciously choose to get high, but 5 minutes later you find yourself lighting up a joint or digesting an edible? That’s because you didn’t even decide to do it! You’re letting your habits and your mind run on autopilot in order to not consciously deal with your problems— or not deal with your addiction. 

After I looked into the work of Eckhart Tolle, I understood my desire to be a victim a lot better, my desire to just let my brain’s ingrained habits to make me continue smoking weed. 

If you start being literally more conscious of your actions and YOU begin CHOOSING them, not letting your MIND CHOOSE them, you will find sobriety. 

After kicking yourself up for addiction in the past, your mind has begun to actually embrace your addiction. To need it, because it’s become a part of you. Become more aware of your thought patterns and it will really help you quit. It did for me at least.

I went to a fine foods store tonight to treat my sober self to some good locally made chocolate and a well-crafted sandwich. I ate half of the already-small sandwich and a few blips (nips?? what are they called) of the chocolate bar and I am beyond full. I am going to drink a seltzer water and go to bed now. 

I cannot help but notice that if this were a few weeks ago when I was still smoking, I would have absolutely demolished that sandwich, eaten the entire chocolate bar, and then maybe run to the gas station for some more snacks.

I used to go to the grocery store 2-3 extra times per week so that I could make sure I had a gallon of milk and a giant pack of cookies to snack on every night while I was baked out of my mind (actually just foggy and paranoid as my tolerance was so high). I used to order food from doordash as a ""first dinner"" and then make a second dinner to wash that one down. 

I got a pack of tortilla chips and some salsa at the store tonight too, and after I worked out (something I would have never done while high) I had a few chips - probably about 5 - before I was full. A package of tortilla chips used to be gone in one snacking session. Maybe I would have a few left over. 

I have not been to the grocery store in over a week now and I have plenty of food to last me. In fact, the last gallon of milk I bought is sitting in my fridge expired waiting to be thrown out because I don't have some otherworldly craving for cookies and milk like I am some kind of sweets goblin. 

As we all know, there are so many benefits to the /r/leaves lifestyle, but holy shit the amount of food I used to eat was disgusting. Like I said, it's only been a few weeks and between sobering up and working out, I bet I have lost at least 5lbs if not more. 

I never was an out-of-shape fat person, but smoking marijuana in the disgusting amounts that I did made me into one over time. I was fit my entire life until here and now in my mid-20's with a giant gut from smoking a stupid plant. 

Sorry for the rant. I hope you all are eating a nice delicious snack tonight...in moderation.

2021-03-16 21:12:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/m6ohqi/quitting_for_my_son/,Quitting for my son,"I am posting here to help keep myself accountable as I start on the path to living weed free. I was a daily smoker for the last 14 years. I started smoking heavily around age 18, and quickly made weed a big part of my identity. I had always considered weed to be harmless and beneficial for my mental health and sleep patterns. I have spent years proselytizing about the benefits of weed, but my eyes are slowly opening after a long and hazy decade.  

My wife and I recently welcomed our son to the world. I have slowly accepted that being fully present in my son's life and smoking just do not mix. I haven't been a bad dad, but I know I can do better. I don't want to shorten the amount of time I have with my boy, and I don't want my son to grow up thinking dad is a burnout, or remembering the smell of weed when he thinks back. I want my weekend to be full of activity and adventure, not sitting around the house. Being present with my son takes priority over some stupid flower.

I am the breadwinner for my family, and I have a job that has zero tolerance for weed use. A single hot piss test could end my career and leave my family without an income. Until last week, I had told myself that having a medical card made smoking okay, but I always knew I was one random screen away from disaster. I have finally  accepted that it's time to grow up and leave weed behind. 

Last Friday, I went to my dispensary to get my ""medicine."" The store was full of the usual suspects, and I watched several folks have complete meltdowns because a discount strain was not in stock. Watching adults flipping out over access to 10 strains instead of 11 was an eye opener, and helped me see that weed is no different than any other drug. I never want to give a substance the power to control my emotions, so I vowed I would quit the next day. 

Saturday morning came, and I instinctively ripped my rig at sunrise, completely ignoring my promise to myself from the night before. I've done this too many times to count, but the shame felt different when I saw my son that morning. He deserves a dad that gives 100%, and not a dad sliding and middling through the day. I finally knew I wanted to make the change for someone other than myself, and that realization hits different. 

On Sunday, I smoked the last of my stash, and in a moment of forced clarity, I smashed my bong and started scrolling through this sub to get motivated. Many of your posts help me accept that I was in for a rough couple weeks of adapting to life without my crutch, but I finally knew it was time to cut the bullshit, and that I was not alone struggling with breaking free from a ""harmless medicine.""

The first 2 days of sobriety have been hellacious, I never fully understood how deeply dependent I had become. My appetite is gone, I can't sleep, my fight or flight response seems to be triggering non stop, I'm anxious, and all I want to do is throw some crumble in my rig and relax, but I can't and I won't. I will learn to deal with the discomfort, and I will thrive eventually.

Here's to another night headed in the right direction, and to hoping tomorrow is a little easier. To anyone on the fence about quitting who is a parent, it's never too late to do something life-changing for your kid.",30,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45307562}"

I just wanted to make a post because a lot of these posts have helped me get through quitting, and I figured it might help someone. 

For reference, I was a very heavy dabber, and I dabbed 5-7 times on an average day. This has went on for around 2 years, and I smoked flower everyday for 2 years before switching to dabs. I guess a total of 4-5 years using. 4 years daily. 

My last day smoking was last Sunday, and I have had a ton of withdrawl symtoms. The first day was actually easy, excluding the insomnia, but it has been all downhill from there. 

My anixety has never been horrible, but I have actually been brought to tears a few times within the last week. (I very rarely cry). It's been rough. I have went to the doctor once, and the ER once as well. My BP was extremely high, and my heart rate has been 80-90 when it is usually 60-70. I have been getting tired easier when doing any physical activity. I have become a mini hypochondriac, and have convinced myself I have numerous serious problems due to this withdrawal. It has been hard to convince myself it isn't that. 

My digestion has been very rough. I haven't been able to comfortably eat, or go to the bathroom. I also just don't feel... right. Almost lightheaded off and on all day. 

I hear that 2 weeks is typically the tipping point, I hope thats true! This hasn't been easy.

The last time this happened is prolly more than 10 years ago. I tried several times to quit over the last few years but I always relapsed. It got easier though. I learned what kind of symptoms are waiting for me and that I can't smoke at all because I'd always fall back in a 24/7.
I also found a really helpful app: Quit weed.
It tracks your progress and gives you certain health Archievements which is very motivating.
Additionally I found a new hobby, which gives me some distraction. Got really invested in cryptocurrency. You might even wanna call it a new addiction 😂.
Here are the positive effects I noticed from the abstinence:
- better interaction with fellow humans
- motivation is coming back
- sharper mind
- more confidence
- feeling healthier
- more time

I dont even smoke as soon as i get home anymore. i try to hold myself off and get anxious at the fact that i want it so badly. Angry with myself for the craving to be there at all, and to have fallen victim to it time and time again, so much so that I havent even enjoyed my highs while sticking to them like glue. wishing I could rip myself away. I’m fully aware of how dependent I am and I need to remove it as a necessity from my life. the hardest part about quitting is that I know I should, but I wish I didnt have to. I wish i could use it sparingly, without guilt and without shame, but its like a Spiteful act every time I pack a bowl. eventually i get comfortable getting spiteful. thats not an attitude I want to engross myself in. 

i dont want to disappoint myself anymore. i thought i didnt want to disappoint my boyfriend but I have, and his virtual acceptance of my lack of willpower is soul crushing. and no amount of promises or recognition of my mistakes will do anything- I have to do something, for myself, to change anything else. But I’m scared. I know its gonna be difficult. I dont want to tell him with pride about the days going by that I havent smoked, because Ive lied about it before and taken his pride for granted. I need to be proud of myself, I ache for it. then I can show him the results of something I worked for, for both of us but for myself first. 

im afraid that im gonna give up when the pressure of my mind tells me i can easily just smoke again and get rid of whatever im feeling in the moment. that my inner voice will tell me its simply easy to lie and keep my habits to myself and no one will expect any different anyway, so keep to ur same old bullshit. Im tired of falling into traps emotionally, keeping myself down and weak and complacent. telling myself that being stoned is better than feeling bored, or lonely, or angry. 

i ran out two days ago, sunk into my kief supply last night as the final hurrah, and im feeling better but still anxious about not having anything to get me thru tonight. i know theres nothing left in my grinder but my addict brain is trying to compel me to check.. “just check.. if theres anything left..” but i refuse to get up. im gonna play on my switch instead. hopefully forget about it, but consciously deciding not to check at all feels good right now.

You know you’re poor when you don’t go to ER because you can’t afford it. If I was middle class I would’ve gone to ER when I was freaking out but I was like “meh, too expensive”. Even though I was going to kms. I was like “you better not mess up if you do it, because the hospital and ER are expensive” I can’t even have a fucking breakdown in peace. Lol, that’s kind of amusing, isn’t it? But yes, that’s why I relapsed. I didn’t know how to cope.

But yea, I can’t deal with this stress so I keep relapsing and starting over. It lets me go into denial mode for a moment. Then, I gather the energy to start over with my sobriety which is really good, but I can’t just relapse every time I have extreme stress. I cannot afford to have a substance abuse problem.

It’s been 10 days without weed and I feel a bit down this evening. I’m posting here to motivate myself and to share my experience until now.

The best thing happening in these past 10 days is definitely the “brainfog” fading away. 

The first 1-3 days I had severe anxiety and felt really depressed, this also faded a lot (but it’s still there). My sleep quality is better BUT I have a lot of nightmares and I sweat a lot. Sometimes I wake up feeling really exhausted. 

After all I still feel depressed, but i have it under control now. Meditation does help a lot. Sometimes I get urges and get really irritated. I have this voice in my head that tries to get me smoking again but I’m aware of it.. its just the addiction. I have to stay strong now.

This is my experience, don’t give up guys. I’m 100% sure it gets better. I had a few moments where i felt incredibly great and i guess thats just a teaser for the future.

I would pretty much smoke before i did anything and everything. I’ve tried to quit in the past, but always came back no matter what. Weed has fucked up my natural reward system i think. There would be times where I’d rather light up than eat. Not to mention all the anxiety and paranoia it has caused me. But 3 days ago I finally had enough and said fuck it, I’m done. 

I really though that I would be craving it more, but honestly that’s not the case (although it is only day 3 so that could come later). I really just want to be clear headed and be able to appreciate life sober instead of spending every waking hour in a haze. I want to be able to have a good time with out having to be fucked up.

The hardest part right now is the withdrawals. I’m feeling fatigued, nauseous, hungry but no desire to eat, headache, and been making lots of trips to the bathroom. It honestly really sucks, and the temptation to smoke is definitely there to alleviate the symptoms, but I know it’s not worth it. Thankfully I haven’t had any insomnia, which is weird because that has been the worst symptom I’ve had all the prior times I’ve tried to quit. But I’m just going to keep on pushing through no matter how bad it gets.

Getting high in the backseat of the car while jamming out to “Last Dance with Mary Jane” and eating Wendy’s. Just the boys, you, and me. Food never tasted so good. Movies were never so immersive. Jokes were never so funny. I started to philosophize yet had no idea what philosophy actually was.

Those days were so much fun and full of excitement. You made me see the world so fresh and showed me there was a different side of life than the one devoted to god, school, work, and my repressive family. It was my first real act of rebellion. My first real taste of freedom. You relieved my social anxiety and made me feel like I had friends. Like I belonged somewhere.

It wasn’t all fun and games though. Remember that time I took you in so deeply that you made me throw up in Adam’s toilet? Or all those times that mom and dad found you in my bedroom drawer, threw you away, and punished me? The burning throat and the fire inside my lungs? But, they didn’t matter all that much. You showed me that you were the key to making friends.

I found you straight away when I moved to college. This was the true start of our relationship. Very quickly I realized that I could use you to make new friends. Not only that, I could make money off of you. It was a win-win, or so I thought. We spent so many nights in the park gazing at the city lights around friends—some of which genuinely cared about me and some of which only cared about you. I never even noticed the difference back then. I sold you so many times, but I could always buy more of you. You were always different. You had your good days and your bad days, but you always lifted me up and put money in my pockets. I couldn’t get enough of you. I used you before class, before meals, before work, before going out, before bed, after I woke up, to nurse my hangovers. I used you just to use you. Even the act of preparing you was enough to trigger soothing.

I tried to look past all the shady situations you put me in. The Jamaican bus driver who ripped me off too many times. The Colombian gangster who sold you laced with formaldehyde. I was robbed three times of you. Once by a group of masked men, once by “friends” who snuck into my place while I did laundry downstairs, and once by a duo who tricked me, grabbed you, and ran faster than I could catch you. It took me a while to learn that everyone was taking advantage of me. I wasn’t cut out for selling you. I eventually stopped and hoarded you to myself and shared you only with my closest friends.

When college ended, we moved away for grad school. Time to buckle down. But, I couldn’t leave you behind. It was just you and me now, baby, for years on end. The Golden-Haired Years. You were always there for me when no one else would. You soothed me like no one else could. The unbearable isolation was made bearable. I could shut the world out just knowing you were with me. Days went by when we wouldn’t leave the house. We got a dog and would walk around for hours, just the three of us. Eventually, I got married, and while you didn’t come to the wedding, you were there on our wedding night. We got a real job in another state, and I took so much of you with me fearing that I might not find you there. But, of course, I eventually did. You helped me relax every day after work. 

But, I started to resent you. You wouldn’t leave me alone. You became possessive and would call on me whenever I was doing something too long without you. I couldn’t leave the house without first consulting you. You hurt me and damaged my lungs. I would gasp for air and use an inhaler when I never had asthma. You made me so scared. You stole my dreams and left me to sleep in a dull void of nothingness. You gave me anxiety. You took away my memories. You made me question every social interaction in the day. You tormented me with doubt. You drained me of so much money. You sucked the joy out of trips to see family when I couldn’t take you with me. I risked my life so many times to get you. To take you with me to forbidden places. My life revolved around you. My wallet emptied. But, you were not the same as I remembered you in those early days. It was only the first hit of the day where I felt close to you. After that, it was just routine. But that didn’t mean I would stop. I couldn’t quit you. You just couldn’t take me to the places that we used to go. That was okay; I still caressed you every night while my real partner sat across the couch. It was always you and me. You still gave me comfort.

We moved again across the country for a new job. I could now buy you so easily. Last summer was so much fun exploring the city. But, no longer could I enjoy you like I had for so many years before. I saw the real you. I saw just how ugly you made me. How dependent I was on you for everything. How desperate I was. I was so sick of the pain, the forgetting, the fogginess, the inability to enjoy anything without you. The inability to simply be without you. Not only did I resent you, I resented me. Who was abusing who?

I got help. And one day, just left you behind. I had other things to do that day. I never even said goodbye. You cruel thing, you made me sick for 10 straight days. The nausea was relentless. The pain in my testicles felt like being kicked there over and over again. I could barely eat. When I finally found sleep, I would wake up in a pool of my own cold sweat. But eventually you let me go. You let me move on.

100 days later, and I still think about you. I even still miss you at times. But mostly, I’ve forgotten about you. I think more clearly, dream more vividly, live more intentionally, and most of all, can enjoy things without you. Sadly, it’s not all a happy ending. The reason for why I was so drawn to you in the first place continues to haunt me. The pit inside me is still as deep as ever. Without you, I have to find soothing for my emotions in other ways. Fourteen years of dependency and my entire adult life spent in your wretched grip; now I have to learn to live on my own. Life without you is just so damn hard. I know I will mourn you, at least for a while longer. But, I know I am better this way.

I carry the health insurance so I can’t quit and I hold a degree so I need to make at least the same to keep paying loans. 

I have bad anxiety and depression. I’m not on anything prescribed and know I’ll feel happier once I get through the first week. It just all feels so hopeless. Especially when it’s “just one more day. “

I NEED to stop though. I’m kicking myself for not stopping 6-8 months ago and keep thinking of what a better place I would be in, even just careerwise. 

It’s difficult because my SO also has a problem and doesn’t need to quit. He works for himself doing real estate and stocks. It’ll be 30 feet away whenever I’m home.

Day 3 today (again). Last night was rough. Cried more than i have in months. Some things happening with work politics and withdrawal insomnia just lead me face to face with how I feel in my life. And that's not great. 

I'm scared. I'm frustrated. I feel like I dont have any clue about life. About anything. I dont know what I am. I dont know who I am. I dont know where I come from or what I'm supposed to be doing. And I dont know how to figure any of that out. And everything anyone has tried to tell me about it just hasn't worked. And I dont even trust that they know what they're talking about. How can I trust anyone? I would have to decide to trust them and I know I dont know shit about judging anything accurately in life. Everything in my life is accidental, I dont know how it happened. And it hurts so much because I ve got the natural equivalent of a super weapon/computer (a human life and brain) and I dont know how to handle it. I keep hurting myself. I keep hurting everyone around me. And nobody can explain how to stop. 

I just want to be able to see clearly. I want to be free of this pain and confusion. But I dont know how to open my eyes.

Today was that day. I’ve quit before in the past- I went several weeks without at the end of Summer only to break it to celebrate my cousins birthday. That was a mistake because I was finally feeling clear headed. I smoked everyday since then, typically smoking just one blunt an evening. My reasons for quitting are because I feel unmotivated and I’m tired of centering my days around my “smoke time.” I would overeat, wake up groggy, my memory has become HORRIBLE, and I would also get sick in the morning (likely because the food + smoking + acid reflux.) 

This is going to be extremely hard for me. I live down the street from a few dispensaries, my job pays really good so money hasn’t been a problem during this smoking binge, and my roommates (brother and cousin) smoke multiple times a day.

I bought some dinner, but I was able to only eat half of it. I’m looking forward to being able to eat meals without having to smoke. I’m looking forward to waking up in the morning and not feeling groggy. I’m looking forward to dreaming again! I never dream (or remember them, at least).

I never really understood why I smoked so often. I think it just became a habit at some point. I was depressed around the time I start smoking. That was when I was 15, and I’m 25 now. I struggled with anxiety in school, and I still struggle with it today. I guess weed helped me escape that. It quieted things for me and “helped” me worry less. I would smoke and I think it signaled to my body and mind that it was time to relax. But that’s just a superficial reality created by weed.

I don’t really know why I’m writing this post. I think I just needed a place to kind of summarize my relationship with cannabis. It’s going to be hard to enjoy my usual high activities sober, but I know I will get there. Of course I would appreciate any tips or anything that might make this a little easier.

The insomnia is the thing I hate most about quitting and it’s the main reason I haven’t done it sooner. There’s never a “good day” to quit. Tomorrow I’ll be shot, and have no motivation to get anything done. I’ll want to smoke just to get some relief from the constant throbbing feeling in my head. 

This is probably the longest I’ve gone in 7 years without smoking. I don’t remember the last time I skipped a day. 

My weed brain can’t imagine a world without weed. I was about to break and realized I can’t even take a break for a day. Even my biggest stoner friends took tolerance breaks now and then. And I can’t get to the end of the week. 

Needs to change. Can’t keep letting this thing have power over my life. It occurred to me that being addicted to anything is fucked up. Like I started comparing myself to those people on reality shows that are addicted to pizza, or just drink soda. Like that seems fucking crazy to me, but some how burning a plant in a water pipe and inhaling from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep every fucking day is somehow fine?! Need to stop normalizing it. 

I saw a post a while ago that was talking about the propaganda with weed. The legalization marketing got me hook line and sinker even tho I smoked before. I bought in 100% to the “non addictive qualities” and always defended it as the lesser of every evil if you’re an addict. Now I’m realizing, I’ve been lying to myself the whole time, and that weed is a very sinister drug in that creeps in slowing without you realizing it, and before you know it, you can’t start the day without it. And it’s actually FUCKED UP when you try to explain the withdrawal, and the fucking response every time (mostly non smokers) is “there aren’t any withdrawals.” So you’re being gas lighted into thinking you’re withdraw experience isn’t real. 

And so I need to thank you all for posting and validating the experience. I think just knowing others are dealing with the same things, makes me able to deal with the problem, and acknowledge it is a problem. 

I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. I had to go to a few AA meetings because I got a Dui a five years ago. (I gave up alcohol and thought weed was the safe alternative. Wrong.) They said you’re ready to join when your sick and tired of being sick and tired. I really understand what that means now. The endless cycles of trying to break it, giving up. Spiraling down, hitting the bottom, getting a moment of clarity, try to break it, giving in. Spiraling down, hitting the bottom, getting a moment of clarity. Trying to breaking it...you get it.

So having said that, maybe I’ll stick to this. I don’t have a plan. Was first just thinking take a day off. And maybe a few more, and then maybe a week. And maybe a month. And then maybe a year would go by and I didn’t smoke any weed. I like the sound of that.

I really want to quite smoking weed. I've quit for long periods of time before, and really didn't think I'd end up back smoking as much as I am now again.

I'd stopped smoking for about 7 months after being a longtime user, and it was easy because I was traveling in a different country, exploring new places everyday, working new jobs, and I didn't even miss it. I was feeling more alive and energized than I'd felt in years. I then returned to my seasonal summer job, and slowly started smoking again, thinking it could just be casual. At first it really was, for the first 3ish months. Then I started smoking everyday again, but not for too long until I was off travelling again. The problem this time, is the farm I was working and the share house I was living in had some weed smokers, and very easy access to weed. I was smoking daily again within a few weeks, and shortly after that I was smoking before work.

I then quite again though, when I jetted off from there to do my yoga teacher training. I was in a country where weed possession is punishable by death, and I'm not that kind of risk taker. I had such a lovely community there, and was so busy absorbing all the beauty around me, I once again didn't miss weed at all. During this time I really thought a lot about how I never wanted to go back to smoking everyday, and was really committed to sticking to it. I went another 6 months or so smoke free. Even when arriving back home and hanging out with friends I used to smoke with I had no desire. I was feeling so good, and felt like this sobriety thing was so doable, and sustainable.

Then covid hit and we went into full lockdown. I was back at my moms house (where I hadn't lived since 18), living in her basement. We're quite different and have always had a very strained relationship, especially since my dad passed away. I was bored and isolated and lonely, and feeling depression and anxiety that I'd thought I'd learned to manage and overcome. So I started smoking. My other coping mechanisms were gone, and I turned to weed even though I knew it would ultimately make me feel worse rather than better.

Anyways, that was a year ago, and now I'm smoking more than ever. Though I'm no longer in my moms basement, and in a much better place in other ways. I stopped for 3 days in December, but caved under the withdrawal symptoms and Christmas misery. I've had multiple ""first days"" since then, but haven't made it far past that.

I know I can quit, I really think I can, I'm just struggling to start right now. I've had to quit at other points over the years, for various reasons, and succeeded. I just really don't have access to my normal strategies at the moment. Normally when I'm trying to quit, I fill my schedule and make sure I'm never home. I go to a yoga class before work, to make it harder to smoke in the morning, I'll go to the gym or a spin class after work, then meet up with a friend (who doesn't smoke) for dinner etc. I stay busy, I work out a lot and stay with people. The problem is, I don't have work right now, gyms and the like are closed, and I can't see my friends still because of Covid. I find myself with great plans to quit, but end up giving in as the boredom and apathy set in. I question what the point even is to quitting.

I start work for my seasonal summer job in about 4 weeks, and I want to be quit and past the worst of withdrawals before I start. I figure maybe it's time to seek some sort of community and support with this, instead of trying to do it all on my own. Even if for now, that support is just a reddit community. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for what has helped to keep them from smoking, specifically during covid times and with various lockdowns? Especially in those first few days and first week.

At the beginning of my sobriety this subreddit was an absolute lifesaver. My advice to anyone trying to quit is to subscribe and contribute positive energy to as many posts as you wish to. That being said I thought I’d add in some of my thoughts about staying off weed for around a year from smoking heavily for 4ish years.

The cravings go away. For me one of the main reasons I would put off quitting was the things I’d read about people craving the drug for months even years afterwards. I don’t want to say this is false, but the reality for me was after a week of forcing myself and telling myself no, the cravings went away. One weird point though is I do still love the smell of someone smoking and it always draws my attention. There’s no urge to smoke though.

My life hasn’t considerably improved and I’m still fairly lazy. I still play too many video games and watch too much Netflix, but it’s nice to not be constantly dazed and wake up groggy. Quitting has 100% been worth it, but I expected the rest of my lifestyle to follow suit magically and it has not. Don’t kid yourself into thinking yours will too.

There’s many positives to quitting - family life improvements, mental retention, more energy, a bigger bank account! But there are supposed negatives too. Lost friends and learning to cope with boredom were the two biggest for me. But be under no illusion I and the people around me consider myself a far better person post-addiction.

And that’s about it. Just some of my thoughts about quitting. I want to offer the best of luck to everyone here and remember, relapses are normal.

It feels different this time, and BOY has my life taken a 180 degree turn in the last 14 days. It hasn't been perfect, but I am feeling a lot better than the first few days and hoping that will improve over the weeks and months to come. Here are some of the things that have changed for me.

\- Binge eating when high, haven't overeaten like that in 14 days and I feel great. I must have lost 10 lbs so far. 

\- Eating much better which I hope/think will help lower my blood pressure back to a normal level. Definitely elevated from nicotine/marijuana abuse over the years, as well as bad eating when high. 

\- Saved a bunch of money from not binge eating, late night munchie runs, and ordering pizza as a second dinner after what used to be a nightly bowl. 

\- Checking the Health app on my Iphone, my weekly steps are up by almost an average of 2000. I found myself with a lot of free time and I've been spending it by moving a lot more. Long walks and just enjoying the beginning of spring outside in general. 

\- Iphone screen time is down 2 hours on average from when I was smoking. Definitely spending more time being present and feeling it too. 

\- Been hitting the gym hard, something I wanted to get back into but always found myself racing home from work to get high instead of putting in time at the gym. 

\- Able to go to bed a lot earlier, sleep still isn't great but it is much better than week one. 

\- Dreams are back, not sure if I love this or not but they are long and vivid and it is kind of cool. I never dream when I'm high. 

\- Not afraid to take calls from my GF or my parents, I used to not want to answer the phone when I was high because I didn't want anyone to know. 

\- No more waking up with a foggy head and not wanting to answer calls from my clients. 

\- Able to watch TV and movies and actually pay attention instead of look at my phone the whole time. 

\- Able to read and remember what I'm reading, so that I actually understand what I am reading. 

\- Creating clear, tangible paths to my goals that are ACTUALLY WORKING. No more flip flopping between goals, just daily progress. This feels great.

Every time I failed to moderate my usage every where I looked it was just people saying that you couldn't have a problem with weed; it wasn't possible because it isn't physically addictive. This community let me accept I had a problem.

There was a lot of signs for me that led me to believe I had a problem, and I'll share some in case it rings true with someone else. 

My first sign was the money, since I've started tracking my budget in January of 2020 I've spent almost 4 grand on weed, which is insane. I could have traded in my daily for a vette with that money!

My energy levels: I was just tired all the time. I'm much more fun, animated person to be around sober. I'd get more lost in the music when I went to raves/shows sober and my energy levels were so much better. People have mentioned me being on something at shows several times when I'm sober, never when I'm high. 

I noticed I can't meditate while high. When I added meditation into my life it really improved my headspace and gave me a way to clear my thoughts, something I thought weed was doing, but when I smoked I couldn't meditate for the life of me. I'd get nauseated trying. 

Last but not least my productivity. Even when I was moderating I couldn't be productive because all I was thinking about was when my KSafe was going to open up and I could smoke again! For the longest time I could get everything I needed to do, my job was pretty easy to me, while I was high. Recently I got a new job, am contracting at my old job still, and am writing my own SaaS product as well. I just couldn't balance all of that while getting high anymore and for the first time in my life was worried it could effect my employment. Something I read here about weed being a luxury for the rich who had already accomplished what they wanted to accomplish in their life rang true. Most of the time I was high I just wanted to be sober working on a project or a hobby anyways.

Once I graduated, I still kept on smoking, but I felt bad because I knew I wanted to quit. Every time I wanted to quit and finished a cart, I’d start having anxiety and start thinking “Oh man, but without weed I’m going to get anxiety” and somehow end up in front of the house, paying the delivery man for my cart.

You only live once and what you do is who you are. I used to think it was cool how functional I was when I was stoned, “Wow I’m so smart when I’m fried, I must be a god when I’m sober.” But when I’m sober the thoughts race too fast and I’m overwhelmed by my emotions.  

Those lies are all a farce.  Why live life at 60% just to prove you can do it? Do you want to fulfill 60% of your potential? I’m sure we’ve all been told, “you’re so gifted, but you need to apply yourself.”  And I resent the phrase.

- Better consistency about reaching goals

- MOOD AND ENERGY CONSISTENCY (THIS IS HUGE)

- Freedom from a self imposed shame 
 
- Being able to apply to any job without fear

I couldn’t go on smoking while trying to be the best version of myself, so I quit cold turkey. I’ve been sober before, I always forget how good I feel sober because the pit of addiction blinds me. The first three days have been hard. I’ve forced myself to exercise and transfer my emotional pain to physical pain. I’m a big Eminem fan, and his recovery album has really helped me push through whenever I feel hopeless or cravings. He has 13 years sober and is such an inspiration.

I also think of a recovering meth addict I met in an outpatient program once, who had struggled for years with addiction and was beating it one day at a time, exercising from dusk to dawn. My predicament is nothing compared to him, so I must be capable of beating my addiction. 

I’m taking each day at a time, but this time, I know I can’t smoke. I’ve already worked so hard to get through these past four days. Forget going through that shit again.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6145837}"
2021-03-15 10:08:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/m5lhax/lessons_learned_but_stressed_disappointed/,Lessons learned: But... Stressed & Disappointed,"After years of using weed I quit cold turkey in August of 2020, but in mid February of 2021, I not only relapsed, I went on a full fledged bender, one which saw me ignoring work assignments, becoming totally disorganized and disinterested in the things that are important to me.  I used in the morning, sometimes as early as 6:30 a.m.; I would sometimes use midday, because I could feel my anxiety creeping up on me and I would literally use from the moment I came home from work until I went to sleep.  I think that is a good description of out of control.

As background, I started out as an adult just having a few hits of a joint here and there to calm my anxiety.  Over a 15 year period things built up, and about a year ago, at the start of the Pandemic I tried vaping weed for the first time.  It was amazing, it was strong and I was immediately hooked on the feeling of being totally ""baked"".  I liked it a lot!!  Like everyone on this forum, my  way to escape became a nightmare, and by the middle of last summer I knew that weed was fundamentally changing who I was - Ill get to that in a little bit.

So a few things; **1)** I knew when I ordered the vape cartridges and was going to the store to pick them up  (twice I went - 1 time in Feb. & another time in March) that I was being self destructive, I told my self on both trips that I should turn around; **2)** I felt disappointed because somehow I was hiding the relapse from my wife, she knew of my struggles and is supportive, I am a liar; **3)** my work suffered significantly; **4)**  I was unmotivated; **5) most importantly, I made personal choices which are not congruent with my value system or who I am.  I feel completely disgusted with myself!!**

So today I am one day sober, well LOL a day and a half.  I feel angry with myself and disappointed with myself., but I am here writing, my head is still foggy but clearing and I am thinking about why I relapsed.  What did I do wrong?

In looking at my strategy a few things stand out for me:  1) I stopped coming to this sub and just writing a few days per week, reminding myself of my journey and commitment - who cares if anyone even reads the post, thats not the point; 2) this is probably the most important, I basically ""white knuckled"" my way through the six months.  I did not examine nor seek to understand how patterns and behaviors trigger anxiety which in turn forms the basis (at least for me) whereby I seek relief.

So moving forward I must be more cognizant of the interplay between ""bad"" coping habits and how they in turn trigger my desire to escape.  I guess more to the point, I have read in many, many places that you have to take up hobbies, make new friends etc.  I understand better that change is not change for changes sake, but rather to break patterns and behaviors which serve as triggers.  Noting and changing unproductive behaviors, developing new ways of approaching situations that cause anxiety and examining how behaviors and patterns developed in the first place is part of this segment of my journey.  I remain hopeful and feel great that the six weeks is behind me and I am back on my journey.  

One last thing; even though I went over six months, I can look back and see that my commitment was not 100%.  I still had vape batteries and magnets.  I know in the back of my mind that I kept them for a reason; I was not truly ready, not committed 100%. So on Saturday morning I put my four vape cartridges, the magnets and the batteries into a plastic bag and smashed them with a hammer and put them into the garbage.

I'm about 3 days into quitting, it's nearly midnight, I'm itchy, I can't sleep and I'm not thrilled about the next round of crazy dreams. I was one of those classic teen smokers that started to escape trauma. Gay guy with a crazy religious family was not the greatest. I've smoked pretty consistently up until now with a few teeny gaps in between.  I'm 29 now and after picking up and dropping various things throughout my 20s (career paths, relationships etc..) I'm finally feeling like I'm on track to do something good. Managed to get into a pretty well renowned design school doing a graduate diploma in graphics. 
It dawned on me (if I'm honest quite a long time ago) that weed was no longer serving me but holding me back. I'm definitely starting to feel a little clearer but I guess my biggest fear is that I've done some kind of irreparable damage to my potential as a person. I was a high achiever as a kid and now I'm nearly 30 and I've pretty much been overtaken by my peers across the board. Many a failed relationship, study that has gone nowhere and a number of dead end jobs.
I've come to realize that for me smoking weed was a pause button,  I'd become overwhelmed and hit pause. But now I know that I wasn't pausing but rather my video game character was just standing there shuffling his feet while the game continued around him. 
I guess I'm just posting here to ask if that potential and capability is still in there or if I've fried my brain with innumerable spliffs.
Any advice from anyone with experience would be massively appreciated :)

I’m 6 days into going without and while I’ve noticed some positive changes already, I am still struggling pretty badly with cravings, so I thought I’d reach out for some encouraging experiences.

For me, one of the most difficult parts about quitting is worrying about seeing the potential damage I’ve done to my mind. I basically smoked daily, usually all day, from the time I was 13 years old to now, which totals 13 years of being high - half of my lifetime. I smoked through such a critical phase of my development and that’s hard to deal with.

I am hoping to hear from people who also smoked so heavily and at such a critical time. I used to be very sharp, often the top of my class. It’s obvious to me that my mind has become dull; I have difficulty focusing and retaining information. I’m basically in a constant brain fog.

Side note: I do have CPTSD and suspected ADHD, which obviously have an impact on this, but the thing is I was nowhere close to this spacey when I was 13 and younger. I am nearly positive being high like I was affected my mental clarity.

*TL:DR;* Based on your experience: Do you think I have any chance of regaining my mental sharpness, or is this something I’ll have to live with forever?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6200164}"

Over time it shifted, both of my parents smoke weed and eventually they let my brother and I both start smoking in the house, ever since then I’ve been a daily smoker.

I used to do really well in school, wouldn’t consider myself outright social back then either but not as antisocial as I find myself either.

I used to have dreams, not just while sleeping but for a time I really didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. Gradually all my hobbies shifted to smoking, before I play anything? Gotta smoke a bowl, new video? Bowl, practically everything I did was just smoke and tell myself “one more bowl then I’ll play.” Ending up wasting hours.

My parents and brother still smoke, obviously I can’t and don’t plan on asking them to stop as that’d be unreasonable. The hard part comes from the insanely easy access from it just being.. all around the house. I’ve tried quitting a few times and every time I’ve always managed to find some somewhere in a moment of weakness.

It’s been about a year since the last attempt, but now I’ve come to the realization at just how much I want to quit, and need to if I want to have a fulfilling life.  I’ve told myself this quarter would be the last, and now it’s coming close to it’s end. Tomorrow will be Day One. I’m scared of the withdrawal and how my mood will be, terrified of snapping at everyone around me as for the past 6 years I’ve been used to being high during almost every waking moment.

This is my Day 1.,"I've been smoking this stuff for 11 years. I'm 28 now, and every single goal i've set for myself, every ambition, I haven't achieved any of it (or at the very least, very little of them) because of smoking this stuff.

(Thats what I like to call it btw, the ""stuff"". I hate using words like pot, weed or cannabis. I always call it the ""stuff"")

11 years of smoking has taken a toll on my mind. My social anxiety has rocketed to such extreme heights, that I can no longer properly communicate online anymore. Hovering my mouse cursor over the 'submit' button, and it's like there is an invisible force controlling my hand that is stopping me. I quite literally have to use my other hand to press down on my finger to post something, all while looking away and shaking. This is so unbelievably hard for me, you have no idea. But I have to do this. So many years of not having friends both online and offline, I can't take it anymore. This post right here is my first step into kicking my addiction, and then rebuilding my social skills from the ground up. I've wasted so much time with cannabis it's unbelievable. My goal right now is to get my head clear, then start posting on r/socialskills and r/needafriend and go from there.

For now though, I have to tackle the weed and whats to come. Oh yeah, I've done this many times before so I know what's coming, and I just can't fucking wait /s. Depression, boredom, nausea, erratic emotions, lack of sleep... I got to keep focusing on the rewards once I get through it, instead of on the withdraw symptoms.

I managed to stop smoking it several years ago, and that sober period lasted for a good year and a half. But one day I was just going about my day in college, when my ears started burning once someone said ""Yea I can get you a gram, the guy I know always has good bud"", and that was it. I was having a particularly bad day, so I justified myself asking them if they could help me get some. I was then back on track for ruining my life. I passed my college course by the skin of my teeth because I was only attending 2 days a week of my 4 day a week course. Where was I? Oh you know. I was at home, on my disgusting gaming chair, sat in front of an even more disgusting keyboard and monitor, with a family-sized bag of doritos on one side of my desk, half an ounce of herb on the other, with Star Trek TNG playing on my monitor front and center.

That's right. I was more interested in being the very definition of a disgusting, lazy slob than studying for my future. Typing this is making me so fucking angry. I wish I could go back in time, kick my bedroom door down, rip myself from that horrible chair and smack some sense into myself. Oh well, it's all in the past now. I haven't slobbed it up that badly for a couple of months.

(You see the words ""disgusting lazy slob"" and it's probably natural that your mind attaches the word ""fat"" to them. Nope, no fat for me. Not because of good diet or exercise, but because of excessive cannabis smoking annihilated my appetite.)

So whats my motivation for this? I finally moved out of my parents house into my own place. It's something I wanted, and it's something I knew I was ready for. I've been living here for two weeks pissing off the neighbors with my constant smoking, but it's been great so far. But I feel wrong, like I don't belong here. The right person that belongs in such a beautiful house is someone that has a life. I don't have a life in any form right now, and I know for a fact that I will NEVER have a life so long as I smoke this stuff. I'm 28 and I still don't drive because of my anxiety and laziness brought about by cannabis. I know that if I want to drive my own car, I absolutely have to leave cannabis alone.

I love cannabis, I'll admit it. Taking a whiff of it when you first buy a bag, feeling the buds texture, feeling if it's too spongy or nice and firm. The way the bud crumbles into a glittering pile of green goodness. I love rolling, too. It might be my favorite thing about smoking it, is the pride I take in my roll. I always do the same thing, too. One short paper, a layer of weed, a layer of rolling tobacco on top of that, topped with another layer of weed. Makes a nice central core of combusting tobacco that ensures no side-burnage. Just typing this is making my mouth water, wishing I could go buy another bag. Don't worry though, I know I've had my last toke (last night actually)

There's no half-way point for me. It's either smoke it all the time, all day every day, or don't smoke it at all. I just can't control myself. I describe myself as being like a dog with a giant opened bag of treats infront of me, then being told ""I'm going out for an hour. Don't touch those treats"".

I know deep down that I have to stop this permanently. I know I can do it (hell, I have no choice since I cut off contact with my dealers. It's what I did last time and it worked! I was clean for a good year and a half!). I just.. want more for my life. I don't want to live like this anymore. You know I'm 28 and I've never had a relationship with a girl? I know I could if I really wanted it,(I know I'm not ugly, which is strange considering I have such low self-esteem that it's pretty much transformed into self-hatred) but I've never made the effort because of cannabis. When I'm high, I didn't care about being a lonely little loser. I didn't care that I had no friends, no job, no car, no nothing. All I cared about was what funny video to watch on youtube next, or what singleplayer game to play next (stopped playing multiplayer because my social anxiety became so bad that I couldn't aim or use the keyboard properly because I was shaking too badly), or where and when my next bag of bud will be coming.

One of the worst things about stopping smoking for me is that I'm realizing that I don't have things that everyone else takes for granted such as friends or a sex life. I'm 28, I'm fucking old now, and I hope it's not too late. I hope that my mind isn't so damaged that I'll never be able to become the kind of person I want to be. And I pray that I don't have lung cancer. (My brother had it and died from it. Such a thing would permanently ward a person away from ever touching a cigarette. It never happened with me.)

Hopefully this is the last paragraph. Every time I complete a paragraph, I think of another thing to say. I'm really sorry for writing all of this text, but years of having no friends, no outlets, and no one to talk to, this is the result. I've got too much to say, and it's all coming out at once. You have my permission to skip over parts of what I wrote, I wrote too much. Just so long as someone out there reads some of what I have to say, it would mean so incredibly much.

I just need some support and to communicate with someone who has been in my shoes like you all.

&#x200B;

To sum it up I have been smoking for about 2 years. After consistent use, it eventually led to binges and then withdrawals once I ran out. That's sad, right? I never stopped a binge unless I ran out.

&#x200B;

Every time I sober up I tell myself I will never touch weed again just to relapse in the future. There are no excuses & I am not making any but I know where my dependence stems from. I suffer from a specific mental illness/disorder (Many claims that weed helps this problem)

&#x200B;

When I start getting high I become a lazy slob who is selfish. This dependence is a huge part of the reason why my last relationship ended, My family does not trust me, and my criminal record is no longer clean.

&#x200B;

Despite all this, I still struggle to quit for good. I feel like a dumbass cause I thought I could start over and use it in moderation but I was just lying to myself. I am sober right now but sadly there is still part of me that wants to relapse.

&#x200B;

Not because I currently crave it, I just do not feel like going through another withdrawal again. Usually, my disorder is horrible during the 1st week of quitting. For ex. I never hallucinate, although during withdrawal I have seen and heard things. I know it's better to just quit but I need some motivation and support right now. I have decided to start taking meds once this wd is over.

So here’s a bit of history first; Im 23 now and I started smoking weed when I was 19 and in college. All of the friends that I made also smoked and I was pretty lonely back then so it was kind of a social thing to smoke but it ended up becoming more than that. My friends all smoked for quite some time and had pretty high tolerance so when I started I smoked a lot with them and everyday when I would go home I would be so baked that I went to bed immediately. Around the time I started I began to put less effort into my exams and it caused me to fall behind, this continued up until the 4th year, which i am in right now. I didn’t really smoke unless I was with others back then and if i did it would be a pre-rolled joint and it would be max 1 in a day. 

I started smoking more around October 2019 because one of my co-workers from the restaurant I worked in broke up and I felt bad for him and thought he could use a friend during this tough time. This ended up becoming quite a codependent friendship where we would hang out almost every night and smoke weed until 3-5 am. I have a girlfriend who I met during September 2019, in the beginning I was pretty scared of commitment and weed became an escape to all my relationship, work and school stress. I used it to run away from all my problems. 

I have tried several times to quit smoking but most efforts lasted around 1 week to 1 month. During this time I could sense that I felt very different and I was very glad that I stopped but when I start smoking again I was tell myself that things would not be that much different if I were to quit. Im tired of running from my problems and I want to be a strong man that people can depend on. Currently I cannot force myself to do any of the things I have to do until I have 1 day left and then I start to panic and I do it. I’m at the point where if I don’t quit now its going to have a huge negative impact on my life and I’m terrified of that happening because I could lose everything I have.

and then my subconscious rewarded this line of thought with: you are stronger than you think you are. and i burst into tears because i felt the power of clarity and control in a way that i knew i wanted but could never achieve when i was struggling with addiction. today I still feel weird, but i feel proud to know i beat such a horrific internal battle that i know i will have to face again. maybe next Saturday! but i will never forget how strong and capable i am to be calm, at peace, and in control of who i am in every moment.

i hope my story serves this community in a positive way because i could not have gotten through yesterday without the collective power of everyone who is going through the bends of addiction/sobriety. love to all of you xoxo",46,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.47492787}"

I am just over 3 months sober after struggling with quitting for years. I am finally taking action on things I talked about doing for a long time (hello, first triathlon!) and have learned a lot about myself and how I am much better off without weed. Not the easiest, but definitely the best decision I've made in a long time. Reading the stories and support on here has helped me to do it for real this time and kept me from giving in when times get rough. It definitely is not always easy..but its worth it!

Anyway- it's time to give back a little. I have a book on the subject that I would like to send to someone who needs/wants it.

I'll post when it's been spoken for.

Anyway, thank you to everyone who contributes to this sub. I was genuinely just perusing because I knew I was smoking an unhealthy amount and wanted to figure out how to dial it back but after reading through so many posts it really hit me just how bad things had gotten and how much better my life could be if I could just quit altogether. I very frequently think of a quote from one of u/subduction's top posts and it deeply motivated me to keep going, especially during the awful period of withdrawals. **""I am also living proof that life has unimaginable rewards waiting for you if you do""** 

Here is a list of all the things I have accomplished in the past month or so since I quit smoking: I applied to go back to school and mapped out a potential 5-year plan, I went from being unemployed to having TWO new jobs that I really like, I started waking up early every day and have an amazing morning ritual that I stick to consistently, I created a plan and started working on fixing my credit score and financials, I stopped picking at my head... this one is pretty embarrassing but is a huge deal for me, I finally FINALLY sleep through the night. My anxiety has been reduced so greatly that I'm wondering if I even had it at all or if it was just weed-induced. The biggest accomplishment is that I now have a very clear picture of my unhealthy relationship with alcohol and am currently working towards a life of total sobriety. It's really hard but I know it is what's best for me and am being as kind and patient with myself as I possibly can.

I see a lot of people on this sub who have trouble with keeping to their goal and relapsing. I just want you to know that it's ok to fail and that the most important part is not giving up when you do. This is gross but after I gave all my flower away I smoked resin bowls for weeks until I didn't have a shred of dignity in sight. Hindsight being 20/20 I know I should have also cleaned my glass out too but you live and you learn. My number one piece of advice for anyone having trouble quitting is to physically write down a list of what you hope to accomplish and look at it every single day as a reminder of the person you can be without weed. Adopting a positive goal mindset makes things way easier than focusing on ""taking something away"" or getting down on yourself. 

Thanks again everyone, virtual hugs to each and every one of you.

It can rob you of your motivation, your personality, your health, your money and your ambition. But for some reason it gets such a good press and people seem to talk about it like it's small fry.

My social life is pretty much non existent now because all I do is get home from work, smoke, then watch hockey until I fall asleep.

Also, not sure if I should post it here or on r/DecidingToBeBetter, but it might be useful in a way. Secondly, my style might look pretentious because I have no great command over language. I need to say that I am supportive to anyone quitting, that I understand that everyone is on their own journey. This is just my portion, my view.

I'm 22. I was probably never an avid smoker by the standards of community, I always smoked socially, sometimes every day, sometimes every three days, but in the previous year and a half there was only one pause that lasted longer than two weeks. It fucked up my life in many ways - I got lazy, I was often thinking about smoking and I would rather hang out with my smoking buddies (they eventually became friends) than with my other friends with whom I shared deeper and more profound connection. I also lost longing for adventure which was one of my main characteristics prior to smoking.

A few days ago I decided to stop with weed, alcohol and porn/masturbation, yet I decided to view weed as ""least of three evil"" for it looked much more benign than drinking bad and cheap liquor and beer and jerking off. Yesterday my friend came back after a month in another city and she had some good weed on her, and I decided: ""Well, I had quite productive day, I could smoke"". There were four of us, two of us wanted to smoke, and two of them wanted to drink beer. The day was beautiful and sunny. We went to the fortress (which is park at the same time). I had no urge to smoke yet, I wanted to explore a bit, yet like everyone was in a hurry to get to the most comfortable place and enjoy their substance. We lit the joint, and I felt good for a while, looking at the grass, at the sun, but then I started **speaking nonsense.** When I am sober, I am also a witty and humorous person, but when I smoke I start talking things which are funny only to me and to those who are stoned, for they have absolutely no coherence. During that period, I found out I have to pay much attention not to think negatively, to be responsible and so on. We decided to go to a friend's house when it got dark, and I wanted to go on foot (it's maybe a 35, 40 minute walk and it was a nice evening) yet we've just spent more time using public transit, then when we got there nobody wanted to do anything, a film we've watched many times was on, people talked about some very shitty stuff (like what kind of women they like, should they drink more etc.) and for the first time **it wasn't ok.** 

I understood that, if I was sober, I would have enjoyed it up to one moment and then I would go home to do something productive. Maybe I would have met with someone else whom I didn't see in a long time. Maybe I would have had a solitary walk by the river and meditated. Maybe, if I subconsciously knew there would be no weed, I would structure the whole hanging-out better. Yet, even stoned, I was more honest, I decided not to take anyone's shit. I went quite earlier than usually, but I've felt like I skipped a better part of the day.

Sobriety is just better. Weed, alcohol, drugs in general may enchant your life, give you illusion that something is happening, but you will need to pay, earlier or later. When sober, it will be easier to follow your principles, to decide what you truly want and what you don't, to speak more clearly, to think more clearly, to be more productive and to understand the world better, not through a hazy stoner worldview. On weed some aspects of life look better to me, but it's an illusion, Nothingness, it's purely chemical, it's a lie which I will forget when I wake up. But anxiety, paranoia and laziness and many other negative aspects are definitely real. It's always better to be sober. You can do anything. You can be your true self and return to your childlike enjoyment in game, become a homo ludens.

I smoked everyday for 6 years but depending on my work routine I would smoke between 1-3 grams a day usually. Since lockdown happened there was a steady increase in my usage maybe at worse smoking 4-5g a day as I was doing it from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed and also over time the amount I put into a joint to feel any affect got quite bad. I just decided to give up suddenly and I must say the first 3 days were the worst with the constant cold sweats, my digestive system bubbling away and not letting me eat or have bowel movements. The extremely broken sleep where I'd lie for a couple hours, sleep for an hour and a half then wake for a couple hours and so on all through the night. One of the worse symptoms was the anxiety attacks as I've never had them and these were extremely not nice but I managed to subside them with peppermint tea. My point of this post is I now feel pretty good tbh I'm feeling a lot more awake, energetic, my appetite is back and I can get a full 6 hours sleep pretty much with the odd wake up for maybe 2 mins as I'm still easily woken but can get back to sleep.

Today marks day 6 in my journey for a better life. This time feels different, I have tried the process many times to detox and recalibrate my brain but here's why this time is different. 

 Firstly - I didn't have the ability and knowledge I have gained from counselling, I have learned to find a new balance in my life leading up to this attempt by practicing mindfulness and being aware on the unrealistic expectations I put on myself, Im kinder to myself and remind myself I'm human and I can only do my best. I'm not perfect and never will be but I can get comfort from the fact that I have never been here in this moment before, today doesn't have to be the same. When I compare myself to other people I'm trying to be someone I'm not, if I look back on yesterday and compare me to myself then what I'm actually doing is accepting who I am as a person and that I can grow based on who I really am, not the front of what people want you to see on social media or just in real life.

Secondly- I have the knowledge of all my past experiences to learn from and withdraw safely and be proud of who I am now even if its just getting out of bed in the morning. Not every day is a good day but how I perceive my experience has had a huge turn around on those days. For example I can choose to listening to my body or mind when something isn't right and be accepting of the negative emotions even if its over nothing just letting the emotions be and not fighting or covering them has made them go away just like that on numerous occasions.

Thirdly- I have all of you incredible souls to support me and understand me in a way no one in my immediate family can which is so important knowing your not alone in this world. I have read more then posted but I am internally great full to every person who has courage to try to better them self's even if it's by acknowledgement of the fact that they have a problem. Cognitive dissonance is a real thing and everyone here can take pride in knowing they can/have move past it in this insanely insidious substance. But most of all thank you, thank you for being you and joining such an amazing community to grow and learn from others because I know for a fact it has made a huge impact on me.

It's early days for me but with the help from everyone on this sub and maintaining my use of knowledge I feel very comfortable saying for the first time ever, my use of weed is over. I'm excited to grow with you all and get to know the real me. Its a beautiful thing life and no matter what age you are i believe you can do it. Thank you for reading and I look forward to hearing your own stories and thoughts on your posts to come.

I had no idea what we were guarding it from, but I joined. there was a moment I asked myself, ""why am I doing this?"" and I realized it was stupid what I was doing, I was putting myself in danger. So, I walked to the other side of the road into a woman's driveway. The woman and her daughter are crouched hiding behind a car and a man in a truck drives up on the grass beside me. he hops out, and I see he has a gun. I run over to the woman and whisper ""he has a gun.."" 

dream over. I wake up. I had no idea what the hell my subconscious was just doing and I just assumed it was another meaningless dream. however, as the week went on, this dream stuck with me. the next week I saw my therapist and asked her what she thought of it. 

interestingly enough, I truly believe this dream had a meaning. she told me that maybe guarding that truck was resembling me smoking. I was putting myself in danger, (illegal state here) I had no idea why I was doing it, but other people were doing it! and until I left that truck, until I quit smoking, I wasn't able to actually help anyone else. once I did leave it behind, I was able to go help someone.

It was like I had found a better version of alcohol. Now? It's clear I've been using it to run away from my own problems. Years of childhood trauma, bottled up and ignored smoke sesh after smoke sesh. 

Today, that's all over. I said goodbye last night, smoked the last of what I had and went to bed. Today I woke up and so far, I'm feeling fine. Threw up earlier after a shower due to hunger, but that passed. Trying to just stay busy, but I do feel weirdly like im on autopilot. Just existing. Not good or bad. 

Talked to some friends about some ways to keep withdrawal at bay (specifically sleeplessness), so hopefully that will help. 

I've been trying to quit for ages but I'm the type that responds like an addict to weed, so it's taken two full years of wanting to quit to get here. What really pushed the start of this was not being able to buy from anyone. I didn't renew my med license, so I'm cut off. Those I knew that had some for purchase are also quitting now.

And honestly, i'm nervous. Im scared. Especially because of the trauma and emotions that are gonna resurface. But ive arrived at the end, a much needed last page to this chapter of cannabis use.

Started my quit journey about 15 days ago, I cut down to sprinkles in my tobacco which started me down the road of withdrawals, wanted to be able to enjoy moments without constantly thinking about getting home to light up.

6 days ago I went cold turkey, as I was worried with sprinkles I would accidentally get myself high and reset all my hard work. Originally intended to get myself off for 30 days, then enjoy it in moderation instead of every day, but after experiencing all the withdrawals, and knowing I'm an addict I binned my stash. Always struggled with anxiety (ptsd incident about 8 years ago), and now thinking the weed hasn't been the help I thought it was.

Hell it's been tough, constant anxiety through the roof that's put me on the edge, randomly start crying (with no real insight on why), moments of anger, short temper, nausea after eating (this combined with the anxiety is the worst, if I wasn't anxious before this kicks off the anxiety for the rest of the day), chills when I'm warm, waking up in the middle of the night with vivid dreams, leaving me in a very confused state, days of feeling stoned despite not touching any.

Whilst I'm busy (usually with work), there's moments of feeling euphoric, my heads clearer and I feel much more present, but then when I'm not busy it all comes crashing down with the anxiety kicking in. 

So far aside from working to stay busy, on my off days I haven't been able to figure out how to keep the anxiety and nausea at bay. Exercise helps, whilst I'm doing it and for about 20 minutes after, but then it all comes back again. Getting lost in TV shows or movies helps, but I soon binge through content.

Excuse the rant! Anyone got any tips, or suggestions for how you got through the rough times of anxiety?

I was trapped in my mind thinking that people could hear my thoughts (thought broadcasting) and id be communicating with them in my mind having conversations that simply just dont exist. This would also spiral out of control of me to think negative thoughts which would just keep twisting as the voices would be talking back to me. These voices are conversations of people who I am living with, some nice and some negative. I know this seems schizophrenic, although I am fully aware that this has never happened to me before. I am now 2 weeks sober, recovering by the day as this really scared me, and couldn't see myself smoking weed again. Thought broadcasting is still happening the odd time although i'm reminding myself its simply not there. I knew weed was gonna catch up on me one day but I never knew that anything like this was possible in happening but trust me, its really woken me up. I don't want to go back to a situation like that again. I felt as if I was causing bad energy even being around people when I was experiencing this, which made things even worse. What really is to explain for this? has anyone else had this problem before? I've done some research and i'm getting links to psychosis, schizophrenia and thought broadcasting.

I know it can seem daunting for those who are in the very early days (the first week was a huuuge struggle for me). But now that I’m on day 15, I can safely say it DOES get better, and easier. The first week is hell, always is and always will be. But that being said, the payoff for sticking out a week of negative feelings and emotions is huge!

- more motivation
-more energy
-less lethargic days where all you can do is sit on the couch in a stoned haze
-overall an increased sense of happiness
-dreams! Oh the dreams are wonderful!
-improved sleep quality
-waking up feeling more well rested
-a desire to just be healthier in general. Stoned me loved hot pockets but a good orange or banana, even a low-sugar yogurt, is wonderful

Mostly. What I mean by that is I still function as a member of society on a day to day. I do the bare minimum to keep my life in order but my main goal is to get by so I can get high and feel better about my day.

I started smoking when I started college and I kept it up all the way through. At first it was only in the evenings after I was done for the day. Slowly that started shifting to pretty much at any point I was at home. Then it was first thing in the morning, and in between classes.  

My habits changed. I used to be a very outgoing person. I liked going out and drinking with friends, rarely over did it. Weed changed that completely though. I kicked drinking and started being way more introverted. It manifested in the typical ""going out is so trite"" type of mentality. Like I was doing something morally superior by smoking myself stupid and passing out in front of the couch.

When I graduated things kind of went off the rails for me. I had plans to attend law school but I was unable to go down that path because of my grades. I took a job I didn't like that required minimal effort on my part. 

That led me down the path I find myself on today. Though I didn't admit it at the time, I was depressed. I leaned into smoking weed pretty much all the time. During that time, most of my extra cash (and a lot of not extra cash) went to buying copious amounts of weed. 

Fast forward a couple of years and I'm now in law school and the pandemic and isolation has made my habits far worse. At this point I'm basically smoking a 4th every 4 days or so. I can't afford this. Academically, financially, emotionally. I can't afford to keep smoking my days away. 

I feel like I am at precipice. I have tried quitting so many times, but this time it feels like it's important. I'm behind in school work, low on cash, and very worried about job prospects for the summer. I could go out and get some weed and not worry about this. But I don't want to anymore. And it's fucking hard to get my brain to stop rationalizing just one more buy. Just one more 4th to get through a few more days, then I'll deal with all my problems. 

To anyone who read all my diatribe, thanks. It means a lot just to be heard.

I got a new job in a city I've been wanting to move to and am officially approved for an apartment! It'll be the first time I have a place of my own so I'm nervously excited. It feels like when I decided to go sober everything started falling into place for me.

I think the biggest change is that I finally feel over a lot of the pain and heartaches I've been struggling with over the last few years. Smoking helped me to escape it in the moment, but I never really spent time processing things and considering how I deserve better than I was treated. It gave me a period of time to reflect and consider myself, to see that I'm worth more, and that I can overcome obstacles rather than needing to dull myself to them. I may be misremembering, but I believe there's an effect of long term usage of THC where you essentially get stuck in a mental loop. It makes it harder to process ideas in a new way. That was torture for trying to overcome some of the traumas I've been through, and already I feel myself more confident and prepared to move on. Who knows, maybe that's just confidence from sticking with sobriety-- either way, I'm all about it.

Long time lurker here. Reaching out to hopefully hear from people who have experienced something similar and have some suggestions or helpful perspectives to share. 

I've stopped in the past but have never committed to quitting like I am now. I'm just done. Earlier this week was my 38th birthday and I realized I've been getting high for nearly 20 years. I'm excited to move forward and figure out who I am without this crutch. But I'm really struggling with feeling guilty over having smoked for so long. 

I told myself I was a functional stoner but I know that it has impacted everything in my life. I feel like I'm 10 years behind where I should be professionally.  

I feel like most of the people I thought were my friends have given up on friendships with me because they just saw me as some lazy stoner that couldn't get their shit together. I feel like I would have distanced myself from myself if I was in their shoes. They say you are the average of the people you spend the most time with, and well, I feel like I would have brought everyone's average down. And now I feel so alone. My functional friends moved on, my stoner friends... well turn out getting high was about all we had in common. I used weed as a crutch to make friends, and now I realize I'm alone and don't even know how to have friendships. It makes me so sad. I'm so lonely. 

I used weed to cope with mental health issues: trauma, undiagnosed ADHD and possibly autism, depression, anxiety. It served me in that way. I come from a family of addicts. I've had to raise myself and learned maladaptive ways to cope like getting high and drinking. I've been sober from alcohol for nearly 3 years now and that has been a tremendous gift to myself and my future. Now it is time to cut ties with the only friend and coping mechanism I've consistently had for so long- cannabis. 

I try not to think about how getting high for so long has probably changed my brain for the worse, and damaged my body. I get so sad thinking about how I've hurt myself and held myself back. I want to forgive myself. I tell myself that I did the best I could up to this point and I took care of myself as best as I could with the crude tools I had available to me.

I've been going to therapy consistently for 3+ years now and doing so much work on myself. I really feel like I'm ready to move on from cannabis. Quitting this time has felt easier than it has in the past although I'm only on day 3. Cravings are minimal. I'm used to the withdrawal from the many times I've tried to stop in the past. I've decreased the amount I use consierably over the past year. Everytime I'd smoke I felt tremendous guilt. Fintally reached a tipping point and now the anger, regret, and guilt I feel over how I've made my life harder for myself is a big deterrent from using.

This past week was not too pleasant. Started getting headaches in the evenings, general grumpiness, and sleep quality hasn’t been the greatest. But I’ve been through this before, and I know that it will soon pass. Lots of water and quiet time has helped. Also reading and responding to posts on this sub has been a nice way to spread good vibes and encouragement. 

Taking daily walks and doing some strength training every other day to get my blood flowing and get some good old fashioned endorphins.

I’ve been thinking a lot about my lungs this week. Laying in bed, if i take a deep breath I can hear some whistling / wheezing sound, which is pretty troubling to me. Luckily I’m young (24) and I don’t think the damage is irreversible, but I’ve been seeking ways to try and restore my lung health beyond just quitting smoking. Went for a run this morning and made it about a mile before walking home, and then for about an hour after that I was occasionally coughing up some mucus (clear/yellowish, no black spots). I’m going to keep going for runs / doing more high intensity cardio, as it seems to be helping dislodge some of the mucus that has built up in my lungs after ripping (legal) carts for months and months. We’ll see if the wheeze / whistle sound eventually goes away.. I hope to god it does.. don’t want to end up with COPD or something :/

Anyways, that’s all for this week. TGIF this was a long hard week at work too! Thinking about going on some kind of a hike this weekend, catch up on some animes, do some early spring cleaning around my house, and maybe cop a new video game (Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury).

Hope y’all have a restful and enjoyable weekend!

I am at 60 days sober and can honestly say the last near two months I have felt better than I have in years. I’ve read many posts saying you are not likely to see or feel the benefits of what you are contemplating, or currently working on doing for months; some people have said six, but really I have not found this to be at all true and I think it would really be more constructive for more individuals to be as optimistic as possible instead of fear mongering. I smoked every day since 16 and I am now 21, without ever even a tolerance break - Of course the instant improvements, being my financial situation is very positive, though holding onto money doesn’t have an innate bearing on your well-being, I appreciate adjusting to sobriety can be a challenge. Here is the clutch, you have to put in effort to enact noticeable improvements, do not wait around for change.. Sleep was a worry and a difficulty - but I am better rested from a sober night's sleep therefore I can get up earlier - start with an hour, then another and another until you are up and active at a time that makes you happy with yourself. For me, I would lie in until sometimes past noon now after a few weeks I am up before 7am and have stuck with this for over a month (leaving me naturally tired at a reasonable time at night). Similarly, you have a lot of time on your hands, use it.. Whatever you do - work or hobby, set yourself manageable goals and see them through, be proud of yourself. My decision for sobriety came from wanting to achieve more and so this is what I am doing, start small but however you may feel, stick to your goals, every day. I seldom think about smoking now - because there are now tangible things in my life that are worth working hard for and that motivate me to do better. Certainly, I do not crave being high, again because it would be of detriment to the progress I have made. For fear of rambling on I will leave it at that, be positive and you will be surprised how quickly things turn around.",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5087739}"

The advice is to reward yourself for small milestones. That first week/ few days after you first quit is by far the toughest part, and what better way to get through it than by rewarding yourself with something you enjoy? 

When you come home from a long day and get that feeling of wanting to smoke, instead, you can reward yourself with something different that's not addicting. Personally I very rarely order wings, but when quitting, I made sure to order some hot wings for delivery and watch my favorite show. You can even justify it because you'll be saving so much money from quitting, this small investment is worth it.

So next time you're getting through the first few days and feel like you're about to break, try rewarding yourself for how far you've come instead. Order some of your favorite food for delivery, buy yourself a new game, some new clothes, anything that is a small investment compared to what smoking was.",236,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.81084514}"

For people unfamiliar, it’s about group of friends based in Leith ( Scotland) that are all addicted to heroin. The book takes you in the minds of characters, and they kinda explain why they take heroin. What’s interesting is how relatable there reasons for taking heroin is to my chronic use of weed. Boredom, depression, childhood trauma, a lack of connection with peers, that feeling of wanting to escape the responsibilities of life. Makes me realise that even a tame drug like weed can have the same self destructive consequences like harder drugs

I used to be a heavy smoker (first thing in the morning, throughout the day and a lot at night) I was easily smoking up to 15 joints a day for years straight. I’ve hit rock bottom with this multiple times until I decided to just stop. I’ve managed to quit for 60 days at the beginning of the pandemic but I relapsed hard for almost 6 months. I don’t know why but I feel something is different this time.

I’ve always dreamt of being capable of just taking hits with friends when they smoke and then go on with my life without being so tempted to buy and get high by self all the time. I’ve cried and prayed for this wondering why not me..then this past week end I had friends with whom I’ve smoked a little then my friend (that is well aware of my struggle with addiction) offered to leave me some hash and my first answer w/o even thinking was « no, thank you im good » I could see her surprised face and I was sooo happy with my self, it was pretty shocking. I didn’t crave it or feel the need to have more. 
Then I had another friend two days ago that came to my house and the same scenario happened. Before this I think I would’ve called my dealer to buy and it would send me back to the hell hole I was in, but now I just don’t want it..
I don’t want to get too excited and happy, I know im still vulnerable to the drug and still an addict but its like a shift has happened and I never want to go back to that loophole of hell.

I see a better life for myself on the other side.,"I have been a daily smoker of dabs for 5 years. I am proud to say that yesterday I gave away all my smoking stuff to a friend. For so long, my family and even friends would implore me to quit and I was too stubborn to listen. Nobody could tell me that weed was bad for me or that I shouldn't be smoking it. That has all changed for the following reasons:

I am graduating college this spring. I am applying to jobs right now, and for my field (finance), every job I am applying to will drug test. It is also possible I will be subjected to random drug tests even once I am employed. On top of that, some positions will require a security clearance, meaning they will know anything and everything about me. Bottom line- drugs are not allowed in this career path. I caught myself trying to think of a way around this- how can I smoke and also get a job? Maybe I'll just start my own business or find a job that doesn't drug test- and then it hit me: I was prioritizing weed, a drug, over my career. Think about how stupid that sounds.

I now realize that I don't want to be a stoner anymore. I don't want to be dependent on a drug to feel happy or relaxed. I don't want to feel perturbed when I'm low on wax and my plug doesn't have more for me. I don't want to cough my ass off all the time from smoking. I don't want to need an inhaler to breath normally when smoking makes me short of breath. I don't want to be scared shitless by the thought of getting caught with wax by a cop (in Texas that would mean a felony, $10K fine, and jail time, not to mention killing any chance of having a decent career). I want to have a professional career, and I am beginning to understand that in my field, the norm is that drugs aren't allowed and won't be tolerated.

So, here I am on day 2. I want to make sure I don't turn into an alcoholic, substituting one substance for another is not a sustainable solution. Anytime I want to smoke, I think about how I won't have the life I've envisioned for myself if I continue that lifestyle. I hope my perspective can help some of you.

Today I got offended when a girl I sorta liked and just met made me feel like my feelings are being used to her benefit only.  We have been chatting sporadically for three days kinda made me feel like I am being used. I made the stupid mistake of being infatuated with her and telling her. 

See, I am a typical nice guy with a girl I like. I don't know why, if the girl isn't someone I like as a person then my game is capable and I am pretty successful in that regard. If I like the girl I become a people pleasing love sick love struck fool.

Thing is, this girl has obviously been very hurt before. She has gone through hectic stuff and is still going through the most. Her trust levels and faith in men is like zero. She is emotionally unavailable that's for certain. 

Point is I told her I feel like she is using me. She got mad, said she isn't and promptly blocked me and told me never to message her again. 

Now, I regret that. I ought not to have told her how I feel? I don't know.

The point is, after that convo I almost lost my way. I felt like just going to buy weed and smoke because this always happens. Girls I really really like just don't like me back! This is like a theme in my life!

Luckily I received a call from my good friend around that time. He was going through something and he needed to talk to me. We spoke for over an hour about whatever we needed to and in the end I got so caught up in the convo that I forgot about my desire to go get weed and smoke due to the emotional pain I felt at being well rejected for telling someone how I feel.

I thought about it and said it was not worth throwing away 5 days of progress and sobriety over a girl I had met for all of 3 hours and who clearly didn't really like me Enough to stop and read my message that I felt she was using me ( the signs were there, when a woman is interested she is interested you can tell by the way she acts toward you, when it's the opposite then you are only good enough to be spoken to when she needs something from you) and she then got mad or offended because I said I feel like she is using me!

It was a long stressful day at work as well. 

Thankfully I went to a zoom support group meeting instead this afternoon. It is a group created by the rehab I was in. I have not been to a meeting since I had relapsed in July 2020. It was amazing to be back there and I felt really good after sharing. 

Thing is I am now regretting my words. I was in an emotional space this morning but that's how I felt at the time and I had to say it as I felt it. I had hoped she would respond better.

What do you guys think? Did I do the right thing? Should I just stop over thinking this, accept it and carry on. 

Its causing me alot of anxiety and it's messing with my craving to smoke. I don't like feeling like this but at the same time if I smoke I am not gonna process what happened to me and I will have thrown away all the hard good work i have put in.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67379797}"

(Sorry about typos, I dictated this to my phone so it was faster.)

Hello everyone. I’ve lurked this forum for a long time. But this is my first time posting. Let me give you a little background.

I’m 38, and I think I have smoked since I was about 20. At first it was like most people, smoking here and there, smoking when you were with friends. Eventually I started buying my own little baggies, and within a year or so I was smoking pretty much every day all day.

At first I liked it. I enjoyed the high. The mental space it put me in I felt gave me such ideas and creativity and made me wonder about the world in ways I never had before. I loved weed.

This feeling lasted for the better part of a decade or more. But I was also beginning to notice signs that perhaps marijuana was affecting my life negatively, but I ignored it, because I wanted to smoke.

I’ve always been an anxious person, even before I smoke. When I was younger I remember having panic attacks, so at the time I didn’t know that’s what it was. I had my first real panic attack some years after I started smoking pot. It happened when I was driving home from a hookah bar, and I remember a sudden feeling of just thinking everything was coming to an end, something was horribly wrong, and I had to pull over and let my girlfriend at the time continue driving me home.

My life was never quite the same after that and I spent a couple years walking around in a giant fog that consumed me, but I continue to smoke through all of this, thinking the weed would help my anxiety. From where I am now in life I wonder if it was the weed that actually caused a severe panic attack and the fog in the first place.

Fast forward to 2016. I had been living in Washington state for three years. And now had access to legal weed with much higher concentrations of THC. I would find myself smoking 22%, 30%, and higher percentages of THC. I thought it was all going well and then I had my first major trauma in my life.

On December 30, 2016 my wife dropped and had a seizure right in front of me out of nowhere, it was the most horrifying thing I’ve ever witnessed. One day later my mom called to tell me she had breast cancer. My anxiety you can imagine is through the roof. And I kept smoking marijuana through all of this.

Eventually, five months later after my wife’s seizures started, I began having daily heart palpitations. By palpitations I mean every third beat my heart would Skip. It did this for a year solid, pretty much from one birthday to the next. I thought I was going to die, I thought I was fucked. I knew it had to be stress related, but I also wondered if I was just unlucky and had a bad heart.

At first I equated it to the severe stress, remember I said that I was an anxious person and had dealt with that all my life, and I thought this was something that I just was not capable of handling. And I thought it was going to kill me. I even went to doctors had an echocardiogram and stress test and all other tests. The doctor said other than an extra beat here and there I was fine I just needed to get some exercise. I know for many of you this sounds very familiar.

During this time I did try to lower my intake of marijuana, and I started to notice a correlation between how severe my heart palpitations would be, and when I smoke. I struggled greatly since then and wavered between smoking and wanting to stop smoking, but not being able to, because the pot I felt made me calm. But that was just a lie I told myself, I now understand.

Later that year in 2017 my wife’s step mom passed away suddenly, and then a few months after that her cat that she had had since She was young passed away. Needless to say 2017, between personal issues and trauma and political issues, was one of the most difficult years of my life, and I had heart palpitations through it all.

Fast forward to this year - my heart palps now are maybe once or twice a day, maybe going weeks without feeling anything. But I have developed a phobia of my heart health, I find myself constantly checking it. I have tried three or four times to stop smoking, one time becoming successful for nearly a month and a half, but again I relapsed and began smoking, and smoking higher concentrations of THC, though I told myself I never would again.

I was beginning to think, and I hope that I am correct, perhaps all of my heart palpitations, my major anxiety, my depression, my inability to deal with trauma, all boiled down to a multi-decade long addiction to marijuana.

Over the last few weeks, I have switched to smoking lower THC, 7%. My hope was that I could handle this much lower dose and can eventually taper off. It didn’t take long, just a few days, for me to feel my anxiety and my body tension rise even with this low dose of THC. I was realizing I just had the plane stop, there was no question about it, The marijuana was definitely what was making me feel like shit. It had turned on me.

So I have decided, after more than 15 years of smoking daily, 4 to 5 bowls a day. Yesterday was my full day sober. And last night sucked. I woke up at 5:30 in the morning with anxiety and attention in my body that I almost couldn’t stand. I hope this is temporary. I hope this is not my life.

I have stopped before in the past and never felt what I would consider to be with drawl symptoms, but they sure seem to be hitting me now. Headaches, lightheadedness, anxiety, body tension, fast heart rate, feeling like I’m going to crawl out of my skin. I have read many times that this is a temporary sensation, even if it lasts a few months, but that it does go away. But when you’re in the middle of feeling it it never feels like it will go away it feels like this is who you are.

I don’t want to be the person that I have been these last 15+ years anymore. I realized I don’t really know who I am without marijuana, I have no clue who I am, and that is a strange realization. I don’t want that feeling anymore, I want to become something, I want to become somebody.

Over the last month my doctor put me on blood pressure medicine, but I feel my blood pressure is the result of the last four years of dealing with a severe trauma, mild PTSD, and the anxiety induced by smoking pot. High blood pressure does not run in my family, and I have never had it before. So I hope it is all related.

I have started to turn my life around, I am exercising 30+ minutes a day, I am eating healthier, I am no longer going to smoke. I promised that to the world and to myself and to my loved ones, we all deserve that.

I’m not really sure why I am sharing this, somehow I hope it makes me feel better, I hope it puts it into the world and perhaps other people can relate and see themselves in the story. I hope that I will get better. I hope that I have not messed myself up permanently. I hope I have a reason to hope.

Yesterday was my first day sober. I am excited to find the new me, to get to know me, know what I am capable of without the effects of marijuana dragging me down.

I never would’ve thought that I would stop smoking marijuana, I felt it was going to be something I would do until the day I die as an old man. I never thought that one of the substances I enjoy the most in life would become the thing that could ruin my life.

For everyone out there is trying to stop, I wish you the best, and I am proud of you. It’s not easy, and I thought it would be, but that doesn’t mean it is not worth doing. I know I have a long road ahead of me with the with the withdrawals, I hope that it is worth it I hope I can become better, I hope I can reclaim my health.

This post is my promise that I give to myself, but I will not give up, but I will overcome by addiction to marijuana. Good luck everyone, we are all in this together.

If anyone wants to give me some advice or relate, I’m all ears - I need the peer support, I need to be reassured I’m not alone.

TL/DR: I have smoked pot for over 15+ years, and due to some recent traumas in my life I noticed how much the pot just drove my anxiety through the roof, which intern affected my health severely, and now I am trying to stop smoking. My first day sober was yesterday, and I am hoping for tomorrow and the rest of the days that follow will continue in a positive direction, I hope that I can get through this.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4265024}"

I have a huge problem with weed. It’s been like that for a decade now. I’ve quit “for real” 3 times in the last 3 years. Each one ended in relapse and always a big and long lasting one. 

I find it so hard to claw my way out of this pit and just so easy to get pulled back down despite trying to grip the wall and really find my way out to see the light. 

This is my 4th quit. I just know that weed isn’t serving me anymore. I want to be free. 

The problem is that I live with my partner in the same house, and he does not feel the same way and doesn’t plan to quit smoking. Today is my second day sober and this morning (after a restless and tough no sleep night last night) my partner says to me “____ gave me a doobie last night at work” and then something along the lines of how he will probably smoke it later. I honestly don’t know if he forgot my situation but it instantly pissed me off so much. He apologized but I felt like he was being sooo insensitive to my raw and vulnerable form and it made me feel so disconnected from him and angry at him. I still feel really hurt and (i think) I know that that is partly due to rough withdrawals and my subsequent emotional instability.

I’m just looking for someone who is in a similar boat to empathize with me and maybe give me some tips on how to better deal. This shit is hard. I feel really misunderstood.

Then I met a girl on tinder and she wanted to try getting high for the second time ever (first time was with some of her friends) on our second date. We had no idea this was the start of a ritual.

Every time she would come over, we’d eventually get high at some point. It was such a magical feeling to be go through this new world of being high with someone. Having high sex, satiating our munchies, going on whimsical adventures, laughing about anything and everything, diving into deep discussions, rewatching old cartoons, listening to music while holding each other, playing video games. I had never felt so happy before that. It felt like we were in our own little pocket of time and space.

I do feel like weed had taught us both a lot, and I don’t regret what we did. Those memories are sacred to me. Eventually, we went deeper and partook in something very spiritual together that I’m forced to be vague about due to a rule on this sub that is automatically moderated based on keywords. This event forever changed our lives for the better, and I know this wouldn’t have happened if we never smoked.

But eventually, I quit smoking because of anxiety and she didn’t. I went through a month of hell, depressed and sleepless, and the thing that broke me the most was that she would likely go through this hell too if she ever decided to stop. I remember sitting wide awake on the couch at 4am, a familiar setting for me thanks to withdrawals, alone with my thoughts. I cried and cried, hating myself at the time for ever getting her into smoking. I was especially scared reading certain accounts of PAWS and was terrified I might have fucked her life up.

For the next few months, I struggled with the remnants of withdrawals, which were extended because I eventually did go back to smoking but only once or twice a week. This was enough to make me tired all the time though, and this made it tough to deal with covid, a mid-pandemic abortion in a backwards southern state, and supporting my girlfriend through her best friend’s suicide. The withdrawals had me so listless that I’m sure sometimes it seemed like I didn’t give a fuck about any of that, and it haunts me that those impressions are likely stuck in her brain forever.

Eventually, we broke up for unrelated reasons. She said she woke up one day feeling like a completely different person, and I didn’t feel like it was just one of those excuses, considering her mental health history and the fact that her personality felt so suddenly different. She ended things because she felt like she couldn’t be who she was anymore, even though two weeks prior she was crying about having to spend time apart from me during the holidays. Smoking daily had unmissable consequences on my mental health, so today I still fear that weed might have played a part in this transformation of hers. 

It’s been nearly three months now. I saw her the other day because we had to return some things to each other, but also she requested a dab pen. As I handed it to her, I could only hope she’s just one of those people who can just manage getting high, doing so without detrimental mental health effects, and stopping without severe withdrawals. Her life is far more on track than mine despite me being sober though; it’s only the shift in personality that concerns me. But now that we’re split, hoping and wishing is all I can do. That was probably the last time I’ll ever see her, and things ended the way they began: with a little dab pen.",6,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5245439}"

That was in 2010. I have been smoking every day since. Started as just an after school thing, then skipping school or lunch to go smoke. Eventually I got caught and expelled from the school and sent to a alternative school which was pretty much junior jail. 

Now I am an adult with my own place. I wake up late,, instantly smoke. All day every day. Not only that im smoking live resin..flower doesn't get me high anymore. When i had a job, i was always a star employee but if i could find a way to smoke, i would. Now that im on unemployment it has gotten out of control. I have never been so depressed and overweight. I have never been so fogged up in my head. The depression has been there for a while but never this bad. 

Im contently feeling extremely exhausted with lack of energy.  Feeling sick to my stomach daily which constant migraines.  I smoke more thinking it helps when in reality its probably the problem. Sometimes it helps. 

I cant sleep without it. Well thats how it used to be anyway. Now I just can't sleep. 

I moved to Colorado 5 years ago for college and weed. Chose weed which made me not as motivated for college. Started second guessing everything and never knew what I wanted. I felt so fucking lost. 

Finally with the pressure of unemployment ending soon, my lease ending soon and no job, somehow I got the slightest motivation to apply for fasfa and the trade school I've been looking for and start on the 15th to be a diesel tech.  Im excited but keep getting waves of exhaustion even thinking of doing anything. 

I'm so exited im doing something. I tried to read and study some stuff before school started just so I could be ahead but I couldn't even focus without getting I migraine and having to just stop everything and try to sleep or puke. 

Im starting to think I really need to fucking let it go and quit. I never thought I'd say that. I love weed. How am I suppose to just give up something that has been the solution for so many years? 

Props to all of you who have done it. Im not sure i can.",15,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37858438}"

Maybe one day I can go back to moderate use, but right now I need it out of my life for the foreseeable future. 

I’ve never had crazy withdrawals when trying to quit, even though I’ve been smoking multiple times daily for two years. To be honest, I don’t feel much different besides some irritability, trouble sleeping and general cravings. Helps that I just threw it all out, now I can’t smoke even if I wanted to and it makes it easier to ignore and forget about it. 

Of course I still feel like I “want” to smoke, but I know that’s my addiction talking. Just struggling with the forever aspect of quitting, even though I’m taking it one day at a time, it still feels like something I will inevitably turn back to. Hopefully that feeling will go away eventually. This is my first time quitting for an undetermined time, every time before this was just a long T-break with an end date in sight.

Massive massive brain fog and general lethargy... intense irritability and negativity, especially later in the day which is when I would consume. 

But I will endure. Shooting for two months. Reasons for quitting are lack of motivation, inability to articulate thoughts and ideas, inability to focus. I aspire to be a full-time composer and hope to earn an income from my music and performance. After going to the gym in the morning then working all day, I’d consume later in the day then try to continue my studies and musical works which was futile. It felt like there was no motivation whatsoever even though I know music is my essence and my future. Hoping this new lifestyle approach will get me there but this is not easy at all.

I’m a bit nervous posting here, but I told myself when I ran out of weed I would quit for good. Fuck this shit, it turns all the little things that nag me into glaring problems, and makes me overly anxious. I can’t even function around my friends when I get high so I get high alone. It has kept my family and relationships at bay indirectly, mostly by making me feel numb to any emotion other than some truly crippling anxiety. I’m done.

I recently moved to a non legal state, and I have no plugs here - hopefully the barrier of entry will help me stay clean. I’ve been smoking since 19, now am 21 and the last year and a half have been smoking pretty heavy on and off. Things also got pretty fucked after I had a terrifying experience with a non prescription drug, and weed has been different since then. 

I used to feel like it was helping my depression, but now I feel like it adds to it. But here’s the kicker. Part of me wants to stay depressed and addicted because it’s easier. And it’s a safe existence, sadness has always been able to carry me through life in a comforting way. Idk if I’m fucked up or if it’s the weed or the non prescription drug I spoke of earlier.

Part of the reason I’m posting here is for posterity sake, so I can look back to see how I was when I was smoking weed. Another reason is that I don’t know if I can do it.

One of the reasons I’m quitting is because my friend turned me on to Naruto. For the uninitiated, Naruto is an anime about a kid that doesn’t quit, no matter what the stakes are. His determination sparked something inside me to make me want to be like him, and have the strength to fight for what I believe in.

This is my adopted nindo, my creed I will live by.

He was handsome, caring, silly, philosophical, a connoisseur of of delightful madness, and the first friend who got me high . 

""Yo man, when are you finally gonna smoke weed with me? You keep giving me excuses!"" he grinned with twinkling eyes. I wanted to try weed but I was an anxious 18 year old, scared of spazzing or even more embarrassingly, not doing it right . 

""Trust me. If you smoke with me, my friend, you will get high"" he laughed carelessly.

 My anxiety gave way to my trust in him and a desire for adventure. That night he took me to the ""G-Spot"", the camera and campus-cop free area in the woods right next to the neighboring Catholic school. We smoked weed out of an apple and despite the rumbles and complaints of his two stoner best friends, he let me smoke without passing, until I felt good.  When I finally ""felt it"" I laughed until tears ran down my face. What a joy to feel so alive, to feel the entire world for the first time in a way that was so pure and spiritually vibrant. I could see in color after a life of seeing in black and white! 

14 years later and the magic is completely gone. The only place I can find it with Marijuana is in my memory. My last ""break and binge"" left me feeling lower than I have in recent memory. I was already in a two week long depressive episode but the weed helped me dig my brain deeper down until I was struggling to find any hope for the future. I have three days in but unlike all the other times I have stopped, I don't have plans to buy after I achieve a certain number of days. I'm taking it a step at a time. But for the first time in 14 years I'm leaving without return plans. 

The first 10 years of weed smoking were problem free and casual. I smoked weed with friends, rarely ever bought unless for special occasions, and never smoked it every day. I had no ""guy"" saved in my phone. I could take two puffs of a bowl and feel amazing for the rest of the evening. One night in 2012 I smoked after coming back from a jujitsu class. My friend and I rolled in the grass and laughed about the Carl Sagan quote ""we are the universe experiencing itself."" We felt it to be deeply true and hollered with delight. ""I am going to be the universe experiencing a sandwich in five minutes"" I laughed while gasping for breath.  

The magic stopped in 2017. It was the year of new stoner friends and the Era of the Spliff, which eventually ferried me into becoming an everyday smoker. On New Years day my friends and I smoked more weed than I ever have in my life. For a full day a new spliff was rolled every 20 minutes or so. My new stoner friends were not phased but I though ""How am I able to smoke this much without losing my head?"" 

With my new friends and stressful job I started to smoke everyday. We took turns doing weed runs and my phone had a few new ""guys"" saved in it. Every time we hung out we smoked. My roommates and I started to buy a house stash so we could smoke when the other friends weren't around. Eventually we started fighting over how much of the stash was being used by individuals. At some point, tired of the fighting I started using those numbers in my phone to buy my own. When I traveled for work I found ways to make sure I always had weed. In the legal states I bought pre-rolls and felt like a king. In illegal states I found new guys within a few days.

The days when I didn't have any started to feel rotten.  My sleep started  to suck. My depression and anxiety seemed to be higher than usual. It amplified my need to track some down. The amount of space thinking about weed took up in my brain increased. I would smoke first thing after work until bedtime. I had faint mental rumblings that something was up but I brushed them aside. 

""I have a job that I'm good at and that I think is important! I never go to work high! If anything it helps me reset for my next anxiety-inducing day at work!"" 

In March of 2020, due to the pandemic, I lost my job. 

At first the experience of all the time at home was novel. I read a ton of books! I worked on music! I had a stoner Friend with Benefits who was the most beautiful woman I had ever been with! She would come over in the evenings and we would smoke a millions joints and have the best sex of my life. But soon the novelty wore off and my schedule and sense of purpose were decimated. I struggled to find meaning and a routine. I started smoking weed at 2 or 3pm until I went to bed. Somedays I would wake and bake and cruise till I slept. But when thing remained constant. It was Every. Single. Day. 

My mental state started to fry. My roommates and I started fighting. We no longer even shared rolling papers with each other. We fought over minutia and started accusing each other of acting with malicious motives. I eventually snapped at my friend with benefits. ""All we do is smoke weed and I just sit hear listening to you talk about being an essential worker. We never have had sex sober! You are more hooked on this shit than I am!"" We made up after the fight but she left and found a boyfriend. I started lying to myself about the weed use.   

""If I smoke a few spliffs now I'll spend the rest of the afternoon making music or crack the new book.""

""It can only make you feel better, given this fucked up situation.""

""So and So smokes more weed and they are doing fine!"" 

""It doesn't matter what I do. America is more fucked than I am with this virus!""

I would wake feeling like an empty husk. All I could see was a string of never ending days that all felt identical. I was lost in a doomed-out perma-haze. I had to get out of my house. For a while I stayed with my parents to quarantine but I had only brought enough weed to last a few days. Eventually I ran out. It was good chance to clear my head, I thought.

""I'll give myself a tolerance break since I don't have anymore"" I told myself. ""This will be a nice little mental reset!""

But it wasn't nice at all. I barely slept for the next four days. I felt irritable, depressed, anxious, and hopeless. I left my parents house earlier than expected. This was probably the worst experience I could have had because since that event I was afraid to quit smoking weed. The thought of four nights of tossing and turning made my stomach feel ill. I decided that I would simply have to smoke through the rest of the pandemic if I wanted to sleep. 

In August I lied to a doctor about migraines and got a medical marijuana card. I had four ""guys"" in my phone and a Med Card. The weather started to turn and I braced for the worst winter of my life. It was a winter of mental doom. My schedule was even more fucked and I couldn't kill time by biking around the city or visiting friend's backyards. All my problems seemed to get worse. My car was hit when a friend borrowed it for a construction gig. I was trapped and getting into worse roommate fights. I was shaking with anxiety but smoking through it.

Last week, when the weather started to turn, I felt no carpe-diem joy. I felt like the world had left me behind somewhere dark while it moved forward for spring. I wasn't suicidal but I thought a lot about death and what a relief it might be. I did a weeklong break out of desperation and told myself from now on I'll be a weekends only smoker. I smoked my weekend away and felt like death. I smoked the last of my week on Sunday and thought ""something needs to change"". This Monday was one the most depressing days of my life. I had zero hope. Empty-shell man. I told myself the feeling would pass but barely believed it. I slogged through Monday with no weed but importantly no plans to buy it.

On Tuesday I woke up and felt better than I had in months. The previous week's break allowed me to sleep despite my weekend binge and I felt alive for the first time in a long time. I did all of my chores and finished all of the goals I set for myself. I even started applying to a course for the summer so I can be even more experience in my field. I am looking forward to vaccinations and getting my life back on track. On my first day with no weed plans I finally tasted spring. 

I know the games I've played over the years about T breaks. This time truly feels different. I reached out to some sober friends and had long discussions. Those discussions made me realize so much about myself and my patterns. I was told about this subreddit so I made a reddit account tonight. I am writing this for accountability to myself and I empathetically hopes it resonates with some of you. 

When I told my friend on the phone tonight I was afraid of being sober forever he told something that really helped. 

""You don't have to be sober forever today. You just gotta be sober today, man."" 

I'm feeling good about being sober today.

Hello, I am a 20 10/12ths year old male and I recently quit smoking weed, I smoked since I was about 14 and a half, and I quit because I got an offer I just couldn't turn down, my uncle works in a major tech company in a high senior position, and he offered to help me learn to do software engineering and potentially make over $100k a year once I finish studying.

I decided that the best option to be able to actually focus on work in the long term, and be successful I should quit weed for good, but I didn't realize how bad the effects of withdrawal would be.

I tried to quit for about 10 days, failed, and then tried again, failed, and then got extremely angry at the fact I wouldn't quit, and told my mom that I had a problem, smashed my pipes and essentially poisoned the remainder of my weed, the first few weeks were great, then suddenly I started having crushing suicidal depression, horrific nightmares, and an inability to focus on my studies.

I have no one to talk about this with, I am extremely socially anxious and I really only talk with 2 of my life long friends, and a couple of people that I met as a dev on roblox, and none of them are former addicts.

I feel so alone, I have not studied properly in over 3 weeks and I feel like my uncle hates me, I am not willing to admit to him that I am an addict trying to quit, but I just know that I seem like I'm just trying to avoid studying, I don't want to talk about it with my friends because it would just instantly kill the mood of any voice call we are in, but I have no one to turn to, if I talk about it they just all go silent and I feel insanely guilty for dumping it on them.

I might just be being a drama queen, I might just be making a mountain out of a mole hill, but I just feel so alone and scared, I have a chance to do better in life than most of my family, but I feel like I am squandering it by just being lazy.

I don't have the ability to buy weed anymore thankfully, so relapse isn't exactly an option, but I am turning 21 in 2 months and after that I could just walk into a store and buy it, and I am afraid that I am going to ruin my life, I just don't know what to do, I don't know where to go, I don't want to fail my uncle, I don't want to lose this chance I have at a better life, I won't even need to go to college and I could make over a hundred thousand dollars a year, yet I just can't get myself to just work.

I can't just smoke in moderation, my family has a huge history of addiction, if I try to I will end up smoking until I feel like I am no longer in my body, and software engineering requires a LOT of focus, so I can't do both.

I know I’ve even said that phrase several times, often in the context of trying to justify my addiction while implying that everybody has some problematic behavior/habit that they know isn’t right but that they partake in nonetheless.

And? What fool would accept this statement? I guess I am, or I was until recently. Why should you be okay with – or worse, even proud of – having a vice?

Life is short. I get that some folks adopt a hedonistic mindset where feeling good and submitting to pleasure at any cost is how they want to live. Fine. But, when you openly admit that it truly is a “vice,” that’s your conscience speaking, and saying that you know it’s wrong. And if you know it’s wrong, why continue?

I guess it’s scary to give up a vice. It’s become so intertwined with your behavior and your way of dealing with life’s challenges. And when society keeps telling you over and over that everyone has vices, that everyone’s a slave to something, it’s hard to muster up the courage to think about what life could look like without it.

But please, I beg you, listen to your conscience. You know what’s right and what’s wrong. You control your hands and your legs, and you can stop yourself from picking up that pipe.

I’ve never posted on here before, but I’ve definitely used this community and these posts to help me get sober.

From reading various posts here, I just felt like I needed to put out this encouragement. I’ve learned this from professional addiction therapists and psychiatrists, and I thought it might bring someone some comfort...

A relapse is not a restart. A relapse is not throwing away all of your work or what you have learned. A relapse isn’t even a failure, and you shouldn’t look at it that way!

A relapse can be an incredibly positive thing IF you use it to REAFFIRM what you have learned. Meaning, you have to see your relapse as a mistake, and not a re-addiction. You can still get right back on the path of sobriety, where you were! The relapse is just showing you exactly WHY YOU QUIT IN THE FIRST PLACE!! It doesn’t feel good, because YOU HAVE ALREADY DECIDED YOU WANT SOMETHING BETTER! Don’t forget how POWERFUL that step is! It hasn’t been undone, and it should be celebrated!

So for anyone out there who has relapsed and is struggling... DONT BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF FAM :)) you haven’t unlearned the lessons of sobriety you previously knew. You haven’t undone your work you put in before or negated it, because you STILL did that!!

Drank tea that is specific for relaxation/stress relief (says it on the box) throughout the day

Kept my mind occupied with things that take focus like reading manga

Observed my thoughts. Distanced myself from my thoughts. By this I mean instead of just accepting your craving say “this is a craving from addiction, this is not me, it is my addiction)

Using computer games, music, sugar and caffeine to soothe myself. My mother was my closest confidant, and while she fought to keep her new relationship going. She had less time for me. I was 15. Short, fat, nerdy and socially insecure. I spent way too much time comforting my mother, and in the process discovering her poor upbringing. Looking back, I was being neglected and traumatized in a similar manner to my mother. I was just a kid, way in over his head trying to be helpful to my mother and little brother that I loved and still do above all else. This left me feeling lonely. Alienated by people.

 I power on the next few years. I go to my grandparents place to relax after school cause I didn't feel well at home. I've spent countless hours on that light-green couch trying to get some rest and emotional support from my grandma. 
I try finishing my education. First, trade school which I didn't finish cause I despaired at being lonely in that line of work. I got a therapist cause ""I couldn't feel anything"". And later, university. I had my first taste of weed at 20, One year into my ba in philosophy. I get friends who seem to enjoy the same things other than computer games. People who liked  politics, history and philosophy to the extent of reading books or articles like I did. Kind of friends I've never had before. I take an effort to lose weight and succeed. Life was looking good, but at the back of my mind the impostor syndrome and the lingering emptiness.

 The studies required more of me and I feel less and less interested in the courses my uni had to offer. What would I even use this degee for anyway. I took part in student participation at my institute and got to see modern  academia in action. It disgusted me and I got really discouraged continuing. At the start of my last year, I moved in with a friend who was smoking a lot more than me, and I quickly found we shared the same disenchantment with the world and ourselves. And my own smoking eventually matched his. I struggled to finish and cut my losses. But I was so fucked up in the end, I just wanted the world to burn, everything to fall apart. I told myself over and over: I don't care. I had to  move home to my grandparents and I didn't know what to do. I bounced between temp jobs and unemployment and then corona hit. I started to lurk r/leaves cause I deep down knew nothing will change if I didn't stop the habit. Yet I couldn't see anything worthwhile to change for.

 I get a new therapist and he says he doesn't care if I smoke, but I should be able to bring my A game into the sessions. And thats what I tried to do. Suddenly I have a person I can talk to about everything. Despite all my mental gymnastics, I've come to the understanding which I currently express in this post. For a long time I believed I had to settle for weed, working out and working temp jobs. Regardless of what I believe, experience goes to show I haven't had my needs met for almost half my life. 

Ever since my breakdown I haven't wanted weed once. I have cigarettes and I will probably stop smoking alltogether soon. 
I want to feel love, I want purpose, I want to create. But first I gotta not be so fucking tired, cause that is what I'm currently dealing with. Just awfully tired.

On the first page of the chapter that is the day when I first met you,
Appear the words, 'Here begins a new life'. 

- Dante, La Vita Nuova

I first heard this quote not from some overly obsessive compulsion to read Italian poetry, but from the Star Trek: Voyager episode “Latent Image”.

It speaks to me now more than ever. Originally written as an expression of courtly-style love, this text takes on a different meaning. 

The day when I first met and accepted my destiny of sobriety has begun a new life. I am more present, more aware, more grounded, less angry, less impulsive, and more empathetic. 

It has not (and I recognize it will not) be easy. I’ve had to face challenges in the last 4 months. Life doesn’t stop when you quit smoking weed. Depending on your religious or philosophical position - God, The Universe, or just plain Life decides that right about now is a good time to “build character”. 

I’m not angry or broken, though. Through the difficulty in my marriage (that I caused, mind you), to the sudden loss of my Mom last month, to the anxiety around the pandemic, to the stress from work, to everything else going on — I’m still here. Not only am I still here, I’m still sober. 

I’m so grateful and thankful that I’m not high, or drunk, or buzzed. I managed to kick the booze 5 years ago, but I hung on to weed until 4 months ago. I kicked cigarettes 3 years ago. I met with my Pastor who is speaking at my Mom’s service, and after sharing these things with him he said with a bemused tone, “you’re still having sex, right?”  I didn’t want to get into it at the time, so I untruthfully replied, “of course!”

Truth is, because weed caused me to become complacent and just...so angry, I damaged my relationship with my wife pretty badly. We’re working on things and the progress is good. I honestly don’t blame her though—I wouldn’t want to have sex with me either until I could fully trust that anger wouldn’t come back and snap at me. I know we’ll get there and I’m certainly not going to rush things. 

This is all to demonstrate that quitting is possible. Think it’ll be fun? Yeah, it won’t be. But what you’ll gain is far more valuable than any substance or temporary high. Think of it as assessment and selection for sobriety. God, The Universe, whatever — knows that you’re ready for sobriety now. The challenges and hardship might sometimes be so severe that it’s difficult to put into words - but we got this. 

As Calvin’s Dad in “Calvin and Hobbes” remarked, “diarrhea builds character”. It’s in our most miserable and challenging times we truly discover what we’re really made of.

The beginning of the pandemic is when I started smoking regularly as a way to self-medicate for my anxiety.

Fast-forward to several weeks ago. I had been clean for a little over a week, and then the weekend came around and I thought I could handle one night of relaxing with some edibles. Well I took one, then another, and then suddenly I realized I had lost almost an entire week, being stoned pretty much constantly. I barely even left my apartment. I didn’t work (I’m self-employed), wasted a whole bunch of money on takeout/delivery, and I can’t even remember much of it.

Before I even started smoking, I’d occasionally have periods like this due to some particularly bad depressive episodes. I’d spend entire weeks in bed, either sleeping or binging TV/games and shitty food, unable to face the world or even cook. The issue with weed for me is that it makes all of these things sooo much more enjoyable. So if I fall into a depressive episode, I start thinking “well if this is already happening, I might as well get some edibles and enjoy it a bit more”. 

However, recently an even bigger issue has appeared - getting high can kickstart a depressive episode. My high mindset is oddly similar to a depressed mindset: kind of numb, not really caring about much, content to just stay in my bed until the end of time. And if I’m already laying down, eating junk food, and watching a movie due to being high, it’s super easy for me to just slip back into those destructive patterns. Add in the feeling of comfort, contentment, and laziness that I get from weed, and it gets even harder to pull myself out of the cycle. And when I finally do pull myself out and make the choice to stop using weed, my anxiety flares back up with a vengeance, making it even more likely that I’ll just fall back into another bad depressive episode. 

If you have anxiety and/or depression and you’re using weed to self-medicate for one or both of them like I was, be careful. It might just be the perfect way to make sure you never actually get better.


Side note:  I’ve been clean for a few days now and for the first time I’ve started looking for a therapist, so hopefully recognizing this dangerous pattern is the first step to making some lasting positive changes.",27,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.583251}"

I remember being introduced to weed. My parents knew I’d find out about it on the streets - so they offered me before I could say yes to any “delinquent” outside influences. They dimmed the lights, lit some incense and played a vinyl record of Pink Floyd and we sat in silence. It was the first time I ever truly knew peace in my life. 

I don’t know what happened. Weed was there for me for so long and suddenly, she just wasn’t my friend anymore. She became a foe, disguised as a lover. 

She still is. I know I have to leave her. She is no longer a healer, but a toxin. That is my fault. I used her. I abused her so often that she turned on me. 

She is no longer my friend. She no longer helps me experience life with a heightened sense of joy or pleasure. Instead, life now passes me by while I remain tightly clutched in her hands. 

Her smoke suffocates my chest and encases my brain in a never ending thick fog. Yet I choose this. Every day. I do not have to. She does not tell me to come back. She does not hold the match. I do. 

I am grieving before I have even let her go. 

I know that once I have let her go, I can never invite her home again. If I do, I will be unable to treat her with kindness and respect. I will just use and abuse her again, and she will retaliate. It is a justified cycle that I have to break out of.

Im 6 months clean and have noticed that a lot of my issues are imaginary. E.g an imagined past or imagined future. All problems arise in the now, and all problems I've handled in the now.  

Weed however made me live in my head for well over a decade. Even when I wasn't high I was living in an almost constant daydream.   

Now I'm not saying that everyone is the same, but for me smoking weed enhances the fantasy/daydream world which can be your best friend or worst enemy depending on the content.   

I'm also not saying daydreaming or fantasising is bad - if it's done at an appropriate time, and it's not destructive.  

However getting high made me live in an almost fictitious world of drama and emotion that wasn't grounded in this reality. Things that went wrong in the past played over and over, or rehersing future 'what ifs' on an endless loop.

I am clean, I sleep so much better (sleep normalized in about 5 days, I was worried because when I quitted weed last time I hade nightmares and night sweats for 2 weeks, but I was smoking strong weed day in and day out for months that time) , I completely forgot how great dreaming is and how awesome is to wake up rested.  
My productivity is way up, I am happier, and I lost about 5kg (11 lbs) because I quit snacking.

I have also given alcohol a pause, so that helped to.

Today is the first day I've been sober since the end of January when I said I would quit. And I did. For a month. My New Years Resolution: Quit smoking weed, start a Youtube channel, write more songs, write more fiction...I'm new to this sub but I'm sure all of this is already sounding familiar. 

This year alone I've gotten high no less than 60 times. I've been a daily user since college, but I've been smoking more since Covid hit. First it was just getting faded at night, then during the day, then at work. Each step normalized the one that preceded it until getting up and burning the day away felt like going through the motions. 

There have been so many last hurrah smoking sessions. So many one more joints. I've even limited myself to not buying it, but then not a day later I'm scraping the surfaces of my grinder looking for any residue I can recycle for another high. 

I don't even have bad influences I'm just full of excuses. It's not like my friends are all stoners too. We are all successful people in our 20's making and so I feel equally self justified and ashamed of the habit. Here's the thing. For so long I felt like as long as my career was progressing then my life was too. I'm 27 making good money, I have great friends, a girlfriend, a nice apartment, you get the picture. It sounds so silly to type, but it feels like this addiction that I have is fucking up my ability to enjoy any of it. It's like my whole life is just on autopilot and I'm in the backseat watching it all go by. And I hate it. 

When I really think about it, I just don't want to be this person anymore and I can't get over over the person I should be by now. I went to college for free because I received a scholarship for creative writing. I was getting paid writing gigs (fiction) by the time I was 18. I was building something for myself and was on the cusp of ""making it."" The I discovered weed and it ruined my life.

At first it made me relaxed. Food tasted good. And I fucking loved swimming on it so it encouraged me to exercise. Now? I couldn't even tell you if there's anything I do like about it. More and more anything positive it gave me, it took away and replaced it with paranoia and laziness. Of course, I know it's my fault. It's ME being lazy, but where would I be without it? 

I want my life back. I want to watch a movie sober. I want to have a conversation with my girlfriend without getting anxious about whether or not she knows I'm high. I'm tired of pretending it's not an addiction because it's not as bad as alcohol. I'm tired of being this version of me and I'm ready to leave it behind me. 

I'm ready to ask for help. 

I've visited this sub so many times but it always scared me because of how much I related to the posts. This addiction is my greatest shame for so many reasons and I just want to put it behind me.

I’m not like most people I know. Weed makes me EXTREMELY paranoid, uneasy, twitchy, and scared. It’s weird, all the things you’d think you’d want to avoid is what weed forces me to experience. It’s almost like the only time I feel alive is when I’m close to death, and weed is the portal that lets me toe the line. 

I can’t think of any pros from smoking that I experience. 

I don’t feel relaxed - I’m too paranoid to sit still

I can’t “turn my mind off” - in fact, it’s the opposite. I can’t help but think about every cringe moment in my life or over-think things that aren’t important. 

I don’t really think food tastes better when I’m high - in fact I think all the smoking has fucked up my smell, which I know is closely linked to taste. 

I don’t talk or become “fun” - in fact I become very isolated, closed-off and unable to hold conversations. I can’t even count how many relationships I’ve destroyed because of how distant I became. 


But yet - here I am. Still smoking around the clock, still stuck in this cycle with a drug that apparently isn’t addicting.  I wonder if it’s life that I’m afraid of. Mary Jane has volunteered to take the blame when I fail, so maybe I keep her around to take the weight off myself. I think I’m afraid that if I return to a sober life, that I might not like it. The 9-5 grind, the materialism, consumerism bullshit feels so much more tolerable when you’re numb from toking. 

I’ve tried and I’ve failed - and I think I need to refine my approach and come to terms with some painful realities. The only thing stopping me from quitting is the fear of facing reality.

Like “I know the past 300 times you’ve said it’s the last time were wrong but *this time* is the one” and then the next day I’m driving to the dispensary, berating myself for doing this again the whole way there. Each time I wanted “one final time” that would be a memorable high to book end my time smoking, or some kind of life changing event that would make me look at the joint in my hand and throw it down in disgust, but it never happens. The highs never fill the hole, nothing ever changes my view, and I’m stuck here waiting for something that will never come, probably because it doesn’t exist.

I just feel like I’m on the edge of a cliff, ready to bungie jump or base jump, and I just can’t make myself take the leap. I feel like I’m frozen in fear and I’m waiting for someone or something to give me that final push, even though I know I’m the only one who can do it. The internal logic of course being “if I smoke I have an excuse to not  try” which my brain sees as the safest possible option so naturally it’s pushing me there out of fear. 

Literally, there are no reasons for me to smoke even a hit, and yet with my bank account in the negative, I’m still debating buying two more joints, knowing full well it’ll once again make me stay up late playing games, which makes me sleep in, which makes me start work late, which makes me end work late, which makes me feel like I have no time to do anything after work, which makes me buy weed. I’m in an endless loop of my own creation and, even though I’m aware I’m the only one getting me out of here, I’m still waiting for someone else to come save me. Wtf is wrong with me that I just can’t get over this? Wtf am I waiting for? How do I make myself want to quit? How do I accept the answer of “you just have to quit”? Why am I so desperately searching for a way to quit smoking and stay smoking at the same time?

It's golden hour, the sun is shining. The wind is blowing gently. The air is crisp and refreshing, you can feel winter on the way as it's nipping at your face in the afternoon breeze. The days get shorter, the weather just a little colder. The trees rustle as their leaves brush together. Day after day, the leaves slowly begin to fall. As if they were growing, learning through the spring. Ripening and maturing throughout the summer and into the fall. Leaving their branch, their tree, floating effortlessly to the ground. There they lay facing the sun. That is us, we're the leaves. 

It's only day 8 for me, and this certainty isn't my first attempt at quitting. Will it be my last? I think so. I feel that it's within my power. Things are beginning to feel simpler. Life more precious, maybe. I'm not sure why I gave so much of myself to Mary Jane. Maybe it was how I was introduced, almost like meeting a new friend. She was already a part of my friend group anyway. Even the new friend groups I would find myself in, she was always there. Quiet, and humble. She was modest and kind on the surface, always making me laugh. 

At some point, she changed. She began to bring anxiety into my life. She pushed me away from my friends and family. I felt lonely, and I just brought her closer. We weren't always seeing each other everyday, until one day we were. I always knew that I'd have to break up with her. She was childish and immature. She could never be a real part of my adult life. I always knew I would let her go, but I never knew when. 10 years later and I'm beginning to figure it out. 

Isn't it interesting the relationship we develop with a pretty plant? It smells nice, seems harmless. It must be okay I mean people have been growing it, harvesting it, processing and smoking it for thousands of years...

Tonight I went for a long walk down by the lake. Half frozen, a gentle breeze in the air. Spring is quick on the horizon. It was golden hour and the sun was shining so beautifully. It's rays caressing the lake and her subtle waves. I walked along the bike path, following it through the woods by the side of the lake. I walked down to the sand, and followed it alongside the shore for a while. All I could think of was how nice it felt. Serene. I thought about how I would have loved to smoke, at least in a previous life. I remembered what it would feel like after I'd get high. All of sudden the wind would have felt cold. I would have realized I hadn't eaten in a few hours. I would have worried I was all of a sudden too hungry, would I pass out? My vision would begin to tunnel, and all serenity would have vanished as it would have quickly been replaced by anxiety. 

As I finished the walk I began to climb up the rocks from the shore back to the bike path. I noticed how nice they were, almost like a white marble. I wondered how long they had been there for. As I was looking at them, just taking everything in I noticed that smaller pieces of this marble-like rock had broken off and fallen to the shore. I picked one up, smooth on a few sides and rough on the other. I flipped it between my fingers and realized that this isn't something I've stopped to enjoy since I was a kid. The simplicity of a nice looking rock. I took that rock home with me and I thought about writing this post. It's my sobriety rock now. One that will remind me of the choices that I make. They will never be perfect, some rough, some smoother. However one thing is clear, they're mine to make just as this rock was mine to take.

Option one is to stay asleep and on autopilot while everything around me crumbles. Letting the ship crash while I at least feel fine.

Option two is to wake up into the reality, accept that there are no good options today, to take a hold of the steering wheel and take all of the crippling responsibilities by the head and try. 

I might not make it, I might end up in the same place as option one, but I decided to wake up. At least theres a chance and at least I can try to make decisions that won’t make me feel ashamed anymore.

*But it doesn't cure.*

When I get high, I'm not smoothing out the rough edges of what makes me 'me'. I'm covering them up. Masking what makes me an individual.

I smoked for 9 years. When I stopped, I became extremely uncomfortable with myself. I thought ""Damn i'm a piece of shit! Weed definitely made me a better person.""

But that was only because I hadn't known *who I was as a sober person*. I had not put in the work, the hard work, of growing from difficult situations and experiences unaltered.

9 years. I hadn't been in touch with myself for 9 years. Who was that person? What was their personality? What made them happy? What made them upset? I didn't have answers to those questions. Because I had warped my own perception of myself with weed.

We all know what its like to feel upset, stressed, or sad. But when was the last time I FELT those emotions in the most raw, dynamic way possible? Feeling those emotions, and working through the thoughts that come with those emotions... as a completely sober individual?

Guys, recovery is hard, but not particularly because of the cravings... It's hard because your coping mechanism for the past x years has been to escape my natural emotional growth process.

If you're in the beginning of recovery, you might have thought the same thing I did. It is so important to me to remember that the real, true 'me' needs to come out and experience life now. As dusty, broken, and alone that person is, i'm going to have to put in the work to dust them off, put on some bandaids, and spend time with sober me.

I deserve it. Its time to navigate through the fog... and place a new anchor. When life gets hard, when things become so unbearable that all I want to do is smoke... feel thankful that I am able to feel those emotions in the first place as a sober person. There is power in sobriety. Offering a helping hand to myself, and say ""Its time to rawdog life"".",185,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5115163}"

Context: 24 year old gay dude, been smoking a gram or so a night since I was \~20. I've spent most of COVID living alone and my use skyrocketed, as it's hard for me to spend time by myself without the negative self-talk. I really want to quit and have wanted to for years and now I feel really mobilized to do it.

Updates from day 3/4:

* woke up day 3 horribly depressed
* went to therapy and really ruminated the whole time. been hard to convey the complex emotions i'm feeling during this detox
* felt relaxed by end of day 3, even tried to go to sleep early to ensure a full night's rest, but spent 10:30pm-4am trying to fall asleep, masturbating twice, taking a non-prescription sleep supplement- nothing helped me. Spiraling spiraling, canceling my plans in the morning, turning off all alarms
* woke up this morning feeling a little less depressed but way more anxious, and needed to call out of work for a ""wellness day"" (a perk we've received during COVID). I'm actually in the last week of my job and I feel weird taking a day off when I'm supposed to be phasing out
* feel such strong feelings that i want to convey to others, almost to receive permission to feel these feelings, but my therapist (with permission, we've worked together a long time and I feel very supported so he can say things like this haha) told me i was a ""help rejecting complainer,"" and that's so spot on. I really want people to KNOW how depressed and anxious and lonely i feel but even when i tell them, and they say supportive things back, it's not enough. I'm not sure what will be enough.......
* self-care just isn't doing much for me right now. the things that usually make me feel happy/relaxed aren't helping as much. i LOVE meditation and have been meditating semi-regularly for years, but now i can't even sit for 2 minutes without spiraling.
* i volunteer every tuesday night and it's usually very de-centering to me, which is useful when you're an anxious mess, but today it's just too much. i don't want to see anyone or interact with anyone, all i naturally want to do is sit and suffer lol

Weirdly, I find the detox process super depressing and anxiety-inducing but also sort of beautiful because it really confirms what sort of reliance i've been putting on myself and cannabis.

Though I've been a lurker here for about a year before I quit for the 100th time, I haven't been here for around a year for various reasons. Today I looked at my life and thought it'd be helpful to someone who's at the beginning of their journey. Here's a list of what you can expect.

**1 - Things are bad and that feels bad**

At least for me, weed didn't really make things better but it certainly made me feel better about how bad things were. If I'm not paid well or can't find better gigs, weed would help me not feel the pain in that. This is not the same as dealing with it.

Imagine if you have garbage stacked in front of your house. Dealing with it is getting rid of the garbage but being high is like pouring a jar of essential oils on the garbage so it doesn't feel like an immediate problem.

So when you quit, things are going to stay bad until you deal with them. The only difference will be that it'll start to hurt. You'll be alone with the thought of your past failures, traumas, and short-comings with nothing to ease those thoughts. It's going to eat at you but it'll also make it easier to really deal with them because you'll get to understand how urgent these issues are and how heavy it is to carry them around with you all the time.

My biggest issue in the first 6 months was dealing with the fact that I've traded a life of muted positive emotions with a life of positive and negative emotions

**2 - Often its the weed, but sometimes it's you**

After the struggle of the first few months subside, you'll come to realize that you're still *you* but you're sober now. It sounds like truism but I was surprised. Getting high is one of your many habits and its the kind of habit that makes it easy to develop more detrimental habits.

I thought I wasn't cooking enough cause I was always high. Thought I didn't budget well because my addiction was this black hole of cash I couldn't keep under control. Thought I didn't call my grandparents enough cause I didn't want to sound high... but guess what? I still did those things after months of not smoking. These were habits of mine. Doesn't matter if I developed them because of being high or not. They were there now and I had to address them one by one.

**3 - For every friend who smokes, have one who doesn't**

I often see people talk about the fact that you have to part from your stoner friends. That's true for the first few months and it's true for those friends who are consistently high or those who have a personality fully shaped by their habit. But it doesn't have to be that way with all of your friends. If you're accountable to at least one person, your smoker friends will have very little influence.

Take my roommates for instance: 3 of them smoke every night and one of them is a recovering multi-addict who has been sober for 7 months or so. Even after more than a year, sometimes I smell the weed and wonder what it'd be like. But then I notice that my sober friend is chilling and it genuinely calms me. We're a team. I may mention that I'm craving and he'd just flippantly say ""no you aren't"" and it really brings me back down. He's right... it's not me who's craving - it's just some past memory of who I was and that's not who I am anymore.

Keep people who you feel accountable to. They may be smokers but they respect you enough to keep you accountable and want to help you do what you all know is good for you. If you do this, then stoners will have very little power over you.

**4 - Tell everyone**

This is kind of like the last one since it stems from accountability. The one effective way that stopped my craving was creating an accountability prison out of all of my relationships. I basically told everyone I knew the worst version of how I felt during my addiction. I don't know if I hyperbolized or if it was the commitment to radical honesty that made me talk about how I really felt.

Anyways, I told my parents and all my friends for the first time. This made it incredibly embarrassing to relapse. Shame is a powerful force and if you really want to quit for good, you can weaponize it. Quitting alone always failed but knowing how people were proud of me, it made me want to go. Now I get random messages asking how many days its been and it's a big driving force not to reset that big number.",41,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50614905}"

I feel better than I have in a long time, but not without challenges. Quitting weed isn’t a magical fix, and it’s actually more difficult at the beginning because you’re forced to face that which you were suppressing by smoking. However, keep the faith because it does indeed get better, and your life will be vastly improved. Things I’ve noticed: 
1) time - I have so much more time to work on things that are important to me. This includes studying for the LSAT (law school admissions test) which I had been putting off. It also allows me time to read and journal rather than watching tv or playing video games - not that I don’t still enjoy tv and video games, there’s just time to do both. 
2) energy - whether just throughout the day or when exercising I’ve noticed a huge improvement. 
3) breath - breathing feels so much easier and I’m able to run without getting out of breath nearly as quickly as I had. 
4) shame - no more shame associated with smoking or being high around people. 
5) sleep - though it is hard to get through the first few weeks I now have so much better quality sleep, and I have very intense dreams. I had lost my ability to dream while smoking. 
6) memory - can actually remember things I’ve read and heard whereas while smoking it felt like I would forget something as soon as I’d read it. 
7) MONEY - money to save and or spend on things that actually add value to my life, like my fish tank or clothes and shoes. Things that are tangible and don’t burn immediately after purchase. 
8) confidence - even though there are still bad days, it feels so much better to face them head on and not immediately suppress the bad day by smoking. Working through bad days allows us to learn and improve rather than just hiding from it or acting like it didn’t happen. 
9) responsibility to commitments - I got a dog which has been awesome and honestly if you can afford it I would recommend because it gives you a reason not to smoke (to be the best owner possible). I’ve also started volunteering for two local organizations and have followed thru on my commitment to them. Whereas when I was smoking, I might have chosen to stay up late into the night, and thus miss an early appointment. 
10) Less moody - nice knowing that I don’t need anything (other than coffee and food, lol) to be content. 
These are just some of the benefits I’ve noticed. It’s super hard and not all linear, some days you will feel like shit, but push through them and you will be so much happier with yourself and your life for it. You got this.",35,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.79328495}"

Now, from those of you who followed my story for a bit, I started suffering horrible anxiety and disassociation after smoking back in September. It was awful. I felt like I was living in a dream 24/7. I still have days where I do, it's not gone yet. 

I needed a way to cope with the anxiety because it was killing me. My blood pressure was high, I could t sleep, I lost over 30 lbs from not eating. I scheduled in a session for neurofeedback therapy, had a brain scan and they found I actually had some issues from the concussion I had back in July before I quit smoking. 

So I've been doing therapy for that, the concussion is cleared up and now I'm working on some childhood trauma stuff that's keeping me disassociated.

Fast forward to now. My life is consumed by it. I need it to wake up right. I need it to sleep right. I need it to work. I pretty much just needed it to function. 

So after 6 years of heavy use I decided 6 days ago I’m done. No more will it control me. No more will it continue to make my bad anxiety worse. No more feeling hungry for the next hook up.  No more getting mad when I don’t have it.

Been smoking 1-2 grams a day since my early 20s, I suspect to help me deal with my depression/anxiety/ADHD issues.  


About 4 years ago I managed to quit for about 6 months, and it was the happiest I've ever been. Every aspect of my life improved. I was much more social, rarely depressed, more focused, actually had the motivation to go out and find a girlfriend (which I did, we're still together). Everyone said they noticed a positive change in me, it all felt so good.  


But then complacency kicked in. Started using recreationally again, which lead to me falling into the same old habits. Then I got a job working nights, and so getting high at work was easy because nobody was really around to notice. It turned me into a zombie. I neglected my friendships because of the combination of working nights and getting high all the time. I lost the motivation to find a computer programming job (which is what I went to college for). I let my mental health deteriorate once again.  


Last week my anxiety became so bad that I couldn't go into work. My body was screaming at me that something has to give, a lifestyle change needs to me made.  


So I went on paid sick leave (probably not going to go back), quit smoking weed 24 hours ago, and started on some anti-depressant/ anxiety medication today. I feel so rough right now. The withdrawals are making me so uncomfortable, and the initial effects of the medication will probably make it worse for the next little while. I just hope I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and recapture that feeling I had when I quit weed 4 years ago.  


I love weed, but it was just making all my problems worse, and killing any motivation to fix them.

Long time lurker here on /leaves, but first time poster.   Wanted to share my story in case it could help someone else.  Ran across this sub by accident a few months back.  I had been feeling guilty about my smoking habits, so I joined.  Whenever I would see a post from r/leaves in my feed, I would quickly scroll by without reading it because I knew I wasn't ready to quit yet.  Never been an all day smoker,  but a 15 year nightly smoker.  I never drink alcohol,  but I compare myself to a ""functioning alcoholic.""  Always keep it under enough control that I make it to work every day, but no way I'm able to give 100%.

 I live in a state with legal recreational Marijuana,  and I'm fortunate to have a good income.  So availability has not been an issue.  Since being made legal, the THC content has skyrocketed. Local shops sell ""infused"" joints made with oil with 50% + THC content.  An occasional infused joint becomes a 3 joint nightly habit.  Through the pandemic, I've worked less hours so I could get home earlier.  My nightly habit became an afternoon habit.  As the THC content went up, my enjoyment went down.  Smoking more and stronger stuff chasing the same high.  I was at a crossroads in my life, and decided to quit.  The 3 days before quitting, I read the sub every day.  Hearing this many people go through the same struggles I've faced have been so encouraging to me.  I would go as far as to say without this sub, I wouldn't be sober today. 

So now I'm on day 13.  The first 5 days were the hardest, as I tried to fill the smoking time with something else.  While I'm 37 years old, I have virtually no hobbies because all of my free time was spent getting high.  So I bought myself a badass RC car, with the thought of rewarding myself once I made it 5 days clean.  I stared at the car for 3 days before putting down the joints.  At day 5 sober, I had a marvelous time playing with my new toy.  Now, wherever I have a craving, I remember my new toy and the fun times I have to look forward to.  While I'm only on day 13, I'm confident that my life has already turned for the better.  I'm enjoying my new hobby, I'm actually playing with my kids,  and my relationship with my wife is great.  I didn't even tell her I was planning on quitting.  I waited until I reached the 5 day sober mark to mention it, so I wouldn't have her keeping me accountable if I failed.   She's been sober 6 years, her strength makes me feel weak.  

As stoners, we live in a lonely bubble.  Knowing so many others on r/leaves are facing or have conquered the same battle has been a source of strength for me.  I still read every day, even though the cravings have lessened,  as a reminder of the life I no longer want.  While it's not easy, you too can get out of the grasps of weed.  I read a comment earlier today that talked about what 6 months of compounded ""clear headed"" days could do.  While I'm not yet at 2 weeks, I already feel like I can conquer the world.  You can too.",18,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4609924}"

Results seem to vary but for me, quitting increased my sex drive quite a bit, which my wife appreciates. Anyway we got down to business yesterday evening after the kids were in bed, not sharing any TMI details but my actual point is that afterwards, we spent an hour just lounging in bed and talking about work, life, vacations we want to take coming up, laughing and musing with each other.

It's our 10 year anniversary this year and I'm so lucky to be married to my best friend, even the stress of the pandemic and working at home and raising two little kids hasn't broken us. At the same time, weed nearly did. It made me so emotionally distant in general, and especially in the evenings all I wanted to do was get high and be in my own little world. Even when I could muster the energy for sex back then, I would've been back downstairs, hitting the vape in the bathroom right afterward. Always feeling my mind called elsewhere instead of focused on her and us.

Just a couple months before I quit, we went out to dinner and she started crying, admitting to me that she felt this distance growing between us and like we were losing touch with each other as people and instead just partners in raising kids together. It was a real wake up call for me although even then I didn't actually quit, hell I was high at the restaurant where she told me. But I think it started my process of getting to the point where I could quit.

Just wanted to share something beautiful from the other side if it helps motivate anyone to take the plunge. Not everyone is as luck as me to have someone like this in your life and if that's you, my heart goes out to you. But I also read stories here sometimes of folks who lose the person they feel was the love of their life because of that emotional distance. That was almost me.

There have been weeks where I thought about getting high every day and weeks where I barely thought about it, I've been dreaming about smoking again and feeling really guilty in the dream. 

It's been 2 weeks that I've started feeling really blue, staring at the void, being apathic with friends, and sometimes (3 days the last 2 weeks) drinking 3/4 of a bottle of wine alone at 4-5pm. I hate having a hangover and I get those easily so it keeps from drinking more often, but it's clear it's been an unhealthy use. I began seeing a therapist and I see him every 6 weeks. I see him in 2 weeks but it feels it's in a really long time. I think I'm gonna ask him for the first time if taking meds is an option (I've never taken any meds) for my anxiety/depression.

My perspective on my experiences in life have taken on a different meaning now. I can remember the first time I got high... I was 13 on a beach and amazed at the effect the drug had on me. I remember being 14 or 15 and listening to music at my parents house in awe of the depth the music had from a tiny little single speaker radio (the song was Blue Rodeo - Head over heals). I remember at the age of 28 being drunk and stoned sitting in front of a wood pile admiring my work of previous wood splitting and feeling the most euphoric I ever had ever experienced. 

These are some positive memories I have and I can't or won't discount them or try to flip them over to be evaluated as a negative experience for the sake of my new outlook on life and specifically the impact weed had on it. I guess I'm at a point where I'm integrating the effect weed had on my life as I move on and become a different person. It really took changing my entire being to finally escape the entapment weed. 

There is so much more to life when the burden of dealing with addiction is out of the way.

The others I noticed outside of smoking we had nothing in common. Kept maybe one or two good friends who respected my boundaries. (One going as far as joining me in sobriety).

 I got alot of flack from my friends who said ""everyone says they are going to quit and come back to it"". I got laughed at. I collected myself and blocked them all on social media and told them to fuck off. Look, it might take one ,two, five, or ten times to get it right, heck I can't even guarantee that'll I'll be sober forever because I don't know what the future has in store. What I do know is even if you or I fail ,as long as I keep striving to change I think that's progress in of itself.

It may not seem possible right now, but the life you've dreamed of is within your reach. Not just quitting smoking, but actually feeling happy, having boundaries and relationships. Accepting you have a problem is the hardest step, it will only get easier from here on out.

I reached 100 days. Wow! With hard work and determination I did it! My life has skyrocketed since giving up weed. I started to love myself, I got accepted into a IT school, my connection with my family is better, my mood is more stable, I save more money, my sleep cycle is normal and I dream often, etc. Instead of running away from issues, I face them head on. 

Mind you I work at a Cannabis club so I'm around it all the time, I get discounts, and  free stuff all the time. I give it all away to my cousins. If I can hit 100 days, so can you. It took me many attempts to get to this point,  but everytime I fell, I  got back up.  I'm on the path to self mastery and there's no turning back. I quit heavy drugs, dont eat junk food, vegan diet, quit watching porn/masturbation, read books I'm interested in. Ride my bicycle everyday. Started gaining hobbies. Discipline is a great motivator for me. I went through a lot of bad days and was lost before I got to this point. I had to. 

I still get stressed out. In fact I'm very stressed from school, I still get bored, depressed, anxious but now I get to deal with it instead of smoking it away. I have straight As in my classes for the first time. It's a lot of work and it keeps me stressed but it's what needs to be done. I dropped down to part time at my job at the cannabis club for school and even though I work at a cannabis club I dont even think about weed. It's weird. Its amazing!

Many doors open for you when you're willing to put in effort to improve your life. I came a long ways and have a long ways to go but I never felt better in my life. I'm finally freeing myself. Open to questions, always like to help others.

I started smoking weed 4 years ago during junior year of high school when I was 16 years old. The memory of the first time I got high (where, how, with who, etc.)  is still crystal clear in my mind. It's crazy in this aspect...almost like losing your virginity. 

As an Asian who moved to the states at a young age, I clashed with my parents quite a bit during my teenage years. The pressure to excel in school, sports, and extracurriculars. The cultural barrier. The expectation to be the perfect eldest son. The list is endless...It got to a point where I felt so overburdened and restricted that I wanted to do something to free myself. Something that my parents would disapprove of. And that was to smoke weed. 

The first time I smoked weed was with my friend's bong. Pretty crazy introduction to the drug (yes, I believe weed is a drug...anything that alters your mind, even music, is a drug). To make matters worse, I attended a large public school in Southern California, where a good chunk of everyone around me smoked and countless dispensaries were nearby. 

I have an addictive personality, so I got hooked fast. It started with hitting the pen a few times before bed. Then it was j's in the school parking lot in the mornings. Then it was bong rips after sports practice. Then it was edibles every weekend... Thanks to the tutoring and advising that my parents put me through, I still managed to graduate at the top of my high school class and started attending a top 20 university. The freedom was unparalleled. And as expected, my weed usage exponentially went up, especially as I surrounded myself with people with similar habits. ""Smart Stoners"" I liked to label us in my head. After all, we had all gotten here right? Eventually, though, it got to the point where it felt like I was high more often than sober. The days were a blur. My sleep felt off. My apetite was wild one day and gone the next. Constant anxiety. My concentration and focus were rock bottom. All in all, weed defined me during the first 2 years of college, and college binge drinking only made this worse.

Fast forward to December of 2020, around 3 months ago when I was back home in California. My parents, brother, and I all got nasty cases of covid. For me, I had never been that sick in my entire life to date, from breathing problems to body aches to the chills. During this time, for the first time in a while, I did not have the physical nor mental temptation to get high. And it was also at this point that I realized how fuc\*ed up my body was, that I needed to take care of myself. I realized every hit I took, every edible I ate, it was only poisoning my cells with something artificial. Anyway, I vowed that I would never go back...

It is now March of 2021. I have not touched weed (or nicotine - that's another story haha) for 3 months. My 2021 is pure. Untarnished. For those of you trying to quit, just know this. The first 6-8 weeks are pure hell. You'll have insomnia. Night sweats. Cravings. Emotional imbalance. But after this, it turns around for the better. Yes, the anxiety is still here. Yes, the brain fog is still here. And yes, the memory and concentration problems are still here. But I slowly feel myself returning. I feel stronger and healthier every single day where I am not enslaved to weed. I've been more social. More active. And I've invested into the relationships with people I care about.

I have posted on this sub multiple times after making a strong attempt to kick weed. However, I have bad news and I really need to go cold turkey.

I was smoking heavy but cut back in an attempt to exert self control since 2021 started (of course, this was after proclaiming my resolution of kicking weed indefinitely). 

This led me to purchasing a pre-roll or two for the weekend, allowing me to avoid smoking during the week. Well, that backfired. I spend my entire weekend stoned and I eat anything in my path. Then, at the end of each day, I make myself vomit to purge all that food sitting in my stomach. I follow that up by smoking more to calm my stomach down. Finally, I find myself trying to battle ANOTHER wave of munchies. 

This is terrible, and I legitimately think I am setting up myself for an eating disorder. It gets to a point where I justify my munchies by telling myself I can just vomit it up later.

I would read through posts all the time while smoking the last few months, all the while hating what I was doing and yet still doing it. Now I read posts for motivation and as a reminder of the decision I made and it’s worth. In a way I’m making this post to commit myself to quitting and moving on. 

The first couple weeks were weird for me. I definitely had the usual physical cravings pretty hard, but there was an odd sort of euphoria initially because constant sobriety was different. Since then, it has not been easy. The physical withdrawals have subsided (crazy dreams aside), but I now experience a lack of motivation for hobbies I normally enjoy and find it really hard to deal with. I mean this in the most sincere way, but it’s comforting to hear that people experience these things at this stage too. I really do believe there is light at the end of the tunnel, but I have yet to feel it’s warmth.

I’m struggling to see how things will get better, but I know there is more to this process. One immediately good thing is I can feel the clarity in my thoughts and when I speak to people, especially my SO. I abused smoking for years, but recently traveling back home from uni made it easier to quit. Using the word quit still feels weird, although I know it shouldn’t. Apologies if this post comes off as kind of negative. My fear is for someone who is reading this to be put off quitting, I still feel it’s so so worth it if smoking is affecting you or has become your everything.

I stumbled on r/leaves a few months ago while googling about marijuana addiction. For a long time I was convinced, like a lot of other people (it seems), that marijuana addiction was a myth - it was all in my brain and I was just weak-minded because I couldn’t shake it. 

I’m 33 and I have used marijuana almost daily since as long as I can remember, at least since HS.  Weed helped me calm down and relax, it still does. I have comfort in thinking of it as “my glass of wine at the end of the day”, my innocent vice, if you will LOL. But I think it’s starting to take its toll in a few different aspects of my life. 

In recent years I’ve almost accepted it, “it’s just a part of me and I should learn to be happy with myself - the world is becoming more accepting (legalization) and once that happens uniformly I’ll be ok”. 

But lately I just don’t think I can have it in my life anymore - I don’t have any goals except to maintain my standard of living by working at jobs I hate, and to afford my habit.  I don’t have many relationships with people on a deep level, just many acquaintances - because I’m embarrassed of my habit.  I struggle financially, to support my habit.

I have taken breaks before but never quit cold turkey, so here I go.

As a European I have pretty much only been smoking spliffs (weed mixed with tobacco) which will probably make it harder considering the nicotine element.

This post I am making as a reminder why I want to quit:

1. I am almost 20 and feel like I am **wasting my potential** smoking weed; I am fine with doing nothing or just stuff that doesn't bring me anywhere (e.g. watching YT videos high). I read, create, study and workout less to none on weed.
2. **Health**. This one is self-explanatory. 10 to 15 percent of smokers develop lung cancer. And smokers die 10-15 years earlier on average compared to non-smokers. Although I still don't feel like I realise this fact, it is perhaps the most important one.
3. **Munchies are the worst.** Whenever I get high I pretty automatically indulge in watching series/anime/videos while stuffing myself full with so much food. I can eat a whole pizza for dinner, smoke afterwards and eatimmediately eat a shit ton after. 
4. **Clear head space will benefit me** so much. I am a student at a university and I like to write screenplays.  I am doing okay at both but it can be so much better if I just clear my head. Moreover, I sometimes tend to overthink stuff or be anxious about the most pointless stuff ever. Stopping weed will only help that. Lastly, I like to play chess and I can only imagine it will help me.
5. I think my **sexual performance will improve**. 
6. My **teeth will become yellow** if I smoke. So don't do it.
7. It will save me so much **money**. At least 50% of my money goes to weed. My guess is that I spent around 150-200 euros a month on weed. I can buy so much cool stuff with that money instead of some grass to burn.

Been smoking a gram or two of weed every night for a few years, taking breaks here and there. On Friday, I felt super anxious and lonely and was spiraling until I got stoned and felt super euphoric. Slept awful that night and woke up on Saturday telling myself- this is it. I can't do this anymore!

For the entire pandemic, I have prioritized having my own space to myself to get high, listen to music, and mindlessly scroll until I fall asleep. I leave things early to give myself this space, and have dramatically pulled away from my friends. It's avoidant attachment to its core; I feel so lonely even though I have so many friends. My friends reach out and I push them away. I feel no sense of community yet can't muster the energy to reach out and connect with people. This pandemic has just been so awful on my mental health.

And I've been coping with my anxiety for years with cannabis, so I think having nothing but time to myself, living alone (I actually spent a few months living in a group house thinking it'd make me feel less lonely but then I had a conflict that became too much and left back to my old apartment), has led me to depend on cannabis. But even when I smoke I feel euphoric for <1 hour and then the overthinking and anxiety comes back. I don't sleep well and wake up feeling groggy. I feel unmotivated and alone.

So when I woke up on Saturday morning, I decided I wanted to stop. I packed up all my products and gave them to a friend. Cleaned everything. Came home and found a few joints in the ashtray and I flushed them down the toilet. 

I have hobbies, but they don't consume or overtake me anymore. All I want to do is lie in my bed and sulk about the state of the world, yelling at myself about how alone and lonely I am. I can't spend time with myself without thinking I'm some loser or thinking I'm being unproductive. But even when I spend time with friends recently I feel so disconnected from people.

Now it's Monday and I haven't smoked since Friday night. Last night I had horrible headaches and my anxiety was through the roof. I woke up this morning feeling super super depressed. Therapy isn't helping, self-care isn't helping, reaching out to friends for support isn't helping; I just don't know what to do. 

BUT I don't think weed is serving me so I still think I need to take a step back from it. There's nothing to gain from it except in pretending that these emotions aren't there. It suppresses me and gives me a facade that everything in my life is going great and I'm happy, even if those feelings are fleeting and leave me ultimately worse off than before.",6,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8709225}"

For years I viewed pot as my treat and my consolation for not binge eating, which used to be a problem for me. I loved to smoke up and exercise; for a while I couldn't go for a run or go to a fitness class without getting stoned.

Now that I'm not smoking and am going through all these life challenges, I'm indulging in treats a whole lot more, because I ""deserve"" it.

But I am starting the think that what used to be a tool to allow me to think out side of the box or the added 'spice' that makes life more bearable is just a crutch. I went from smoking/vaping as a fun time activity with as little as 1 - 3.5g lasting me for almost 2 weeks to now purchasing an oz for the same time frame.

I have no clue how I’ve spent all that time thinking it honestly helped me when all I’d do is smoke to forget how I am treated.   We had to put down my almost sixteen year old dog two weeks ago and it was fucking horrible but a reality check that I’m just pissing my time away trying to get out of my head and that I don’t feel good about how I’m living.

I’ve hallucinated from smoking clean weed multiple times, once very badly. Posters were flowing images of other things, I could hear a phone ringing in different spots of the room I was in, and I heard something crawling on the floor and starting to come up onto the bed. It only got better when I woke up my ex crying and shaking and whispering because I didn’t want anything to hear me and I hid my head while he held me. Another time I smoked and saw my dad in place of my partner, and he said hi to me before I blacked out and hit my head. When I woke up a minute or less later my nose was bleeding.

I don’t know what I’m doing with myself and it’s really scary. I’m used to smoking from the time I wake up til I go to sleep, and I used to vape all day too. I’ve almost completely quit vaping, and I’ve hardly smoked since making my decision (my intention is quitting completely). I am sober today. I’m doing a decent job I think, it’s tougher when my parents go smoke because I feel compelled to join them, but I know that the only “benefit” I get from it is fast forwarding through my day. 

So far I’ve gotten more cleaning done than I have in weeks, and I feel extremely restless and upset but I’m dealing with it, because I know when I’m stoned I feel the same way just less aware and more out of my body. I want to be someone the kid me would be proud of, and I grew up thinking one of the worst things is someone who can’t handle being alone with themself and their mind. The world’s scary and I don’t like what’s happened but I need to make the best out of life while I have it.

More like weed-mares, actually, i wake up convinced i smoked and it takes about 5 minutes of pure panic before i realise it was just a dream.  I start thinking im headed back down that road or ill never quit and its insane how convincing they are to a point that i wake up and freak for a minute.  

I have been exercising more intense lately to try and detox my system since THC is fat soluble and wonder if that is triggering things?  The other morning, after a double workout the day before, I woke up from one of these dreams feeling high.  I shook me all morning and took me getting out and going for a walk to clear my head.

The shame compounding shame. The turning away the framed photo of my late dad when I sparked up. The weirdly robotic experience of using while knowing it was making things worse.

After 9 years of constant use, I determined it to be the cause of a majority of my mental illnesses.","I would find any excuse to not be sober. I was escaping reality, avoiding socialization, avoiding responsibilities, just to feel something other than sober.

I stopped when I used one day and fell into a paranoid anxious loophole of self awareness. I was miserable. Not only that, I was furious that this plant had its grip around my balls and was controlling my life. 

I had my friend take everything even remotely related to that way of life. I told him I never wanted to see it again.

2 months of withdrawals, but I turned the corner. I was able to feel comfortable being sober for the first time in 9 years. It was an alien feeling, but I was ready to figure out who I really was without the substance. The range of emotions i'm able to feel is remarkable. My feelings now are genuine.

I havent had an anxiety attack, psychotic episode, or suicidal ideation since I quit. I am now in control of my own story, my own emotions. I am no longer wearing a leash, being tugged down the hole of paranoia and anxiety. My depression lightened to a much easier level. I am now able to articulate myself, rather than fight through the fog and try and piece words together to describe how I really feel. My thinking has become much more linear.

I have a personality now that is based on who I truly am, not in an altered state. I feel so much smarter and more responsible now. I have natural motivation to accomplish goals.

Tonight makes it 3 weeks weed free for me, and I’m so happy about this choice. She immediately started telling me how there’s no way she would stop, it helps her so much, etc etc. It wasn’t about her though, it was about me. Then she kept telling me she would give me her dealers number, that I should try weed derived substances instead, she just wasn’t getting it. Not everyone will, and that’s ok. It was weird though. 

Some other guy that I don’t know (from Snapchat) I told I quit, and it was the same thing, he proceeded to tell me how he just HAS to smoke everyday, and how he could never quit. I find it funny that people immediately start to talk about themselves and their own weed smoking, when I’m only telling them about my experience, and I don’t even ask them or try or get them to stop or anything. I do have some other friends that have congratulated me, and then we just leave it at that. 

But it’s like the others, they are so offended when I tell them I’ve quit; and they get so defensive about their own habit, when I haven’t even said anything about their weed smoking habits, or even saying anything bad about weed, I just say it’s not for me now. It’s not for me anymore. That’s cool, no big deal. Yeah, it’s obviously a big deal for us, but we come here for that. I just had to tell her because I can’t have her expecting when I see her again that we will be smoking. 

Does anyone have any insight on how to deal, or what to say to people like this, when they react in this way? I see so much how they use all these excuses for why they think they need it, I used the same bs excuses. I had another friend who was curious, and he was like, maybe I’ll quit too, so it’s nice to know I’ve inspired someone to at least start to think about quitting too. I just am not really sure how to handle going forward in the future as she obviously wasn’t respecting what I was telling her, as she kept sort of trying to undermine my progress by trying to hook me up with her dealer. LOL I don’t have a problem finding weed, lol that’s not the issue. 


Anyway I know this journey isn’t for all, but it’s for me, and I’m loving it so far. As someone who’s smoked for 22 years everyday, I’m over it. Being high got boring, it turned into automatic autopilot. Now I have so much more to look forward to, that’s not just smoking a blunt and zoning out everyday, every night. 

Thanks for listening, this has been half vent/half advice for how to deal socially with people who are going to act this way, in a way that is diplomatic. I have a hard time with social cues sometimes, but I’m not trying to dis anyone, by saying that I’ve quit. I do wish everyone reacted positively but it’s just not that way.

2021-03-07 11:11:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lztotx/today_i_hit_my_2year_anniversary/,Today I hit my 2-year anniversary,"Hi leaves,

I hope you all are doing well on your path to recovery. It was exactly two years ago that I decided I had enough and quit all forms of cannabis consumption. Up to that point I tried moderation, I tired tolerance-breaks, but no matter how far I got I always seem to fall back in bad habits. 

I was consumed by the thought of smoking. When I woke up, it was the first joint of the day that got me out of bed. I planned my meals around smoking, because I knew that I wouldn’t have any appetite if I didn’t. I weighted what little weed I had left of the previous days, and worried constantly if I had enough to get me through the day. The social anxiety of being isolated for so long made the thought of meeting up with my dealer a truly dreadful one – but you know, it HAD to be done. 

Looking back, I can’t begin to imagine how I could let a substance control my life in that way. It had so much power over me, for so long, that it just began to be my new normal. Addiction is a terrible thing and being in denial is even worse. Just an endless amount of suffering that you inflict upon yourself, and slowly but surely making yourself your worst enemy.

The years of self-neglect and isolation brought on in huge parts by my addiction, finally cumulated in one of the worst experiences of my life. I was going to marketing school at the time, and knew I had finals the next day. For the life of me, I could not get myself to start studying. It all seemed so pointless. I was battling with the thought of suicide daily, and an exam just seemed to so minor and trivial in comparison. 

When I was cleaning up the dishes *(to just make myself feel somewhat productive)* it all hit me like a dump-truck. First my face felt numb, then the numbness spread out my arms. My heart began racing faster and faster, until I collapsed on the floor. In my head, I was convinced I was having a heart-attack and I was dying. The numbness was overwhelming every part of my body and mind. I thought “Well, now you don’t have to actually do it, your body is finally giving up” and it brought me some wicked sense of relief. The feelings in my body continued for what seemed to be forever, and I just laid on my floor quietly sobbing for the next couple of hours.

My parents lived an hour away, and they could sense I wasn’t feeling great. My father tried calling me multiple times, but my phone was muted and hidden away. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, and nobody was be allowed to see me this way. I felt an overwhelming sense of shame – how could I, a relatively smart young man allow myself to be in this position?

While laying on the floor sobbing, I heard a knock on the door. At first, I tried to ignore it but the knocking continued. When I finally unlocked and opened the door, I saw my father standing in the doorway. I will never in my life forget the look on his face. His face was filled with worry and sorrow, and he was completely beside himself. He asked me what was going on, and why I didn’t answer my phone. My gut reaction was to act indifferent and I just told him that I forgot to unmute the phone. It only took another serious look from him to make me completely break down right in front of him. I couldn’t fight this alone – not anymore.

We talked for hours that night about me and my life, my addiction, absolutely everything. When it was all said and done, I packed a bag and we drove back to my childhood-home. 

Shortly after I booked an appointment for a psychiatrist and began treatment. I was diagnosed with a minor depression and anxiety. I got on medications which truly helped in the beginning, but after a while they stopped working. Tried different medications, that had the same effect. I concluded that by the end of the day I didn’t like the way the medication made me feel to indifferent to everything and everyone and started looking for alternatives that would work for me.

I moved back in with my parents shortly after. I needed the daily structure I couldn’t provide for myself. It was a huge blow to my ego but looking back it was the best decision I could have made in the circumstances I was under.

I slowly began building up my life again. Started reaching out to old friends, began cycling every day. Slow and steady improvements just kept stacking up. During the first half year, I was still consumed by the thought of smoking on a daily basis. Then the thought began to fade. I began to have multiple days where I didn’t think about it. That became weeks, then months. By the end of my first year in sobriety it had completely lost the control it once had over me. 

So much have happened in the two years I was sober. I finished my finals with above average scores. Pure chance landed me a job teaching adults the Office-Suite, which laid the foundation of my career. I’m now teaching multiple classes in Marketing, IT and Sociology and I’m truly loving what I do *(well covid sucks, but you get catch the drift)*. I moved out after a year and got my own place again, which was a huge upgrade from my previous apartment. I started dating, and found the sweetest, most kindhearted girl I've ever met in my life. We've been together now for 3 months. I started investing. I started building a business with my father. I started my own mountain-biking-group and began to participate in a board-game-group with some of my best friends since high school. 

Life has improved so drastically in such a short time that it’s kind of unreal to think back at how it was. I’ve stayed on this subreddit for inspiration along the way, and I still love seeing the positive posts and comments and reading about how each one of you is fighting (and winning!) your own personal battles.

Here’s to another year filled with love, self-improvement and compassion for oneself and others. You are all truly making a difference in your own life and for others, and I’m proud to be alongside all of you.

I’ve lost myself. Smoking weed has changed who I am and how I view the world. I was introduced to it at a rocky point in my life, when I was going through a lot of changes. At the time, it was this fun new thing that made me feel ecstatic. It made me feel something that I hadn’t felt in a very long time. Everything was better. Food tasted better, the sun felt better on my skin, the air was fresher, sex was fucking amazing, everything I watched was hilarious...

Slowly, weed became my life. I didn’t want to do anything sober anymore. Why would I want to? I was having the time of my life, blissfully ignoring the things I had to do (esp. as a college student). And theeeeen, I flunked. I failed the semester and lost my sponsorship. Soon after that I got dumped. I fell. I fell into the deepest darkest place.

But I still had my weed :) yaaay!
I could just spark one and all my problems would disappear. All the dread, anger and pain, gone. At least I thought. I couldn’t get through the day without smoking. But after some time, the weed stopped working. Tolerance is a bitch. But I kept on smoking and smoking AND SMOKING. 

Where am I even going with this lmao. I guess this is a rant now

Anyway, that was a long while back and I’m still grappling with the effects that era had on me. I try to kick this habit, but I always find myself breathing out clouds of thc after a few days. Idk man, idk. I’m trying to get my life back together.

I have saved a boatload of money, can think way more clearly and have less brain fog and am able to face difficult issues in my life more easily. Smoking weed really fed into my procrastinating and breaking out of this cycle feels amazing. These are all good things and they make me quite proud of myself.

I had expected that nicotine withdrawal would be much worse than it actually turned out to be, so the psychical struggle has also been rather manageable. So far, so good

One of the fears I had associated with quitting was that certain activities in my life wouldn't nearly be as enjoyable without being stoned (playing videogames and listening to music being the main ones). What I didn't really account for was my the way I experienced having sex changing.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over twelve years and although our sex life might not be quite as exciting as it was the first few months and years, I still really enjoy our intimacy. We have been trying to get pregnant for the last year or so, which in our case generally means having sex every other day. This was far from a problem to me being high (every evening), in fact, I always really looked forward to it. 

After having quit, it's quite different. I feel so much present sober, that it can be weirdly off-putting? For starters, I don't nearly feel as horny or excited to have sex as often. It may sound contradictory, but I get distracted more easily and sort of.. take myself out of the moment?! 

As a guy, I have always (maybe foolishly) believed that 'lasting long' is incredibly important for sex and this has become MUCH harder for me being sober. This is really fucking with my confidence and even though I have talked about it with my girlfriend (she says she doesn't mind and is extremely cool and understanding about the whole thing) I can't seem to shake the uneasiness and it is really affecting my sex drive in general. If I can't 'perform' the way I am used to, I might as well not it at all. I know that sounds really stupid, but it's the way I feel. 

Has anyone else had similar problems? Is there a way to get out of my own head a bit more? Or not climax quite as fast without fogging my brain up with copious amounts of ganja? I am curious what your experiences are like!",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5517815}"

2021-03-05 03:07:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ly77lc/how_i_feel_after_5_weeks/,How I feel after 5 weeks,"Hi everyone. Just want to say I'm proud of all us for where we're at no matter if it's day 1 or 1000. Just wanted to share a little update based on how I'm feeling now that it's been over a month and I assume my body has excreted most if not all of the stored cannabinoids that I was consuming. 

A little background for context: I smoked the stuff since I was 15 every day, except for a few tolerance breaks that I can count on one hand. I'm now 22 years old and finally feel like this time is not just a tolerance break, I'm really done with the stuff. The first time I tried quitting and went more than a month was approximately 4 years ago and I spent a total of five months off. It wasn't easy at first, but I remember once it hit 3-4 weeks in I kept asking myself, why was this so hard each time I tried? I was the stoner who would tell myself all the time that I would quit, at least just for a small tolerance break but when it got to the night time, I always gave in with the excuse of having a better night's sleep. Part of why I got so into smoking when I was a freshman in high school was because I always had trouble getting to sleep. Would spend hours just tossing and turning and then have to wake up for class exhausted.

But, I've always had this consistent urge to be able to pick it up and put it down when I wanted, to have control. I always felt so guilty for having this addiction, but I would tell myself at least it's not harder drugs.

Anyway - let's get down to the effects.

* Day 1 took a while to get to. I would tell myself that I was done and ready to start, but then end up walking down to the dispensary and picking up a gram and saying ""this is the last gram"" which happened maybe 5-6 times. This was helpful in a way, because I was tapering down, trying to save the gram as long as I could.
* Day 2 finally came around after a night of not being able to get to sleep very well, but it did come. I drank sleepy time tea, with passionflower extract in it and that was really helpful. 
* [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lc0fdd/7_days_in/) days in I finally started to feel like I had it under control and I was not going to look back. 
* 2 weeks in I started to have really crazy dreams consistently, but falling asleep was easy. I work 52h a week in a lab and at home, and I bike into work M-F, so I think that helps a lot. My best advice is to try quitting when you have a busy schedule of some kind. Even if it's just a hobby like making music or something. Staying productive is what helps me not think about it. I stopped craving it by this time as well, it barely crossed my mind.
* 3 weeks in I hang out with some friends who are smoking some very good smelling buds (sense of smell enhanced a lot) and I get a little drunk and almost consider smoking but then I'm like why tf would I do that? Sleep is still easy, finally start having some dreams of using it and waking up super happy that I didn't.
* 4 weeks I'm still coughing up black speckles but not as big of chunks as I used to when I was smoking daily. My mood is finally enhanced, and I don't feel groggy in the morning or stuck to my bed. Finally start getting up at 6am and feeling refreshed. My appetite has increased tremendously. I was the stoner who would only eat small portions but feel hungry a lot and never had the munchies unless my tolerance was really low. 
* 5 weeks in, I can think super clearly now. I can hold a conversation and not go ""what were we just talking about?"" I also don't have that paranoid feeling when talking to people where I feel like they ""know"" what I'm thinking and/or that I'm maintaining too much eye contact. I swear that was one of the worst things about my daily usage. I would sit in lab meeting with my supervisor and feel like she just thought I was weird, or something and it would completely distract me from what we were talking about. You could say, I'm not so ""in my head"" anymore and it's really great. All of these benefits have completely overpowered my craving to use it and I would say the best things that have helped are hanging out with good friends, working a lot, eating healthy and exercising at least 5 days a week.

There have been brief moments in time where I have quit smoking weed for job purposes (drug tests), but I am really trying to stick it out now.

I went through pretty bad weed withdrawals about a year and a half ago for a drug test- extreme anxiety, depression, restlessness and irritability. It was very debilitating.

I ran out of weed last week and decided to stop smoking cold turkey. I was doing fine at first, but on the fourth night I went through an extremely rough time. My anxiety was through the roof, I felt like I was floating outside of my body, my depression crept up on me and I could not stop crying. I was restless, irritable and could not seem to get my thoughts in order. These are feelings that weed used to mask for me. And to top if off, my work situation gives me general anxiety. I became really scared about how much my mind & body had become dependent on weed.

I am lucky enough to have a wonderful family and speaking with my mom on the phone really calmed me down that night. I was finally able to fall asleep.

I discovered this sub-reddit today and am blown away by the support amongst its members. I am really looking forward to continuing my weed sobriety.

I am currently a junior and my addiction to weed has increased beyond my ability to control. It first started off as a weekend thing, then it became a nightly occurrence, and now it has become a daily habit. I get high about two to three times a day. My grades have been taking a shit and I am currently in the lowest point of my life. I realized that I should stop smoking last semester when I started to see how it was affecting my mental health and academic performance. My cumulative GPA was at a solid 3.70 by the start of my junior year (I took summer courses), but I did so poorly last semester, it dropped to a 3.46. I told myself I was going to change and not repeat the same mistakes the following semester, but here I am, still getting high and still falling behind in school. My schoolwork continues to pile up and I have fallen behind on submitting assignments because I simply lack the motivation, discipline and willpower to do it. I have never failed to turn in assignments before and it makes me feel so ashamed to admit it. 

I want to change my habits so badly; I want to be sober so I can get myself to study again. I want my motivation and willpower back so I can pursue my dreams. I have tried to quit over and over again, but none of my attempts have been successful. The people in this community are so kind and helpful and it makes me beyond happy to see others being able to successfully battle their addiction. It is truly inspiring to see and I really want to be able to accomplish the same feet myself. Becoming a doctor is something I have desperately wanted for a really long time. I want to put myself through med school because I know how proud it would make me and the people that I care about in my life. However, with the habits that I currently have, it seems unlikely that I will be able to do it if I continue going down this path. Weed made life more thrilling for me, but I know life is not supposed to solely be rainbows and butterflies. It is the reality of life that fears me. It is the reality of being unsuccessful in the future - or now - that drives me to smoke. 

I know that it is not too late to start making changes, but that is what I have been telling myself ever since I have started college. Even though I certainly do acknowledge that I have improved in many aspects of my life, I have not improved in the fields where I would like improve. I exercised today and I certainly felt significantly better afterwards - I really want to implement short workouts as a part of my daily routine but I do not know where to start. I cleaned around my apartment as well, in the hopes that I would feel accomplished, which I briefly did, but my pile of schoolwork took away the thrill of that. I do not know why I have instilled this irrational fear towards school in my head. I thoroughly enjoy learning and I thoroughly enjoy the majority of the classes that I have taken and am taking, but my fear drives me away from it and instead leads me to procrastinate by smoking pot. I know that if I do not change, I will look back and regret all the choices that I am making today, but not even that seems to give me enough of a push to pull my shit together.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42308235}"

It started out as a way for me to get to sleep as I have a roughish childhood of my mum going to prison for a few years and moving around a lot. 

This was when I was still in school, since then my habit has grown and grown to the point where it literally takes everything from me. When I do work, I spend most of my wages on daily 8ths and 3 5s, I don’t even have sense to buy a large amount. When I don’t work, it takes me ages to actually get a job. (I work in property dealing with rentals). I will apply for jobs, but then get high the next day and not answer calls. 

Smoking weed everyday and spending more than 600 a month has ruined all of my relationships. I lost a gf that I loved so much because I was broke and could never put in the effort to break the cycle. I would borrow money even 20/30 quid to buy weed. I would spend money on weed before paying debts and then borrow money to pay the debts. 

This has now lead me to the situation I’m in now. I am now 24, have lots of business ideas, but have no money, no job, no car and live at home with my mother. I feel like I’ve been a passenger watching my life go by. I see people buying new cars, starting new jobs and generally doing well and these people simply don’t have a £30 a day habit.

This is trauma coming to the surface, this is numbness lifting, this is clarity showing what really has been going on under the hood who knows how long.

This might well be why we've become addicted to weed in the first place. These feelings and negative thoughts about yourself may be what you've tried to escape, and now that you've quit numbing yourself, they are ready to be embraced by your attention because you're actually PRESENT with yourself--body and mind.

Right now you have the possibility to give attention to the part of yourself that has been denied, hurt, abandoned, pushed away, neglected. Not just by you, but by your upbringing and by your past. This ""inner-child"" is asking to be seen, because it carries burdens that only you can lift from its shoulders.

Only you can truly see yourself, no one else will EVER be able to know your experience better than yourself. No one can give the compassion for the darkness that you might've lived with for years, no one but you.

So instead of abandoning the wounded part, the unheard suffering that hasn't gotten the attention it yearns for, try to be compassionate. I know it's hard to love yourself when you know how messed up you are, but hating yourself isn't going to fix yourself and make you whole. That will only push you further away from yourself and your heart is going to close-up tighter.

Sometimes you gotta let yourself complain, shout and scream. Even when you know it's irrational, even if you think it's stupid or weak, just LET IT OUT. Let yourself be heard. Your emotions matter, your thoughts matter. Don't neglect yourself in-order to seem okay, to seem normal, to be ""just fine"".",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59425724}"

22h since I put out my last spliff. It is the second time I properly try to quit after almost 10 years of daily smoking (I am 28) - I have (as so many of us) been thinking and wanting to quit most of this time, but could never bring myself to do it. The longest I went without it (other than on holidays / family house - where I only didn't smoke because there was no way to) was one month in November. This is the second longest. Strangely, since last night I have been VERY emotional and can't stop crying, but don't necessarily feel sad. It is to early for this to be the substance wearing off, right? It hasn't even been a day. Has anyone had this before? I wonder if it's because deep down I know this time I will try for good and my addicted unconscious brain is somehow sad about it? Am I losing my mind?

It doesn’t even feel like 74 days has gone by since my last smoke. I was struggling with the whole trying to have a “cheat day” today since I’ve been stressing a lot with school and life, but then I stumbled upon this page and it saved me. 

I was a heavy smoker for the past 4 years of my life since I was about 17 and my girlfriend, who quit a couple years ago, helped guide me to this sobriety change. It was definitely a struggle to stop but after all the effort, time and thoughts of quitting, I was able to stop 74 days ago. My first month was very hard as I had urges to smoke all the time and had unsuccessful times quitting before. However, after that first month it just got easier and easier. I feel that I found myself again and didn’t even realize how lost I was in life, with myself and even with the people around me throughout my years of smoking. It’s a difficult transition to quit but I saw this video one day that said “healing is some of the toughest work, but it’s worth it in the end”. Healing and recovering is a task and a half and it never really gets easier but that conscious effort you put in every day snd that time and effort you put into yourself is always worth it in the long run. You’ll find yourself being more present, conscious snd rational when it comes to work, school snd most importantly your relationships with the people who matter to you. 

I was really thinking about smoking today since I’m alone and I was basically gonna act like it didn’t happen but this thread helped save me. Thank you to everyone and their stories. I hope somebody reads my post snd feels the same feelings or something similar. 

My advice to anyone trying to quit or in the process of quitting is to just take it one day at a time and to surround yourself with people and resources that will help you reach your goal. Sobriety and healing will always be worth it. You’ll find yourself more present snd enjoying life and in my case, finding your true self once again. So I’ll definitely be making it 75 days tomorrow and I give my best of luck and wishes to anyone else trying to do the same. You are loved snd there’s always people out there who will help you.

I don’t think that marijuana is worth the expense of my health. And I think that it’s important to constantly tell myself that and so that I can propel to continue this journey of cannabis free life. My CHS symptoms involves a lot of digestive issues me waking up super early in the morning with cramps in my stomach but very painful cramps and bloating and a bunch of other things. I wasn’t able to gain an appetite on my own and less I smoke weed and that is tricky for someone who was working from home and constantly needed to smoke before eating so that would leave me being high in my work meetings. I really had to have a talk with myself about prioritizing my health and really understanding that I am so young which is 22 and I have my whole life ahead of me and I don’t want that to be filled with visits to the hospital just because of marijuana and CHS. One thing that came with stopping my daily use was having very vivid dreams which is good and bad because sometimes I wake up feeling the emotions that I had in the dream and it just feels so real. I also had a really bad headaches in the beginning but I have since then been very mindful about my water intake and eating more throughout the day and that has so far helped me immensely. I have also been saving a lot more money and taking a step back from paying so much for marijuana has made me realize how mindlessly I was dropping money without even a second thought just because I felt like I needed it. I realize that I was spending more on Marijuana than my gas and my groceries which is started embarrassing per I’m glad that’s over now.

I haven’t had any real drastic benefits yet, and I don’t expect to for a while. But there are a few that I’ve noticed. 

First off, I’m a lot more productive during the day. The way my mind would work when I was smoking would be that any small basic task or assignment I would complete would make me feel so accomplished and I would reward myself with a bowl, and then proceed to get absolutely nothing done for the rest of the day because I was high and I “just wanted to chill”. And the second benefit I’ve noticed is that I’m a lot more articulate when I speak and I’m actually able to have a coherent conversation with someone without saying “um” 500 times and taking 5 minutes to string together a proper sentence.

What a journey it's been so far, but it's not over yet!","I've not checked in for a long time as life does get in the way, but to think that I'm coming up to my 4th month sober now is mind blowing.

Despite my stint with smoking weed being fairly short lived compared other journeys I've read (was a chronic day and night smoke for the vast majority of 2020, and was on/off for a few years before that), things continue to improve in small increments. Appetite is no longer an issue, head tension has eased off a lot more, my heart no longer races, and general physical withdrawals are pretty much under control. My dreams are still as vivid as ever too, which means my sleep cycles are still getting better and I'm feeling a lot more refreshed as a result.

The only lingering symptom I have mentioned on my past posts is the tinnitus, which I have gotten used to over time but it's still there in the background like some little ear demon nestled in the middle of my head. It'll spike less frequently now but I'm still aware of it during the day, and it's still most noticeable at night when I try to sleep (although it's not completely preventing me from relaxing or doing the things I like). It's still annoying, and I'm also still trying to accept that this will be my new normal for the foreseeable future. I guess its just a sign that I'm still going through the motions of withdrawal and based on what I've read in r/leaves with others experiencing tinnitus, it's gonna take some more time to overcome. Or at least I hope so! 

I did finally manage to get an appointment with an ENT next week so hopefully once they check a few things I can rule out anything that may have caused the tinnitus, as it was only when I quit smoking cold turkey that it became an issue.

Here’s my accountability post.,"I was 13 years old when I had my first joint, and I am 26 years old now. I’ve been smoking every day since, except for a couple year break (where I replaced weed with alcohol).

In that time, there’s been ups and downs. I went from top of my class to dropping out of high school. I moved alone to the most expensive city in my country and I’ve survived here for 7 years. I went to post secondary and got a certificate (nothing special, but hey). I made only one friend. I’ve lived in the same piece of shit apartment since I moved here. I have spent years in therapy to deal with childhood trauma, but I’m throwing away my money because I cannot make proper progress when I smoke right after every session to escape. I lost my beloved grandfather and felt the guilt of not talking to him because I was always too high. I have acquired only three new hobbies that I half-ass partake in, and lost literally all of my other ones that I used to love. I am fighting for a promotion I might not get because I’ve been too high. I have to get tested for ADHD because I can’t focus on shit, and I think it’s from smoking my brains out.

That’s half my fucking life right there. I am so lonely, so miserable, so directionless. I still feel like I’m still 13 years old in many ways.

I’ve been trying to quit again for a long time now, but the irritability and suicidal ideation is quite intense when I try to stop. I haven’t been completely sober a day in my adult life.

Why am I quitting? I want to live finally. I am doing this for my younger self who would be so disappointed in this path I chose. I am doing this for my future self who will hopefully feel much better due to my success that I never would have if I didn’t stop. I do not want to let one more person I love die on me and have this regret of being too high to have a proper relationship with them. I want to find and enjoy my hobbies again. I want to be a more social person, because right now I can hardly hold a conversation in person - I’ve only ever known how to interact with people online.

I knew this day would come eventually. The day that I grow up and start to live my life. No more being in a dissociative brain fog to protect myself. I am willing and ready to expose my mind to all of the horrible shit in life, as well as all of the beauty (hoping I find more of the latter).

tl;dr at bottom

Yesterday, I reached the milestone of being three months sober from THC. I wanted to write a summarization of my experiences because when I was going through the worst of my withdrawals, I would read people’s posts here and know that I was not alone. One of the most important aspects of reading people’s posts was that I knew my symptoms were not unique and that I could make it through the most trying time of my life.

First, I’d like to give the perspective of my usage. My use was extreme. I would smoke an ounce of concentrates (Oil, shatter, etc) every month or about a gram a day for three years. I spent over $19,000 on THC during that time.

I began tapering off of THC in early November because I was having gastrointestinal issues and financial concerns. I am uncertain if this was caused by THC or not. I believe that the oil I had gotten had butane in it or something like that. Either way, I began to taper off THC. The month of tapering was one of mostly stomach and sleep issues. I lost over ten pounds during this month because I was barely able to eat. I would sometimes vomit after only ingesting water and Tums. I would drink nutrition shakes like Ensure, which would give me intense nausea. My diet mostly consisted of white rice and Red Baron pizzas (They’re a comfort food). My sleep was absolutely abysmal. I would sleep between two and four hours a night. I would often take naps to try and get as much sleep as I could, but they were far from restful experiences.

On December 3rd, I stopped smoking entirely. I was roughly in the same position when I began tapering off to when I stopped smoking. I hadn’t noticed any real improvement in my symptoms, but I wanted to make the quitting portion of it as easy as possible. The first week was broken sleep and a terrible appetite as before, except I now had new symptoms. I would sweat terribly at night, often having to change my shirt in the middle of the night when I woke up and have horrible nightmares. After the first week, my anxiety began to gradually get worse. I would feel my heart rate increase and get palpitations. This was extremely scary for me because my older brother passed away from a heart attack. I went to see my doctor, which began to happen bi-weekly throughout my healing process. I began to get into the nasty habit of looking up side-effects of medicines because ‘I wanted to know what could happen’. When I paired this knowledge with my anxiety, I began to experience the side-effects of every medicine that I took and I began to become convinced that I was going to die from a heart condition.

After a couple weeks, I began to eat a bit more. My appetite became better and I having less frequent stomach pain, vomiting, etc. My weight loss peaked at 30lbs lost. My night sweats began to subside. My nightmares were becoming worse and worse, along with my anxiety. I would now begin to have night terrors, which would jerk me awake several times within the first hour of attemping to sleep. I began to become obsessive with my heart rate and purchased a heart monitor. I wore it constantly and began to check my vitals every few minutes. This fed into my belief that I was going to have a heart attack and made my anxiety much worse. I began to spiral which lasted into the second month.

My anxiety was so high that I checked myself into a mental hospital. I spent a week there and it was an outstanding experience. I was able to speak with people who suffered from various mental illness or substance troubles as well. I was able to partake in classes that gave me skills to cope with my anxiety and other issues that I wouldn’t have had access to otherwise. My willingness to quit and my desperation to get better forced me to give the program my all. I was able to reap innumerous benefits. After I left the mental hospital, I returned home and immediately packed my things. I drove south to be with my family, which was another extremely positive situation. I have been surrounded by family for a month and been able to enjoy the sunshine.

I celebrated my third month of THC sobriety yesterday and I feel indescribably better. The only remaining symptom is mild anxiety that I can deal with in only a few minutes. My weight and sleep have stabilized. I hope this helps someone. Thanks for reading!

\---------------- tl;dr ---------------

I would smoke an ounce a month or a gram a day for three years. Tapered off a month. Sober for 3 months now.

Symptoms: Tapering – Intense Insomnia, intense stomach trouble, (nausea, diaherria, can’t eat)

Week 1 – Intense Insomnia, Night sweats, intense stomach trouble (vomiting, nausea, diaherria, can’t eat), vivid nightmares, mild anxiety

Week 2 & 3 – Intense Insomnia, Moderate stomach trouble (nausea, diaherria, can’t eat), vivid nightmares and night terrors, intense anxiety

Week 4 – Intense Insomnia, Mild stomach trouble (nausea), vivid nightmares and night terrors, uncontrollable anxiety

Week 5 – Moderate Insomnia, vivid nightmares and night terrors, uncontrollable anxiety. Total Weight loss 30lbs.

Week 6 – Mild Insomnia, vivid dreams, uncontrollable anxiety

Week 7 & 8 – Mild sleep issues, vivid dreams, manageable anxiety

Week 9+ - Returning to normal slowly and surely.

Things that Helped: Friends and Family, a support network is crucial, I needed people I could call at 5am sobbing.

Hobbies, I picked up painting and playing the saxophone.

Praying, even though I’m not very religious, I sometimes think of it as talking to myself and putting things in perspective. I had no control over my emotions and putting faith in something greater than myself was huge.

Meditation, much like prayer, I used this time to self-talk and ease my mind.

Exercise, when my heart rate would go nuts, I would start to work out. It felt like taking control of something that was out of my control. Also, it burns the THC out of your system faster.

Reading, read self help books or spiritual books. My emotions were completely out of control, so having soothing passages to read were helpful. I read lots of books on spirituality and Buddhism.

Help with sleeping, I made a routine and stuck to consistent bedtimes. I would make tea, light a candle, play soothing piano music and read a book for about an hour. This routine helped me relax. It took over a week to get any real results, but it was worthwhile.",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59234893}"

Tried several different medications and ultimately stopped taking them when I discovered weed helped calm me down. It started with just a hit one every few days or so. Over the last year, especially with covid, I began smoking every day when I got home from work to numb my anxiety. I then developed a spending habit and blew through all of my savings. I'm done.

I'm on day 4. Im nauseous every morning and I'm having mental breakdowns as soon as I get home. But today is easier than yesterday and I know tomorrow will be better than today. For the first time in over a year I was able to save 1 paycheck.

Unfortunately now all I want to do when I get home from work is sleep. I find no enjoyment in any hobbies or anything I used to find fun. I just want to enjoy life again. I want to be happy again.

I’m addicted to marijuana. First got high at 14(mid 2014) but started “stoning” (smoking daily) when I was 15 turning 16( beginning of 2016) and am turning 21 in July so currently 4 years almost 5 years of chronic smoking. I did however stop smoking mid 2016 and the rest of that year and began in beginning 2017. 

Basically I realised about a year ago I had a problem and have tried to stop so many times but they have all been fails. I even went to NA last year and attended meetings and it was going well until personal issues arose. 

I feel like I am not living up to my full potential and my perspective of life is really pessimistic. I’m also super lazy and unmotivated to do anything - doesn’t help that I’m unemployed (just qualified) while waiting for registration in my field of study so I can apply for a job. 
I’m sat around the house all day doing nothing but smoking weed and feeling sorry for myself. I have planned out stuff to do for myself to keep me busy but every morning I wake up and I just crave a bowl. And then I tell myself “just one more” ... 30 min later I’m grinding up some more bud - in spite of myself and it just keeps going in a circle like that. 

My relationship with my parents is going downhill due to my moods when I’m not high and I feel like all social skills have escaped me I just can’t relate to other people. 

Lmao sorry this is hella long and more of a rant but if anyone out there feels the same or is in a similar situation just like hmu or some shit idk. Like I wanna stop but I physically and mentally can’t no matter what I do.

I wish I could write my entire experience in this post, but I feel that it would be the length of a book haha.

The first month or so was absolute hell for me. One day something 'switched' in my brain, and everything I had lost in weed withdrawal magically returned. The main barrier for me to maintain my sobriety was my life being fun. I believed with all my being that weed is what made life fun, magic, vibrant etc. I can happily say that life is so much more fun now. That fun is found in different places now, and it does take some getting used (my weed-fun and sober-fun are almost polar opposites honestly).

If you're suffering in withdrawals right now, the best advice I can give is to be compassionate to yourself. The more I rejected my urges, the worse it got for me. If you feel like doing nothing productive and watching shitty tv shows, just do it. Let yourself be. Try not to get caught up in how futile or meaningless your desires appear to be. You will return to your normal life when the time is right. You're going through an incredibly difficult transformation, one that pays off in the long run if you stick to it. And if you relapse, it's okay, you can keep quitting, it took me 3 years of quitting to come this far.

But they get less frequent and less severe day by day, and I don’t let negative feelings ruin my day/week anymore. Actually I get a craving maybe once or twice a week, usually on Friday or Saturday (predictably). I don’t consider that to be often and I’m not sitting around constantly thinking about these drugs I’ve left behind. Onward and upward!

Overall the big picture is I feel peaceful and I like who I am sober, so I will stay sober. Like I said, there is no mystery to any of this. Want to change something about your life? Ask yourself what you’re willing to do, make a plan, and then do it. I suffered extended withdrawal to get where I am. You will suffer too. So what? Break on through to the other side because the other side has been pretty fucking good so far.

I wish you all strength and peace on your journey. If you want to do it, you have the strength inside yourself, but the key is you have to want it. I will be back for my 4 month update.

Since I am still living with the parents, I never even wanted to chance bringing my stash home. Instead, I’d keep it hidden outdoors. One day, I go to light up and it’s all gone. I am crushed. Mainly, because all of my things ended costing a lot of money, but also because I felt like I needed cannabis to keep me sane. This is the complete opposite of how I now feel. 

It seems as though it was a blessing in disguise that all of my stash got taken. If that person who took all my stuff didn’t do so, I would still be an absolute shell of a person. I have made tremendous steps to getting rid of my dependence on bud. I have been able to read about the people on here who have sadly relied too much on the devils lettuce. No judgement at all as I was on the exact same path. I am just so happy that after 5 whole days of not even touching pot that I am not going to turn out as someone with a crippling addiction. 

It is so satisfying to take back your reality and not hide behind a stupid little high the lasts maybe 2 hours. 
There is now a fire lit inside me and sobriety is just so amazing. I am able to FINALLY stay full after eating and never have that gut wrenching feeling of the munchies. I hated that. Eating just so I was fulfilled when smoking and then having to eat a shit ton more just to stay satisfied. This sub has helped me beyond belief and I am just so glad that I’ve been able to recognize my wrong doings.

I’ve joined this community as tool for support and accountability bc I don’t feel comfortable putting this struggle with addiction on family or friends.  

I’m 43 and have been a daily weed smoker since my 20s (most of my adult life). In the beginning I used it only at night, to help relax and sleep. Eventually my usage crept up and up to the point where I am smoking all day. I work in creative industries and have been using it to help let go of fears and inhibitions around creativity and to help reach a focused flow state. Unfortunately, as many will know, this drug induced short-cut, only works for a short period of time and leaves me trying to chase that high for the rest of the day, ultimately feeling lethargic, foggy, irritable and down (not to mention shameful). Like many here, I believe it has diminished my abilities to focus, to feel creative, to feel confident, to feel connected, etc.,etc. And has taken a toll on my physical and mental health. And as Im getting older I feel a lot of regret over wasting so many formative, career building years of my youthful adulthood.

For the last three years I have been trying hard to quit and have been able to stop for varying periods of weeks and months but always seem to relapse. I think one of the things that has sabotaged my recovery is that once I quit for a longish period and have gotten past the withdrawal symptoms and cravings, I think that it will be ok to just have a couple causal tokes with friends or whatever the scenario. However, I have learned (for myself) that doesn’t go well. That high makes me just want more and before I know it, I’m back to my old daily habits (I know there are probably other underlying emotional issues but can't afford therapy, so it's DIY for me). 

Most recently I had quit for six weeks only to relapse last Friday because of a toothache - feeling crappy induced a very strong craving that I wasn’t expecting or ready for. (I’m Canadian so weed is now legal here which makes it more difficult to quit bc you can buy it so easily). Anyhow after smoking for 5 days straight, I threw out the weed I had bought and I’m back on the quitting road. 

Full disclosure, I also wanted to mention that I am still using an edible at night, to help with sleep but do plan to cut this out, as soon as I feel more stable with not smoking.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.69710255}"

Anxiety and depression are really hitting too, feeling a deep sense of despair and finding no joy in anything. I don’t think covid lockdown is helping any of this either, it’s a hard time to quit.

Hoping things will improve as I keep pushing through, wishing you all good luck in your process and here’s hoping things improve as the days rolls on.

i dont wanna talk about my addiction as of yet, because i luckily have a lot of people to talk to, when needed and i have the feeling that i even talked about it to much (bragged almost) when i tried to stop for a while in the past. just mentioning where i am: right now i didnt smoke for 15 days, which is kinda not bad for me, as i am a rlly heavy stoner for 15 years, as most of you guys. 

but i wanna do it in a more silent way this time, more for myself, so i just mentioned it to my flatmate and thats it. record lies at 18 days with me. so thumbs up, i can break it this time. i am kinda curious what happens in the coming weeks, but i dont wanna pressure myself or anything. officially i'm just on a little break. its a very different approach to the other times i tried to stop. (sorry if my english is not perfect)

what i actually wanted to share is a piece of lyric, from a song, that just came out in my country. i fits quite well to how i feel right now. so here it comes:

*- Stay A Little Longer*

  *You don’t have to see your life’s purpose now*

 *and all the time if you can’t find it anywhere*

  *Just stay a little longer* 

 *Maybe in a minute you’ll see* 

 *Maybe tomorrow you’ll feel*

 *Maybe on friday you’ll know* 

 *Maybe next year you’ll be glad*

  *that you stayed a little while longer*

 *to see what else can break*

 *to see what else can ache*

 *to make another mistake* 

&#x200B;

its a very beautiful song... of course its about something entirely else then weed. but i still like it. i'm sure with a little research u are able to find it on youtube.

its a beautiful platform here. maybe i'm gonna participate a bit more, maybe i'm gonna be quiet again or stop reading. but all of you: great job, keep going",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.67043906}"

But what I want y’all to know is that today for around the 8th time I’m giving it all I got this time to make sure I’m done for a very long time . Now the first year of me smoking I was smoking heavily around half a oz a week sometimes a lil more and that’s not counting the dabs or the pen. So when I first quit I pretty much had a mental breakdown and that’s where I realized that weed was really the cause of it lol. I hadn’t experienced anything like that before so I was pretty confident that maybe me smoking so much played a big factor. So I quit for the first time and stayed strong for at least 3 and a half months . Oh by the way my withdrawals were fucking intense I’m talking horrible nigh sweats no sleep and nightmares lol . But after I quit after the first month I remember having this burst of energy one morning and that lasted for like a few days almost like I felt normal again lol I don’t know it was weird. Also during this time I was very motivated into fitness i lost a ton of weight and put on some muscle and still currently am lol. But anyways after those three and half months I was like you know what I think I can treat myself just once... I got this I’m working out daily I’m eating healthy as shit life is good .... yeah that was the last time I ever took a break that long and it sucks because I know I can do it I always make it 2 weeks and same shit I think I can and boom I smoke another two weeks so basically the last year I’ve been smoking off and on 2 weeks off 1 week on.. but the problem is how much I smoke during that binge usually 2 grams a day if not more . Now I just got off a 11 day binge my longest binge in awhile and honestly to me it’s not fun anymore it’s not enjoyable and maybe it’s my fault I ruined weed for myself and maybe I honestly just need a big break . Now it’s crazy because even though I have had more than one withdrawal , they have not been as intense as my first one these last three withdrawals usually last like 2 days but nothing major or crazy .. then again I don’t ever make it past two weeks so who knows.. guys thanks for reading and if y’all Wana know something or ask me something let me know thanks.

For those who haven’t it’s essentially a coming of age movie that depicts high school kids of different cliques hanging out drinking beers and smoking weed (and some drama here and there). I think the most interesting part is that now it doesn’t feel as cut and dry as who are the “good” characters and who are the “bad”. Everyone has their own motivations in life and smoking weed doesn’t necessarily make you a good or bad person, you’re actions do. Happiness and “just living” is key to living a worthwhile life. 

Also, although I tell myself all the time I “should’ve started smoking later” I realize now that there were multiple reasons why I was a pothead in high school and then college. I was happy. I was happy smoking weed, working my low stakes delivery job, thinking solely about how I’m gonna get laid or roll up some joints and hang out with the boys. Now, I know it’s not good for me anymore because of those same reasons (gotta move on at some point) but in a way I’m glad I came to that realization when the stakes were relatively low. Now I can sober up, realign my priorities, and make something of my life. Those memories will always be good and I know i’ll get nostalgic for those times again but that’s what they should be, memories of a good time. Going forward, I don’t want to say “weed was horrible it was the worst decision i made”, I want to make peace with those decisions and understand why sobriety is better, but remind myself that it wasn’t all bad because at the time, it was the right thing to do.

But one thing I noticed yesterday that I'm learning how I can change my habits for the better with this process of quitting.

1. Tell yourself not-now rather than never again to make change in the moment

2. Ask yourself is this good for me and then be honest about why you are doing what you are doing

3. Be accountable to a community and use something outside yourself for motivation

4. Put yourself first and challenge any automatic decisions

These habits are helping me change other parts of my life along with quitting. Going to bed on time, working out eating better, all are getting influenced by these behaviors.

Weed didn't just take my motivation, it took away all my desire to be better and to invest in myself. Now I have that back!

Best of luck to you all. Keep going, keep trying. Whenever you get there, however long it takes, it is worth it.

I use a countdown app to track my progress and I used to check it everyday.. but each day I did I noticed I was craving pot more because it would remind me of what I am doing. I still use the app, but I really made an effort to not check it and throw myself into activities like working out and my work to keep me busy. I guess I really got good at that because the last time I checked the app it was day 11. Today is day 32! 

I started smoking in college after exams with some classmates to decompress. I was on and off until about 3 years ago where it became a daily activity for me. At that point, I started to buy my own weed/bowl - a huge mistake. I started to notice a few months ago I couldn't sleep without taking a hit, and when I took an edible I had to take 30mg to even feel a slight buzz. What really lit the fire under my ass was that I couldn't remember things - my short-term memory was shot.

Stuff like the details of what I did over the weekend took me a few minutes to remember or when an event I agreed to go to was I couldn't remember and had to look it up in my phone calendar. I especially couldn't remember important stuff for work and stopped paying close attention in meetings - this led to feelings of imposed syndrome at work which stressed me out.

I like to think of myself as smart, but far from any type of genius, but it got to the point my memory was so bad my girlfriend would joke I had the brain of an 80-year-old.. that's when I knew if others were noticing my memory was slipping what else was happening I didn't recognize yet that was affecting others.

I realized didn't have a hobby to help me destress - I have a problem. Yes, have. not had. 

I'm very proud of myself for hitting 30 days, especially when I've had so many day 1s, days 7s, 13s, you name it. I was the king of the relapse because I would let myself have a hit after a week or so of being clean thinking ""hey I was clean a week, this isn't a problem, I can stop whenever I want"". I would think I could handle it then look at myself in the mirror two months later after daily smoking again and be disgusted wondering what just happened.

The key to my success thus far: 

1) Put my ego aside and realize I have a problem. Not a social ""hobby""

2) I really had to accept quitting doesn't happen in a day, it's a process that is ongoing

3) I've always been active, but really focusing on getting to and making progress in the gym and on what I eat - getting addicted to personal growth mentally and physically. 

4) Throw it out. EVERYTHING. Any piece, any leftover shake, whatever it is - if it's in the house or the dealer's number if in your phone **it's going to have a gravitational pull on you.**

I'm happy to report my memory is SO much better just after 30 days. I'm excited for it to only get better and back to normal - I feel like rain man! 

Hopefully, the beginning of my journey will help hit home for someone willing to read all this who is struggling on whatever day you are on - no matter if it's day 1 for the first time or 100th time.

I'm under a lot of stress. I'm moving soon and I'm stressed looking for a place. I'm also stressed about not having a job, which stresses me about even wanting to buy weed because my money is uncertain, which stresses me in this loop of feeling like I can deal with the stress better high but don't wanna spend the money because I need it to move but I feel like I can handle all this better high... I have so much anxiety and I'm looking into alternative ways to make money (sex work probably, although I'm also selling a lot of stuff for the move). I messaged my dealer this morning but haven't responded back after he said he had what I wanted. So I haven't committed to copping. And tbh I am thinking about the relief of being high but also the guilt I'd feel spending money on that when I have to pay money to go see places this week and also for movers in a couple weeks. Part of me feels like a hundred bucks is not much so fuck it, but thats a day of Ubers across the city... I keep going back and forth. I hate the way I feel but I don't entirely want to buy weed, I just don't want to feel like this. It was easier quitting before because I was slightly less stressed. Now it feels like a mess, I'm really trying to hold it together. Last night around 12-2am I was screaming and singing loud as fuck in my apartment because 1) fuck my neighbors they have not been considerate and now I'm moving so fuck them, and 2) I felt like it was all I could do to escape the mental anguish. And it felt good. I let myself scream at the top of my lungs and my throat is still messed up from smoking so it wasnt the girthiest scream but it felt good to get it out. But yesterday I thought about cutting for the first time in over a year! I know that's just because I want to feel something different and that pain is relieving when I'm so stressed, but I don't want to hurt myself anymore because I've built of my self-love in the last year, but the fact that I was fantasizing about it is not great to me. I just want to have all this shit taken care of because the move and the costs associated with it are really why I'm so stressed.

My parents have graciously allowed me to come back to live with them and have given me very few rules to follow and the first is no drugs. I moved in a few days ago but I couldn't stand the thought of NEVER smoking weed so I brought just one bud with me reasoning that I could smoke once a week off the property and it doesn't hurt anyone not to know. I don't like to drink or do other drugs I reasoned it's like treating yourself to a cold beer after a hard day's work. But instead of saving it I've been sneaking into the wooded area with my one hitter twice a day. That small dose is perfect for stopping the constant static in my head and getting some work done or fall asleep, I wouldn't consider it a problem if it didn't put me at risk of losing my housing.

It is the same thing over and over again for me. I quit weed, because my mind has associated it with crazy anxiety and not reaching my full potential. After I quit, almost a year after, my mind forgets the negative associations, and only makes me remember the good times. So I smoke again, and before I know it, I'm back at daily smoking. 

If I have to be honest, only the first three times were fun smoking again. After that, it was just filling a void that was left when I smoked. I had to continue to smoke. It felt like new again. I felt the childlike wonder again.

So here are some of the things I've noticed from the past 3 months.

- My sleep schedule is fucked. I sleep at 6 AM and wake up at 4 PM. Because every night I get the feeling that I should 'enjoy the night to the fullest', because I'm gonna quit soon. Been saying that for 2 months now.

- I am less available to my family, evading my Mom. This is causing me a lot of stress, because I have amazing, deep, genuine family relationships when sober.

-  I am less productive at work. This one is a big one. I am a music video maker, mainly for rap music. I've just landed an amazing job in another country, making good money. But you guessed it. Everyone smokes weed around me and lives a successful life (career, money, fame wise). While their addictions can be used as motivation, I am using their addictions as an excuse to live that lifestyle. My roommate is a succesful artist and a good friend here. He and I have smoked a shit ton of weed the past couple months. 

Anyway, I want to talk about my work a little bit more. Since I've quit weed last year, I've made great career advancements. Smoking weed again was some what of a ''celebration'' thing of my new lifestyle the last months. It felt good to just hang out with the people here, them creating awesome songs, me creating awesome music videos for them. Getting high, creating art, you know the vibe.

But that was only temporary. That was in the beginning. No lie, it was fun, but temporary. Right now it has come to a point where it's actually affecting my work in a negative way. I am less prepared on shoots, less creative, less inclined to create awesome shit, because I already get most of my dopamine from weed, so dopamine from real life achievements is a lower priority to my brain. I can feel it.

When I quit, I can really feel the difference. I do a lot more than is expected of me, which benefits my future self and career. When I'm a daily smoker, I do just enough. Just enough to create a good music video.


Anyway, I've gotten to the point of quitting every day again. And that also has an effect on my self confidence and my strength from my beliefs. I am becoming a man of no principles. Eek. That's what happens when you go to sleep every night promising yourself that you're gonna quit only to get high again the next day.

That high that you always regret. The one in which after you feel guilty and lazy. Anxiety about your own doings. Feeling weak because you've failed again. Ugh.

I woke up today with all those shitty feelings. I don't want to escape those feelings. I want to use those feelings like how a human being is supposed to feel those feelings. Process them. Use them. And learn from them. I slept at 8 AM and woke up at 4 PM. On my Mom's birthday, for fucks sake. I was supposed to visit her at 12 PM. It's a shitty feeling to have chosen for weed instead of making sure your Mom has an awesome birthday. Something I'd never do with my sober mind. I am not myself as a daily smoker. And it sucks.

I have learned that I have, yet again, failed at moderation of weed. I have gotten back into the chain reaction, which is so hard to get out of. It's so hard to get into the right mindset. The mindset in which you see this habit for what it is: Time and energy wasting. Robbing you from real happiness. Robbing you from the most important things in life: relationships, self peace, self control, self love. 

I look forward to waking up on time again, well rested, preparing a nice coffee, sitting at my desk in the morning, getting some editing work done, with my lo-fi playlist on the background. Creating videos because I love creating them. Not because I am high and need to make use of my highness (which makes me less creative in the end). Calling up my Mom or other family with real genuine interest and love, not because 'I have to'.

I look forward to not needing a drug that only has negative effects on me. I look forward to the peace I will get when that cognitive dissonance is cured.

I look forward to not having my dopamine receptors hijacked. I look forward to having actual motivation to do other activities than getting high and playing videogames. Like making music with my roommate. 2 days ago, when we were both high, I got the motivation to make a fun bs freestyle song with him for the fun of it. In only 20 minutes, I lost motivation for it, and we just played videogames instead. Oh, how different it'd be if I was sober. I am happy that I have also learned those things in my year of being sober. I am using that to my advantage.

I look forward to being myself again, man. 

So here's to day one you guys. That's what it all comes down to. Not smoking today.

There will be a time, some time tonight even, where someone in my proximity will roll and light up a joint, and I will get a craving. There's been a lot of times where people have smoked around me and I didn't partake. It is very easy for me when I am in the right mindset, and actually believe in that mindset. I am doing my best to stay in this right mindset: I can't moderate weed, and I shouldn't want to, because it robs me from so many important things in life. And if I feel myself truly slipping and going into relapse, I will, like my previous 'successful' attempts, come back to this amazing subreddit. You guys have helped me a lot of times in the past. I hope that this post will help someone too.

Have a good one you guys. Today my rational brain is in control. Today I will not smoke. And I will enjoy not smoking, because I am not losing anything. I am gaining a lot of things.",79,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37981632}"

I turn 30 this month. I honestly can't really explain how I quit only that it was different this time. I was a heavy user, easily smoked an Oz a week and eventually moved on to an eighth of dabs every 3-4 days. I actually moved to a state where it became legal and it was half the reason I relocated in the first place. Ever since I started smoking, I always had these gnawing thoughts that it was limiting my potential. And I've always wanted more in life, but I just felt like MJ would always hold me back. Because it literally stems down to my self control. I would normally fiend and easily talk myself into smoking after only half a day. Saying I would quit on X day, tomorrow, etc. I feel like without control of myself to say no, to abstain from the sweet leaf I would never accomplish the real goals I had in life. And as I got older, these feelings magnified. And well.. as I drew closer to 30 something I guess you could say ""clicked"". I looked back at the last 12 years and realized I was still in the same position I was when I graduated high school. I never progressed with my physical goals which was to lose weight as I've always been obese and financially I still was living paycheck to paycheck. As I reflected on this, I told myself I did not want to go into my 30s and be doing the same things.. not getting anywhere in life. And that required a significant change. So I vowed to change the one thing that was consistent and that was consuming THC. Weed made me disregard my goals, and procrastinate. To the point it lasted all the way through my 20s. I can't control my eating habits when I get high which destroys any progress I've made in losing weight. I also play poker seriously and realized if I wanted to actually be successful I need to think with clarity. Weed made me way to creative in spots and I always bluffed off major amounts of cash. I used to think it mellowed me and helped me from tilting but I was wrong. I've been a losing player for the last 5 years but last month I'm actually in the green for 13k. I attribute a majority part to not smoking. Because like I said, when I smoke.. I have no self control or discipline to do the right things cause I always had weed to fall back on if things went awry. I've also managed to lose 15lbs in the last month cause I don't binge eat as much anymore and am more conscious about my caloric intake.

I guess I can say.. eventually after 12 years of doing the same bullshit, making the same mistakes and realizing I needed to change helped solidify my decision to quit. This time is different completely as I have zero cravings, or desire to go back to my daily content. I know quitting MJ is not a forever thing. It's just a now thing.. because I have wasted too much time and now it's time to shift gears. My convictions to change for the better has led me thus far. When I make it where I want in life,  MJ will always be there. But for now, I gotta say.. peace.

As far as any advice I can give if trying to quit.. ask yourself truly deep down, do you want to wake up ten or twenty years from now.. doing the same shit? If not, realize how MJ is affecting you entirely. The mindset shift is powerful.",29,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58668023}"

I have generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression and found weed helped me fully relax. Most my prescription medications were either too weak or too strong but I found mild medication and weed to be the perfect combination for a really long time. 

Then I realized about 3 years ago it started harming more than helping. My heart rate had started to regularly increase every time I smoked to over 100 bpm or more. I would half ass everything, feel even more depressed because I never wanted to do anything but watch tv, and couldn’t remember much of anything. Even though I never smoked before going to work, having a hard time remembering things was really starting to affect my day to day job. I’ve been trying to quit off and on for 3 years. I’ve been journaling about it as well and it makes me disappointed looking back at those entries and my attempts to quit. 

My husband and I want to start a family (I’m young and we’ve been trying a year and a half) and while I don’t know if smoking weed is what has been holding us back I know it is not exactly great for fertility for men or women. We are trying some pretty intense things soon with our fertility clinic and this is really the driving force behind me wanting to take it seriously this time. 

I’m on day 8 and really struggling with the side affects. I can’t sleep and work a pretty hectic job, so when I’m tired my work suffers. The lack of sleep side effect is mostly what’s made me relapse in the past. Not to mention I’ve had anxiety around falling asleep since I was young. Also the night sweats and lack of appetite are the worstttt. I’m starving during the day but feel too nauseous to eat. 

I know this will all be worth it when I have a healthy baby and I’m truly present with them rather than checking out. But it’s really hard right now.

I’m on day 3 now (for the 2nd time) and I don’t really have a ton of cravings, but my bad thoughts peak most at night, and it’s happening right now as I’m typing this 😔 I just have regrets bc I’m leaving college in 3 months. Did well in school but feel no direction right now and I’m having a really hard time deciding my career path and I feel weed inhibited that.  I made some friends but not a lot or ones that I’m that close too. Met some women too, but I wish I had a gf and I feel my opportunities are gonna be more limited. Just feel that I was so held back by weed and it hurts me a lot.

Just wanted to check in after having not smoked or eaten edibles for a week now. I'm a long term marijuana addict. I'm 41 and have been smoking off and on since I was 16. I've had hundreds of attempts to quit over the years, but this one feels different. I'm finally coming to accept and surrender to the fact that I'm a marijuana addict and I am powerless to my addiction. Marijuana has consumed my life for a long time. I am currently in an outpatient programme and I am attending Marijuana Anonymous meetings which are really helping me to come to terms with being an addict. I'm finding a lot of grief and loss at not being able to smoke again, but most of all realising the hell of being addicted to weed. Its such a pernicious addiction, masquerading as something benign, something I felt I could give up easily and something that our culture has so much denial about. I totally accept that some people can smoke or consume weed and not become addicted. All power to you if you can do that. Since I started smoking weed I NEVER had any control over it and would smoke or consume it till it was gone. I've spent two decades in denial about this and felt that ""the next time..."" I get weed I'd be able to put limits on how much I smoked. This is addiction and the face of denial as now I'm in recovery I can see how I never ever had control over my weed consumption. I feel sad that its taken me this long to come to terms with my addiction. But I know there are lots of us out there like this and I feel the cultural denial about weed addiction needs to change. One thing I'm pretty frightened about is forgetting about how unmanageable and hellish my life became when I was in active weed addiction. I don't want to forget this as I know the addict inside me will say ""...look now you've been x days clean it proves you can use again and have limits""...this is bullshit and part of the addictive denial. Anyway friends, its been a long journey for me but I never want to go back to that weed addict I was. If you identify with this and can't stop using weed please seek help. I really needed to seek external help in the form of an outpatient programme and MA to stop.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.77127796}"

I have been experiencing a bunch of the physical withdrawal symptoms strongly, such as insomnia, loss of appetite, random shakes/cold sweats, and an uneasy stomach most of the time. These uncomfortable feelings go away but then come back in waves and I am just wondering if anyone has had the same experiences, and if so, when did all of this end??

I have been fine in terms of not thinking about weed, until the last few weeks. My brain has been testing me and I've had this urge to smoke. Like really bad. It hasn't caused me to entertain the thought, in fact it never goes anywhere and passes just like any thought, but the feelings are there in those moments.

When I smell weed on the street, god does it smell so fucking good. Literally smells like when I first started smoking, that yummy haze. It's so strange that it's become so appealing because I know that it's really bad for me, and I know I can't use it responsibly. Every time I smoke it it instantly becomes a habit. I can't do it. Not only that but I become an anxious mess, and that's when I usually quit my jobs because they become too much (Have ADD) and I have just acquired my dream job in IT that's giving me the opportunity to learn a lot. There's NO way I'm fucking that up.

I think coronavirus has made it much easier, because I haven't been able to see my friends (Lockdown), who are all weed smokers. It has meant I've been quite lonely and isolated. It's for the greater good though. I haven't put smoke in my lungs, or anything for that matter in a really long time. If I smoke weed again, I'll start smoking tobacco. And tobacco is fucking disgusting honestly.

If someone is reading this and thinking that it's not worth it, I honestly can't reassure you at the moment. Life is really boring, but that's because of many factors. I know it'll get better. Just can't do fucking drugs. MUCH better than if I was high for sure!

I am losing weight now, not obese or anything but I weighed myself and I am about 15KG over the average. So I am looking after myself and doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and it's working so far. Dropped 1.3KG since last week. It's also been nice controlling my eating because after quitting smoking tobacco and consuming weed, I didn't realise how much I was whoring food and really being unhealthy. Put on a lot of weight not doing much, again, unemployment and coronavirus lockdowns, but still.

Look after yourself guys. I can't remember if this is the longest I've gone without weed, but it might be. It's easy once you're here, but it's still a reminder in my brain occasionally.

I can’t speak for everyone but I know my personal experience with it was believing it to be helping me at first and not realizing until it was too late how much damage it had actually done to my brain. 

I try and journal and make lists of reasons why I’m quitting to remind myself i’m doing this for a reason. It gets overwhelming sometimes though because I’m really easily influenced by other people.

I'm 26 and i have been smoking weed for like 8 years. When i began when I was 17-18, i felt like weed gave me super brain power. I would watch documentaries on youtube and feel like my brain was expanding and i was seeing things about the world I had never seen before. I could smoke weed and cry my heart out listenning to a symphony, or looking at beautiful painting, everything was 1000x more interresting. Smoking weed allowed me to project myself in the future, i was really young and weed allowed me to live my fantasies about the person I wanted to become. 

But year after year weed began to take more and more place. As soon as I started smoking I knew that  i liked it too much and it was a very dangerous slope, but i tought to myself ""getting in college will make you stop"" but it didn't. I started studying physics in university but the program was very hard and being able to smoke weed had become my number one priority So i quit after one semester, telling myself and my family that ""it wasn't for me"", but I knew deep down it was a lie and that I was beginning to fuck up my life and my dreams because of weed. I tried to quit so many times but when I can't smoke i feel emptiness, boredome, and I reflet on how i didn't grow as an adult as much as I wanted and it depresses me af. I always manage to do some mental gymnastic to convince myself that there's nothing to it and ""one more joint wont make a difference"". Now, I see my health decline, i have shortness of breath, and I don't even feel high when i smoke since my tolerance is so high.  I want to liberate myself from weed once and for all. Does anyone see some similarity with their own story and want to share some advice ? Thanks.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50506836}"

* First week or two, felt really good and determined, thought of my sober self as a long lost friend arriving on a boat, that I was waiting for her to make the journey across the ocean
* third and fourth weeks, felt irritable and pretty shitty and depressed
* fifth and six weeks, have started to have less cravings and more of a sense of normalcy in my life, have started going to bed at 11 nightly which is helping a lot

Benefits I've felt:

* Less anxiety, shame, self loathing
* Able to wake up more easily in the morning
* Able to keep my house clean and cook for myself
* Enjoying music and food more, actually
* Enjoying resting more and actually valuing my time off of work instead of just falling into a hole

I don't miss the 5 years (20-25) I spent hating myself and feeling out of control. But I also understand that I was not emotionally ready to stop, and that the plant was serving a purpose in my life at that point. I think being committed to quitting helped a lot. I had tried at least 5 times before this, but never made it more than a week.

Over the last three years I would get ravenously hungry in the afternoon, so that I've gone from a 2xl to a 4xl in that time. But now I don't feel like a bottomless pit, and it feels great. I started to count my calories around Feb 10th and I already feel more room in my clothes. Yesterday I got to tell my therapist about my progress and it felt so great. I have this positive momentum now, and I don't want to give it up. I know I will probably face more relapses, but I've been able to remove the stimulus of constant use by only buying the lowest amount of weed possible when I do relapse; a couple joints.

I know everyone is different, but what caused a breakthrough for me was learning about psychology. I have a plan to go back to school for psych, and my interests are academic, so my therapist recommended a couple therapeutic manuals. They helped me see my own defensive structure in context to my addiction, that my addiction was the Acting Out of my Denial through Withdrawal. These books allowed me to understand what was happening in my mind, and come to the resolution that I could not allow myself to live being dictated by my defenses.

Eventually i figured i had to give up the shatter, as my tolerance was so high i was basically immune to it, so i tried to ease off by switching to weed. then i found myself going for a ""walk"" like 3 or 4 times a day, and id take my bong with me evry time, because only bong chops would get me high. for the past year tho ive graduated to actual dabs, mainly because i can do them in my apartment without the smell being too bad. it got to the point where i was taking like 4 or 5 fat dabs, and burning through about a gram of shatter a day. for the past month or so ive managed to bring it down to one dab a day, and yesterday i decided i was gonna go all out and finally go cold turkey. im a little scared, as i literally cant even imagine living life and never getting high right now, but it needs to be done. Any advice you might have for me would be great, as im kinda lost and overwhelmed right now. thanks for taking time to read my post, if you did",8,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48209533}"

I always was a nightly smoker for years and couldn't ever stop. Even with a few breaks I would eventually cave and smoke again. I Recently saw a good doctor which specializes in quitting weed and he gave some of the best advice. Some people can smoke fine with no issues but the most driven and motivated people are the ones who feel the side effects of weed (anxiety etc.). It is so true because it does hold you back from doing all the things you need/want to do which will induce stress and anxiety. At first I started it because of sleep and he explained you aren't even getting real Sleep (REM) and that is why you are waking up more tired which is also true. 

It might be fun for some people at a particular point in their life and it may have been fun to smoke weed in your past it is nolonger fun in your current state and it definitely isn't helping sleep. Another thing they mentioned is that someone on the other side of the world is doing the things you are doing but on their A game. While you are watching them and you are functioning on your B game. Not sure if this helps you guys but it sure motivated me. I also feel way better and I now purchased a planner where I will write down everything I need to do going forward to stay on top of my goals and make sure they are distracting me from this addiction. After you start craving weed again, just imagine that you are climbing a fence and you just need to get over the barbed wire (hardest part). start celebrating how far you have all come.",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.55527806}"

I've been using cannabis everyday for 3 years now, i'd say i'm addicted and i'm trying hard to quit.  
The last year I became very isolated and smoked most time alone or with my brother, because I became severe anxious around people (even good friends) and i haven't seen them in a wile. Ill explain why... I do get really paranoid and anxious when I smoke (not always but a lot of the time) and I become really introverted and ultra aware of myself. I also experienced a lot of derealisation and it was REALLY scary, so I didn't really know what was happening and had to go home every single time I smoke with my friends feeling really exhausted. I knew this isn't right, but still I wanted to smoke. So I started doing it alone. 

My question ; could it be my brain became anxious as a result from being very paranoid so many times? Does the mind know the difference between ""stoned anxiety"" and real anxiety?

I've always been a little shy and anxious, but now I barely leave my room and try as hard as i can to avoid social stuff. I now have severe social anxiety.

ps. i know it's stupid to keep smoking, the addiction is real.

2021-03-02 13:27:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lw8ylo/90_day_challenge/,90 Day Challenge,"Hello Everyone!

Great to be back in this sub after a few month hiatus. I have been smoking weed for the past 9 or 10 years on and off with times of very frequent usage, and also times where the usage was much less. Throughout the past summer I had stopped smoking for a few weeks when I had been applying for a couple different jobs where I assumed there may be drug tests. The last successful streak I had, I think lasted about 17 days at some point in October. I live in Northern New England (USA) and the winter weather has really picked up over the last few months with a lot of snow, as well as freezing cold temperatures. This has mostly kept me inside (at least that is my excuse), and what may have caused me to relapse back to daily smoking after my brief 17 day sober stint. Short but sweet, something I am still proud of which I think will help me throughout this challenge.

I decided last night while laying in bed that it is probably as good a time as ever to attempt a quit again. I've decided to create a ""90 Day Challenge"" for myself that will hopefully put me off from weed for good when it is all said and done. 86 days ago I quit vaping (Juul) and nicotine all together and haven't looked back. I think I will be a lot happier with myself over the course of the next 90 days after I stick to this challenge. If I can give up the all day long nicotine addiction, surely I can go 90 days without weed right?!

A huge issue for me when for me when smoking weed is the fact that it just makes me happy with doing nothing. The high is ultimate complacency. I am a goal oriented person and when I am not smoking I am always trying to grow and improve myself. I am also starting a new job in the next few weeks and am aiming to really impress the company with what I am hoping to accomplish. The sharper and clearer I am the better I will perform.

I have also gained a pretty significant amount of weight over the last few months due to the way that I eat when I am high. It feels like I lose all control. Now that Spring is on the way and I intend to spend a lot of time out in the sun this Summer it's best to give this another solid try. I really want to be happy with myself and in my own skin which is not a feeling I have felt during any recent Summer that I can remember. I think I will be surprised to see how much my body will change throughout this challenge as well. Once I cut out all of the beers I have been drinking along with the late-nightly munchies that I can just never beat.

I really decided to create this post to help keep myself accountable, and as a place to drop in and leave my thoughts when I am inevitably struggling with the challenge. I am closet smoker as I am sure many of you are/were.

Anyone who wants to jump onboard for the challenge with me, feel free! Here are the rules I am setting for myself which I think will yield some great results, just in time for the beginning of Summer as we roll into June.

**90 Day Challenge Rules:**

\- No weed.

\- No alcohol on week nights, only allowing myself to drink on Fridays and Saturdays.

\- Some form of daily exercise whether it is hitting the gym for weights, cardio, or just a walk around the neighborhood.

\- Practice intentional eating.

March 2nd - May 31st. Today is day 1!

I am seriously impressed with the insight of every single last one of you people. make no mistake, weed dependence may not be as serious as other things but for me it has really fed into my depression, hindered my progress in many areas of life, and rendered me utterly reliant. or at least, that's how it feels, but I know that I don't really need it.

 I'm only a few days in and though it may be easy for some people, it is very difficult for me because of the way I used it to cope with multiple mental illnesses. I completely lost my personality and just became a ""stoner"" for like 2-3 years straight. I used to come off as a much smarter person, but now, all people see is my stoner persona, which I have come to realize is not me. merely a mask I constructed to bury my neurotic personality. but that personality is still under the surface, waiting to reappear whenever I am not blazed. unless i intend to live the rest of my life a zombie, I have to stop so that I can work on that neuroticism.

I'm tired of being unable to deal with reality, tired of knowing I have a problem and doing nothing about it. I'm tired of feeling legitimately miserable and pretending that a joint is going to do jackshit to fix that. tired of making decisions high. tired of always being the highest, drunkest person in the room at any social gathering. tired of making a fool of myself. tired of looking dumb, hell, of leaning into that and playing the part, because it's easier to just be dumb than to be fallible.

I have to learn how to enjoy life, and also how to cope with it when it isn't enjoyable. I almost smoked this morning after a night of no sleep (I used to smoke before bed even though it really didn't help, just was kind of a placebo..but still now dealing with insomnia). I came here instead, was struck with the fighting spirit you guys have, and the craving went away. cheers.
