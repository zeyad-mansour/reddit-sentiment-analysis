THIS IS JUST ME VENTING CAUSE I DONT KNOW WHO TO TELL RIGHT NOW. I KNOW I NEED TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS STUFF. JUST NEED TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO WORD IT TO HER.

&#x200B;

My mother does not fully understand that i don't want to be a slave to weed anymore. She laid the offer down a while back saying ""if you really cant fight the cravings then tell me so i can get you some weed.""

which when i broke the news to her during a withdrawal that im addicted and want to stop it was to help me, but instead she first assumed i was laced. I was not. never have been. I get why she thinks that cause it was mainly carts and she is from a different generation but even with flower i still react with a withdrawal if i binge.

She threatened multiple times that if she finds out i smoke carts she will beat my ass. I know she loves me and i love her, but hearing that does not scare me, it angers me. she knows about my past & the physical trauma from bullying. She is just trying to find ways to scare me as a way to help. Which wont work. i still relapsed after that eventually. she does not understand addiction. I dont know if she subconsciously tries not to since my dad struggled with multiple substances and passed from a overdose couple years back.

&#x200B;

Another thing is I can get normal flower, not the carts and if she catches me high she just will ask if it carts or flower. I easily can say weed and she wont get mad at me. she wont scream. just cus she does not want to be a hypocrite. im not saying that will help but it is better than normalizing it just cause you dont want to be a hypocrite. 

last thing is there has been several times where i bring up sending myself away if i keep fucking up and she gets really against that. i brang it up earlier today and she said you cant do that. obviously i can, she has even threatened to send me away herself before. other times i mentioned it she wouldnt say much or will bring up therapy. I get that she will miss me but this is to grow, to not be a slave. TO NOT END UP LIKE MY DAD

not saying im sending myself away but its a option.",3

Now I‚Äôm free and not falling back in!,"Hi everyone, So 27 years living in a weed trap and could not figure away out of it. Living the same loop knowing this problem with MJ is a chain for life and the only way is to break a link.

We all know we have to change our mindset to make a solid change. The mind is a deep mysterious place and we can truly change it if we want to & know how. So, when we just keep toking and don‚Äôt actually stop, even though we say or plan to soooooo many times. This is the conscious mind at work. 

So here‚Äôs the üîë... CBT -Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. And I don‚Äôt mean going to therapy. I am speaking of a specific type of CBT. VISUALIZATION- I will break it down a bit. It takes very little time to do and is one of the most powerful CBT techniques there is. So what I did and it made a core change within me. **Here is what to do: makes some notes on exactly the person you want to become, how you will look, feel, be, do, etc. Create the image of the best version of yourself that you want to become. Then everyday as often as you would like. Get in a quite place alone so you can focus. And literally think, see, feel and be in that person you created in your mind using all of your senses and emotions. Do this process multiple times a day for 5-15 minute intervals. Stay consistent. You will be ü§Ø. What should happen is in roughly 3 weeks, give or take, pending your consistency, you will just wake up one day and have this urgency to be in that person you‚Äôve been visualizing. Neurologically what‚Äôs happening is your going into the back door of your subconscious/non conscious mind and rewriting your self image, so to speak. It for me was like magic. I started this process about a month ago, and no kidding around, it just hit me in a way that the conscious mind can hardly believe. It flipped the switch, I could not seem to do for myself consciously. Today makes 2 days sober. keep in mind other factors can keep this from working.. like lack of belief it works, not being consistent, distractions while visualizing by others or you straying off of conscious thought. No promises it will work, but it had a miraculous affect for me.

Your self image is the foundation for a solid person. Eliminate all excessive intrusive intrinsic thoughts, that are negative and keeping you thinking you are crap. They only reinforce disempowering thinking and keep you stuck in the old you. I hope this serves someone, somewhere. It is the key for the trap door. But you will need to grow and or do more to keep from falling back in. Believe in yourself and you can do anything you put your mind to. 
Much love to all of you struggling to find your true self!  JB",448

I‚Äôm really into hiking and started tackling the 48-4,000 foot mountains in New Hampshire over the summer.

I had a good time hiking and foliage was beautiful.. but the hope I had to come back refreshed after my trip did not happen. As soon as I crossed back into Massachusetts, a black cloud followed me home. 
I have been so depressed these past 2 days, I feel so hopeless and that my life is a joke. I‚Äôm super stressed out because I‚Äôm also studying for a big test in 2 weeks that would be the beginnings of a new career in real estate. I also had a breakup about a month ago on my birthday, and I‚Äôm still sad over that because he ghosted me.

Now that I quit all of a sudden I found myself just not connecting with anybody the same, I just couldn‚Äôt vibe with some of them, and I slowly started drifting away from my friend group but there wasn‚Äôt any animosity. 

I start to notice that I‚Äôm being invited less, not really included as much, and so I tell one of my friends that I‚Äôm going to take a break from people. In that time frame they plan a trip a whole vacation trip that I wasn‚Äôt told about, and that‚Äôs where I kind thought to myself like ‚Äúthese people don‚Äôt really care about me or value me.‚Äù

I‚Äôve quit smoking weed and although I‚Äôve become more assertive, I started to train boxing 3 times a week, I run 3 miles or I workout on my off days, and I‚Äôm generally doing more for myself, it seems like I lost most of my friends that I hangout with. I have a job and my goal is to save up to study abroad now, and I just feel focused right now and with the tension and stress that I used to smoke away, I try to channel that into other things,

I still talk to a couple of people from this group over Snapchat, and still talk to other people through social media, but these were the people who I hungout with. To plan the trip without me and not tell me anything was just a punch in the gut. I think I was the only one who didn‚Äôt know about it, and that shit just hurt.

I can‚Äôt believe that all it took was for me to stop smoking weed and suddenly my ‚Äúhomies‚Äù just fade away. I don‚Äôt plan to confront any of them about it and I‚Äôm probably just gonna decline an invitation (if I ever get actually get invited to do something again), and just not hangout with them again.

I don‚Äôt feel that lonely since I have the boxing gym and at work I‚Äôm around people too, but when I was in highschool I didn‚Äôt really have friends and for this to seemingly happen again is kind of scary, and I‚Äôm just scared to be that guy again.",3

After about two years of constant intake, from wake up to my head hitting the pillow at night, I am now finally taking the steps to drop it altogether. I'm on day 8 of cannabis-free life and the past week has been absolute hell. I no longer drink, or smoke cigarettes so I'm finding it difficult to process my daily stressors in life without the cannabis crutch, and the anxiety and stress have been making the withdrawal symptoms that much worse. Eating has been nauseating for the entire time, each morning is like climbing over the great wall to choke down food, night sweats and shakes have left me sleep deprived and irritable. I have been trying to workout consistently (30 minutes a day of rowing) to overcome and sweat out the bad, but with my lower calorie in-takes I worry I'm overexerting myself even though it seems to be the only thing that makes me feel better.

I quit last week Thursday! I guess that makes 5 days. In my past attempts to quit, I noticed that being sober made me much less productive.

It all started exactly 4 years ago. I was sitting in a garden with 2 friends and one pulled out some weed and rolled a joint.

At that time, i just turned 18. I\`ve smoked my first joint at age 15, but I only did it once and never touched it or even thought of it again. back then I didnt even feel stoned or anything like that, probably because I didnt even know how to smoke properly.

 until that night in september 2016. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, the friend sparked the joint and passed it to me.  I hit it hard, around 2 or 3 times and passed the joint. after about a minute, I started to really freak out. I was hearing everything louder and everything seemed funny. I started laughing uncontrollably and started to dance and jump around.

This lasted for around 5 to 10 minutes. By then we had smoked the Joint and we had a pretty nice evening. But I remember very clearly, that when I was noticing the effects of cannabis on my body and mind for the first time, I thought that cannabis might not be for me.

I had a flood of thoughts rushing into my mind, and was fidgeting the whole time.

it seemed like I couldnt controll my thoughts, and as time went on that night I got very weird thoughts.

But still, I felt that I should smoke Cannabis. I dont know why I didnt listen to my intuition. I\`ve had problems with overthinking, depression and fear in the past. Also, at that point I had been meditating for around a year. After th Cannabis Use got more frequent(At least Once a week),I noticed that my Meditation Sessions were worse and I didnt feel so relaxed afterwards. 

Maybe its the weed we smoke here ( mostly haze mixed with tobacco), i dont know.

Soo I meet up with these friends on weekends, then during the week and I slowly Developed an Addiction. Smoked with them, smoked with other friends, smoked on parties... But It was all fun and i still managed to have good grades in school

That was towards the end of 2016. May 2017 I graduated from school and in october 2017 I enrolled in University, studying business. I didnt have a particular goal in regards to the subject of my studies. I just thought business was always useful and that I would be fine. I dont know what effect Cannabis had on me at that time.

Fast Forward to September 2020.

Right now, I\`ve only managed to get 30 Credit Points out of 180 Credit Points needed for the bachelor degree. Im in my 6th Semester, other people have usually obtained their bachelor degree by this time. The Reason? I believe the Impact Cannabis has had on me.

In 2017 and 2018 I was smoking regularly, but not everyday and not huge quantities. I took my first tests in february 2018, and passed two out of 4. I wasnt shocked, since I didnt study that much and I told my self that in the following semester I will stop smoking weed and focus on my studys. I could tell that weed might not help in university

Well Summer of 2018 came along and I didnt even pass one test out of 5. I was smoking regularly, more than in 2017, skipping classes, not studying much at home. But you know what? I didnt even care!

e.g. I went into a test and got out of there after 30 min because I didnt know shit. (the test should take 90 min). It didnt bother me, I just laughed it off and smoked a joint afterwards.

I told myself the same shit I told myself the semester before.

I will stop smoking and focus on my Studies.

But I didnt stop, and in February 2019 I took 5 tests and failed all of them.

Again, this is hard to explain, but i really didnt care about that! I never felt bad or nervous about me being in 3rd semester and only having passed 2 test at that point. Right now I Cant believe why I Didnt care and why I didnt change anything!

So I told myself I will stop Smoking, and the next Semester came along and I Smoked more than ever before. That Summer I went to University already stoned and skipped classes.

I smoked so much, that I missed the registration deadline for my exams. That meant that I couldnt take any Exams that semester. Basically the same as failing all exams.

That was in August 2019. I told myself that I had to stop and I really have to get going. 

Well that lasted around 1 month. Then a buddy of mine enrolled in University, and he was selling weed. 

everyday we met at University and smoked joint after joint.

Sometimes up to 5G a day. needless to say i didnt study and didnt take it seriously.

We smoked from September up to January. Everyday, monday to friday.

In the back of my mind I knew that this was wrong, and I Should focus on University.

But I didnt have this urgent and pressing feeling, one should have when he has failed his last 4 semesters. I think It was because of the weed, making me feel numb and detached.

Needles to say, I took 4 exams and failed them all. In one exam, i went in stoned and laughed my ass of, not even bringing a calculator with me and leaving after 10 minutes. Today I cant tell you how and why I Did that!!

Then Corona came along, and I thought maybe throughout this quarantine I can stay sober and really focus on my studies. But I Didnt. 

I really focused more on my Studies, but at the same time I also smoked more weed than ever before.

I took 6 tests and passed 4, but I think that doesnt mean shit. Im 22 , going into my 7th semester and only managed to get 30 out of 180 Credit Points. What perspective do I have? How do I explain this to future bosses or to my family?

From September 2019 to September 2020 I smoked everyday. Longest break in this period was 1 week.

I feel lost and scared.

Dont know what the future holds for me. I dont know where these 3 years went. I feel I took 10 steps back.

And I still like Weed. I dont know how I can still like weed, it made me do terrible things, for e.g.

Stealing money from my father and mother ( for buying weed) and Not even admitting it when aksed about it.

Lying to my family on a daily basis.

Lying to my father and mother regarding my studies and drug use.

picking up joints from the street to smoke them.

Throwing away papers, grinders ( ""Im gonna stop now"") Only to search through the trash the next day.

Throwing away a potential degree and a good job.

How Can I still Like something that has done so much damage?

&#x200B;

I dont know guys. Sorry if this text seems a bit cloudy. I cant even find all the words to describe what a piece of shit I have been the past 3 years. My memory is cloudy and I cant even recall many events, its horrifying if i even try to think about it. I Feel like I wasnt in Charge for the past 3 years.

Still smoking at the moment. But mostly in order to not feel withdrawals like sleeplessness and irritation.

I dont know where my life is going and what to do with me. Im Scared looking into my future.

&#x200B;

Thanks to everyone taking their time. Hope you can give me some advice.",2

I' live in the Netherlands (Holland) and weed is actually legal in NL. I started smoking weed about 4 years ago and since then have (almost) never stopped for a longer period of time. 2 years back my drug use took a drastic turn and I started to smoke almost every day. I'm now at the point where I smoke about a gram of hash a day. Last year I had a few anxiety/panic attacks (presumably by my drug abuse) I failed almost all my classes and I felt really bad for a couple months. I didn't hang out with friends, didn't work, didn't study, my life basically came to a stop.

I've tried quitting about 20 times now, just in the last year. Some attempts lasted a week, some lasted a month, others didn't even really took off. I really want to quit because I know how good the benefits are of not smoking and how good it actually feels to not be addicted.

I am now at the point that I want to quit but I can't even start. Every morning when I wake up with my mind blurry and hazy from smoking the previous night, I am confident: this will be the day I quit. But in the evening I get this massive urge to smoke and I relapse in old behavior. Even if I'm twice as motivated to quit smoking the morning after, 99% of the time I'm back where I started in the evening. 

I live next to a ""coffeeshop"" where you can buy weed egally, so, if I have the urge to smoke weed I am able to buy a gram of weed in about 30 seconds. 

I am kinda desperate now, I really want to quit, and tried a lot of different stuff. I am aware of the fact that the first couple of days are the hardest (went through this myself). But for some reason I can't start quitting. If you have any tips or ideas please comment.

It feels really good to get this out here, I've never actually told anyone about how addicted I really am and can see there is a lot of likeminded souls who went through a comparable situation. Thank you so much for reading my story.",3

So I was chatting with a dealer, and I notice that I'm very anxious about buying weed. Like yeah it'd be nice have some (according to my addiction at least), but I felt so freaking anxious about checking the messages or thinking about going to buy some.

This is when I realised it is not worth it. I have felt anxious so many times, and a voice of reason is always there, however quiet, saying: ""I don't really want to buy weed and waste my money and health again"" and then I would ignore the anxious feelings and that wise part of me and buy some--only to be in the same situation once again in like 3-5 days.

 ""I'll just buy this last time and stop. I'll even throw away or sell the weed if it doesn't feel good."" says the addiction. And that never happens btw, however in despair I would be, I would never throw away the weed.

I guess I'm starting to realise that this groundhogs day could go on forever, and the only rational and plausible way right now is to quit this lifestyle. I don't even have energy or motivation to make food for myself and eat at times, and I feel dread over so many things. I haven't gone to the gym because I'm high all the time and too lazy to go.

I think it's time for change, it is unbearable for me to carry on this way.

Today I was visiting a psychotherapist and he said I need to be 2 months sober before we can start a long-term therapy. Of course I could lie about not smoking, but I think he is right... Therapy is much more effective if I'm not using substances at the time. So that's another reason for me to quit, apart from: lethargy, relationships, work/school, motivation, wellbeing and many more.

Wish me luck guys, and I hope you are doing well :)",6

Today I woke up from a mid day nap after smoking and woke up confused and lost in my own room. I woke up from the nap and felt as if I had come back to myself. I realized this isn't what i want to be doing. I'm behind on school work and have isolated myself from my family and friends. I feel like a loser that wants to do nothing but smoke. I keep using weed to run from my problems that I don't really have. I want to stop using and need to before i compromise my studies.

I had been a once a year smoker that on a random night with friends would smoke but during April 2020 i decided to get into it but stopped after a week or every other day use. Then in July 2020 i started using it daily for almost 2 months until i tried stopping again but was met with utterly long and painful withdrawals. I pushed through them and was off weed for about 3 weeks until i went out with my ""friends"" again and one of them had a joint and a vape. He let me hit both and i was back. Back to going around lying to family about where i go at random times. Back to wasting all my day while my grades take a plummet. Back to wasting my savings that i had worked so hard to get. And back to living a way that would put my mother to shame. I keep asking myself ""How could you be doing this while your mom works her butt off?"".

No more i don't want to be trapped in this. That's how i feel, trapped into this. I know i am not a long time smoker like others but there have been times when i was high that i would see and feel myself smoking without knowing how i got there or why i was doing it when i don't need it.

 I want to be healthier. I want to be in a conversation and know what I'm saying. I need to stop lying. I will learn to live normally again. 

I'm not going to lie I am worried about facing the withdrawals again. Last time i tried quitting after daily use i got very very sick. Any tips or advice for relieving withdrawal symptoms(especially irritability and depression) or cravings? Thanks.",2

So unfortunately I have to take some time off to let it heal.  I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do with my time that i found my one escape from smoking.  Anyone have any ideas on other things that i could do to pass the free time.  

I recently started hanging out with people that i have never spoken to before.  I was very nervous to hangout with this girl but it turned out to be really chill and had a good time.  Weed made my mind fog over and really just hated people or interactions with people.  Still having issues with my roommates but that is not meant for this sub.

For the people that just started their journey, i know that shit sucks right now and sleep is hard and your mind is constantly thinking about smoking, but filling your time that you would be smoking with things you don‚Äôt do or even thought of doing really helps.

I've been a habitual smoker since my teen years with few breaks in between.  usually only for probation or not being able to get any.  Fast forward to a job that basically let me have as much weed as I want and I had been smoking anywhere from a gram to a quad a day for 3 years.  I have EDS (a condition resulting in chronic pain and just general poor quality of life) and marijuana has been my crutch to stay away from opiates....and honestly it works great, but I also realize the negatives it has on my life.

Now I started college this semester and after a couple weeks in I decided to quit.  I had been weaning myself down to about half a gram a day, but since I have a volcano hybrid it was still getting me ridiculously high some days, and that was when I decided to take a break from it, on one hand to help me study, and on the other to work towards getting a better job at the local hospital.  The first 3 days were awful.  Just hell.  and after that its gotten better.  I'm just now at 3 weeks, and because I got a call back from the hospital right away, didn't have time to get 100% clean.  I figured the best thing to do would be to grab my medical card so in case I pee dirty I can still work there, and now I'm in possession of a medical card...which worries me that I might slip back into abusing it.

I've completely upended my diet, eating far more veggies and staying away from soda and carbs and have lost some weight and feel GREAT.  My test scores have stayed the same so has my general performance in life, but on the other hand I'm noticing that the chronic pain days are taking its toll once again.  Somedays I hurt...so much.  I know my condition is real, but I also know I smoke for more than just pain and the anguish that comes with chronic illness.  I love the clarity, but I need the pain relief and now that I have my medical card, I feel like I'm just going to fall right back in again using it as an excuse.  I want to smoke, but know that I should just tough it out and ignore it, but some days...the really bad days...I just want to vape a little when I get home and feel the aches melt away, especially with how hard and active I am now with part time school and a full time job.

Is it okay to vape a little bit for relief?  or should I continue this journey?  The idea of even trying it again to see how it effects me worries me because I don't want to get sucked back in again, and I came to reddit to seek advice and reading all the posts on here make me feel like a failure for considering it , even though I know this isn't this subs intention.  Is it possible to find a balance with my addictive personality?  Or have I finally grown up enough to where I can moderate effectively?  

I don't know.",1

Yay... if only these what I assume ‚Äúwithdrawal‚Äù symptoms would disappear I‚Äôd be happier.

I‚Äôve smoked weed for 10 yrs and vaped nic for 1 year. 
So far I‚Äôve experienced a range of symptoms but a few are lasting longer than others and are more of an annoyance to me that I‚Äôd wish would go away.

I still feel bubbling in my lower right abdomen just above my hip bone, it isn‚Äôt as serve as the beginning of this month or like it was in August but it‚Äôs still there and noticeable. Waiting on stool sample currently. Have had x Ray, ultrasound, bloodwork and EGK done and all looked good on that front. 

In the last two weeks I‚Äôve developed this dull ache in my right knee but no reduce motion or much pain just more annoyance to my daily life; really notice it when I‚Äôm sitting at computer and laying down in bed, go figure another thing to feel while laying in bed with my stomach bubbles. Been trying to use muscle relaxer on it but not much help. Idk if this is a withdrawal symptom or not? I know it‚Äôs not from a injury or anything like that, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs cause weed is anti inflammatory?? 

The last three days I‚Äôve been getting headaches usually coming on in the afternoon/eveningish but I‚Äôve been sleeping them off so far. 

Every once in awhile I‚Äôll wake up with what feels like fluid on my chest but might be anxiety? Hard to describe the feeling but doesn‚Äôt really bother me just kinda weird and since they didn‚Äôt see anything on chest X-ray I assume it‚Äôs nothing but maybe anxiety causing it.

Really hoping that in the end all these symptoms are really just from withdrawals of being a long time smoker and nothing crazy serious. Hoping that these symptoms will go away sooner than later as time passes.

I appreciate everyone who post on this sub as it helps knowing others going thru similar situation and eases my anxiety of this whole thing. Here‚Äôs hoping that all goes away soon enough.",2

I have attempted to quit multiple times, but this is the first time it‚Äôs sticking. I‚Äôve also been a non-smoker for a year and a half (with a slip up of four cigarettes three weeks ago). 

I am holding a job for the first time in six years, and I may be getting a promotion.  I bought a new car, and my life is becoming more stable. I started walking every day again, and I‚Äôm attempting to get my eating in control. 

Everything is going fine, except that I feel this intense emptiness and dissatisfaction with life. I feel unhappy and I can‚Äôt believe this is what I get to look forward to. 

I feel lonely and my body image issues are really taking a toll on my happiness. Attractiveness isn‚Äôt everything, but it feels that way. 

I keep thinking of how I will never be able to escape again, and this impending doom takes over. It reminds me of when I was depressed and suicidal, and what a horrible feeling that is. I have had a crippling depression twice in my life, chronic depression for 16 years, and a bout of possible mania a year ago. Getting hospitalized last year made it really clear that I needed to take control of my life. I will end up in the hospital again if I continue to get high.

I am trying to get better to change my life, and prevent another suicidal depression, but I can‚Äôt say for certain it won‚Äôt come back. I have accepted that I can‚Äôt get high anymore, but it leaves me thinking of how I will cope with another crisis in my life. 

I‚Äôve said it quite a few times that should I ever get that depressed again, I will attempt suicide. I can‚Äôt handle another depressive episode, especially when I have trouble making it through my good days (at times). 

I‚Äôve been having good days because of the novelty and newness of being sober, but that doesn‚Äôt take away all of the issues in my life that have been building up. I feel an intense emptiness at times, and I just don‚Äôt know if I can handle feeling this way forever. Sometimes I just want to get off this rollercoaster called life and be at a peace.",4

I don‚Äôt want to.,"It‚Äôs a hard thing for me to chose and I strongly dislike that I have to chose. I am 21 about to turn 22 in a month. Have been smoking daily for about 3 years now. Today however, is a different day than the rest. Today morning my mother knocks on my door and asks to come in; I said it‚Äôs okay to come in. She‚Äôs crying and sobbing and immediately I asked ‚ÄúWhat happened‚Äù? She goes on to apologize right after and asking me for forgiveness as to what she‚Äôs about to do. My mother proceeded to tell me she‚Äôs leaving the family because she can no longer withstand out current living situation and said she feels drained. I love my mother more than anything and she explained that whenever she would see me come in the house high (I have a great relationship with my mom and I told her I smoked weed a couple years ago) she felt sad and disappointed in herself because she didn‚Äôt raise me to smoke and said I didn‚Äôt need that stuff. I love weed, I love to smoke, but I also love my mom. For the past year I have been hurting my mother by smoking and her seeing me in that state hurt her each and every time and I didn‚Äôt even notice. Maybe I did but was so selfish I didn‚Äôt give a damn. I really don‚Äôt want to quit because I love to smoke; smoking has literally brought the best friends in my life to date. Like Uncle Iroh from Avatar said ‚ÄúSharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life‚Äôs true delights‚Äù. I feel the same way. Sharing a joint, bong, bowl, GB, Dab, whatever, is one of my favorite things to do. Having those sessions with your friends and having deep thought conversations that lead to ideas and experiences. I‚Äôm sad because I feel like I have to let go one of the things that TRULY brings me joy. My mother came back hours later because she said she just couldn‚Äôt find it in herself to leave us. The reason I‚Äôm quitting is because I hurt my mother with my own selfish wants. I am human, I did hurt my mom but I no longer want to hurt her. I know quitting will bring me nothing but positivity but why do I feel sad still? What will I do now? I don‚Äôt want to drink cause fuck that. Is this where people occupy their time with other things to not get bored and smoke? I would greatly appreciate some help in how I should go about quitting the healthy way. Thank you",7

I'm 28 and I've been using for pretty much 10 years. Always knew it was bad for me, changing me, but I couldn't help it. The numbness was all I was wanting. Another thing, it cost me most of my good friends.

I was in a 3 years relationship. She didn't have direct trouble with weed, but I still think that the main reason it's over is because of my consummation that was constant. 14grams a week. 

So now, with the slap in the face, I don't know if I'll ever have that much motivations to stop. I wanna be back to my old self, active and optimist. 

I know that it won't bring her back. That's not the point, I wanna do it for me. 

I threw everything in a trash can away from my now solo appartment this morning. I'm starting to feel anxiety, I'm mostly afraid of a sleepless night. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts, advice, positive words. 
Thanks, I'm so glad that this community exists.",10

I‚Äôm not talking about people who use it medically or even once and a while, but for the people who use it multiple times a day, everyday. 

Weed is used too often as an escape, if something bad or unfortunate happens smoking is a way to reduce the pain. The problem I‚Äôve noticed is it‚Äôs good to feel the pain, because that‚Äôs what motivates you to do better. Smoking chronically essentially makes you feel great about doing bad things, cause it mutes the feelings of despair. You‚Äôre meant to feel those feelings, it‚Äôs not a bad thing, It‚Äôs a wakeup call. 

I‚Äôm 11 days sober right now for the first time in over  2 years and I‚Äôve gotten such a rush of motivation now. I feel like my old self again(despite still going through the withdrawal phase). 

I encourage everyone to not look at where they were, but to look at what they can become. Cause getting that new job, hitting a new PR on the benchpress, spending more time with your family is so much more fulfilling and important then ripping that new bong you just blew $300 on. 

Keep your head high, not your brain. I wish all of you the best of luck in achieving your goals. Cheers to a better tomorrow.",38

Day 1 & my first real attempt to get my life back.,"Hi everyone, first time using Reddit. I am a 27 year daily Cannabis smoker. I am 45 year old male from the south, USA. Married with 5 kids, well young adults. Youngest 16 / oldest 22 & all have been so awesome and near perfect throughout the years. I can still remember we had 4 in diapers at one point of our lives. Now that‚Äôs a lot of crap.  I have held the same professional job/business since I was 15. I have been a habitual Cannabis user since age 18. If I did the math right that‚Äôs 27 years of my mind & life hijacked by the plant. 

Started with swag then on to KB. I progressed through the cycle as it seems most that become dependent do. To the point of everyday habitual use. I use pretty much any chance I can do so and get away with it. I don‚Äôt worry about looking high. B/c I don‚Äôt look, feel, or believe I get high anymore. Hell I earned my Blue Belt w/2 stripes in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu stoned and I did very well. Very complex, mentally & physically challenging. You have to learn it mentally and physically then practice / learn and be able to apply what you know while under a lot of pressure & stress. Lots of blood, sweat, & tears. You can‚Äôt find a more effective martial art and active meditation type activity. 
       
I have a deep need to know, see, and be the other person in me I want to become. Today marks DAY1 of sobriety. I am saddened by the years lost to the numbing mind, that I don‚Äôt have any emotions attached to my memories. I have only tried quitting once in my life- for one day around 6 years ago. But rage, depression,  fear & the PAWS brought me right back. In the 27 years, I can literally count the days I‚Äôve had sober on one hand. I know this is sickening, I see it to. I am not proud, but ashamed. 
      
Let me back up and it can help show some of the reasons I think I used it for so long. Raised with dysfunction & mental grief but we were full. I had four lil brothers and a older sister. I lost my dear brother and friend when he was 19. I was 21. Horrible car accident. Then some more years of traumatic events. Then my beautiful sister age 28 dies of the worlds rarest cancer known. I was 26. Only one other person in the world shared that strain and even it was not exactly the same. Then some time passes and my littlest brother gets hooked on Oxy/pain meds/ Then heroin. It was a 13 year stent of him abusing & and robbing my aging parents to the point of Bankruptcy. My father is a Doctor and he did quite well, however there is nothing left to show. All the times calling the cops and threatening to end my brother and myself & to no avail he just wouldn‚Äôt stop. Finally a year ago he saw how broken everyone in the family was he just finally checked into rehab and got clean. Everyday my other two brothers and I would just smoke the day away to relieve all the tension. 13 year nightmare finally over. 

Now it seems my life is calmed down enough to do something bout my drug addiction to pot. I never looked at it as a addiction b/c it fit into life and no one really knew about the extent of it. Lots of hiding and burning. I would work from home and smoke whenever I felt like it. It‚Äôs almost as if pot became my everything, everyday, everywhere. Totally need to recalibrate my reward system. 

I did not set a quit date, as I never went through with any. Guess it was from the anxiety of saying no to it forever. The other day I just said it‚Äôs time now. And through out my collections of smokable tools per say. Even busted my scale. I know somehow this is just it for me. I do expect to get hit hard with PAWS & emotional mental anguish. 

I have been studying heavily everyday for a little over two years. I‚Äôve studied neuroscience, quantum physics, psychology, and epigenetic. It is so amazing to see how they all inner twine with each other. I feel it has set me up with some shields against self sabotage or loosing this battle. But the nerves have not kicked in yet like I feel they will. So I will see how armed I am when the sh_t really hits the fan. I am excited about becoming the new man I know I can be. Well that‚Äôs my story and here we go. Thanks for reading. JB",164

In the past couple years I have been having ""random"" pains and assumed it was just from the high. But more recently I have been having some recurring issues which led me to quit smoking. I understand that I will probably need to see a doctor, but I was hoping to hear similar experiences that will let me ride it out and hope to fix itself without wasting time, money, and causing me more frustration with the medical system.

It has been 5 and half weeks since I quit (39 days), and I am still having issues. The main problem is a pain in my front left side near the bottom of my rib cage. It is the main recurrent pain, that happens daily, and seems to be worsened by eating (still trying to figure out what foods exactly cause it). Occasionally, I also have pain in the same area on my side & back. In addition to this, I also experience bloating w/frequent urination and rarely, I have had intense intestinal pain. Since quitting, I have almost never had a solid stool.

Most information I have found says THC should be out of this system in about 30 days. But was hoping to find others that have had similar experiences to mine, where it takes longer. The main possibility/cause of this that I have researched is the endocannabinoid system. I understand that by smoking too much, you can actually damage this system, but again, most things I read says it shouldn't be taking this long to ""reset"" it.

It seems that a lot of people in here are dealing with more than just bumps in the past that they have never dealt with due to use of cannabis. If you have an undiagnosed mental disorder or are suffering from depression or anxiety in general, maybe combined with a very little or non-existing base of friends and familiy, quitting becomes very hard if not impossible to do on your own.

Forgive me that I have copy/pasted my comment to the other post below:

I was diagnosed with ADD (ADHD without the Hyperactivity) 2 years ago which explains why I have loved weed so much. It was self-medication. However, there are some very good drug treatments out there today. I was prescribed the drug Strattera that unlike a drug like Ritalin does not slow you down and is designed to only affect certain neurotransmitters in the frontal lopes - the ones responsible for handling your worries. I remember my dad called them ""the board of directors"" :). If they are not able to sort out irrelevant thoughts and worries (like when you are really tired), then quitting weed becomes really hard. I feel lucky that I have been diagnosed and is already in treatment, makes quitting so much less painful to me.

I strongly recommend everyone with a lifelong abuse of cannabis to seek an psychiatric assessment if they have just the slightest suspecion that they might have a mental disorder or similar that could have ignited their abuse as a form of self-medication.

Please share or comment if you have any thoughts or experience on this subject.",8

I'm reading this sub for almost a year now and wanted to thank everybody for contributing to it. 

I'm smoking for 10years now, started when I was 18. At the beginning it was fun, having this experience with friends. It went downhill when I started to smoke alone and using weed as a way to cope with stress and break ups.
It peaked at New years eve this year, when I found out my ex gf was seeing another man. This and the following quarantine made me smoke a ton of weed as I tried to get rid of my feelings. 

Now I'm sitting here on vacation, 10 days sober with no access to weed. I was looking forward to this vacation so bad, as I knew it would be easier to deal with the no sleep and all the other effects of quitting while being at a beautiful beach.  
I can say that I don't miss weed at all, but I'm afraid of coming back home and falling back into the routine. 

That's why I came up with the following list of reasons why I wanted to quit and to prepare for the moment of coming home.  

I want to sleep well and get up refreshed.
I don't want to cough my lungs out for 10 minutes after getting up in the morning.
I want to go through the day without headaches or dizziness.
I don't want to keep looking for opportunities or excuses to get home early from work to smoke weed alone.
I don't want to put this poison on my body any longer. ‚Äå
I want to cook and eat properly again and stop stuffing junk food into myself. ‚Äå
I don't want to let down friends anymore because I prefer to stay at home and smoke pot.
I want to be spontaneous again and not spend every second of my free time ‚Äåhigh.
I want to meet new people and make a good impression.
I want to get bored and creative again.
I don't want me or my apartment to stink of smoke.
I want to fully taste and enjoy food again. ‚Äå
I want to deal with the struggles in life again and be happy when I have found a solution.
I want to stop wasting time because that is the most valuable currency. ‚Äå
I want to finally get started in my job and develop my full potential.
I want to find a woman with whom I can happily have a relationship, for two. There is no space for addiction in a healthy relationship. 
I want to have fun in life again.
I want to develop plans for the future.

I don't want to be addicted anymore, I want to determine my own life.

Me (22F) and my bf (24M) moved in together about 6 months ago, and he used to be a huge pot head, me not so much. But I would partake in weed at parties and such.

About a month ago, I decided to quit since I got a new job and I wanted to be fully aware all the time (even weekends), instead of being baked out of my mind.

The issue is my bf. He smokes all day after work... when he arrives home, before dinner, before bed etc.

I've told him I want to quit and he is OK with that, but it's so hard not wanting to smoke when he is right there on our backyard, smoking!

I don't want him to quit for me, but I also can't quit while still there's pot in the house.

What do I do? I love him and I don't want to make him change, but he makes it hard to quit.

I've been smoking almost daily for about a decade now. I had quit for a couple months till Covid hit. I want to stop, but the thought of not being able to numb my life at the end of the work day scares me...

I can see that smoking hurts me. What little motivation I have goes away, so I just kind of abandon my life. Now if I'm not stoned I feel the weight of my abandoned life plus the other existential dreads of the times and all that I want is to not feel. Doesn't help I've got the ADHD so everything that's not immediately beneficial is really fucking hard (if not impossible), and is just more work and struggle I want to avoid.

Also doesn't help that my SO is fine with smoking the dread and depression away and keeps us stocked. 


Pretty sure the dread is inescapable. That I'll need to just suffer... Was wondering if you guys had any advice on how to deal with... sober life. All I have besides smoking is videogames, another way to not feel terrible about everything till I'm too tired to think. It's not nice, but it is better than just feeling like existence hurts more than I can handle.",14

I smoked daily for 2 years, couple Js a day. Smoked a half bowl one night and had a crazy anxiety attack. Arm went numb, tongue numb, spinning head, tunnel vision, racing thoughts, huge doom sense. I knew I had to stop smoking then and there. I also dropped nicotine after 3 years.

First week was really tough. Heart palpitations, anxiety Second week appetite, sleep, dreams, and some energy came back. However, I still get heart palpitations, psudo-pains in my heart/chest, empty breaths (like they are ineffective/arent satisfying), dizziness/lightheadedness, and a constant anxiety.

Could the big anxiety attack I had trigger an anxiety that I can now have for the rest of my life? I may just be thinking way too much about everything.

Stopping for just one day was the hardest thing for me as my partner and I both smoke and it was so hard to say no multiple times a day.

I finally managed to quit while visiting my mum for a few weeks. Being here was the safe space I needed to get clean (and even then had a few false starts before finally managing more than a day). I am so damn pleased with myself and feel much better already! However I am due to go back home to my partner this week and am really worried that being around weed 24/7 will cause me to relapse.

I wanted to return home to concentrate on a new job that is starting next week, but as it is remote working I can actually do that from my mum's. I'm now thinking I should just stay put for the time being, but obviously can't avoid my home and partner forever.

My partner is completely supportive of me quitting and I know he will not invite me to smoke. I'd love if he quit (he has indicated that he has thought about it but I don't think he's there yet). I know he needs to make the decision himself and would also feel like a hypocrite if I asked him to stop given that I reintroduced weed to him 4 years ago when we hooked up.

It doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind i just have trigger point in the day where I‚Äôm like i should smoke, oh wait no lets not.  But these only happen during the times when i would smoke before for example; after work, after i get my stuff done for the day, and right before i go to sleep.  In my posts i have been saying sleeping is a lot better, which is true after the 3-4 day but i still have the want or feeling that something is missing.  I have a lot of progress to make before i am fully sober but i like how its going so far.

Second thing is I am finally in touch with my emotions, during all of high school i never had a girlfriend, never kissed anyone, never had sex of course.  But i am finally realizing i need a relationship, I‚Äôm going to get out there and be me, i have had issues with myself saying well no girl talks to me so i guess I‚Äôm just ugly or not worth it.  Turns out my problem was that i never tried to be in a relationship because i just ignored all the women that would try to talk to me... i know that sounds cliche, but i just was never interested in that bc i had never felt it and convinced myself i never did want to feel it.

I‚Äôm 17 and I‚Äôve been smoking consistently for 3 years now. this isn‚Äôt my first time I‚Äôve attempted to go sober wether it was permanently or for ‚Äútolerance breaks‚Äù it never quite lasts longer than a week. I always find myself coming back thinking that I‚Äôll have more self control and I can just be a casual user but it never works. Smoking weed isn‚Äôt enjoyable for me anymore, my tolerance is completely jacked up since I‚Äôm practically high at all hours of the day wether it‚Äôs bud or wax. 

I started smoking as a form of escapism, getting fucked up to block out all that was wrong with my life and how I was feeling, but time went on all it did was give me new problems to work out. As my tolerance grew I smoked more, and more frequently. The past year I‚Äôve noticed a shift from a emotional dependency to a physical one. Whenever I tried to sober up, I would feel like complete shit and my appetite would disappear. This always made me relapse after a days, cause the discomfort just didn‚Äôt feel worth it once the cravings set in.

Today is Day 4 after 17 years smoking.  I washed my car and vacuumed everything up.  You know what I'm talking about: joint butts filling up the tray and ashes coating every surface.  I used make-up wipes to clean the muck out of the little corners.  And I'm so used to the scent of weed, that I'll need to find someone else to tell me what my car smells like right now.

This is going better than my previous attempts.  I know exactly what to expect:  cold sweats, no appetite, shaking, insomnia, anxiety, short temper, emptiness, boredom, less control over my emotions...but the lack of motivation, I think, is the worst part.

I can't motivate myself to work.  I've worked zero billable hours today; so I'm making no money.  I can't even motivate myself to do anything fun.  There's a hot spring that I've been wanting to take myself to, but only high-me can get off my ass to go do it.  Doing stuff alone is hard and requires motivation.  It's easier to just sit at my computer and zone out.

Nothing seems fun to me right now.  I just don't care about anything...just sitting here being conscious.  I'm just alive, no more no less.  It doesn't feel like there's any point to existence.  We're all just here to make money for the government and die.  Everything is an illusion to keep the cogs rolling. 

After washing my car, I took a long nap and wasted time on the internet.  I know it'll get easier...but I'm still convinced the world will be bleak and grey from here on out.  Nothing will give me the flavor of life like weed did.  Nothing will help my loneliness, heart ache, pain, and suffering like weed did.

But don't get me wrong...I have GREAT things I'm looking forward to.  There's a government job that I really want to apply for.  Obviously - no pot heads allowed, so I probably won't get it.  But I gotta try before I get too old, or I know I'll regret it.  Aside from marriage & making a family (which I can't control, cause men are men), I know a government job is the next best thing for me.  I would get energized and excited thinking about it: doing research, reading, making notes, exercising, making my body strong, trying to figure out self-discipline, learning new skills, and bettering myself in anyway possible for it.  **But now that I'm sober, I.JUST.DON'T.CARE.** I know I won't get the job, and I'm only setting myself up for disappointment.

Most days  I would smoke morning, noon, and especially night.  No matter what I wouldn't miss a day.

I had horrible withdrawal symptoms for the first few days, cold sweats at night and tons of nausea.  I also had the worst case of insomnia of my entire life for the first 6 days.  Lastnight was my first full night of sleep since I quit.  

I woke up today feeling somewhat normal, I even made love to my gf this morning for the first time since I quit.  Man losing my sex drive for those first days about killed me.  My body felt so out of whack.

I know I'm only going into week 2, but this is huge for me.  Today I was able to keep down food, other days it was usually violent vomiting when I'd eat.  Most food doesn't appeal to me, but beef jerky does, as well as Salmon, and strawberry smoothies.  Smoothies were even recommended to me by one of you wonderful people!  After throwing up all my dinner lastnight I tried just a strawberry smoothie and was able to keep that down. 

I spent around 32,500 on weed over the last decade, in the end I was buying an ounce of dabs for 450 that would last around 2 months.

Well now i am taking all that money I'd usually spend on weed and saving it up to buy a very nice Korg keyboard.  I have been playing music and Mario on Switch to help myself with cravings and have healthy outlets.  

For once in my adult life I feel like I am starting to get my shit together and become a real man.  I am proud of myself.  Sure it's been hard.  Vomiting, not sleeping, having no sex drive was all very hard, but I kept pushing through.  I even had real life hallucinations for two nights solid, where I was so sleep deprived I'd see things in reality that should only be found in my dreams.

If I can do it so can you.  Be honest with the one's around you, open up with them about how hard it is to quit.  Understand that pain and discomfort in the moment lead to true growth when you tell yourself ""I'm better than this, I'm gonna power through it without the weed."" And stick to that mindset.

I couldn't have gotten this far if I wasn't open with the one's I love and with some of you here on this sub.

Feel free to message me any time you want and I will return all the love and support that I can.  Thank you all for being here. 

Remember we're all in this together and we will become better people by letting go of a toxic relationship we have with this plant.

My question is: Has anyone else endured this? If so, when you stopped smoking did it help or worsen? 

I can honestly say that I have an addiction to marijuana. So I guess that‚Äôs the first step. Any advice would help and be greatly appreciated. :)",7

Well for me is not dealing with disconnection from being, part of me says I am not important I am not enough, weed made me feel better without the hang ups from my narcissistic family.  The last 6 days I have been on a road trip, it has been easier to do since weed is not really out in UTAH, and I love it here Coming from California. It is getting easier just on my 3 day without THC going into my body, the first three I was having lots o night sweats, or during the day like hot flashes is the most uncomfortable but being somewhere or driving around looking at the foliage change I have found a different perspective on the addiction! I feel I am growing to be the best person of myself and it is overwhelming ,eager to learn how To approach my well being. I have been listening to podcasts and it is like a switch now, I feel weed helped me realize feelings I didn‚Äôt want to confront because past abuse and neglect from narcissistic parent, my twin 57 yo has the same problem but she doesn‚Äôt smoke she is just stuck not being her, not strong enough to love herself and fog through abuse from her kids and aging parent that will never realized they didn‚Äôt do it right or accept the harm they gave us.

Do I sound crazy.?   why do you people smoke? Why do you really like to get high? The real reason or answer is .....ask that to yourself be honest, this helped me realized Im Old enough to love myself and stop abusing it. And this is where I find myself today.

I‚Äôm 104 days sober. I‚Äôm thankful every day for this gift. And for the most part, I tell myself that I‚Äôm getting over things. That I don‚Äôt need it. I have my own apartment, I have good friends, a good support network. For the first time in my life I‚Äôve been able to truly address my mental health issues without using unhealthy coping mechanisms. But today, I started spiralling. I allowed myself to sit in this dark headspace where I didn‚Äôt believe that I deserve what I have, that things are just going to get worse. The way covid has changed the world has changed me, despite the progress that I‚Äôve made. There is this fear inside of me, I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll ever be able to shake it. I still haven‚Äôt been able to get myself to find a job and return to work. It terrifies me. So I thought about using. I thought about going to the dispensary, picking up, rolling a joint, and fading away from the world. Falling into the fog again made sense for a little while. And then I realized if I did that, it would only set me back. I had a dark day. But is that worth throwing away everything that I‚Äôve done to make it over 100 days sober? The longest that I‚Äôve been clean in 8 years? Is it worth spending the money that I need to buy groceries, and pay my bills, just to not feel anything for a fraction of the time it‚Äôs taken me to get here? If I‚Äôve learned anything, it‚Äôs that there won‚Äôt always be good days. Life isn‚Äôt supposed to be rainbows and unicorns all day, every day. There are going to be shadows and demons sometimes. It‚Äôs about how I choose to deal with it though. Getting high isn‚Äôt dealing with it, it‚Äôs simply delaying the inevitable pain. I‚Äôm stronger than my urges. I‚Äôm doing the very best thing that I can by feeling the emotions and hoping to wake up in the morning even a little better than the day before. I‚Äôm going to drink some tea, and listen to a podcast, and try to get some sleep. Those are the things that will get me through. Practicing my DBT skills, weighing the pros and cons. I‚Äôm proud of myself for not going to the dispensary. I thought about using, but it was only a thought. I had to ride the wave, and I made it to shore.",27

Out of the 4, only two of us smoked weed and I saw a very different aspect of my bestie. He along with the other non smoker were behaving holier than thou and I could feel the judgement they were passing every single moment. We sat back in the car and I had gone on a BT thinking about all this. I realised the 4th non smoker was accomplishing bigger things than all of us and both the other guys were tail wagging him the entire time. What had hurt me was that the guy who I called my best friend was dragging me down like he knew both me and my friend are high and he went ‚Äúyou want to smoke another?‚Äù in a demeaning tone. And when we were in our car he went to my friend like ‚Äúyou have gone stupid by being high, shut up‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt understand this behaviour and I woke up with such a heavy head as I had quit weed a week back and yesterday was just supposed to be about relaxing after a long loong week at work.

I didn‚Äôt. I know drinking will make me nauseous rn. They smoked joints n splifts. I didn‚Äôt. I enjoyed some bits of  food felt kinda bored after I caught up with my main homies n have always disliked any party without a dance floor/ haven‚Äôt been around ppl like that since before covid. So I dipped out. Felt great about leaving n staying sober and seeing my friends for a bit. 
Now I‚Äôm happy to be chillin sober at my home alone n my peace. 

But earlier 

I woke up at 4am. Which was chill. Drank what I thought was an innocent cup of matcha n ended up puking my brains out n feeling like trash ALL day. So sick feeling couldn‚Äôt eat much. Felt myself getting edgy with my mom while she was being really sweet to me. I apologized. She said she understood. She quit weed 2 years ago. She bought me soup I can eat for a few days and I got nuts n fruits to eat. 

I hadn‚Äôt ever had vomiting be apart of my withdrawals before n was seriously shocked I could get so sick detoxing. Told a few friends n my lover about how I was feeling n they didn‚Äôt know I could get sick like that either. But this group knows n has whole threads about it. So its been comforting to talk to y‚Äôall about it or read about it.


Drank peppermint tea n rested for the day then went to see my friends tonight (where the story started) Now I‚Äôm back with my tea. Even thou maybe the get together wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúfun‚Äù sober n feeling like trash is trash 

I still don‚Äôt wanna smoke and that feels so good. Plus if I was stoned leaving early woulda been more awkward feeling. N maybe I would just stayed n drank longer than I shoulda. 

which wasn‚Äôt the move fr fr 

I feel like I‚Äôm honoring myself now 

N can make decisive decisions about what the best move for me is quicker without anxiousness or doubting myself.

This time its different. I don't know what changed but I really feel it this time. 
To be honest I'm not the best husband. My wife has tried to help me quit in the past several times but I just didn't have the motivation. Here is where things get super complicated. My wife asked me yesterday to join her. I told her I don't smoke (Saying that gave me a different feeling then I'm quitting) she was happily surprised. Then I warned her that this is could cause a lot of extra strain on our relationship. She straight up said she can't deal with me like that anymore. And she would divorce me. 
I have 2 options according to her. Keep smoking pot or if i get angry or anything its divorce. 
So fuck it. I'm doing this with or without her. I'm done being in a fog. Done looking forward to my next toke. 
My health recently took a downturn. I'm down 20lbs. I was already on the skinny side. And now I'm struggling with depression. I've thought about antidepressants but my whole childhood was ruined by constant adhd drugs. And then in high school I got hooked on pain killers. Followed by more bad things. Now I really struggle with taking pills. 

I have been on here lurking for months reading peoples successes and it made me think. Why can't I have that. I couldn't think of a reason why so here I am. 

Tomorrow is my day off. I have been sober on my day off in years.

Pros: More energy, sleeping much better, the feeling of wanting to go out and do things, tired of video games ( ill talk about this farther down).

Cons: Welp there aren‚Äôt really any, I‚Äôm still having some issues when it comes to my anxiety, but that comes with time.

When I say I‚Äôm tired of video games, i don‚Äôt mean to shit on any of that community because i feel i am still very much into video games and love the time when playing with friends.  Im talking more when i smoked all i did was sit on my computer and play video games all day, shit had me depressed, bc all i would think is ‚Äúwow this is not fun‚Äù, ‚Äúthere are no good games anymore.‚Äù  Which is completely bullshit, video games are great but taking a break and getting out of that comfort zone makes life worth living again.

My anxiety has been thru the roof tho.  I can‚Äôt stop thinking that i have cancer or some awful disease.

I started smoking weed as something innocent. It was just a thing to do after school with friends and it was normalized in our society and surroundings. After a while I started smoking alone in the evening as well, younger me was convinced weed didn‚Äôt have a addictive nature to it, as I was told by many of my weed smoking friends. When I got out of high school I just kept on smoking more and more often. This really started having a bad affect on my mental and physical health. 

Now a couple of years later I‚Äôm done with this shit. I‚Äôve been traveling trough south east Asia  for a while and I didn‚Äôt have any trouble staying off the weed even though it was widely available there. Unfortunately I had to return back home early because of the coronavirus. When I got back home which was around March of this year I didn‚Äôt have allot of trouble staying off the weed, but then after a couple weeks of social isolation I felt the urge to start again. Not long after that I felt back into my hold habits. Fast forward to last week and I was smoking just as much as before (Which is like 1/1.5g a day) 

Yesterday I was at the tipping point and I flushed all my weed and threw away all my weed accessoires. I‚Äôm feeling really motivated to start working on myself and becoming the best version of myself. I would like to thank you all for the great stories and the motivation for me to quit weed once and for all.

I have written something for you and I hope it fits with the rules here. This was inspired while listening to ""The Power of Now"" during a migraine episode. 

So, here goes..

Mind cannot give lasting peace, or joy

Wanting is a habit of the mind

It always wants something more

Peace comes from overcoming habitual wanting

How to be peaceful?

Drop the identification with thoughts


Be the Watcher


Watch your emotions and the linked thoughts


Are there any unnecessary thoughts?
Is any thought causing pain?
Then they need to be dropped.

Stay in the present and watch the mind

Listen carefully to your inner voice


Is it feeding you negativity? 


Is the thought helpful in any way?


Is there a problem that needs to be solved?


Is the solution constructive or potentially harmful?


Stay out of the mind, which is the burden of the past. Be present. Use the mind as a tool.


It is only a screwdriver. You should be the one holding it. Isn't it funny that it is the other way 'round?

When I smoke, I start not to give a shit about the things I would value a lot in my daily life. Because I have a logic behind it, and although some of these things are hard to accomplish, like less tasty food, going to the gym, and not watching porn, they reward me in the long term. Weed makes me really impulsive, and I just crave more dopamine, which comes from short-term, impulsive joy. I prefer eating fatty-sugary food; I tend to leave my living environment messy and dirty because I'm too lazy for that, and I don't give a shit about it or how much time it would take later on or basically how it would affect my psychology when I see that messy environment next day. 

When it comes to sexuality, for example, I try to stop watching porn since it is unrealistic, hijacking the natural joy and reward mechanisms in your brain. It causes a quick dopamine rush to your brain by over-stimulating all possible primitive instincts as it is designed to do so. But this is a whole other topic. Let's relate it with weed. When it is combined with weed, the impulsiveness you gain from being high plays a considerable role. During my sexual encounters, what I realize is that I enjoy the gentleness of the moment. Gentleness, in this case, is independent of my sexual fantasies. It is more like focusing on the whole state rather than picking up certain objects and actions. I would consider this to be caused by virtue of being a human and incorporating higher cognitive abilities. 

On the other hand, when I smoke and masturbate by watching some porn movies, I feel like an animal. I focus on close up images of only certain ""sexual"" areas of porn stars as the porn movie wanted me to do so. This is also the case for binge eating. Usually, I like to eat healthy things by incorporating my higher cognitive abilities, which are involved in long term rewarding and self-control. Consequently, that healthy food becomes much tastier and unhealthy food becomes less tasty besides overeating being unnecessary. Again, when I am high, I fall into the trap of snacks designed to promote overeating by triggering primitive eating urges we had as an ancient human being in the nature mother's arms. Go for fatty food! Go for sweets! Go for salt! This also feels like pornography to me, and this pornography makes me feel bad afterward for both cases. Because I am normally a self-controlled guy, and I disfavor consumerism in general. I like to go for a better option in terms of eating, physical activity, sleep, and sexual life. This, high me, doesn't feel like myself but some altered lower version of me.",15

Trying a new approach.,"After years of trying the ‚Äúone day at a time‚Äù mindset, which has always ended in failure, I decided to try a ‚Äúone week at a time‚Äù. Ok, many people in recovery tell you to just focus on getting through the day but the problem with that is the next day comes real quick and I‚Äôm feeling the same anxiety. Plus 365 days seems a lot harder than 52. Also, by adapting the one week at a time mindset you have to put several days back to back so there is not that feeling of, ‚Äú if I get through today then I can use tomorrow‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if I will be successful but I needed to try something different. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks and I‚Äôm feeling pretty damn good. I started meditating, stretching, running, and doing body weight exercises, 3 days on 1 rest day 3 days 1 rest etc. I started a new job Monday after being unemployed since May. 

Not sure if I will have success but I‚Äôm not giving up. The one size fits all mentality in recovery always felt uncomfortable to me, so I‚Äôm trying a personalized approach. Find out what works best for you and go for it. 52...2 weeks down and 50 to go!",8

I‚Äôm so grateful I stumbled across the leaves community when I did. I‚Äôve been smoking for 8 years and as soon I started smoking I got obsessed with it instantly. It was the best I‚Äôve ever felt and 1 toke just made all the pressure and stress melt away. The longest I‚Äôve ever quit has been 3 months and I remember how great it felt to be clear and present on a daily basis. 
I‚Äôve known for a couple of years now that my use is not normal and my whole day revolves around how and when I get to smoke. But I was told over and over again by weed culture that ‚Äúweed isn‚Äôt addictive‚Äù, but I‚Äôm definitely addicted. I‚Äôm so sick of it, I‚Äôve been trying to quit for good for 3 years now and I just don‚Äôt know how to make this change permanent. I‚Äôve lost opportunities, ruined relationships, gained 30 lbs, dropped out of college and my health (also mental health) is at an all time low because of my habit. Not to mention how much money I‚Äôve spent on weed throughout the years. 

The last year though I‚Äôve been going through this cycle of buying weed impulsively (because I live in Cali and it‚Äôs so easy to just drop by the dispensary whenever I want) smoking and then freaking out and feeling guilty then immediately flushing it down the toilet or getting rid of it. It‚Äôs been so hard for me to just let it go, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing good that weed has done for me. Ive told myself so many times that ‚Äútomorrow I‚Äôm stopping for good‚Äù then tomorrow comes and I go buy more weed like nothing ever happened and I hate the fact that this habit has control over me. I got rid of all my stash yesterday and after a million failed attempts at quitting, I‚Äôm going to try to quit again for good this time. It‚Äôs crazy how even though I know how bad weed is for me, that I can go back to smoking in an instant.

I‚Äôm ready to make this change permanent and all the posts of users who‚Äôve quit successfully really give me hope that 1 day maybe I can get there too.",18

First, sleep does get bad for the first 3-4 days but after that i am back to normally sleeping without it.  Second thing, exercising really does help with sleep in the early days.  I decided to buy a basketball and go shoot some hoops at the local REC and im telling you guys it helps soo much.  I felt like i had more energy than ever, even played in a pickup game and had a great time.  Third thing i can talk about it that my anxiety and mood swings are still very noticeable.  I‚Äôve been trying to get out there more and talk to people but i just dont know what to say, my mind thinks that if i can‚Äôt find something in common with someone then there is no point to talking to them and i shut down.  Had a bout with my roommates but instead of just getting high to forget and think about it, i actually stood my ground and cleared the air, it felt amazing to finally stand up for myself, which is something i hadn‚Äôt done in the last 3 years of smoking.  I was never this socially anxious person, i used to be very social, friends with most people i went to school with, but weed dragged me down to a place where i became the opposite.  To Anyone reading this,  withdrawals suck ass, but to get your life back is 100% worth it.

Man, tonight has been something else. Told myself the last few days that I wouldn‚Äôt have any cravings; but man was I wrong. Finished off a long work week at a new job, and the first thing I thought was ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt hurt to smoke just tonight and have that be the last time, recover over the weekend‚Äù. After talking to a friend, I realized the 1-3 hours of relaxation wouldn‚Äôt be worth resetting my progress, and I‚Äôm hell-bent on getting this out of my system. Please stay strong, I‚Äôve tried to quit multiple times and I‚Äôve had a daily habit for 10 years (age 17-27). Even if you‚Äôre using the tiniest amount daily, that‚Äôs just another bullshit rationalization, and what I‚Äôve been telling myself for too long. Love you all, I know the next few weeks I will keep having urges but I am stronger than my addiction.

Take care everyone, and if anyone is on their first few days and wants to DM, reach out to me and I‚Äôll offer support. Even if you fall, you get back up; but I‚Äôve fallen so many times that I‚Äôm slowly standing back up, and building metaphorical metal structures to hold my legs and help me reach the sky. If you fall back, just take that time to really think about whether 1-3 hours of one session making you feel chilled out is worth the drug still staying in your system. Every 24 hours without this shit is an incredible victory for us, even if you deal with it one hour at a time.

Love,

I've been a regular user for over 5 years, mostly every evening as soon as I could after getting home or finishing up with work. Been lurking on this sub off and on for the last two years and even posted some small successes on my previous attempts (under a different account). This time I intentionally waited 30 days until posting because I didn't believe I could actually do it. 

I haven't gone this long without smoking in a very long time, so I consider it a real achievement but I'm cautiously optimistic. At first it was very tough as with previous breaks but now I don't have many cravings, just battling fatigue and more recently an intense guilt for not being able to stop sooner. It feels like my life was on auto-pilot for the last five years and I wasn't doing things for myself but rather what others expected of me. I was a fully functional stoner because I convinced myself the bare minimum was good enough to get by in life. 

Having this clarity again for the first time helped me realize I was never a ""just get by"" kind of person. Slowly but surely my motivation and drive are coming back but definitely not 100%. 

Over the last 30 days I've continually come to this subreddit and just read posts whenever I had cravings or thought about giving up. It's amazing how just reading about completely random strangers struggles that are so similar to your own can motivate you. For that, I want to thank each of you for sharing and helping others. 

Not really sure where I was going with the post but thought I'd share the milestone and some of my thoughts. I guess I'll say keep up the good fight. Keep coming here for motivation when you feel like giving up and know that there's complete strangers out there rooting for you. 

Positive vibes!

1- Over the course of trying to quit it's felt like I've forgotten how to talk to people. Alot of this is anxiety and I've discovered that once I start talking I'm okay.
2. Don't drink or smoke nicotine at all during this process. It will take away alot of your progress. 1 step forward 2 steps back will only hurt yourself. 

In terms of other symptoms. I've had alot of overthinking and repetitive thoughts/focus problems. That is starting to get better though.

Here is my advice/take-aways which I hope help. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to provide an answer. Above all - if I can do it - you can also. We are all unique individuals - but the patterns involved in addiction are not unique. I believe that quitting MJ is one of the best decisions I have ever made despite the hardships. I feel way healthier. I was constantly thinking about getting high, which really did not allow me to live in the moment. Without MJ I can live in the moment and my mood and relationships are exponentially more stable. My behavior is based on thought and not impulses. My mind is back to being my own 24/7.


My below advice is based on the patterns and questions I often see here and my understanding of addiction and what has worked for me. If you are depressed, hopeless, etc. please seek professional help - there is no shame in having trouble quitting or with emotional issues - the only shame would be in not trying to get better.


**Here is a condensed version I found from a different post I made:**
https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e1xi0m/guys_i_need_help/f8s875u/


**Keys to Quitting**


**Make a plan and stick to it.** Find a replacement hobby and things to fill the time. What this meant to me was throwing out my paraphenalia and all mj. From there I decided to explore things i always wanted to do but was to lazy to go for. I started training jiu-jitsu which I had been scared of. I went from 1x per week to 4x/week until the Pandemic hit. So instead of smoking and thinking about MJ I was exercising, learning new stuff, and had great social interactions. I believe this was key to my early sobriety as I had motivation to stay healthy and a huge item to fill my time that was constructive. To this day I cannot wait until the Pandemic is over so I can get back to training. I also started playing my guitar again. Any time I was bored I started going for walks outside while listening to music or podcasts. The key point is that not smoking allowed me to expand my horizons and commit to a healthier lifestyle. This has improved my life tremendously. When the Pandemic hit it was very hard for me bc I went from a very social activity to having nothing to do. It really made me appreciate just how important having healthy activities that fill time is in early sobriety along with social interaction.


**Understand addiction.** I often see posts here asking when a person can go back to smoking moderately. This is the trap of addiction. The key to understanding addiction in my opinion is that addiction is a degenerative disease - meaning it only gets worst over time. There is no ""reset"" button on the brain. The only way to resolve an addiction is to not use the substance. Hard stop. Forget about any notion that you can now use moderately because you have abstained for x period of time. That is the addict brain lying to you. Once you have reached any level of addiction it is always there - just waiting for when you decide to use the substance again. Once you realize that this is the reality of the situation it is easier to forget about moderating and just accept that the substance is not for your consumption ever again. I call the above the moderation myth bc I see time and time again people who convince themselves they are now in control and time and time again they end up back here or back on stopdrinking in the same shape they were in prior to quitting. So again - moderation is not an option -it is a pipe dream. Don't fall for it. Abstaining is the only way out of the trap.


**Either you're working on sobriety or you're working on a relapse.** At about the 8/9 month mark I stopped posting here. I thought I was good to go and basically stopped putting in the thought and work to stay sober. I did come back to post that I was really down and thought about using again. This group came to my aid and reminded me that this was a terrible idea. I'll add the link to the post for reference. After analyzing the situation I realized that I was no longer putting in the work to stay sober and that was part of the issue. After that incident I started posting again and reading this sub again. I'm participating in the discord chats. I'm back to being part of the community - so my conclusion is that I'm either working on sobriety or working on a relapse - and not putting in the work is working on a relapse. I'm so glad that I came here and really thought out what was happening instead of giving into the craving. Had I given in - I would probably be back to smoking daily and being miserable or high, and most of the time both of those things. Smoking does not solve any issue - it just makes you ok with having issues and not dealing with them. I've come to find that dealing with issues is way better then running from them. It's not easy - but it is worth it.


**Don't be a dry smoker** (like a dry drunk) - I sort of addressed this with my first tip - but if you only quit smoking and do not add healthy activities, social interactions, hobbies, etc. you will still be miserable. Quitting smoking didn't solve my problems - but it allowed me a clear mind to understand what needed to be done and to do it without any excuses. It gave me the ability to be consistent in my behavior and actions and feel better about life through healthy activities and interactions. So again, I have to emphasize don't just quit smoking.. quit smoking and add some fun stuff like exercise, social activity, etc. and it will be much easier.

Again, everyone can do this. I think I'm pretty awesome (yes, I'm a little narcissistic) - but I also think everyone here who is trying is awesome and capable of success. If there's anything I can ever do to help just reach out to me and I'll do my best. Be good to yourselves, have fun, enjoy life, be ok with being bored, try for new experiences, fail and be ok with it, succeed and celebrate the accomplishments, etc. the bottom line is that life is amazing and life is shitty and life is everything inbetween - but be present and sober to experience it all and life will become more interesting then any session of smoking can ever compare to. :)",24

I've been lurking on here for maybe close to a year now and even during the that year I was sober for 5 months. I messed up completely and thought that I was able to handle weed but it was a lie. Coming to grips that smoking it is not conductive to me living a healthy life. Through years of abusing both weed and porn i've completely lost my way. I've become someone just obsessed with short term pleasure and finding ways to escape the problems of life that I created. My shitty behavior has pushed away friend groups and even the girl I love and left them wanting nothing to do with me. I had a serious moment of clarity last night after the breakup and a realize I never wanted any of this. I was just so accustomed to doing the wrong thing over and over again and then hiding from my problems by using. As the title states I truly think im at a serious point in my life. I can do what I've been doing this whole time and continue going down this road that leads to nowhere but pain, regret, loneliness and mediocrity. Or I can try to make a change in my behavior, habits and lifestyle. So many shitty things have happened this year and it was of my own doing. But it's weird. All things considered im not depressed. Im actually feeling fired up to change. Its a long road ahead but i know that being sober will be whats best for me. Day by day until its normal i need to chip away at my issues and being high wont help. I plan on getting the help i need to beat this shit.

2020-09-25 06:48:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/izhajc/i_am_no_hero_but_i_have_a_secret_2_years_sober/,"I am no Hero, but I have a secret: 2+ years sober","Hello üòä

First off, I am no Hero. I had no option but to quit marijuana because of a second psychotic break. The first one was also caused by the same stuff.


It's my personal opinion that if you are like I was, having a lot of personal issues like: not having a relationship, or a stable family life, or financial issues, please don't smoke or use weed. It won't solve the problem, first of all. Second of all, like in my case, if it becomes the sole source of pleasure in your life, it will take over your life. One seemingly harmless trigger was all it took to throw me headfirst into psychosis.


My whole life, which I had rebuilt painstakingly, was destroyed again by my second psychosis. So, in my mind, if I started using again, it would probably have killed me. My psychiatrist hammered the final nail: he just said, ""Weed is not for you"" and I don't know why, it had a tremendous impact on me.


In the days that followed, I was on my own, left alone to rebuild my life. I had to fix my financial situation and my life in general. It was very painful and confusing, not having anything to fall back on for giving me a boost.

Months went by, when I suddenly made the resolution that: I will not try to think about achieving everything at once. Whatever Action I can take today, I will take it. I took everything one day at a time. Once I had a sharp memory which had been eroded over time. So, I started making lists of things to do today and kept breaks in between. I had become physically weak and depressed. So I took it easy. Focused on 1 day at a time.

Gradually, as I started accomplishing my goals, at first, small ones like.. eating healthy and sleeping on time, reaching work on time, taking a shower every day, etc. I didn't know it, but I was resetting the reward system in my brain. Each time I got something done, I felt happy. Then, I moved on to bigger things like, taking initiative at work, speaking up, taking on more responsibilities, moving to a suitable home for bringing my family there, etc. 

Now, I feel that, no matter what, I can deal with any situation. Yeah, it's true that I still don't have a significant other. But I have stabilized my life and I am happy for it. I have regained my family's respect and younger members look up to me now. I have become indispensable at my workplace. 

Friends, staying sober is all about resetting the reward system in the brain. More you accomplish your goals, more happy you will be. You don't have to be an Oscar-winner or a rock star in one day. Just focus on keeping yourself healthy. Be relaxed. Do what you can today. Keep going and your efforts will multiply. Your life will be better than you can dream of. Love your body 'cause it's amazing. Keep moving forward. 

Old memories may flash in your mind but they are in the past. The future is born from the Present. Destiny is in your hands.

All the best ! üòä",203

I never thought I would have made it this far given I would smoke 10+ cigarettes per day and 3/4 joints but I'm coming to realise I can surprise myself.

To those who are thinking of quitting, you can do it. The first 3 weeks are so will be terrible; I would recommend going out for a brisk walk and taking baths to wind down. Once the first month is out of the way the cravings become way less severe and you can start to live your life again and experience life with clarity of mind.",13

It‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt even enjoy my time, it‚Äôs just something to do, for the hell of it. There‚Äôs no point in continuing. 

I‚Äôve also realized that I just don‚Äôt enjoy weed, like other people, do. I‚Äôm not the type to be able to calm down and relax. It‚Äôs honestly the exact opposite, more times, than not. My brain just goes into overdrive and I end up getting upset with myself or how my life is going. 

I no longer want to keep doing this. I think it‚Äôs finally time I take back control and actually do what I have continuously told myself, I would do, to no avail. I will be giving up smoking weed. 

I feel like this will finally help me get to where I have been wanting to. I‚Äôll actually keep a job, I‚Äôll actually start working out, and eating healthy. I will actually be working on my hobbies and skills.

I feel this way because mentally I have shifted my life and moved past the stoner life. I am so far done with it, it is not who I am or want to be. It has been so much easier to quit because of it. Here's what I did","On day 9 I had a break through. I snapped out of the depression. I still feel low here and there but that haltered/depression/wanting to cry etc etc is GONE. I have quit before and those symptoms lasted WEEKS because I hadn't made that mental shift. I hadn't moved passed weed. I was still fighting it so hard and not accepting my new life. You NEED to do the following: 

1. Eat healthy - affects you mentally more than you know it. Affect your energy the next day. Low energy = sadness

2. Sweat - try and exercise. If you don't want to, go for a walk. Stop wallowing in your own sadness and take control of your life. You're an adult right? 

3. Connect with people and open up - talking to people instantly improves my mood. It takes me out of the depression in my head. 

4. Journal - be honest with yourself 

5. Envision who you want to be - leave all the stoner shit behind. Leave those friends, those subs, ANYTHING that reminds you of it

6. Take it 1 day at a time - this. Remember tomorrow is a new day. If today sucks, that's fine. Sober people feel low on different days. 

7. Meditate - allows you to be more aware of your thoughts. Allows you to stop yourself from going down the negative rabbit hole that leads to relapsing 

8. Love yourself for trying to make a difference.

Stop overthinking this shit. For the people who haven't quit or just quit, you WILL suffer for a week or two, there is no avoiding it. Be honest with yourself. Be a fucking adult and just deal with it. There were some days when I felt low and all I did was lay on the couch and watch the Sopranos. That's fine, just don't smoke. I knew the negative feelings would fade and it's just temporary. It's ok if you waste the day by laying around while not smoking. It will pass, you WILL feel better.",26

She got very disappointed mostly because I got weed into the house, lack of trust and because she fears what could happen if I keep doing it. I gave no excuses and listened attentively to what she had to say. The conversation led to another discussion about life per se. It made me reflect on a lot of things that I do. I want to make clear that weed hasn‚Äôt given me any problems with anybody or anything. The things that I want are to have no more problems with my family because of it, and to improve stamina in order to perform amazingly in sports I practice like Muay Thai. This is why I want to quit or lower the habit. 

This week before all this happened I had not smoked in two days because I was tired from work and doing sports. I slept amazingly without consumption of marijuana, which made me very happy and told my brain that I do not need THC necessarily to sleep better.

I am planning on cutting the dose and/or quit. I did not get sad but things made me reflect on numerous subjects in my life that can help me grow, educate myself and learn to reach an even better form of myself.

If anyone is willing to talk to me in this subject, give advice or just show support please don‚Äôt hesitate to hit my DMs.

It made me relax after a long day of hard work, it helped me make some great new friends and calmed down my anxiety to help me sleep better.

However, I decided to quit. It was time for me to begin studying at college and I figured that this would be a great time to see what influence weed has had on my life. After a few days of some cravings it felt like the habit had been broken and I started to settle in to my new ""normal"".

A few weeks later down the road though, I am really starting to questioning if this descicion was really worth it. To be honest, I have not seen any positive consequenses of not smoking weed.  I really do feel exactly the same, except the fact that I do not enjoy life nearly as much. 

&#x200B;

I still work 20+ hours per week within my own company. (That i started while smoking weed)

I still study math and programming for 40+ hours per week. (Which I also did while smoking weed)

My chess rating has dropped 100-200 points since I stopped. (And I don¬¥t enjoy it nearly as much compared as when I used to be blazed and play)

It‚Äôs almost like, because there‚Äôs no strong flavor, it‚Äôs exclusively tactile. When crunching on carrots, I‚Äôm not thinking about the taste. I‚Äôm thinking about chewing. But by the end I have successfully eaten food, and healthy foods at that!

Maybe this is just me, but I hope this can help someone!",5

I‚Äôm definitely experiencing withdrawal symptoms - no appetite, can‚Äôt sleep, etc. - and this journey is totally intimidating but I‚Äôm finally ready. 

My fianc√© is a night owl and I‚Äôm a morning person (sometimes I wonder if my anxiety forces this). I‚Äôve always smoked weed at the end of the day and fallen asleep earlier than him. Obviously this isn‚Äôt happening now that I‚Äôve decided to quit  and last night was extremely eye opening for me. He normally has to shake me awake before he goes to bed to remind me to leave the couch. I‚Äôve been really restless after working hours without smoking so I decided to turn off all electronics before bed and stretch so that I could (hopefully) wind down for sleep. We got into bed and started talking... and talking... and talking. We talked about so many different things - how he‚Äôs feeling at his job, movies, family, politics, the life we want to live once were financially free. Granted we do discuss these things all the time but never at night. At night I was always a zombie and unable to bring myself to talk because I was high and I think he was just used to that. So used to it, at the end of our conversation he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember the last time we did this, talked late into the night‚Äù. I was thinking the same thing at that time and my response to him was that I was always high and unable to. Saying this out loud to him was so healing for me. I would think it would illicit feelings of guilt (kind of did but it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming) but after saying it I just felt so good. I felt like I was actually committing to this new life and understanding that I could gain so many of the things I had lost and more.

That being said I‚Äôm going to try to remember this feeling on bad days. I‚Äôm grateful for this group because all of your posts have inspired me in so many ways. This is my first-ever reddit post, too ‚ò∫Ô∏è something my high/anxious/paranoid self would have never let me do.",66
2020-09-24 09:07:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iywx45/smoking_weed_is_ruining_my_life_and_that_still/,"Smoking weed is ruining my life, and that still isn't a good enough reason to quit.","I have been smoking weed on and off now for the past 12 years and I am finding it incredibly difficult to stop. I have lost so much because of choosing to smoke weed, boyfriends, friends and even the little bit of family I had. 

A brief intro to my history:

I have never had a close relationship with my family, I grew up with my dad but he is very abusive and has narcissistical personality traits, so we never really could form a real relationship and even now he picks and chooses when he wants to be in my life and it's only when he needs or wants to brag about something. My mother, she only cares for my sisters, who grew up with her and herself (mostly herself) and if anything happens, I am my dad's daughter and his problem in her eyes. Anyway, the only person I was kind of close to was my sister but we had a huge fight at Christmas, I was abusing weed prior to seeing her because my friend recently had taken her own life and I was using the drug to numb how I felt, usually when I smoke weed, it's when I am sad. Anyhow it made me very irritable and unfortunately I took that out on her. Anway she has no interest in making friends, and I have to wait for her, to forgive me. Anyhow, what little family I had, I don't have any more or I won't for a while.

Furthermore, I don't have any real friends, I have moved around the world a lot, and have been creating these meaningless lose friendships, where once you have moved away, so does the friendship. I have been in this current city for around 4 years now, I did manage to make some nice friends here at the beginning but my weed habit is was getting worse and worse and since my friend died, I think I subconsciously gave up quitting. I have been using weed to cure any form of bad emotion and this has made me very anti-social and anxious. I almost always cancel plans, if I make plans and I actually can't cancel, I am praying that the other person will and if I have to go meet them, I am counting down the minutes so I can leave and smoke. People have stopped liking me because I am so unreliable, my negativity and obsession with weed. I am not a pleasant person to be around sometimes. Also recently a good friend who was living with me for the past year and a half moved out. In the end, she couldn't watch me sabotage myself anymore and left. She was always so disappointed and upset when I would smoke after a few weeks quitting (Similar to my boyfriend). It got too much for her but still after this, it has only driven me to smoke more. In fact, when she lived with me, I tried harder not to smoke.

I have a boyfriend, but I am not sure how much longer he can stay with me, it's very stressful for him to see me in these really low periods and especially when it has been induced or made worse by weed. He is the only person, I actually genuinely care about and like. I am so irritable now, I find it so hard to like people, I think everyone is in the wrong and I am right but I know it is not true, it is me not them that is the problem. My previous boyfriend broke up with me because of my weed problem and so my last and last one and last one. Another thing my current boyfriend moved to another country in the summer and I can't follow him because I am stuck here for at least another year, so we are doing long distance, which is also contributing to my sadness. At the moment he is the only person I can stand to be around but I see him once a month and even then he is always scared to see me at first because he doesn't know if I have smoked or not. Usually two days after I smoked, I am my worst self, its not nice for others but it only usually lasts for around 2 days, but if I have constantly quitting and then relapsing.  Another thing, I developed a mechanism to cope with traumatic situations when I was a kid called dissociation and seem to carry going into this mental process when anything bad happens, so when I have acting awful, I separate myself mentally from the situation, so when I am back to normal, I am not truly aware of how I actually was during those two days. Additionally, when I smoke weed, I lose track of time, I have been high for three weeks and it feels like a day.

This isn't the first time I have been stuck in these destructive cycles but this is the worst I have been in 7 years. 7 years ago I was also getting into this cycle of smoking weed and I lost all my friends in my hometown and, then I moved countries and stopped smoking for 3 years, and everything was fine and I was only feeling depressed occasionally, then I moved to a country where weed is very accessible and slowly the past four years, I have come back to where I was 7 years ago. 

I have been seeing Psychologist on and off the past year but it hasn't really helped me and it is also very expensive so I can't see her as much as I'd like, maybe that is the reason why it isn't working so well. 

So yeah, I can't stop smoking weed, people have given up on me and it seems I have too.",25

I'm not going to actually delve into any political issues, because that's not what this sub is for, but, I recently realized that I believe I should give a shit about politics and not coast through life without recognizing what is happening in the world and how it affects people.

I'm also notttt trying to shame anyone reading this that isn't politically engaged, but I will suggest it. And I recognize that, like me, you need to have that ""spark"" that gives you the desire first. So no pressure.

**Before I ramble on**: I think I'm on day 6 -- I already lost count, and I feel like that's a good thing since it means weed hasn't been on my mind at all wooooooooooo

Anyways, I'm 28 and never gave a damn about politics and always thought history was boring af, but just like a month ago I realized that these things are actually really interesting and important and I've started reading books and educating myself by other means, too and I think I want to be some kind of political activist and try to make a good impact on society.

I was always kind of ""just there"" for a lot of my life. Just in the corner, doing my own thing. People would be like, ""who is that?"" and someone else would respond, ""I don't know. He's just that weird guy in the corner.""

In closing, I wouldn't say that quitting weed lead to me having some kind of ""awakening,"" but rather that an awakening is the motivation I needed to finally stop just laying around all day smoking weed.",34

Ive learned that having boredom that is like debilitating and detrimental to mental health isnt really normal. I have okay mental health, its shit right now but thats to be expected due to the circumstances. So im thinking that my use was caused by my intense boredom.

Weed used to be fun, I liked to mong out and giggle with mates. But then I started smoking on my own and that's where the problem started for me, now I close up and get so anxious.

For example, when I smoked before meeting people I would be so tense and riddled with anxiety, and I wouldn't even smoke a lot. I would care too much, so much so that I wouldn't be myself, i wouldn't be able to speak without a few minutes of mind games about whether or not to say the joke or sentence I was thinking of and by that time the time had passed to say it. 

Recently my daily objective as soon as I wake up would be to smoke a bowl/bong. Once I did that my day was practically over as it meant I did nothing but smoke for the rest of the day. Day over. On to the next where I did the same thing, months have gone by like this. 

I'm sure weed is great for some people but I think I've smoked enough now and it's time to move on.

The things that have helped me so far when I get cravings are to do some press ups, meditate or go for a walk.

I am quitting because I am interested in joining the military and they are very strict about no smoking. In addition, I am finally able to admit how much of a crutch marijuana has been for me. 

I‚Äôve suffered from anxiety for years that was very bad when I started smoking. I overthink EVERYTHING constantly especially in social situations. Marijuana allows me to check out of my constantly whirring and cycling thoughts. At the time it was the only thing I could find that helped. I‚Äôve started a lot of yoga and meditation which has helped tremendously. I then cut down my weed usage to only once or twice a day max at night when my anxiety is at its worst... but I can‚Äôt seem to fully cut ties. 

I am scared that I‚Äôll quickly relapse into my old ways so part of the reason for this post is to hold my self accountable.

I used to be so bad at quitting that I would last barely more than few days before I found myself texting my dealer. Although I still think of weed every once and a while I don't crave it. I don't want to smoke it. It actually disgusts me. 

3 tips that worked for me to get to 90 days. 

1. Use an addiction tracking app to count the days. Don't keep the tally in your head. Get an app and put that widget on your home screen. The higher the tally the harder it will be to reset the count. 

2. After each day realize the day went fine and you don't wish you smoked that day. You'll see you can be perfectly fine without weed. And you'll feel better when you go to sleep. 

3. Find another activity to get addicted to. For me it was running and cycling. It gives an even better high but you have to work for it. I found I smoked a lot of weed because I was lazy and bored and looking for something to do. Weed is an easy way to fill the time and make the day go by.",11

So I'm currently 23 and I have been smoking since 19. At first I considered smoking quite harmless and didn't really do it that often. But cradually I have started to smoke more and more and especially during 2020 I started to have some multiple day smoking sprees. At most I smoked maybe like 4 joints per day.

I have had some small withdrawal symptoms earlier but today I got a real reality check. I smoked 1 joint in the morning and now at night I had some cold sweats and had to throw up. This addiction has gone too far and I need to stop.

I would love to discuss about any tips or questions you guys might have. Thank you all in advance.",1

My doctor recommended that I wean, however I‚Äôm not sure this is the best route because it seems like it would just extend the process. What are some strategies you used to quit and would you recommend cold turkey or weaning? Thanks üíï",2

Some very nice people told me it was normal and to keep calm and carry on. I powered through the urges to smoke, lack of sleep, mood changes and sweats to get to place where I feel so happy in my own skin. I've always been a confident guy on the outside in amongst friends and acquaintances but was actually holding alot of anxiety. I used weed to try and deal with the internal conflict and it may of worked initially but after years of constant smoking I had let it consume me and magnify the anxiety. 

I've just split with my girlfriend although completely unrelated to my previous habit and it wasn't a nasty break up by any means but I've been reflecting on life and wanted to share my experience to anyone who is considering quitting, is facing issues quitting, has faced anxiety and feels alone. Keep going things will get easier and you'll feel great when it does. My anxiety hasn't disappeared completely but I've definitely gone a long way putting out those flames rather than adding to the fire with weed. 

Hope this helps atleast one person!

Quitting is not just putting down the pipe or vape pen, its repairing all the broken ways of thinking from the ground up. It takes hard work and lots of mental preparation. For those in the early stages I know things can seem scary and really difficult. It does get better. A little over 3 months later and its a different ball game now. I'm not plagued with sleep, appetite or mood problems like I was in the beginning. Its still there but way, way less intense now. Everyones experience will be different but I'm prepared for a year or two for full recovery after having been a daily stoner for 25 years. For those curious here is my experience broken down by timeline:

* Weeks 1 to 2:
   * Major interuption to my sleep schedule
   * Loss of appetite
   * Mood instability with periods of depression, anxiety and low points
* Weeks 2 to 4:
   * Improvements in all 3 major categories of sleep, appetite and mood
   * Cravings started to diminish
   * Less brain fog and able to focus a little more
* Month 2:
   * Sleep patterns start to get under control and dreams start to surface again, some of them pretty intense. Some good, some bad.
   * Eating is basically 100% back on track. Natural hunger seemed a little bizzare to me at first
   * My mood seems pretty well moderated again now. Some lows, some highs but generally pretty stable
   * Cravings not really a thing anymore (at least not like at first) though I do experience thoughts about weed and my brain thinking ""its time to get stoned"", mostly triggered by events or my routine.
* Month 3:
   * Sleep comes much more easily now. If I stay away from my phone and just lay down I usually drift off in 30 minutes or so. Sometimes I wake up through the night but I can usually fall right back to sleep again. My sleep feels more restful.
   * Appetite is fine
   * Mood is quite good. There are still issues with anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) however there are glimmers of hope as I'm starting to feel my zest for sober life coming back. My emotions are still burried pretty deep I think but I believe things are on their way back. Weed (and alcohol) served as a basis for my emotions for so long I know it will take time. Sometimes I lose my motivation and ambition but generally things have been pretty good. There is work to be done on my mental state and it was the thing most highly affected by my former lifestyle without a doubt. I'm working on it and while its a slow process things are getting better and even with that I'm enjoying my life so much more than before. 

I'm excited to see my progression and continue to make improvements in my life. Quitting weed on its own isn't the key to a better life, its what I do with my new found clear mind and better attitude that'll take me where I want to go. It's work. Life will always have its ups and downs with or without weed. Weed was one of the big downs that I finally realised I have control over so I've eliminated it from my life. For good. I'm not afraid of being a sober person anymore.",15

At the start I loved it and couldn‚Äôt ever see myself quitting. I even said to myself I wouldn‚Äôt care if I was a stoner for the rest of my life. 

My mum has bi polar and has been an alcoholic my whole life. I smoked to be able to tolerate being around her when she was a drunk when I was her full time carer I was always stoned. I moved two hours away with my partner so only smoke when I go back and see her. She is 500 days sober now from alcohol and when ever I see her I still smoke myself into oblivion and so does she and because I go so long without smoking when I‚Äôm with my boyfriend when I smoke I get so high. 

My partner hates me smoking weed and everytime I go back to see my mum I stay there for 4 days and we just get so high, lately I feel like I‚Äôve been going into a bit of a psychosis. Knowing that what I‚Äôm doing is wrong and hating myself. Feeling like I‚Äôm trapped. Almost like I‚Äôm in hell. I feel like I‚Äôm in another universe but I find it so hard to leave when I have to go back to reality. Everytime I come back home from my mums my partner and I fight like crazy because I‚Äôm so emotional and my mood swings are all over the place, I feel so fragile. He reminds me of all the reasons I shouldn‚Äôt be smoking and I just fall into a self hate and pity cycle. It really damages our relationship? 

I tell myself I won‚Äôt smoke again but I end up going back to my mums and smoking anyway. It is a pattern. I‚Äôm scared of not being able to bond properly with my mum without the weed. She said she is happy to stop if I do as she is not addicted. I associate going back to my mums with smoking weed and just being able to numb myself out. One of my best friends smokes weed and I have never been around her without being stoned. I feel quitting will change our entire relationship and I won‚Äôt be able to see her because I won‚Äôt be able to say no. I‚Äôm ready to quit for GOOD because I know it causes me so many problems and I want my relationship to work with my partner. 

When I quit for 4 months I was still so depressed and couldn‚Äôt find the motivation to do anything. I know I have a problem even when I don‚Äôt smoke for 4 weeks when I go back and see my mum I can‚Äôt stop smoking I have to keep smoking bongs even through out the night. Should I throw out all of my weed paraphernalia?? Why do I feel like I‚Äôm so attached and can‚Äôt do it. I feel so sad thinking about quitting weed for good like I am grieving a huge part of my life. I am sad that I won‚Äôt be able to get stoned with certain people again and laugh like we used to.

I just wanted to share a particular problem I face when trying to quit. I have been trying to quit gradually by trying taking longer and longer breaks, but after my third attempt at a break broke down abruptly yesterday, I was feeling a little dejected and decided to seek some help.

Starting a break I am really pumped up. I make a calendar on my wall and start crossing off days when I didnt smoke. I start doing my work, working out, reading, playing soccer outside, singing and making music and overall everything becomes exactly how I want. I make a schedule everyday and everything. But everything there is a minor inconvenience, like I couldn't solve a particular problem after even after 30 mins or missed out a job application or something, I become really really sad. Like nothing can make me happy at this moment even if I try. Subsequently, I lose all desire and drive to further work at it and just laze around or escape or my work.

This usually leads to me thinking that if I am not working anyway, why not toke? Or a stoner friend (I have many at this point) will end up calling me to ask for a smoke (a breakdown like this usually happens in the late evening/night, when everyone starts smoking) and more often than not, I end up smoking. Even if i do manage to identify that this is my body craving weed and get back to work, I inevitably find a way to justify it and do it.

The longest I have been able to go without it since I started trying to quit last month is 3 days.

Any comments or suggestions would be hugely hugely appreciated. I welcome any and all forms of accountability and would love to know why works for you guys.

Thanks a lot for reading!",1

Im a shy, introvert overthinking even when i was a kid, i remember when i was in elementary school, my teacher ask my class some questions, no one know the answer and I know the answer but can't stand up to answer the question because i think everyone in class will look at me, so I do not stand up to answer, that how shy i was
Fast forward to junior high school, i was addicted to game,truant to playing video games all day, sometimes it's boring, i dun want to play game anymore but what can i do because i have no friends, look at theme laugh, play together i was so sad, i wish i was like them, but i have no one,  So I fell back into video games
When i was 19 , someone i know let me try weed, boom, i was happy, free, anxiety-free, i was laugh, that when i know i loves this plant, i was love weed more than anything, then i research about weed, like how No one has yet died from marijuana, Obama smoke it and he is president of USA,so it's don't harm,so it not a a drug, it a plant
Since then my life is all about weed,people i hanging out, people i know, what i do or what i think is all about weed, i love weed so so much, i even learns how to grow, how to order seeds from oversea, learn about different strain, sativa indica etc
From sometime i smoke when i meet a guy with weed to maybe one a two a month to i bought it myself to one a week to daily smoke, fast forward i smoke daily for 4 years
I remember the day my mom found me smoke weed, that when i was 20, she cry in front of me, think i drug addictions , she told my dad, that the first time i saw my dad cry,  Asia parents u know, weed = heroine, but i told her she was wrong, it just weed, it legel in USA, in Canada, Netherland, in developing countries. I told her i will not smoke anymore but in my mind she was wrong and i was right, so what the point? weed is harmless right? So i continue smoke , hide its from my parents. i was so young so with stubborness
I continue smoke , from only with friend to i smoke alone, smoke weed, stay up late night to play video games, sometimes hanging out with another stoner to smoke weed, that all i do because i love it. from a smart kid i when to stoner kid, i don't care what people think about me and weed, is just weed, if u think i drug addiction then u wrong and i right, weed is not a drug, is a plant, weed is harmless so fuck what u think
Then the problem comes, i smokes and plays video games so much,my parents rich so i don't need to work,never had a sport or go to gym, i feel very weak, i don't have energy, frogs in my head is so thick, i can't even function,i can't go to public, i can't look to everyone eye when talk, i feel low-self esteemed .i lock me in my room, i don't want to talk or meet anyone, even my parents , i was so fucking depressed, but weed is harmless right? I think it my fault, not weed. 
Then one day i had panic attached from smoke some strong strain, i thought i was going to die, that the first time i thought i has to quit, but the next day i smoke again, forgot the the thought when i had panic attack

But weed don't do it for me anymore, i don't feel happy, free, anxiety-free , i feel anxious, overthinking, anti social , depression everytime i smoke, i regret , i thought i had to quit,i try to quit but i can't, if i don't smoke weed what can i do?  I won't be able to meet stoner friend? i will addiction to game again? i will be depressed , i will be lonely..That the fucking loops i seem can't to get out.
i was smoke to escape my reality, my problems, my life

I live in small villages,  where people know each other, what they do or what they reputation is.
one day i hear my neighborhood talk about me, they thought me i was addicted, maybe im so fucking skinny, maybe my dark circles around my eyes, maybe i dunno . From smart good students kid reputation i go to addiction kid, i feel so fucking shame, i feel regret, i feel guilty, i hate myself , i  hate my life, i dun want to live like this anymore, but i dunno how to do
Im 25 years old this year, my life is still very long,but i feel so lost, i wants my parents proud, i want go to gym to have good looking body, i want a good wife, i want a family of my own, i want some good friend not about smoke weed but about share things happy moments in life, i want a small business where i can so my talents. but i dunno what to do?
Im on day 5 to quit, the lonely feeling, the regret, the shame, the depression , my emotional comeback but i know i dont have smoke anymore, i know i had to quit or my life will suck to the end.",1

I smoked for about 4 years with the frequency increasing to on a daily basis towards the end. I was by no means a hardcore stoner or anything but I started to realize how weed was becoming a prerequisite to my daily activities and hobbies. I started to notice some mental issues developing as well. I stopped cold turkey and I threw out all of my weed and smoking kit. I felt really good about myself when I did it and didn't feel any regret. Over the next few weeks I started to feel much more clear minded and started to feel happy again but I still had those urges to get high and FOMO whenever I would think back to the ""good times"".

Fast forward to a few days ago I convinced myself that I could start smoking responsibly and moderate in in a way that would benefit me. I went out and bought some weed along with $65 dollars worth of accessories (pipe, grinder, etc.) The next day I packed my first bowl and it hit me hard. It wasn't a good high to be honest but it wasn't bad either, I just felt kinda meh the rest of the day. 

The next day (today) I smoked a smaller amount and I went in an hour later to work. Back when I was desensitized to THC I'd be high at work all the time with no problems but this small amount of weed still hit me pretty hard because I was on an empty stomach and had just worked out. I work in a busy fast food drive thru and I'm usually pretty fast at preparing orders but today my performance was absolutely terrible. I clocked in in the middle of a rush and there was broken equipment which led to backed up orders and impatient customers waiting for their orders (didn't help that the customers can see me making their orders through the glass). I was having an internal panic attack for 2 hours and all of my coworkers noticed. I don't know if they knew I was high or if they just thought I was stuck on stupid but I single handedly made that lunch rush way more difficult because I was high. I basically looked like a new guy except I've been working there for two years. I was super slow and I kept forgetting which order I was working on. I was really embarrassed and no one really said anything to me about it but I definitely heard people talking shit quietly amongst each other and others were upset at the whole situation, understandably. The entire time I didn't say anything to any of my coworkers and none of them asked me if I was okay or anything so this awkward tension was building up as we got more and more slammed with orders. 

That had to be the worst day I've had in a long time and none if it would have happened had I not been high. I realize now that weed is something that I've grown passed. I romanticize the good times I've had while high and the ""benefits"" I thought that I was missing out on but today showed me how I was wrong about that. I was definitely better off sober. I made an ass out of myself and wasted money. Hard lesson learned.",13

The main issue is time, i have way too much time to fill without smoking so starting tomorrow im going to hit up some old friends i haven‚Äôt spoken to in a while and go work out for the first time in years, honestly it‚Äôs going to suck, but I‚Äôm hoping i feel the endorphin rush after and never look back.  I am also going to try quitting vaping starting today too, i had a lot of flem in my throat over the entire day and i want to be able to wake up and not crave it anymore!  

Sleep...  sleep has still been hard i continue to lay in bed for hours at a time trying to force myself to sleep, but im hoping that in a couple days everything goes back to normal.  One thing i am really excited for is my dreams to come back, it may sound silly, but i really want to experience it again.  

Withdrawals sucks, but as a community for smokers trying to quit we can all make it thru and see the light.  You guys have encouraged me to do more with my life, and i owe my life to you guys!  Good luck, we are stronger together!

Firstly, English is not my main language.  
Just wanted to write an update for my 4th month after quitting.

  
I'm 31 now and I smoked daily for 10 years.  
I dropped out of University in my 4th year of Sociology Major at 23 and since then had no end jobs in showbusiness production. My very supportive parents gave me always money and freedom... not necessarily a good combination for a stoner like me, I probably wasted both of those things.  
Anyway, weed was for sure not helping me to mature and do something out of myself, the last months before quitting I had major anxiety every time I smoked.   
So just FYI before quitting I had started to exercise 3 times a week, managed to get kind of fit and have stayed with that routine after quitting, it's been very helpful overall.

  
Long story short, two months in after quitting I started taking online programming courses , I learned in the first month CSS and HTML coding -did some small projects- and now I'm very engaged with JavaScript. I had no prier experience with programming, and btw, seems like I suck in logic and math, but i feel I get every day better and it helps me to sharpen my mind again, so much so that I enrolled in a full time 9 weeks programming bootcamp that's starting in a few weeks. I'm a bit nervous about it and  hope I will be able to stay focused and take the most of that experience, I really enjoy the freedom programming can give me for creating my own projects (i don't have a lack of ideas and creativity) and also the work prospect it gives - decent salary, remote location, etc - seems there is still a lack of developers in my country.   


Most certain if I had kept smoking I wouldn't have dedicated so much time and energy into this and also wouldn't have build a clear path for my future. This is only the small beginning of a lifetime journey.

I hope this encourages other fellow stoners, to know, that if you quit and also put the effort to learn something new and do a changes in your lifestyle, good change will always come. 

&#x200B;

Take care!  
I'll do and update in 2 months.",32

I hate posting my problems but here we go. I have really mixed feelings. 
I quit mostly because of financials. I‚Äôve spent the past 2 years on and off smoking. The longest i‚Äôve made it is 1 month. When i‚Äôm in full stoner mode its a real self loathing place. I struggle with anxiety, weed quickly became a crutch. For years i only ever smoked with friends and never had a stash at home. At one point when dispensary‚Äôs became a thing i said what the hell and started buy pre rolls. As well all know that quickly can turn into a habit. That was around the time i met what was at the time the love of my life. We moved in with each other and i turned her into a stoner for half a year. Something i still feel guilty about. I don‚Äôt need to go into details but weed basically ruined the person she fell in love with. I became a liar. Allot of lies, from what i‚Äôm aware of she didn‚Äôt figure out. I lost 20 pounds moved back home and self loathed with one night stands on tinder and multiplied my use of weed. But even with all the harm it has cause me i still can‚Äôt quit for real reasons. Only because i need money for rent. I‚Äôm afraid that the first chance i get i‚Äôll jump right back in. Considering my only friend group is are my band mates and they‚Äôre all heavy users.

I was hanging out with my friend and I went to his house to match him. We started smoking as soon as I got there and I noticed it was kind of difficult to find topics to converse on. As the night went on we got one of our other friends to hang with us and at that point we were all pretty fucked up. I kid you not it was like one of those anti weed 70s ads where that girl is just sitting there flat unresponsive.

I don't have that anymore now and I'm having trouble dealing with everything that is happening because of corona.

* My canceled bachelor party
* Not seeing my friends 
* Not being able to do my sports (I do a heavy contact sport)
* Stupid politicians
* ...

I'm tempted to smoke again to be able to cope with the loneliness I'm feeling and to forget about all the troubles in the world. But I also don't want to smoke since it does not solve any of those problems. Except for the way I feel. 

How do you cope with these things without weed?",8

It‚Äôs sort of like a break up.,"get to know your sober self! let those emotions you‚Äôre escaping make an appearance and feel them through! don‚Äôt hang out with people who smoke! write a list of reasons you want to quit and hang it on your wall to remind yourself why you started this process! find ways to move your body and sweat! treat yourself to something nice once you‚Äôve hit a mini milestone in your sobriety! MAKE GOALS! start journaling and watch yourself grow quicker than you ever imagined possible! realize the addiction is all in your head! Meditate daily! think about how proud future you will be for what you‚Äôre committing to now! you CAN do this :) 

congrats to everyone here for making this decision to take control of your life. 
before you know it you‚Äôll have gone two days, and then a week.. and then a month! And you‚Äôll feel feelings you haven‚Äôt felt in years. You‚Äôll laugh from a place that is so deep in your belly, you didn‚Äôt even know you had it before. Each day will get easier. Sure the temptation is there from time to time but I‚Äôm creating goals for myself and I simply cannot achieve them if I‚Äôm blitzed all the time. 
I am so proud of myself for sticking with it this far, and I am proud of you for finding the courage to kick this habit. you aren‚Äôt alone, you are stronger than you realize, and the life you have been dreaming of is just around the corner‚Äîgo after it!!!

I‚Äôve been an on-and-off smoker of both for at least 10 years but recently it had gotten a lot worse. I‚Äôm 27 years old and I‚Äôm generally not too happy with what I‚Äôve accomplished in life thus far, but the past 40 days have been amazing. I‚Äôve gotten back in touch with my faith, started eating healthy/exercising and also haven‚Äôt masturbated or used porn in that timespan. 

Well, today as i was cleaning out the backseat of my car, I noticed my old bubbler was still sitting underneath my driver‚Äôs seat in its case (not a good place for it and honestly didn‚Äôt even know it was there). I felt conflicted about what to do. My immediate impulse was to find a local dumpster to dispose of it but i honestly felt guilty about that. I‚Äôm the type of person who hates/feels guilty about waste, and so I considered texting either a friend or family member who still smokes and giving it to them, but something about this didn‚Äôt feel right to me, either. Maybe I just didn‚Äôt want to be triggered or maybe I just didn‚Äôt like the idea of enabling someone else‚Äôs bad habit. Eventually I decided to throw it in the dumpster of an apartment complex near my house, and I promised myself that in order to make up for the waste, I would come home and write this post to encourage others.

I‚Äôm especially speaking to the younger users here: there is no point in smoking every day. If you‚Äôre doing it, stop right now. It‚Äôs not doing as much for you as you think it is. You‚Äôll be way stronger without it and if you want to talk to someone much older who has in all likelihood smoked more than you in my lifetime, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôve quit for long periods of time in the past but this time is for good. Cheers to clean lungs and a clear head. I discovered this sub back in 2014 and it has helped me many times in the past, so it‚Äôs only right that I give back.",35

Today I woke up and instead of hitting some weed, I instead hit my pull up bar and it felt great. My body changed dramatically from muscle body to a stoner body in the last year and a half. I spent upwards of 700 euros that I could of saved up, I ran away from my problems, ignored my emotions and pushed people away for that moment of peace where I didn't have to care about anything, I was in bliss. That is, for good 15 minutes or so. After that my high is filled with feelings of regret, shame and paranoia. Generally speaking, my life is on the right path, I have a stable job after finishing high school and a girlfriend that loves me with all her heart. However, I don't feel right, I've been self medicating to chase the feeling of excitement and tranquility without doing anything to deserve it. And that's it. I'm done. I don't wanna go back. I know there's a vaporizer sitting at home, resin just asking to be smoked, but I'm not going to give in to the urge to smoke. I'm sorry for all those I have hurt with my selfish desires.",9

Then we started talking about how we both know we need to quit. Then I said fuck I it, put all the weed away, and we never even smoked and that felt great. Then I made a pact with her that we need to stop (both of us having the intention of going back once we have lower tolerances). I downloaded an app called Quit Weed to help me and I figured I'd join this community to help as well...

However, I was reading through the terms and I saw this community wasn't for me because I had the intention of returning. But I think I have the intention of returning solely for the purpose of my addiction in my head telling me ""it's okay to go back, you had fun."" But I'm quitting just for now to truly better my life and also prove to myself I can go without it, but I'm afraid that if I start this journey strong and then toke up as a reward from a long break, then I'll just go back to smoking everyday, all day, which is so bad for me. This is seriously only day 1 so it might be jumping the gun, but this isn't also the 1st time I quit. I planned on joining the Air Force and quit just like that, but then when I was told because of my mental health issues that it wouldn't work, I was depressed, but then relieved that ""I don't have to quit anymore."" Then I started smoking HEAVY. And idk, I guess the whole point of this is that after reading some posts on this community, I realize this is a community I wanna be a part of. So what I'm really asking is 

1. How do I decide quit FOR GOOD, not just for a little bit?
2. Did any of you start with the intention of ""I'm gonna go back to smoking eventually"" but in turn were able to make the much harder choice of giving up for good?

Thanks for anyone who read this. It's honestly incredible to see so many people on this forum sticking with their goals and I wanna say thank you for sharing because I hope to use it as motivation not just to quit smoking for good one day but also as motivation for other things in life from the positive energy that is being spread on this forum.",4

I have been smoking weed since I was 15. It helped me through the bad times, the worse times, and made some of the good times ""more fun"".

I am not what most people would call a ""fuck up"" even though I see myself that way. I learned software engineering in about a month when I was late 17, that was the last time I had spent 1 month without smoking. I remember it well since I had the most intense dreams some nights of that month, crazy geometric shit and stuff. I have been smoking every day since then.

It has not impeded me from making bank, lots of money for little work, money that enabled me to take it to the next level. Since I was a kid I had always wanted a Storz and Bickel vape, got it. I always wanted moonrocks, could get that too. Hash, oil, crumble, sativa dominate, white widow, pineapple express, prerolls, oil-dipped, dabs, e-dabs, this, that, and the other thing, I could have it all now. That's how its been for the past 4 years of my life.
I eventually landed on the whole two half ounces (diff strains) a month plus a 1g pen for those times and a few prerolls for the occasion($300~ every 3/4 a month - a month). 

My work has definitely been impacted by it, but for whatever reason, I'm the only one that seems to notice it. I would smoke before meetings, standup, and just about anything I thought would bore me. I know I could be doing a lot more work, I mean A LOT more work, the problems are not hard at all. It's all just repetitive shit and sometimes something comes up that requires a little thinking then back to repetitive shit. A bunch of people on my old team would have a full-on 1-hour ""demo"" meetings after a group of 3 ""engineers"" would complete a tutorial and everyone would start clapping... The work is easy, there is a lot of it, but it's straight forward. For whatever reason, I am doing fantastic doing the BARE MINIMUM. I mean I would wake up at 9, get in at 10:30, read some stuff, go for lunch, watch some yt, listen to music while daydreaming, read some more stuff, go home, play games, smoke smoke smoke, and at around 1 am I would be like ""maybe some work now"" and just pick up a ticket, knock it out and then next morning at stand up just say yep that's what I did yesterday 100%.

The beginning of the year started rough cuz the company at which I worked at laid off all of its engineering force (400+ employees) (lol non-COVID relate was back in January) and I got a HUGE severance, I mean here I am a 21-year-old (back then) kid sitting on lots of pocket change. I mean shit I could not work for the whole year if I wanted to (lol again this is pre COVID). I got to level 60 in wow classic, I got to silver 1 in league (don't worry I'm back in s4 now), and I'm still a crack shot when it comes to cs like fps valorant. Then COVID started, isolation and yada yada, don't both me I was used to it, for a 'kid' in this day and age we kind of live on the internet, either through a slick youtube comment, a sick play, good times on discord, grinding ranked games, etc...we just are internet people,  that's how it is.

I recently got a new job, I was interested in this startup and joined it as a contractor. I've been ""working"" for 2 months now but smoking has not slowed down, but it has slowed me down. They are happy with my work even after telling them that I feel like I'm not doing good. Hell, they just extended a full-time offer with equity, which leads me to now.

Why the fuck am I writing this. TBH I don't know yet but I will say this. Weed is fine, it's not inherently bad, nothing is inherently bad, it's about dosage. Everything in moderation, some people can moderate, others can't. I can't do it, I just don't have something to do it for. Weed is such an odd drug, it makes everything you think about the ""moment"" you're in. You follow long thought-paths, that you can only flow in one direction, most of the time you won't remember what you were thinking about 2 seconds ago. It makes that moment feel purposeful, then as you start getting groggy, and it starts to fade, you quickly go for that other toke, cuz you want it to last. I want it to last, in never does.

My sister told me cold-turkey was not gonna work but I'm at a point where I think I don't have a choice. I MUST stop, not quit, I want to be able to just stop. I wake up in the morning tired/groggy, spend all day with an ""out of it"" state, and when I start getting into it is around 5 pm and take my first toke of the day lol. I want to go a whole month just focusing on my longterm plans and putting in good hours into a company that could benefit from it, and in return benefit me (equity). I'm also gonna get rid of my gear/bud, let a friend hold on to it for 2 weeks. This is gonna suck but whatever it must be done and if I don't do it I'll look like a fool on the internet, and who wants that to happen...so here goes nothing.

tl;dr: Longtime stoner/Software Engineer extraordinaire want's to stop smoking cuz it's holding him back from reaching Gold 4 in League of Legends. You won't believe what happens next!",1

I'm a new(ish) smoker and I have an addictive personality. 33 y/o female. Should I quit now?,"I smoked weed a handful of times in college. But, due to not always being in circles of people that had it, and little access to it overall due to it not being legal at the time (still isn't in LA), I never had the chance to get hooked on it. All I ever heard was, ""You can't get addicted to marijuana."" I'm assuming many of you have heard this before and possibly said it yourself to someone. Oh, how wrong they were. I started dating a guy who always had access (he was a chef) and we smoked together off and on, but he preferred drinking. I didn‚Äôt enjoy more than a hit or two of a joint. This was all during 2018. I remember having friends back then that would let their light bill go off so they could afford to buy weed and smoke all day every day, and thinking how sad that was. After I broke up with the chef, I got a job in Oregon. And moved up in Feb 2019. Before I moved, a friend in Oregon had sent me some prerolls and I treated them and savored them like gold. Tried to make them last. Once I arrived in Oregon, and within a week, walked into my first dispensary, it was over for me. I went from hitting a joint a couple times every weekend to hitting a joint 3 or 4 nights a week to a few times every night of the week before bed. Night turned to day (but only Saturdays - I rationalized.) As you might have guessed, it grew even more. This may sound like a lot to some and a small amount to others as I've only been smoking like this for a little over a year, but now I am at about a 1/2 gram a day. I have a bad habit of ordering online and having 6-7 1/2 gram prerolls delivered to me each weekend. I usually go through them by the following weekend. To make matters worse, I've been addicted to sugar and food in general in the past and work really hard to stay healthy and live a healthy lifestyle in spite of being a sugar addict. Not only have I become addicted to weed now, but, of course, it makes me want to eat and eat horrible things when I'm high. It's causing my other addiction to come back to the surface. I feel a lack of motivation, I've dropped out of school to get my PhD. I hide how often I smoke from my boyfriend, and my best friend/roommate is very aware of it. I can tell she's worried I smoke too much. I also have psoriatic arthritis. Anytime I flare, I smoke. PMS, I smoke. I smoke before a meal so it will taste better. I smoke before social gatherings. I smoke before a bath. I ABSOLUTELY cannot sleep now without smoking. When I have flown home for week long visits, and forced off of it, I couldn't eat or sleep and popped Ibuprofen PM every night while staying in my parents' home. My two brothers are also addicted, I should add. Our father is an addiction specialist and psychologist and he does not know, because we all live in 3 separate cities from our family. That adds an extra layer of guilt, as he literally has told us how dependent people can get on marijuana and sees it every day. There's a lot to unpack here. I feel scared and alone. I want to quit so badly, but just the idea of that gives me anxiety. It is absolutely a crutch, a pacifier. I thought posting here would be a good first step. I don't want to see where this will take me (or keep me from) years down the road. Any advice would help. Thank you!",19

I've spent years in a void of my own making, lost. Burying the embers of my self-loathing with weed. I moved away from home (from Asia) to London when I was 21, almost 8 years ago, and there it began. I have very few positive memories of the four to five years that followed after. Most of it was spent nervously shuffling through life, with little to no confidence and joy. It's easy to blame the weed, but it was clear that I was going through a crisis of sorts, far away from home with no family and friends, weed became my friend...my best friend. I felt burdened by my potential and often used weed to shut off from the rest of the world and learn my craft. In a sense it worked, I learnt a lot and am grateful for being disciplined in at least one way but I also lost so much. Between the years of 21 and 24 or 25 I barely even looked at a girl, let alone touched one. It's funny because that was so not my character but I suddenly became unable to keep up conversations, make eye contact or manage social occasions. This, coupled with pretty bad acne made me feel like I was not meant for this world. 

In 2016 I had a mental breakdown of sorts in a club in Berlin due to severe tinnitus. The following months were harrowing, to say the least, I refused to get treatment or medical help, and spent many days in a void of violent and self-harming thoughts. To make it worse, I consistently chain-smoked joints in some attempt to feel nothing, but all I did was amplify my sense of panic and lack of control. The tinnitus got worse the more stressed I became. I was stuck in a cycle. At this point I felt like an abject failure, I had only had shitty jobs and was isolated from my family and friends back home. Every time I stopped smoking, these incredible feelings of loathing, failure and guilt would rush towards me like a tidal wave. Five years of oppressed emotions can feel quite powerful. 

In 2016, at the age of 25, I started to work out for the first time and this was the greatest decision of my life. Two years later, I made my first attempt to stop smoking weed. I went for 2 months, but this was the first time I had ever not smoked since starting. It showed me that it was possible. My tinnitus got better, my confidence returned. I started dating a bit here and there. Unfortunately, I got complacent and started again. 

Last year I made my biggest attempt to date and managed to get to 6 months. During that time, my life changed dramatically, I got a good job, got pretty jacked, started dating, treated my acne. I made such massive strides that in retrospect, it's hard to believe. But of course, the little devil got into my head and made me believe I could handle it. The truth is to a degree I could, I can smoke and semi function, but it is by no means worth what you give up. Today, two days before my 29th birthday, I look back at my 20's and lament the amount of hatred I turned inwards towards myself, the number of things I gave up just to be able to smoke. I know one thing for sure today, no matter what happens, I will always fight this fight. No matter how many times I start, I will stop again. I will never allow myself to sink to those depths before, this lesson was too hard to forget. I would not be the person that I am today if I had continued with my weed consumption.

I implore all of you to look deep into yourselves with love and compassion. Everyone falls off the horse sometimes, help yourself to get back up. Look towards the future with positivity and hope, a life with a clear head feels like a life full of clear skies.

I have bipolar disorder. I just started a new job last week and I wanted to celebrate the relief I felt from being employed. So I bought a q from the dealer I used to frequent, brought it home and smoked a bowl. Immediately it was a rush that I had missed so much. And then another emotion came over me, intense regret. I knew that I had been more stable during the period I wasn‚Äôt smoking but that didn‚Äôt stop me from going back to an old habit.  It felt like the crutch I had used before for so long. But I realized that the pain I had numbed before with weed isn‚Äôt there as much when I don‚Äôt smoke. And my medication for the most part makes me feel balanced mentally. It is hard to change a lifestyle and to me that is what weed was, for better or for worse. I still have the rest of the bud I bought and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do with it yet.

I made it to 3 weeks with absolutely no cannabis usage, and to be honest I felt great for the most part.  Long story short, about 2 weeks ago I relapsed.  I had my own reasons and it was a well thought through (or so I believed) decision.  

Well after 2 weeks of smoking at least once a day, I can confidently say it was not a good decision.  I can see so clearly the benefits that I had from not smoking, and how they have melted away right back into my old self.  I‚Äôm not even really mad though, because the version of myself who was ‚Äúclean‚Äù is just so obviously better, that it makes the decision to quit again that much easier.  

I didn‚Äôt stay strong, but now it almost feels like a no brainer to stop for good.  I may have a bit here and there later on in my life, but as for personal usage of my own stash, that will never happen again.

Reading that note from 2013 made me so sad. That was 7 fucking years ago. I am dealing with the SAME issues as 7 years ago. Seven motherfucking years....

I have been feeling so depressed since I quit 9 days ago. I feel like this is it guys, I cannot go back. I'm turning 30 in 2 months. I cannot smoke daily again. It has fucked me and stifled my growth. I am tired of doing this over and over again and posting on this sub over and over and over again. How many times? This is it for me. 

Try and think about quitting as a life altering moment. For me, I entered a new phase of my life 9 days ago and it's that simple. I literally CANNOT go back. If I do, my depression will worsen and I'm scared I will fall down a black hole and could have irreversible repercussions. 

It's not about weed, it's about escaping issues and things that aren't easy in life. Weed is just the vehicle to do it. It could have been alcohol or food or sex or something. Not being sober is not a way to live.

The more I think about it, I feel that weed is the only thing I have some control over.  

I'm starting to practise the assertive techniques in the book and boy has it made a difference. I've got a lot off my chest to my wife, friends and family in a calm and assertive way without losing my shit and lighting up.  

When people say ""you need to get to the root cause of your addiction"" I thought they meant ""resolve your depression"".  

I think this has been contributing to my depression. Never having a say in anything. Being the shy, quiet, passive stoner who goes along with everything.

1. Your mind is going to RESIST & FIGHT this change, because smoking up is what your body knows ‚Äî its become a part of your identity, and thus a part of you, or so your mind thinks. You are in some way or another, attached. 

2. Perspective is everything. You need to adjust the track of your thoughts throughout life. YOU make a situation either negative, positive or just allow it to be as it is ‚Äî it‚Äôs all how you look at it.  Last night I couldn‚Äôt sleep for 3 hours. Typically, I would be irritated and upset at this, however, I instead embraced and accepted the situation I was in.  I told myself that this short term discomfort is for greater good, which makes it so much more worth it and tolerable for me. I got up and did something about it, I read for an hour and I‚Äôm pretty sure I fell asleep shortly after going back to bed at 2am. 

3. Even though I ended up sleeping only 5 hours, (which is fine for some LOL) I felt more energized and refreshed this morning than I have in a LONG time. 

4. I woke up HAPPY. I made it through the night and I used my perspective shift to ensure I didn‚Äôt allow myself to become negative or look at the situation as a ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing the night prior.

5. I feel more alert and in control of my emotions already. I feel I currently have control of my mind, it is not in control of me. I have reached a peaceful acceptance of whatever is to come. I won‚Äôt label situations as good/bad, I‚Äôll just allow them to be as they are. We try to change or resist so many things in life that aren‚Äôt even within our control and I believe this is the cause of great internal turmoil and pain.

Most of us are smoking to mask up some type of pain or trauma in life. However, once you truly accept what is (not labeling life situations as either good or bad, and allowing them to just be), great change and internal peace happens. Like I said earlier, it definitely won‚Äôt be easy, but it is most definitely simple. ;)

Today is day 1.

I've been smoking weed regularly for at least the last 3 years. I started off as a social smoker, would only smoke if I had other people to smoke with. I was pretty good at making sure that I wasn't smoking more than 2 or 3 days in a row and taking breaks, and I never used to get high by myself.

In 2018 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD, aka Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder/EUPD) and have been having trouble with my mental health since I was a child.

Early summer 2019 I had a drug-induced psychotic episode that lasted intensely for 3 weeks and had lasting effects for months before and afterwards. It happened because I didnt take my meds for 2 days and wasn't eating and was just smoking weed all day long. I was sectioned under the mental health act (Ireland) and held against my will for 2 weeks in a psych hospital. The entire charade was incredibly traumatic and left me basically unable to function. 

This time last year I admitted myself back into psych hospital. I was really depressed and finding it really difficult to wake up in the mornings or motivate myself to do anything. My doctor reccommended that I do a Drug and Alcohol Dependancy course. 

I hated every minute of the course. The group was mostly tackling alcohol and though they said to take what they were saying and apply it to your drug of choice, I never found any of it helpful. I felt like I was being forced to be sober, because the doctors said that if I got high ever again it could push me into psychosis and I may not be able to come out of it. 

During the day we had group therapy sessions and some of the slots were reserved for skills classes. I've done skills groups and therapy groups before (DBT to treat the BPD), but these slots were completely useless. One of the activities we did for an ENTIRE HOUR one day was to take the alphabet and write one positive word for each letter, the idea being that when we feel the urge to use we could take out this piece of paper and see some positive words.... 

I was looking forward to learning coping mechanisms for when I get the urge to smoke, so that I could have a system in place to stay sober. I felt bullied into forced sobriety, and I knew for a fact that when I came out of the program I was going to end up smoking again. 

I think I lasted a month after I came out of hospital. My girlfriend at the time was also a heavy weed smoker, and so are their friends who they lived with at the time. We ended up back in daily smoking, throwing all my plans for getting healthier out the window. We moved in together in February and during lockdown our routine became wake up in the morning, move from the bed to the couch, wake and bake, smoke all day, watch the same films and TV shows on repeat while playing computer games, eventually make some sort of crappy dinner (usually frozen pizza or a take away) and go back to bed. We essentially morphed into the same person, not functioning or creating the respective lives of our dreams. 

For the last 9 months I've been high almost every day. Over lockdown everything just fell apart. I didnt have a routine anyway before lockdown, but during lockdown everything got worse. 

I broke up with my girlfriend last week. Because we're both stuck in addiction, neither of us are actually living a healthy life and we're just comfortable being bored around each other. Neither of us are living the life we desire, and I cant hack it any more. Its gotten to the point where I always owe them money, about ‚Ç¨200 at this point. I'm unemployed bc of my mental illness and have no steady income and I rely on my parents for money and rent. It doesn't help that every spare money i get goes on weed. Even money that isn't spare goes on weed - I will sacrifice things that I actually need like groceries or petrol so I'll go without food or social interaction for the sake of some more green. A fifty euro note now just looks like a token for a bag of weed, instead of being a doorway to other activities.

For months now I've been trying to taper down my usage, I convinced myself (like many others here I've seen) that I would be able to smoke in moderation and that it if train myself off it gently I'll be able to achieve sobriety for a longer time. That line of thought has just kept me in active addiction while placating my guilt-ridden brain. 

I'm tired of half-trying and full-failing. I'm making a commitment now, in this public place, to be actively sober. I hope to look back at this post with more days under my belt and things are a bit easier. I know its going to be a challenge, but I also know that it's worth it. I'm worth it. 

I know that I'm going to miss being high. I enjoy the feeling, but I'm constantly chasing the feeling of being high that I cannot even feel anymore. I don't want to say that ill never get high again, because nobody knows what will happen in the future, but I am committing to sobriety right now in this moment.

So for day 1, thanks for reading and for creating this space. I really appreciate it - wish me luck!",5

It's an emotional roller-coaster. In all these weeks I've cried 3 times including today. But today I cried so intense and long and I haven't felt that way in years and what a relieve. When I smoked, I suppressed the feelings I had. But now I finally feel free. I'm back in school, am watching my food even better, working out even more and have more social contacts. 

I've become way stronger in the gym. But also my personality is changing back to what it was. Instead of sitting all day in my room baked af, I want to explore and meet new people. 

And if you're reading this having a hard time. 

Better days will come. This is my sixth attempt of quitting both weed and cigarettes. But this time, for me personally, it feels way different and way better. I'm glad to be free of these substances. 

I wish everyone here that is struggling all the best and positive energy in the world.

I was just wondering how this translates into action in your life. An obvious example would be that if someone offers you weed say no but what about more subtle defenses against using. What things do you do to stay clean? 

A less obvious example would be to allow yourself to indulge in instant gratification that is less harmful for you, say chocolate or tv series or sport if you're feeling stressed in order to keep the addict happy. Another one that comes to mind is to plan your week so as to minimize stress. Any other ideas?",1

My weed addiction has been messing my life up for 4 years now and I just need to stop so I can actually live my life, when I smoke i become super unproductive and literally lose passion for living and it just creates a negative depressive cycle that I need to get out of. 

1 month ago I met this absolutely amazing girl that has literally pulled me out my grave.. she‚Äôs made me realise that I‚Äôve been wasting so much time and how much I hate how I‚Äôm living now and for us too build a real future together I need to stop. We haven‚Äôt even stayed with each other over night yet because I‚Äôm scared of how I will feel without weed and it kills me that I‚Äôve been choosing a plant over staying with her. But tonight it changes.. she‚Äôs staying over tonight which is a big step for me, she‚Äôs fully aware of my situation and is super understanding and wants to do everything she can to support me. 

Genuinely I do think I‚Äôll be fine because when I‚Äôm with her I don‚Äôt even care about the weed. I‚Äôm still a bit worried/anxious of the withdrawal symptoms and I get negative intrusive thoughts that come from past negative experiences that do make me feel panicky and scared. 

The main reason I‚Äôm writing this is for support and guidance, if anyone can share their experience with quitting weed or give me advice to help get through the first days/weeks without it I would seriously appreciate it! Also if anyone is in a similar situation or is addicted to weed I wish you the absolute best! We can get through this! Big thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this.",39

2020-09-21 08:16:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iwz9mw/after_25_years_of_daily_pot_use_today_is_the_day/,"After 25 years of daily pot use, today is the day I quit - day 1","The first time I smoked pot I was about 14. I sought it out from my younger sis who went to art school. They stuffed the weed into the tube of a marker.

Fast forward 25 years. I appear to most to be a successful owner of an award wining business. And mom to a 4 and 6 year old. Well I‚Äôm also super ADHD and highly sensitive. This remote work remote school has put me over the deep end. I am not okay. I‚Äôm in debt, depressed, house is a mess and absolutely no one knows how much I smoke. 

I advocated myself into a 3 week mental health outpatient program (since regular therapy is not something my insurance offers). While intense, it left me feeling like ‚Äúgreat. Thanks for the new tools. But my adhd is kicking my ass and I‚Äôm crying all the damn time.‚Äù

I also learned a TON about adhd. When I learned that adhd is NOT a motivation problem and is NOT a problem of knowing what to do but it IS directly tied to dopamine in the brain and more to my point IS a working memory problem which makes it hard to hold ideas in working memory and turn them around and examine them. This makes looking back in time really really hard and looking into the future (foresight) virtually impossible. Well shit - pot and dopamine are connected too. And my working memory is very very diminished by weed. Time to stop throwing up extra hurdles for myself and paying tons of money to do it.

When I started that intensive program, I had also told the doctors that I smoke pot. So when I let her know two weeks ago that I think my adhd medication is wearing off early and could she prescribe more, she asked me to take a drug test to ensure that high thc levels aren‚Äôt a major contributing factor.

I mean I am a huge pothead. I don‚Äôt know why. I can‚Äôt get enough. I don‚Äôt even like how I feel most of the time.

When I crunched some numbers, I realized that my big income loss comes not from what I spend on weed (thousands per year   for decades) but on the lost work time when I could have been pulling In serious money for my company. 5 hrs per week is conservative.

I told her sure I‚Äôd take a drug test. But inside I was panicking. I didn‚Äôt make it in on Thursday and then my cat died and my area was clouded in forest fire smoke. I reached out and she said she‚Äôd prescribe a one months supply but note my account that they want to see thc levels before refilling it.

Let me be clear, I am quitting to take my life back. I am quitting so I can enjoy my kids more because I won‚Äôt be looking for my next hit all the time. I want more healthy habits that make me stronger. I want to help my kids through school eventually and finally start saving for retirement.

But the drug test was like the final nail in the coffin of the life where I was ashamed to be me because I have a precocious false self and fear of abandonment.

When I was about 5 I was zonked out after a night out seeing my mom in a play. my sister couldn‚Äôt sleep because her blanket was in my moms car at the community theater a mile down the road. My dad took her with him to pick it up and I was asleep in my bed until i woke. But where was my sister? Not in bed. My parents? Not in bed. Their cars? Both GONE!!!!! Oh my god my whole family picked up and left me in the middle of the night.

When they got home 10 minutes later I was inconsolable. I remember it viscerally. And them coming home and coming up the stairs to me sobbing. I almost remember it as if I was floating above watching it play out.

I do remember this but it is not something I think about a lot and it never occurred to me until about a month ago that it has impacted me ever since and this fear of abandonment has caused me to develop a false self that strives to be who you want me to be. I‚Äôm very good at it. It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs like wearing a mask so of course getting high or drinking would be a way to escape from all my expectations and my need to be someone other than my true self. I loved drinking Because I could let loose and stop trying to be perfect for everyone. And people loved me when I was drunk. They always told me how much fun I was. I would literally remember nothing. Blackout drunk was a way of life for my first year in college (22 years ago).

Then I moved to CA and it was on to harder drugs. I made it a point to try almost every drug once. Live it up right?

But even tho all my druggy friends are long gone and my partner doesn‚Äôt smoke - I still do. And since Covid and being home all the time - i smoke even more.

Well I‚Äôm living a double life and neither one is as rewarding as I know it could be if i could cut out my addictions and regain my ability to have foresight.

I‚Äôve been marinating in r/leaves all weekend. I realized I am not able to have pot around without abusing it. Yesterday I packed it all up and stuck on in a shelf. I‚Äôm ready.

No more weed for me. Not for a long time.

Let‚Äôs do this!

I just want to share with you guys that I'm one month clean. A lot of stuff has got better. The desire to use has disappeared almost entirely, I'm working out a lot, my life is a lot more structured and shit gets done. 

However, sobriety is tough. I see a lot of posts on here about how amazing people feel and it just gives the impression that it's easy. It's not and in my opinion it's important to be realistic about the difficulties of not smoking weed. If sobriety wasn't difficult it wouldn't be sobriety. We'd just be non-addicted people who would get on with their lives. We use for a lot of reasons and these begin to surface as our journey into sobriety unfolds. My obsessions are through the roof, I regret all the time I wasted while using, I resent people who aren't addicted or that can smoke without it messing up their lives, I have to work on myself a lot, I have to avoid certain places and people I like, I'm irritable and I treat people around me like shit sometimes, navigating the challenges of daily life without weed is hard and I have to face the fact there are a lot of things about my life and myself I don't like. 

Anyway, sobriety isn't easy. It's a lot of work and there's a lot of pain involved but it's definitely worth it. I'm sick and tired of relying on it as a crutch and I'm willing to put in the work. Also trying to have me some clean fun. Sex with my partner, eating food I like, getting that endorphine high from sport and just generally goofing around.",18

What i‚Äôve learned so far and my improvements.,"So im posting this today instead of tomorrow because I work and I haven‚Äôt posted in awhile and i want to get this out there, for anyone who cares.

After a month of willingly not smoking weed (after about 5-6 years of smoking), my life has improved so much. Just within a month. I‚Äôm not anxious in social situations anymore, i don‚Äôt overthink before i do. My head isn‚Äôt filled up with paranoid or depressive thoughts like its always has been. Just overall I feel like my mental health is on the right path to going back to my pre-smoking self. Its funny because I started smoking to improve my mental health.

Most importantly to me however are these two improvements: 

Finally after the 5-6 years (its honestly a blur of when i first started) my savings account reached $1000 again. I not just have money to spend, I actually have money saved so I‚Äôm not all stressed when something happens to my car or any other emergency arises that i cant do anything about because i blew all of my money on weed.

And my relationship with my family is back. I dont need to lie, sneak around, or trick my parents anymore. While i smoked my relationship with them was so strained for the longest and im glad everything is going back to the way it was.

Heres 3 important lessons I‚Äôve learned after this month too:

- Weed friends are NOT your true friends. Ive maybe got 4 true friends after ive stopped compared to the endless stoner ‚Äúfriends‚Äù i had.

- It gets easier saying NO with practice. If you‚Äôre not telling your friends that still smoke NO early on, the harder it will be when the first situation arises where you have too.

- its all in your willpower. Stopping weed is a push to improve yourself, but I needed to use that push instead of laying around and hoping for these benefits to magically appear. Stopping weed took the weight off my chest that locked me to the bed, but I had to be the one to bring myself up and be the person i wanted to be.

So thats about it, i didnt want to type a whole boring novel so thats why I just chose 3. I hope this post inspires someone to quit and/or inspires someone to keep going. Good luck out there!",13

You know, the one thing that gives me that feeling of finishing at the end of the day.




The problem however is, that this feeling is still there the next morning. I still feel tired, not focused, almost like an open wound.


I can't concentrate, I feel sad and soon as I feel this way, my thoughts shift to weed consumption.



However, when I buy and smoke it, it just doesn't give me that feeling of being able to deal with stuff.


I mean yes, the first joint gives me a euphoric feeling, but after that?

Even when I'm high I am aware of all the struggle I have in my life right now. Being high doesn't remove these issues, no, it actually makes them worse because it puts me in a mental state of dreaming, of not committing, of standing in between.



Weed makes me accept a lot of things and I realized that during the last few months, my behaviour of procrastination and avoiding has reached it's peak, so did my weed consumption.




I know that there is only one way out for me, and this is by quitting right now, saving some money again, finding a job that I like and finally bring some order into my life.


Continuing with weed will get me nowhere except maybe even worse places.


All that money I've spend that wasn't even supposed to be used for weed but for food and clothes instead.. I feel so fucking guilty, how could I even let this come so far?



I will take this day by day because not only do I need to, I want to.

I want to finally be able to get some control in my life and especially make my family happy and proud again, make myself proud again so I finally feel like I am achieving something again.",6

Weed may not be a bad thing, but to certain people as myself and all of you hear reading this, it makes us feel like we don‚Äôt have control nor do we want control of our lives when we are high.  The constant urge to just want to smoke whenever a problem arises in life instead of tackling it like we should.

Today is my 22nd day of no weed. No THC or even CBD in any form. This has honestly been so so fucking hard, I got dumped a week ago a few days before our 2 year anniversary and all I wanted to do is smoke and numb the pain. On top of that I've been dealing with some gnarly health issues and missed a month of work. The last few weeks have been some of the darkest in my life but I STILL DIDN'T SMOKE! People don't really care or understand how hard it's been. They think, oh it's just weed. Cool glad you stopped smoking. But I was high every waking moment for years, on dabs, flower, edibles, you name it, I consumed it. I work at a legal weed store, I'm surrounded by it and sell it to customers all day long, and it's my first week back... STILL HAVEN'T SMOKED! It's a big deal to me and I'm so proud of myself and so happy I got this far. My mental and physical health is still in shambles at the moment, but I'm free of that addiction and can move forward in healing all aspects of my life. Of course I WANT to fucking smoke, my heart is broken into a million pieces, but my resolve at this point is pretty strong. I've also noticed my general anxiety about everything is lessening each day. Just wanted to share because I need someone else to understand how hard it is, and know that you can do it too.

I told her I‚Äôve been smoking and she asked me if i do everyday and i lied and said no. I hate myself for lying to my parents about it. I really don‚Äôt want to stop smoking, I love it. I love getting high, it‚Äôs my favorite feeling and i‚Äôm not ready to let it go. I‚Äôm craving it so badly right now. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm depressed and sick and already feel the withdrawal symptoms. I feel so guilty for lying to my mom too.",14

It feels great to not have a strong itch to want to smoke as I did when I was smoking daily and it‚Äôs nice to not have to spend money weekly for this habit but it doesn‚Äôt feel like quitting weed has dramatically changed my life in the way it seems for others. 

My productivity feels more or less the same except now I‚Äôm not high while doing my hobbies. I guess I‚Äôm just wishing that quitting would‚Äôve given me a ton of energy to do more and regulate my sleep better but the only positive that I really see is that I have money to spend on other things like fancier clothes. Not sure what else I can make of this so far. I miss smoking but I feel guilty if I break my streak and would not want to become a daily vaper again because I don‚Äôt want to spend money on a temporary high when I can save it for the future or spend it on something permanent 

I quit smoking when the pandemic began because I got pneumonia and I‚Äôm proud that I have been able to stay sober while on lockdown at home all day when I used to have the tendency to smoke on my regular more busy schedule and it feels good to not have some kind of dependency but idk I guess I‚Äôm just feeling like weed didn‚Äôt have that big of an impact on my personality or habits üòï",20

2020-09-20 19:50:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iwp97w/1_week_clean_heres_what_i_learned/,1 week clean - Here's what I learned,"I've had a cyclical cycle of quitting over the past few years, during which I have gone months to a full year of quitting. However, I had always found my way back to an addictive pattern of abusing weed on a daily basis with zero self control.

This has been my 5th attempt at quitting and here's what I learned so far after 1 week of staying sober.  I am only sharing this in case it helps someone who is struggling to quit or feels hopeless.

&#x200B;

**BENEFITS:**

\- **More energy, clarity and focus** to complete tasks without telling myself 'I'll do it later' because I want to get high

\- **Money saved** (I would spend at least a minimum of $40-80 a week on dry herb/edibles)

\- **Reduced anxiety and fear of generally having to work** (I WFH due to COVID in a corporate job and looked forward to the 5:00pm mark everyday so I could get high and enjoy my few hours of freedom after work. I am now using this time to exercise, study and also game to keep me productive and occupied)

\- **Emotional Re-balance** (It is quite evident that living under the mask of being high shields you from feeling emotions and thoughts that you would have to face head on if you were sober. We naturally identify these as 'bad/negative' emotions, but honestly, they are a part of life that we NEED to experience as humans to grow and evolve ourselves. I cried like a baby in the shower a few days ago while listening to classical music and thinking about the all the loss of close family in the past few years. It felt amazing and I felt relieved and so in tune with being alive..sounds strange doesn't it?..but this is exactly the thing you should be doing to handle grief..not getting high daily)

\- **Increased awareness**. It's only been a week and I am already more in tune with my surroundings and a much sharper person than I was a week before. I am also a naturally intelligent person and I don't say this to kiss my own ass. However, my drawbacks in life have been due to me having super insane anxiety and always feeling second to others because of a speech impediment. The act of getting high is actually subconsciously telling me that I feel sorry for myself and that I deserve to feel this way (high) as a reward for the suffering (that I believe) I face in life. I can't do this shit any more and that is why I am on this path again and will continue to stay on it.

**- Better sleep**. I feel more rested and recharged after I sleep. I know a lot of people say they have symptoms when they quit cold turkey related to poor sleep/sweats, but this was probably the case for me during the first 2 days. I am a lot better now and sleep like a baby. Crazy/vivid dreams are there for sure, but these will go away with time. Also, I actually really like these dreams as I'm super deep into subconscious/mind stuff.

**- Significantly improved self control.** I stopped munching and eating shit just because it ""tasted good"" while high. This is such a killer and people don't realize how much long term damage we are doing to ourselves.

**DRAWBACKS:**

\- None

We can all do this. Weed is not meant to be abused for daily/recreational use. The reason why most of us are here is because we have ZERO to little self control and this applies to other things and not just weed. If this is something you recognized about yourself, I am sorry to say, but the only path to living the life you want is to quit weed. My approach before was to treat myself by getting high on weekends/once a week etc, but the second I did that - I got addicted again and again and again.

We can all make it. No matter what you struggle or deal with, you have to overcome it to master yourself and live a fulfilling life. You can run away from your problems, but the problems will still be there. The moment you make the conscious decision to quit and stick with it, is the moment you look your problem in the face and step over it. Good luck guys.",62

I finally quit over a year ago (1yr 4 months!) and I am the happiest I have ever been. It was hard, and **improvement was slow**, but I got there.

I feel like a new person now. I have so much more energy, motivation, and confidence. My memory is better, and most importantly I do not hate myself. (Self-hate *started* to disappear around the 6 month mark for me).

Tomorrow I start a new job and in a few weeks I move to a new city. I'm nervous and stressed, but also excited and confident that I can handle all this. 

I am starting a new chapter in my life and I feel like being sober this last year+ has prepared me well for this moment. If I was still smoking daily I probably wouldn't have even applied for this job, and I would be incredibly overwhelmed by all the changes.

Quitting is not easy, but I promise you it gets easier!

I really want to quit because I have goals and dreams that have always come second to getting high

I don‚Äôt believe weed is a ‚Äúgateway drug‚Äù for everyone but for me it was. I‚Äôve done so many drugs but weed was the one that caught me in addiction. Some people can smoke and be successful but for me, I can smoke and get by (think low grades, maintaining a minimum wage job).

So I had no idea it was marijuana withdrawal, cried for what seemed like a week straight waiting for covid test results which my anxiety convinced me I had (negative result). Went to the doctor and she said maybe quitting weed was the culprit. Which blew my mind cause it was 2 weeks later. Got blood tests anyway cause I was hysterical crying in the office and she just wanted to make me feel at ease. Nothing wrong there. It's been 7 weeks since I ""quit""...  I'm in week 5 of withdrawals but more like 3 cause I slipped and smoked 1 night. I still feel nauseous, confused, blurry eyed, dizzy, crying, paranoia, feeling like I'm burning up sometimes.

I‚Äôve tried to quit before but always failed after a few days. Due to the subreddit I‚Äôm reading about people with a similar story and it appears this does the trick for me. Apart from the occasional associations that are still in my mind (passing the house of my dealer for example) i‚Äôm not tempted the slightest right now just because I can finally see the difference between living with weed and without it. Apart from getting actual REM-sleep I notice some other positive effects: it might be a stupid example but I have two staircases in my apartment: I used to always take one step at a time apart from when being in a rush. Now taking two steps standard. This sums it up for the rest: I have a pretty high functioning project management job - even after a week the results are so noticeable. I can think out ideas within a few minutes where I used to just do a project and go from there. Another difference I notice is my experience with music and TV: it might be a contradiction but I seem to enjoy music again on a level I haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy in the last four years. TV seems to have more color and a different layer in series and films is noticeable. One last anecdote before I stop rambling: I went out last night and had an amazing time with friends. My best (female) friend texted me this morning all of her friends said that I look very good and ‚Äòdateable‚Äô - this might not be the consequence of quiting for a week but all these positive vibes are creating a wave / snowball effect and I‚Äôm loving it. And that‚Äôs only after one week. I wanna thank everyone on this subreddit for sharing their stories. I‚Äôve seen some people with withdrawal symptoms that aren‚Äôt positive at all but I‚Äôve been trough most of them during previous failed attempts to quit. This time I barely feel any of them and I hope everyone struggling gets to the point where I‚Äôm at right now. It gets better and is worth it 100%. I‚Äôve posted this line a few times already but I keep coming back to it: it‚Äôs better to feel pain, than nothing at all (the opposite of love is indifference).

It was a sativa thc edible and it ruined me. The entire experience was overwhelming in which I felt extreme head pressure and had no motor skills for many hours. Perhaps it was awful because I don‚Äôt have a tolerance. 

After that, I experienced terrible anxiety and my family had no idea on how to console me. Then I continued to have head pressure, headaches, migraines, loss of appetite, and some nausea.

This throws off the rest of my day and it makes me lazy. Then around 10pm I will smoke again and wake up somewhat hung over the next day.

I am looking to do a 180 change on my life. Any tips from people who have quit or those who are in the process of quitting. 

I currently just hit my nic like 20 times and then threw it out my window to be seen again. I was so buzzed I just threw up so I think that is the perfect was to call it quits.

Some takeaways and venting:,"You revert to a simp lizard-brain status. I most likely smoked again because I value so much the feeling of cracking jokes with my friends but of course I'm absolutely more articulate and speaking truer thoughts when I'm sober, my clarity of mind had been something I really savored during abstinence but then after smoking Im just sitting there kinda desperately grasping for though on the inside but just slack-jawed on the outside.

So I smoked weed again and all I got was this lousy headache. Not to mention shortness of breath. I had been convinced I was super susceptible to allergens in my area when I was smoking everyday but once I quit I realized that was false. It all came rushing back though- sniffles and shortness of breath- after I took just one hit. I drove back home with a headache and nausea which in hindsight Im kinda thankful for for repulsion's sake. 

Pot is the last to go, concerning mind-altering substances (Unless you count caffeine which I also have plans to drop.) Alcohol was my DOC which I successfully quit in 2018 after a 5-year binge so I feel confident in that I have a lot of tools I use to keep me clean and to have convinced myself that booze is the antichrist. Though yesterday it also happened that I consumed a small amount of wine (not drank) in a dish that my friend prepared but failed to properly cook down all the way so I ended up with a forkful of chicken  with sauce that just tasted like bubbly and made me feel warm around the ears. I've forgiven him and he expressed real regret but the incident probably catalyzed the thought process towards getting stoned so needless to say yesterday was kinda rough for my sobriety journey but I dont anticipate much difficulty getting back on the wagon (off the wagon?)

I have two children who are my life's loves so everything and anything I do is with them in mind. Pot always made me less patient with them oddly enough, you can still be a slackjaw stoner and have a short temper with your kin. I know they see the difference in me between a month-off-pot and before when I would smoke all day because now I have natural dopamine-surges and they are geberally more happy and well-behaved too. But they are also just getting bigger.

If anyone is struggling with quitting then some sage tips I kept near and dear is to form a good environment free from the pot, paraphernalia, etc. Social situations are hard but Ive made a rule to myself only to hang out if theres like some kind of physical activity or hobby going on such as running together, rock climbing, band practice. Exercise is paramount, but try to find a sport specifically. Something you can track progress with in units that isnt just lbs. or body composition. Feel free to reward yourself in ways besides smoking like cake or something if thats what it takes. The biggest thing is shaping your internal monologue to instilling a confidence in yourself that looks at your DOC with scorn and malice and knows that your sober brain deserves so much, so much better.

I understand this came out to more of a rant than anything, I just really don't mesh with 12-step and I haven't many companions who are on the same path as I am. My kids are only 2 and 5, my friends still smoke and drink like they're invincible and so does my girlfriend/ baby mama, but I love her dearly and she doesnt have a full-fledged problem like I did. So just don't relapse! Haw. Its totally not worth it and euphoric-recall is a term that many rehab groups use to describe the nostalgia that precedes cravings. Dont trust it! Your brain is so beautiful, but your past addict is still renting a room in there making an awful racket too. You should expect it to be there for awhile and expect periodic battles until one day you've noticed you've gone the past week without real bona fide cravings, and experience gratitude from this.",7

I was born in a small city in a country in Eastern Europe and have had a pretty harsh childhood as my parents weren't earning much. All I remember from my childhood is a strong urge to provide for my family and make them feel loved. The low income lasted till I was around 12 years old, about the same time I started playing bass and guitar. 

My worries started fading away and were replaced with a big passion for music, I loved playing guitar and started ""touring"" with my band around the country around the age of 15.

I finished high school and like all the kids my age(18-19 years old), I had to leave the city and get a college degree. I thought I'd make a living with my guitar but life didn't go as planned, so I started smoking weed.

I started business school, but quit after a couple of months because I didn't feel I belonged there. I didn't tell my parents and got a job to save money for an audio engineering program.

I managed to save enough money and started studying audio engineering. I thought my life was nearly completed. Every course was pure joy, I was smoking weed and had no worries at all. I was waiting to finish the year so I can get my diploma and get a nice, well-paid job.

Struggled for 2 years to find a job and I failed, so I had to get a random, stressful job a corporation. All I did was work for about 10 hours, come home to smoke weed and play some video games; that was (and still is) the only thing I enjoy doing. After one year of working there, I couldn't take it anymore. The calls I had to answer were too stressful, the weed wouldn't get me high anymore and the money I was spending on it was ridiculous (more than half my income).

I decided to go live with my parents for a couple of months and start over with my girlfriend. The only thing that didn't change this whole time is the weed smoking habit.

There's not a single day that goes by without me smoking some joints.. I do have many hobbies, but they all go better with a couple of spliffs and I rarely grab my guitar without rolling.

Some friends think it's alright, some say I smoke way too much (1-3 grams a day); all I know is I'm pretty addicted and I need to do something about it. Any advice? Would love to hear your stories.

Tldr: Been pursuing my dream for a long time; I believe weed is my big stepping stone but I'm severely addicted. Would like to hear your story about how you managed to quit.",1

Long story short I'm 56 years old and I started smoking weed when I was 12 years old and I also did a hell of a lot of other drugs. Started blacking out from drinking at the age of 12. Quit doing all of these things in 1988.

I had literally about 23 years clean in 2010 or 11. But to be quite honest I really didn't have all that clean time because I was acting out in a very very dark way and had another addiction that was behavior based that could have gotten me killed very violently probably even.

This is what's known as addiction hopping or addiction substitution don't fall into that trap. 

Also throughout all those 23 years I was still smoking cigarettes as well as my behavior-based addiction. Then in 2011 I decided that I was retired from the military and I had no professional obligations that it was time for me to start self-medicating with medical marijuana.

I mean I was diagnosed with PTSD so you know of course I have to smoke weed. I had access to some of the best weed and buds anyone can imagine.

To be honest I could look at a huge picture of a beautiful bud and probably ejaculate from it.

Even now I can't 
t look at images of flower.
So from 2011 until about 101 days ago I was I was smoking and smoking and smoking. then I would quit for a while couple of months six months one time even a year and then everything was good.

At the start of kovid things got really out of hand.

But I came to realize it's just emptiness. And not the same kind of emptiness.

So now at 101 days I can say I'm 100% clean and abstinent and recovering from the incessant desire to pursue sense pleasures of any kind.

Be at food drugs chemicals substances cigarettes self harm sexual addiction porn addiction video game addiction any kind of sense pleasure that will lead me to an addictive slave like mentality

I know this Reddit is all about weed and I totally respect that as well as the rules and the moderator but just remember this man addiction is addiction it's all the same side of the same coin do not turn your back on addiction because it's like whack-a-mole you'll always try to find a way to self-medicate with something or someone somehow I love you all don't be a slave we are not slaves take those chains off man",11

But giving in won't relieve you of your anguish. Here's my timeline for withdrawal, and the danger zones that I'm struggling to overcome.  

1-7 days - general feelings of apathy, insomnia, nightsweats, no appetite, anxiety, generally wanting to hide away.  

7-14 days - a slight improvement of symptoms. The pink cloud. ""Yes - I've defeated it"". I promise myself never to go through that hell again. I usually start waking up very early around this point and I feel 'wired' during the day.

14-90 days - general ups and downs, severe apathy, anxiety and depression. I almost forget that it's my cannabis abuse that caused all of this. Sleep gradually returns to normal. Dreams are very vivid and surreal. Nightmares are a regular occurance.

90 day - 6 months - God mode. Confidence is back, no social anxiety, lots of exercising, outperforming my standards at work. Life is great again.  

6 months + is the danger zone. I forget, I relapse, I repeat. This cycle has gone on for many years.  

Now, I'm not anti Cannabis. Some people don't get this cycle and that's fine. But my physiology and psychology do not mix well with Cannabinoids. Faulty genes? Early exposure? Who knows. Who cares??

Thank you for making such a big community to help people like me quit smoking weed, I first started smoking on December 2019 and it was okay since that until last month I smoked every day and that's when I started to notice that I have no motivation to do anything except for work and just come home and lay down thinking if I should smoke or not, and I always end up smoking. I'm 23 years old, I'm a math student doing my master's, and focusing on studies has been hard too... I find myself easily distracted...   
 I want to quit and as I'm reading people's posts about how they did it or the process of doing it is really motivating, already a good sign that I can still feel motivated about something.

Just reached 9 days into quitting nicotine (4 yrs) and bud (2 year, every day). I went cold turkey on both and got hit with double the symptoms, and I have been having the worst anxiety, heart palpitations, headaches, and irritability. I used to smoke ~1.5 grams a day and i never realized just how much I depended on it to sleep. 

Last night was the first night I didn‚Äôt toss and turn or suddenly jolt out of bed, thinking my heart had skipped a beat. It was also the first night I didn‚Äôt have dreams.

But last night I finally got an uninterrupted, easy, completely solid 8 hours of sleep. I feel great!

It gives you a natural high to replace the hole left behind by weed and eases withdrawal symptoms significantly.,"If you are a chronic smoker struggling to quit weed, I want you to try deadlifting or any other powerlifting movement of your choice. While powerlifting has many benefits I want you to ignore all of the ones you typically associate with weightlifting and use it solely as a tool for breaking marijuana addiction for three reasons.

1. Deadlifting will give you a massive adrenaline/endorphin high that will replace the marijuana high with one that makes you feel better and most importantly you still had to work for. This also has a large number of psychological effects that will help your brain heal from constant substance abuse.
2. Deadlifting will increase your appetite massively and will make you have a good relationship with food.
3. Most importantly, deadlifting is an amazing sleeping aid. It is more effective for sleep than melatonin and even weed. You will sleep early and you will sleep sounder. Good sleep is necessary in so many ways to combat weed addiction and weed withdrawals.

Finally, I just want to say that I hope everyone that is struggling with marijuana can find a way to get sober. I am rooting for you all and I know how difficult it can be. Please comment with any questions or concerns.

Edit: If you are going to deadlift, please do a good amount of research on how they are performed correctly and start slow. Do not try to hit your personal best immediately. Depending on your fitness level you may need to gain a certain level of flexibility in order to do them correctly. I don't think you should be performing deadlifts unless you can touch your toes. Please be careful when doing any exercise and always be mindful of warming up and pushing yourself safely.",389

I would have to say that the highlight of the journey was the relationship, because I was so astonished of my newfound ability to communicate and be unselfish and present.  It was a real connection of mind body and soul.  I was sad it had to end. 

Also there is no way I could possibly perform my job were I not sober as a bell.  Thats been a highlight I suppose, just honest blue-collar day-to-day reality, hot coffee and affirmations in the morning, meditation before bed at night..

I‚Äôve been a consistent smoker for two years and felt that I had lost my fire and my edge (also quarantine didn‚Äôt help as well as other circumstances) and I guess I was right. I‚Äôve been doing boxing for a month now and my cardio has really improved, and I feel more focused but I just feel like I‚Äôm experiencing more mental pain.

He still invites me to some things but I just don‚Äôt feel like going anymore. On one hand I got bored of doing the same things and also I just feel like I don‚Äôt want to spend time doing things that I don‚Äôt want to do.

I just feel emotions a lot more intensely now and I‚Äôm still social at work and I talk to some people at the boxing gym so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm completely isolated.

Im only 5 days sober and was expecting the withdrawal process to be very uncomfortable and difficult. Here is the weird part though. I havent craved weed not even at all in the slightest bit. Keep in mind I was a daily user and would smoke multiple times a day. I had loss of appetite for about 2 days but it has seemed to come back. The only other withdrawal symptoms I've had is very vivid dreams (not necessarily a bad thing). I've been able to sleep every night so I dont have insomnia like many people do. I've been bored more but thats expected. I even went over to a friend's house  yesterday(they all smoke weed) and it was all around me. I even passed the joint around when it was handed to me and I didn't even puff it (didn't even want to)
 The 5 day ago me would have definitely smoked it without thinking twice. Im not trying to brag or whatever by any means. Im just curious if anybody else has had a  relatively easy withdrawal process? I know im only 5 days clean which is nothing in the grand scheme of things but I honestly don't see myself smoking weed for a very long time (or maybe never again).

Of course, I've done all the obvious (walks, jogging, yoga) but today I tried video games again. I was nervous because I thought if I felt bored, it would give me reason to relapse but I started with something simple (minecraft). I started at 11am and before I knew it, it was 3pm. I was having a good time just creating and letting my imagination break free. I've been reading more lately, and even got back into coloring. It seems cheesy or childish but honestly, it feels really great to just feel imaginative again. Yes have been bouts of restlessness and boredom but when I get a craving or urge I just remind myself of how boring and bland I felt. I used to use weed as a way to enhance the fun, and got to the point where the fun WAS smoking. Games were boring because it cut into smoke time. Even now, just watching sports, I'm more engaged. No real point to this post other than to update, check-in and tell anyone reading this YOU WILL REACH THIS POINT! MAYBE AFTER 3 DAYS, 3 WEEKS OR EVEN 3 MONTHS BUT DON'T GIVE UP. YOU WILL NOT REGRET QUITTING BUT YOU MIGHT REGRET RELAPSING. WE GOT THIS! 

Have a great night all!",8

After about 2,5 weeks I had the emotional up, that naive-me had seen as ""now it will always be like this"". Boy was I wrong. It lasted for four days, before I felt it slowly go away. A deep sadness creeped towards me, growing every day a bit more, until that ""up"" was completely replaced by it. It lasted longer. After about 1,5 weeks I needed a pause from the people surrounding me. Almost all of the sadness was paired to my flatmates. I messaged my sister if I could move into her flat for a few days. Luckily she said yes. She lives there with two friends and her bf. All completely great human beeings. I felt very welcome there, as I stayed for two weeks. In this two weeks with almost no contact to my own flatmates (exept for some messages) I learned to be myself again.

This time quitting has been different than previous times and probably not similar to your story. I quit when I was feeling really sick, so I kinda took that as a moment to advantage off. Actually, the first week was easy and without a lot of cravings.

But a few days ago I failed an important exam for the third time and ever since then I feel like I've been such a mess. Crazy moodswings. Getting upset over trivial things. No control over emotions. Just thinking I'm such a loser and a failure in life, really, really makes me want to smoke again.

Since Monday, I've had a drink every night to calm my nerves. It's just one drink but I know it's not a good thing to do. But I don't know how else to calm down. 

And this weekend I'm working and will be staying in the city where I was stoned 24/7 and I'm scared I might break orsomething. I know weed doesn't fix anything but I need that dopamine. I just want to feel relaxed.

What i spend
$80 / week

Hours worked to earn that money
4 hrs / week
208 hrs / yr

Hours of missed work during the day due to getting high
1 hr / day
Not working on income work so lost revenue at $50/hr 5 days per week
$250 / week
$13,000 / yr

$17,000/yr for 10 years is 170k. I could easily pay off my debt, put the kids through (community) college, take several sweet vacations and be saving for retirement. I mean...?!!

Without breaking a sweat I could probably pull in an extra quarter million dollars in the next 20 years if nothing changed in my life.

Do I want to say yes to taking a hit off the Vape pen or do I want to say yes to a quarter million dollars and more quality time with my kids?

Not only that, but just that $300 a month put towards somebody to help organize, or clean or assist me in doing the things that I like the least, that could free me up in immeasurable ways. Or if I spent that money on self care. Fuck.

Then he picked up more of his stoner friends and I remebered why I stopped. They looked skinny and unhealthy while I‚Äôm decently big and strong and much healthier. They were only talking about drugs which I hated. I got so bored of just talking about weed. They were talking about how they don‚Äôt have money and shit and I been able to save up over $7000 thx to my parents not letting me have access because they knew I would spend that shit on drugs, I just keep working at my job and they save for me. I‚Äôm motivated and started a business and been working out I can bench 225 for reps at 165 lbs. I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve gone and I‚Äôm proud I didn‚Äôt do anything I would regret but that temptation still haunts me.

Packed away are all the herbs, the gadgets, the memories. At one time I thought this would be a good way to relieve pain and pass time pleasantly. I never once got giggly or lost control, on the contrary I would become a lofty thinker and gain motivation. I thought I had found a missing piece of myself, a fragment of who I am that happened to be located outside of my body.

But now, it‚Äôs in a locked drawer. I found that the pain relief and passing time came at costs. My first lesson in economics could be summed up as ‚Äòthere is no free lunch‚Äô and my final lesson in drug reliance was that ‚Äòthere is no free lunch‚Äô. Lofty thinking became clouded judgment, limited perspective, and anxiety. Motivation gained became unactionable. Overall I became dulled, edgy, and prone to mood swings. The things I enjoyed became distant memories as I took deep breathes of sharp air infused with vapor or smoke. It stopped working but I kept going anyway because after all this was my identity, right? 

Things changed. The truth is that it just stopped being enticing. I realized that I wasn‚Äôt having fun anymore. Every time I‚Äôve tried to quit in the past I clung to the memories of the fun times, the deep introspective times. But I finally realized that those days have past, like the childhood I left behind long ago. It felt like falling out of love, realizing that you can live a better life without the lover or loved one whom jilted you. So I put my hobby into a drawer, locked it, and walked away.",7

After many MANY attempts at quitting in coping with cannabis, (you can see from a former post I made on here that it clearly didn‚Äôt last) I‚Äôve finally made the firm decision to quit for good.
Maybe at a different time in my life I could do it regularly, but as of now I don‚Äôt even need to do it occasionally as that tends to lead to daily use again.

I‚Äôd been indulging in cannabis use for almost 9 years and it made me feel so badly, for so long.
I learned to cope unhealthily with it, so much.
Even when it got to the point of making me unmotivated, more depressed, and consumed with stress and anxiety.

Those weed hangovers, they were serious. They made me such a huge ball of stress. I would awaken in the morning after a night of heavy toking, consumed with anxiety. So much stress. So many bad thoughts. So much anxiety almost to the point of feeling paralyzed as I would lay in my bed.

Using cannabis can have its advantages, but if I‚Äôm being honest I abused it. I got reliant on it to feel ‚Äúokay‚Äù.

Now, I‚Äôm only on day four‚Äî but I feel more alive that I‚Äôd felt in YEARS. I am getting back into studying, doing things I‚Äôm passionate about, eating better, and working out. I don‚Äôt constantly want to be asleep or to order delivery lol.

I feel happiness and peace again.
I feel blessed.

I just want to say thank you to every single person on here. I wouldn‚Äôt be making this post if it weren‚Äôt for you.
You people are such extraordinary people and you‚Äôve helped motivate me to get this point.


I downloaded that grounded app to track my progress. I would highly recommend to anyone who‚Äôs quit or quitting! It‚Äôs neat! It tracks how many days you‚Äôve been without smoking and the further you get the more the acorn grows from an acorn to a tree! It‚Äôs a beautiful symbolism. 

I hope you all have a splendid day! You deserve it! ü¶ã",5

In my prior attempts to quit, made it a week, maybe a month. I'm really trying to focus on ODAAT, focus on just making it today, and not thinking about a week, a month, let alone a year. Cravings have been intense, so I stowed it far out of reach. 

Listening to calming music, meditating, letting myself have candy for breakfast to get some dopamine, keeping busy, reaching to sober support, and taking (prescribed) anxiety meds. What's your advice? Anything you'd recommend reading? Any videos worth watching?

So far, there hasn‚Äôt been much change, however, things changed! The good sides are

‚Ä¢ Theres so much more time in a day now.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm more aware of what i‚Äôm eating.
‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt mindlessly play video games for hours
‚Ä¢ I have been posting on social media again! (No longer self conscious about what I post)
‚Ä¢ I dont have the urge to masturbate. (Weed was always followed by fapping for me)
‚Ä¢ I deep cleaned my room.
‚Ä¢ Ive been to the gym EVERYDAY these last 3 days.
‚Ä¢ My girlfriend hasn‚Äôt gotten mad at me for anything.
‚Ä¢ And i‚Äôm more social.

Only two symptoms i‚Äôm experiencing hard:

‚Ä¢ Can‚Äôt sleep (Slept a total of 6 hours these last 3 days)
‚Ä¢ I am CONSTIPATED as f***

Other than that, I‚Äôm so excited of whats to come. My longest streak in these last 3 years was 8 days. That was in May 2020. What lead me to quit this time was a chain of events that happened last week. 

1. I ran out of weed last Thursday evening around 9PM. I tried contacting about 8 different dealers and I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of any. I have a REALLY hard time falling asleep without smoking. I ended up staying awake the whole night, till morning around 10AM when a dealer wrote me back to come pick up some weed. I felt so weak. I promised myself that was the last time i‚Äôll ever buy weed.

2. Fast forward to Saturday of last week. I went to a party. I am totally against smoking weed at parties. In my opinion, everyone gets so dull at parties once its a smoke fest. ESPECIALLY me. Well, my cousin showed up to the party and I haven‚Äôt seen him in a long time. He had a J he was smoking so I decided to take one puff of it, thinking id be okay. That one puff changed my whole vibe. I was anxious, and ended up hiding in the far corner of the party so I wouldn‚Äôt be seen. I was so embarrassed. There was sooo many chicks there too. I felt like a lame. There were like 3 chicks whose number should have been in my phone right now. (I know, I shouldn‚Äôt be trying to pickup other girls when I have a girlfriend. I‚Äôm alittle optimistic ;)) I told myself NEVEERRR again weed. Never again!!! I did end up smoking 2 days after that, until my pack was completely finished.

Now here I am, 3 days clean and NEVER looking back. I couldn‚Äôt thank this community enough üôèüèΩ I love you all. Theres not many places in this world today that doesn‚Äôt judge off of race, sexual orientation, etc. so you guys rock man!!!",1

I struggle with perfectionism, impulse control problems, and I've gone up and down through phases of depression throughout my whole life.

I live in Oregon, and I can walk over to a super cheap weed store anytime I want, so that's pretty hard to pass up. And I can always come up with some rationalization to smoke -- to reward myself, to alleviate tiredness, or body pain (I do have a screwed up back), or even stave off hunger or weird stomach feelings, or.... get this: It always takes hours before I *really* do anything with my day, and I sure as shit can't get anything done while stoned, and I at one point came up with the idea to get stoned early in the day so that when I come down I'll be like, ""okay, I just wasted a bunch of time stoned. NOW I can get down to business and cram a bunch of work into the remainder of the day.""

So yeah that's just perfectionism, procrastination and impulsivity all intersecting.

I think I've developed that thing where your hunger kind of flows with when you're stoned and when you're not. I didn't smoke any weed today (yay) and I got feelings in my gut that I couldn't tell were signs of hunger or just indigestion. I was awake for like 4 hours at one point and thought, ""well, my body *has* to need food by this point,"" and I cooked up some stuff, and I had to eat it in tiny portions over like two hours -- putting in the fridge, taking it back out, and microwaving it multiple times.

Didn't taste too great either.

This was a vague-ass ramble, but the main point is that I recognize my problems and managed not to smoke any weed today, after months and months of being stoned 24/7.",3

I get a lot of ‚Äúbut weed isn‚Äôt even bad, it‚Äôs natural and there‚Äôs way worse you could be doing.‚Äù While that is true, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all here to better ourselves. If you‚Äôre here, you probably can‚Äôt balance your life with weed like some people can, but that‚Äôs completely okay! It just affects people differently. You can either keep trying to balance weed or just quit it completely because in the end, it is just a crutch to your life. 

Therefore, the discord is a safe place with wonderful people who you can relate to. I actually just joined this week, but I already feel connected to everyone there. We‚Äôre all going through the same struggle, I promise you that! I don‚Äôt even go to the zoom calls my therapist recommended me too, all though I should, the leaves discord is just a great place to be. I really look forward to the chats everyday just because I know I can relate to the people there. 

Anyways, stay strong in this journey and I know you can do it! Even if you don‚Äôt want to join the discord, just know that you‚Äôre not the only one in this situation. 

I don‚Äôt know a single person here, but all I know is that we should spread the love. I love you all and this is the first step you need to take in order to live out your life to the full potential!",26

Thankfully Im clean again about 3 weeks now. 

The hardest part for me was/is dealing with the boredom, a feeling i hadnt felt for 6 years.

I think Randy Marsh said it best: 

'The truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but‚Ä¶ well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at¬†anything.'

Anyone else relate?

EDIT:

This blew up more than i expected.

To anyone else reading this I'll offer you some advice i already put in one of the comments below that served me well.

-

If you want to outwit the devil, it is extremely important that you don't give him advanced notice.
Even if you only announce to yourself your intentions, the devil will know, because who do you think the devil is?

Meaning - try not to focus on giving up the smoke but rather on your actions in the present moment. If you tell yourself you're not smoking again for a year then your mind will present you with the idea of 365 excruciating days without smoke. 

Get through today first, it will get easier day by day.",451

I am constantly tired, have mood swings, my anxiety is through the roof, brain fog etc. I'm sure you guys understand.

My entire life I've always had huge expectations of myself. All through high school I worked my ass off to get into a top college. In college I worked my ass off to get the job of my dreams and by the end of it man was I burnt out. This is when I discovered weed. At first, I was able to chill for what seemed like the first time in my entire life. Then, before I knew it, I was smoking nearly everyday. No matter how bad my addiction was getting, I was able to keep my job, relationship, and family together.

Then, one day, through this haze, I had a moment of clarity when I was sitting in front of the computer starting my day job (which I absolutely loved) and I felt absolutely no desire to start working. This feeling did not go away for months. The very thing that I once loved I could no longer find pleasure in. This freaked me the hell out since I have always attached my sense of identity to my passion for my work. This is when I realized I was addicted and something was horribly wrong.

I am currently 8 days in and man the withdrawal is taking a toll on me. I'm so scared that I won't be able to find happiness in the work that I have loved so deeply since I was a child. I sometimes think how disappointed younger me would be to see me in this state. I will stick through this process no matter what though. I love how much support you guys have been giving in this community and that gave me the confidence to post here. Take care everyone, and good luck on each of your journeys.",6

The more honest i am with myself and others the more free i feel.
 what this time has taught me is im strong enough on my own. Ive always had the solution myself. I have never needed anything outside myself to 'fix' me. All i needed was time and a clear head to fix myself. I had been stopping the process of growing and finding out who i really am as a person. Which has never been as scary as my mind made it out to be. I have felt more alive in this last 6 weeks than i have in a very long time. 

I salute to the weed.

It wasn't a 24/7 thing, but it was close. I could tell I became dependent on the substance, and I needed to quit. Luckily, my local dealer decided to go on a spontaneous vacation cross country and left me dry and sober. I am currently 4 days sober, and the detox is horrible. Nausea, insomnia, nonexistent appetite, anger(lots of it), sweating, chills, tremors. God, I didn't realize it was this bad.

I have been thinking about my situation and a lot of situations that people close to me are going through, and it's occurred to me that the potential to get hooked onto this drug is very overlooked.

A little background of my life - started smoking casually at the age of 16 and quickly it became something that I would do everyday multiple times a day. Fast forward to today, I'm 24 years old,, I've been clean for 6 weeks on Sunday and I have struggled to stay clean many times before. I think my longest time being clean from weed was a year but that began to bud into alcoholism (6 beers a night, every night) so I turned back to weed as a justification to stop my daily drinking.

This got me thinking today, I look at so many of my friends who smoke every day multiple times a day who are in complete denial about weed being addictive just because the addiction symptoms aren't that serious and the withdrawals aren't that serious. 

However, with the overwhelming majority of my weed smoking friends, they,  like I had, do it multiple times a day every day. If you substituted any sort of substance for this kind of behavior you would be on the path to killing yourself.

So this brings me to my point - what makes weed so hard to get away from is the constant reassurance that what you are doing is not bad for your body and won't kill you. The reason why people can casually drink and not get addicted is the perceived risks in my opinion. I don't think chemically weed is as addictive as other things, but the constant rhetoric about it being something that isn't going to kill you is extremely dangerous and makes a lot of people overlook the other negative effects of smoking everyday.

Anyways, this was my little rant. Let me know what you all think. Getting really sick of those around me saying that I'm an idiot for thinking weed addiction is real, but yet they can't go a day without it.

Peace and love",7

I've taken breaks before but can't remember the last time I've gone 24 hours without smoking. My life is pretty good and I dubbed myself a ""functional stoner"" but the truth is that without my family's support and some lucky career moves I would likely be in poverty. I've been rescued from all of the worst consequences of my addiction and with everything I now have going for me, I can probably coast through the rest of my life like this and be comfortable.

I have reasons to quit; goals to accomplish that the money and attention drain of cannabis will make impossible.  These goals have motivated me to stop smoking in the past but as I get older and the window of opportunity on many of them closes, I'm beginning to feel resigned to the easy life. My resolve to quit feels insincere, like I've already accepted that I will fail and have forgiven myself for it before I even try to succeed. Then the first craving hits and I crumble.

Something has changed. When I failed to quit before it was because I would talk myself into thinking that I needed it or that it had a positive influence on me. Now I can go through the entire process of buying and smoking while fully aware that I am letting myself down.

To cut a long story short, turns out my Dad is an emotionally abusive ass hole. He is aggressive, immature and extremely volatile. As long as I can remember I thought there was something wrong with me. As an adult, I thought I was a druggie waste of space. Nah. I'm just the product of years of abuse. I may well disown my family, I'm so disgusted at how I've been treated. I can't believe it's taken years of counselling and a sober mind for me to realise.

I'm back here again (like 2nd or 3rd time attempting to quit??) after allowing myself to get back into heavy daily smoking that today I'm hoping is day 1 free of it. My problem is at times I can be a very impulsive intense person and when I get into something I REALLY get into it and always push things to the extreme with whatever I do if it grabs my attention and I enjoy it. 

Boys/gals I've really done it this time after having started dating a gal who loves to smoke heavily everyday so this has me in a pretty bad position as far as easily quitting. I care about her as a person, but I just do not see us working out if I am determined to be sober for good. I feel as if I need to be honest with her about how weed impacts me and that I just want to quit cold turkey. Smoking everyday and watching tv/movies and just sitting around has gotten so old for me now and I genuinely feel as if I'm just wasting so much valuable time. I'm an avid mountain biker and just love doing anything outdoorsy so having the most healthy lungs possible is a no-brainer for me. I'm hoping to get back into fishing and am wanting to get some huge hikes in before winter comes as well. 

I've told myself ""hey get a vaporizer at least it'll be healthier for you"". But still I get anxiety about spending extra money on devices for what to continue to get high in a cleaner way? Getting high is the problem and it's like a cycle, get anxiety/depression and then smoke and numb it. Lather, rinse, repeat. I have too much shit I want to do and I've become my own enemy with weed acting as the catalyst.

I work in tech so I'm allowed a ton of freedom to work from wherever and essentially make my own schedule as long as shit gets done in a reasonable amount of time. I've abused this privilege a ton during the pandemic and have been smoking during work hours and sometimes before important meetings. Like holy shit what the fuck am I thinking?! I work on very sensitive systems that could impact thousands upon thousands of people if I make any sort of small mistake with my code/work. I've been given literally thousands upon thousands of dollars in subscription/licensed based training that eventually will expire that I have not been focusing on or taking advantage of. So many other people would kill to be in my position and it's like I'm just doing the bare minimum. 

My manager and teammates would be super disappointed in me if they found out the truth so I want to do this for me first and foremost and also out of respect for them since I know for a fact I'll be a much more productive engineer/teammate.

This is my 4th or 5th time quitting. Each time I start up again, it leads me quicker and quicker to the addictive patterns. What took me years to realize my first couple times around occurred in 6 months this time around. The longest I‚Äôd quit was just over a year, which occurred between 2018-2019. 

But there‚Äôs a lesson I‚Äôve learned that I thought I‚Äôd share, because I believe it may hold a key to recovery.

Quitting isn‚Äôt just uncomfortable physically and emotionally. It isn‚Äôt just about ridding it from our systems and then trying to stay off it as long as we can, until the cravings begin again. It‚Äôs not about momentum and replacement behaviours. 

Quitting, I‚Äôve learned, is a spiritual crisis. It confronts the deeper parts of who we are that we struggle to show to the world and to loved ones. This quitting cycle, I‚Äôve noticed that my body presented me with some withdrawal symptoms that I‚Äôve never had before. I didn‚Äôt get the usual lack of appetite and insomnia. I got elevated anxiety, guilt, restlessness, mild depression, and much less ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù after the fog lifted. 

I‚Äôm getting the feeling that this is my spirit warning me that it can only go through this cycle so many times, before my very personhood is threatened. How many times must must I potentiate spiritual crises?

I can‚Äôt predict the future, but I do believe I‚Äôm on my way to a better sense of why it‚Äôs important to listen to the spirit. My only hope is that I listen enough to prevent these degrading cycles of false promise. 

I wish everyone the best in their daily trials and tribulations. We‚Äôre all different, yet in a similar struggle. I love this community.",11

My lungs get messed up and I can't take a full breath. I gorge myself on unhealthy food at night. I get socially awkward and lose my ability to be funny in social situations.

Day 2.,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old female who has been struggling with mental health issues such as depression and self-destructive behaviors that have led me to be admitted into the mental hospital 3 times this year.

I started smoking when I was like 16 and it became a daily habit over a year ago. I stopped going to school and nothing seemed worth getting out of bed for (except to get more weed). After being treated by a bunch of different doctors I‚Äôve found a really cool psychologist whom I really like and get along with since we have a lot in common. However, in this facility they don‚Äôt treat people who do non-prescribed drugs since it interferes with the diagnosis so I was told I needed to quit smoking weed or they‚Äôd kick me out and admit me into some rehab program. 

My therapist is very understanding and believes that weed is keeping me hostage and that I‚Äôd be the best version of myself after being clean for a while and after the break and getting discharged I‚Äôll decide wether smoking is worth it or not.

She doesn‚Äôt believe weed has caused much cognitive or intelectual harm but it‚Äôs obvious that it interferes with a normal/healthy lifestyle. 

I‚Äôm on day 2 of no smoking since I decided to stop cold turkey and still have some weed in my room and I‚Äôm not sure if quitting will actually help or if it‚Äôs just the addiction talking. 


All in all, I wanna do this bc I cant deal with my depression anymore and I trust my therapist and don‚Äôt wanna fuck up and get kicked out, but I needed to share this to put my thoughts in order and reflect on them.

Also, how can I ease the symptoms of quitting? i.e: restlessness, being tired, appetite loss which is already a problem for me since depression has made me lose a bunch of weight and now I‚Äôm underweight and weed was the only thing that made me hungry.",2

Since most of you guys were/are very heavy smokers, I wanted to share my point of view when it comes to quitting weed kinda early.
So I have never been into smoking when I was younger and started smoking weed when I was 17 maybe once per month. After I finished school i started smoking regulary and when I was about 18/19 I started smoking almost daily. At that time I was smoking about 1g a day MAX. I just loved the fact that I could smoke everyday without having a headache next day and it was just a fun time since all my friends were smoking as well.
Without noticing, I ignored the fact that smoking was actually the only reason for me to go outside. The more I smoked I started to realize that weed didnt give me anything anymore (luckily) and I was just holding myself back from things I actually wanted to do. Besides that I was spending about 300 ‚Ç¨ per month just for weed, which was  basically half my salary.
Now I am two weeks sober and my energy lvl is higher than ever. Besides that I realised, that weed is actually so useless in most situations, since I dont even notice when my friends are high.  Now to me it feels like their spending money to be normal lol. 
Now looking back at it I am just shocked how fast I started becoming a regular smoker and kind of addicted to weed.
Quitting was kind of easy tho since I never smoked that much weed. I just lost my apetite and started dreaming like crazy. Now after two weeks everything feels so real again and my apetite came back. Ive always thought that weed helped me sleeping but it really was the opposite looking back at it now.
Just wanted to show the younger people that its never too ""early"" to quit and once you start smoking regulary it doesnt give you anything especially when considering all the money you are wasting ( For me in two years of heavy smoking maybe 3-4k).

I hope some of you could relate to that.

For the last yrs, I don t think I ve been smoking much - 1 joint a day, or more if in social situations - but STILL, I really want to stop as It s making me terribly anxious and unhappy. 

Around 7pm it s the time of the day I feel like rolling a joint. I live in a shared apartment and even though I stopped buying a while ago, my flat mate smokes and I can t resist the temptation. Then I feel bad as I m smoking off her weed and so I consider buying myself.  I even use a visual technique (I have two jars, one has 7 tic-tac‚Äôs inside that I wish I would move in the 2nd jar - this representing a full week of not smoking weed). 

So I would really love to hear what techniques help you. I find it ridiculous that I managed to quit tobacco surrounded by heavy smokers but I have such problems with weed.

I‚Äôm proud of myself but I (18M) also feel like I lost some parts of myself and it‚Äôs hard trying to get that back without weed in the picture.,"The parts of myself I feel like I lost is my friendships, my social life, and my ‚Äúfun-ness‚Äù (If that‚Äôs even a thing). Looking back, my closest friend group pretty much revolves around smoking weed. As I think about it, none of us really had anything in common other than smoking our lungs out. Once I quit smoking and they knew about it, they didn‚Äôt really bother to reach out to me or check on me. In fact, they kind of discouraged me about it. I would like to hang out with them but I don‚Äôt want them to influence me into smoking again. Also, since I quit, I feel like I‚Äôm just laying in bed and staying home all day with nothing really to do. I‚Äôm mostly bored all the time and when I want to do something, I need to do it alone since all my friends smoke or vape (I also quit vaping at the same time). Without weed, my social life is pretty much gone, although, that alone won‚Äôt be an excuse to get back into smoking. In fact, it‚Äôs gotten kind of lonely. And lastly, I feel like I‚Äôve become a very boring and mundane person. I don‚Äôt really find any joy in anything. I feel like I‚Äôm just a zombie walking on earth. 

Has anyone dealt with this once they quit smoking? How did you solve these issues? I know the answer is find something you enjoy and meet new people but it‚Äôs especially hard during this pandemic and I just don‚Äôt have the courage and motivation to do those things.

Id also like to know how you feel since quitting, do you feel like its actually made a positive impact to your life since and if so in what way? Financially? Mindfully? 

Any advise would be appreciated, but here we go. Day 0. Next step is day 1",2

For context, I've been a daily smoker for that long. I have always been into bongs over spliffs. Bongs for breakfast, bongs before work, bongs after work, bongs before bed. I have been an underwhelming parent, spending a lot of time outside smoking instead of inside playing with and spending time with my daughter. I have been an underwhelming partner, spending hours trying to get it, then smoking it etc etc. I have been a nasty son of a \*\*\*\*\* when I haven't got it or waiting on it. I have spent emergency money which should have been spent on petrol/food and other supplies on bud.

I always thought to myself ''but it's part of me/my personality'' ''it keeps me calm'' and told my partner when she expressed me quitting ''you got with me when I smoked you can't expect me to change''. How wrong I was. One month down the line and I already feel my personality shining back through, I make more jokes, I'm around more, my motivation to make myself better for my family is coming back. I'm not in the clear yet, I still get cravings, when I smell it I get so jealous, but it's so worth it. I must have saved hundreds by now and saved HOURS waiting/smoking by not smoking for only a month. I'm having the craziest dreams for the first time in years. I actually have energy to do things. I'm in the middle of writing a business plan that I've been thinking about for years.

The feeling of pride is surreal. I know a lot of people are in the same boat. The feeling of helplessness that you can't stop yet. I promise you that you can. I was in a really bad place when I decided to quit and that made me realize now, there is NO good time to quit. Things will always pop up and make you think that you can't quit yet, but it's just part of the addiction. It's what held me back for ages (and withdrawals sucking so hard). ''Oh I lost my job, I'll definitely quit when I get a new one.'' ''Oh me and my partner are in a bad place, I'll quit when we're better'' etc etc. I won't give a sob story, but I really was and still am in a pretty bad place, but stopping smoking actually helps, rather than the opposite.

Sure the cravings, constant sweating, late nights trying to fall asleep absolutely suck. The first few days are the worst. But there is no better feeling being on the other side. Delete those contacts, if they text, delete those too. If you're friends and/or family are part of your smoking circle, tell them your stopping and you don't want to talk about bud AT ALL. You got this. You really do. Only you. Nobody can do it for you, make the change now, feel the benefits sooner rather than later. I believe in all of you.

Sorry for the huge wall of text, I just wanted to share my experience and maybe even help somebody who feels the same way I did a month ago. Here's to the next month. Cheers.",35

Just wanted to check in, as I'm going strong with quitting but I can feel my daily temptation to smoke getting stronger. 

I smoked every day for the last 3 years, but in the past 2 months I've determinedly tried to quit. 

I have relapsed a few times, but I always keep it limited to the one day. And more importantly, I feel like I always learn from it (what I'd lose by smoking, the fact that it's not even enjoyable anymore).

Right now I'm at a week and a half, and in the last month overall I've only smoked a handful of times. 

It's gotten easier to resist, especially as I feel my mind coming back to me. My concentration and drive get stronger as the concentration of THC in me gets smaller. 

Sometimes I have hard days, like today, but what matters is I don't give in. And when I'm able to keep myself from smoking, I learn how much stronger I really am.

I recall times I tried to stop as being generally more relaxed mentally (after getting over withdrawals of course). I notice that if I start up again, the longer I continue to smoke, over the months my mental health gets worse and worse. I start to have suicidal thoughts, wanting to hurt myself, having out-of-control anxiety and a super short temper. I hate the person I‚Äôve become. I remember this exact same thing happened to me a couple times before and each time I stopped, I gradually felt better till I relapsed and started this cycle again. 

Maybe it helps some people medically with depression and anxiety but I just don‚Äôt see how because at least for me, I think it makes it a hundred times worse (in the long run). It‚Äôs probably because now my system relies on a plant to get any sort of  happiness or relaxation which is insane.

History: I started smoking weed when I was 20, and carried on the habit for 3 years after. I don't completely regret using; it did help me cope with chronic illness and depression my last year of college. It also helped me find clarity about many aspects in my life. But! More recently, over the past year, weed stopped being a help to me, and started making me feel anxious and weird. Sometimes I'd smoke and it felt like my head was going to explode with anxious existentialism, depression, and unwanted thoughts. I also started making really poor choices socially while high. However, since I don't really drink alcohol, I kept weed as my vice. I thought I was just in a funk with weed, and it would soon go back to how I felt when I first started smoking. That day has never come.

I stopped a couple weeks ago unintentionally when I spent the night at my parents' house on a whim, and didn't have my weed. I woke up the next morning feeling unanxious and clear. My skin looked better and my eyes weren't puffy and bloodshot. I suddenly realized that I could be content (maybe not happy, but at least content) without weed. Since that night, I've only smoked once for medicinal purposes after I had a strong martini that made me feel nauseous (again, I don't normally drink, so I'm a lightweight).

I have noticed these overall improvements:

\-I no longer wake up with dry mouth and grogginess.

\-I have SO much energy...seriously, too much. I don't get tired and foggy during the day like I used to with regular pot use. It's a little freaky.

\-I am more emotionally stable.

\-I care less about what others think of me--social anxiety has dropped significantly.

\-I am more social and open-hearted towards others--more generous and kind.

\-I feel motivated to exercise again.

\-I feel more confident in my ability to get through life without having a crutch.

\-More confidence in my appearance--seeing things I like about myself and appreciating them

\-I feel more content and not completely overcome with worry and depression.

\-My eyes look bright and I don't feel the need to wear much makeup anymore. I used to wear a moderate amount of makeup, and now I'm just down to mascara and a little lip color. But, I feel beautiful even without makeup now.

\-This might be TMI, but I'm just so thankful for this last point so I'm going to share--I have had a yeast infection since January that would not go away, no matter what I tried. I tried western medicine, supplements, acupuncture, etc. It would not leave me. Sooo uncomfortable and frustrating. My self esteem was really low because of this. Since stopping weed ONLY 2 WEEKS AGO, it has cleared up 90% on its own. People say that marijuana helps the immune system, and I think it does in some ways. But, clearly, I was abusing it if I still had this illness after 9 months.

I hope that this encourages those who may be lurking on this sub as I was a few weeks ago at the beginning of my quitting journey. You CAN survive and thrive without weed. Remember that your body is fighting hard to keep you healthy and strong. Treat it right. Much love to you all.",14

I was a straight A student. Got into trouble after bringing edibles to a field trip and a friend fainted, had to be clean for a year at 18 which was not an issue because I just did it with friends. 
Smoked a lot more in college, but never before class or anything. Mostly because I couldn‚Äôt afford it. I did pass out during a night clinical rotation (was taking Adderall recreationally and was reallllly high) so definitely still impacted me. 
Now, I‚Äôve been a nurse for 4 years and it ended up progressing badly once it became legal in my state. I got my med card because I was sick of paying extra. Over the past year, I‚Äôve been smoking ALL day every day. I will leave nurses meetings to go to my car and hit my cart. I was going through a 1gram cart in just days. 
I found a new job because I thought that would be the solution to my problems (didn‚Äôt acknowledge that addiction is my problem) 
Turns out I needed to pass a drug test for this job. I went 3 days and was initially super dedicated. But then, I realized I wouldn‚Äôt pass the test anyways so devoted myself to research best way to fake. $100‚Äôs on fake urine so I could practice etc. I only lasted 3 days. 
Now, I am actually having to take a mouth drug swab this Friday so quit Monday. I‚Äôm not really worried about passing, because I know I will, but I‚Äôm very anxious about after the drug test. I want to keep this going but I‚Äôm going CRAZY. 
Examples: 
Getting furious at coworkers and being mean (I never am) 
Randomly crying, even at work which is very embarrassing 
NO sleep despite OTC meds and meditation 
NO appetite- I‚Äôve lost 6 pounds in 3 days and am already at a dangerously low weight 
I have epilepsy and feel like it helped so much. 

I would‚Äôve never had the energy to make a post like this if I was high. I feel MANIC right now, but not in a good way.

I have been blessed with 147 days of purity and clarity. 
But why doesn‚Äôt it feel like that?


147 days ago I was hopeless. I had stolen money from parents, to steal their car to go buy from a guy who knew someone, who knew someone that I used to have class with. The last contact in New York City I hadn‚Äôt burned. 

I was failing my high school senior year classes, in a credit recovery program to make up the classes I missed while attending wilderness therapy, and I had grades in the single digits. At the epicenter of a global pandemic, I felt like God had struck me with the worst feelings of dejection and loneliness one could feel. 

It had been ~3 years since I‚Äôve caught this disease, a chronic case of addiction that is so grim, you‚Äôd want to live in a horror movie instead. I chose to be homeless at 16 for a month to feed my hunger. I gave up all of my friends, T10 college qualifications, everything and everyone but the clothes off my back just to smoke. I was in and out of school, felt like shit day in and day out, and was ready to give it up.

That was, until the last time I smoked.

It was less than a month before my 18th birthday. School was an afterthought, everything had just become online and I couldn‚Äôt even bother to login once a day. I had no friends to waste time with, and I couldn‚Äôt leave the house anyway if I wanted to, without running the risk of catching ‚Äúthat virus‚Äù. I felt like a prisoner in my own home. I snapped. I risked my life to cop a smoke. I legally couldn‚Äôt stay out that night, so I had to return home to an ass-whooping and a forfeiture of basic privileges.

With nothing to do but schoolwork, I magically found the same drive and passion for education that I had before smoking. I turned over a year and half of schoolwork in 2 months, an entire month ahead of time. I got my high school diploma that seemed so unattainable before. I applied to colleges last minute in June, and lo and behold there‚Äôs a decent school willing to take me. Since my family‚Äôs poor, it turns out I don‚Äôt pay a dime for college, but I also get money back. Three weeks ago I started Zoom classes.

Just like that. In 147 days of sobriety, I went from not having enough credits to be a senior in high school, to getting paid to go to a better than average college. 

So why do I still want to smoke so badly? 

Why does everything seem so bland? Why does color seem gray, food seem tasteless, and music sound like background noise? When I was shithole-depressed and smoking, at least I would feel like I was having fun while high. Now, it feels like I‚Äôm just some ant in a colony working until death. I‚Äôve been eating a lot more to wean the urges, but it‚Äôs not like food‚Äôs been tasting better. Nature walks at sunset seem bland compared to that blazed midnight stroll in the middle of the city. Hell, when I‚Äôm stoned, elevator music sounds more deep than any music sober.

Why is that?

How come I‚Äôve gone through hell and back giving up THC and Nicotine, but life doesn‚Äôt feel richer? In the same way people say being high is boring, how come sobriety feels 10x more stale?

I‚Äôve rambled too much now. If you‚Äôre still here, I want to personally tell you to take it one day at a time ü§ü. When you hit rock bottom, the only way is up. 

TL;DR: 147 days sober and turned my life around. Why does everything seem so boring sober?",24

I've stopped a few times throughout the years and every time I start having really intense dreams. In several of these dreams I wake up right before I would have likely died (in the dream). Now I can't call them nightmare because they aren't all scary but they are super vivid and feel real, sometimes they still feel real for a few minutes after I wake up. Sometimes they are really weird, like things that would likely never happen to me in real life and other times they are quite possible.

Currently I'm laying in bed not able to go back to sleep just yet because I woke up from one of the dreams. My wife and I were lost looking for a friend's house when three guys on bikes rode up to us. The leader slid his bike sideways in front of our vehicle and pointed a gun at me. I swerved into the ditch to avoid him, the back end of our suv slid out as I pulled back onto the road and took off between the other two guys, one of which was pulling out his gun.I kept waiting to hear the pop of a gunshot or the shattering of out back glass but it didn't happen. I swung the suv around the corner and hauled ass...right into a dead end. I backed into a driveway feeling shaken but safe and then I heard them yelling as they came down the street towards us. So I tell my wife forget going to our friend's house we are going home. I took off spinning the tires and then I woke up.

Has anyone else had really intense real feeling dreams after quitting?

I went through a rough one month breakup, where i kept holding on, cried alot, felt numb alot,  then i was sleep deprived for a week where i slept 4-5 hours everyday, i was stressed out by relationship, was too tired and numb and had deadlines and work everyday. I also been using my phone screen for 12/13 hours everyday just surfing through social media

I am constantly on autopilot mode , i feel numb and zoned out. I can't describe this feeling its like "" you just do something and that something feels like a distant past"" like i take a shower and when i come out of the bathroom its like I remember taking the shower but not feeling it, like did it just happen? It feels like it happened some while ago"" and this feeling is constant with almost  everything i do , i am also spacing out numbed and zoning out, my relationship is back on track we patched up and things are going well , and I'm playing with my dogs hanging out with friends and i dont feel much, i do laugh and giggle at times, but when its done, i feel nothing, no attachment to the day or things that happened.

It was a struggle but ultimately the feeling subsided. Earlier in the day I got an intense feeling of anxiety, I would get these all the time growing up and weed made them basically non existent. 

The more I realize that there is a separation between who I am and my mind the more I become okay with these feelings and let them pass like a rainy day. The mind is not you, the mind tries to control you. 

I am laying in bed and was reading some old journals from when I couldn‚Äôt get clean I read this one and it motivated me to keep going because even though I am only 11 days in my journey I am miles away from the person who wrote this a month ago: 

‚ÄúI am still smoking everyday like an addict. I ordered a new cartridge for my pen because I don't like the look of smoking a j and blowing it into the microwave vent. I smoke weed like it is crack, I am astonished at my addiction I know it has existed for so long but I am the guy who sneaks away to the bathroom to get high. Who is always stoned at work who smokes in his apartment with his daughter sleeping in the next room and yet I continue. It's bullshit. I don't feel anger in this moment, maybe because I am high and I am numb to my feelings. That should upset me make me furious with myself, make me want to take action and correct my ways. But I am selfish and I need to change.‚Äù

I had some serious urges a week before relapsing, and it finally happened when I opened a package from my sister in Oregon.  She sent me a solid oz of cones-mixed strains, as well as edibles.  I had an idea what was in the box, and I can't lie; I was excited to open it.

I hadn't told her I had quit smoking.  She thought she was doing me a solid.

I immediately went to work.

Here I am...2 days into my awesome new job, and I'm already effing up.  I started yesterday.  I have the attention span of a gnat.  I'm supposed to be taking over major projects and when my new boss asked me a couple of questions today I could tell he was less than impressed.  I sat in on a few meetings, shadowing, and I retained nothing and found my mind wandering.  At one point in my day I went on linkedin and started looking at other jobs.  I spaced out.  Ignored a few chat messages (blaming it on being new and being in other meetings).  I spent the day booking out fake meetings for the rest of the week so people will leave me alone.

This was my dream job and I'm screwing up.

I feel like I'm in over my head.

I'm no longer dreaming at night, and I really loved that part of not smoking.

I just keep resetting my grounded app.  I had just received the one month award and was proud AF.  Now, I smoke, then I just login and 'check in', say I smoked, and reset the day.  At one point I logged in and it said, ""2 hrs, 3 min"" and I just reset without a second thought.

I don't know what happened, or how I ended up here after being so damn committed.

It's only been a little over a week.  I feel like I need to grab onto the tail end of that 34 day streak and cling to it.  The fact that I went that long is my only real salvation.  Maybe I can do it again?

I am a daily smoker, used to smoke probably 6 times a day however in the past couple months I've only been smoking like 3 bowls a day, but instead of just weed, it's usually 50% batch. For the longest time I've been wanting to quit, but I've been struggling. Today I just smoked a bowl but for some reason I really think it will be my last, I have done this before where I say I will quit after smoking and then smoke a bowl 2 hours later, but I really need to quit. I think that's part of why I'm writing this, as a reminder to refrain myself from lighting up. I'm the type of smoker where I would smoke during everything, I usually am more productive while I smoke, however I've been noticing many adverse side effects from my smoking habits. For example, I am a male around 5'11 and 108 pounds and even though I eat 3 meals a day, I have still been the same weight for the past year. My gums have also been pretty red recently and I'm starting to think I have gum disease, however that may not be from smoking but from my stupidity for being too lazy to floss everyday, but smoking definitely does not help it, thats for sure. SO yeah, idk tbh as I'm writing this I already feel like I want another smoke lol, this is gonna be tough. if you guys are in the process in quitting batch or have already quit, feel free to share your experiences. How long until do you have to go until the withdrawal gets better? Did you have trouble gaining weight while smoking, and when you quit did you begin to gain weight back?",1

I smoked everyday for a good 10 yrs from the age of 19. At first it was just on a night. As the years progressed my usage increased to where I would wake and bake and smoke throughout the day consistently.  When I used to start running low on weed I would get this horrible anxiety. In all honesty I couldn‚Äôt see past my next spliff which isn‚Äôt a nice way to live. It got to the point where I no longer went out or socialised, my physical and mental health declined and I would avoid everyone so I could stay home and smoke. I would justify it in my head all the time and I was in denial. It wasn‚Äôt until I saw another friend of mine acting the same way that I was that I thought I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I don‚Äôt even think I liked the feeling of being high anymore it was purely routine. I remember as soon as I smoked a spliff I would count down sometime before I rolled another one. An example being I would watch 2 episodes or a movie on Netflix and then roll another. It had gotten that bad. I‚Äôm nearly 25 days clean now. When I first stopped smoking the night sweats was terrible, I couldn‚Äôt sleep properly. I felt sick constantly and couldn‚Äôt eat properly. I kept getting stuck in little thought loops in my head and would cry. The first few days was the worst but I would say after the first week it gets soooooo much easier! I started exercising again I walk about 3 miles a day now with my dog and I went and brought myself a kettlebell. Exercise has really helped me and it‚Äôs amazing how your fitness comes backs relatively quickly. I now do a kettlebell routine and core strength exercises on the night. Just press ups, planks, sit ups etc. Im now eating more and putting abit of weight back on. I was underweight well I still am but not as much as before. 
I downloaded the I am sober app I think it‚Äôs called. It‚Äôs nice to have a timer/calendar going so you can see the progress you are making. 
I even managed to be around friends who still smoke which I really didn‚Äôt think I would be able to do. I really thought I would miss cannabis but as the days go on I realise that I don‚Äôt. I have no desire at the moment to smoke again. I genuinely don‚Äôt want to go back to how I was before it wasn‚Äôt a good way to live. To people who say cannabis isn‚Äôt addictive it can be to certain people. Just like chocolate or other stuff can be addictive to some people. I am still pro cannabis as it can be very beneficial to some people, I‚Äôve come to accept I‚Äôm not one of those people though. 
To people out there who are just starting their journey of quitting keep at it! I promise it gets easier. Try to write a journal or take up exercise or a new hobby to pass the time where you would be sat blazing. 
Use the free time to see the beauty in things and reconnect with things you used to do or use it as a opportunity to try new things. 

Peace out and have a blessed day everyone!",14
2020-09-15 17:05:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ithoez/day_1/,Day 1,"I was once sober for 5 years, and now--for the past 5.5 years--I've been a daily smoker again. I've been smoking this entire time wanting to quit and go back to the life I had before. Nearly every day for the past 5 years I've planned out how/when I'll quit. I've tried every single trick in the book. I've even poured motor oil into my bag of weed... just to end up trying to press the oil back out, and smoking it anyway. Multiple times. 

Every single day I smoke... I dream about what things will be like when I'm finally able to quit again. I've been smoking and dreaming of quitting for years. Each bag is my last bag, and every time I finish one, tomorrow is the day. It's going to really be it this time. Tomorrow is the day I'm done.

Then tomorrow comes and it's no longer tomorrow... and literally my first thought as I open my eyes is: ""I can't. Not today. I'll get one more bag and quit in a few days. Things will be better then and I'll be ready to quit then.""

When I give in and decide ""one more bag"" I get an overwhelming feeling of calmness as if I already picked up and was already smoking. I don't feel overwhelmed with anxiety and fear anymore, but it's replaced with overwhelming feelings of shame and guilt because I failed yet again. I feel pathetic, worthless, and weak... and I live in fear that one day someone will find out and see how pathetic I am. I hate myself when I see my wife look at me disappointed, as I grab the keys and go get ""one more bag.""

I get my weed and smoke and feel worse. It's never great anymore. It's not even good. I have to smoke so much to even feel ""high"" and the entire time I'm hacking up my lungs trying to just feel high for a few minutes... Holding it in as long as I can... hoping to feel something. Untimately hoping to feel nothing at the same time.

Today is yesterday's ""tomorrow"" and is Day 1 for me. I usually have 2-3 days a week which start as ""Day 1."" I've already hit my dealer up, and am just hoping that I maybe don't go through with it. At the same time, I'm hoping that I do so that I can just feel normal for a couple more days. Even though I know that the ""couple more days"" trick is a lie.

I hate this. I hate that every bone in my body can hate something so fucking much, yet I can't let go of it. Not only that, but that I can feel like that for YEARS, and still not have the strength to walk away. I'm afraid that I won't be able to quit unless something catastrophic happens in my life. I don't want to wait until I lose my job. Or wait until my wife loses her patience with me.

I'm sorry that I'm not adding much advice for many here, but hopefully my struggles can help remind some out there how truly powerful this little plant is...

I'm going to keep trying to be a part of this community as much as I can. I clearly can't do it completely on my own.

Thanks for being here.",23

I was using since 8th grade to help with insomnia, migraines, and to eat. A family figure encouraged me to use it in a \*helping\* way. I was becoming dependent and abusing it around my sophomore year. This was where it sort of started taking a toll on mental health and every day routine. I was not thinking thoroughly about my choices and would be in school foggy-headed. My grades were slowly decreasing and my effort in homework was poor. Once I hit my senior year in fall of 2019, I had to start cleaning up and get my sh\*t back together or I'll be a 'super senior'. My stress triggered immediately and would find myself back where I was before. I asked for help and a guide to help me, it worked for a little awhile and it yet returned. After I graduated in June 2020, I was thinking how the h\*ll am I going to get out of this cycle and BOOM! I gathered up the courage and threw everything I had away. This was weeks ago and it makes me proud for what I did. I am gaining back my independence and seeing everything clear again. I start my first official job soon and about to be enrolled at my local community college. I have a big family of younger relatives, who look up to me for anything, and I genuinely want the best for them and be their guide through any situation. It was a challenge, but I had to grease up my elbows and be prepared for what's coming. Thank you for taking your time out to read my experience and willing to give feedback.

The problem (and my question) is: Is it common to have trouble sleeping for so long after quitting, or is there a chance I'll need professional help to get back into my usual sleep routine?



Also, while I'm here I want to add something to spread the positivity: 
Besides lack of sleep and a few moodswings I've been hella glad with the results of quitting! I'm tired, but far from how cloudy and foggy I was all the time. 
I can socialize with strangers in a normal manner without having a constant lack of words, and I've been 10000% more productive than I've been over the past 4 years! :)
Damn, I even inspired one of my best friends to quit while he's been smoking long before I did.

I wanna thank y'all for all of that!
When I quit, I read succes stories on here 5 nights straight, it reminded me of why I was quitting and it made the cravings resistible! Now I don't even feel the need to smoke a joint, even when I'm hanging with my stoner friends. And if the thought of rolling one pops up in my head, I'll go right back to this subreddit to shut the thought down ;)

So again, thanks a lot! And to everyone who just quit: Stay strong! Times can be rough, but in a few weeks you'll thank yourself for not letting the addiction get a hold of you any longer!

Thank you for reading my story, I hope some of you can answer my question (which was the reason I started writing this whole essay haha)

Hey guys 21m here,

Been through a breakup, after a living relationship , brokeup for a month and patched up a week ago but the month was rough, lotd of stress, less sleep, constantly on my phone like 12 hours a day, went on walks but got like 5/6 hours of sleep constantly, holding on was rough, tried alot and never felt loved, went to her home but she always kicked me out , alot of emotions it was emotional ride, i felt numb alot, and disassociatee , also the relationship was very toxic we kept fighting physically for almost a year , we madeup every night but it became a toxic habit. We lived seperately for 5-6 months now and haven't fought physically but we've had alot of ups & downs. 

Its been a week since we patched up, obviously she was suffering in her own ways . But we agreed to just be there and support eachother, right now things are really good but i am still numb and constantly zoning out, and i feel so disassociated , like I don't feel anything. I am on autopilot mode, i do everything but I don't feel it, 

I also have anxiety cause of leaving weed, 1-5 years ago, and its on and off, but this feeling of being zoning out and being numb and really high ish, makes me anxious which makes me numb and disassociated. 

Idk if this is my body coping to stress or my anxiety, the disassociation really started aftwr i went sleepless or just a few hours of sleep for a few nights and when i wokeup I couldn't sleep properly or even when i slept i didn't know if i slept or not, and I've really been zoning out and spacing out and feeling numb alot

2020-09-15 08:10:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/it7hte/my_story_of_recovery_from_marijuana_addiction/,My story of recovery from marijuana addiction,"Sharing my story in the hope that it may help one of us. 

I‚Äôve battled addiction issues my entire adult life. I started drinking in high school and was arrested for drunk driving at the age of 17. I drank heavily throughout college and was constantly causing problems for myself - getting arrested, damaging relationships, spiraling. I started smoking weed in high school and then became a habitual user in college. My roommate and I felt we couldn‚Äôt function without a bag of weed and lived that way for a few years. Nearing graduation I realized I needed to stop smoking in order to start my career. I was able to do so and refrain from smoking for over 10 years. I managed to start a career and a family and a great life. 

About 5-6 years ago I drank so much while on a work trip in Brazil that I woke up in a hospital. At that point I stopped drinking completely, with support from AA and counseling. Fast forward a couple of years and I came to know that a friend of mine smoked. For the first time in more than a decade I smoked and fell in love all over again. It was everything I had romanticized it to be and more. Slowly I began to smoke with him frequently, then asked him to buy for me so I could smoke alone, then for his contact so I could buy at my own frequency. Around the same time my college roommate committed suicide and it really messed me up. Before I knew it I was staying high from the moment I woke up until I went to sleep. All the while keeping this a secret from my wife. I would smoke to and from work. I would contrive reasons to go to the store so I could get high on the way. It seemed harmless and fun - people would laugh at me in the grocery when I walked by because of the smell. And embarrassingly this made me feel cool. I rationalized it as a way to help address my anxiety (though it undoubtedly worsened my anxiety) and lied to myself making me think i was more creative or positive when high. ‚ÄúI have my best ideas when I‚Äôm high.‚Äù I was a highly functioning adult father stoner. 

Eventually my wife found out that I had been smoking for months and was heartbroken over the lying. I threw out my weed and pipe and vowed to not do it anymore. But not before digging it out of our trash can outside and getting high just one last time. Somehow I still didn‚Äôt think I had a problem, I was just appeasing her and her anti-marijuana beliefs.

13 months later I convinced myself that I would buy a bag and smoke ‚Äúonly on the weekends and when I was alone.‚Äù I purchased through a different friend on a Thursday. Instead of moderating, I smoked nonstop until 2 days later when my wife found the stash in my car. She was devastated and I was angry. In protest i did what I did best - left the house and got high. I came home high and that was it ‚Äî she couldn‚Äôt believe that I had done the very thing that was causing all of these problems in my life. I was talking to my father and I‚Äôll never forget what he asked me: ‚ÄúWhy in the middle of all of this would you make matters worse by going and getting high again right now?‚Äù

His question hit me hard because I realized there was only one answer - I didn‚Äôt have a choice in the matter at that point. I was completely abusing marijuana and couldn‚Äôt make a decision for myself. I had no logical explanation for why I would do that, or better said why I couldn‚Äôt refrain for a bit. I had completely lost control. 

That week I began an outpatient treatment program. I carried a lot of shame because many others were recovering from ‚Äúhard‚Äù drugs. I felt silly to be there talking about my addiction. But I had to learn that my addictive tendencies were rampant and my abuse of marijuana was real. If anything, I was grateful that I hadn‚Äôt found my way to something more harmful because I am sure I would have destroyed myself and my life. 

I am now 16+ months clean and feeling good about it. I no longer miss weed on a regular basis. I feel well-adjusted and am comfortable with myself. I don‚Äôt need weed to be funny or introspective. That was just a crutch. I still feel pangs to get high when I walk by someone smoking or hear a particular song glamorizing it, but the feeling passes. Cravings are fleeting. I now have the tools to cope and I haven‚Äôt lost everything I loved along the way. For this I am extremely fortunate. 

For me, the trickiest part about addiction is that the mind of an addict will cleverly deceive itself by suppressing the memories of the problems and harm caused by one‚Äôs usage and inability to moderate. The feeling of despair and the acceptance of the severity of one‚Äôs affliction fades over time. The hurt lessens and the sense of urgency wanes. This leads to complacency and rationalization that future usage is manageable. It is not - not for people like you and me. It sucks, but it‚Äôs okay. 

Last month I got my first tattoo to commemorate my journey and specifically my 20 days in rehab. It‚Äôs meant to help my hold on to that elusive memory of the despair and destruction I have caused and to remind me that I am not wired like others. It also reminds me that our condition is permanent.

We cannot outrun it. We cannot smoke or drink without repercussion. We can‚Äôt have just one beer or one hit. It doesn‚Äôt work that way for us, and that‚Äôs okay. 

Please know that you‚Äôre not alone. I would gladly tal with any of you or answer any questions you might have. 

Take care of yourself and keep your head up.

I've been staying sober for 5 months now from 17 years of daily smoking (not heavy, just one joint each evening), and with each passing day I get more and more hell bent on never smoking again. I'm slowly getting to grips with the fact that I have been an addict to the herb, and it has held me back in many ways.

I'm healthier and happier than I've been in a long time, but I get days were I wake up and feel super depressed, almost suicidal, and it lasts through the day. I don't have any good reason to be depressed either..it feels so strange.

Just want to know if anyone else have it this way?",1

I'm excited tho, I'm a carguy myself so I'm glad I'll have more money to improve my car. Also looking forward to driving without worries. Haha. 

I'm feeling good about this fresh start, it will be frustrating at first but I'm sure it'll go away. I think that quitting together will help us all get trough this easier.

Yesterday I visited a friend and music partner. Back in my days of active addiction, I used to go over there all the time as it was a safe space for making music and smoking (shitloads) of weed. We would be productive for the first few hours and then gradually lose this productivity as we got high. 

Yesterday, I went over there and watched my friend roll and smoke three to four joints with a couple cigarettes in between. Each joint seemed to satisfy him for a bit, but after around twenty to thirty minutes he would be ready to smoke another. None of the joints thus truly satisfied him. 

As I stayed sober, I managed to keep my productivity levels up until the point where it made sense to go home. I did not eat unhealthy amounts of unhealthy foods, I did not smoke more joints than I intended, I did not get so high that I was barely able to talk let alone produce music.

Some of the joints seemed appealing. Just the thought of having one in your mouth, lighting it, and taking a puff after which you feel the effect, it still seems so good. But I know I would hate myself if I were to indulge, for I've decided smoking weed is not for me anymore.

I'll admit that it was probably a good thing that I waited to be sober for two weeks before going back; I might have cracked if my streak was a bit shorter. I did it, you can do it too. Say no to one joint/bowl/edible/whatever at a time and you can last as long as you want. Good luck and strength to all of you.",2

Hello guys, 21m here, back here after a year and plus, i left weed almost 1 and half years  ago and my withdrawals were crazy, gave me anxiety, made me dissociate , brain fog , constant anxiety zoning out and feeling numb, always dreading and what not.  Reddit helped me out a bit, after 2-3 months of a very rough time, the symptoms faded. And especially when i fell in love with my current gf at that time, it really helped me occupy my mind and my life and i was soo busy that eventually i got better. But over the year certainly there are months where i feel really good and have a good time. Anxiety is always there is small amount. But i have definitely felt good for months then again i dissociate at times, for few days or a week at max, Brain fog and tiredness were there, especially cause my sleep routine hasn't been the best, i sleep during the day and wake up during night, months of no direct sunlight. I skipped college and took a gap year spend my time with my gf living together, 
Watching Netflix ,being unproductive skipping college, and just partying alot. It was pretty enjoyable tho, and there were 2/3 occasions where my anxiety made me feel like i was losing my mind, but my gf helped me calmed down, usually those 2/3  i had pulled an all-nighter or was very stressed which eventually builded up to that, i hve certainly felt dissociative at times, like my body feeling weird, things around me feeling not real. But since i was with my gf and friends 24/7 , I didn't obsesse over it and it easily disappeared in a day or few days or even hours sometimes. 

Right now I'm suffering a bit too tho, so I've lived in a living relationship which was the best thing ever but things got really toxic, we started fighting physically almost everyday , but we made up every night, apologised , slept together, loved eachother but the cycle did continue almost for 7-8 months, there were weeks where we fought everyday and weeks where we never fought atleast not physically, but we always made up immediately but there were times when we went for hours fighting locked up in a room. This continued for almost a year,(we've been together 1.5yrs) . Maybe all the fights we're making me disassociate at the time or maybe it was my anxiety or both

So , we've been living seperately for 5-6 months now, but our relationship was still going through so many ups and downs, we didn't fight physically , but we did fight over the phone and text and even in person. And apparently all these things were taking a toll on my gf too, she's been suffering a bit from depressive symptoms, feeling sucidial which is giving her a bit of anxiety aswell. But obviously it must be the relationship trauma, but also she has financial problems, her parents divorcing, she feels like a burden. And she has huge financial crisis. She's visiting a therapist.

Coming back to me again, And we brokeup for a month, 1-2 weeks ago we patched up, but in the breaking up month, alot of drama, alot of ups and down, alot of fights over text and phone, cried alot, felt numb alot, panicked alot,

And so its been 15-20 days i've been feeling dissociative and zoning out and spacing out alot, these hasn't ever gone for this long, I suddenly had a week of sleep deprivation where I slept for only 4/5 hours everyday and i woke up feeling really zoned out like i woke up feeling like i didn't know if i slept or not, i was really stressful in that week, had to wakeup early for work , and when i tried to sleep at night, I couldn't my mind was blank and anxiety kept me awake, especially cause i had a habit of sleeping at 6 am.  

I also been using phone alot, everyday, 12 hours daily average for 2-3 weeks cause i use my phone all night texting people. 

So I don't feel really focused, i am constantly tired and foggy, i cant concentrate or read , i have been working on my screen time reducing it to 6-7/8 hours cause i have my classes online? And been trying sketch or keep busy with family
But i 've been disassociating

Right now, i feel like I'm dissociating, i am zoning out , especially past few days, i am keeping myself as busy as possible but, i am spacing out , I patched up with my girlfriend and we been so good for a week , we meet up frequently and i walk 1-2 hours everyday where my mind goes into trance/ or zones out, driving feels overwhelming, and especially idk what this is but , can anyone explain "" i feel that something i just did feels like a distant past, for example if i just washed my hands and came out of the toilet , I'm like woah , did i just do that rn, like I remember everything, but I don't have the feeling attached to it, and its with everything , even with my gf I'm not able to really show any emotion. I do laugh and stuff, but I'm constantly on autopilot, like i do and carry our all my things properly, even attend classes where i am spacing out, but I don't feel. Much. Right now I'm constantly zoning in and out every minute, things i just do a few seconds ago feels unreal or i have no feelings of it, i clearly remember the details but I don't feel like i did it. All of these feelings give me anxiety and make me feel even more numb.

Idk what this is, is it my breaking up, relationship, sleep / stress, anxiety , am I disassociating or is it something else? Guys help me out please.",1

I'm a dad whos 27 starting smoking at about 14 to drown out the problems of home life.
I'm now a father of 2 beautiful boys with a wife who has never smoked cigarettes let alone joints!! She's always wanted me to quit as she only sees the negative things that come with smoking.. terrible in the mornings angry hate the world.  Until smoking then feeling i can function.. wouldn't be able to even hoover the house without having a joint putting music on and basically being in another dimension when i do simple things.
I've been hiding my smoking for about 6 months telling my wife i only smoke at weekends.. but fortunately i got caught out on Thursday.. she wanted to end it said she had become a adult and a parent but all i want to do is sit around get high i love my family unconditionally and personally wouldn't see a purpose in life if i couldn't provide for them and make them happy.
I always believed when i had my kids that I'd be able to quit like a flash and live a normal life.. but I've decided to be completely honest with myself and say its quite literally terrifying to think about life without weed. I don't know who i am as a person any more..
I need to quit for me my wife and my 2 children its the least they deserve in life. 
I had my last smoke on sunday night and gave my stash to my wife to hide from me which when seeing her face made me just so sure that I'm making the right decision.
But it is a drug and you really do feel you need it to survive life.  I got home from a night shift and without thinking about it i was searching the house for my box of bits. I decided that it was a pathetic thing to do so i sat down and listened to some mindfulness on YouTube which honestly actually really helped i started to fall asleep so i went to bed without a smoke for the 1st time in over a decade.. (apart from abroad holidays) i continued with the mindfulness in bed.. fell asleep peacefully. I woke this morning feeling awake and alive, i really believe now that life is there for the taking as long as i stay strong enough is enough and its time to love a normal life.
Thank you all for taking the time to listen heres to day 2 of a non cloudy life.
Thank you",14

Out of those 3 years I was completely sober for about a total of 9 months.  In my brain, those 9 months seem to have lasted longer than the 30ish months I was on rosin/shatter all day everyday.

Does anyone else feel this?  It's like when I'm sober my life is on ""Play"" where as on THC my life is on fast forward.  I wouldn't say weed has cost me anything necessarily (other than lots of $$) but it does feel like if I just stayed stoned things would just keep speeding up to the point that before I know it, I'll be 80 and wondering how the hell my life is already almost over.

At least in the short term, sobriety literally feels like being able to live longer.

2020-09-15 00:24:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/it1ndk/its_been_almost_2_years_and_sometimes_i_still/,It's been almost 2 years and sometimes I still don't feel normal,"I figured this may be the appropriate subreddit to post this in. I'm just wondering if anyone else can relate, or if I'm alone on this topic.

I'm currently 25, soon going on 26. I started using marijuana somewhere around age 13 I believe, and consistently used it up to age 24. I haven't blazed up since December of 2018. The reason I quit is because it was causing me severe depression, anxiety, paranoia, and mood swings. Overall, I felt like if I continued using it, that I would be putting my mental health at risk. It was doing more harm than good.

Now, even though the process of quitting weed has been extremely challenging and painfully difficult at times, being clean has definitely delivered some major upsides. For example, I got my license and started driving. That more than likely probably never would've happened if I continued to use. And there have been many other upsides as well. Quitting has been like a spiritual journey for me. A painful and agonizing journey at times...but still spiritual in many ways. For me, the hardest part is basically just readjusting to life without weed. I can no longer go into denial about my emotions. Now when I feel something, I can't run from it. I have to face it. And yes, that can be really scary. But overall, in the long run, I think it'll benefit me. So in many ways, I really do believe that quitting weed has made me more mature.

But still...sometimes I feel like my mind still isn't all together there. Like I said, I quit because I felt like my mental health was at risk. I was having these bizarre delusional thoughts. Paranoid crazy thoughts. And now even after all the time that has passed, these thoughts still feel very real. Of course, I'm better at keeping these thoughts under some level of control, which is what encourages me to not return to pot. Because I do feel like I've made some genuine progress. But there's still a side of me that feels almost 'permanently internally high'. Like I can't shake this feeling....these thoughts in my head. Honestly, even though I'm clean, sometimes I still feel high.

Is this normal? Did I smoke myself crazy?",11
2020-09-14 23:29:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/it0ssj/the_key_is_managing_your_emotional_life/,The Key is managing your Emotional Life,"I'm 12 days sober, and I've gotten past the point of automatic cravings (that feeling when it's 5 pm and you're like ""time to smoke now?""). I still find myself craving weed, but i'm realizing that it happens most intensely in certain emotional moments.

There's an election in the USA this November, so I decided to volunteer with a group to start calling people in my area to make sure they're registered to vote and knew how to cast their ballot. Today was my first shift calling voters, and most of the people I spoke to were not nice, to say the least. I thought it didn't affect me, but when my shift was over, I felt probably the strongest urge to smoke since I quit. 

It occurred to me that this is because of emotional stress. It was rough putting myself out there to call strangers. People told me to go fuck myself, told me I was a satanist and should be lynched, really crazy stuff. Even though I know it has nothing to do with me personally, and most people are just sick of getting surveys and political calls, it was still no walk in the park. 

My go-to response to emotional stress is to smoke up. For years and years, marijuana has been a way for me to comfort myself and de-stress. I've spent the past four years watching my country fall apart from a stoned-out, numb distance, and I wanted to get involved. But the fact is that if you want to live an active and involved life, you're going to have to get out of your comfort zone, which means being in uncomfortable situations. 

I guess I'm realizing that the key to sobriety is finding healthy strategies to deal with stress and discomfort. To find a different soothing mechanism. And I suppose one of those mechanisms is posting here. 

Hopefully this post will help someone else. But if not, writing it has helped me kind of sort out my own head.",6

Weed is great. A truly wonderful plant it really is. Weed showed me a lot of things. Weed did a lot of great things for me.

I‚Äôve learned after these years of using weed as a crutch/lifestyle that I DESERVE to see what this life is like without pot constantly being a factor. Weed has showed me lots of things, but it‚Äôs time to move on. I got the call, I retained the message, now it‚Äôs time to hang up. 

But it‚Äôs so difficult. I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I have no real reason to quit, other than I know I need to/want to. But I don‚Äôt have a job or career that requires me to stay off the leaves, so therefore, my sober brain always wins, and I end up saying fuck it I‚Äôm not ready to quit.

The other night, I accidentally smoked THC.","I love smoking CBD flower. It‚Äôs not psychoactive and I like the oral fixation. I also think it helps a bit with my anxiety and sleep, but for all I know, that‚Äôs psychosomatic. 

The other night, I bought what I thought was CBD flower and ended up getting high. I could have stopped as soon as I felt the high, but I didn‚Äôt. I ended up smoking the entire joint and binge ate, experienced undesirable personality changes and went to bed way too late. I woke up in a haze and felt completely off the next day. Even my coworkers could see it. But there was something about getting that taste of a high again that sent me reaching for more the next night. And I felt even worse this morning. I‚Äôve been so tired today. Less focused. Hating how I communicated with my husband the night before. 

Yes, I do love escape. But I much prefer life with clarity and energy. Weed, for me, is a life-draining substance. It makes me retract into myself and denies me my fullest potential. 

So, today I start again. Here‚Äôs to a clear mind and a fuller, more engaged life.",87

I loved a dab and pen. Gave up nicotine 3 years ago now and totally changed my smoking habits to vaping dry herbs pretty much only. 

The rona hits and I think hmm wouldn't it be a good time to give this up after spending the last 6 months, jobless locked inside (well I say jobless, I earn money 3d printing and doing other things)  I was close to developing a drinking habit as well, drinking 5-6 6%+ ciders every night for a while. So to say I have an addictive personality is an understatement. 

I cut myself right down with weed for months now, vaping small amounts at a time, but it really just seemed like a habit more than anything, not really getting much out of it. I might have had 2 weeks here and there off while on holiday over the last 20 years but its been really constant abuse. L plates only (2 blue rizlas) or phat bowls used to be the norm, or a triple dab.

I've been there before and know sleep is a pain, but the gut ache is doing me in. Never had it this bad before, almost sicky frog in the throat kind. Not gonna vomit just I know i don't feel right.

I hear a month is required to get off it and that drinking water, fresh veg and fruit (thanks garden!) will be good for me. I want to compete in sporting clays and skeet and I am about 2-3 points of moving up a class so I'm hoping my reaction speeds increase. I never smoke the night before or before a shoot, out of not wanting to have brain fog while shooting. Can anyone confirm if reaction speeds will get better when clean or do they only dull when stoned or with THC in your system?

Its gonna be weeks before I come down from the years of abuse, and I have no one to blame but myself. Weed is that thing that you get caught in, smoking after eating, sex, before a movie, etc its so easy to do and not pay the toll unlike drinking where you certainly will pay a toll instantly (next morning) my stoneovers were always epic, driving while I'm barely awake etc.",6

I know it's going to help me in the long run. I'm proud that I'm taking control. The worst of the withdrawal symptoms subsided within the first week and its been easier since then. My diet is becoming a bit more regular instead of stuffing my face whenever I get the munchies and in turn, my bowel movements have become more regular too. I've dropped about 10 pounds because I'm not snacking on junk food all day and I'm no longer too lazy to make a proper meal with fruits and veggies. My sex drive feels like I'm a teenager again (I'm 29) but that kind of comes and goes. Definitely wasn't prepared for that. Dreams aren't so bad either - which I was dreading as well. 

Ive drastically cut back on drinking at the same time I quit smoking. I've maybe had 1 beer in two weeks and I usually was drinking a few bottles a day before. 

I need to start working out again as I'm 6'4"" and down to about 164lbs (at least there will be very little fat to burn). For reference, I was about 176lbs when I started this journey and I haven't been doing a damn thing but sitting on my ass all day. 

The part about this that sucks the most is that my depression has been horrid these past couple weeks. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have all have their own lives with their own thing going on. I can't remember the last time anyone besides my Dad  reached out to even ask how things were, let alone hang out. And thats been the norm ever since March... I guess even before that too. Realizing that has been pretty tough on my mental state and it makes me want to smoke to forget about it. 

But i realize that's why I'm quitting. I don't want to be complacent with this type of stuff and I don't want to keep running away from my feelings and suppressing them with pot. I will probably need to look into antidepressants at some point.. which is fine. I honestly have lost the motivation to do anything I enjoy (making music, playing video games, going outside to longboard/fish) but that started even when I was smoking so I think its a bigger issue to look into. Anything that can help would be welcomed to at least try. What do I have to lose? 

I'm looking forward to feeling motivated and excited for anything again. I know I have a long ways to go and there's more hurdles to overcome. But I don't ever want to go back to the decade long wake n bake stoner that I used to be. 

No one I know would give a genuine shit about this if I told them. I guess i just wanted to get this off my chest. 

But I also wanted to say thank you to the r/leaves community. I've lurked this sub for months trying to find the courage to finally quit and reading all the posts of people that are also on this journey has helped a lot. 

To anyone thats just starting out or thinking about leaving marijuana behind, you can do it. Take it one day at a time and you'll get there.

Self care is one of them, I check in with myself 3 times a day on an app called Daylio. How am I feeling, what am I thinking about, do I need anything right now?

I'm going to update this daily, but for myself as sort of an open journal to track how I'm feeling, etc. I've tried quitting in the past, and those first couple days suck! Writing it out has always seemed to help, and I might as well do so in a supportive community.

Longish time daily smoker (7-8 years), and it's time for me to quit. With COVID and working from home, I find myself smoking in the morning now. Tolerance is pretty high (no pun intended), and it's not just as fun as it was anymore. It's slowly turned from recreational (college days) to a habit. 

So here we are, last smoked roughly 12 hours ago at a friends, but I've had the mindset of quitting all last week, knowing that Sunday would be the final day (start of NFL was my excuse.. no more excuses now).

The reason I really need to stop -- I have become dependent on it to eat. No high = no appetite. It's been this way for years. I've stopped once a couple years ago and after 10 days or so the appetite was pretty good again! But right now it's very frustrating and honestly, embarrassing. If I try to eat without smoking, I tend to get nauseous at the first bite. It has affected how I hang out with friends, go on dates, etc. Yeah, that's a problem that I need to address. I have severe GERD and I believe smoking daily (and also frequent fast food during college) was a major factor in this. 

So here we go. I have smoothie stuff ready to go, fresh fruit, Greek yogurt, and also a few small single serving portions of Wegmans grain bowls. Also for now, since my appetite will be low, I will be taking a multi-vitamin. I'm 5'9 and 145lbs so while I'm trying to stick to some low-fat foods for now, I need to be conscious of my weight.

-----

Day 1: I smoked last night, so I don't expect the worst of the symptoms to hit for another day or two. Had a small bowl of cereal and a glass of cranberry juice so far today, but it's still the morning. Lunch time in a bit, so I'll update later on. Lunch update: Jimmy Dean's Sausage Egg and Cheese wrap in a burrito. Not the best for lunch but it's at least something. Dinner - Just a few carrots :(

Day 2: Cool, made it a day. Had a banana this morning and an Egg McMuffin so far since I was out of the house. Down under 140lbs though... Had a Healthy Choice BBQ beef wrap for lunch (honestly was pretty good), and just sipping on water now. Nausea has been in and out all day. Spitting up a lot of clear phlegm (especially this morning!) but with black specs, which is telling me my body is cleaning itself. Half a chicken breast for dinner.

Day 3: Woke up pretty sweaty around 4am, which was weird given that this morning my heat finally kicked on.. it's getting chilly! I am getting a bit agitated over things I that normally wouldn't bother me, but I'm catching this pretty quick and am able to take a few deep breaths and calm down. Breakfast: Sausage Egg Cheese burrito wrap and a glass of organic cranberry juice diluted with water.

Day 4: I can already feel myself improving. Had one of those instant breakfast drinks with protein AND a sausage egg and cheese wrap for breakfast. A pretty good sized turkey sandwich for lunch.. it's almost 5:30PM and I think I feel a slight hunger coming on? Woke up again last night sweating, but not as bad as yesterday. The urges to smoke have not been so strong today, and despite being a busy day at work, things went well. Grounded app so far tells me 3d 19h has saved me ~$20 (about 11.5 bong packs!)..

If anyone has advice on curbing the nausea or stimulating an appetite, let me know! I've also reached out to my Doctor for advice but waiting to hear back. EDIT - Dr told me to drink cold clear fluids and easy to digest foods for the next few days, but otherwise basically told me to tough it out.

I'm trying to figure out if there underlying issues that don't let me quit that easely. I used to be a very anxious, agresive person before I smoked weed. It occur to me that I might be resentful about my life and that's the real reason I can't quit. Life have not been all wish for, especially in the emotional realm,  with some ups, but with mayor downs as well.

I think that I had a toxic relationship with my father, I was bullyed at school, have difficult time making community with others, It's difficult for me to mantain a girldfriend or relationships in general.

I am scared I haven‚Äôt hit my bottom. I smoke habitually, and don‚Äôt want to, but I feel like my life isn‚Äôt too unmanageable. I‚Äôm depressed, and I‚Äôm afraid smoking isn‚Äôt going to help, in fact I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll exasperate my depression, but alas, I‚Äôm going to give it a try. 
I‚Äôm also mostly afraid of not being able to be creative- I play music and am nervous this will be lost. I‚Äôve quit before for short periods of time and had this experience of feeling stuck, stupid, and uncreative. 
Anyways, I guess I‚Äôm looking for positives people gain due to sobriety.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a handle on it and the weed turned into alcohol turned into coke (thankfully got out of that relatively quickly). I am sober from alcohol and coke, but as always, the weed is my greatest hurdle.

I'm broke and all the usual alternatives for getting weed are off the table. So I'm gonna try so hard. I am married now, I have a wonderful job I love, I feel more emotionally stable. I have no reason to keep smoking. But I've proven to myself in the last seven years that I don't need a reason, just an opportunity.

I've been reading these stories for the past hour and it's helping me face some things I haven't wanted to face. I decided I should put how I'm feeling right now into writing before I dismiss it....I also hope it might help someone someday - as all of your posts are really helping me. 

I've known for a long time that im probably addicted but haven't wanted to admit it. My husband and I have smoked every day for the past...probably 3 or 4 years (wow it's really been that long.) 

It's incredibly hard to see an addiction for what it is when it's as stealthy as cannabis. I have a good job, live comfortably, only a little overweight, have an incredible marriage, but I feel like I haven't been fully awake for the past 4 years. 

Like I haven't been living but life has just been happening to me. 

Slowly I've given up all my hobbies, binge eat every night, barely excersice let alone stand, barely talk to or visit my family, barely socialize in general. I feel like the only two things I've continued to care about are my job and my husband. Nothing else in my life really matters that much to me anymore. I've never been so apathetic and now...I barely remember what passion feels like. 

I've had some nights where I briefly ""wake up"" from my haze, realize that I've completely lost my sense of self, fall into a pit of despair, cry it out, smoke dope, feel 'great' and also so stupid for even thinking like that and being that dramatic, and continue to go about my regular scheduled life...how many times an I going to repeat this before I realize I have to stop? My husband is also a daily smoker...how is quitting going to affect our marriage? How am I going to deal with reality and anxiety and depression again without weed?

I always catch myself thinking ""maybe I'll quit...but then again why do even need to my life is great, it's not that bad for you, you can't actually get addicted, what's a small joint once a day? I've worked so hard this morning I deserve this."" These are shitty addict thoughts aren't they? 

Idk I feel like I just needed to say all this somewhere. This sub has really opened my eyes to what I need to do, what I keep running away from. I'm honestly terrified to quit, not sure I can face life without it.  I think I'm going to try...I really want to try.

I started smoking weed when I was 17 and now I‚Äôm almost 32. The longest I ever went not smoking was 1 week and that‚Äôs only because I got busted for weed and got locked up for 1 week back in 2012. I‚Äôve always known I don‚Äôt want to smoke trees for the rest of my life but just never made or could make the decision to stop. Now I live in a legal state where it‚Äôs just as easy to buy an 8th as it is to buy gas or groceries. I added it up and I was spending close to $1000/month on it. But honestly saving money is not why I‚Äôm trying to stop. It‚Äôs now been 3 full days with no weed. I know that ain‚Äôt shit to brag about but I‚Äôm actually surprised that I‚Äôve been able to go that long. Fuck what everyone says. It is addictive. It makes u feel like it‚Äôs ok that you‚Äôre not successful. It makes u not give a fuck if you‚Äôre mediocre. It makes time pass by so quick and makes u feel like u can binge watch tv not workout and eat whatever the fuck u want. I hate to say this but the only reason I‚Äôve been able to stop this long is because I told myself I‚Äôm taking a 30 day break and once that‚Äôs over I can go back and start smoking again and will get high like I used to when I barely started. Please comment why I shouldn‚Äôt. I want to change. I want my ambition and drive back. I know I‚Äôm capable of big things but I fell in love with weed and now don‚Äôt know if I have the strength not to relapse. People get anxious when they smoke. But I have never been more anxious in my life than these past three days. Plus I now stare at my ceiling literally unable to go to sleep. I‚Äôve never posted here before and as I type this I want to delete everything and say never mind but tbh I have no one else to talk to or ask for words of encouragement.. please tell me why I shouldn‚Äôt start up again..,9

It's getting harder but it's worth it,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this subreddit but I've been a lurker for a few weeks now as I worked up the courage to finally try and quit. This post may be a bit of a ramble but I feel like it will help me continue with this journey if I share my experience so far with others. If anything I have said in this post is against the rules please let me know so I can correct it.

I'm on day 7 today. It's been a real struggle and it feels like its getting worse.

 I started smoking 13 years ago at the age of 12 and I've been a heavy, everyday user since I was 17.

Up until last week I'd smoke probably 2 grams every morning before work, I would even have cigarettes rolled up with a bit of oil in them for my lunch breaks nearly every day and then once I'm home at the end of the day I'd stay up till the early morning just smoking, playing games and eating as much crap as I wanted, my average spending on bud a week has been close to $450 AUD for a long time (an ounce averages a price of $300 where I live) which is nearly half of my weekly pay.

I decided it was time to quit, not only because of how much money I waste every year, but Because I was diagnosed with acute stress disorder after the the bush fires on NYE, the anxiety I developed from that has never left me, add smoking heavily on-top of that and my life has been a constant state of anxiety for the last nine months. It's no way for someone to live their life.

The last 7 days have been great in some ways and less than stellar in others. 

Having clarity in my head and feeling like my brain isn't clouded has given me a lot of motivation that I forgot I had,  I've not only stopped craving so much junk food and started eating smaller, healthier meals, but my motivation is back, I've been riding my bike every day and doing a lot of cardio exercises ( I've already lost 5kg in the 7 days alone). this has been unbelievably good for my anxiety, instead of feeling anxious the whole day and usually having a panic attack every night after some heavy smoking, I've had one panic attack the last 7 days and my anxiety is so much more manageable now. this is a fantastic feeling and it is great motivation for myself to keep moving forward with this change in my life.

on the other hand but. some of my withdrawal symptoms and cravings have been making the days very hard to cope with, even with all the positives I'm feeling

I am so used to weed being a massive part in my life that when I think about spending the rest of my life without it almost feels sad. like it's a part of my life that I will miss dearly when it's gone, like its a good friend I'll never see again. has anyone else ever felt this way?

the two main things that have been making this change in my life one of the hardest thing I've ever done are

1. The cravings. 
2. the environment

I don't know if its because I've smoked for so long, but the cravings I've been experiencing are very strong. almost too strong. although it's not at the front of my mind all day, when I do think about having a puff the urge becomes so strong that I can't focus on whatever I'm doing at home/work and I'll start to pace around thinking about nothing but having a smoke and these feelings have been getting stronger and stronger the last few days.

It doesn't help that my misses, whom I live with, is still a smoker, It's never been an issue for her, she just likes a puff every now and then,  I am lucky that she is kind and supportive enough to now smoke outside in the shed down the back and she wont go out for a smoke when I'm home.  the problem is I know where she keeps her stash and when I'm home alone all I can think about is going down to the back shed and having a hit. the urge is so intensely strong that it reminds me of my days as a recovering Xanax addict in my early 20's, the urges and the thoughts of using becoming so strong it almost becomes a form of pain.

 the one thing that has so far stopped me from have a smoke again is the support Ive been getting from all my friends (who most still smoke) and my family. without the support from everyone I'm not sure if I would've even lasted 3 days. when I want to just go and have a smoke I think of how I don't want to disappoint anyone, especially my parents who have been very supportive of me. It may not stop my cravings but it helps give me the will to put up with it. I just hope they don't last much longer

If you have taken the time to read this, thank you. I know its a bit of a rambling but I think to share my experience and how I'm feeling with others who are quitting like myself or are already quitters will help my will and motivations to continue this journey.

Good Luck to everyone else out there trying to kick the habit",4
2020-09-13 23:36:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/isd8ch/its_a_slow_progress/,it's a slow progress,"Hello I've been clean from weed for 2 months now. One thing I was somewhat disappointed in is the fact that it didn't actually make the sudden improvement that I expected.  I honestly don't feel different at all.  Which is good.  I can feel the same without weed. 

I'm still trying to figure out what I was running from with weed. I'm realizing I have a lot of coping machenisms outside of weed.  Weed just made my mind foggy so I didn't realize how I was protecting my insecurities.  I gotta say it's awkward and uncomfortable.  If you want to improve your outlook on life drop the bowl and don't stop there.  

Some noticeable improvments I've had:

-I have a strong appitite and don't rely on weed to eat.  

-I work out until the demons are gone

-laser beam focus on everything I do 

-I talk to my family and friends with care

-I don't lie to myself",7

It had reached his brain and there was nothing we could do but put him down to stop the pain. He was unresponsive after going into a massive seizure. The whole situation was very sudden and heartbreaking. 

I have two much older siblings and they were not around much when I was growing up due to my sister going away to boarding school for high school and then college, and my brother hanging with his friends and not being at home very often. I can‚Äôt blame them for that. So my dog was my best friend and we grew up together. Got him in the 4th grade and now I‚Äôm heading into my first year of college. I had a feeling that night before that he was going to leave me the next day. I began to regret all the moments in my life where I was too high to even care about the value of them and was more focused on going to my room to smoke. Every day from sophomore year till two weeks ago I smoked(besides for a few attempts to quick with the longest lasting 2 weeks max). In general, I regretted all the wasted potential for a stupid habit. My dog passing, in a sort of weird twisted way, was the catalyst that made me decide I‚Äôm done once and for all. No more wasted moments. 

The last few times I quit, I didn‚Äôt have too severe of reactions. This time I‚Äôm noticing 17 days out that my lungs have not healed. I have severe pressure in my chest and I cannot play basketball without giving up after a few possessions. My rem sleep has come back but nowhere near as intense as it has in the past. I definitely smoked a lot this summer. I was doing crackhead shit like dabbing off of spoons, using carts that I knew were fake, etc. So I understand why my chest would be in so much pain. But this is the longest i‚Äôve went and i still feel like shit? I still feel the anxiety from weed and I still don‚Äôt get proper sleep and my lungs feel terrible, worse than when I was actually smoking. 

My brother claims that since I am serious about quitting this time, my body is getting ready for a huge release of all the toxins. I don‚Äôt know how scientifically accurate that is. I know quitting weed is not a magical key to feeling great, but it is part of it. I‚Äôm doing this for myself, my dog, and the people around me. I just hope that I haven‚Äôt self induced asthma or some shit because if so the world just loves to play these cruel tricks on me. 

tldr; quit weed because i regretted wasting moments and my dog passing pushed me to do it once and for all. 17 days out my body feels like absolute shit. do i need to chill and wait it out or should i be concerned?",23

Right, so I made this acc specifically to chat to you guys. I'm 26 years old and have been a chronic smoker for 7 years - 4 of them evening-only smoke binges on the daily, and the previous 3 just being all day sessions of varying intensity (think about 3.5Gs per week, give or take another half). I'm now 5 days sober and - pray with me - never going back. I've been reading this form excessively for motivation and tips on dealing with it and have taken as much to heart as I possibly can (you guys fucking rock, seriously): I have cut sugar nearly completely (Barring tea - I'm British ffs), changed my diet, begun exercising myself out of this blob-like mass I'm stuck living in and overall, for the short amount of time I've managed it so far, I feel pretty fantastic. As I write this, I've just finished a 45 minute workout and it's the best my body has felt since I was about 19 (10/10 would nearly pass out on the floor again).

So what the hell am I writing this essay for? Well, in a thread a while back, someone asserted that weed causes Aphasia - an inability to form coherent sentences or process your thoughts quick enough in conversations (resulting in glorious dead air! /s). This can manifest as slurred speech, frequent misuse of words/grammar/language and (the biggie) forming coherent, spontaneous sentences.

Now, from reading the above - this is me. And from reading about 200 threads on this forum (yeah, really), it's a lot of you too - you, like me, just didn't know how to identify it.

So, I'm here for reassurance in some way - or at least the comforting knowledge of knowing what I have lying ahead - and I want to know your experience with this.

1: Brain fog is obviously and rightly discussed by everyone on here. But breaking it down into this particular area of fogginess, what has been your experience with socialising, speaking and general fluidity in forming more complex, spontaneous sentences since quitting? Has it improved? Worsened? Or just stopped bothering you?

2: If it stopped, how long did it take? What helped you kill it?

3: If it didn't (or hasn't yet), how have you learned to cope? Especially in regards to dating and socialising? Do you see slow improvements that could build to a full recovery, or do you feel the damage has been permanent? (<<<Unsurprisingly, I'm particularly interested in this question. Kind of terrified...)

4: Or do you see this as a wider symptom of brain fog from chronic use, and separate from Aphasia as an actual neurological disorder? If so, why and what experience did you have that made you realise it could be differentiated?

5: Generally, is full recovery possible? What do you think? What did you go through?

All of you are doing brilliantly, and I'm in awe of how well some of you handle it. Seriously, keep at it, and if there's anything I can answer then you just gotta let me know.

It would come on immediately after eating anything (especially foods that are common gut irritants) and soon got to the point where I was experiencing extreme fatigue and stomach upset after eating as well. Thinking back on the timeline, it's possible that it started after I began smoking and I'm wondering if weed was the cause all along. There was a period of time where my brain fog lessened and seemed to go away and I was able to eat whatever I wanted again, and I think that coincides with when I wasn't really smoking at all. Then all the symptoms came back with a vengeance after I got heavy into edibles and vaping. I never linked the two together until I found out that weed can cause horrible stomach upset and saw a bunch of people here mentioning brain fog.

I'm on day 2 and sitting here with awful head-pressure brain fog after eating a few pieces of bacon, so I was curious to see if anyone else notices that their fog comes on immediately or soon after eating?",1

Its crazy to think about but last night I was so bored all I could think about was rolling a joint and smoking it. So I ended up hitting my dealer up for some bud.

2020-09-13 19:25:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/is9863/three_months/,Three months,"Tomorrow marks my 3 month milestone. I celebrated this weekend by challenging myself to a 32km two day hike through the forest. 

For those of you in the beginning stages please know that things get better. The negative of withdrawal is only temporary. It always helps me when others have shared their timeline experience, so I'll do the same. 

Month 1: overall not fun, but tolerable. Suffered headaches, apathy, unstable mood, cravings, fatigue and general feelings of being unwell. It helped me to focus on my new lifestyle, one without weed. I took care of myself. Napped when needed, lots of hot baths to help my emotions and set my personal expectations to something I knew I could achieve. My general productivity went down.

Month 2: things starting to get better. Sleep schedule was more normal, appetite returned and my mood was definitely better than month 1, though still some low points. I focused on introspection and trying to develop better habits that facilitated the lifestyle I'm heading for. Cravings slowed down a lot and I stopped thinking about weed as much as I had been.

Month 3: the biggest improvements occurred here. I feel like my brain, after having been battered for two decades, is starting to heal. I feel more normal. Cravings now are basically just fleeting thoughts. One thing I did notice during this time though was that I did miss weed a bit in times when I would have used it for its medicinal properties. I found other ways to cope. I focused on resuming a normal life and continued to take steps to become the person I want to be. 

It's been a ride. I'm definitely a much more stable, available and predictable person now. There are regrets I didn't do this a long time ago. I'm 40 and wish I wouldn't have wasted as many years as I did but I'm happily taking the opportunity to turn things around now. 

Thanks to the members of this group. It's the most active group I have found and people have been very supportive. I also find it therapeutic to offer my advice and help those when I can.

What things have you avoided? Looking back, how do you think you would have felt experiencing those things?","I am a vertan when it comes to quitting. I was always shy and kept to myself and didn't open up to people so marijuana was my drug. It made being in my room bored and alone, ok to do. It made spending 10 hours on the computer/video games bearable. Here's things that I regret passing up on because of smoking

1. Valentines day 2015 - passed up on hooking up with a girl because I was nervous. Smoking myself to oblivion. Ended up jerking off and playing games. 

2. Left my friends party early on new years day 2018 because I felt anxious. I hadn't smoked that day and by night, I was feeling a little sick. I made up an excuse, left ALL my friends, and went home and got high. 

3. Neglected my CPA exam while people around me and stupider than me have passed the exam 

4. Lack of dating - lead me to be extremely lonely now at 29.

5. Passing up on talking to this girl who lives like 70 miles from me. Keep telling myself it's not gonna work and I just smoke and push all my responsibilities to the side. 

6. Quarantine - wasted so much time. Time could have been spent looking for a new job, studying for the exam, getting into good shape, etc etc. I have sat around getting high for 3 months straight. 

7. Living in another city for a year or two - I think this ship has possibly sailed. Weed just put everything on hold. I've kept the same job and done the same thing. Not to say I haven't moved up the ladder and am not doing good at my job, I just haven't grown personally.  Makes it hard to try new things due to fear of stepping out of my comfort zone

8. Haven't read at all. When I was sober from April - June, I fell in love with reading. I really enjoyed it. Started smoking in June and I haven't touched my book at all. 

9. No consistency with diet - my body looks the same as it did 5 years ago. 

10. No learning new stuff that could help my career. I want to pass my CPA, possibly learn python, join a new company, etc etc. I want to see what else is out there cause I am a smart guy. 

11. Single af and lonely. I expect the world to give me stuff and girls to be delivered to me. No, I need to go out and date. I need to go out and find a girl, that's how it is. 

12. I've neglected playing tennis, basketball, riding my bike, and getting into running. 

13. I developed a porn addiction

14. Weed stops me from getting closer to my own family. My brother is engaged and I want to spend more time with him and his fiance. I want to get to know my new sister. I also want to spend time with my 63 year old dad. I want to cry thinking about my parents. I just want to spend time with them, they're amazing. They want the best for me but I feel like a fucking failure and I avoid them. 

15. Consistency - weed stops me from forming any sort of consistency in my life. 

16. I wasted aka not lived up to my potential EVER in my life. Until about 24/25, I was in a shell. Then I started to developed and mature. Because of that, I could have gone on to do great things but I didn't. I discovered weed at 22 and haven't looked back. I wasted my 20's on this shit. 

17. It has made me hate myself. I know I am an awesome person and I feel that way whenever I quit and sober up. My confidence is at 100 and I kill it in life. I am social, I have fun, I love making people feel good. When I was sober, I would always tell myself, ""my heart if full of love"" because all I loved doing was making people feel loved and it made me feel so good. I haven't said that to myself in 2 years or so. 

18. Keeps me in my shell - I avoid new things at all costs. New experiences, new tv show, new hobbies, etc etc. 

19. Succeeding in life - I have SO many friends and family that just want me to do well and want to see me happy. I haven't been doing that. I want to boast my accomplishments but I have nothing. 

20. My side hobbies that could make me money never went anywhere. I could have made money or a side business if I focused back in 2013. It's much harder to do it now. 

21. It has made me paranoid

22. It has given me anxiety

Very unlikely I'll get evacuated, but this is still effed up, and our city has a heavy cloud of forest fire smoke, and we have unprecedented levels of particles in our air. Everyone is getting a fan and a furnace filter to rig together a system and filter the air in their homes, because you just CAN'T keep all the smoke out. 

I'm easily one of the most well off among everyone near the fires, so don't get me wrong, this will pass soon enough and my life will go back to normal -- it's from an empathizing angle, ya know, and when I'm sober it's really hard to keep everything that's happening out of my mind. I also have to wear a respirator inside my own house if I don't chill in the room with the filtration system or I get a headache, sooo yeah, just wanted to share.

I have had little desire to smoke and I have been able to talk myself out of the few urges I have had. 

I have been a daily smoker for 8 years at least, I never really imagined Id quit. I lived in this facade where I was healthy and happy and successful, but I was really addicted to pot and really good at lying to myself. I quit cigarettes in March and started getting treatment for codependency a few months ago. It‚Äôs been a huge period of self actualization.

Now comes the hard part. The emotional detox, or withdrawal. The first week I had no appetite and barely slept. I found myself ending all of these toxic friendships and finally learning how to set boundaries compassionately. I realized I didn‚Äôt even know myself before because I was high all the time. 

The 2nd and third week my anxiety levels were so high and I was so irritable. Then, the forth week I felt so unreasonably angry all the time. It‚Äôs like ten years of suppressed anger was bubbling up. Week five I was weeping every night. 

I hit a plateau where I felt a bit numb, and then at the end of week five the depression hit hard. It started with some melancholy feelings and then by week six I had the suicidal thoughts creep back in. I was so weak mentally I could barely even do my daily stretching routine. Crying the whole time.

I‚Äôm not actually suicidal, let me say. I just feel like my whole life has been a waste. I spent the last decade high. I feel like my life is just starting at 25 and it feels like I have thrown away so much valuable time. I barely even know what my dreams are and I sure don‚Äôt have the confidence to pursue them. I feel so hopeless. I have been unemployed for months now and I am living in my friends basement. 

I am accepting a job offer tomorrow, it‚Äôs not a dream job but it should get me into a place of my own and a new car. I guess I‚Äôm just terrified I‚Äôll fuck it all up. I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôs too late to follow my dreams and that I have permanently damaged my brain from drugs and drinking. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll always be depressed and that quitting just pulled back the veil on my bad mental health situation. Thanks to anyone who reads this, I had a really really hard night last night. Seeing people I used to be friends with be successful makes me feel especially like a piece of garbage.

Day before I smoked again because of similar depressive and lonely feelings to ease my pain/hurt. 
I went to a psychiatrist and I wasn't happy with his English and the office. He suggest 8 sessions in two months and serotonin drugs. He also asked me to get a few tests done. I checked back with my family doctor and he said he would take me to the top psychiatrist in the city and asked me to stay away from weed. I'm just wondering why am I getting so depressed. I wake up in the morning to pee and when I try to get back to sleep my mind starts racing with these uncontrollable thoughts. And my feet feel restless. And I struggle that way for an hour or two, all the time trying to get back to sleep, fighting those those thoughts and my restless legs. Please let me know if anyone has specifically or generally felt that way after quitting weed. Also the loneliness , feelings of low self worth, low self esteem, self doubt, thoughts about wasting my good years, fear of the future, that I will not amount to anything.

If I did dream, they were often vague and abstract and after waking up the memory would fade really quickly, as is normal. Often times I could tell that I was dreaming. 

Well, like many of you I became a daily smoker, for between 2-3 years total. Weed definitely made it easier to fall asleep and I sometimes dreamed and sometimes didn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve been sober for 3 months or so atm, so it‚Äôs definitely out of my system. I can fall asleep and eat easily (unlike when I was having withdrawals in the 2 weeks after quitting). But I still have extremely vivid dreams every single night. I can‚Äôt sleep without dreaming. Sometimes they‚Äôre so realistic that I don‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs a dream until I wake up, which really sucks when it‚Äôs a stressful dream. I can often remember a ton of details when I wake up. My mind and body still seem to be getting enough rest, I feel like I function fine, but sleep itself doesn‚Äôt *feel* as restful. I used to love sleeping :( I took a 30 min nap earlier and started having a dream. 

I guess my fear is that this isn‚Äôt common, and I kinda messed with my brain by being a daily smoker while my brain was developing (I‚Äôm 20). I‚Äôm not planning on ever smoking weed again - I can‚Äôt moderate, and the career I‚Äôm working towards drug tests. So I‚Äôm worried that I won‚Äôt have a dreamless sleep for the rest of my life.

To complicate it, we've become lovers and had some drama surrounding that. My libido is dead and I don't want to have sex, but his sexual appetite is insatiable so he's been kind of bitter about that.

Is this normal?,"So i stopped smoking weed and it‚Äôs been a month and a half, and it‚Äôs been a pretty good linkage between my one friend and I. I had probably not gone a week without smoking for 1-2 years and so I just feel like the curtains got pulled and different parts of my personality have been more prudent.

For one, I‚Äôm just much more intense now or I just feel things greatly, I noticed that I‚Äôm much more angry but motivated, and I‚Äôm less likely to let shit slide. My friend would call me goofy and gumpy (which is basically like dorky and uncoordinated), and the first thing he said when I saw him again after not smoking was that I seemed less goofy.

And I‚Äôm a naturally chill guy but I just didn‚Äôt have my edge which I think caused people to not take me seriously. Anyways this brings me to when recently I got into it physically when this different friend blindly pushed me while playing basketball and I was shoving the fuck out of him until he backed off, while when I was a stoner I probably just wouldn‚Äôt have cared but I was just ready to literally beat his ass and I just have a lot more tension in me which I guess is both good and bad.

And so I feel myself hanging out with this group of friends less and less, and I kind of feel the connection is starting to drift in someways, but at the same time I just don‚Äôt feel like hanging out with them that much and they‚Äôre starting to annoy me in some aspects. 

Also hanging out with them isn‚Äôt as fun anymore and I just don‚Äôt vibe with them as well and like I started to do boxing, and the boxing gym has welcomed me and I like the community there. 

So in summary, like a lot of things are happening and Im honestly just getting tired of hanging out with them, and I don‚Äôt like the fact that I‚Äôm not invited to certain things (like today they went to play basketball and I wouldn‚Äôt have gone but the invitation wasn‚Äôt even there). There‚Äôs starting to be drama within the friend group, I also got a job during all this, Im taking a full course load an engineering student, I‚Äôm going to box 3 times a week, and I feel like in some ways this isn‚Äôt my crowd anymore.

I‚Äôm going through so many changes and weed has to do with some of them bc I probably would‚Äôve just kept living the same life if I would‚Äôve still been a stoner, and I never would‚Äôve have gone after what I wanted.

If I could offer any advise to those struggling it is this little mantra I thought of a little while back.  'dont chase the dragon, realize you are the dragon'.  Basicly what this means to me is that we are always chasing happiness through drugs but what we have to realize is happiness comes from within.  A big part for me was I always thought I had to smoke to enjoy things or things would be better if I just smoked.  Coming to the realization that things weren't actually better when I smoked but actually worse(brain fog, munchies, passing out etc.) helped me in my worst times.

To anyone else out there struggling- you got this!","I'm happy to say that the time's I'm using are getting shorter and shorter compared to the times I'm sober.

I went 5 months from the end of September  to February. I'd started to use only a few times and then coronavirus hit and it quickly spiraled into everyday. At first I was okay with it. I felt success in having figured out the root of why I am addicted to weed through counselling during my 5 months of sobriety.

Basically I'd figured out that due to the neglect I experienced as a child from having an alcoholic parent, I grew up really fast in order to survive. I became a little adult child who didn't know how to have fun anymore. When I actually grew up, smoking weed was my way of allowing my inner child to come out and have fun. However, as I'm sure most of you know, smoking weed is not a sustainable approach to meeting needs. So my challenge has been to learn how to have fun in healthy ways. Not a bad problem to have in the grand scheme of things! :)

So back to trying to get through this pandemic like everyone else and I'm back to smoking weed everyday again. I tell myself it helps me focus better on doing my work from home. It's fine for awhile until August rolls around and I have a few traumatic things come up in my relationships. Things really spiraled down then and I began smoking all the time just to feel alive. It sucked, big time! Being in a haze where you don't even feel like it's a choice anymore. Bleh. It's not even fun at that point.... just depressing.

Enough was enough, after 4 months of being back at it, it was time to quit again! This time for good. So I did in early August and have been clean for 26 days. In the first week I felt really good. No problems! Then week two I was having issues sleeping and feeling stressed out. Week 3/4 I started to feel physically depressed, no energy and I just wanted to eat all the time. It started to turn into mental and emotional depression as well. I couldn't focus and felt like I wasn't getting anything done. My sense of self worth really started to drop.

Thankfully things have started to turn around week 5 and wow am I feeling so relieved! I've gotten so much work done this week and can actually focus on what I want to do. I feel calm and centered with a relatively positive outlook on life. My lungs still feel a bit weird but I'm sure that will take time to get better. 

So really I just want to say to anyone who's reading, you've got this! Sometimes it feels really hard and you might relapse or you might have intense cravings. But I promise you it's worth it! For the past two weeks I was really starting to question whether or not I would need weed for the rest of my life just to feel good. Now I can say for sure that this is not true! Things will ebb and flow, but I can promise that in the long run you will feel better not being addicted to weed.

I‚Äôve always had depressive feeling, already since I can remember but won‚Äôt consider myself severely depressed. I‚Äôm just wired that way. I don‚Äôt think quitting weed will make this disappear, but it will make life more easy.

After 13 days I feel empty and crave a joint. On a Friday night without any social plans I feel like a joint to relax wouldn‚Äôt do that much harm. I‚Äôm quite an introvert, i do enjoy social interaction but don‚Äôt need a weekend filled with social activities. 

Right now I‚Äôm so unsure whether this is just me being stupid and ignorant, or whether it‚Äôs worth giving it a shot. Maybe I can enjoy 1 or 2 joints a week when I don‚Äôt need to work the next day. Or maybe I can‚Äôt and this is the way to find out. I just don‚Äôt want to keep craving a joint every single day and living forward to this moment on a daily base. Can really use your advice on this one, because I don‚Äôt want to fall back in this old pattern.",3

I was a chronic user since 15 and I am now 24. I have been suffering through brutal depression and anxiety for years. I quit smoking weed once before for 4 months and my anxiety got soooo much better after the withdrawals. That was 2 years ago. I've smoked every day since then. I feel like a prisoner to weed. I know I feel better without it but everything in my body is telling me SMOOOKKEE BITCH. Ya know? lol. I am looking for support or encouragement. I know I can keep going and quit again. The withdrawals are gnarly though. And I just started my last year of my undergrad which is stressful. My usual way of coping with stress is smoking weed, but I know I can replace it with healthier habits. Does anyone feel empty without weed? The feeling sucks so much. I know it eventually wears off though.",21

I started smoking around 5-6 years ago. Since January I have let my smoking habits get out of control. I start smoking around 10:30-11 in the morning and do not stop until sometimes after 12 at night. Generally, I am out every hour smoking either a joint or from the bong. Occasionally, I‚Äôll do some dabs if I‚Äôm running low on herb. 

Recently, I‚Äôve really noticed this starting to negatively impact my health. I wake up and just can not wait to smoke. If I go on about my day and do not smoke until later in the day, I feel dizzy, nauseous, and dull. It‚Äôs sort of like I need to smoke to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I guess that‚Äôs because it is my normal. But the amount of money and the way I feel when I don‚Äôt smoke makes me really want to quit. I‚Äôm struggling because I do love smoking weed so much, but with life starting to return to normal after quarantine (in the aspect that I am going back to school and work) I do not want to be feeling awful all day until whenever I can smoke again. I‚Äôve tried cutting back, I‚Äôve tried quitting cold turkey. It never lasts for more then a few hours. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or stories on how they quit smoking if you were as addicted as me?",2

I'm having dreams again and I'm reconnecting with my sisters and brother after the death of our parents. I'm planning on moving in with my eldest sister once my lease is up.

I stopped smoking after I realized I couldn't remember my mother's face anymore. It scared me to death that my brain was in such a fog that I could not see her in my mind eye. I felt like I was getting dementia and like I was delirious. I got so angry I destroyed my pens, threw my grinder into the dumpster and flushed all my weed. I dreamt about my mother for the first time since the funeral yesterday and its bittersweet. That helped me reassured that I'm not losing my memories. 

I'm planning on saving money to see a therapist. I still have anxiety and paranoia but I can finally calm myself down. I think moving in with my sister will help me in this aspect along with seeing a professional. 
I feel like a fool for running away from home and from my family 5 years ago under the pretense of not wanting to see mother everywhere I go. After quitting I notice I worry alot now and I feel like I wasted my so much time. But I know that these worries will be a part of me until I make peace. 

Is worrying and being depressed common? I feel like the most common thing here is urges and relapses but whenever I get an urge I'm scared of losing my mind and it makes me adamant to stay sober. I also feel dizziness like as if I'm high whenever I lay down for bed, it scares me so much that I've to get up and calm myself before trying again. I also get scared that I can't recall some things before I started getting high, like the map layout of my hometown or my mother's cooking.

So far no noticeable withdrawal symptoms today besides a little fatigue and a slight headache. Appetite is back to full swing, mood seems pretty stable and so far so good. I got hit with a huge dizzy spell around this time yesterday, so fingers crossed that none of that happens today.

I'm spending so much more time with my family, especially my dad and it feels wonderful. I used to be in my room all the time blazed, and now I actually want to be around my loved ones all the time. I feel so much happier because of this especially.

I also finally booked a psychiatry appointment today after years of fluctuating mental health!! Weed has always been my crutch for 'helping' me mentally, until I realized it was making everything much worse. 

I'm making huge steps in changing my life for the better, the first step being sobriety and the second step getting professional mental help.

And now we're caught up on the ""why"" I'm here I'll get to my point...*


I don't know about anyone else but I used to get really angry. Whether it was due to the weed itself in a chemical sense or due to me using weed to suppress things I'd be walking round in a rage I'd say 50% of the time. Probably more if I'm honest...


I've noticed now in the main part that's pretty much gone. Don't get me wrong I still get narked but it's now very rare I RAGE. I remember when things would trigger me and I'd then immediately run off (or as soon as I could) and smoke to relieve that tension.


On Wednesday I got super cross. And if I'm honest? Using didn't even cross my mind. Now I'm not saying I dealt with it perfectly, in fact I pretty much had a toddler tantrum and it ruined the rest of my day (which included listening to emo music and eating chocolate, as you do...) but once I'd settled I kind of took stock of what had happened and moved on. It didn't follow me into the next day like it did when I used. It didn't build and build. 


And in a now seemingly common event for me after a bad day the next day not only did I feel calm and okay but this time for the first time since the pink cloud left I actually felt happy after the bad day. A feeling that remains today too. 


So that brings me to the bonding questions... How's everyone else's tempers doing? Has anyone else notified a lack in residual anger since stopping? Created new ways to channel that emotion?


Anyways anger aside, see you all tomorrow for my 7 months sober check in, happy Friday and have a wonderful (and hopefully tantrum free) weekend.


And, as always, stay strong ü§é",19
2020-09-11 06:14:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iqnsh1/reflecting_on_6_months_sobriety/,Reflecting on 6+ months sobriety,"I haven't smoked weed for 6 months and 12 days after being almost the whole time a daily smoker for 10, 11 years. I started in high school at 15 (26 now).

I think weed can be a positive thing for some people, and I appreciate the lessons that it taught me and led me to learn. However, for last 5 years I think I had wanted to quit, while I kept toking away. Since I had been preparing myself to quit for years, how I quit in the end was very straight-forward. A friend of mine (who lives in a different country) quit and I latched onto his example and quit myself. I downloaded an app that told me how much money I would save and so on, which was a great source of motivation.


Instead of talking about how it affected me I will try to talk about how I am without it now.

I have a history of depression and I always thought that moodiness and mood swings were part of me. I had a pretty high [negative affectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_affectivity#:~:text=Negative%20affectivity%20\(NA\)%2C%20or,guilt%2C%20fear%2C%20and%20nervousness.). Before I got sober, I did not realize how little it takes for me to be happy or in a decent mood. Nowadays, I am not easily irritated and more forgiving. I am happier, more loving, able to feel love and give it back. 

These positive effects did not take long to show themselves. One of the best things about quitting was that whenever I felt bad about myself or not confident with who I am, I could tell myself that I had managed to drop such a long-running addiction. This gave me a massive push of positive energy and self-confidence boost. It also stopped me from getting back into it, because I every time I was offered weed, the romanticism had faded and I knew that indulging entailed losing all that positive energy I had accumulated. I cannot express enough how much this helped. It helped me be more forgiving to myself and have a more positive self-image.  

Overall, I am more self-confident in general and have less episodes of low self-confidence - I used  to mumble, forget stuff easily, which made me feel shit. These positive effects started pretty early on.  I did not expect my memory to get better, but I barely ever forget stuff anymore. 

I can't say I am more hard-working now, but I got no excuse for being lazy now which certainly helps and my productivity overall has increased. 

There are so many things I want to say, but I can't the right way to express them. Either way, I want to thank everyone on this sub-reddit whose stories I used to read, whose stories kept me closer to the edge of quitting till I could actually do it. I appreciate you and I hope you have a wonderful day, night and life. You are worthy of love. We are One.",13

I'm terrified of being single so I begged him to stay, even told him I would break my sobriety for him, but he was extremely firm.

I don't know how to face life alone AND sober. But at the same time I've put in all this work and now made this huge sacrifice for the sake of making this improvement in myself, so I feel like I need to keep going.

EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for the kind comments. I‚Äôve been returning to this post a lot and reading them throughout the day to help me keep going. I‚Äôm still sober, holding my boundaries with my now-ex, and staying above water which I think is all I could ask for today.",32

I started smoking weed when I was 14, for the past 7+ years I‚Äôve been smoking essentially everyday multiple times a day. Somewhere along the way it became a part of my identity, it informed who I was in a lot of ways. All of my friends are habitual everyday smokers. I‚Äôm a very introverted person and the vast majority of my weed smoking/vaping/etc. has been by myself. In high school I used to vape weed during lunch in the locker room by myself. I never actually went to lunch or ate, I just got by and lived in my own head. One of my biggest problems is that I am very high functioning when smoking constantly. I got to a point where I was high all the time and keeping up with my school work and that was enough. I was driving high, everytime that I drove. Thankfully, I have since stopped that years ago (prolly 2-3) because I would have such bad anxiety at times while behind the wheel. I‚Äôve always been honest with my parents about my habits and though at first they put up a fight I wore them down with argument after argument defending the safety and benefits of weed. All they see is that I‚Äôm high functioning on the outside and I get my shit done. Even after all the years of smoking I still have panic attacks semi-regularly when I get high. I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression. I take hot baths and showers for at least an hour everyday, and always when I‚Äôm anxious and high. I‚Äôm constantly searching for three to four hour windows to get high. Pretty regularly I‚Äôll get weird bloated feelings in my abdomen and I‚Äôm quite sure it‚Äôs related to the weed. I ended up going to a GI specialist after years of this and they told me it was some disorder related to marijuana (endo-something canna-something). Last year I went to the doctor for a regular check-up and they asked me if I was a marathon runner. It turns out my resting heart-rate is extremely low, and I have since found out that cannabis use disorder especially in young people is linked to cardiac arythmias. None of these health problems were enough for me to consider stopping. I just have been tired for years of being dependent. I want to have motivation again and achieve something in my life. I used to think I could do that and still smoke weed but I‚Äôm not so sure anymore. Recently I moved into a new place and whenever I‚Äôm in a new place smoking I‚Äôm anxious for a good while there. This coincided with me starting back school. I‚Äôm suddenly a senior in college and I‚Äôve always wanted to go to graduate school. Just feels like the right time to get my shit together. Plus, April 1st I quit smoking cigs/vaping nicotine (which I had been addicted to for ~3 years). This has been a huge confidence boost and inspired me in large part to try with weed as well. I‚Äôm about three weeks in now and I still crave marijuana everyday. I‚Äôve come really close to using again a handful of times and I live alone so there is no one to hold me accountable. At first I told myself I‚Äôll just quit for a while, even a week sober to me felt like a miracle. This is the longest I‚Äôve been sober since I was 14, and I just have this feeling like if I smoke again I don‚Äôt know how many more years I‚Äôll lose. Please any help or support would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading if you‚Äôve made it to the end, and I wish all of you the best in your individual journeys. 
I hope this finds you well,

I want tips to get rid of that sensation of smoking and getting high.
I took the habits of write my thoughts in a book to help myself be less thoughtful at night
From my point of view now it is a waste of money, time and of my health i did all i could to occupy my free time i train i skate i go to school i study i go to work but i still have that d.nm envy

When i roll a joint now i cough more that anything else i barely smoke it all and i barely get high anymore so i dont see the point anymore but the sensation is still there what could i do?


Should I cut out of my life everyone who smoke?
Should I see a psychologist?

I saw this quote on a TV show and it really resonated with me. Helping others is actually a great way to feel good about yourself, beat the boredom and depression, and help make this world a better place. 

I‚Äôve been fostering puppies, don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs so much work and the desire for a full night‚Äôs sleep definitely brings back cravings back. But now I have a positive way to keep busy and feel good about myself too. Plus animals who open up to you and love unconditionally are great sources of natural dopamine, something our brains will have a hard time regulating right after quitting. 

Just more food for thought. Keep up the good work everyone!! Stay strong!",4

Around 2 years ago i tried weed for the first time, it was great, so joyful. A lot of new and exciting experiences, felt like most everyday activities had an overhaul, a ton of personal developing and a new perspective of life itself

Went like that for a while, long story short, my ""every weekend"" consumption slowly became 2 o 3 times a week and when i realized, i was smoking every day (april 2020). After buying 2 ounces straight i felt for the first time the need of questioning myself ¬øam i having a problem?, talked to relatives and ended up justifying what i felt. ""its just weed"" does it sound familiar?

Around 2 weeks ago, i ended my last bit of weed and couple hours after i was craving more, looking for info i found this sub and been reading it since then. I have to give you a big thank you guys because weed is so naturalized here in Uruguay and the world itself (weed is legal here), and in spanish there is'nt so much information about what weed habit can end up looking for some people, i REALLY aprecciate the perspective you gave me with every one of your posts!

Since the discovery of this sub smoking has been different, i feel a void doing it and this last week, if i had weed i literally wanted to smoke it right away to be empty again, i simply dont want to have more. I end up the last bit i had and decided THIS IS THE TIME. from what i've learn of you, i dont want to let my life go down on that spiral of cyclical vice, i just dont.

I have now a project to live with my gf in the future and build our own house, and i think weed dont have a place in that future. its just not the same anymore.

Im going to be updating this soon! sorry if i misspelled anything, english is not my main lenguage. THANKS YOU r/leaves for giving me the perspective i needed

I woke up on time and im ready to fight this!!! thanks you for reading",7

I used to smoke pot to forget or relax about my goals, to-dos, aspirations. Because these things cause some anxiety - to TRY invites failure. Easier to just smoke up, laugh, wonder at the world and view from a distance. Sometimes I would smoke before getting into work toward my goals so that the anxiety would be less. 

Now without pot, I feel like I‚Äôm using ANYTHING ELSE to avoid my responsibilities/stressors/the unknown. Sleep, mundane tasks around the house, cleaning out my email, laundry... literally anything but the main meat of what I want to get done. Cause I‚Äôm scared of failure. Scared of trying and messing up. Scared of ‚Äúdoing it wrong.‚Äù

In my case this applies specifically to a creative arts career.

Does anyone else relate to this? What are some techniques or thought changes to help me just go and get at it??

I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm in the midst of a depressive episode (I have bipolar disorder) and I‚Äôm just struggling to cope. I am kind of alternating between sad and frustrated and angry and feeling out of control and like a failure. Nothing in my life is really objectively that bad right now, I‚Äôm just getting really frustrated about relatively small things or old problems becoming obvious. This is definitely the state of mind where a couple of months ago I would‚Äôve just let up a bowl in order to shut down my brain and forget about everything that‚Äôs going on. I know, though, that that‚Äôs not really what would happen. I know that I would have an unproductive evening and feel even worse the next day. I would probably overeat and neglect to get any exercise and thus backtrack on my fitness goals. And really, I wouldn‚Äôt even actually like the way I feel while I‚Äôm high. I would still be full of anxiety and frustration, I would just be less empowered to do anything about it.

I would smoke before every meal, when waking up, and before going to bed. I knew I was dependent on weed but I still never wanted to quit because honestly I am stubborn and struggle with anxiety and eating already so I just went right along smoking per usual. 

About a month ago I drank a couple beers on an empty stomach and it triggered something in me that seriously fucked me up. The next morning I was throwing up uncontrollably to the point I couldn‚Äôt even hold down water. I still smoked to relieve my nausea and stomach cramps. After about 4 days straight of feeling like I had the stomach flu and a long Thursday night/ Friday morning that I‚Äôll never forget because I seriously felt like I was having a heart attack,  I decided to go to the emergency room because I knew I was going to fall out from dehydration at any moment. 

I went there around 2 am and I‚Äôm glad I did because it turns out I have some gallbladder attack issues but also my dr was pretty persistent when she said it was a combination of my natural gallbladder problems and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. (I honestly laughed, weed is a natural healer right? Why would it make me sicker than I‚Äôve ever felt in my life.) 

I finally decided that unless I quit smoking I was probably going to have another CHS attack and it just isn‚Äôt worth it to me so I did more research on how to slowly reduce my intake and quit. today will be my first full day without smoking weed. 

I feel really uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt have an appetite (although I am forcing myself to eat a shit ton of applesauce because it‚Äôs the only thing that makes me feel good) I‚Äôm sweating uncontrollably, I get overheated pretty easily, and I know this is just the beginning. I have been working out recently and doing yoga and I‚Äôm hoping that will help. I‚Äôm actually pretty scared because I could feel mild withdrawal even when I was just reducing my weed intake. I know I‚Äôm going to stick to it because I PROMISE you that these withdrawal symptoms will be mild compared the CHS symptoms.",2

I was with an acquaintance, who was already a pot user, and he brought some weed to smoke out of his wooden pipe. We sat down and began the ritual; I remember feeling the smoke as it entered my body. The sensation was painful, as if microscopic blades were scratching my lungs. I coughed, but the smog had already tightened and burned my chest. I only felt positive sensations for a little while. I felt tingly all over my body, but I also felt very warm. Suddenly, I began to feel as if I was no longer in full control of my actions.

My limbs seemed heavier, and my reaction time was slower. The passage of time seemed choppy; things that happened five seconds ago were quickly erased from memory. We giggled a bit when we first realized that we were feeling the effects of the drug, but I quickly began to laugh so much that I felt low on oxygen. I became unsmiling once I realized that we were laughing like hyenas, then I became asleep.

The experience felt like a trippy-dream movie scene. I went in and out of sleep in seconds, and I caught glimpses of my acquaintance' frown in-between. I heard him phoning up someone we knew. I must have been knocked-out for about thirty minutes, because the third party arrived at the scene with his skateboard. I heard them talking about me being blacked-out as I was in and out of consciousness. Once I gained some semblance of stability, they walked me home and told me to get rest. I lied in bed: assembling my sense of self. I thought that I never wanted to touch cannabis again.

I  smoked before, during and after school. We would often skate to parks, and smoke until a few hours before the sun rose. I spent almost all of my hard-earned money on weed; I stole from my parents whenever I was short on cash. I smoked out of plastic bottles, apples, pens, trumpet mouthpieces, and anything else that could sustain an ember. I tried weed, hash, edibles, and wax. Once I started smoking marijuana wax, it was over. I bought a rig + torch and began to smoke wax all day. I used to smoke before eating in the mornings, because I wanted to eat while high. I woke up to smoke, and went to sleep a red-eyed mutant.

I was seventeen when I tried weed for the first time. Fast-forward to now; I'm twenty four years of age, and I'm only two years sober. I can spend all day talking about the stress and paranoia of avoiding security guards, police, teachers, and my parents. I lied to my parents all the time. I'm sure my parents would have found out earlier if they actually cared about my whereabouts, but that's another topic.

People have said sentiments along the lines of this: ""I've been smoking for 20+ years, and I can control my usage of pot"". Well, take this from me: I can't be happy when i';m near weed, because i'll want to smoke more and more and more. I told myself that one try was more than enough, and I spent five years heavily dependent on the substance.",5

I (25M) decided to quit cold turkey after smoking virtually every day for 5 years, with the odd week or two clean here and there. 
This is probably the longest I've quit since starting.

The first week was super chilled.
 I had some trouble sleeping but felt good overall. Energy levels were good and experienced increased sharpness. Loved the dreams.

Over the next 2 weeks I got irritated, like really irritated. 
 I'm never agitated and never freak out. But in between week 1 and 3 after quitting, I probably freaked out more than the past 5 years. Stupid things tipped me and I would not know how to deal with my anger. 
This was very natural and expected it.

Then week 4 came. I started getting slightly depressed. Or everything seemed very mundane and boring to me. Little interested or excited me. Not too much to handle though, it might as well have been just a shitty week.

Week 5 is killing me though. Everyday is a Rollercoaster. Super motivated then super depressed. Loving my job to hating my job. Feeling insecure about my (new and first in a while) relationships and future to feeling confident the next day.
I have not felt this depressed in a very very long time. 


Is my week 5 experience normal?

 Starting today I've been getting really dizzy and lightheaded and it's very difficult to work. I ate some yogurt, nuts and fruit this morning and had a tea (nothing out of the ordinary).

 Luckily I am working from home so right now I am laid out on the couch with my laptop. 
Laying down is helping a little but its obviously not ideal.

I am only on day 4, I noticed some headaches the previous days but this was a lot harder to deal with. I'm not struggling very much right now with appetite or sleep.

If you had lightheadedness/dizziness/vertigo how long did it last for you? Do you have any tips on how to manage it?",1

I like this group because it's nice seeing people be honest about all the negatives of weed consumption. Which I rarely hear from anyone else.

Terrified of relapsing. The longest I've ever quit has been 5 days so I'm beating that now.

Created a brand new account because while I'm serious about quitting and know I need lots of support, I am too ashamed and guilt-ridden about my addiction to come clean to my friends and family right now and ask for their support.  I hope that I will be able to talk to them honestly about this after its in my rearview mirror. 

A list of things I am leaving in 2020:

1. the annoyed anxiety of waiting for my dealer to text me back/arrive at my place for a drop
2. the way my mouth feels in the morning: like its been shrink-wrapped in cotton + the world's worst morning breath.
3. the devastating realization that even after 5 bowls in 4 hours, I am still bored and sad; but now I am both bored/sad and unable to muster enough energy to do anything productive or even hold a conversation with someone
   1. (point 3a) devastation when you're high just feels like apathy and hollowness. Excited to leave both of these behind this year as well.
4. leaving my best friend on read for literal days. 
5. ghosting my therapist because I was high and forgot our appointment. For the second time. I'm sure it needs no explanation, but not replying to your therapists' phone call for days in a row is very, very, bad and very irresponsible. 
6. the 25+ fucking pounds I've gained since March/quarantine because my high brain enjoys one activity and only one: eating delivery food. My high brain also tells me that I can't possibly be satisfied with only one choice - in a world of so many amazing flavors, why relegate myself to just one?? So I typically get 2-3 meals/portions and tell myself they are for leftovers. Obviously I eat them all in the same sitting because I have no idea what a full stomach actually feels like when I'm high. 
7. abandoning my cousin in her times of need: our grandmother is in the process of dying, and it's very hard on our entire family. My cousin is one of my best friends, and we are both very close with our grandmother. I screen her calls/texts because I can't be high and deal with death at the same time. 
8. swelling in my joints - well whoda thunk that inhaling smoke for days on end while not moving at at all would make your whole body hurt?
9. resin-flavored, earth-shattering, phlegm-covered coughs. 
10. low self-confidence - me without pot is a **real** fucking catch. I remember this truth from years ago, and from the few times in the past 5ish years that I've taken T-breaks. As a single person who is ready to not be single anymore, my relationship with pot has made me dull and uninteresting. I'm ready to break up with marijuana and like, idk, have a relationship with a human man instead. 

This sub has been the inspiration for me to finally kick the habit, and I feel comfortable and validated by everyone here. Thank you for being a fire in my belly and a safety net for this leap I'm taking.",90

When I was smoking heavily for my first year (I was 17) my eyes were constantly red since I was constantly high all year. Fast forward to 2 years of more daily smoking(I used a dab pen or wax) my eyes never changed to red anymore they stayed white or had a tinge of yellow. As of now (I'm 21) I'm approaching 4 months sober but the problem is that other than paws which I have to deal with my eyes are consistently a shade of red not high out of my mind red but you can see plenty of red veins in the whites of my eyes theres definitely an overall red tinge to it. Before I smoked I remember my eyes always being super white never any red veins. I thought quitting would give me clear eyes again but if anything they get even redder on some days. I just want to be like my old self again with 0 brain fog and clear eyes. I'm getting 8 hours or more of sleep per day and I'm eating extreemly clean food. Does anyone have any idea as to what this could be or how to fix it? Thanks for reading.,1

The novelty of quitting has faded, I'm settled in my new house, the new hobby (knitting) I've picked up is slow and I'm bad at it, the 18 credit hours of online college I'm taking is starting to take its toll, I miss my old job (transferred to a new location and I miss the old environment)- and all I want to do is blaze up. I could float away, just for a little bit.

The benefits of quitting are obvious to me- the brain hitching has faded away, my feelings are clearer, my words are more eloquent, my memory is better- but I'm taking it all for granted and I just. want. to. smoke!!

I recognize why I want to smoke- I'm stressed, feel guilt about not completing all of the readings for class, my relationship is on the rocks, I don't have any friends...... but knowing *why* doesn't get rid of the *want*. If anything, it amplifies my cravings. Uhhh, of course I want to smoke, my feet are planted squarely on the ground. I haven't been in the clouds for over a month.

It doesn't help that one of my roommates is a heavvvy smoker, and she's gr\*wing. All day, everyday, it's wafting out of her room. The smoke is soo fragrant, and the pl\*nt is beautiful. Even though she knows I've quit, she still offers for me to smoke with her from time to time, which is kind of shitty honestly. It takes everything in me to turn her down, but I know it will just give me a panic attack. No use in starting from ground zero again. 

But still, I tell myself.. spark up and fly away, for just one more day.

Good morning guys! I just wanted to check in and let everyone know how I'm doing today. So far today has been a good morning. I was a bit lethargic when I woke up and I sat in the shower for a bit, but otherwise I feel great. 

My anxiety is WAY down from where it was a week ago when I was smoking daily. This is absolutely an amazing feeling, because I have been plagued with crippling anxiety and intrusive thoughts since I was a teenager. These got better when I first started smoking, but soon the pot was fueling the fire without me even realizing.

I know that there may be huge swings in emotions coming as I progress through this journey, but all I can say really is wow. Is this what normal people feel like all the time without worrying sick about possible scenarios?

 I'm laughing a lot more and really enjoying music, eating is almost back to normal. Brain fog is definitely there but matcha tea has been helping that while I work.
I also had an amazing series of dreams last night that were super vivid and it felt so good.

Cravings are still coming in for sure, but they seem to be lessening each day. I've been very mindful about the cravings and actively challenge them. 
Anytime they are really strong I will just go exercise or distract myself.

Cheers to everyone so far for all of the motivation! 
I am nowhere near out of the jungle yet, but this huge beam of light I'm experiencing really encourages me.

Sending love and positivity to everyone today!",8

If you focus on not doing weed but you really still want to then you are still focused on weed and it'll be difficult to sustain. Instead seek out a new life, a new lifestyle. Most people do not smoke weed. We don't need it, we've just convinced ourselves that we do. Our brains and its thoughts are powerful and have the ability to keep us hooked or free us. We just need to figure out how to tap into that. It's a simple concept and one that is not easy to implement. We're all born with all the tools we need to cope. They get rusty over time while we're using weed and not using them. Once we stop, with intent to do better they start to function again. We also develop new tools along the way. Relapsing is not a joke or something to be experimented with. If you had been addicted a relapse is playing with fire and once that boundary is broken down its real easy to fall back into your old patterns.",456

I can see it happening but it is scary because I think it came on when I started smoking weed. 

I used to be a meth addict and got clean off that 3 years ago. I used the weed to manage the ego activation craving. I understand that I could have damaged myself with all the other drug use a well.

The horrifying effects overtook him for 4 to 4.5 weeks and currently at week 6 he is still not himself. The effects in the first 4 weeks were debilitating. His tongue and mouth went numb, he described the feeling of intense waves of cold, then hot, then pressure traveling from his face out over his body. He saw a bright flash and heard a boom. In the days following the event He had to teach himself how to use his hands again, how to write properly, balance, and other things. He knew people but said we looked unfamiliar. 

He described an emotional cycle of sadness, fear, the feeling of being lost and alone, paranoia, sudden onset tiredness, then placid, then it would repeat this cycle of emotions. He said it‚Äôs worse than death. The cycle occurred every 3-5 minutes. He said it felt like everything important, his achievements, goals, intelligence and everything he learned was stolen from him. 

There are still lingering effects such as slow eye movement, sickness, speech issues, trouble with reasoning complex issues or thinking deeply. He‚Äôs really sensitive to light and sudden tiredness/head pain hits him like bricks. He tries to sleep a lot now because he has no energy or interest in anything - it‚Äôs all boring and confusing, making him dizzy - but sleep bring awful sense of being lost and ‚Äúcinnamon hearts‚Äù burning sensation in his head.

You can have a guy, who is sober 1 month, but he goes out of his comfort zone pretty often and therefore he will see much greater results than guy who is sober for 6 months, but he still does the same things as if he was toking or he just found new, slightly less harmful waste of time like playing games or watching netflix all day long. 


Now, everyone is different and you gotta take into account also how early in life you began smoking, how much and for how long and how weed affects you as an individual. 

It is quite possible that you will have to wait some time before you will be able to really snap out of it and actively trying new things without feeling overwhelmed, but on the other hand, you shouldn't wait too long, otherwise you will relapse. And the cycle repeats. 

Now, it is easy to say this and hard to really implement this, but knowledge and self awareness is powerful and first step to complete recovery, which could take months, years.... it varies from person to person I believe. 

I had 2 long streaks, one was around 90 days and second around 40 days and I was doomed to relapse because of those reasons I just wrote above.

If any of you aren't aware, it is a buildup of cannabanoids in your intestines and it causes nausea. For most people taking a break and a shower can help. I puked so much and so hard that stomach lining was coming up. I was curled in the fetal position in the bathtub after hours of back and forth between there, the toilet, and bed. An ambulance had to take me to the hospital where I took three bags of fluid, was told that my lactic acid levels were 7x normal, and I was told that I developed pancreatitis after a CT scan was done to rule out other things. The doctors told me that I went in at the last second because my body would have started to shut down if I kept it up for much longer. The recovery took a week with some sketchy spots in the middle because of trying to recover too quickly.

I never EVER want to go through that again. It was a living hell, and I am thankful that I don't remember all of it.

That being said, anhedonia is kicking my ass, so much so that I am constantly having to tell myself 'no' to internal urges to smoke a little, just to take the edge off. I haven't, and I won't, but I am finding out that 19+ years of daily smoking did a number on my brain chemistry and it is getting bad. I don't want to do shit except mope. Games, drawing, family, all are just grey and bland. I already take meds for anxiety/OCD (funnily enough, weed didnt make that worse) and am nervous to put an antidepressant in the mix.

When I quit last time I would go on a long walk or go workout (this helped a ton) when the thoughts crept in..but now those options aren't available. I guess I could scooter around on my new amazon buy but it's just not the same for my head and getting that anxious feeling to go away. Any help is super appreciated and if you're reading this I hope you're kicking that habits ass and having a great day.",2

She suggested on the first visit I should stop smoking to try and get my vigor back for life or at least get some motivation. I haven‚Äôt smoked since Friday. I‚Äôve noticed the main reason I smoke is to keep my anxieties at bay and the incessant negative thoughts that always creep into my mind. I‚Äôm 28. Unemployed. Have a knee injury that causes a lot of pain because I‚Äôm 320 lbs. My mom died in March and I told myself once she passed I‚Äôd get my life together. Luckily I was able to be there with her every day while she was sick. When she died the world shut down due to covid. Now, at this stage in my life, I‚Äôm the most lost I‚Äôve ever been. I don‚Äôt have any hope left for the future, not only for myself but for this shitty country. I don‚Äôt want to do anything. Nothing brings me joy. Nothing intrigues me. Nothing seems to have that spark. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I hate my life and I hate the state of the world. I‚Äôm a burden on the family I have left. I‚Äôm 28 taking money from my 68 year old father in order to eat and I have so much god damn shame for doing so. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. 

I thought not smoking would help, but all that‚Äôs happened is I can‚Äôt turn my brain off. I think about all the things I don‚Äôt want to think about and it‚Äôs getting really fucking old. I can‚Äôt get high even if I wanted to, and at this point I‚Äôm going to stick with it and not. I can‚Äôt buy drugs with my dads money, absolutely fucking not. The suicidal ideations were gone when I started therapy, now they‚Äôre back because I literally do nothing all day and I don‚Äôt have marijuana to turn my brain off. I fucking hate it here, and I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore.",8

It was helpful as a way to deal with chronic pain and panic attacks that I've had all my life and while I did use it for that ultimately I ended up smoking much more to run from the weight of my emotions. 

I've had a pretty hectic life, especially these past few years and at 22 I'm finally getting around to dealing with my shit and choosing to be better for my future self. I'm looking forward to not having this brain fog so often and finding other ways to manage my anxiety and express myself.",5

I have anxiety and sometimes depression creeps in. Thats the reason why I started smoking. I mention this because im worried about my mental health, this year has been a mess and for many of you I know you can agree. I've been stressed out due to all the politics and news surrounding the state of the country as of right now as the elections are creeping in, along with all the societal issues that have been developing. My new college semester started and I've been working along with being locked in due to quarentine I never felt like I got any proper rest during this summer to just ""disconnect"". 

I've been feeling, since quitting, some weird symptoms and I want to know what they could be or maybe its just my anxiety creeping. The symptoms are, some weird form of nausea. The best way I can describe it is when you get too greened out and you feel as if the room starts spinning. I feel the same way as I did high except the negative effects, the disorientation. And disruptive thoughts, I think a lot and sometimes my thoughts cause me to over think and throw me into a panic attack which is why I started smoking but now I've been getting these thoughts and the disorientation and it makes me worried.

Probably 12-15 rips off pen on an average day, starting right before I work out first thing in the AM and ending right before I go to bed. Was able to work and be productive, exercise regularly and live an otherwise normal life.

Trying to have a baby with wife and I feel like my thc use has prevented that from happening up to this point (been to doc, she agrees), so I'm done.

I'm on day 14, doing ok. Definitely clearer minded, less groggy, more pep in my step. But now everything seems boring. I am so used to getting high before doing anything because it always made tasks or activities more interesting. 

Does this feeling fade? Will I always feel like something will be more enjoyable if I was high? 

My first experience with thc was amazing, and I was instantly hooked. I never felt like it was an issue because I was still successful professionally, socially, financially, etc. I almost considered it a part of me and something I was going to just do forever. I read stories here of folks who claim their life changed for the better in many ways after they quit, but what if my life is already pretty damn good? Can anyone relate?

One positive I can see is better workouts, and being physically healthy is very important to me. So I've got that going for me.

What better time than now?

&#x200B;

I doubt Rage against the machine meant those lyrics in this context, but they really hit me on my way home today. I planned on quiting around now for a while. I'm 30 years old and I've been smoking daily for over 10 years. I have postponed quiting to certain dates a few times. Start of first job, moving in with my girlfriend, start of second job, ... I never followed trough when the date arrived.

&#x200B;

I've told myself for two years that I would quit when we got married and that is this weekend. This time it has to end.

&#x200B;

I don't want anymore awkward social interactions. I don't want to think ""Do they know I'm high?"" the whole time.  I'm hoping this returns quickly since I don't have social issues when sober. 

&#x200B;

I want to regain my memory. Most of the days, I can't even remember what I ate yesterday. I was a pretty smart guy that just had to read a book once and ace an exam. Will that ever come back the way it was?

&#x200B;

I want my stomach and intestines to recuperate. I have a lot of problems with acid reflux since a few years. I can't lie down for hours after eating. If I do, acid reflux gets into my esophagus and this could really cause damage in the long term. Off course, having the munchies does not help. When I went to see a doctor about this problem, he asked me if I smoked weed (not cigarettes or anything else, specifically weed). I said ""only occasionally"", because I never saw myself as a big stoner since I could get by on 1g a week at the time (currently it's more like 2g). He said that that wasn't the problem then since this problem only existed for heavy smokers. He moved on and diagnosed me with something else. Will I be able to lie down again after eating? I'm not sure I ever really will be able to anymore. But from my experience comparing heavy to low smoking dyas, I expect the time it takes before I can lie down will decrease. 

&#x200B;

I want it out of my system before we start trying to have kids next year. I don't want it influencing my sperm or my capabilities as a dad. I hope I'm still in time if I quit now... 

&#x200B;

I want to be succesful in my job. I know I can be, but I'm so lazy. In the morning my head is still brain fog and in the afternoon I will likely have smoked.

&#x200B;

Day 1. The cravings are insane. I always smoked joints mixed with tobacco. So I tried smoking a cigarette, but I only feel worse now. How do you handle the cravings?

- a clear head and space in the mind, real space
- being calmer in situations and less anxiety
- no more terrible thought loops
- sleeping better and rested well in the morning 
- more money in the bank or into important things
- more time to spend with family and friends 
- more focus and positivity onto future life
- more steady, more clearity, more energy.

2020-09-09 10:48:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iph9jn/a_30_year_habit_fades_away/,A 30 Year Habit Fades Away,"Reflecting back today on my long-term love affair with this lovely plant spirit, about 3 months after I quit cannabis.  Cannabis was the last drug  I was hooked on.  It was hard to find motivation to quit since I didn't see many negative effects on my life.  Financially it was positive -- I was a grower for years.  Emotionally it seemed neutral or positive -- I was always a happy guy with a little dose. Sexually it was fabulous.  Withdrawals weren't an issue -- every year I would take some time off during family vacations, without trouble.

So overall cannabis didn't seem to be a net negative in my life, especially compared to alcohol.  Alcohol was the main damaging influence on me, I was a daily drinker for 25 years before finally quitting 8 years ago.

So why quit?

A few years ago I found a meditation and yoga school that brought me the most pure intense bliss and joy I'd ever known in my life.  It was what I'd always wanted, what we hope to find through drugs or other forms of escapism.  Just joy, happiness, total abandon and lack of worry.  Right On, cool, I finally found the fountain of youth and I can stop worrying about my life.

But I kept on toking, every day, morning, noon, and night.  Why not?  Unlimited supply, it makes me happy, I can still do all the meditation and yoga.  It even seemed to work better while stoned.  And there were lots of people who reached the same conclusion.  I've always loved the work of the author Robert Anton Wilson, and he maintained that cannabis was an amazing shortcut to raising a person's consciousness level.  Exactly what the yoga and meditation were doing.  And it felt like it, cannnabis pushed my mind, emotion, and thoughts in the same direction as that pure bliss of well-done meditation.

So I kept on like that for a few years, until this summer.  One day I woke up at 5AM, my normal time for morning yoga and meditation.  I didn't toke up first though, just thought ""Oh, today it will be sober yoga, unassisted.""  Lunchtime and evening tokes faded away the same way, ""Oh, I guess not today..."".

A few days pass like this, then a few weeks, then a month before I realize what's happening.  A month without any cannabis?  Any drug at all?  And nobody ordered me to quit?  I'm about 50 and that hadn't ever happened in my 35 year drug career.

So now it's settling in that I'm a non-toker.  Oh, I might take a hit or two every month or so.  Just like I might have one cup of coffee on a long drive. But neither drug will pull me into regular or daily use.

So what's on the other side of this divide, what's a drug-free life really like?  I don't know man, hard to day, it's different for everybody of course.  For me I had to get my life sorted out completely first.  A great wife, a girlfriend that the wife likes, enough money, children grown and successful, stable career, and a daily dose of bliss from meditation.  EZ mode.

What do I need drugs for?

So now I find an increased sensitivity to life.  The little things are more beautiful, more intense, more emotional.  I think that's probably the biggest change for me from going cannabis-free.

Best wishes to all you crazy cats working through giving up cannabis.  I'm here with you.  We're all here together.  It helps to let your true self retake control here, so remember:

* You are not the body
* You are not even the mind

Namaste,

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm psychic, and I don‚Äôt think they tell the future or anything...instead I use them to basically receive the messages I need to but don‚Äôt want to hear. I use them to help me stay in alignment with my highest potential, and to stay connected to my HP.

Im six weeks and some change sober. I‚Äôve been having a hard time and really wanting to go back to smoking, my brain is lying to me lots that nothing has changed and that it‚Äôll be fine and I deserve a treat, the usual stuff. I decided to ask my cards how my highest potential will be affected if I go back to smoking and how it‚Äôll be affected if I continued on with sobriety. The answer was frickin‚Äô clear as day. I‚Äôm paring this down to just a few key words...
Going back to smoking - procrastination, unfulfilled dreams, lacking in self-confidence.
Continuing with sobriety - abundance, generosity, living up to your full potential.

Yeesh. Well after being told a clear and resounding ‚Äúno‚Äù by my cards, my addict brain kicked into an even higher gear.

I have been feeling particularly cravey and my husband just bought a vape cart after not having any in the house for a week or so. I‚Äôve been picking it up and letting myself fantasize a little.

I decided to ask my cards to tell me the gifts I‚Äôll receive if I continue with sobriety to give myself some motivation. First card was abundance and public recognition, fulfilled dreams and clarity in what you want moving forward. Second card said prevailing through really difficult challenges to reach a big achievement, having support of those around you, major self-confidence. Well damn. 

A third card popped out of the deck as I was shuffling the others back in. It said you‚Äôre trying to get away with something and maybe you will but you won‚Äôt feel good about it and it‚Äôll set you back so don‚Äôt do it. I definitely took that as a chastisement for fantasizing with the pen.

Today I remembered that I took a picture of myself stoned a few days before I quit, took one of myself this morning and looked at them side by side, a lot has changed. Motivation returned full force, I‚Äôm not going back.

Today I am feeling a lot more emotionally stable. I haven't cried once this morning or had a breakdown which is a huge change from the last couple of days. It is still the morning so nothing is off the table yet, but this morning has been a good start.

I think what made a huge difference for me was proving to myself that I can work and be productive during this journey. I was so scared that I would be totally non functional and be fired. I know some days are going to be tough and some days may not be very productive, but it feels like a weight has lifted off my shoulders.


 One thing that is coming on HARD is the cravings! Not only is it craving the high, but I crave the mouth feel, smell, taste, etc.

What am I doing about them? 
Well, I read some posts on here that gave me some great advice on how to handle them. I started doing Yoga yesterday and wow did it work. Not only did I feel my cravings lessen, but I just felt GOOD. I've been walking my dog also and chasing her around and throwing sticks which is helping as well.

My appetite is a bit wonky but back to about 70%, and food tastes great. 

Also, I slept 9 hours last night!! I had a little help but I won't mention what.

Sending positive vibes to everyone here today and thank you to everyone so far for all of the support.

This was just out of boredom, the pandemic and unemployment. With all that in mind, I finally decided, why not? Just chill out.

Initially, I just wanted a few joints but that turned into spending lots of money on weed, food, impulse purchases and decisions. I do feel bad for the money and the time I have wasted but I have also had fun. I will deal with the consequences later.

Weed makes me confident, it makes me take risks and almost not give a flip about anything. It makes me want to enjoy and live life regardless of how I am feeling. I just do. Within the past 3 months, I have stepped out of my comfort zone many times and done things I would have taken ages to do if I were sober.

I also realised that I do have these traits weed gives me but somehow over the years, life has tested me, tossed me around and somehow cloaked these qualities with self-doubt and laziness. Weed somehow lifts this cloak and life becomes great again. Unfortunately with everything in life, there must be a good and a bad side to it. Weed brings the good but after continuous usage, the bad slowly creeps up on you. The bad is not worth smoking to experience the good side.

I have a few job interviews coming up so I've decided to give it up again. I love weed and I've experienced a lot of positives being on it but on the flip side, it brings out a lot of negatives which affects or hinders the idea of my future self, the person I'd like to become.

I'm done wallowing in pity and feeling sorry for myself. I have embraced that I have an addicts brain and the only way to accept it and find ways to develop ""healthy addictions"" and not give in to the bad ones, because that will lead me nowhere.

I've had fun with weed, smoked enough to get higher than the heavens above but unfortunately, it just doesn't fit the idea of my future self. I have tried to incorporate it in many ways but it just doesn't fit.

We smile through the troubles we face, we embrace our inner strength and we keep fighting to be our better selves tomorrow.

Much Love!",5

2020-09-09 01:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ipae3g/thoughts_on_200_days_free/,Thoughts on 200 days free,"Wednesday will mark 200 days free for me. I wanted to share some thoughts about it.

People tend to focus on a few things when quitting:
1. Withdrawals
2. When will (this or that) be back to normal
3. Improvements in life in general

People are so eager to see results from quitting and talk about how they feel in the first week, or two weeks, or month.

There definitely are benefits in that time. I have always felt that smoking weed daily is like driving through life with the parking brake on. As soon as you stop smoking, life surges forward. Suddenly you have all this energy. You get productive. You feel mentally clear. Sure sleep and appetite can be a problem, but it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of being sober.

Weeks later, the novelty wears off, the cravings come and go, emotions become a roller coaster. I had bad intermittent road rage in the first 2 months of quitting. I got in a few arguments. It would have been very easy to go back to smoking in that time. The 2-3 month mark is critical. I was depressed and weekends felt empty. I resorted to drinking on Sunday afternoons, but fortunately I don't really like alcohol so I never made a habit of it and only did it on a few weekends before realizing it wasn't the way to go.

At about the 4.5 month mark I noticed something remarkable. I was having fun. Doing normal stuff. Hiking, playing bass, drawing, watching youtube, playing games. It was all fun again. I didn't feel like the weekends were wasted if I was sober.

I have heard it takes 6 months to adjust to a new lifestyle, for your expectations and emotions to stabilize. Whether that is going to prison or winning the lottery, you eventually get used to it. 

I just want to say to anyone out there who is looking for fast results to be patient and know that it takes time for your brain's reward system to reset. Normal things will become fun again if you stop spiking your dopamine artificially, but it takes time.

One last thing... an analogy for addiction. I think of smoking weed the first time as putting eggs in my brain. The eggs hatch and out come these baby birds looking for food. They scream to be fed, so you smoke again to feed them. They grow. They need more food next time. It continues. Soon they grow up and make more nests in your brain. Their babies hatch and grow. They need to be fed. You keep smoking to feed them. What happens when you quit? They starve. They scream louder at first, and it hurts to ignore them. But if you ignore them long enough, eventually they die. You don't think about them anymore. But you cannot forget that they always leave some eggs behind. It is ok though, the eggs are harmless. Just don't smoke again, or they will hatch, and you will be dealing with the same problems as before. Thinking of this has reminded me why I cannot go back, not even once, for fear of cracking open those eggs.",30

Honestly, I have zero cravings anymore. I even thought I smelt it in passing when I was out last night and the smell was nice, but I didn't have the urge to smoke at all. From a financial perspective, I'm so freaking glad I quit. I make $500 a month if i'm lucky with a part time job that I have. I just finished schooling and am now looking for a full time job as well. Just blows because COVID 19 is delaying the whole process of my degree being finalized and official transcripts aren't getting delivered anytime soon.

There is better ""strategy"" than this. 

Say to yourself, ""okay, I feel stuck for the past x years, my self development progress is slim to none and I have a feeling that weed plays a big role in this. So I will quit for 2 years and see what happens. If I will progress more in those 2 years than through my whole smoking career, It would be probably good to keep sobriety and see how far I can go"" 

Chances are, after those 2 years, you will not even want to smoke anymore and if you do, chances are you won't like it at all (search for some stories on this subreddit, find posts from people who have 2+ years and tried it again, most of them will tell you they realised that they don't like it anymore and have no problems with keeping sobriety) 

Now, I am just sharing my thoughts and strategy. I am by no means sober for a long time, but I think if we all really implement this mindset, wonderful things could happen and it will be much easier to go through it. 

at the end of the day, it will be hard but worth it. You will come out stronger than ever if you will push through it, that's for sure. And who knows how far you will come in life. But I can tell you this, you will grow at a speed of light compared to your old, stoned self.

It seems like every day something else is going wrong or like last night, I had people throwing eggs and bricks at my truck because they did not like where I was parked (I HAD to park in the spot for my job)..
I am afraid that if things keep going the way they are right now, I may absolutely lose it and being a truck driver on the 401, that's a scary thought.

Some kind words, advice, breathing techniques, anything would be appreciated at this point. I might even just park the truck and go home and tell my boss to go F himself if he doesn't like it.

Y'all.. PLEASE help me calm down! üòÇ

Edit: I appreciate your comments and they will not go un-read. Being that I'm on the road constantly it is certainly hard to reply to you in time, but any time I stop or get the chance I will try my best to reply back.
Thanks guys/gals üíï",3

I‚Äôve gotten really good at getting ready for bed so when I get in bed, I can sleep (or if not sleep, at least rest enough not spin out into a sobbing panic attack.)

I‚Äôm working really hard on stress management: lots of yoga, meditation, calming music and using lavender like chloroform.

All good, right? 

I‚Äôm so bored. So bone-achingly bored that I might cry. I have things to do, places I could go, people I could visit but I want to do nothing.

Hours and hours of nothing but staring at a screen, slack-jawed and incapable of sustained attention.

6 days ago, I smoked a little tiny one hitter and got absolutely gobsmacked, as I hadn‚Äôt smoked since about 2 months BEFORE that, because smoking just made it hard to breathe, gave me anxiety, depression, and made me super uncomfortable and somewhat suicidal. 

I just discovered this sub the other day and didn‚Äôt realize other people also just didn‚Äôt like smoking weed anymore. 

That‚Äôs crazy to me. The fact that I‚Äôm even saying I‚Äôm done with weed. Less than a year ago I‚Äôd given my friend so much shit for quitting. And now I‚Äôm in the same boat. I get it now. 

I‚Äôm really happy there‚Äôs a whole community for this exact thing. It‚Äôs insane watching how controlling THC actually is for so many people. And how it isn‚Äôt addressed. 

I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but I think I‚Äôm done forever. 

Sure, weed was fun for a while. But I was the person who gets a gram, smokes it in a day, and panics because I need more and more. For months on end before I just stopped for a few weeks. Then back at it again. 

It started making me over analyze myself. Everybody around me. Every word they said had a completely different meaning. Almost like they all secretly hated me. 

I felt so uncomfortable. I couldn‚Äôt sit still. I had to constantly readjust to make sure I didn‚Äôt look too fat, or too unnatural, or too nervous, etc. 

I never once had a dream while going to sleep high. 

But the thing that did it for me. Was my new girlfriend had come up to see me. She brought about an eighth. We sat in her car and I packed ONE bowl. She took a tiny hit and her throat started getting blisters in it and swelling, and she could taste blood. 
(She was fine like 10 minutes later, just needed to drink some water and have a breath) 

I was so high all I did was sit there. I couldn‚Äôt help. I felt so guilty afterwards. I just couldn‚Äôt smoke anymore after that.

I am typing this one... a few hour back i felt very strange, i felt something is there on my chest.

And share joint. This make me nervous because i was using pot regularly for past 3 days and whenever i smoke i feel something racing badly in my chest.! Maybe atrial fibrillation or idk. Few hour back i was sweating badly, felt like i had few minutes more left! I was struggling a bit.. maybe panic or anxiety attack but it wasn‚Äôt normal, it was linked to the weed effect. When i searched the relation of smoking pot and heart problem. I was kind of right!
I don‚Äôt know the damage has been done or not by this weed, but one thing I‚Äôm so sure from the moment i get relieved by those condition. 
I will not gamble my life with these drugs anymore. 
I am quitting smoking weed and alcohol too from now....
I already quit smoking cigarettes from past 7 months. 
And i think time is right for me to quit this weed and alcohol too from my life.
I know this is hard but I believe i can do it. I already achieved one thing in this.

I've always acknowledged the downsides to weed, but now I'm having a hard time actually addressing them. My attention span feels way worse than years before, my appetite is janky, my sleep habits are off and I don't follow through on half the things I want to because being stoned fills me with this ""Eh, I'll do it later/I don't feel like it"" attitude that just sucks.

My life isn't in shambles, but it has this dullness to it that I know is starting to affect other parts of my life and I'm having a hard time sticking to quitting. I plan on giving away the rest of my weed when I get home and looking for other ways to relax instead of getting blazed.

Recently I traveled to another state to stay with my husband‚Äôs grandparents while his aunt and uncle, who they live with, were away. We both decided not to bring weed because if anything were to happen, we wanted to be in the right state of mind. It was only a week but I found myself sleeping better, feeling even more clear headed, accessing a vocabulary I didn‚Äôt know I had, and - surprise - not binging on snacks after dinner. Now I‚Äôm pretty sold on giving life a try without weed. I never thought I‚Äôd feel this way. Weed felt like a much safer option next to alcohol. But I was kidding myself. I relied on it during the first months of my alcohol sobriety, and in many ways I wish I hadn‚Äôt. But here I am - I‚Äôm learning! I want to be free of any of these dependencies and be the best version of myself that I can be. No one seems to understand - except all of your, dear redditers.

I've smoked weed since I was 15, and I estimate that I've probably smoked 15,000 times in my life. I'm trying not to write a novel here, so suffice to say that I've wasted a massive amount of time so far in my life, with less to show for it than one may expect for someone my age. I decided to go back to school and pursue an engineering degree a few years ago, and I've been doing a pretty good job of that - I had a decent internship this summer and I feel like I'll be able to create a decent career for myself when I graduate. Academically and professionally, I'm doing okay (I also had a couple decent jobs between my first failed attempt at school and the second where I grew a lot), but I feel a lot less well-rounded and interesting than someone my age should probably be, and I guess a lot of that is because I smoked pot instead of ever doing anything extra to grow and improve. Where are the interests and passions I should have by now?

This summer at my internship, one of my co-workers was a guy in his mid-50s, with whom I noticed a mild theme of underemployment throughout his career history considering his aptitude (although there was a solid longer-term position worked in there with the noise), and this was most obvious in his current position, whose daily work output (and hourly) was within spitting distance of mine, the intern's. I know everyone's story is full of unique factors, and in his case there were some reasonable explanations... but when I found out he was a closet daily stoner for the past 35 years, it was hard not to wonder how much of a factor that may have been. I'd mentioned offhandedly to him once that I had struggled with explosive anger throughout my life, and was once again in search of a good coping mechanism now that I couldn't resort to marijuana, and he shakes his head and says ""no, when I find myself being overly bothered by something angering, I just have a joint and don't really care anymore"", and I didn't know how to respond to that. I feel like in another 25 years I could easily have a very similar history with marijuana, and considering how it shaped the past ten years of my life, I have no doubt that it would continue to shape my career and personal growth in its own way. For both of us, it wasn't (or wouldn't have been) even close to a life-ruining dependency, just a mild retarding force.

Honestly, I would love to reach a point in my life where I decide that it's okay for me to plateau - after I become a PE, with a secure state job, going home to my fully-owned house - and return to my security blanket, the one that patches so many of the flaws in my personality as well as fills in the more interesting parts, where I go home after work and hit my bong and check out for the rest of the day, except I don't feel guilty anymore because I've already ""made it"". This has been in the front of my mind during every quit attempt and I'm not even sorry to say that it's a goal in this one too. I feel like the difference now is that I better accept that this time is a ways off, and I need to tackle what's in front of me now and for the foreseeable future without my foggy crutch. I wrote this whole post about how weed is bad and it makes me boring and others complacent, and yet here I am finishing it by packing a bowl for my future self. More than ever before, though, I accept that this bowl truly is packed for my FUTURE self, and that quitting for a few months before fooling myself into thinking that I can just smoke on the weekends isn't good enough anymore. Like most of you, I have no real ability to moderate my cannabis usage, although I was able to keep myself from going to work or school high, which I suppose is something. If I begin again, there can't be any subtext of aspirations to moderate my usage, and there can't be some greater goal that I'm putting off by partaking. For now, and for what I imagine and hope is the greater part of a decade, I need to focus on personal and professional growth, and I get that better than ever before.",8

Today is Day 2 of being sober for me and I still feel like I'm in a fog. But, it has been almost surreal to notice myself today and yesterday, to spend time with myself without the middleman of getting high as an interpreter for my feelings and emotions. I am writing this down because I want to commit to myself as sober and I know that the only thing standing in the way of that is myself. 

The main thing I have noticed today is the feeling of numbness I've been cultivating for so long has shifted to accommodate the anxiety and paranoia that I was pushing away. So to be sitting here now and feel the remnants of that numbness mixed with my 'real' feelings is very powerful and makes me realise how much of myself I had put on hold in order to continue smoking. 

This is not the first time I've tried to stop smoking but it is the first time I've really been frank with myself about how this version of me is sacrificing their relationships, opportunities and life. I'm excited to get some control back, to be less separated in myself and how I navigate the world.

Felt a lot more switched on for the day, just had a clearer mind set throughout the day which I liked, but when I come home today I have this insane urge to smoke some weed, I rolled a j and smoked half of it, I feel a little ashamed but can assure myself this will not happen tomorrow. I have quit before but that was a long time ago and I finally now realise how many years and chances I‚Äôve wasted with this. So I ask the community and great people of the thread to share some knowledge of ways that may have helped them in their journey to a sober and happy life ! Thanks in advance guys :)",5

I am a 21 year old male who has decided to quit smoking weed (4th of September) following weed induced anxiety. Let me give you some back story first.

  


During my years at sixth form (aged 16-18) I seldom smoked. Maybe once or twice the entire time I was there. The problem for me was when I moved away from home to university, being in a house of people who smoked regularly. And much like them, I followed suit, smoking almost daily.

  


Then second year came around, and I was going on study abroad to British Columbia, the same year that weed was made legal. This is the year that I believe I became fully addicted, smoking up to 14gs between me and my girlfriend at the time DAILY (backwoods are devilish).

  


Going into third year coming back to the UK is when I saw the full extent of my addiction, as I came back to the same group of people, but I ended up smoking alone a lot, as they didn‚Äôt smoke as much as me anymore. This persisted up until lockdown, where my usual hobby of bouldering got cancelled due to covid, and was promptly replaced with smoking weed constantly.

  


I smoked all throughout lock down thinking that this was the best way to spend my time, however I started to get symptoms of anxiety and flu everytime I smoked.

  


Today is the fourth day of not smoking, and I still get anxious and chest tightness to the extent where I‚Äôm bed ridden and feel like I cannot leave. I‚Äôm praying that its not covid as the symptoms of withdrawal are uncannily similar to that of covid. I am certain that I will not relapse, as I am sick of this old life that I lead, living to smoke, rather than living to live. Going into my 4th year of university as a post graduate , I cannot be leading this child-like life anymore, as I finally need to act like an adult.

  


To conclude, I‚Äôm taking everyday as it is, trying to occupy my time as well as I can (skateboarding, baking bread, etc). The anxiety and chest tightness is like nothing I have felt before, but it is bare able.

  


I would like to thank this subreddit for what you have done for me so far, and I hope that I will eventually be able to post reports of weeks, months or even years sober. 

  


Thank you again.

After Day 4 and trying all the wonderful tips this group has had made such a difference! I can finally eat and want to eat, my anxiety has massively subsided and I am feeling like I have better control over my emotions.

I am finding despite eating and drinking throughout the day that when I wake up in the morning I feel quite shaky and my stomach isnt 100%. This has made it difficult to get in more exercise and I find myself sleeping in much later. Any thoughts on what may be causing this.

Really love the positivity in this group and all the help thus far. I noticed on a previous post that there are comments that I can't see. I got a notification to my phone but when I go the post they aren't there but in the comment count. I'm knew to Reddit  so don't know if that's supposed to happen.

Throughout the entirety of UK lockdown I have been living opposite my weed guy. I gave myself a pass at the start of lockdown, there was no way I could quit while living here. Trying would be futile. 

But today I'm moving house. Away from this guy, towards a fresh start. I'm ready to end this addiction! I am tired of living a half life, tired of being under the control of this substance. 

I said goodbye to weed last night and threw away the remainder of my weed and bacci etc before I went to bed. 

I've woken up terrified but determined as hell. This is it, no more avoiding. 

Any words of encouragement, support, motivation or just plain empathy... All would be incredibly appreciated and welcome... And I hope this post finds you on a good day. ‚ù§Ô∏è",7

When will this pass? 

I started gaining weight last week when and since then had trouble controlling my eating, I feel like I overeat for almost every meal especially in the evening. 

My wound from an operation I had back in May seemed to have opened up a bit and for the first time since surgery I am having pain again.

The weed not only quickly exacerbated my porn issue but also become an issue in-an-of-itself with me escalating to multiple joints sometimes a day and this is how its been for the last 2 years or so.

This may just be a dump of words, but I want y'all to know that it can and will get better.

Freshman year I was introduced to what I thought, at the time, was the best drug money could buy: weed. I'd just graduated high school with a full ride to college. The leftover money from my scholarship allowed me to spend an excess of money on weed... we all know how that goes.

Long story short, I ended up asking my parents for money for rent, I lost my full ride and now I've got student debt to pay off, and I nearly failed multiple classes on multiple occasions. I did fail one major-related class, which was downright embarrassing. The worst part of it all is that I could've have kept my scholarship had I simply checked my mail, but I was too stoned to ever think about that.

I smoked every single day, multiple times a day, for about 2 years straight. Along with a few other drugs, weed took over my life. It defined my attitude, my friends, and my life choices. I'd never been more depressed.

But on New Year's Day of 2019, I decided to finally give it up. After smoking my way into the New Year, I wanted nothing else to do with it. I stayed sober for a year and a month after. 13 months. That was my record. I proceeded to smoke on three occasions in the following couple of weeks after that because I thought I'd overcome my past. I'm not proud of that; it wasn't worth it.

I started my sober streak over. Now, I'm 6 months completely sober and I'm as happy as I could be. I graduated with my Bachelor's, I'm pursuing my Master's and will have it completed in half the time it normally takes. I'll be off to get my PhD after that.

To all of you on this subreddit: thank you. I could not have done what I did without the stories of folks on here and the indirect support I received from reading the personal insights here. And to all those who came seeking help and peace of mind: I promise it's hard. I promise it's going to suck. And I promise it will get better.

Power through.

Much love. Thank you all.",8

I smoked and immediately passed out from exhaustion since it was 8pm and I had been up since 3am and worked yesterday. 
Kinda funny. Got stoned and just fell asleep with a headache. Awful night sleep because it was on that guys futon and my shoes stayed on all night cause I was too tired and high to take them off but I‚Äôll get a better one Tonight 

Anyway here‚Äôs the funny thing that happened, I took my dogs to a state park today with some waterfalls and bumped into a couple (of dudes lol) and they had a dog with them. I noticed the one guys weed pen but my first thought was that it was a dog whistle. So I said, ‚Äúdog whistle that‚Äôs smart‚Äù and the guy got weird and tried to do that ‚Äúhand tuck‚Äù to hide it. 
The one where you cuff your hand and tuck it up with your wrists. Looks silly and super obvious.

It was funny to watch him get uncomfortable and try to hide it. Kinda made me laugh wondering if I‚Äôve ever been that guy. Also hilarious that I thought it was a dog whistle instead of a weed pen. I‚Äôm glad my mind went to the more innocent thing. 

Right when he tried to hide it I was like,  ‚Äúah weed pen‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt mention that I knew what it was, and the urge to ask for a hit had to be subdued but that fear of being caught with weed/ weed stuff is something I don‚Äôt have to worry about while staying sober. 

Also funny the tried to hide it, I have long hair and had on a Goku shirt, short dark grey gym shorts and dirty white vans, so clearly not a cop. Also I was with my dogs in a restricted area of the park, so clearly I say fuck the rules. 

It was empowering to watch him hide it from me.

I'm really happy that this group exists because I feel like there's so much discourse these days about the positive benefits of weed, and not the negatives. I've certainly had my fair share of negative experiences with weed, and it's hard to find people to share that with. This is the first time I've written about this whole experience, so buckle up for a long and twisted tale. 

A little over a year ago, I had a cannabis induced psychotic episode due to smoking dabs out of a vape pen. I had previously been a fairly moderate cannabis user, mostly smoking weed out of a bowl or vapes, sometimes taking edibles and occasionally smoking dabs with an ex boyfriend. But when I returned to my college campus my senior year, I couldn't find any bud so I decided to get a dab pen. I bought some carts from a frat guy (stupid, I know), and quickly got hooked. I was consistently high for about 5 days. It felt fun at first, but very quickly turned sour. 

I started getting really manic and hyperactive, and couldn't stop talking. My roommates and friends were clearly annoyed (I'm normally a pretty chill, quiet person) but not quite concerned yet because nothing crazy had happened. I also wasn't eating much at all because I couldn't sit down long enough for a meal, and was barely sleeping because I kept getting up and reorganized the place I just moved into. I also became hypersexual and was hooking up with multiple people, something I normally never do. My roommates became concerned as soon as I started having delusions. 

I thought this guy I had been talking to who lived out of state was going to propose to me. We weren't even dating. I was getting so excited, was telling some of my friends they would be my bridesmaids/MOHs, and I'm pretty sure I even told my parents. I thought my friends were all planning a surprise engagement party and that's why they were acting weird towards me, when in reality they were just really concerned about my erratic behavior. At one point, I even thought I saw this guy through the window of my neighbor's house. I also thought I was a tech genius and had invented a new computer program that linked Google to Facebook or something crazy like that. All I had actually done was complete some double-authentication security tests and freed up some space on my Mac's memory. FML. 

Anyways, my parents were hearing about my behavior from my roommates and could tell something was up by the way I was texting them. It all came to a head one night when my parents called me and asked me if I needed to go to a hospital. Of course I said no, because in my mind I thought I had a wedding to plan! They were sobbing into the phone and asked me to call emergency mental health services, which I finally did. Given the ineptitude of college mental health services, that didn't help. My poor parents eventually had to drive 5 hours to pick me up in the middle of the night and take me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there for two days and was still really manic and was now agitated because I was in an institution. My mom cried and laid in the hospital bed with me for a while until the anti-psychotics kicked in and I finally fell asleep for the first time in about three days. I woke up and was then transferred to a different hospital that was closer to my parents' house, because they didn't know how long I'd need to stay there and the ones further away were out of network. I only stayed at this other hospital for about one night, because my psychotic symptoms were going away and I really really wanted to leave. My parents came and got me and took me back home to their house. At this point, we weren't sure if I'd be able to return to school because my psychotic symptoms weren't completely gone and they were so worried about me. 

Eventually, I did return to school and only missed the first day of classes. My parents were so scared and stressed, and that's what killed me the most about all of this. I promised them I would never smoke weed again, but here we are over a year later and I've smoked several times. I never experienced any psychotic symptoms again, and have really tried to stop completely, but the social aspect of it and just being a 22 year old made it really hard for me to quit. I had a conversation with them a week ago and came clean and told them I've smoked multiple times. They were devastated, of course, and so was I. I finally realized the importance of truly quitting this time, because our conversation was more like an intervention. I don't want to ever have psychosis again, and I certainly don't want weed to permanently affect me or turn me schizophrenic. I have a full-time job and a lot of hope for my future, and am now accepting that I don't need weed in my life anymore. Even though many of my friends and peers still smoke, it's simply not for me and that's okay. Nobody is going to pressure me to do it, and I am the only person getting in the way of my recovery. 

Sorry this is such a long post, I just had to put it in writing somewhere and this is the best, most anonymous way for me to do so. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way through. I'm now one week clean and am looking forward to adding more days to my sobriety :)",5

It cost me very little financially but it cost me dearly in other ways. I was a slave to smoking and it robbed me of so much. I'd go to great lengths so I could use weed. My life was planned around being high. I didn't drive high so I'd have to get people to drive me around. I'd get frustrated when my pipe was dirty and over the years I'm sure I spent hours cleaning it. At night I'd get so hungry I couldn't stop eating. The first thing on my mind if I woke up in the middle of the night was to smoke more and I did this a lot. This went on for not just years, but decades! Decades of doing something I wasn't really enjoying anymore. Endless loops of negative thoughts, days missed at work because I was so tired, plans cancelled and people avoided because I was high. Missed opportunities because I couldn't commit to things strongly enough. Unrealistic fantasy ideas of things I could do but would never have the ambition to follow through. Half finished projects. Neglected relationships. Forgetfulness. 

What I left behind was not something that was beneficial to me. What I left behind did little good and much bad. It twisted and manipulated 20 plus years of my life. 

Luckily it has finally come to an end. I'm almost 3 months sober, on the 14th of this month. I'm finally getting better. Taking my life back.",31

I almost got online and checked out the prices. I know this is not a good place for my head to be in, so I am taking action. I‚Äôm going to an AA meeting tonight and I‚Äôm going to be as accountable and honest to this page as possible. I know it is not worth another binge in addiction with all of its terrors and consequences. The crazy thing is my life is really good right now. It is insanity to think getting high will solve anything whatsoever. In fact, if I want to start a fire I should take a hit and watch everything I have worked for burn to the ground (while I stand in the middle of it).

Hope you‚Äôre all having a fantastic Labor Day weekend being weed free. I got to 35 days weed free today and this advice helped me greatly so I figured I‚Äôd pass it on. I got these tips from an online course and it definitely changed the game on how to tackle any bad habit.

Since many of our decisions are based from our subconscious mind, it makes it difficult to truly feel like we have self control. What I learned was that if you wrote down the bad behavior (ie smoking) when you were doing it in a notebook or your phone, greater self control is formed. It helps your mind develop better mechanisms for your actions and makes you realize how often you do it, the reason you do it, and why you want to stop. This helped me realize the gravity of the issue I had with weed. I actually got tired of continually writing down that I was smoking again lol.

This other trick has been said many times before but it‚Äôs so true, TRY TO DO SOMETHING ELSE (LIKE GO FOR A WALK) WHENEVER YOU FEEL CRAVINGS AS WELL. Doing some habit that benefits you greatly improves the likelihood of removing the undesirable habit. It also helps in the long run because it makes the good habit seem more like a normal part of your routine.

Hope this helps someone out there! Stay strong and keep your head held high!",20

Each time I end up failing. I feel like I have no self-control and once I think about weed I do everything in my power to get it. When I'm high I always want to be sober and when I am sober I always want to be high. Once I start smoking I keep smoking pretty much every hour. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I am starting to get really scared for myself if I can't get this addiction under control. ,2

I have been a heavy smoker for the past 3 years. It used to be a bowl or two a night, but for some reason right before the pandemic I started getting high throughout the day, which obviously got even worse during quarantine as I was working from home. I‚Äôm a therapist btw, specializing in addictions LOL I know, I know. We are all susceptible to this crap.

Anyways I got super hooked on carts, quit for a whole month and went through hell - couldn‚Äôt eat and lost 15 pounds, night sweats, diarrhea, anxious thoughts and mood swings. After the first 2 weeks though, I started feeling better and my motivation was amazing - I finally started looking for a new job and landed my dream job with a huge pay increase working in couple counselling! 

Then I relapsed. I thought I would be able to start using again, just on Saturday‚Äôs though. But I immediately went back to my old ways the second I relapsed. That‚Äôs addiction af. I had even promised myself I would never go back to my old ways because I was so happy and never wanted to deal with withdrawal again. 

Two months later, I have been smoking flower all day every day even after starting my new job. I finally quit a week ago and the first 2 days were fine, but then had so much stomach upset on the third day. Vomited twice on the fourth day, couldn‚Äôt eat. On the fifth day I went for a 15k hike (I know that wasn‚Äôt a good idea but my bf and I had this trip planned for a while). Threw up on the hike and went to the ER after because I was so shaky and terrified that something was really wrong. This was a really low point for me. The vomiting was likely due to dehydration even though I drank like a million gallons of water, but I was scared for my life because my heart rate was steady at 120 the whole time I was there, I probably was having a low grade panic attack. They had to do two ECGs cuz they found an irregular heartbeat - again likely due to dehydration and ‚Äúpoor nutrition‚Äù. They wanted to keep me overnight to give me some IV fluids but my bf thankfully convinced me to go back to the hotel with him and took care of me. The thought of staying in the hospital alone was so terrifying- interestingly my heart rate started to go down once I left the hospital. I felt better in the morning after drinking plenty of fluids and Gatorade and getting some good cuddles.

My stomach is still a mess especially in the morning and I‚Äôve got the night sweats, poor appetite, tired even though I sleep a lot, feeling hot then cold. But I got this. I have zero cravings for weed because of how traumatic this has all been. I‚Äôm so excited for the future. My boyfriend and I are starting house hunting next month and I refuse to be a homeowner with an active weed addiction!",9

I plan to post to this group everyday. I also believe I read there's a discord that I can connect with, so I am going to look for that.

I would take the boredom and feeling flat over the turbulance of weed addiction any day. However, with soberness comes a level of presence that I was avoiding in my weed use. Because I was comfortable in my haze, I didn't make much effort to seek stimulation, certainly no challenges and now I have a backlog of house projects that I've flaked out on that I am prioritising. 

This has culminated in me feeling very bored with life. I've not been particularly interested in seeking out company as I'm still levelling out and not much has happened this year except DIY projects. I was fine with a boring life when I was high every evening but now I'm in this space where I need to catch up with a lot of boring jobs off the back of very little stimulation in recent times.

I'm trusting that when the time is ready, I'll pick up a new hobby, make time for more books and fill my cup. I was thinking that this must be a transition that a lot of addicts have to go through and it's got to be one of the first hurdles to overcome in sobriety and getting your life back together. I'm OK with this but it's just a case of awareness and acceptance. I'm lucky that I have an amazing partner and a nice home so I have good things going on but the boredom is still something I need to keep an eye on myself with and navigate consciously. I'm sure a lot of you have these days so I thought I would share.",11

I‚Äôve been smoking for a better part of a decade now, and have done so on a daily basis. I feel like my brain has developed itself around cannabis and that quitting is going to set me back in life, as silly as that might seem. I‚Äôve smoked for everything in my life, to help myself get through the day. How do I learn to live life normally? I‚Äôve been through a lot of bad things in life and cannabis helped me cope. I always overlooked at how much I depended on it, usually justifying it however I could. 

That‚Äôs the thing though, because I always smoked it before doing anything, my brain adapted to cannabis in a way that it came to rely on it to feel normal. Anytime I tried to quit my brain fog just stays and I go back to smoking so I can feel normal. I‚Äôm not progressing in my life, so it‚Äôs like I have to step back to go further. However, when I smoke all the time I don‚Äôt progress either. Hell, for me to even consider writing this and actually going through with it required that I get high first. It‚Äôs pathetic, I‚Äôm letting cannabis rule my life in ways that it shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just so hard for me to stop though because it‚Äôs such an integral part of my daily life.

2020-09-07 10:12:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/io84jx/terrified_of_going_through_withdrawal_again/,Terrified of going through withdrawal again,"Hi guys. I'm struggling a lot right now. I've recently been getting anxiety attacks from pot, and switching to less potent stuff just isn't working. I'm realizing that I am addicted.

I used this community about two years ago to quit cold turkey. It was awful, but people here definitely helped me. 
I struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder & anxiety, and the withdrawal symptoms hit sooo hard. 
I was crying every morning, crippled with anxiety, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, suicidal thoughts, the whole lot.  

I lasted three months until I romanticized pot and totally undermined the awful withdrawal I went through. I have been smoking daily since then. I smoke about an Oz a month.

I know that I am addicted to weed. I need to stop because I am getting withdrawal and huge cravings whenever I'm not stoned. Ive been smoking the less potent stuff and it helps in the moment, but I'm waking up 6 hours later with huge anxiety and mood swings.

I am just super terrified of going through cold turkey again. Last time I was basically a total write off at work for about 3 weeks.. and my new job this time around isn't nearly as forgiving. 

 I know that I need to quit and that it will be so beneficial towards my mental health. I am so worried about losing my job throughout the journey, and I feel mentally weak right now. I know there is never a ""good time"" or ""convenient time"" to quit, but I don't know what to do.

I would love some advice, because I am so lost.

Thank you for listening.

Edit: after reading posts from other users, I have decided to go through with cold turkey. You can find my day one thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ioalri/day_1_no_better_time_to_quit_than_today/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Basically if I was going to do something I better be high for it. I always wanted to quit and would put pressure I myself and beat myself up every day that today was the day. But hence I would still smoke and the pattern continued for years. This last year the pressure got more intense and my self disdain grew. My mental health got really out of order to the point I was concerned I might be going crazy. Being quarantined alone and high all the time can take a toll. I wanted to quit and took some small breaks waiting to smoke until the evening and in more moderation but ultimately this was not what I needed because I would not be able to control myself and would smoke before I told myself I would. Textbook addiction. 


Well amidst all of this I started having some really strange bowel movements I‚Äôm talking like constant diarrhea for months. This happened to me last year too and I went to the doctors. They found blood in my stool and basically I had all of the symptoms of colon cancer but I didn‚Äôt believe I had it and I didn‚Äôt like my doctor. Ultimately my symptoms subsided and time went on. Flash forward to this year and the whole thing happened with Chadwick the black panther guy simultaneously my symptoms came back. I was concerned for myself that I never confirmed I did not have colon cancer and started getting paranoid about it. 

Well one day I got really high off an edible and started thinking about my life and what if I did have cancer. I went out and talked to my wife and told her I was scared and just opened up about everything. I imagined myself having a terminal disease and that if I looked back on my life it would be such a waste because all I wanted to do was get high and do stupid shit all the time. How I couldn‚Äôt do it and how much I would miss her and my 1 year old daughter. I broke down crying and opened up about how painful my life had been growing up dealing with abuse and a parent who I didn‚Äôt feel really loved me, getting bullied etc etc. 

I then started to think about how I would fight tooth and nail if I did have cancer. Then I started to think about my addiction as the disease and how it was sucking my life out and giving me a slow drawn out death and even worse a meaningless life where my main purpose is to get high. I thought why am I not fighting this disease in the same way I would if I had cancer? 

So that was it I am now 4 days sober (quit drinking a couple months back as well) to help myself I went out of town with family to their little lake house and just relaxed I took more naps than I have ever taken and just enjoyed time with my daughter and my family. I am a follower of Jesus Christ and spent a lot of time talking to him and God and expressed my appreciation for my life, gratefully accepted my journey and thanked him for his grace. 

Well I am taking normal shits again and feel great. I got a home test and there was no blood on my stool. Ultimately I think addiction was the true disease I am fighting and the pressure I was putting on myself was the cause of my bowel problems. I will have to fight it the rest of my life but every day I win the battle the war gets easier. 

My biggest findings so far have been: 

‚Ä¢ If you want to get sober put yourself into a
 new environment and don‚Äôt bring any weed with you 
‚Ä¢while you are recovering do whatever you want to feel better (just don‚Äôt do the thing you are having trouble with) 
‚Ä¢breathing exercises and taking pretend hits of a joint or bong really works
‚Ä¢ open up and share what you are going through with people you trust 
‚Ä¢read the posts in this group daily and follow sober people on social media 
‚Ä¢ cut out friends and situations that aren‚Äôt going to help you get clean 
‚Ä¢I am here for you, praying for you and God is here for you too.  
‚Ä¢acknowledge your journey is different than anyone else‚Äôs so anything anyone offers you is just their perspective. 

I hope my infant stage of recovery offers some hope/encouragement to someone. I know that all of you posting have helped me tremendously",11

\- I haven't made any errors at work since I quit (I work in a highly regulated industry where the smallest mistakes can cause huge problems)

\- I am more able to regulate my emotions better and not get upset so easily

\- No more brain fog/anxiety when having conversations with people

\- People close to me have said my face looks brighter and healthier

\- I've gained about 8kgs (I was severely underweight when smoking)

\- The strange dreams are beginning to become less vivid and disturbing

\- I'm saving more money now than I ever did in the 4.5 years of smoking non-stop

\- I spend more time with my family instead of choosing to stay home and smoke

After so many attempts of quitting, I think this time I've finally caught some momentum and I don't ever want to go back to my previous life.

For anyone whose just quit recently or quitting for the first time, sometimes it can take multiple attempts at quitting to kick the habit, and relapsing is a perfectly normal part of recovery.

Our mistakes are a necessary learning opportunity.

2020-09-06 23:16:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/inzufb/the_journey_to_quitting/,The Journey to Quitting,"Hi everyone, 

After spending a few hours catching up on the top posts from this month, I've finally accepted it's time to let go of weed and stop smoking altogether. I find myself relating more and more to others' experiences and wanted to share my own 'journey' on here. Thanks to everyone on here for being so positive, it's really helped! Hopefully, this can help some people to stop and think before they go down the same path I (and many, many others) did. For so long, I refused to believe I was addicted. Now, I have to accept I am addicted, and for me that's the first stage to kicking the habit. 

I started smoking about 5 years ago, every now and then with university friends after a test or exam. At university, nearly all my closest friends were weed smokers and great people! The 2 years before I first got high, some of them would try and peer-pressure me into taking a hit, but I never once gave in. One day, I just decided to try it, see what I was missing out on. 

At the start, I really enjoyed smoking, putting a movie on and stuffing my face with food alongside friends. It was very enjoyable. Sure, the next day I'd wake up feeling a little groggy, but I'd get on with my day and this would quickly pass. Weed was a very small part of my life, and definitely not a priority. 

Once I finished university, I moved in with a friend and had my own little place that became the chill spot. I was studying a masters and had a very flexible part time job where I could pretty much choose when I wanted to work. Almost every night without fail, my friends would come over and we'd smoke. This just became the norm and still, I really enjoyed it! 

Fast forward to today, 3 years later. I've moved abroad and smoked almost every day in those 3 years. I now find myself resenting weed and myself for smoking it and letting it eat up so much of my life. The excitement I used to feel when rolling up a joint is gone. I'm tired of feeling high. I'm tired of feeling anxious and unmotivated, disinterested in everything. I'm tired of putting my goals and ambitions in life on the back-burner, tired of not being my best self. I find myself in an endless game of chasing the high, trying to match that feeling when I first smoked. 

Looking back at the last few years has really given me a wake up call. Whilst many of my friends were building connections and a career, I was stuck inside getting high, convincing myself this is the good life. I've conditioned myself to feel comfortable and to not want to leave that comfort zone. I'm now ready to leave that comfort zone, move on and realise my potential.

Started when I was 14 and I'm 20 now. I've gotten to the point where I almost don't even enjoy smoking anymore it's just so habitual for me I do it without even really thinking about it. Well long story short I bought a dab rig to be more conservative and well, that was a mistake. I started dabbing every day, several times a day. I'm so lethargic, my speech is slow, I feel like I'm constantly wading through a mental sludge, and my lungs have taken a pretty decent hit too. I actually ended up going to the doctor because my habit was causing swelling in my diaphragm and chest. Well anyways I'm ready to stop. I want to quit for me. I want to be the productive, goal oriented self I know I can be. I've tried quitting several times before. (The longest I went was 3 months junior year) I'm posting this here to make a written commitment to myself and to have something to reflect on when in craving. Any support would be appreciated. Your guys' stories have pushed me to make this change in my life.",2

I just stopped because I was busy with work and marijuana hasn‚Äôt been on my mind. I‚Äôve just been living life and not thinking about it. 

Since then I‚Äôve became a manager at my job so that‚Äôs really where my focus comes in. With me being a manager I wanted to be more focused. I can‚Äôt be forgetful of tasks I was supposed to do or anything like that. I also just moved to a bigger house (currently still packing from the old house into the new). 

I‚Äôve gone months to years without smoking, my problem was that I would eventually return. I‚Äôm hoping this time around I‚Äôll stay clean for good. The good thing though , as years went on my marijuana usage got shorter and shorter. I now know it‚Äôs not a necessity as I thought during my college days. 

To anyone struggling, my best advice is to find hobbies you truly enjoy. Hang out with friends and family who don‚Äôt smoke , stay busy, and visit this subreddit often. These were key as it helped me.

&#x200B;

Backstory: for the guts of 4/5 weeks in a row this summer, I vaped THC oil approx 5 days a week (usually it was just once a day I got stoned, although maybe equally as often twice, and only very very rarely three times).

About two weeks ago I began to experience a great deal of dissociation (felt like I was viewing my reality, not living it) the days following a lot of THC vaping and quite brain foggy. I then decided to stop.

Move forward two weeks to yesterday, I had some again at a social gathering.

&#x200B;

This morning, I feel fine, but I have decided to throw my vape in the bin, and have offered my thc oil to others. I have officially quit.

&#x200B;

While I know people on this sub-reddit have smoked/vaped much more excessively and for longer time periods than I have, my reasoning for quitting is that I am concerned about things such as my intellectual potential and short term memory being affected from my month of weed. This is because I am 22, beginnning a PhD due to finishing top in my Bsc course, I do not want to damage my potential great future (not to blow my own trumpet).

Obviously also feeling dissociated is also a major factor to wanting to quit. I havent felt dissociated since taking the hiatus, but I am unsure if I have permanently affected my memory or intellect (I know I just mentioned this before anyone makes short term memory jokes hahah, at least my humour is unchanged for sure!). My motivation remains unchanged to begin this PhD journey.

Does anyone have any support to offer (like I have stopped early that I shouldnt be too worried), or truthful criticism (like I may have actually affected my intellectual potential/short term memory permantly) or anything to just ease my mind? Literally anything in regards to what I mentioned would help.

My anxiety worsened as my tolerance lowered. I was taking 1-2 hits off a vape pen maybe once a week, and eventually didn't see the point in doing that.

I realized that my environment influenced my cannabis intake. I was working as a budtender, and that's how my co-workers socialized. I wanted to fit in. I notice that I generally only drink when I'm around other people, as well--I don't have an addictive personality, I have a SUGGESTIBLE personality.

Idk if it was ever something I really enjoyed. Weed triggered my anxiety, but I liked the activity, the ritual. Something about rolling a joint comforted me. 

I hung out with my friend the other day, and he offered me a bong hit. 'Nah,' I said.

Nah.

I am applying to jobs in the cannabis industry now. There are  so many opportunities in the field, and I don't want to miss out just b/c I used to get high with co-workers after a shift. I'm not worried about being influenced by my environment this time. Obviously if it becomes a temptation, I'll quit. But I don't see that happening. I know that weed ultimately makes me feel worse, so...why touch it?

It's been over a month since I hit my vape pen. I've had a bunch of cannabis products sitting around my apartment, collecting dust. No desire to touch the 1/8th of flower I bought in March, or the edibles I stored in my freezer 9 months ago.

I know a lot of people notice a huge difference after quitting--I haven't. Just a feeling of freedom.",13

My wife and I are currently on our second full day of putting this chapter behind us, I have been a habitual/heavy user for the better part of a decade and a half and my wife has been smoking heavily for roughly 6 years. There have been some opportunities that we have passed on that would have helped a lot with things like greater financial security, being a more psychologically and emotionally well adjusted couple, all kinds of stuff for the creature comfort that is pot. Fortunately for both of us after long, honest, and reflective discussion with her we decided that a change needed to be made so we are making it. I realize that it's going to get incredibly hard over the coming weeks. My sleep pattern is already very erratic as I work overnights and I know it's only going to get worse before it gets better.

(long post),"I originally felt really strongly about quitting . But 60 days ago I had my last sip of alcohol and had been focusing on that. For the first month or so the plan was to quit weed soon after. I felt really confident because I finally kicked the alcohol craving. But now two months in with out alcohol and I‚Äôve lost all sensation of confidence in quitting weed.

I really did abuse alcohol. And alcoholism runs in my family. Quitting is something I never thought I would do. Although I didn‚Äôt drink every day, I drank too much. It‚Äôs easy to spend every night at the bar when you live right down town. But something finally clicked and I haven‚Äôt looked back . Even have been meeting friends at the bars on the weekends - haven‚Äôt had the slightest temptation. Well maybe a slight one, but haven‚Äôt caved. 

When it comes to pot, I started smoking at like 15, I‚Äôm 29 now. It wasn‚Äôt until my 20s that I started using it a TON. I remember there being a short period of time where I just wasn‚Äôt into it any more - for a while. But it‚Äôs always been my crutch and how I am identified. Always the stone. For the most part , in comparison to alcohol anyway, I‚Äôve always held my own regardless of the pot. I was always messing up on alcohol, blacking out, doing something stupid. But pot was my safe haven. Held a steady job since 16, completed a 2 year degree and even just recently became a licensed insurance agent.  But I do think the pot is holding me back. 

I have suffered from anxiety all my life. I still remember smoking on a burn cruise with a friend at like 18 and suddenly having the biggest panic attack yet. Existential dread, as my dad refers to it. That gut wrenching feeling that leaves me questioning reality or that life is ending as I know it . There were several more of those moments to come, especially when smoking heavily. Like the time I smoked a hookah of keef and went and sat outside with headphones in. I completely zoned out and had the scariest out of out of body experiences. My friends had to carry me back inside. 

These moments would come and go until eventually I constantly felt the dread. No matter how much I smiled, something was crippling me inside. 

To this day, I don‚Äôt ever smoke before work. But I smoke as soon as I get home. And usually again before bed. On weekends , as soon as I wake up. I‚Äôm not going to lie - I love it. I don‚Äôt feel the disconnect I felt towards alcohol. But I need to realize that pot is holding me back as much as the booze. The anxiety isn‚Äôt as bad - because I learned to manage it - but it‚Äôs still there . 

Last week I started hosting at a local restaurant . I got paid this week and collected my tips and man it felt great. Then my boyfriend and I smoked the last blunt worth of bud. Our dealer lives right down the hall... we could totally get more. But thinking about spending that money I just made , really puts things into perspective. Money is really tight right now. Part of a big reason why I quit the alcohol (and because I gained a ton of weight and other health reasons ). But I can‚Äôt convince myself to not enjoy this weekend relaxing with smoking. I want to so bad. I want to kick this habit . I want to prove to myself that I can. 

Everyone else‚Äôs posts inspire me and give me healthy insight to what is to come when I finally say NO. 

I hope this extraordinarily lengthy post resonates with at least one other person. Although, I know this is not my journal - it felt really good to write about.",14

So I‚Äôve been trying to quit for a long time with numerous relapses because I just wanted to get high, thought I earned it, or put myself in a position where pot was was easily accessible and all I had to do to smoke was ‚Äúsay yes,‚Äù or pot found me, I‚Äôve literally found weed before. 

Well 15 days ago I stopped hanging out with a friend because all we would do was smoke weed and honestly I just didn‚Äôt want to be around this person anymore, differences is beliefs and attitudes. Also he caused a scene in a Waffle House by crying and yelling ‚Äúis it because I‚Äôm a faggot‚Äù - hilarious from an outside point of view. And yes he‚Äôs gay, we were talking about why a community didn‚Äôt want to hang with him. I told him to not bring it up around me anymore because I‚Äôve already offered the only Advice I had many times before. 

After deciding not to hang out anymore I had no more access to pot and that has really helped. I have no dealers numbers, and I don‚Äôt really know any, I‚Äôve basically smoked for 5 years by getting weed through friends. 

The first couple of days I was irritable, not myself, and very depressed, Once a week came I really wasn‚Äôt thinking about pot much. But when ever I would leave work I would think about going to that guys house to smoke weed. 

About 9 days in I hooked up with this chick and asked if she had any weed, she didn‚Äôt and she couldn‚Äôt find her pen either I kind of lucked out there. 

Yesterday I got the leg shakes when leaving work and knew it was because of Joneses for weed. I was in the private bathroom for like 10 minutes, felt like an hour, sort of working through the urge to text that friend for a smoke sesh. I didn‚Äôt go through with it and instead when home and played with my dogs. Honestly a responsibility give my dogs a good time instead of go get high makes it easier to make the decision to go home instead of go smoke. But when I am stoned my dogs like me more lol. 

So today is day 15 and I got off work at 1pm- I sat in my car for a good 20 minutes as waves of ‚Äú Go get stoned‚Äù ran through my head. I almost texted that friend. I texted another friend who‚Äôs out camping with his daughter to see what he‚Äôs up to. I texted another girl to flirt. I guess I wanted a release of some sort and was trying to tell myself I earned it after a week of work. I thought of how sweet that first inhale would be and how the smoke would feel in my mouth. I thought of the burning end of a joint or blunt. Then I thought of the smell being stuck on me. Then I thought of going home stoned and making my dogs stay inside with me while I was lazy. Then the wave of ‚Äú Go get stoned‚Äù went away and I drove home, took my dogs for a walk and rubbed one out. Lol sorry for the extra details. 

While I haven‚Äôt been getting stoned I made some progress on the movie I‚Äôm writing and I love that. 
I enjoy working on it when I do and I even wanted to get stoned for artistic inspiration today. That was one of the foolish things I told myself trying to rationalize getting high. 

Well I‚Äôm writing all this because I‚Äôm sad to say that tomorrow I‚Äôm going to break my streak. Yes, that guy texted me today and for some reason I agreed to hang out, it‚Äôs slight pitty for him and me. 

Hate me, be disappointed, or Understand. 
I couldn‚Äôt just let this streak go undocumented though. Honestly it builds confidence in me to have done this. 

By the way I feel so much healthier, my mind is clearer, I‚Äôm more pleasant, confident, attractive after 15 days no pot. And my lungs appreciate it a lot. 

But tomorrow I‚Äôm gonna smoke as much Fucking weed as I can get my hands on then try to score some to smoke on Monday, I‚Äôm probably just bored or hate myself. I doubt I hate myself though lol 

Well if you read this, thank you. 
That has been my experience the last 15 days. 
Hopefully I can give it up for good after tomorrow or Monday. 

Faithfully yours

I used to smoke cigarettes alongside cannabis but I stopped all cigarettes and nicotine consumption back on 21st June and haven‚Äôt looked back. I did smoke weed excessively initially when quitting the cigarettes. Between dry herb vape and pure blunts I treated it just like cigarettes and did a number on both my mental state and wallet. 

After spending insane amounts (¬£80-160 a day) I committed to stopping weed on 20th August. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt go entirely to plan and I have succumbed to smoking since then but now here I am back to (so nearly) day 10 off the smokes. 

I can safely say this is the longest I have ever abstained since I started and I‚Äôm really starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm using a prescription substance to help fight the fatigue and depression (not sure I‚Äôm allowed to talk about what exactly that is here so I‚Äôm leaving it at that) and whiskey/scotch to get me to bed as required but this now marks the longest I‚Äôve kept off weed ever since starting. 

The mental clarity I‚Äôm starting to regain is brilliant. Dreaming again is great. Not smelling of cannabis is pretty damn nice for me, my partner and my daughter. 

Not really got a conclusion other than fuck yeah. I am done with weed and gonna focus on making my life better day by day and getting back to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù that I‚Äôve never had throughout my teenage or adult life.

Anyone reading this that may still be struggling to kick the habit, know that if I can stop cigarettes and weed after consuming them for around 2/3rds of my life then anyone can!",5

It‚Äôs true! Everything you read here about the negatives with marijuana are true. I think the most dangerous thing about it is that it‚Äôs not dangerous at all! Not life threatening at least. You can‚Äôt overdose, you can keep goin and goin and without even realizing it you‚Äôve fallen down a dark path. It takes a strong individual to come to the realization that they need to stop. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I have a deep appreciation for this sub.

These are the things I‚Äôve learned after I‚Äôve decided to stop using. Aside from your appetite and your sleep, there are many other factors that weed controls. For me at least, I never realized how many feelings I suppress by using. I‚Äôve always tried to be aware about using when I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúgood‚Äù mood and not as an escape, but let‚Äôs be real we wouldn‚Äôt be addicted if that was the case. The first week I stopped, all the emotions I was suppressing came out all at once! When I say all at once I mean it, I would be angry one minute then crying the next, I would have moments of happiness and motivation then pure self hatred next. My patience for people was at an all time low. Luckily I wasn‚Äôt going out much bc of COVID but goddamn when I did I would snap at the most random things. Some justifiable some not so much. As a usually calm and level headed person this was strange to me.

It took a bit of time to realize that this current person is not who I really am and that years of use may have altered some things within me. I decided to stick it through and acknowledge the fact that my body is adjusting to the changes I‚Äôve made and boy am I glad I did that! It‚Äôs been about a month and almost every aspect of my life has improved. At the end of the day using any type of substance to cope with difficult emotions is unhealthy and I urge everyone to acknowledge their emotions and to try to deal with them head on instead of avoiding them and having them backfire later. 

Once again I‚Äôd like to thank this sub for really opening my eyes and I hope this post helped some people that might be going through what I experienced. Lastly I‚Äôd like to say; stay strong, never stop believing in yourself and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask your loved ones for help! We‚Äôre on this rollercoaster ride together.

Of course, easy access makes it so much easier to use, but it just now occurred to me that a lot of my cravings are just for the thrill of being able to buy it legally in the first place. 

Being old, I‚Äôm always all OMG I CAN BUY LEGAL WEED I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT IN MY LIFETIME PARTY ON DUDE!  It‚Äôs the thrill of getting away with something, even though I‚Äôm actually not. 

Compounding this is that budtenders are all really nice, and some places greet me by name, so going to the weed store has become something to genuinely look forward to. 

So, I‚Äôm working on identifying that specific trigger when it happens, and letting it pass: do I want to ‚Äúbe high‚Äù or just ‚Äúgo get high‚Äù? Hope this helps someone.

So I started smoking when I was 18, started slow at first, maybe a gram a week, then slowly increased over the years to 4-5 blunts a day by the time I was 23. Then on an average day, out of no where, I got high and had a massive panic attack, I felt my body going numb, my heart began to race, and I thought I was having a heart attack. 

Luckily I had studied meditation and breathing exercise for the last few years, so after a couple minutes I calmed myself down and got in control. I thought it was a freak accident, since I had never in my life experienced panic or anxiety on any level. However that experience carried over onto the next day, I could feel my heart beating and every little thing threw me into anxiety. I continued to smoke though, for the next few weeks, and every time would have a huge panic attack. I turned into a hypochondriac, I was sure something was wrong with my body and I was gonna die. Any bodily sensation would send me spiraling. 

I quit smoking half a year ago, and my sanity is much better. My anxiety and panic is nearly gone, however I still will have episodes of panic every now and then. I eat healthy, workout, stretch, mediate, and stay busy, which has helped.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, or could explain what might‚Äôve happened to my brain. How can I go years smoking with no problem, then in one moment totally lose control?",2

Last week: had a bad flare up of my back pain. It was a stressful week: I lost my job and a few other things changed in my life. I convinced myself it was just back pain or muscle pain (as sometimes I got referred arm/chest pain) and went out last Saturday night. Sunday at 3am I vomited profusely, from drinking and smoking before bed. Sunday I felt like death. Monday I didn‚Äôt feel much better but I had to mow the lawn, so I smoked and went to mow. I could not for the life of me get my blood pressure down and it felt like I was going to die. I worked myself into some panic and my mom called emergency rescue, who took my vitals and told me I was fine. 

The next few days, I decided to quit everythjng: alcohol weed nic caffeine. 

My body has been hell. Palpitations, muscle spasms, swelling near a lymph node that has history of acting up (and may be related to the back pain), constipation, acid reflux, gas, frequent urination, ruminating thoughts, horrible dreams and anxiety attacks. My body feels broken.

In the time since I‚Äôve been to 2 cardiologists who both told me things look fine (even wearing a holter monitor for 24h, which only led to me discovering I have a low night heart rate which is normal).

I‚Äôm still scared I‚Äôm going to drop dead from a number of disorders, from embolism to ruptured spleen to heart attack to stroke. 

Can someone please assure me this isn‚Äôt abnormal. I feel insane. The last time I had a massive panic attack and quit weed I went through the same thing but less intense. I thought I had a stroke that time as I was having numbness in the left side of my body but multiple CT/MRI scans told me I was fine. Just can‚Äôt shake that feeling of impending death.

It started occasionally  skipping school and chopping up a mix with my mates in the bushes. I did this for a greater part of the year only to stop during year 8.



During the early months of year 9 a mate of mine started smoking and I fell back into it MUCH harder this time.

 I started heading down to the local park near the school, known for being a really fucked up place. Everything goes on there you name it, knife fights, ice pipes, used needles,  junkies, and drugged fucked ""kids"" stauching (it's a aus word for unprovoked attacking) anybody with anything nice.

 It was the norm at my school to just head down in the morning, chop up a bowl with whoever's down there and  go to school completely braindead. I kid you not, theres properly 1 in 20 kids that dont do it. 

Anyway year 10 and I'm selling ounces making petty cash that I would spend all on tobacco and more weed anyway. I sustained my self smoking 4-5 sessions a day along with chain smoking cigarettes for 2 years to date just today. 

I dont think I can do this shit anymore. Ive done other drugs and had almost no worries at all. Coke, benzos, mdma, lean after taking them I felt like I didnt need to take them again for a good while and kept to it.
Weed on the other hand has its hooks sunk so far into me idk if I can leave it.

I can tell weeds my fucking head. Terrible mood swings, zero attention span and barely any motivation for anything except for obtaining  more weed, more sex and more money.

About two months ago I quit successfully for over a month, and as many have heard before, I fell into the trap again. I live in Melbourne, Australia. And when I reached a month the last time I quit the lockdown restrictions because of COVID were loosened. Before the lockdown, I'd never smoked daily for longer than two weeks, as I had school and would never smoke during weekdays etc.

 So when I was a month in, and the restrictions were loosened, I let myself believe I could smoke when I'm with my friends on a weekend trip, which worked as I didn't smoke for a week when I got back, but of course then you start telling yourself ""I can have one now without doing it daily"".

And then, the second wave.

I found myself in even tighter lockdown restrictions, with a curfew, 1 hour allowed outside the house etc. And with this I found myself finding comfort in weed once again. 

But here is day 1 again. Expect me to be very active around here! We can all get through it together, and I'm looking forward to not 'needing' weed anymore.

I'll be honest guys it has not been that hard. I have withdrawals but they are more fastidious than tempting. Kinda like a headache rather than a calling to smoke something. If it gets really bad I workout or do chores and I feel better by accomplishing something. 

Anyway here's the the trigger that made me quit:

Last Wednesday I was at my dealers house smoking with him and a few new guys. One of them starting arguing about how 1984 is happening now in America through the medical system. 
That was the moment. This guy who has not even read the damn book was constantly rolling weed and not stopping about stupid conspiracy theories. I felt like a saying something but was too high to answer back.
My friend/dealer and the other guy were not giving in to his idiocy and just ignored him for the most part. I was fuming inside by the sheer stupidity.
I left and waited next to my car to sober up before driving the 5 minutes drive back to my place. I decided that night was the last time I would get high.

The lettuce in my den:

Now I still have 1/2 oz in my den. I'm going to take it back to my dealer to see if I can get some cash back for it. I'm not expecting all for it but something. He's a long term friend of mine and it'll be a test for both of us. He knows I quit and I predict he'll be supportive or neutral about it. I think I'm strong enough to not fall for the trap, either my own or his.
I'll update the post after the deed is done. 

Hopefully my day counter won't reset.

UPDATE:

I went to my dealer's house to return the weed. It went pretty well all things considered.

Turns out I had 1 oz instead of only 1/2oz. Guy gave me $100 back so woohoo!

I hangout with him a bit while he was smoking weed. He tried to pass me the blunt 3 times, I always refused. He wasn't tempting me or anything he was just high and going through the motions. Everytime he was like ""oh sorry bro"" and kept smoking.

After 1.5 h I decided there was no reason for me to stay anymore and that if I was trying to prove something to myself I got the achievement. 

Made out the den, my house is weed free, I have an extra $100, to put the cherry on the cake I tested my urine and I'm clean.

But thank you to everyone in this sub, you've been a fantastic support so far and I've had some really helpful suggestions from people! Appreciate it because nobody I know in real life has been in this situation before and as much as a few of my close friends know the situation and do support me, it's just hard when they don't really understand from this side of things.

I would feel ashamed that I wasn‚Äôt in control of MY OWN SELF.

I would feel embarrassed by my (perceived) weak nature.

I would feel shock and anger that I couldn‚Äôt just snap out of it!!!!!!

I would feel overwhelmed by the realization that this drug had control over me. 

I felt stuck on a hamster wheel. 

I felt a lack of trust in myself. It tanked my self-esteem massively because I would constantly say/think one thing and then do another. 

I‚Äôve been clean for going almost a year and a half, and the last time I relapsed, I said these things to my therapist. It wasn‚Äôt that I just got high another day, it was that I truly felt that I had betrayed myself once again. Long after the relapse high wore off, I felt fucking pitiful. Like I didn‚Äôt have the strength to do what I KNEW was best for me. What I KNEW I wanted so bad but couldn‚Äôt give to myself.

Expressing the feelings I had around relapse has helped me stick to my sobriety this time. No cravings, no desire, no temptation to go back. I don‚Äôt want to ever feel that way about myself again. 

If you have had trouble relapsing before or feel tempted now, I encourage you to really tap into how you feel the day, even hour after that hit. You betrayed yourself again. Don‚Äôt give in.",2

My laughter is sweeter when I am sober
My breath comes easy, and I am my own
The morning is heaven when I am sober
The once hateful daylight soaks into my bones

My eyes are much brighter
My legs are much lighter
My heart swells with courage for I am a fighter
My dreams, wayward snowbirds, have returned to their perches
My unconscious frivols and fables unravel
My memory recovers, I know what my worth is
My mind is decluttered, I speak, rather than ramble

My laughter is sweeter when I am sober
I'm done with my flight from myself and my soul
My life is imperfect, and far, far from over
Unburdened, I stand now to watch it unfold",63

The good things that happened never felt like enough, or what I really wanted. I made a big change early last year when I cut my toxic parents out of my life. That decision made me miserable even though it felt and still feels absolutely right. 

This year I wanted to take another step. Quit my job that left me burned out, quit my therapy that felt like a bad fit, quit weed, and travel the world. Unfortunately, the pandemic hit right after I quit, and I found myself basically stranded, and it felt like all that was there for me was weed.

Unfortunately, the weed has seemed to only make me more miserable. While I'm not doing *nothing* with my life, it still feels far emptier than it should. I'm retreating from social contacts, neglecting personal projects, and living off my savings in a haze. I think the pandemic has made weed stand out even more as a net negative, because I have so little else going on.

When my current stash ran out last weekend, I felt more than ever that I had to stop to put myself on a better path. I've been a habitual user for 8 years, and an occasional user 4 years before that. Weed was part of my counter-culture identity; it helped me break out of my parents' toxic programming, be less hard on myself, and feel present in the moment. But its drawbacks can't be waved away. The lethargy, anxiety, and lack of motivation are seriously holding me back from making the most of my life.

I have something now which I didn't have when I started, and that's meditation. With that and exercise, I believe that I can experience all of the positives of weed without actually having to toke. And then I can actually have a social life, I can meet new people, and feel fuller, warmer, and happier!

In summary, I think it's harder to quit for me with nothing to do, but it's also clearer than ever that it's the right choice because of the isolation. I'm 3 days sober and so glad I found this community. I wish everyone the best on your own journeys!",8

The pandemic has been stressful and left me bored at home for long hours, and I turned to cannabis for comfort and joy, but the energy exchange has become too much. With a daily habit of smoking after work in the evening, I end up feeling joyful and energized for three hours or so, and then suffer an energy low for two hours after that. I go to sleep later than I prefer, and wake up unmotivated just before work; I drink extra coffee to get me through, feel low during the day, and then just after work finishes, I smoke up. The energy and motivation issues are not all to blame on cannabis; I turned to smoking because some of these issues were present, but at this point cannabis is clearly making things worse. Today and tomorrow I plan not to smoke; this weekend I go camping and plan not to take cannabis; and that would give me a good few days to plow through initial withdrawal feelings. As I write this, I anticipate a big challenge being finding new sources of entertainment and joy. Maybe I'll read some new fiction :) Or watch more movies :) Or enjoy the basketball playoffs :) or... make art and music! Though I imagine I'll need energy neutral activities, and art and music can take energy even as they're delightful... so maybe something more passive.

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts centered around anxiety lately. I think it would help those still smoking and also going through withdrawals for those who have quit to share our before and after stories with anxiety. Here‚Äôs mine....

I smoked for 12-13 years, daily use.  I never connected the dots btwn my anxiety and my weed usage until now that I am 2 months sober.  The difference is night and day. When i was smoking, I‚Äôd had  generalized anxiety about anything that required effort from me. Social anxiety was the big one for me. But also, anxiety about any major change that would happen in my life. Like debilitating anxiety, to the point where I think I was becoming an agoraphobe. Leaving my house was a major challenge if it wasn‚Äôt some place that was 5-10 away. I took a road trip for my 40th birthday and was extremely anxious about leaving the city and being so far away from home. A friend invited me on a road trip a few months later and it was the same deal. Work was hard bc I was always so anxious to be around the same people for any amount of time for fear they would see through my work persona to the real me who felt like a dejected freak. Starting a coding bootcamp was an idea that i somehow came up with that was going to save me financially. However when I started 4 months ago, I was still smoking and started having severe panic attacks being in the reality of it and the thought of the pressures of the job afterwards. 

I quit weed 6 weeks into my bootcamp when i realized that it was making it impossible to remember anything, much less wrap my brain around complicated concepts and functions. 

During the withdrawals, I actually experienced more anxiety when not completely overcome with anhedonia. Questioning my decision to do this bootcamp and seriously debated quitting it. 

I stayed with it, and now, after 2 months of being sober, I feel nervous about my projects and the prospect of a developer job, but no longer any anxiety about it. It‚Äôs such a difference. I also, feel pretty confident in my interactions with people. 

Basically, the anxiety is just gone. Like, non-existent. Nervous and a little scared of an upcoming project and job searching yes, but debilitating anxiety, no. The difference is interesting and a little weird, but certainly welcome. I feel like I got this now. I will be ok. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs my story with anxiety and weed.  It‚Äôs my hope that other leavers will share their‚Äôs so we can help some of the people in the first few days and weeks know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel with anxiety. 

TL/DR: Anxiety has completely become a non issue now that Im sober. Inviting other‚Äôs to share their stories with it.

Edit:  Thank you to everyone who shared. Some really good stories, and great reasons to quit and stay sober!",26

2020-09-03 01:53:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ilnuvp/rock_bottom/,Rock Bottom,"This is my first ever post on reddit and I am glad that it is on this community. 

Today is 3 Sept 2020 and I have hit my rock bottom. I can no longer go on as an addict to this drug. 

My story with weed is perhaps typical to many on this forum. I started smoking during my final years of high school. I stopped briefly after I was caught by my mother but things soon escalated as I entered college. I was smoking daily and everything in my life revolved around getting high. All my closest friends were smokers and I thought that I was living the typical college life. I have always been a high achiever and despite being a massive pothead I managed to graduate university with very good  grades. I kept on justifying to myself my weed use based on the fact that my grades were good and indeed from the outside everything seemed normal. 

However, deep down I knew that I was slowly sinking into an abyss. Emotionally I was becoming hollow. I stopped caring about old friends and friends that didn't smoke weed with me. I only wanted to hang out with my weed smoking friends because only they ""understood the life"" of a stoner. I would lie to my friends and family. I would do anything and everything to get high. It felt like an escape and it felt comfortable. Unknown to me at the time, moral and ethical decay had begun to sunk in. The thick web of lies I maintained to my all those around me weighed on me but it felt worth it. After all, one joint or a fat bong rip later and all those problems were gone again. I could always deal with it later. Everyday was the same - wake up, think about how to get high, get high and then smoke until bed. I was a zombie that had all its life and potential sucked out of it. I kept telling myself that I was happy but in reality I wasn't. I didn't like what I saw in the mirror every morning when I woke up and brushed my teeth sober. After the first joint - Bam - I was back (at least somewhat). I could smile and get through things again. 

This was my life for almost 6 months. I finished university and am waiting to start my masters degree. A few days ago I got caught by my mum. She thought that I had quit long ago and soon realised all the lies that I had fed her. I have a very close relationship with my mother and this really broke her heart. I felt so stupid and angry - how could someone do such degenerate things as I have been doing. I am highly educated and have a good career ahead of me. Yet I am wasting it away on some stupid plant. I know this is my rock bottom and I don't ever want to feel this way again. 

I am determined to quit smoking weed once and for all. I want to live a happy life that is real and vibrant. I want to be the best version of myself. Most importantly, I want to have a honest relationship with my mother going forward. 

I have been reading through other posts on this forum and they have given me lots of hope for the future. This was the first time i have ever posted something online and weirdly i feel better after typing out my thoughts. I hope to report back with good news soon. Thanks!",3

Today has been a little over a week since I stopped smoking/taking edibles and I finally stopped complaining about being tired at work. I am dreaming more now, and sleep comes naturally rather than me drugging myself into a lazy empty dead state.

I am a very active person, and have used weed to motivate myself to do the extra mile so I can smoke and snack. However, I learned that sleep is more than just 8 hours of passing out. Our body uses deep sleep for so much processes such as restoration, memory consolidation, and detoxing the body further. 

With more *restful* sleep, energy levels to do other things have increased as well. I guess the question now is what are we to do with more resources...? Hope y'all do good today :)",10

Since ending my daily smoking habit rather abruptly about three weeks ago, I have encountered anxiety, intense bouts of emotion, and incredibly long nights despite going to bed and falling asleep at the same time. Despite these lousy withdrawal effects, I have managed to get my life in order, so to speak. In other words, I'm doing the things that I am supposed to do, and not ignoring all the things I was using weed to ignore. The absolute clarity is fantastic, as I have managed to reconnect with others   
deeply and finally confront the person inside my head. How quickly it all occurred is kind of surprising, but a good surprise nonetheless.  


While this is all well and good, however I have been working increasingly hard on trying to find meaning in my life. Like I didn't have to worry about how empty life appears to be because I could just be high, and the meaning would be shown to me so that I could appreciate it's splendor. Now, I am coming to understand that suffering is not just something that addicts face after the high, but literally everyone. I understand that the only way to find meaning in my life is to create it, but I kinda feel like I am lying to myself about how meaningful any of my attempts are. I am not even sure what I am trying to say here.  


It's going to be tough, being sober and all. But we all know that we could always make it tougher, and it keeps me staying strong knowing that all of you are also not making your lives tougher by blurring reality and smoking your lives into obscurity.  


Maybe I'll post again soon. Peace.",10

2020-09-02 22:34:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ill2u6/7_days_cleannnnnnn_boopboop/,7 DAYS CLEANNNNNNN BOOPBOOP,"Okay, so this is the longest time I've gone without smoking weed (voluntarily) in about 4-5 years. Before I would only stop if I had too (when I'm in the middle east) and so I didn't really count it because as soon as I got home I would call my dealer and smoke a fat j. 

TBH it wasn't easy and I was looking for any excuse to smoke but when I would try my dealer wouldn't be home and then I'd be too lazy to go when he was back (ironic because I thought weed made me lazy but I guess it's just me!!!). It helped that my friend who doesn't smoke has been staying with me and I've been really busy with my business so its a good distraction. 

I'm not going to lie I haven't seen a major change or difference in the last 7 days apart from the fact that I'm able to read without getting distracted by my brain, I don't overthink as much and my mind is a lot quieter. It's nice. 

I'm still having difficulty sleeping and my friend said I'm more irritable but I don't care. It's nice to be able to be fully present in conversations and not daydream all the time. I used to smoke before most activities as a ""motivator"" but now I just get up and get things done. I even brush my teeth at night now! It's crazy because there are so many things I thought weed enhanced but literally there is no difference if anything life is better without it. 

If you're thinking of quitting I would say don't expect major drastic life-changing differences straight away. Your body will be going through a transition and you need to be patient with it. Also when you experience cravings ask yourself ""why you would like to smoke"" then answer the question. Sometimes the answer is literally ""I'm bored"" or ""I'm used to doing this activity high so muscle memory"". Whatever the answer is, try and find a solution to your problem instead of masking it with weed.

March 2019 I was voluntarily admitted to inpatient for 3 days and didn't smoke obviously there.

I dab multiple times a day and spend an obscene amount of money. I love my pieces, I love my ginder, my enail, my ashtray, my peak, my rituals. When I think of all the ""investments"" I made into my lifestyle I really don't wanna stop.


But I know when I read what is being said here, it is right and I am content but not happy. Nd i have no motivation to change anything. But I'm not fucking happy !!

Looking back, these dispensaries have been just a fancy drug dealer that look like an Apple store inside. They are always busy. Great for them, terrible for an addict.

For example, when I was on day 7 I really wanted to smoke. I would tell myself that I would smoke that Friday.. or that Saturday... Then when that day came, **I realized the craving for what it was: A fleeting emotional state where my problems piled up to the point where I just wanted** ***any escape*** from reality. 

Coming up at 7.5 months sober, I can truly tell you that life is more beautiful on the other side. You can do this. Weed will hold you back in ways that you can't fathom because it's such a slight reduction.

If you're improving at a 1% rate every day for a year: That's (1.01)\^365=\~38. You're 38 times better than you would have been if you were smoking and staying the same. Obviously, those are arbitrary numbers that don't mean anything but the point by enlarge is that things grow at an exponential rate when you make small improvements everyday.

I had to cut off so many friends. I don't talk to two of my best friends anymore. Your experience may vary and that's cool! I just realized that everytime the last three years, our hangouts just involved getting stoned, eating shit food, and watching numbing TV. 

There was a lot of sacrifices I had to make. Don't expect to get it on your first try either, it took me \~10 solid tries of 10+ days of sobriety for me to really nail it. You might have to go through less or more.",17

As for my love life, I still have not came in contact with my ex-girlfriend, I don't think I'll be doing so anymore-- but that's another hill i'm currently climbing, which I plan to conquer. 

As for my job hunt, I got my e-mail today to schedule a phone interview with them, i'm so excited because a little over 2 weeks ago I was stressing over it all to now see the pieces set in place.

- Skin and eyes are clearer 
- No longer reliant on other things such as caffeine to cancel out the weed hangover 
- Self-worth 
- No longer a drama queen. If something happens or breaks I deal with it instead of going into crisis, throwing a tantrum or worse, running away from it
- Sleep is better and in normal amounts now
- Apparently I no longer look tired 24/7 
- Had to learn how to cut my own hair thanks to Covid, stoned me would've just let it become a mess and not give a shit 
- Dreams? Meh. Had nightmares every night until a few weeks ago so 50/50 on this one. Guess it's a free overnight holiday or adventure of I'm being positive about things
- No longer addicted to social media. Let's erm ignore reddit... That's ""educational and therapeutic...""  
- No longer drink can after can of soda. I'm now a hydro homie apparently and boy does my stomach, heart rate and even purse thank me
- I made it this far, why would I ever turn back?

Whenever I lose control and use THC, I find it super hard to break the cycle on the first day. The first day of quitting is always the hardest. So I tried intermittent fasting while trying to quit and it‚Äôs helped me a bunch. I have other methods too but intermittent fasting definitely has the most beneficial effect. I try to fast at least 16hr each time but I‚Äôm striving for longer for maybe better results. There‚Äôs been a lot of studies on intermittent fasting and benefits and the benefits that stood out to me was the ‚Äústarvation‚Äù mode energy. The energy is definitely a real thing, but the feeling is more of a wired feeling than restful energy like when you wake up. I use this energy to keep focused on doing work or getting stuff done, and the constant striving to meet my fasting goal takes the distraction away from cravings. There‚Äôs definitely a correlation between fasting and addiction so just wanted to throw that out there if anyone‚Äôs reading this.

We‚Äôre all in this together",5

This forum has been an essential resource for me in quitting smoking and I just wanted to say thanks to the support system here. The stories and comments in this sub helped give me the push I needed to make my own changes. 

Yesterday marked 4 weeks without lighting up. Previously I hadn‚Äôt had more than a day off in 8 years, and had been smoking dabs and concentrates constantly over the last two years. I am so relieved, excited, and proud to be moving forward to the next chapter of my life. I feel so powerful knowing that weed is no longer holding me back. 

I recently saw a third spine specialist about degenerative L3-L4 discs. At 26 years old, I was using marijuana constantly to escape the pain. My mind felt like pea soup, I was constantly stressed at work, and felt like I was losing myself in a black hole of depression, pain, and negative thoughts. The specialist advised me that surgery would impact my mobility and could even stop me from participating in some of my favorite hobbies (like skiing). After quitting, I‚Äôve found so much more motivation and energy to do cardio (couch to 5k ftw), strengthen my core, and follow my PT exercises. Although I still have a lot of pain, the progress I felt was immediate. I‚Äôve lost ten pounds, developed better focus, and am finally working towards goals my Dr. and I set rather than continue to put them off. 

If you‚Äôre reading this looking for a push, do it! It‚Äôs only been four weeks but this decision has already changed my life for the better. To all of the contributors on this sub, you have my deepest thanks and admiration for helping me find my resolve to quit.",12

* Intermittent and very brief (2-3 seconds and then gone) but piercing headaches 
* Random body pains? Similar to the headaches, piercing pain but very brief. They've been all over, including in my chest, but not necessarily corresponding to my breathing/laughing etc. 
* SLIGHTLY sore throat, only a little bit red 
* SLIGHT but persistent congestion - it feels like there's a blob of something in my sinuses that I can't get out. I've used a netti pot twice and both times while my nose was cleared (it hasn't been that stuffy), there was still this yucky blob feeling above the roof of my mouth if that makes sense 
* No persistent cough, but I have been periodically coughing up mucous with black/brown specks in it. After inspecting I am preeetty sure it's not blood, but it could be. I've been assured by the internet that this is normal and not something I should be super concerned about, and have let my doctor know who said to just monitor it and let him know if I start coughing up blood ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* Anxiety has been pretty bad, at some point every day (usually several times a day) my brain starts telling me I am probably going to die from COVID, or a heart attack or a stroke. I start to focus more on sensations in my body and ascribing more meaning to them than probably warranted. As soon as I am focused on something else though I feel better

Some good things I've been experiencing:

*  I exercised yesterday for the first time in probably a few months! It felt great. 
* My sleep has actually been pretty good. It takes me a little while to fall asleep, but when I do I get a good amount in. For the first time, my husband and I have actually been consistently limiting screen time before bed and reading George R.R. Martin stories instead, which has also been some pretty interesting fuel for the weird/vivid dreams 
* I am consistently losing weight but not too quickly, and in a way that feels sustainable - probably due to not binging anymore, but still, it is nice. 

It has been so helpful to see other people's updates on how they are doing, so I hope this helps someone. I hope you are all staying well and thank you for being awesome! Good luck, and remember, wherever you are in this journey, all that matters is you are here and you are trying your best. We can do this!",11

I am starting to feel really bad about myself, feeling like I've been so dumb to relapse after more than a year sober (relapse lasted approx 1/2 year), I am angry at myself and I am sad too. I wasted the last 6 months when I could've made a lot of progress to reach my goals. While I was sober I managed to fix some relationships that went bad because of my smoking habit and my behaviour, I feel like I have to do this all over again. I feel guilty for not contacting my grandmother for over 2 months and I am not doing it at the moment because I am so irritable and sad, I don't want her to see/hear me like this. I get cravings when my thoughts are too loud in my head.

I am at my mum's on holiday and she doesn't know about the whole situation, I told her I feel tired because pressure from work is leaving and that's why I need to rest a lot and take it easy. 

I seem to fall asleep a lot easier than at the start, I get weird dreams but not nightmares and I tend to forget what they were about in the first minute I'm awake. I am eating again though not a lot.

I feel a bit helpless and hopeless, having no sentimental relationship, no proper job (a few things here and there), living in a tiny room with shared bathroom, I feel like I have nothing !

During the last few days I did a lot of gardening, it keeps my mind busy but as soon as I stop my thoughts come back and the sadness/anger comes back. 

It's hard for me to organise my thoughts at the moment as you can see, all over the place, I'm sorry if it's hard to read and I hope some of you will read it because I found great support on here everytime I posted.

I picked up a friend for a lunch date and had to use her toilet , iv been staying away from her house because we always smoked there. I walked past her laundry and the bong was on the washing machine, it was so dirty and smelt so bad. The top of the washing machine was caked with resin stains and weed crumbs and I couldn't help but think how dirty that room is considering it's meant to be where all the cleaning happens.

On the way out she had to grab her bag which is where her partner put the weed they'd just picked up and she passed it to me to show how much she had gotten.It was such a tiny amount for $90. With COVID drugs are harder to find so the price has gone up. I'm so glad I don't have to worry about the hunt anymore.

It wasn't until I got into the car it hit me that I just held weed and wasn't bothered !",7
2020-09-01 20:51:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ikwuhu/i_need_to_quit/,I need to quit,"I want nothing more than to quit. But I can‚Äôt. If I quit, I lose a piece of myself. But how much more can I lose if I have been lost for years. At first the feeling was an escape. An escape from the loneliness. A distraction from my pain and insecurities. My only friend when no one else was around. 

I need to quit. The cost of admission for this escape was not worth the help it gave me at first. For looking back, it didn‚Äôt help me at all. It distracted me. Distracted me from my ambitions and desires that I felt too weak to pursue. But during all that time that I was traveling to new heights, I was being left behind. Missing out on experiences, missing out on the opportunity to chase my goals. Only to return to earth to realize I‚Äôm exactly where I was. Just a little older and a little bit more anxious after each time.

And now here I am. In college, alone. A constant headache. Constantly on edge. My only relief from this pain being the breaks I take from my once friend. But this friend never leaves my side, always finding a way into my life, or into the top drawer of my dresser. This friend has become quite popular among the people in my life. This friend used to help me open up, supporting me and giving me confidence. But now it feels like it takes more from me than it ever gave. 

This friend took my confidence, my piece of mind and my happiness. But it is often a device for bonding. While some turn to the bottle to bond, the people in my life turn to the bong. But when you have used a bong as much as I, the feeling it gives is no longer a high. It is a low. It creates tension, anxiety, fear. Takes the words right out of your mouth. Drains the power from your precious brain. You forget what you want. Start overthinking the simple things in your life. 

I have become but a tiny man in the shell of a once confident man. A tiny man who cannot tell others how he feels. A tiny man who has been rejected and hurt by women too many times that he has lost hope. He no longer cares to talk to women for he fears the pain he knows too well. These women have been replaced by a screen. Shame fills him. He knows better. He knows that real love is better than any drug he could ever smoke, more powerful than any pain he could ever feel. But he has forgotten how to love. For he has his friend. And with his friend he is never alone, he has his thoughts.

But this friend is no friend at all. He controls me. Controls my thoughts. Controls and restricts my actions. Stops me from pursuing the girl. Stops me from going out to meet people and make friends. And even if I say no to this friend, he is likely to still show up. For while this friend has become my enemy, most of my friends have just met him. Oblivious to the harm this friend can cause. Oh how I pray for them. Because as I have been driven to the edge by my pain, it is only now that I finally realize who my friend has been this whole time. I have befriended the Devil. I have befriended him in the form of smoke, powders and tabs of paper. He comes in many forms. But if you ask for his help too many times, you will often find that he has taken more than he has given. 

Unfortunately for me this knowledge has come too late for I fear there is no going back. My head is too full of anxiety and depression that I fear it will never truly be gone. I fear that the only time I will not feel this pain anymore is when I meet God and apologize for what I have done. I only hope my family and friends will be able forgive me. For I am at the end of the road. 

But I am not without hope. For I know that at the end of every dark tunnel, no matter how dark, there is a light. It is just up to me to figure out how to get there. For I no longer crave the help of my friend. I will replace him with new less selfish friends that could never take as much as he has. For I am strong. Maybe not today, but overall, I am strong. I can get through this.",3

I agreed and honestly I had been feeling that I needed to stop using it the way I was. It was something I used to cope with anxiety and made me feel safe. 

Two weeks without and I feel worse than ever, I don‚Äôt seem to be happy without distracting myself. The problem is; I can‚Äôt seem to just sit and enjoy myself. The need to be distracted is really getting in the way of my relationship because I just fall back into being depressed or anxious.

I don‚Äôt feel the urge to smoke, I want to keep it at bay but I miss being able to have fun with regular life.

I can tell this is really frustrating my partner because she assumed that quitting would have be a solution to the way I felt a lot of the time and the fact that I‚Äôm not emotionally available is damaging our relationship.

A little backstory, I'm 19 and live in a country where the only marijuana related product you can buy is hash, it's illegal but it's extremely cheap and easy to get. It's also pretty great stuff, cheap too, at something like 3$ for 5 grams of potent Afghan hash it's usually a pretty great deal. 

I started smoking up back when I was like 15, I wasn't a daily user and my reasons for smoking were probably different from alot of people. I wasn't the most social person and wanted a larger social circle, my most well connected (not sure if that's the right word) friends were stoners and I knew stoners meet stoners so why not?
Well it actually worked out, my social circle grew, I maintained top tier grades and the world was just more fun.  Four years later, my grades are still great, my social life is flourishing like never before and I'm somewhat of a leader among my group of stoner friends.

I've noticed that most people in this subreddit quit for various reasons like anxiety, lethargy, a lack of drive etc but realistically I'd say I don't actually deal with any of these problems. The last year if my life was probably the happiest of my life, due to the people I spent it with and the memories we made - without hash that wouldn't have happened. Sure, something else great may have happened, I'm not saying this fun was solely the result of drugs but it did contribute. Hash made me less aggressive, a more easy going person and probably most importantly it pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to go socialize with new people.

Fast forward to Corona and that's when I'd say I sort of went off the deep end, I was smoking anywhere between 5-10 grams a day for a few months and overall probably blew through more than 600 grams of hash. The respect you get from stoners when you can out smoke the whole group alone is a crazy sort of ego boost that I loved. I was high all day with the excuse that I'm stuck at home, there's nothing else to do. I was probably smoking 6-12 joints a day. 

Anyways, long story short my parents found a brick of hash in my room (100g+) and things have got to change if I want peace in my life and home.  Overall I'd say my experience with hash was good, I enjoyed it and in retrospect I'd probably do it again just even more sneakily. I'll miss it, I'll miss meeting my friends for abit since I know if I go right now, I'll smoke. I'll miss Rolling joints, that was probably my real hobby, there's just something so satisfying about rolling a great J and knowing everybody who smokes it will agree. I loved rolling crosses, spirals, layering hash over a J etc, it was like an art form and damn, I dedicated a long time to getting good at it. 

If the first semester if university wasn't online maybe I wouldn't take a break, but it is what it is and if I'm stuck at home till December I can't be getting high. I'm sorry if this post was a bit haphazard, or if the English wasn't great - it isn't my first language. Really, I guess what I want to say is I really wish I was quitting in my own terms, there's something about quitting something I don't even think is wrong that makes bit so much harder. So many of you have your own motivations for quitting, how it would improve your performance in all aspects of life. For me it's just something that I enjoyed.

And yes before people tell me 600+ grams isn't enjoying, I hope you get what I mean because even I know that's a copious amount.",4

2020-09-01 18:10:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iku5av/i_smoked_again_for_like_a_month_and_a_few_weeks/,I smoked AGAIN for like a month and a few weeks. Heres what I learned.,"This will be pretty long, But I have a story that could maybe help someone .I have smoked since I was 14 years old . Now I am 21. That is 7 years of me smoking. Keep in mind though, that I did take breaks in between. 

All my life I had a really easy life. My parents did everything for me, BUT I think that‚Äôs where I got confident.

So since I thought I had everything, I thought trying weed wouldn‚Äôt hurt. First times getting high are amazing, everything is so euphoric, that it makes you want to smoke before EVERYTHING. 

When I started smoking weed, I also adopted other bad habits. Wanting to try other substances, drinking alcohol, and doin stuff like dat.. one of the things I realized now, is that I was very insecure basically my whole life, which lead to me starting smokin. 

Which developed an addiction I didn‚Äôt know I had. Fast forward to 2018, I had to stop smoking weed because I was always bloated. I thought having the munchies, smoking weed was the way honestly. Until I started having bad trips, and having nausea everytime I smoked. To the point where it was unbearable. This is called CHS, Cannabinoid Hypremesis. 

I had the guts to stop, which lead me to loose stools, hightened anxiety and I dont even remember what else LOL. 

At some point, I got diagnosed with IBS, but now that I think about it, it could be because of all my habits, including smoking weed because of how bad I ate, I ate soo much, and late at night. When you are stoned you do many bad habits that you do not realize what you are doing to your body until later.

I took a month break in July, and I was feeling GREAT. No more fog mind, anxiety, and all the good stuff. 

I thought to myself that maybe I could smoke more in August, but I stopped yesterday because of current situations. And ONCE AGAIN im realizing how dumb I am, on why I keep smoking weed. 

I became lazy, depressed, anxious. Because of my IBS. And not having done anything much in my life of age 21. 

I have lost jobs, and other things because of weed, and other reasons.

Everyone in high school had fun, playing sports, w no worries. Meanwhile I had crippling anxiety, with huge insecurity issues. 

Now, This probably seems exaggerated. But it all starts with Marijuana, Im sure if I would have joined sports in middle school, or even stayed in Marching band(snareline) I would have had better days now. This everyday is my motivation to stop. But
Eventually I reach a point where im sober and a blunt doesn‚Äôt seem to bad, and then that blunt turns into 5. 

So my point is, let go of the weed. When your body tells you enough, listen to it! And stay true to yourself, nobody knows you more than yourself, and stop being a wuus and let go of bad habits. Who cares what anyone has to say. Even if you have no support . You have mine. And it‚Äôs kinda crazy to realize that all my problems, where caused cause of me, and I never took action, even though I knew I needed to, but the deepersonalization makes it hard to think clearly.  Are you willing to give up a few hours, of feel good. Rather than putting in work now, to have a better future? Idk you tell me :)

This is again not smokin again, Lets do this .

Instead of smoking weed, find other hobbies. Mine is working out. I love the adrenaline it creates. Just learn to love yourself again. 
LET THE COLOR COME BACK. Let the prizes, be the reasons for your smiles. Be the precious one you were, before you decided to dull your life w smoke.",150

I feel happy :)) I'd love to give some advice for those trying to get whatever hill they're trying to conquer right now,"Yesterday sucked after I was stuck inside all day with nothing to do. All I could think about was how it would've been nice to just spark up since I wasn't doing anything. I ended up going on tik tok for over 5 hours, I sometimes feel like I'm replacing this with phone addiction tbh which is something I gotta work on. Other than that, here's to a month!

Anyways, if I could give some advice's that's helped me:

- Every time I wanted to smoke I went out for a quick walk around the block, threw on my headphones, and listened to some music or a podcast. My favorite this month was the Dissect podcast! The first season's on Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and there were a few times where I was brought to tears when I realized how beautiful the world can really be. The ending with listeners sharing their personal experiences with the album really got to me because it made me realize we're all just fans of music who connect to albums in our own special way. That's art to me.

- Whenever I wanted to smoke, I asked myself *why* I'd be turning to smoking at that moment. Just bored, wanted food to taste better, depressed? Figure out the root of the problem and try to improve the root. 

- I've been treating myself to eat out a little more because I'm not spending so much on weed. It helps break apart the days and lets me relax a little more not having to worry about cooking.

- I keep track of the money I would've spent on weed so I can treat myself. I got to one month, so I think I wanna treat myself to finally get that game I had my eye on (Ghost of Tsushima, lmk if anyone's played it!)

- Going on drives and throwing on some music just focusing on my feelings and figuring out what I'm thinking, being alone in the car has really helped.

- Writing in my journal, even when I don't feel like I have anything to write about. Something always ends up being spilled out onto the page. Just start writing about how you started your day it's pretty easy.

- Also in my journal, once a week I write down all the songs I've been listening to. I like to highlight them with different the colors that I associate the songs with. It's a nice way to keep track of your time and feelings.

- When I'm at my weakest, I come to this sub and respond to a few posts, especially the posts that need more attention or I feel like I can offer a bit of advice to. It always always always puts into perspective what I'm fighting for

That's all I got for now, I'm proud of how far I've come. If anyone feels like anything's resonated please feel free to reach out to me if you wanna talk some more. It's a tough battle and man I've felt depressed a lot of the time, but day 31 feels a lot different from day 30 I can attest to that. These little goals are great to aim for :)

None of that would have been possible if I had still been stuck in my old ways.

It's nice that my life is moving forward and changing. I spent too many years withdrawn from the world, going nowhere with myself, and not changing as a person. I think quitting marijuana was the first step towards making those things possible for me to deal with.

Good morning ‚òÄÔ∏è 
 Today is day 2 after 20 plus years of heavy smoking.  Yesterday I threw away 90% of my paraphernalia but kept a glass pipe and papers just in case I felt I needed to smoke. Kind of like the other person in the group said, they're choosing not to smoke. I to am choosing to make a choice to change. Yesterday was pretty wicked and I did go buy a mmj Cartridge to take the edge off slightly.  It's not nearly the same but  It did take the edge off. I told myself you can only use the cartridge for one week not more than 2 if i am  really hurting.  Currently I'm on 52 days sober from vodka and I don't want to mess that up.  I think reporting in here each day will be very helpful to my journey of change.  This group is a real inspiration to keep going. I love reading your stories because we can relate to them and it helps us change. OK bring on day 2. The worst part I think is my mind is just so freakin awake and I already am a busy body so it's like I'm on steroids geeze!",5

I started selling weed when I met a guy, who is still one of my best friends even though we've grown apart, around the age of 19/20. He told me ""why not smoke for free"" and that's how it all started. I started with a $110 ounce of mid and ended up smoking for free, having gas & food money, and ended up only spending $10 of my own money that entire week. This was great - all this and it was like it only cost me $10 for an entire week. I could do this full time! Gradually, I moved up from there. My friend, who I just mentioned, got our first apartment together and we started selling weed while having small part time jobs that meant nothing to us. He was the guy that introduced me into ""hustling."" I was always a small time mid dealer, who didn't have a full time job up until I was 26 and went without a job and just selling weed for a solid three years. I ended up being force to quit when the local drug enforcement agency ran in on me while me and my ex-wife (girlfriend at the time and she was 6 months pregnant) were living at her father's house while he was out of the country working for two years. I quit smoking and selling and got a job at RadioShack. I didn't smoke for a year and a half and didn't sale weed for like 3 years. Well, between being broke all the time and being in a horrible relationship where we were always arguing, especially over money. I started selling again when my co-worker at a new job knew some mutual friends of mine who vouched for me. This was 2011 - I started back. Life still wasn't great, we argued still and we had an ugly ugly divorce. Well, it is now 2020 and I am 35 years old and I still sell weed. I hate it. For the first time in my life, I am finacial stable somewhat, I have more money saved up than I ever have, and I have reached my first two financial goals - that I set when I was younger. Problem is, I hate my life. I quit my job for another job about a year and half ago and the job ended up being a lie and not what I was promised so I quit that one. Not a big deal, I'll find another one I thought. Financially, my money really hasn't decreased or increased in the past year. I just maintain the same amount saved up while being able to spend and pay bills. All I do is sit at the house and wait for people to call me for weed. I smoke quite a bit and I feel it makes me really unmotivated. When I didn't smoke during my divorce, I was going out, meeting new people, and always active. Now, I just sit at home and smoke and do nothing or when I go out to do things, I smoke and think to myself ""I rather be at home."" I don't know what to do. I want to quit selling but if I do right now then what will I do for income? Get a job, I know, but the income won't be as great as selling weed (even though I'm small time I still make around a few hundred to a thousans a week in profit). I'm 35. Have a low paying job I hate. My only real income is selling weed. I want to quit but its like I can't. My other problem is I feel like I abuse smoking weed too. Being sober and not high is like a foreign feeling to me now. I try to go without smoking and by 2PM I feel like crap and then I go hit a bowl and then I'm back to feeling physically better but emotionally worse. I'm always so lethargic and unmotivated. I want to go back to being me, immersing myself in culture and life but I smoke and that all goes out the window and I just want to lay around and watch shows and play video games. My justification i tell myself is that weed enhances the movies I see and books I read. I've become too lazy to read anymore. Inside I'm miserable. Every time I smoke all I think is self depreciating thoughts about how I wasted my intelligence and potential the past years smoking and selling instead of making headway on my life. When im high i just think about how i need to quit. Smoking is great, in moderation, but I abuse it and I can't shake it. I want to quit but then I sell it for income and I see it all the time.
I'm lost and don't know what to do to start my life. I watch shows and just compare myself to them (I know its very unrealistic to do this) and I get even more depressed. Any help and advice will be greatly appreciated. I apologize for rambling on about this",5

Im on day 2 of not smoking weed. Im having a lot of urges to smoke right now. 

When i got the urges like 1 hour ago, I imiditaly asked myself: Why do i want to smoke?, Is it gonna benefit me in anyway? The awnser i gave was: No, its not gonna help you and when you are high you wished you didnt smoke. 

Its weird that I dont want to smoke but something in my mind wants to smoke.

Anyone can relate?

I hope you all are having a nice sober day!",3

2020-09-01 09:41:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ikkg7n/day_3_its_hard_but_im_overcoming_my_fears/,"Day 3, it's hard but I'm overcoming my fears","Partly what kept me smoking was the fact that I knew that I would have hard time falling asleep or sleeping well when I quit. I've been afraid of losing sleep, but post-poning quitting by smoking just makes it worse obviously lol. Last night it took me about 3 hours, which is annoying.

Today (not sure if it was the night's sleep) I've had a little headache and my brainfog feels worse than yesterday for some reason. We had a person come to our workplace and give talk about interaction, and she was talking and asking questions. At some points I felt like I literally forgot what she said a few seconds ago, trying my hardest to concentrate, but my thoughts would wonder elsewhere to some other stressful situation. Has anyone else noticed this when quitting? Though I cannot be sure if my brainfog is actually worse than the 2 days prior or not.

I do feel bit worse physically today, but I don't really crave smoking. I have little thoughts here and there, but I know smoking would not help me at all. Maybe it would veil my situation for a little bit, but it would be painful to return from toking and starting again. It probably would not feel much different then, and could be worse actually. I'm already on day 3, which seems small, but feels like it's been a while already, and I don't want to stop now.

I keep exercising and meditating, in general life is good, although I'm a bit out of it still and irritated to some degree. I do notice my emotions coming back which is great! Yesterday I got moved by listening to music and that felt good :). I also am proud of myself for going through this. I'm loving myself even though I don't feel at my best. I've no regrets for being sober for the days that have passed, in fact psychologically I'm already feeling better, because I'm not acting in a self defeating manner or deceit right now. I feel more confident already, and less dreadful.

Thanks for all the great posts, your success makes me happy. I'm glad we are progressing as a community toward a happier and more fulfilling life. Thank you for being here and supporting each other.

For you who are sobering up now: give yourself some slack for feeling the way you do. Your physiology and psychology may be out of balance right now. It's okay to feel not okay, no need to run anywhere, no need to avoid or hide the feelings. Accept yourself the way you are, because you are doing the best you can, and your body is doing its best too :) Thanks for being here.",3

Honestly it wasn't terrible like many people have said they experienced. I like the idea of being able to control it and just have it on the odd occasion. My whole problem before was how it took over my life and I'm past that. However it wasn't great and I certainly felt that old need to keep the high going throughout the night. The next day I felt lethargic and shitty though. I really wanted some more just to take the edge off the weedover. I didn't cave to it and I'm proud that I've got over that dependency. 

This morning though was shitty. 2 days later and I was feeling the old anxiety I used to get waking up for work. Back then work was stressful and I blamed that anxiety on the work. My job now is chill and there was no reason to feel apprehensive about work. I now realise just how much it was impacting my emotional state. Of course today I got up and went to work regardless of how I was feeling. A few months ago I might have called in sick and spent the day smoking.

A bit of a ramble but I suppose I just wanted to share how much it was impacting my emotional well-being and maybe it's impacting you that way too.  If so reflect on that and, if you're still smoking, if it's really worth waking up dreading every day.",15

I've been really productive most days the last few weeks but it's going to take a couple of months to get it sorted as we moved last year and need to sell a bunch of stuff etc. We haven't done half the DIY projects we wanted to this year and now Autumn is on its way.

I want to spend some time on self care like read another book (read one for the first time this year while I was withdrawing) and exercise but if I do that, I'll be behind on everything and still be stressed.

My friend is clearly lonely at the moment and is suggesting socials and that's stressing me out because I haven't got time for that as I've wasted so much of it this year and want to see my sober friends that I've neglected if I see anyone. I've seen her a bunch this year and she doesn't seem to understand that I'm behind on everything. Going to have to just be firm and reassure her but playing that conversation out in my head is just reinforcing the time pressures going on.

I really didn't have time to be getting high all the time this year. I'm still riding out the consequences of my actions but I'm having to deal with it sober and I'm becoming aware of the feeling that everything is a chore and I just want to have the space to walk along the beach, read a book or do some exercise but I can't right now because I've squandered my time.

I've just got to be a big girl and deal with it but it's a rubbish part of becoming sober - caring about your life needs! It will bear fruit in the end but it's a shame I can't relax a bit more except for depression days but that doesn't count.

I'm sure plenty of you have been here in this stage of recovery so I thought I'd have a wee rant at you guys. The good thing is I'm in touch with my life needs and feeling motivated to meet them but it's all feeling ever so sober right now. Still not tempted to going back  to weed. Even with everything I just said, my reality is still better without it. Thanks for listening. Rant over.",7

I smoked once at 16. Didn't do it again until I was 18. Then I never stopped and have smoked every day for years. The longest I've gone without smoking is 3 months 2 years into my wake and bake life and it wasn't by choice. I don't know what to do. I've tried to stop but the next day I always find a way to smoke up. What do I do? My therapist believes I need to be sober and suggested 12step. I'm not sure at times. Smoking gets in the way of a lot now. It's not that enjoyable either. But I can't function without it. I don't feel joy or pleasure or success without it. I feel ""pain"" and am highly irritable. I also vape nicotine and still hitting that makes it hard to not want to smoke weed. But quitting both at the same time failed a lot too. Makes all the withdrawls worse. I'm scared of life being worthless without weed or other drugs. I don't stop at nicotine or weed and do a lot of other drugs as well. I feel like weed is the least harmful, so why give it up? Why give up my bit of relief? Addiction runs in the family too with alcohol, meth, and heroin between two siblings as well as a host of mental health stuff that I've inherited. I need any help and advice you guys got. I do want to get better but my head is a mess and I don't know where to start or how to keep it up. I managed to see a therapist and go back to school.
