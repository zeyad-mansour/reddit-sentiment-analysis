I decided to stop as i lost control of everything in my life.I had no issues quitting and still smoked small amounts with friends and was fine. i am now 19 and Have been smoking a handful of times over the last few weeks and i am really enjoying it and it is helping me deal with emotions rather than suppressing them. I want to keep it on a weekly basis and feel it could benefit me but i am still wondering if this could be a mistake.,5

I've been with my partner for nearly 12 years. We have smoked weed on a daily basis for that whole time. I have always been uncomfortable with it but always joined in with gusto.

I found some texts to another fella on her phone basically sexting each other. They never met in person and she ended it after 3 weeks of Intense sexual messaging. 

We have a 3 year old and a 5 year old. 

I lost my shit initially but actually, since then I've taken a long hard look at us and myself and realise that weed is 99% to blame. 

It makes me lazy, un talkative, non creative, untidy etc etc. I have been a shadow of the man iam and I'm ashamed of my addiction. 

She has been smoking weed for 20 years and cannot really see the problem worryingly. 

I've told her, in agreement with our therapist that it's our family or weed. 

Here's to the new brave frontier. 

26 hours clean. 

This sub has been a great help. 

Thanks all",134

Today is one year when I am sober and haven't smoke any marijuana. I am so proud of myself and I am so happy that I found this subreddit. Understanding that there are thousands of people who has similar story gave me so much power.

My life is so much different now. One year ago I was miserable and pathetic guy who was poor, but still could spend all his money to buy weed. I didn't believe in myself and I was such a pussy. 

Now I am super happy, my memory is surprising. I have this life drive which I always wanted. I am super successful in my career and earn so much money I can afford anything. I never believed that this is possible. 

I think that my addiction is over. I know that I can't smoke NEVER. Had a lot of opportunities this year, even rolled joints for my friends but never even thought that I could take a hit. I just made peace with that and it fucking worked. I will smoke when I am 70 and sitting in the garden in my dream home, just when my whole life will be completed. 

So just wanted to tell someone who is where I was. No matter if you smoke 5g a day for 10 years. You can do it. Just imagine your life that it can be amazing. Someone up there will take care of you. Just believe and do it.

It's not hard as you think. It's surprising easy :)",160

I didn’t even enjoy it anymore. I feel similarly with weed, but like the title says I am struggling to commit to the idea of never smoking it again. My brain keeps telling me that sure, even if it’s bad for you right now, it might not always be - and I haven’t even made it three days in a row yet so I don’t know where this panic is really coming from. 

Someone made a post the other day about weed being our binky, and I can definitely relate. I’m like the toddler who can rationalize a day or two without it because we’re on vacation, but my brain just can’t comprehend why I should have to give it up when it’s easily accessible, perfectly legal, and even arguably positive in some ways. 

Yet deep down in my heart of hearts I know I need to stop if for no other reason than this exact struggle. I’m not in control anymore and I think that’s what I’m missing. There was a point where choosing to smoke weed was an (albeit misguided) “expression of my free will” but those days are long gone. Sometimes I have a hoot before I even remember it was supposed to be a sober day and that is not okay. 

I read something someone else wrote  (here as well I think) about using the word finished instead of quit, because the latter implies giving something up whereas “finished” is more like moving on from something. I like this idea and I truly want to be finished with being a functional stoner. Who knows what I could get done if operating at full capacity? I certainly don’t anymore. 

As always, I’m full of promises at the end of the day, but it is my intention to start 2022 already sober. So here is to being finished with weed and a final day one starting tomorrow (December 31). Anyone else in?",6

I caved in tonight. Have been smoking weed since high school, practically daily for 10 years, so it is so ingrained in my routine. Last years i didn't smoke alot, just one joint a days, but i had to have that. It did became almost a ritual that i needed. 

I have been trying to shake the habit by only buying prerolled joints on the moments i needed It, so Every Day. Made it a lot more expensive but also harder to get my daily fix. If the coffeeshop was closed ( I'm dutch so I simply can go to a shop that usually only closes around midnight), or if I was unable to go, i had one Victorious night. It always felt like a victory when i didn't smoke a night.

Tonight was different. I didn't realize that the shops where closing earlier because of covid regulations and the Christmas break. I was stalling at home but finally i jumped on my bike and i was racing to get to the shop on time. I could not help it anymore. I was defeated by myself. I arrived before regular closing time but the shops were already closed.

Now i am back at home, feeling relieved and angry, anxious and happy. I am so conflicted. I want to stay sober because weed is affecting my sleep, my mood, my work and my marriage, but i still want it so badly. Both feelings are equally strong.

I am currently sitting next to my TV watching bulshit on youtube, and just thinking one thing: how could I have smoked for 13 years everyday. How could I think that I could function living like this, just mentally challenged everyday by choice. Working high, meeting friends high, talking to family high, trying to finally start dating again high. And I actually though that it's not because of weed life is so difficult and weird, it's supposed to help you relax and unwind right? Paranoia is back full force too, the fucking anxiety to the point that I would not leave the house for anything right now.

Had things to do today as well, was supposed to move to my place from friends place. Prepare for tommorow as I have some friends over for new years. Talk to my mum. Go sleep early since I work like shit for the past few days, not doing the bare minimum. 

The only thing it did, it made me not care as much. That's it, I didn't even forget my problems, I just care a little less about them, which is just a disaster in the long run.

We are doing this to ourselves guys. We are purposely sedating ourselves, and numbing our emotions. This will not work, it cannot.

I have no trouble falling asleep but I wake up multiple times every night, and even if I get 10+ hours I feel exhausted when I wake up.","I was a daily smoker for about 6 years, from age 19 to 25. I quit about a week ago because I learned that I'm allergic to marijuana. I haven't had any noticeable withdrawal symptoms except that I feel exhausted no matter how much I sleep, I've been having vivid dreams, and I wake up multiple times a night (before and during my marijuana use I slept like a rock). Since quitting I've been sleeping for 7-11 hours every night and it doesn't make any difference, I always wake up tired with huge bags under my eyes. The worst part is my eyes honestly. They burn when I keep them open to the point where I feel like I need to shut them, even when driving. 

I was worried that I have sleep apnea that was somehow masked by my marijuana use, since I wake up with a dry mouth feeling lightheaded, but I've been recording myself sleeping and having family members check on me and I'm not snoring or choking in my sleep. I asked my doctor to see a sleep specialist but they can't see me for 3 FUCKING MONTHS. 

Assuming it isn't sleep apnea, is it possible that it's from marijuana withdrawal? If so how long can I expect to wait until I start sleeping well again? I feel like shit every day, no energy, taking naps, and sometimes I need to pull over when driving because I'm so tired.",4

Prior to the holiday break I had been eating very clean (former junk food junkie). I ""broke down"" over the last two weeks and ate a lot of fast food, sugary stuff, etc, etc. Today when I woke up I said no more, and am now returning to my previous healthier relationship with food. 

I was thinking about how every one of those times I ordered fast food, ate some chips or candy that it really wasn't that isolated incident that was the problem. It was the accumulation of daily bad habits that cause the problems. 

It was the same with weed - using weed once here and there is, imo, no cause for concern. It's the daily use, multiple times a day where I was running into trouble. Exact same scenario as it is/was with food for me recently.

It really is about the choices you make each day, what you decide to put in your body or mind that changes the outcome of your life. Before, when I was a weed and junk food addict I never understood the consequence of those ""small"" decisions. Making the choice to use weed each day is exactly why I was an addict.

It's an obvious observation but one I just didn't really think a lot about. On the day, at the exact time you are making that choice it doesn't seem like a big deal but how you use your time and the choices you make really does have a huge impact on your life.",8

As you know quitting weed allows you to dream again. I read online that dreams are kind of indicators from our waking lives and people even reported improving themselves by listening their dreams. Knowing this I always googled what my dreams meant and they usually told me a few interesting, useful things about myself. Recently however one dream I had was extremely helpful.

In my dream I was hurting someone and wanted to kill them but didn't end up killing them. Disturbed, I googled my dream which said I had feelings of repressed anger. I researched repressed anger and found it occurs when you intentionally avoid feeling hurt. I’ve been depressed lately and I always knew I wasn’t feeling my emotions enough but reading several articles about avoiding hurt feelings really helped me self-identify my plight and why i was depressed.

Ive been forcing myself to feel hurt lately and while it’s sucks I also feel so much better emotionally and mentally. Had I not quit weed and listened to my dreams and connected the dots, i would still be depressed and possibly even worse. I’ve got a lot more feeling to do but I feel better and more importantly i will continue to feel my feelings out of depression.

If you’ve quit weed, try googling your dreams and you may find useful, personalized insight about your waking life. 

If you’re considering quitting now you have another reason to.

TL DR: quit smoking weed and started dreaming as result, googled what my dreams meant, one nightmare told me I had repressed anger, discovered repressed anger was due to avoiding hurt feelings (which was something I did alot), have now been feeling my hurt feelings and now feel better and will continue to do so.

Stay sober, be safe & healthy, and sweet dreams!",7
2021-12-30 16:26:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rscodr/weed_and_shame/,Weed and Shame,"I’m coming up on a year sober. I quit when I was 25 after smoking daily for 5 years. 

For most of that time I was really ashamed of my weed use - hiding it from my family and friends, smoking alone, and ruminating on how weed was ruining my brain and my life. I felt so much shame and I hated myself. I thought I was a bad person. 

Then about 7 months before I quit, I started seeing a therapist who encouraged me to get in touch with the different “parts” of myself. She didn’t encourage me to quit weed but instead to reflect on what the “high” part of me was doing to protect me. I started to think about myself in college: going through bad relationships, trying my best in school but being depressed and anxious. Weed got me through those times. I began to appreciate the part of me that sought out weed, and to love that part because it was trying it’s very very best to protect me from pain. 

When I felt compassion for “high me”, my perspective changed from shame to self love and growth. I realized that I had grown and taken care of myself even when I was smoking - that my life wasn’t totally wasted and that I was doing the best I could to take care of myself at that time. 

It took time - over 6 months - but at a certain point I realized I was NOT a bad person for smoking weed.  I began to think about what I wanted from life- a healthy marriage, to be able to cook for myself, and to not feel anxious every day. I felt ready to do something that my gut told me would help me reach my goals - quit.  I did this out of love for myself, not to prove that I was a good person.

Working to treat myself with love and understanding has not solved cravings and didn’t make quitting a walk in the park. But it gave me the determination to continue on the path long enough to see the benefits.

I wanted to post this for people who come to this subreddit but maybe aren’t ready to quit yet. That’s okay. It took me many tries. It is completely possible. And there is work you can do to treat yourself with love and understanding, while you are still smoking.

Much love to everyone! This community has helped me so much.",176

I’ve been working on this for a few weeks through journaling and making a list of reasons I smoke and why I want to quit (made it 2 1/2 weeks weed-free, picked up again for 5 days, and now I’m back on day 3 weed-free). The reason I picked up again was because I had a headache and had not yet researched weed’s effectiveness for getting rid of headaches, so I rationalized to myself that I could take a hit, wait 15 minutes and see how I felt. I ended up exercising after that and the headache did go away, but unsure if it was because of the weed or the workout. Later that night I took one more hit for “fun” (which was not part of the research 😬) and that turned in to a slippery slope for the next 5 days. I remember another day I took a hit and it actually seemed to give me a headache? Conflicting data, but overall not worth the negative side effects of smoking (laziness, binge eating, dissociating, anti-social behavior) for questionable headache relief (I’ll stick with exercise or water).

Was it worth the 5 day slip to learn this lesson? Yes, if I do actually learn from it. So I journaled to give me something to refer back to when I think a hit will help my headache again in the future. Do I regret the 5 day slip? Sure, I don’t like that I ate a bunch of junk food and felt sick and bloated. But I’m not going to withhold self-compassion in this experiment. I’m proud that I am looking deeper into my relationship with weed and questioning it’s place in my life.

Over the last few days, I have begun [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19365990-the-joy-of-quitting-cannabis) more and more about how marijuana addiction works, and have started to recognize that I don't actually enjoy using it - the drug is just good at *tricking* me into thinking that I enjoy it. 

So last night, I decided to have my final sesh and dump out the rest of my weed. I'm sick of smoking and being high and I'm not waiting the couple of days until the new year. There is no time like the present to quit, right?

Anyways, I decided to make a post on here so I could have something to come back to - I expect that at some points on this journey I will be tempted to return to smoking, and I hope that re-reading my reasons for quitting, along with any other helpful advice or tidbits that you folks may comment, will be helpful to stay on track. 

Anyways, here are the reasons I have decided to be done:

* For so long, I have told myself that I won't quit until after college, with the justification being that I don't want to miss out on the fun of smoking with my friends. As a senior this year (fourth and final year of University for you non-Americans), I have felt that by quitting now, I am robbing myself of the fun and enjoyment of smoking with my friends in the time of life when it is most appropriate and fun. However, I now realize that smoking reduces my enjoyment of college - it makes me less sociable, less confident, less outgoing, and overall makes me have less fun. I've had my logic backwards this whole time - by quitting now, I am not robbing myself of a semester of enjoying weed with my friends, I am *gifting* myself the chance to enjoy just one semester of college without all the brain fog, financial strain of addiction, diminished confidence, and so on that comes with smoking. 
* I can't really afford to smoke. As a student with no income, it is absolutely insane that I have been blowing through a quarter ounce a week for - well, I'm not even really sure how long, and even beginning to calculate how much money I've spent on weed gives me a headache. On this note, I am using an app called [grounded](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grounded-quit-cannabis/id1463294846) to keep track of my journey of quitting, and it keeps track of how much money I've saved based on my estimate of how much I smoked and how much I paid for weed. It already says I have saved four bucks - not bad for half a day, and I believe it because on most days I would have already had a bowl or two (or three...) by now! I am hoping to go on the stereotypical post-graduation, shoestring-budget backpacking trip around Europe this summer - I could probably fund it entirely from money saved from weed. 
*  I don't even really enjoy it - the book I'm reading (The joy of quitting cannabis, linked at the top) has taught me that the drive to smoke comes from my brain's perception that it will make me feel good, but when I really analyze my thoughts and feelings, being high isn't fun at all. It doesn't make me giggly or happy or creative. After my last session last night, I tried to think really critically about what I felt - my conclusion was, I feel pretty normal except a little dizzy and uncomfortable. 
* Weed doesn't solve the craving - something else I've noticed from the book is that once I start craving weed, smoking doesn't make it go away. Once I start smoking, I just want to smoke more. This cycle continues until I am uncomfortably high and/or coughing too much to continue. The feeling of craving is so overwhelming, but now I see that giving into it doesn't make it go away, and it is time to try a new approach (quitting) to get rid of it for good. 
* I want to feel more ""in the driver's seat"" of my life, be present and enjoy the moment, and just be generally happier. I have begun to realize that no matter how many self-help books and articles I read and changes I try to implement, I am systematically undermining my own attempts to improve my life because of my weed smoking. 

Well, this post has gotten much longer than I intended but I certainly think it will be helpful to revisit in the future! I would love to hear any thoughts, ideas, or advice from other people on their journey of quitting weed. Thanks so much in advance for any input!

One last thought - I can't wait to see the look on my friends faces when I go back to school for the upcoming semester and give away my weed stuff. I've got bongs, a dab rig, a vaporizer, one-hitters, a vaporizer, and all sorts of other random shit I won't be needing anymore - can't wait to get rid of it all!",4

I decided on the 10th December to stop smoking for good after smoking every day for over a year so I could go back home for the holidays sober. After my last smoke I had what I presume was my first panic attack immediately after and haven’t felt the same since. My anxiety has been through the roof although it’s calmed down a bit but the main issue is my nose and ears being constantly blocked as well as what feels like chest congestion, this is giving me feelings of shortness of breath. My digestion isn’t good at all, it feels as if the food just sits in my chest and pills get easily stuck in my throat and I get constant vertigo because of the blocked ears. Ive taken antacids and tried everything to unblock my nose and ears and the hospital isnt sure either. I’ve quit cold turkey before but never had any effects this extreme, I’m hoping it’s just withdrawals and nothing more serious. Has anyone gone through anything similar?",1

Time to take my life back!!! As for many of us, the past few years have been rough and I am finally ready to COMMIT to making a CHANGE. I want to accomplish many things but don’t know how realistic of a goal this is.

I’m only about to turn 21 but I have not been living to the standard that I feel like I should be living. Currently in college and been antisocial, lethargic, not eating enough, lazy, stress, anxiety, and dealing with addictions. I pretty much want to address every one of these problems but know it’s going to take a lot of willpower and discipline.

I have a list of resolutions I want to achieve in 2022 (I’m only using Jan 1st as the day of actually being serious because I want to use New Years Eve as my final farewell to my filthy addictions), so let me hear your thoughts on it and let me know what you’re trying to achieve for the new year.

2022 RESOLUTIONS:

- no weed
- no nicotine
- limit caffeine consumption 
- limit drinking to only special occasions
- no porn or masterbation
- wake up early everyday
- limit screen time to 2 hours per day (sometimes I would get 10 hours of screen time on bad days)
- workout 5 days of the week
- stay consistent with diet (add calories)
- read Bible daily and establish relationship with God
- no more procrastinating homework til last minute
- less cursing
- cold showers in the morning
- drink gallon of water daily
- take up new hobbies such as learning Korean and playing guitar
- get out of my comfort zone and start talking to strangers
- take care of skin and hair etc 
- learn to budget/save/make money

- NO COMPLAINING OR EXCUSES",7

It’s tempting to use events such as a birthday or New Years as a jumping off point towards a new habit, but when it comes to addiction I’ve found that these dates are completely arbitrary.  

What is most important in the quitting process is the internal desire to get through it no matter what happens.  I found that every time I tried to use a date to quit smoking it wouldn’t stick, because the date comes and goes and a week later the motivation from setting that date as a quitting point starts to fade.  In the end I stopped smoking on a random Wednesday with no significance because I felt it was time.  If you think you are at a point where you can use New Years as a day to quit, I urge you to quit today then, because the date shouldn’t really matter.  

Good luck to everyone on here who’s had a problem and gotten clean, imo it’s one of the strongest bravest and hardest things a person can do.  Happy New Years and to a weed free 2022!",18

I made a post here 8 years ago, made an attempt to quit that didn't last longer than a week. Now I'm at the point in my life where I want to get healthier, I want to have a family. 

Now more often then not when I smoke, I want to be sober (yet when I'm sober, I cry thinking about the cravings). It's become so casual, so routine. I don't get red eyes, it's become so easy to smoke before anything and appear perfectly sober. Then I started thinking about how fucked that is. How I feel like I need to smoke before every movie, dinner or event. 

I feel out of control. I feel like it has an iron grip on me. I keep justifying things I shouldn't need to. ""I can't quit because I just started a new job and if I am emotional and out of sorts I won't be working to my fullest potential."" ""I can't quit now because... anything."" I just keep making these excuses for myself. 

I guess I don't know exactly why I'm making this post. Maybe I feel if I reach out to people, people who are dealing with the same thoughts or feelings, maybe I won't feel so alone. 

I'm lucky enough my partner is super supportive. He doesn't smoke, but it's never bothered him that I did. Maybe that will make things easier, having a sober partner?

i'm so happy to say that this is the longest i've gone without getting high and it gets so much easier as time goes by. going from intense cravings, night sweats, nightmares, and irritability and depression, to feeling clear headed, grounded, stable, able to manage my emotions and move through them, and like i can better socialize and connect with others has been so motivating. my lungs are clear, my throat doesn't hurt, and regular coughing is a thing of the past. i don't experience cravings anymore, albeit occasionally on a long hard day i'll wish i had something to use to unwind. however, i'm working on adding healthier hobbies like yoga, meditation, knitting, and journalling into my evenings to cope instead. i feel a lot more free and capable of handling what life throws my way. i don't feel like i'm at the mercy of a plant or my cravings anymore. it is so freeing! 

please know life gets so much better. i can't believe i'm closer to 6 months than i am to the time i quit! i wish you all the motivation and courage to succeed in your desire to quit. you can do this!",12

One thing I’ve never had is good sleep quality. Sleeping through the night or mostly through the night has never been a huge issue, but the days where I wake up feeling actually rested are few and far between. 

Is there anyone out there that 1. Has smoked as long as me and in a similar phase of life (IE, started as a young teen) 2. Quit, but not after daily use (I would expect more sleep issues if I had been smoking all day every day prior to this quit, but that isn’t the case), and 3. noticed sleep quality has gotten better after some period of time, even if they were able to mostly sleep fine (duration wise) earlier than that?

I decided this cannot go on for any longer or before I know it, I’ll be 30 and still in this hole. No way it’s acceptable. I quit on the Christmas Day and it’s been hell, to say the least. I’ve lost my sleep to the point I fall asleep at 5 AM and wake up at noon. Luckily work is chill during the holidays so not that big of a deal but man I’m concerned. Not just sleep, my appetite is also almost nonexistent. But again, my biggest concern is my sleep anomalies. 

I read a ton of posts and comments here and realized it’s kinda normal to experience it. But man, I haven’t been smoking for THAT long, and in my head I always thought the “addiction” is not that big of a deal. Oh boy, could I be any more wrong. This has been pretty hard but feels good that my body is “normalizing”. 

Can I get some pointers on what can be done to remedy this problem? I read some saying just give it time and it’ll be better soon.

Last night I had a strange dream. It wasn’t too bad, though I feel as if I hadn’t been dreaming every night since about 3 days being sober it would’ve been more of a nightmare. 

Firstly, I remember it was me, my brother and dad sitting on a railway track that was lifted above the sea but near a city. The sky was dark and creepy, almost what you would think the Halloween sky would look like as a kid. It stayed like that for the rest of the dream. I remember my dad telling me we were going to hitch a ride into the city. 

So the train slows down and we jump on one of the carriages (this wasn’t a passenger train, it was like the train in gta 5 but instead of the carriages having nothing in them it was full of some sort of hard substance that we sat on) the train started moving and it felt like a rollercoaster, the tracks were over water the whole time and the train went fast. We held on for dear life and eventually got to a pitch black underpass (the tracks disappeared and I just rememebr the conductor running through it. I put my phone torch on and we all followed.

I saw a friend I knew in secondary school who I haven’t seen in years. 6’7 we used to call him because well… he was 6’7. I spoke to him and his friend and then I remember being at a table outside with my dad brother and a few other people who’s faces I can’t recall. We were drinking and then I wanted to go to bed. Since we had to get a hotel I started to walk towards this huge building but I heard bombs going off. In my head the building was collapsing but I found out later that it was actually gunshots and it was a group of women terrorists (don’t ask me why) who had taken over the hotel and were just killing people. 

The details after this were fuzzy but I remember being on the building and one of the women was chasing me trying to shoot me. I jumped off the top of this probably 30 floor building and got up like I just fell off my bed. I started to run and eventually jumped on top of a train which then turned into a sliced loaf of bread. Eventually, it started to go up like stairs, stairs made of slices of bread. I got on top of this platform, mind you this is over the sea and it is still dark. The platform seemed to be unbalanced and I kept having to move to one side or else it would tip to the other. I rememebr getting a call from one of the terrorists saying they had tied up my dad and stabbed him to death. Now usually this would’ve been a nightmare but I had a sense of knowing that I was dreaming which helped me enjoy the dream, especially the next part.

So of course I was enraged at this point and I just remember being inside the building in first person exactly like it would be in rainbow six seige with the leaning and all. I remember shooting maybe 4-5 people before I woke up. The funny part was when I killed someone I would see score points but they were only +1. 

That was when I woke up but still it was a weird dream and I think I’m addicted to seige.

Today marks two weeks of being completely sober from cannabis, and its 3 days from a month that I quit all other substances.

However, fuck I want to smoke so bad. I'm not going to, but this feels super hard for like no reason... I haven't been feeling depressed recently, but today is an exception.

The only thing running through my had is getting high, I might just need to sleep, as I know I'll feel better when I wake up, but fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

What can I tell myself? What can I do? I'm about to go take a shower and then after imma put a sleep mask on and just go to bed.

But I'm not enjoying this, I know withdrawal isn't supposed to be enjoyable, but I can feel that little voice in my head, the one that keeps telling me I'm a failure, a loser, and a drug addict.. it's really putting up a fucking fight today.

I'm in tears writing this. I didn't want this life. I could have done so much more.. I had the opportunities and the ambition.. but I fucking threw it all away.. I'm a damn hollow shell of what I used to be, and it's eating me up inside.

I haven't had suicidal thoughts in years, but today at work I broke down just having all these fucking possibilities running through my head. I'm ashamed of it, but I just couldn't stop them from coming on.

I'm not gonna do it, I'm quite far from it, but just the fact it was running through my head again really got to me..... I need to go to bed.",7

I had a few weeks in an illegal estate where I lived with religious family and that helped me make the first step, but now I’m back in California and hitting up a dispensary isn’t even on my mind remotely. 

Overall I feel better- I still have a good amount of insomnia that I’m trying to work on- I’ve basically become nocturnal, staying up till 5 am and sleeping till noon. Night sweats are back, on and off. I occasionally get super clammy. 

My appetite was horrible this past two years, I lost a lot of weight and couldn’t keep food down. It turns out it was almost definitely CHS from smoking regularly. I’ve been eating 3 meals a day since day 4 or so and it’s so so wonderful to finally not feel hungry all the time. It’s silly to think I was choosing weed over literal food for years. I can’t believe the pain it caused me that was so unnecessary. I’m joining a new MA group close to my apartment so I have a little bit of community and some people to hold me accountable for staying sober. 

I was cleaning out my old apartment today and came across a pipe and a cart with a little resin left. A few weeks ago I would have scraped the pipe and smoked whatever I could, and smoked the cart till it tasted like burnt metal. Today I threw them in the trash without a second thought and kept cleaning like it was nothing. 

Just keeping up with the posts so I can read these in the future if I need motivation, and it’s convenient that Redd keeps track of the days I’ve gone without. 

I feel so good being clean from this, it’s motivating me to quit nic next hopefully.",6

I wanted to start a discussion because last night my dream was not only so vivid but so abhorrent that I made a throwaway account to talk about it, judgement free. 

It's nighttime, stood smoking in a loose acquaintance's 'backgarden' (I've never been to or seen his house), an aeroplane flies overhead and suddenly a frozen stowaway (a passenger travelling 'illegally' and secretly, usually in luggage or landing gear compartments) falls from the sky into the garden in front of us with a loud bang. My friend doesn't seem too concerned, behaves as though this happens frequently. We finish our cigarettes and go inside, and I realise we're about to sleep in the room that backs onto and has a window looking out on the back garden. Obviously the body's just lying there barely visible in the dark. And the only thing on my mind, despite not wanting to go to sleep with that behind me, is 'there's a dead body in the backgarden and when the sun comes up it's going to start thawing'. I think, for whatever reason, it was all 'inspired' by a similar thing that actually happened to someone in London back in 2019. 

I know we've all lived groundhog day since Covid hit, but for roughly the last 2 years my dreams have been essentially the same, as in occurring in the same place with recurring themes and people, etc. Last night was exceptional, obviously, but they often involve abandoned buildings, old places I used to work and live and, more recently, the most visceral sensation that, unless I grab onto something near me, I'm going to free fall into the sky (username). People are walking around me normally, looking at me strangely as I cling desperately to railings and bollards, friends trying to convince me that it's in my head and even telling my dream self that this is teetering on psychosis-grade delusion, then at some point I'll wake up covered in sweat. 

If you're not too off put by this overly descriptive retelling, please share your own dreams in as much detail as you'd like. Has anyone experienced creating a sort of consistent dreamland comprising of old people and places merged into one? Or a similar dream agoraphobia I seem to have about falling upwards?",3

Fast forward and I'm living in San Diego during Quarantine. The amount of time and money I spent in dispensaries is shameful to say the least. I was able to quit for a while when I moved back home but Delta-9 just filled the space. And now I'm in LA fighting an addiction again.

I'm ashamed at how far this addiction has gone and the impact it's had on my finances. I can't bring myself to tell my fiance about this and ask for her help.

Yesterday I decided was done. I tossed my pen and lighters. I'm starting a new job in January and I want to be clear headed and excel in my new role. I know it will be a hard road. The day isn't even done and I've been going back and forth over having one last smoke, even walked past a dispensary (thankfully they were closed).

24 days have passed since I smoked the last joint.
I'm travelling around Turkey at the moment and probably the best thing about it is, that I don't have access to weed here.

I've been through heavy mental withdrawal symptoms such as depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety. I got through those with the support of my travelmate, lots of meditation and skateboarding.

So now I'm here, lying in a hotelroom somewhere in the south of Turkey and I ask myself so many questions. What's the purpose of my life? Where do I belong? Is there even a point in existing?

It drives me crazy that I don't find answers to those questions. It makes me want the warm and cozy feeling back, that my mind associates with weed, even if I won't get this feeling anymore due to the shit that happened last year (check out my other posts if you're interested).

I feel like I still didn't make the decision to quit entirely. I spend much time with thoughts like ""Next time I smoke, it will be different and way more controlled"" and ""I will be stronger than my urge to consume"".

The shitty thing about it is, that I know I'm running into an opened knife and I'm afraid, that I'll keep running. Weed has already fucked up a lot of things in my life and I still don't want to stop.

This is so fucked up and annoying. I know, that I'm capable of doing big things when I stay sober, but still I want to use weed to cope with my childhood trauma.

a few days later when i felt better about it, i started staying at my apartment again, i noticed the cops left his weed vape behind when investigating his death and i started smoking it everyday as an excuse for the pain i was in until i ran out and i have been buying more. 
it’s been about a month since that has happened and now i’m right back to where i was before i stopped smoking the first time. stomach pains, no sleep, overall just uncomfortable.

I don't like being high at all.  I think what I like the most is going to dispensaries, chatting with the bud tenders, seeing all the new varieties, taking home and unwrapping my new smelly gifts to myself.  It's a classic dopamine rush of 'wanting' not needing.  And when I have it the thrill is not what I expected anymore and I barely get high in a good way, only paranoia and shame.

Timeline of my journey for those starting now.,"I’ve been struggling around Christmas but I know I’m in the clear to make it a year. I’ve been seeing lots of posts of people just starting and thinking about starting. In short: KEEP GOING DON’T GIVE UP!!! ☀️ I felt like I healed a bit slower than average so this timeline would be a good expectation to start with. Everyone has their own journey! Please share yours, your voice matters in this community.

Preparing:

- cut down by pushing start time / total amount smoked. Try packing smaller bowls / rolling shorter. Use a filter or make your own (paper towel and rubber band on bowl)
- start developing easy new habits: have a daily cardio habit like long walk with a podcast or jumping on indoor equipment while watching something. 
- eat vibrant foods! Fresh fruits and vegetables where you can 
- mentally stay focused on wanting to quit, imaging yourself quitting and the person you want to become 

Months 1-3

- first month: every day is a victory! 
- craving intense but tapers down. It’s mostly about dealing with what it was covering up. Anticipate finding healthy ways to deal with what’s underneath
- appetite and eating habits get better towards end of month 3. I was eating much more than I needed and slowly let go of this
- sleep gets better middle of month two and it’s great here at end of month 11
- acupressure mat helped with sleep
- accomplishments: picking up phone in evening because I wasn’t high, being able to make it a month, being able to pass a drug test

Months 3-5

- starting to weed out habits that were coping with the start of process and improving self 
- getting things done time! Clear life clutter
- keep focusing on sleep improvement and moving each day but overall focus on recovery 
- accomplishments: feeling like you know you can keep going, knowing almost at half a year, anxiety reduced and desire to socialize increasing 

Month 5 - 9

- BEWARE: I can just smoke once as a reward. If you’re bargaining you’re still addicted 
- building life you want at slow to medium pace 
- happiness increases and brain fog decreases 
- accomplishments: social results and confidence from not needing to get high, better physical endurance, enjoying more of life 

Months 9-10

- upping game on healthy choices: people around you, self talk, food choices, better physical activity 
- do not smoke! You can see that voice saying you can getting quieter
- really push yourself a few days during this time mentally, physically and with focus
- accomplishments: feeling like you are really on a new track 

Month 11-12

- push yourself more but take time for rest 
- sleep finally back to normal / better than it’s been 
- clearing very old toxic habits 
- brain fog gone! Running helps 
- accomplishments: starting your next year of no smoking leaps above where you started!

You can do it!!",20

First month was excruciating, but after about 4-5 months I felt like I wasn’t being observably affected by it in my mood and thinking, and no longer craved it. However, starting perhaps 3 months after quitting my mouth and throat became dry. Singing is bloody difficult without moisture. I use a steam inhaler and drink loads of water but it doesn’t really help. I vaped dry herb btw, and also used thc oil. I don’t *think* it’s my prescription medication because the dry mouth started six months after starting med 1 and three months after med 2, and typically such side effects occur strongest when starting and then lessen. 

Anyway, has anyone else had persistent dry mouth after quitting weed? It’s really getting me down not being able to sing. 

Also, when I came out of the weed bubble I suddenly noticed how much my family fidgets, and I can’t un-notice it. It triggers strong anxiety. Not sure if it’s paws causing hyper vigilance or just my un-weeded ptsd. 

Finally, probably just un-weeded me, but perhaps paws, my anxiety and depression has gotten worse since quitting, starting around three months clean, sometimes so much so I feel like I’m going backwards. Feel numb and unconnected to people. Makes it hard to keep doing the work between psychotherapy sessions.

One day almost a year ago something clicked and I’m almost to the milestone which I’m going to breeze by in a few days. A year seems like a long time when you’re trying to quit, I questioned myself on many occasions if I would even be able to do it. The truth is that you can always turn things around if you have a big enough reason.

I was a productive stoner for the most part but deep down I always felt like I was selling myself short and falling into mediocrity by not living up to my fullest potential.

It may be self-righteous but it feels good, and seems to be a common practice on the internet; you feel both anger and satisfaction at the same time.

Doing the same when quitting weed has been *extremely* validating. Anytime I'd normally be getting high, instead I seek out posts where people downplay addiction to weed just for the chance to think ""I was fooled into thinking the same thing once."" Maybe what they say is *their* truth, but it'll never be mine. That level of self-awareness is something to take serious pride in, and the feeling of making it through the cravings without acting on them is greater than anything else I've felt in a very long time. Yes, that includes being high.

I’ve been smoking weed daily since I was 17, with very infrequent breaks. 

Lately, it’s been getting to me. Mostly time, and my life experiences. I feel as though I’ve been high for the last 5 years and have lost that time completely. It all hit me at once out of nowhere, how I was spending my entire life stoned. 

Key critical points of my life feel as though they have slipped away completely. It’s hard to explain what I’m feeling; it’s like I look at old pictures of myself and it feels like it never happened. I look at my parents nearing 60 and my younger sister who is now 18 (WTF???!). It’s like all of this was normal till now. It’s like I just glitched from 17 to 21. I feel old as fuck out of nowhere. Since when did I grow into a man. My childhood is permanently over. 

I am 3 days clean, and emotions and thoughts and anxieties about life are barreling through my brain like a freight train. Sorry if this doesn’t make much sense. 

I fear death, but worse, I fear waking up one day and being 50 years old, with my parents gone, my youth gone, my dog gone, time gone. That truly sends shivers through my whole body. 

It’s time to sober up. As hard as this is for me, I have no choice. Weed has completely disconnected me from reality. I have to get my mind and my life back. It’s hard to believe I spent 15 years of my life completely sober. Feels like that part of my experience never happened. Fuck man. What have I done",22

I don't really know my intention for this post, other than distracting myself and looking for support. My friends would support me (I know many with stoner friends aren't so lucky) but I honestly feel like I would get irritable if I tried to call them and they started giving advice and support while they are over there lighting up.

2021-12-28 19:35:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rqudkg/off_my_chest_it_makes_me_angry_watching_friends/,Off my chest: It makes me angry watching friends and other people thrive while regularly smoking pot.,"I smoked pot for four years, from my freshman year of college to shortly after graduation (stopped in January 2020). During that time, I made some really good friends, and my closest circle smoked a lot of weed. Every day, multiple times some days, before we went out and did anything, you know the drill.

Why did I stop? I think there's a lot of reasons. I was depressed, and I needed to start taking action and start making the tougher decisions. Having pot available makes it so easy to say ""Maybe I *could* exercise/read/reach out to someone for a chat, but I could also just get high.""

Did it work? Tough to tell. Life isn't exactly ideal now. But I think I'm making progress. Very slow progress. It's two steps forward, one step back. Lol, sometimes it's two steps back. I often get into a rut where I lose my sense of drive, but I always find my way back. Pot would make that harder, it would dig me deeper into a hole. I'm not going back to pot.

Anyway, that's my story, now to vent: All my friends from college are still smoking pot. And you know what: they're thriving. Some of them more than me it seems. They're getting out, making friends, staying in good shape, doing well in their jobs. It makes me feel super wrong about a lot of my decisions. 

I remind myself all the time: you can't compare yourself to others. You never know how they actually feel. Maybe all my friends are putting on a front, and don't feel like they're thriving, and they're struggling just like me. Maybe not. Maybe we're just different people, and we react to pot differently. Maybe I can't use pot without losing control of my life, while they can.

One reason I stopped is because of a sense of injustice. I have a lot of privilege in life. There are people with tougher jobs and tougher circumstances who can't afford to be stoned all of the time. It seems like if I have the freedom to get high and take it easy, then that's the same freedom I could use to work towards something and give back. 

Looking at my friends, it pisses me off that they don't think like that. I know that's very ""holier than thou."" It's their life, and they're not hurting anyone. None of us have any obligation to save the world. I just feel like I'm depressed over hard truths, while they live in convenient ignorance.

This is a complicated feeling I'm trying to sort out. I think it's clear that I'm jealous of some of my friends who are doing well. It's also clear that I've got some issues of my own to work on. At the end of the day, I can't compare my experience to others. I'm not out to save the world, but I believe I can use my privilege for the good, and I'm going to work towards that.",64
2021-12-28 19:27:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rqu6om/its_been_years/,It's been years,"Here's the story: my entire life, my Mom has smoked weed. She used to like cigs too, but thankfully quit that habit. Weed, however, is a different story. She will never quit, and I've come to terms with that. Sorta. The hiccup is... it's always around. I didn't complain for the first few times. That contentment led to weeks, weeks led to months, and moths led to years.   
It's become something that my family and I use all the time: Christmas Celebrations, Thanksgiving (no ""walks"" to the car for this family), and birthdays. It's all fun and good, but lately I can't help but wonder if we can do better. My mom gets ill *often* and I can't help but wonder if its from those three dabs she did that day (and pretty much *every* day frankly) or if she's just getting older.   
The main point is I'm noticing things that I haven't before. I've realized if I want to do better in life, that is my responsibility and *only* mine. Lately, weed has been so ubiquitous that it is hard to go a day without it, especially with offers from both family and friends.

 I'm writing this because I need assistance. I love weed, I really do, but it's too much. I do it every day. And when I see others smoking, I get such an urge to smoke it's almost like it can't be contained and I'm involuntarily reaching for the bong. So, I need to know, if this were your situation and you want to ditch weed for good, what would you do? I can't move out, and my family isn't likely to kick their smoking just because I am. (Did I mention members of my family work at a dispensary? Yeah, when I say it's everywhere.... whew.)

I love weed, LOVE IT. BUT I am quick to get dependent on it. I am successful enough, its never hurt me. I have taken stints off of it before, and maybe this wont be forever, but I'm going to give it a go. I don't have much support in my life so I am coming here. 

For me the biggest negative side effect is not being able to eat. I have been to many holidays and not been able to smoke, and can't eat....... on THANKSGIVING. Year after year. I haven't noticed anyone who has such negative effects on their eating habits like me. I usually end up eating a bunch at night, then waiting til the next night to eat. Ill wake up gagging and starving. Its miserable. So im incorporating some new diet into my process, even though I eat pretty healthily anyway. Oh and if I'm not smoking, I have the worst shits. Like diarrhea all the time, like literally every time I shit, and many times a day..... until I smoke. Not uncontrollable but definitley a mess. I assume that will get better as my gut adjusts to no THC. 

&#x200B;

I am not one to drive while high, especially at night, which is another reason why I am going to let it go. I have been affected with depression or adhd or something FOR A LONG FUCKING TIME (undiagnosed) well before I started smoking weed. I also am not a super social person, and for me weed absolutely makes it way worse when i'm high. IF IT WAS LEGAL this social anxiety shit probably wouldn't effect me as much. 

&#x200B;

I hid the bong and the weed this morning. I have only quit in the past when I smoked it all up, which usually looks like me POUNDING it as it gets closer to being gone. (drug addict like behavior)

Anyway. Im here, Ill see how sleeping goes tonight. Anticipate, not a lot of sleeping and night sweats. Joy.

But Overall, I just hate feeling beholden to the drug. I don’t allow myself to drink caffeine. But weed I think about first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. 

It has a hold of my brain and that alone is bad. I would have all of the above without the weed so why am I wasting the money and risking health? Well because I like it and it hasn’t seemed to have any severe negative effects on my life.

I'm 36 years old. I first smoked when I was 13. I started smoking regularly by 15. By 18 I was a full blown pothead, smoking all day everyday.

I had a one ounce per month habit, but I didn't make enough money to support it. I stole from my mom. I stole from my sister. I sold prized possessions. I was a regular at the CoinStar machine.

Eventually, I made enough to support my habit. Every event was an occasion to smoke. Waking up, going to bed, before eating, after eating, watching TV, leaving the house, coming home, and so on.

But something changed in 2020. I started smoking only at night to conserve my stash. Then I found myself skipping nights. Then I found myself going weeks without smoking. Finally, on 12/28/2020, I smoked a joint with my cousin and realized that I just don't like being high anymore. I knew that from that point on, I'd never smoke again. And I haven't.

My mom had a similar experience with weed. She smoked like a chimney for 20 years, but in her 30's she just lost her taste for it.

My dad, my brothers, my uncle's, my cousins, and my friends smoke. They smoke around me. But I haven't had the slightest urge (although I do miss the social aspect of going outside and joining the circle). I still enjoy the smell of fresh herbs, but the smell of burnt weed is repulsive.

I said in a previous post that I don't feel as though I ""quit"" smoking weed. Quitting requires tremendous effort (I tried a handful of times). Instead, I feel as though I ""finished"" smoking weed. I'm done. And 12/28 is now a personal holiday: ""Finishing Day"".

I am sober for 6 weeks now and it is weird. Before I started smoking I did not have any hobbies besides playing video games after school. When I started it quickly became my whole identity and I basically smoked every day. I was also always surronded by people who all smoked and and I kept isolating myself from other people. It took me a few years to realise that this is not the life I want (anymore). However, these people were the only ones I socialized with but I had to distance myself from them. I fell into depression and this makes everything even worse. What keeps me motivated to stay sober is that I want to retry getting my degree so I can go to university. 

After 6 weeks I still find it hard to not think about weed because it was basically all I had on my mind for the last years. What helped you fighting that mental dependence? I would like to know!

Its been freeing to know that i dont need a substance to access a space within myself that i like to escape to.

In the morning I woke up with thoughts like ""oh my god what did you do? You decided to not smoke anymore."" It felt like a disaster but I handled not to smoke one in the morning as I usually do. I want to see it as a challenge for the next 28 days to not smoke and within this time integrating new healthy habits. I need to get fulfilled within without weed. But I am scared that I will not manage to quit again. Like all the other attempts. I am smoking for 6 years now and even was afraid to get addicted from the beginning on and tried to quit smoking after one year already. I couldn't. And still smoking. So I kinda lost the trust in myself that I can do it but I want to believe this time I can do it. The other thing is that I like to be high every now and then. I see it like a holy plant but I am abusing it and that's what I don't want anymore. I don't want to be controlled by it rather do I want to have the control about it. I will keep you updated how it goes. But also the thought to admit that I might have been fallen back at one point is hardly to bear.

He was a good friend and had some public hardships at the end of his life.  He was a year younger than me; 33.  He’s now the umpteenth person who has passed away in the last two years from my old line of work of being in the service / entertainment industry.  We weren’t particularly close, but he’s the first person who has passed that I shared real and meaningful time with.  I went back to the club I worked at last night after leaving back in August wanting to grieve with old co-workers, but it was probably the worst decision I could have made since that place and the people in it were always incredibly toxic.  I had a couple of drinks real quick and went back home.  I took some supplements and got three hours of sleep before getting kicked out of it at what’s now 1:30 AM.  I’m struggling to stay the course.  

Weed would typically help me in these situations.  At the very least, it’d held me sleep.  I’m not sure what’s withdrawal anymore and what’s just straight up depression.  This year has been particularly hard and I’ve kept hoping that each day that I’d be moving towards complete sobriety,  I’d be feeling the rewards of it.  Sure, the brain fog and the anxiety that’d come from smoking has gone away, but I’m feeling pretty low.  I’ve got a therapy appointment later today, so there’s that, but, for the first time, I’m having cravings.  Maybe not of smoking itself, but I’m missing the immediate ‘cure’ of vaping dry herb.  

Emotionally, I’m feeling overwhelmed and physically I’m just feeling worn down.  My brain is telling me that this isn’t worth it and that I should just give up and try this whole quitting cold turkey thing at a ‘more convenient time.’  I know that’s my addict brain talking, but damn is it hard to not listen to it when I’m having a hard time getting good sleep and dealing with loss in several different forms lately.  

19 days in and it feels like it’s just getting worse.  I read a lot of other posts on here that make me feel alone in what I’m experiencing.  Seems like things should be getting a little easier but the nightmares, sleep problems and just general depression/anxiety have been fairly consistent.  I’m aware that there are other issues that need to be addressed in therapy, but I’m just trying to hang on to my sobriety in the face of a potential new job coming through and not wanting to relapse after the hard work I’ve already put in.",8

My major cravings have gone away and most days I don’t even think about getting high. It’s only when I eat something that doesn’t sit right/get anxious and then in result get a lil nauseous, do I miss it. It’s never been so bad that I want to puke, but it’s gotten close. And these times are the only times I absolutely crave and miss thc. I miss how it took away every ache, pain, icky feeling and so on. There are natural things I try when I feel icky these days, mostly ginger herbal tea. But yeah. It’s an icky night. And I wish I could smoke a bowl, even though I know it would make things worse with how low my tolerance is. I’d love to hear from you guys, If you feel the same or if you have tips for nausea (anxiety and/or food related). But I’m also just posting to get the thought out of my head. I’m really proud of how far I’ve come. Soon it’ll be 200 days and truly nothing will ever get me to pick up weed again. Wish me luck that I can fall asleep fast and not lay in bed feeling how nauseous I am for an hour. 

Ps- this only happens maybe once, twice max, a month. I would get way more nauseous when I heavily smoked, mostly bc I wasn’t eating nearly enough and suppressing every bad feeling with weed. So on the off chance anyone who just quit is reading this, the early nausea/lack of appetite days go away pretty quickly. And every day since i quit has been amazing.

I think many people including myself see quitting weed as simply stopping smoking, but it’s deeper then that. There’s a reason we have a problem with self control and keep getting stuck in this cycle. 

I was reading this book which has been amazing at helping me pull the roots out the ground instead of just the weeds on the surface. It was talking about how all self sabotage behaviour is simply a defence mechanism to fulfil a certain need we’re not receiving from every day life. This is where the work gets hard and we needa take a deep look at ourselves and our situations and think about what parts of our lives need work. What is causing the feeling that’s making us want to smoke? Is it difficulty connecting with people? Fear of feeling our emotions? Is it a subsconscious belief that we can never be successful? Loneliness? Get real honest. Then you needa take action, which will be uncomfortable. But it’s the only way. Once we start addressing the root cause, I feel like this “weed addiction” will vanish into thin air.. but we need to heal. Good luck y’all.",21

It’s not legal and I dont know a dealer here, my strict parents are home 24/7 in a small house, and I have no car. So it hasn’t really been an option for me. However, I’m about to go back home on Jan 1 and I’m really nervous about keeping it up. It’s legal where I live, I have a dispensary 1 block from my apartment, I work from home, no roommates, not a huge support system in my city (don’t have one here really either but at least I’m kind of held accountable by my parents’ presence).

I want to create a better life for myself and I know I can’t do that if I’m smoking, but I’m nervous I’ll break once I’m back home again. I’ve tried to quit a few times before and always use vacation or visiting my parents to kick start the process bc of less access/more accountability while away, but I’ve always relapsed shortly after (1-2 weeks) I return home.

46 days here without weed. I said in my first post here that I was quitting drinking as well. That did not last as long but its also not as problematic as it was before I quit. I still plan on cutting way back on the drinking or maybe even quitting. But I'm just glad to be done with the weed. 

I can actually think proper thoughts these days. I used to think my brain was okay when I was smoking weed. After being sober this long I know it was not okay. Life's f@$%king tough. It may be easy to just gather 20 bucks, get your weed fix and continue to be okay, but its not the best thing for you, and it likely never will be. It could also be the worst thing for you, if you're someone like me. 

I remember watching friends in high school/college smoke weed when they wanted and it wasn't a problem for them, they would still succeed, have a lot of fun, build great relationships. That just wasn't the case for me, and it used to be tough for me to admit that. I just always wanted more. I wanted to feel high or even just not feel anything. 

The drinking certainly isn't helping either but I'm taking everything one drug at a time. After the drinking, its the nicotine. I've got big plans for my life, and I've always had big plans for my life. Unfortunately, weed got in may way a lot, in fact way too much, and I just indulged that feeling like there was no tomorrow. Well, I'm not going to wonder what it would be like if I never got hooked on the party life, I'm going to find out what I can do without it. 

I'm still struggling to get my life straight, because I did irreversible damage, but all I know is it's been easier to focus on succeding with the pride I now have from quitting weed. I know they say to take things one day at a time but that NA/AA stuff never worked for me. That's exactly why I joined this subreddit. I've been here since day -1 and I'll be here updating you on my progress until I die, hopefully to inspire at least one person to take charge of their life, and not let the leaf rule theirs. 

I'm so grateful for this community, the anonymity, the positivity, the stories, and the combined will to help others struggling with what held their life back. Thank you so much r/leaves and don't ever stop. Maybe not everyone needs to quit the weed, but if you're here reading this, be honest with yourself, you definitely do.",11

Just had a pretty bad relapse experience and wanted to get it off my chest. I’ve been trying to quit since July. Nowadays I’m making it about 1 week between relapses. I was 1 week sober when I got to my parents place for Christmas, excited to stay there for the week and hopefully make it to 2 weeks (I live in CO, they live in IL). Anyway, on Christmas Eve I got massive cravings and ended up making up some excuse to drive to the dispo for a dab pen. Hit it once in my bedroom, immediately the whole room smelled massively like weed (never happened to me before with a pen). Minutes later my parents are asking if I smell a skunk, asking if I need their air purifier “for background noise”. Pretty sure they new exactly what was going on but my parents and I have a rocky past and recently things have been better so I think they just wanted to leave me alone. I spent the next 4 hours laying in bed having the worst, most paranoid high of my entire career. Keep thinking I can hear my parents in the other room talking about me smoking (even thought I heard them talking to police for some reason). Just spiraling out of control that I’m a disappointment and feeling so ashamed for relapsing and at the same time overwhelmed by bad memories from childhood. I spent Christmas Day sobbing on and off, mostly just hiding in my room drowning in guilt. Made up an excuse and left the family 6 days early (didn’t even get to see my sister, she’s a nurse and had to work the 25th-27th). I’m back home now completely devastated and ashamed. Any of you guys been here before? How do I move forward from this guilt and shame?

I quit once at the beginning of this year for around one month, but once I started up again I was smoking even more than I was before my break (with the original intention to quit). I can’t even remember how I got to this point, it feels like it was once a fun activity to do with a group of friends and then all of the sudden I was doing it constantly. A few weeks ago, I said to myself I would not smoke during the day, only at night when I was finished with everything I needed to do. I then found myself on my ass every night, essentially making up for what I didn’t smoke during the day. 

Throughout the years all I’ve heard is “you can’t become addicted to weed.” (Making my guard go completely down). While this may be true, scientifically speaking, I sure as hell grew dependent on it. I don’t know why dependency is viewed as less of an issue than addiction, when really it can be just as debilitating in some cases. I know there are some parallels in the definitions of addiction and dependency, but they are still different. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is there is very little support for people trying to quit THC. I know there is a large population of people who genuinely benefit from the effects of THC, and for a long time I thought I fell under that group. When in reality, it was ruining me, and I was smoking just to hide out alone all day. And with that being said, it’s my third day THC free.

Even as I write it, I can't envision it. (I decided to cut down a lot on alcohol because I've always abused it and I think sobriety for me has to be as total as possible for it to work). I also feel like people won't take me seriously if I tell them weed is an addiction for me and I don't know how I would deal with that. Plus, I have a lot of social anxiety and I've always done drugs to help with it. I'm set on living life sober, I'm starting to see a future for myself and I'm afraid that's going to crumble as soon as I go out again. For anyone who's been there, do you have any advice on how to deal with this ?",3

It always gave me anxiety and I was always kinda scared of it but I smoked anyways. Almost every day for about 6 months. After awhile the amount of anxiety i got was insane so I finally decided it was time to stop. It’s been about a week and a half now since i’ve stopped. I have felt just off since i’ve stopped and i’ve read up on it a lot. Apparently it’s like depersonalization or something like that, and it causes things to just not feel real and it gives me so much anxiety. I was just wondering if anyone going through the same thing as me can relate and give any advice.

2021-12-27 17:51:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rpzoo9/does_this_resonate_with_you/,Does this resonate with you?,"I believe that drug addiction is related to finding stimulation in one’s environment. I hypothesize that one of the reason quitting an addiction is so hard is because when someone is attempting to quit the remove many of the things that they used to get stimulated by. 

I’ll use myself as an example; when I try to quit I often attempt to avoid hanging out with the friends that I know will encourage me to smoke. As a result I’m often the most lonely when I’m attempting to be sober. This leads to a lack of stimulation, aka boredom, which  I find unbearable. This is on top of the fact that during this time I’d be dealing with the worst of the withdrawal symptoms. 

So, here is what I’ve learned. I cannot stand the boredom associated with withdrawing. I’m fact, I once watched an experiment where it was shown that people will choose physical pain over boredom. That to me somewhat explains why an addict will continue to use even though they are well aware that it is hurting them.

How can the you avoid being bored then? That unfortunate truth is that sometimes you cannot avoid it. For example, right before writing this post I was bored. But I had some strange urge to write this post; I hope that someone benefits from reading it as a result. But I just started small and I found that as I wrote more and more thoughts came to my head. That’s how I’ve been able to escape the dreadful feeling of just sitting there and ruminating on how bad I feel. I believe that doing anything is better than doing nothing.

I know that this isn’t super structured or logical. I’m posting the rant for myself but really I do hope that if someone needed to read this that they were able to find it.

Good luck everyone and remember that you CAN do this!",3

Week One was surprisingly easy. I had so much energy and motivation, I almost didn't know what to do with myself. It felt like quitting was gonna solve ALL my problems.

Week Two was the hardest. Turns out quitting didn't solve all my problems. And that pissed me off to no end. I wanted it to be easy. I wanted my life to change overnight. But I still had troubles and struggles. Anxieties and cravings. I had some really black moods and some really angry days.

BUT once I got through that, Week Three was easier. Week Four was even easier.

I had no craving and no temptation to smoke over the holidays, even though my roommates were toking. I honestly feel better without it.

My lungs are still cleaning themselves out but I'm coughing much less than I used to. I'll hack up a little phlegm before bed or in the morning after waking up, and then I'm good for the rest of the day.

Anxiety has drastically diminished.

I've experienced so many other good symptoms of quitting that [I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rghy63/day_18_some_expected_and_unexpected_benefits_of/) if you want to read them.

Though I'm one month sober, what you can't see are all the weeks and months leading up to this point, where I really struggled to reduce my reliance on cannabis. For years I didn't trust that I COULD quit. I ""needed"" it too much. This journey has taken much longer than one month. It was not an overnight success.

weed isn't an option for me anymore. because sobriety isn't the problem, so getting high is not the solution.

there's a brokenness inside of me that i make bigger each time i escape in the fog weed gives me. it's time to address that emptiness, and getting high wont address it.

there's nothing wrong with sobriety, but there's something wrong with my desire to escape it. my fear of myself and this void within me, fear of others, fear of life really. it's time for it to go. one day at a time

instead of counting each minute sober and hoping i'll get better. im now making each minute count as much as possible by addressing the void, addressing bad habits, and mending them little by little.

im committed now. no matter how long it takes; weeks, months, years. i am sober now. and i'm committed to finding my joy here; not fabricating it.

I figured my anxiety was just burnout-- normal for pre-med students under pressure from parents who had treated them as ""gifted"" when younger-- and didn't change my habits, stopping only for the month following brain surgery post-graduation. I've since made it through a part-time masters degree while working part-time and have managed to hold down my current full-time job, so I didn't suspect that weed had any effect on my mental state. 

It was just the opposite.

I cannot say that weed ""gave me anxiety,"" as much as I would like something to blame. Rather, weed has taken root in the cracks of my psyche and grown insidiously, slowly fragmenting me as a growing tree splits a boulder. My self-consciousness, my concerns surrounding career change, my parentally inculcated worry about disappointing those around me-- these fears and more have all been exacerbated by this damn plant.  And the worst part? As weed works to paralyze me in fear, I turn to it for relief.

Big surprise, I got COVID while traveling (am vaccinated so the little symptoms I’ve had have been mild). So I’ve been isolating in her guest room for 9 days so far. 

Before my trip someone I look up to encouraged me to use this trip to get sober, which seemed improbable since my moms as much of a stoner as I am and we usually smoke a lot when I visit. However, this time I chose to give it a shot and have managed to stay sober. I can smell her weed from the other room now, but for the most part she’s helped keep it away from me. 

I had a COVID scare about a month ago, and after 2 weeks clean (longest in over a year) I had to quarantine for 4 days and justified weed to help get through the boredom, and of course it didn’t stop after the quarantine. Until my trip, where I now have to quarantine again. 

Just proud of myself for staying sober. I’ve had a ton of fights with my mom while I’ve been here, before I got more mad that I had to travel when I didn’t want to and it got me sick, and then yesterday she had to put down her dog of 13 years, the first 6 of which I lived at home still while in high school/into college. I loved that dog. And in august I lost my own dog in an accident… fuck man

I’m feeling A LOT lately and have been extremely restless today and yesterday. I’ve been keeping myself busy through most of this but the boredom is weighing on me, but that’s just part of the process.

It's pretty insane how my perspective has changed over the last week. I got covid and am locked inside quarantining with family for Christmas (blessing in disguise). On day 1, 2, and 3 I was itching for weed ... almost ordered delivery from the dispensary (which my whole family would have seen come to my house - not a good look), and I also was texting my buddy asking him to drop off weed at my house. Thankfully he was high and fell asleep before he saw my texts that night lol. 

Few days later I'm so happy to have made it through the first days. I've regained an excitement for the future, and my anxiety levels are way down.

2021-12-27 12:19:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rps9bb/one_week_abstinence_observations/,One week abstinence observations,"Decided to put the pipe down for good a little over a week ago after several consecutive months of almost daily usage and, prior to that, several years of off-on heavy usage. A few observations:

\-Physical symptoms were fairly minor. Felt the occasional malaise (almost as if I was motion sick), although it’s difficult to discern if it was related to withdrawal or something else. That feeling went away after a few days.

\-Insomnia was something I struggled with much of my adult life, so it was no surprise I initially had a few days sleeping for no more than a couple hours straight. That said, the last few nights I slept better than expected. I wake up more rested and less groggy. I used to combat the grogginess with several cups of coffee in the morning. Now I’m finding I need very little caffeine to get me going, a cup at best. Need to remember to make less in the morning or switch to tea.

\-Lost some weight from inadvertently skipping meals because I just don’t think about food that much. This was also normal for me beforehand though as I was never a heavy set guy.

\-Anxiety was terrible at first, but has dissipated a bit over the last few days to a more manageable level. Stress is a normal part of adult life, so I feel like my anxiety could be approaching baseline.

\-Emotions have been all over the place. I feel myself going from one extreme to another fairly rapidly. These emotional fluctuations HAVE NOT dissipated much at all. I think this will be something I will deal with for a while.

\-My head is still ""foggy"".

\-Yesterday was the first day I felt a little bored and unsure what to do with myself at night. My kid was in bed (when I would typically smoke up) and I had no desire to watch TV, play video games or do whatever else I used to turn my brain off to. This was the closest I felt temptation, but didn’t necessarily have cravings. I just browsed stupid corners of the internet until I felt tired enough to go bed.

Given the above, overall I feel great. I spent the majority of the days working, spending time with the wife or playing with my son, who was excited to share with me all his new Christmas toys. While I never previously smoked up before spending time with him, there were times where I was just going through the motions until it was time for him to go to bed, so then I could go escape into my haze. Now if feels that I’m more engaged and “present” with him the whole time, which feels great and vitally important to me for our relationship. Without going into unrelated details, I had a father who spent very little time with me when I was young, which I struggled with a lot. I fear repeating that pattern with my own kids.

One more somewhat strange observation. I casually mentioned to my wife yesterday (who doesn’t smoke) that I stopped and she seemed surprised and asked why. I explained that I felt my use was escalating from a simple relaxation tool to escape, and I was finding myself struggling to juggle cravings with my responsibilities in life. She kind of just shrugged and said ok. I’m not sure what I what I was expecting her reaction to be, but it surprised me that she didn’t seem like she had concerns about my behavior when I was using. This makes me wonder if pot-fueled paranoia may have affected my perception of how I was managing my relationships. I do hope this doesn’t affect my long-term abstinence goals (i.e., I could probably convince myself in moments of weakness that if my wife was ok with me smoking, what’s the harm with it?), but I’m fairly confident that I can remain focused on the fact that I’m simply a better person and, more importantly, a better father without it.",2

I know the alcohol is partially to blame, but I don't know why I'd do that. Smoking weed in this apartment could get me arrested and puts my flatmates at risk (they are my best friends and helped me through recovery). It just makes no sense.

I wish I could thank every one of you individually.

With the new year coming (cliche ik) I figured now would be a great time to make plans for the future as in to start taking care of myself. 

My mental health has never been great but holy shit it’s now become a runaway train with no brakes. Seriously the depression and anxiety gets so bad it’s almost easier to convince yourself something else is wrong because well that’s what it feels like.

I’ve scared myself into worrying I have diabetes, with poor health care and an ailing support system the only thing I can do is wait until im 18 to get everything checked out mentally and physically. It took me a while but I figured until my birthday come September I NEED to take care of myself better.

I’m going on a diet and I’ve developed a workout regimen mainly to see if it’s my sugar not solely for weight loss since one of my problems since I quit has been losing weight. And if it is, at least I’ll be managing it, meaning I’m not damaging my body that much. 

Im going to sleep at a reasonable time no matter what anyone says. I’m gonna put some effort into school. I hate homeschooling it just doesn’t work for me and never has, but this is a promise to myself that I’m going to learn SOMETHING this year.

I’m going to start on my first movie script! It’s always been a dream of mine. And I now know the sky is the limit!!

This is kind of long. But I’m typing this as a reminder that you have to put in work to see results. And as inspiration to anyone who feels just as lost as I do. Here’s to hope and hard work. 

You got this!!!!! We’re in this together!!!",21

I was miserable and was trying to console myself/get my spirits up.  
It had the opposite effect. The more I smoked the more miserable I felt.  
Coupled with some financial hardships that was the last kick I needed to kick a 15-year old habit.  


The first three days were hell. I don't think I had it as bad as some of the people who post here, but I definitely suffered. The mental unrest was the worst for me. It legit felt like a storm was raging in my head, I thought I'd never feel ""calm"" again. I couldn't enjoy anything, was constantly on edge. I was ready to start again at any moment just not to feel like that.

&#x200B;

But my partner and this sub pulled me through and kept me on the path.  
Friday we had a tiny Christmas get-together with the in-laws (with whom we have a great rapport) and it really helped get my mind off things for a few hours as well.  
Ever since this weekend I'm feeling noticeably calmer, and my pleasure in former activities is slowly returning. I've been able to play some games for a few hours while genuinely having some fun. Hadn't been able to do that without smoking for over a goddamn decade.  


I still feel the cravings now. Especially when confronted with frustration; it's like a reflex. ""Damn, this makes me feel bad. Gotta have a took to bring my mood back up"".   
Yeah, no. I kicked a cellar door to pulp at my lowest point during the week, instant regret ofc. But it was still better than a relapse.  


One of the main things that I've realized is that I'm already slightly happier because I'm now much closer to the person I \*want to be\*. I had realized for a decent while my smoking was making my life (and that of my loved ones) worse, not better, but I didn't really want to think it through too much. But anyone who doesn't live up to their own internal ideas of how they should be is bound to be unhappy. I feel like I really finally managed to cast off those shackles.  


My loved ones are also proud of me and offer a lot of support. If you have anyone in your life who would support you, let them know. It makes a world of difference.  
Lots of your tips and love have helped me this past week. Now I hope at least some of what I wrote can help you, especially if you're just starting out and having trouble seeing light at the end of the tunnel.

I posted yesterday and was blown away by the outpour of support. I wanted to jot down what all I was feeling, and I figured I might as well do it here so others on this journey have an opportunity to relate.

I wanted to quit all on my own, and not tell anyone I know personally. I changed my mind pretty quickly, and told my mom. Her response was, ""You're not addicted to weed. You're pretty responsible with it."" This is coming from a woman who took me at the age of 15 to see her sister in intensive care after a horrible accident relating to drug use- and told me, ""if you start using drugs, you'll end up like her!"" I appreciate that my mom doesn't compare me to her addict sister anymore, but I also felt dismissed when I said I wanted to quit and she didn't seem to think I needed to.

I had the same conversation with my boyfriend. He was supportive, but the first thing he said was, ""I quit before and I didn't have any trouble. You'll be fine!"" I felt pretty dismissed here, too, like it was a bad idea to bring it up. I felt bad for struggling. My boyfriend had a very stable life- I have not. I have only recently stopped feeling major symptoms of PTSD due to therapy and medication, which is what has inspired me to quit smoking. I want to make sure I am really dealing with my problems. Last night, even though I smoked a bowl 8 hours before I fell asleep, I had an intense trauma dream. Pot dulls these dreams so much, and I'm terrified of what dreams will be like sober. He knew I had an awful dream, which I told him might have been due to being sober for the first night in years. He didn't agree; he said pot probably had nothing to do with it. I just feel completely misunderstood and like I shouldn't have opened up about quitting, my nightmares, my anxieties, or anything, really...

I've cried a few times today. I'm not even totally sure why. I'm really nervous to go to sleep again. I don't want another bad dream. A user here suggested I read a book, so I started one, and I felt pretty peaceful while reading. I'll go back to it soon. I feel lucky to have this community to help me through this. I feel like such a loser for making such a big deal about this, when the people in my life seem to think it's not hard nor a big deal or that I'm even an addict at all. Instead of relying on them to understand, I think I'm going to keep to this sub and the discord to help me through this.

Thanks for reading, and thanks to this sub for existing. It's so great to have a place to get it all out. Everyone who commented on my post yesterday made me feel so much more secure in quitting. I already love this place and all of you. Gonna chew on a few cinnamon toothpicks and try to distract myself some more!",14

I haven't set up my classes or anything yet, but I have actual tears streaming down my face right now. I feel like I've  accomplishing more in the past 3 weeks than I have in 3 fucking years.

I'm 22 now and I wasted the last 5 years of my life high on drugs, specifically the one always holding me back was cannabis.

My dreams, my goals... Everything feels like it finally falling into place. I'm supposed to call and contact people tomorrow about moving to a new place to live.. and the amount of motivation and support I have for myself is incredible.

Guys.. life is so fucking worth it again.. I feel like I'm just getting high of bettering myself (no joke).. the life I was living before was a mess.. Fueled primarily by depressed and anxious thoughts... And contained within a fucked up life style.

I'm finally getting a good grasp on what I want to do in life and how I'm going to do it.. 

Wish me luck guys, I know this won't be easy.. but there is no turning back now.. I only see a good future ahead of me... Quitting cannabis is the best thing I've ever done. Period.

I hope someone reading this can get some sort of motivation.. if you are stuck in a hole... and just can't find your way out.. know that I've been there and I promise once the rain finally stops pouring down.. and you can grab onto some solid edges... What lies outside of that hole is magical.

I hope everyone has a good night. Thanks to everyone who has helped me on this journey. I love you all.",6

I can say that my appetite is back and I’m eating a lot without getting sick. Sleeping 8-10 hours easily. Still getting night sweats but nothing terrible.

I’m writing this because I don’t know how I feel. Haha that was weird to write. Im laying in bed trying to understand if I’m happy. Or if I’m sad. Or if I’m “normal”. It’s crazy to think I’ve smoked so much over the years that now I can’t understand my true feelings. It’s kind of freaking me out. 

Does anyone understand that feeling? Not knowing how you feel? Or how to figure out how you feel? 

Like is this just the new normal? Is this how normal people feel all day? I hope that makes sense. 

I don’t even know if I’m proud for making it this far. When I think back on the decision to quit, it seems so small and easy a thing to do that I shouldn’t feel proud. Like tying your shoes. Yea I did it, but was it really that impressive? I guess it’s just my lack of confidence or self hate or something. Why should I be proud of something billions of people have no issue with? 

Maybe I’m just empty right now. Lost the woman I love and the drug I loved and now have nothing? I have friends and family I’ve been hanging out with regularly, but it just feels all so blah. Not sad. Not happy. Just is.

Now it’s been every 4-5 days. I keep saying to myself “just don’t do it, it’s not worth it, you will feel like shit” but then after about 3 days the cravings really eat away at me. It’s been about 4-5 days now since I last smoked and I’m vowing right now to not give in. I HAVE to think about this baby. I HAVE to not be selfish. 

Before getting pregnant I knew that weed had such a negative hold on me. My psych kept saying it was making my mental health worse. So I cut down and I felt better… 

But now that I have to give it up entirely for awhile I’m going crazy. Will I ever stop craving this drug? Will I ever just not touch it again? My husband smokes and it’s something we did together but now I miss that bonding time.

It took a very short period of time to go from ""Just to get me to sleep through the pain"" to smoking the second i woke up and all day. My tolerance was much lower so the first 8th lasted me 3 weeks. But by the end of August, it was only lasting me a week at most. I started to cut down again, and then found out i would be receiving a big surgery in October. As an addict does, i continued to use my medical issues as an excuse. After my surgery, the pain was intense and took a lot of aftercare that was very boring. Weed helped, i wont lie. But still, i knew i needed to quit. 

&#x200B;

During the lead up to my surgery, i met somebody new. They sparked something in me that i couldn't have imagined. Since i started smoking 6 years ago, I have lacked a lot of desire. I had goals sure, but never really did anything about it. Multiple partners in that time, and most of them were stoners. My last and longest one, actively encouraged and enabled my smoking, often times avoiding spending time with me if i was in the process of quitting or cutting back. This new partner does edibles and drinks occasionally, But is encouraging me to quit for myself. And the weirdest thing, they are igniting a desire in me i haven't had in years. Im starting my Projects, im pursuing my goals. Currently at 11 days Sober and while the cravings are INSANE at the moment, i promised them i would keep going and that is holding me together. I feel so much stronger than i did before. 

&#x200B;

I don't mean this to be a ""you need to be in love to quit"" or anything. But i do think you need to have a desire and a strong reason. I had plenty of reasons but no desire. And there was never any real consequence for me if i failed. Now, if i failed, they would be disappointing and i deeply desire not to do that to them.",5

It may help someone, who has struggles in terms of quitting that 'shit'.

My personality is all about being a so-called 'good guy' although a lot of friends say I'm more looking like a fuckboy for whatever reason. On the one hand I'm truely a very open-minded and honest person. On the other hand, for the most part of my life, I was very shy and did not talk a lot to strangers or people in general. It felt like I have nothing to say, maybe my brain was full of self-critisim which was a also a reason why my self-esteem got very low. Don't get me wrong, I liked conversations but only with people I'm warm/familiar with. In this way I felt like my conversation partner knows how my words are meant and misunderstandings are avoided. I just focused on my studies, work, a couple of good friends and my fam. I'm convinced to say my parents did a good job by raising me with some moral values and smoking was definetely a no-go although It would be even better to get some clarification about drugs in relation to how they work, what they cause etc.
Just to know what they really are and work and stuff.

By the age of 22 (25 now) I was at a party and I randomly smoked a cigarette just to get this feeling every smoker is talking about. It changed something within me and I know it. It changed my attitude towards life, it changed my mindset by the point to say come on its just a little cigarette how can this be so bad.. 
I did my things as before but without that focus I was into. Everything felt like a routine and even I was sometimes surprised about the way my mind has  changed.

Someday I tried weed and from this point on I was hooked. At first, all that self-critism and that low self-esteem I have talked about earlier was completely gone. I lived my life from a different perspective and it gave my chills everytime. It teached me that nothing on this world is right or wrong. It is all about how you see it. 

I got so much into new people (mixed potheads/non potheads) and these conversations I went through help me a lot to feel happy, geniuely happy.
I had no problems to talk to women, strangers etc. anymore, in case I was not directly smoking shortly before.
I knew nobody is perfect, everyone has its own problems and quirks. My world view changed in a positive manner.
At the end of the day, time passes and you and only you are responsible to your actions.

Sometime passed and I felt really good, only thing that really fucked me up was the fact that I sneaked into more and more smoking weed. By smoking weed I mean crazy haze strains. By this time my tolerance level was enormous high. My whole day was all about thinking when I can get high again and chillout to get those feelings that nothing really matters and everything is fine. 

Nothing is fine, smoking is not good for your health and not really meaningful when you do sports 2-3 times a week. Smoking cigarettes makes you age faster aswell and its overall addictive. Not to mention all the time you thinking about getting high or financial aspects. My head felt really foggy and I was not living, I was just exisitng. I wanted to change. I knew I can be very very productive do more  without this type of substances. I REALIZED I WILL ALWAYS STAY UNDER MY POTENTIAL, not to mention what beautiful things I would do and think if I was completely sober. Maybe I should say that personally I reflect a lot about my do's and don'ts. I smoked heavy that I needed to stop it. Cold Turkey. So here I'm.. it is Day 6, I'm still sober and so grateful for this experience  and all. I feel like a new person. My mind is so clear like ocean's water. I can think without any doubts, without any filters. Just me being human, an individual on this planet. 

I'm now focused more on my family, work, university and my health. Being grateful about every day I'm healthy and paying more attention about little things in life takes me fast in a good mood. There is something about it, I can't really explain. I mean, you can't understand me if you didn't go through this. It is like explaining colors to a blind person.

Now I got that energy and experience I really needed to live my life without the feeling I got miss anything. I take that energy, that input, I always had but now I put it in a better way.. for a better, healthy, long and happy life! 
Self-insight is one of the best things we humans have.

Oh and women are paying more attention to me by the benefits of quitting smoking (smell, skin, healthy lifestyle etc., Especially to have the will-power to change for the good)

My message/question for you is to think about it, is it really worth that short, insignificant moment to get the dopamine kick by smoking?  Or would you rather get a permanent dopamine release by improving your own life?

Maybe my little story can help someone to stay sober or someone can even relate to this by feeling the same. Sorry for my bad english, but I think you got that point.

Stay strong. Stay healthy

to forgive myself, but I surely won't forget. I hope I will continue to remember and learn from this entire
experience so it does not happen again. I will encounter more situations, especially in college, where I might get offered to try, to taste, to fly... I just need to be prepared for whatever comes in my
way. I read somewhere in a book that said, ""The road to happiness is making goals."" So here are
mine for 2022.
1. Be a year sober
2. Survive pandemic (season 3!)
3. Read 1-2 books a month
4. Get accepted to my #1 choice of nursing school
5. Maintain healthy lifestyle + continue weight loss
6. Learn how to budget

These goals seem practical (if I put in the effort) and accomplishing these and many more will be THE high of all highs.

I'm quitting pot again. Wish me luck!,"Over the past two years, I acquired two nasty daily habits: smoking pot, and drinking wine. Last September, I decided to stop both. It was difficult, but I did manage to quit and life was good. My mind was clear, I was sleeping well, had energy.

I started seeing a guy a couple of times a week, and he offered to smoke pot when we chilled. I thought it would be fine, because I was not purchasing it. It worked OK in the beginning. Getting high twice a week was weird because it would hit me hard and be paranoid and anxious, but my tolerance went back up progressively.

After a few weeks of that, I started craving pot daily again. One day, he couldn't buy any, and suggested we just didn't smoke any. I had been craving pot hard, nearly counting the minutes before he'd show up and we'd smoke. I offered to buy some at the dispensary. That was the turning point. For the last month, I have found every excuse I could to go to the dispensary every two days. Bad news at work, feeling tired, whatever, every reason was good to smoke.

Was it fun? You'd think doing drugs would be fun, but not really. All my usual issues came back as if I had never quit. I am coughing again, I smell like an ashtray, I have to carefully schedule dates, friends visits, outings, around pot. I can't sleep without pot anymore. I'm irritable when I am not high, and I smoke throughout the day. Also, my face is puffy and I always look like I just woke up from a nap.

Yesterday morning I ran out of pot, and that night could not sleep. I fell asleep at 6AM and woke up at 9AM. I waited anxiously for 1PM for the dispensary to open. When I got there, there was a massive line of people waiting. It convinced me to quit.

I'm not standing in the freezing cold for an hour to buy a plant that is destroying my life. This is BS. I did my groceries instead and bought my favorite ice cream. Wish me luck!",123
2021-12-26 12:59:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rp23tz/goodbye_my_old_friend/,Goodbye my old friend….,"Today is the day to finally leave weed alone for good. I started smoking weed when I was 18, it started so innocently. My best friend at the time was gifted a joint from his step dad as a graduation present (we were graduating high school) my friend immediately told me and we planned to smoke it that night at my house. My friend had smoked plenty by this point but this was going to be the first time I ever tried weed. I thought it changed my life. That smoke was the most amazing smoke and really opened my mind up but then I thought I needed weed always and my addiction began to spiral out of control. I thought it was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, made food better, made movies and music better, made talking with friends better, made work easier, made driving easier, made even the littlest thing easier but that’s obviously far from the truth. 

Shortly after trying weed with my friend I was buying ounces and would always have a ounce on me. Daily smoker for 5 years straight, 2 of those years was 3.5 grams of wax a week on top of my ounces of bud which isn’t a lot to some but I’m 23 now and feel like ages 18-23 just came and gone. Being a stoner became a part of my personality. I considered myself a high functioning stoner and that help mask my addiction for awhile. 

I met my now wife in 2019. She was already a stoner when I met her but I increased both our addictions by always having ounces, wax and weed to smoke on hand. A lot of our early bonding came through weed and smoking weed seems like such a core part of us and our relationship. I love smoking a bong with my wife and then talking all about our days or this wild idea. I feel so strongly about those memories that it actually makes me start to cry. I feel like I’m losing a loved one in weed. The thought of actually leaving weed makes me want to cry, it makes me deeply sad and unsure of if it’s the right decision to give up my and my wife’s favorite pastime. 

I want to give weed up because I can finally feel the negative effects it’s having on me. I can’t focus, I can’t control my emotions, I can’t remember anything long or short term. I can’t figure what I was about to say and memories that I do remember are hazy and slowly fading. I can feel that it’s made me a much less sharper person. I used to be so sharp, best memory and could remember so much but now my brain is so foggy sometimes I have a hard time figuring out what if anything I should be doing. I’ve got to get my old self back. I’m making this post to be held accountable and to also vent.

It just feels like it’s been such a big part of me for so long that today when my girlfriend packed the bong (which is something I usually do) to smoke by herself it made me break down and cry for 10 minutes straight. The pain of leaving weed, I wanted to smoke so bad with her this morning, the thought of moving on and not experiencing that bong smoke with her, man it hit me hard. But I want my life back, I want myself back, I really want my memory back and while it was a good time and significant part of my life it’s time to move on and quit. I’m quitting weed today. My wife said she wants to finish smoking the current ounce we have and then she will quit with me. I told her to go ahead and smoke it without me, I can’t put this off any longer. I can’t go another day with a foggy brain saying in the back of my head that I need to quit. I can’t thank this sub enough, hearing that people actually get their memory and mind back is very inspiring. Cheers to the new year that is approaching, which I will for the first time in 5 years be entering sober. Much love and good vibes and energy to everyone. If you took the time to read all of this, thank you.",11
2021-12-26 12:52:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rp1z20/here_i_am_again/,"Here I am, again","I had been an ""on and off"" smoker ever since college (~15 years), between school and a few different jobs I was never comfortable enough to commit to smoking full-time.

That changed late last year, as a combination of the pandemic, working from home, and general political anxiety (US election) came to a head. From October 2020 through July 2021 I smoked all day, every day. I was spending a few hundred per month on weed, and managed to develop a love for expensive iced coffees at the same time. 

I only stopped because I had a significant anxiety episode one night in late July. I couldn't sleep, because I couldn't stop thinking about all of my family members dying and how sad life would be without them and how much time I had wasted being high around them. I sought help immediately, sobered up, talked to a therapist through my work, practiced meditation, and slowly got better. I was even able to cope with the actual death of my grandfather relatively well during my sober period.

I got so much better, in fact, that a few weeks ago I decided to give smoking another shot. ""I'll only smoke during the weekends, or at night"" is what I told myself. Soon enough I was back to my old ways, being high almost every minute I possibly could.

Well, I had another anxiety episode on Christmas Eve. Couldn't sleep, thinking about everyone dying again. When I woke up I dumped what I had left. We didn't see extended family because of COVID concerns, and I was dealing with my ""withdrawal"" as well. Having the mindset of ""I've wasted so much time"" while also not being able to see family made for a depressing holiday.

I remember a time when I was an avid r/trees user and would scoff at the idea of r/leaves. ""It isn't even addictive, how could it make people want to quit"" I recall thinking. And now here I am. I let weed become a major part of my personal identity, and maybe that was my critical mistake. I'm pretty sure I started smoking weed because it was cool, but it just isn't that cool to me anymore. Especially if it comes with or exacerbates bouts of anxiety and depression. 

Anyways, that's about it. I'm back to being sober and looking forward to getting past this and never looking back. I wish everyone else on here the best of luck, and hope that you can find and achieve what you are looking for.",7

I started smoking about 6 years ago when I was 16, when I was younger I always had some interest to try it so obviously when the opportunity came to me I took it. I started smoking maybe once a week when I gathered with my group of friends, then quickly I started to buy for myself and it turned into a everyday thing.

I never thought of weed as bad thing, even though I smoked everyday and went to basically every class high, my grades were never off. I could socialize normally and I can even say that I met great people and had great experiences because of it.

Now I'm almost 22 and I decided to stop a few months ago because I would just not get the ""good high"" anymore...Instead I would just start panicking, whenever I smoked it was like a million thoughts ran trough my head and my heart just started racing. It was like everytime I smoked I had a panic attack or something similar. I don't know why but the only way I could get high was if I got drunk first, wich I started doing everytime I was going to smoke.

Because of this I decided to stop smoking, it wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. I had really bad first week, anxiety trough the roof, couldn't eat and only wanted to lie in bed and sleep. But after that I started to get better day by day. Luckily I don't have the urge to smoke even though I have some spare g's lying on my desk drawer. But I still don't feel 100% normal, there are days that I don't feel like myself and it feels like I'm just doing things on auto-pilot and just feel ""numb"".

Right now I'm almost a the 2 months mark and even though I don't feel 100% I know that I will get there someday, started to do some exercise, stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol. Step by step I'll get there. If there's any other advice you guys can give me it would be appreciated.",5

But I broke up with my ex after 5 years. I smelled something is wrong, thought it's just a leaf propelled anxiety, but it turnd out to be whole world collapsing on me. Today is the first time I felt less sad and I felt comfortable enough to again think about my future, working on myself, improving my body, maybe actually finding someone who will love me for who I am. 

And then I felt urge to take the leaf and smoke it. The fact I had it in my drawer didn't help but if I didn't have it I'd just buy it.

I rolled it. Smoked the tip of it. Felt instant regret, anger, my ego telling me to fuck off from it, my conscious telling me to do the right thing. And I did it, I fucked away from it. I think it's for good this time. 

I conquered it. I won. Maybe it's a small win but it's one of the most proud of my adult life.

it makes my mind foggy

it makes me talk negatively to myself immediately after i smoke it and immediately gives me a feeling of regret

it makes me feel disassociated from the person i truly am

it makes me feel like i am wasting precious time that i could be spending with my family or friends or ANY new people and creating and developing MEANINGFUL relationships

it makes me feel out of touch with my emotions

it makes me feel unproductive

it gives me a sense of comfort that will eventually lead to going nowhere in life

it is preventing me from accomplishing my dreams and goals

it makes me feel dumb and lesser than others

it makes me compare myself to others and forget who i am and the things i’ve accomplished

Im at the point that I’m stuck in this loop of smoking and asking myself why I even smoke. I don’t even enjoy it anymore. It just makes me anxious and foggy and socially awkward, I feel like an idiot trying to form a thought. It wasn’t always like that, I think at this point I’m just using it to cope and it’s lost it’s point for me. I think this years past events and how they’ve effected me have really changed how my body reacts to substance of any kind. 

I started smoking when I was 25, I’m 31 now. I didn’t really get heavy into it until I was like 29 and I started smoking daily, all day. That lasted about a year and I went back to just doing it after work. It’s an absolute crutch, and every time I smoke now I just instantly regret it. 

I’ve been going to the gym, eating well, I’ve been working on my mental health and physical health everywhere. This seems to be my one vice I really don’t understand WHY I keep it around. I convince myself it’s like a “beer after work”……but every day ? Lets be real…. 

My closest friend is of corse a stoner. He smokes all day every day, him and his wife.  It’s just not who I am and I’m tired of identifying with the shit if I’m being honest. I hope it doesn’t change our relationship but if it does it does, I have to think of me. 

I think I’ll just stop today, and next year I’ll give myself the Christmas gift of being one year sober, hopefully in different circumstances and in a totally different spot in life. 

I hope everyone who has quit, has the strength to make it another day. I hope everyone who’s wanting to quit finally finds a way to do.

2 weeks ago me and my partner decided it was time to quit, we had been existing together all year indulging, and it was ripping us apart as we caved further into our own selves.

Safe to say the 2 weeks I've had this year of not smoking weed have been the best of the year. I will not blame the weed, it was me that chose to indulge in it. I love waking up feeling ready to smash the day, with a clear mind and full heart. 

I'm 24 and if I've learnt anything in life it's that as I get older decisions become more expensive inward, time is ticking and a week or a month of withdrawals is more worthwhile than a lifetime full of regret and hope that things will change instead of being the change that is going to keep you moving forward.

I don't even know if I'm ever going to smoke again, soon or in the future. I feel happy and proud, but also scared because if I relapse it's going to be a LOT more depressing than relapsing after 1 month (my last record).

Nobody in my real life knows how important is this anniversary for me. It's hard to find a person who truly understands how difficult is to quit weed.",2
2021-12-26 08:35:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rox1r0/moments_of_clarity_2/,Moment[s] of Clarity 2,"Hey there everyone. This is my second post of this sub. I’ve been smoking regularly for 7 years now, I started on my 20th birthday (June 2014). I was very opposed to drugs and alcohol before that time and was vocal about my disdain for it. I had never tried anything until I turned 20. But once I had weed for the first time it really changed my view on it, I was instantly hooked. There was NO thought process with it, and smoking any chance I could was first thing on my mind. It’s sad to say I switched up on myself so quick like that, looking back at least. 

However, November of this year I had the longest break from weed I’ve had in these 7 years. It felt like the longest month I’ve had in those 7 years. In a good way. Admittedly I had weed occasionally in November but it was mostly if a friend was smoking. But I stayed away from the dispensary. I know staying away from weed and especially alcohol is what I know I need to do and will only be positive for myself and loved ones. 

Weed really makes me a selfish person. I tend to only smoke alone and will hide weed for myself. Same goes for alcohol, too. I’m the type of drinker that will sneak to the kitchen when my friends are over to take a few extra sips after doing shots with them. And will drink to just make that feeling greater, until I’m out of control. 

I’ve learned I’m really struggling with self control, and I feel like we all can relate to that on this sub. 

But something I’ve come to realize this month. Is that it takes more effort and energy for me to go out of my way to buy weed at the dispensary than it takes for me to choose NOT to. It might take a lot of will power to not preorder some weed through my phone, but it’s in my hands to choose a healthier life. I’ve spent so much of my adult life high, and it feels like a blur.

I’m going to make next year my first year sober in these past 7. I know it will only impact my life positively and that should be enough for me to want to change. I’m holding myself accountable from now on.",3

I have been smoking for the best part of my 20s non stop. I always figured I could stop later until I found myself impossible to stop.
I managed though and now I have been clean for 17 days.
What has changed? Nothing really, just see my problems with more clarity, but they are far from solved. Stopping smoking weed didn’t really change my life, I’m still the guy I was while getting high. I need to do a lot of self improvement and work hard cause weed wasn’t the source of my problems.
But one big difference I noticed is that I’m emotionally much more balanced. And this makes a huge difference for me. I recently found out my ex gf is getting married, the one I thought was the one, and I know that if I was smoking weed I would have been destroyed, but I’m not. And this is fucking awesome.
I still feel the urge to smoke from time to time and my brain tries to trick me into thinking that is just one joint, how bad could it be? But I know I have to stay strong and the longer I stay clean the stronger I become.
To all of you that are suffering because of this, don’t surrender, it is worth it.
Thank you all for this amazing group and support. It really helped my in the hardest of moments.
I still have a long path in front of me but will cross it with the best of intentions and knowing that I can make it. I am much better without weed and the same is true for you.
Until the next post, stay strong guys! Thank you!",8

Idek why I smoke anymore, I smoked the fun out of it. I’m not even smoking to get high anymore I’m smoking to forget the way I feel now and every time I smoke I feel like shit. Not sick well sometimes a little sick but mostly I just feel like an addict. I have a child now I need to be present and I’m not anymore. Physically yes but I’m detached from reality constantly because I smoke 24/7 and have for a long time, I quit while I was pregnant but same thing before that I smoked basically 24/7, even before and at work. I feel like a slave to the drug, I don’t think it’s a bad drug but I feel like I am not the right hands for it anymore. I feel nauseous when I don’t smoke, I dramatically lost weight because I’m not eating properly and my appetite is all fucked up. I can usually only eat decent a amount of food when I’m high, otherwise I won’t eat for days purely because food made me nauseous until I smoked. It doesn’t feel fun anymore. I want to be sober and to feel things normally but I’m high 24/7 so I don’t even actually remember who I am. I just can’t do it anymore. I have tried to quit so many times though and said that exact thing and felt this exact way and could never do it long term let alone on my own. I’ve smoked for about 5 years quitting twice I think for around 6 months each time with my partner, we stopped at the same time so it was easier not having it in the house. I barely cook meals anymore for my partner and I because I can’t be bothered.. I look unhealthy, my skin is dull and my hair won’t grow much, I don’t really socialise anymore, my anxiety is 10x worse than it’s ever been. I‘ve sad “this will be the last cone” and “no smoking tomorrow and from now on” I recon about 30 times and smoked immediately the next day. I hate myself for allowing it to run my life.
I can’t do anything without smoking, it’s ridiculous..
So, I really really hope this time is it. That this will be the time I can do it for good!",2
2021-12-26 07:14:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rovtx8/day_54_it_gets_easier/,Day 54 - It gets easier.,"I'm turning 30 next year and I started smoking when I was 16. I've never attempted to quit previously and I'm 54 days sober today. Weed was such a big part of my identity my friends and cousins used to nickname me by calling me Snoop or Wiz Khalifa lol due to the sheer amount I smoked and I never let a day pass by without smoking (only if the plug was dry). 

I was thinking there's no way I can just quit, what the hell would I do without it? What's there to look forward to after a stressful day? All of these questions were from the lil addiction monster inside me and I had to realise that BILLIONS of people go through life without weed and a alot of them are in a much worse situation than me. 

The first 2 weeks were rough I'm not going to lie - mood swings, low appetite, night sweats, vivid nightmares to name a few. But after that things just naturally got better and each day after that it gets easier. 

My mind started to focus on staying sober rather than getting high, my relationships improved because I started spending more time with people I cared about, my thinking became alot clearer and I'm able to process emotions without needing a spliff to enjoy good times and run away from bad times. My dreams are now wonderful and I look forward to them every night. I've saved a shit ton of money and I'm buying things that I've always wanted. I smashed a job interview and got a massive promotion recently. I dont think any of this would be possible if I was still constantly dazed.

I won't lie I'm still at the beginning of this journey and there's alot I need to improve on like working out, building better habits to pass my time etc but my mindset has changed and thats all now a possibility for me whereas before I would've considered it impossible and not worth the time and effort.

In these last 5 years I've had many changes of mindset towards smoking weed, and I've even quit several times. Longest period was 4 and a half months. I relapsed because I was able to enjoy it again, and if it's enjoyable it's reaaally enjoyable, but I'm that type of person that get's addicted real quick, an all or nothing kind of guy.

So here we are again, at the stage of being miserable thanks to my weed abuse. I never did anything to f\*ck my life up while I was smoking weed, but didn't really take any action aswell. And it's come to a point that i'm just doubting myself, if I'm even still capable of taking action to live my life and make progress.

I live a good life, have a nice job, a nice car, a good physique, .. but I (and many others) expected so much more of me when I was younger because there was so much potential. And now I feel empty, like there's no potential left so I better just enjoy the life I got and not give a fuck while I still can. 

Right now, i've only been sober for 26 hours and I'm really battling myself not to go get some weed. My thoughts are: ""just enjoy it once more to get rid of the bad thoughts you're feeling now and start fresh"". I know that's just BS, but i'm quite convincing to myself about these kind of things..

I'm filling up a hot bath which I will try to enjoy with a glass of cranberry juice in a few minutes, in hopes that I will have cleared my mind of the negative thoughts pushing me towards weed again. It would also be really great, if by the time I finish my bath, I can read some comments or participate in a conversation about the good things that will come my way once I get rid of my addiction

I'm sorry if I bring a negative vibe to the table and I hope it doesn't affect anyone. But creating this post already helped me calm my mind a bit.",8

If not for my brain convincing me at the last moment I’m having a psychotic episode or that smoking so much caused me to develop or brought out schizophrenia.

I know it’s most likely withdrawals so you don’t even have to reply. But it’s so scary to feel you’re not in control. Or for something to be happening to you that you’re not aware of.

I’ve read some literature and findings about the relationship between marijuana and schizophrenia and it just sent me into overdrive.

Sorry this turned more into a rant than anything else. But posting here truly helps. And the only way I’m going to be able to get over this is if I tell myself it’s withdrawals which it probably is.

The indicators that the logical side of my brain threw out:

1. You’re aware that something is wrong/off/or different as in people in those states usually can’t tell something is wrong 

2. You’re only 17 and you’re still changing as a person physically and mentally 

3. You’re still withdrawing, it hasn’t even been a month 

4. Lastly I’m sure it’s just anxious part of my brain trying to justify why I feel this way. Grasping onto every change I notice and twisting it into something sinister. 

Withdrawals and google go together like a 3rd grader pressing the same charges of magnets together.",9

Pros are: not dependent on weed anymore, no more weed anxiety or depression side effects.

Cons: I’m actually not pleased that I can’t smoke my herb.

I'm broke at the moment because I had a lot of bills this last month and I lost my job in November so all my savings are tapped out. I felt trapped because I couldn't do anything, everything was closed anyways, but I didn't have the slightest option.

I stocked up on dry and frozen foods so I was able make a decent meal, thank God for that! I organized everything in my room ; my closet, my documents, went through every drawer and tossed out all the random things in there.

Some would say that was a productive day, but I felt this loneliness all day! Like I didn't have anyone at all!! If I knew where to get weed from I would have definitely went for it! 

A friend of mine who I used to smoke with - he quit about a year ago - came over with cigars and whiskey, we had a couple drinks, watched some TV, and he even ordered a pizza for the both of us.

He definitely saved my night, I would have gone crazy!!

2021-12-26 01:42:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rordbk/1_year/,1 year,"I quit last Christmas, but somehow it feels like a lifetime ago. While the first few weeks and months were tough, I’m now in such a completely different head space. Very, very few and only weak cravings, clear head, better memory, I’m more present for everyone in my life. Anxiety has improved, I have a better handle on all my emotions.

When I was a heavy smoker for years, I dreaded running out SO much. It felt like -without weed - happiness was sucked from my life, how was I supposed to enjoy anything not being high? But then I also didn’t enjoy many things being high either. Mainly liked being alone and not doing much at all.

Before I quit, I cut down. I’d also take a lot of mini breaks where I’d let myself run out for 2-3 weeks at a time. Felt the withdrawal effects (bad mood, bad sleep) and eventually caved every time. But I think in some way it desensitised me to the whole withdrawal process where I wasn’t dreading it as much. I also really experienced this weird: “want to be high when I’m sober & as soon as I’m high I want to be sober again” thing.

Not sure I’d recommend this over just quitting but in some way I think it helped me to ramp down, familiarise myself with the pain and realise i could take all the breaks I wanted and still be an addict. I have NO moderation with weed, none.

Now, I didn’t have a perfect year. After about 6 months I did smoke with a friend when visiting them. I also smoked with friends about 2 months ago when visiting family. I don’t regret it, although I wish I had the willpower to just pass it up completely. 

I was actually so positively surprised that I had zero cravings after those lapses. I didn’t feel like I needed it back in my life full time which is huge for me. But here’s the key: I can’t have my own stuff. Smoking a joint with someone once in a blue moon  is one thing. I have no moderation so as soon as I’d get my own weed I’d be back at square one.

It’s really hard to quit something we become so accustomed to doing day in and day out. Even if it’s occasional, most habits start out that way but eventually end up becoming routine. Just wanted to put that disclaimer in…

Personally, I remember always being super defensive about my addiction.  I always had excuses and explanations for anything discriminatory concerning weed such as the fact that it’s a gateway drug etc etc. Having been a chronic user of it for 3 solid years, I believe it’s not only a gateway drug but that it’s much worse.

Think well about why it’s be called the devils lettuce for example. Personally before I ever smoked and after I got sober I realized just how bad and pungent it smells. Sure there’s some good effects but on the flip side, many people feel paranoid and anxious after smoking it. Smoking weed led me to doing even harder drugs within a month of trying weed out for the first time. I was an addict and was going through severe depression at the time so as you can imagine this led me down a cycle of making bad decisions for temporary happiness.

I wouldn’t be where I am today hadn’t I finally gathered up the courage to stop being the kind of person that chooses to confront my problems rather than always chasing that next quick fix to avoid feeling anything.

Idk who needs to hear this but you’re a fcking boss! It takes a lot of individual willpower to pull yourself together and do what’s truly in your best interest even if taking that hit is a lot easier. Instead of running towards what you’re used to and repeating the same cycle everyday, you choose to stay woke. You choose to get out of your comfort zone and finally put you and your life first; and let me just say: I’m so fcking proud of you and I believe in you. 

Don’t see the journey of becoming sober as this challenge to maintain or defeat. You’re not at war with anyone else but your past ignorant self, the addict. You’ve turned a new page, you’re not that same individual anymore. Sure, you’ve retained all the lessons from having gone through it but always remember to think of your addict chapter like a learning experience. You just graduated mofo. Go get em’ bxtches!",13

It’s the same thing every time- I’m hanging out with some friends, they’re smoking, I convince myself I can smoke a little just this one time, and then almost instantly I’m back to smoking every morning and staying high all day. There’s never even a ramp-up or anything, it’s just like opening a floodgate. What I’ve realized by now is that there is no “moderation” or “just one time” for me, it’s more of an all or nothing that I can’t really control. Of course, I conveniently forget or ignore this fact every time I decide to smoke again, and at this point it’s almost funny to me how regular this pattern is.

I was expecting a better mood, more energy, more motivation, and when none of that happened other than a more consistent low mood rather than up and down, I ended up right back down the rabbit hole. I’m not worried about smoking again because even with cravings, Iv simply accepted that smoking is not for me, and Iv accepted that it’s potentially even a year of healing before you feel significantly better. Long after the physical effects are gone you are left with lasting psychological effects. At least in my experience. I don’t say that discourage anyone but instead to get started ASAP, don’t put it off just start now so that you can take the needed time to reset emotionally physically spiritually etc. rather than resist by willpower, accept that it’s potentially a longer journey than you thought to fully recover and that you are willing to take that journey. Main issue that’s bothered me as of late is just that I’m a solo artist, & I simply don’t have the creative desire to make music much since I quit. It was my dream to make a career out of it since 2014, and now that Iv quit it’s like Iv lost the fire for my dream too. A big price to pay, but I believe that maybe in time my creativity will come back in a new and better way, or this will lead me to a bigger dream. Either way, I won’t go backwards",15

2021-12-25 19:24:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rol0lb/where_i_found_success/,Where I found success,"41 years old, smoked for 25 of those, and stopped in June 2020

For most of that time I never thought it would stop. Most of the time I was prepared to live out the rest of my life a stoner. I was committed. I grew weed so supply was never a problem. I depended on it for sleep, appetite and regulating my mood.

There were a lot of negative effects, primarily negative emotional / mental effects. Guilt, shame, anxiety, sometimes paranoia and cycles of negative thinking.

I tried to quit multiple times over those years. I tried in 1999, 2004, 2008, 2010 and probably some other less significant attempts I don't recall. Looking back each of those times was destined to fail for a few reasons:

* I was never really prepared
* I had a lot of doubt about my ability to do so
* I couldn't imagine a life without weed
* I had no idea how to cope

Each time I tried it was about getting through the day without smoking weed, maintaining a resistance against weed. I was literally not doing something that deep down I desperately wanted to do.  Sometimes I'd manage to get a week, two or maybe 4 in before something would happen that I would use an an excuse to go back. Many times I'd justify it by saying I would now control my use. That never happened and many times the reverse was true - my use grew worse overtime like I was trying to make up for lost time.

By the time I turned 40 it really hit home that I had watched two decades of my life fly by, stoned, as if I was just an observer on the sidelines and not fully present in my own life. This really played heavy on my  mind. That milestone hit in January and by June I had decided I was going to change. Where and how did I find that success? That success was built on a lot of past failures. It was built on knowledge from communities such as this one. It was built on a strong desire for change. The key factors being:

* I made it my #1 priority in life
* I was determined to find a way to get through
* I planed and prepared, knew and learned what to expect and had a plan to deal with that. Expected the unknown and committed to figure it out on the fly as needed
* Expected to not be feeling very well for a long, long time. Months, if not a year or more
* Cultivated excitement about becoming sober and looked forward to all that it would bring
* Took responsibility for myself, the way I felt, the way I dealt with things and made it my mission to learn new coping skills and strategies to overcome adversaries in life
* Found new things in life that I thoroughly enjoyed and engaged in them
* Talked to a therapist on a pretty regular basis
* Became a more open person about what I was facing to those I loved and trusted
* Put effort into my relationships
* While I already had a pretty respectable exercise regime I intensified it
* I started behaving as if I was a sober person

It worked and I know that I need to keep my guard up to defend my new found freedom from weed and addiction.

In my first attempts you may recognize that I was *white-knuckling* it. Barley hanging on, needing to maintain a resistance. That was not sustainable for me, I believe that no matter how strong a person you will eventually drain that battery and you'll implode. There must be something more, a mindset of acceptance, perseverance, looking to the future and confidence of achieving change in a healthier lifestyle. That's what help bring me to where I am today.

While I appreciate celebrating the milestones of days sober (I don't look at it as days without weed - wrong view/approach in my opinion) its more about just living my new life at this point. Participating in this community has helped me immensely. At first it was sharing my struggles and challenges and now its about sharing my journey and what helped me - with the clarity and  insights that I gained along the way.

Quitting weed (and definitely booze and any other addictive behavior or drug, I'm sure) is really, really hard. It's not impossible though and although I don't know the statistics I wouldn't be surprised if the number of x-stoners is higher than the number of people using who have a problem with weed. Start believing in yourself - you deserve a better life. Don't be afraid of change - change is good when its for the right reason. If you frequent this sub you no doubt have the little voice inside guiding you in that direction already. Give that little voice power and make it big, its right and you know it is :)

At first I switched to dabs/wax, but they were making me feel like crap so I stopped altogether, it's been 3 days since I smoked any form of THC, and over a week since I smoked flower. 

Ever since I stopped smoking flower I haven't been sleeping well at all. At first I thought it was because of the dabs, but it's been 3 nights since I stopped smoking dabs and I'm still not sleeping well. I'm waking up at least 2 times every night, my mouth is dry as hell when I wake up, and I still feel tired no matter how much I sleep. One night I slept 11 hours and still felt exhausted when I woke up. I also have huge bags under my eyes constantly.

Is this normal? I'm not noticing any other side effects, and it's been surprisingly easy to stop. I still have some joints and wax left over and so far I've been able to resist smoking them without much trouble. I'm not sure if I never want to smoke again, but I'm at least taking a few weeks break to see how I feel. 

I'm starting to worry that maybe I have sleep apnea and marijuana was masking it? Is not feeling rested from sleep, waking up multiple times every night, and waking up with a dry mouth normal when you quit marijuana? If so how long does it last?",2
2021-12-25 18:05:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rojkrk/merry_christmas/,“Merry” Christmas,"On Christmas in 2016, my sister bought me a weed pen. This completely changed the game. I went from casual smoking with friends to hitting THC non-stop. 

However, this is the second Christmas where I am not getting high anymore (woohoo!). THC was just too damaging and it heightened anxiety that I knew I had but kept burying.

I spoke to my friend two days ago. He’s currently going through AA. THC and alcohol are two widely different substances. However, the patterns of abuse can be the same. He said something to me that really stuck out:

“If a substance gives you MASSIVE euphoria, that’s a huge red flag.”

He’s totally right. That’s what pot was for me. I’m trying to support his abstinence through advice I garnered from quitting pot. Really looking forward to his transformation. 

And for those who haven’t quit pot yet, I’m truly looking forward to all of your transformations, as well. Your mind changes and the people around you will notice a better person.

I quit pot March 2020. Christmas from 2017-2019 was incredibly depressing because of the THC come-downs. It infiltrates your mind and tricks you to believing that your life is actually shitty and depressing. Watch what quitting can do for you. If you are struggling during quitting, please PM me! I have great advice to share.

It just doesn't wanna taste anything. I can feel all the anger and pain i had numbed down, and not gonna lie, i like it.

I snatched the bong from the toddler whose emotional intelligence is still underdeveloped. It's currently 3:11 am here. I'm pacing the room, sitting on the chair for some minutes, going back to bed to lie down, only to wake up an realise that i cannot fucking sleep. I'm hungry but i dont feel like anything is gonna taste good. I have issues i need to solve. I have plans to make after i graduate college. I have parents to make proud. But instead, I have been blowing smoke. Cause what if i try and fail and everybody starts to know that I'm nothing but a failure? Guess taking the hit and just dreaming would help. But isn't it sad? When the high wears off and you're still in the same position, with a day fully gone or maybe months. In my case, it's 3 years. I have chilled enough. I have relapsed enough, thinking ""I'll stop once things get serious in life"". But my dude, how is life gonna get serious if you yourself are not? 

I was smart as a kid. Would rank in class and get praised by teachers infront of my parents. They had expectations. Everyone still has expectations. I never would have believed as a child that i would become someone like me in the future, who is so afraid of life that she prefers to hide in her room and smoke. I'm tired. I dont care how shitty i have to feel now. I dont care how many months i gotta act like a depressed individual. But I'm not going back to the illusion stuff. 

Weed is not bad, don't get me wrong. Its me who is to be blamed, who took it for her own advantage to numb life down. Weed helps you relax, but weed is never meant for you to cover your issues. Once you do that, you have no right to disrespect weed as the devil. Weed is cool. I am not.",16

All through school I was the guy. Everyone came to me when they first started smoking to find them the jazz cabbage. And I’ve been a full time stoner ever since. We did tons of cool stuff and I had so many adventures. Everything paired with weed great. I never missed a day. I smoked before work, on break, after work, before/after dinner. You name it. Well 2 days ago I decided to take a little break and I feel clear.  What led me to do this is the fact that If I want to land a good job in my field I have to subject myself to drug tests. At random to. Ive seen a lot of people start to move up in life and I just feel like… I’m still just the stoner kid from high school. I used to think I was never good enough to excel in anything. I was always mediocre and I never took a step back to think maybe, just maybe it was the weed? My whole lifestyle? The very thing that I feel defines me? That couldn’t be it right? I have ALWAYS smoked. I’m a successful stoner right? Wrong. I’m always on the brink of disaster with no money and okay credit that leaves me questioning once or twice a year if I will be homeless. Or have to move back in with family. It’s weird but this is all I’ve ever known. I almost feel like a failure because I’m thinking about keeping the pipe down indefinitely since I’ve been abstained for these 2 days. I feel like I’m giving up on the one thing I stuck with.

I quit smoking 11 days ago. I’d been a user for about 10 years, multiple times per day, dabs, flower, and edibles. I was a heavy user. 

In the past month or so I started getting bored of being high all the time, and started to really reflect on my life and how I’ve lost two grandparents in the last couple years that I could’ve spent more time with had I not been so preoccupied with being high all the time. It really started to hit me and the gravity of it all began to give me panic attacks. 

Since quitting I’ve had a depressed mood and some killer anxiety. Maybe it’s all surfacing because I was using weed to repress it all. I’m just curious how long these things tend to last for people during the withdrawal phase of quitting.

For me it's about balancing out the feeling of emptiness with the upside of not smoking. I'm not particularly lazy. In fact, I'm often seen as overactive, and I've come to see smoking as a way to dial it down. Ultimately, it just feels like diminishing returns. 

How do you keep going?",3

I've seen studies that say chocolate has stuff in it that binds to the same cannabinoid receptors in your brain.  Could binging on chocolate basically tell my brain that I'm back to smoking?  And stopping can bring on the same feelings I've had with withdrawl?  

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  I just sucks that I start feeling better, decide to eat some chocolate, and feel like crap afterwards.",1

&#x200B;

I've been thinking really hard about quitting the last few weeks. Once I found this community and read many posts, I felt more motivated than ever to start. 

I have been vaping for the better part of my adult life. Not oil, flower. I put together 6 months clean and sober last year, and my life changed dramatically. At the time, it was the pandemic and I was really on edge. I was going through a divorce, and didn't want that to be used against me plus I felt like that would just be running away from my problems. If anything I needed to focus on them. When I think back to those times, I remember how focused and determined I was. I stopped and never looked back. It was great!!!! I actually read my journal from those times, and I can remember the better quality of life I had. Once life slowed down a little bit, I let it back in and it came back just the way I left it. Fun, then fun with problems, then just problems. Now after a year, I'm having trouble managing the awesome life I set up. I'm reaching a point where if I can get back on track, I can level up a few different key areas of my life. 

It was fun at first, but then I realized that I set everything up the exact same way I did before. I had all these rituals, and I would obsess over them. My boundaries disappeared, and that leads to chaos. 

So I dumped my entire stash. It hurt a lot. a LOT. Everything is gone. I feel alone. I know this is not going to magically solve all my problems either. But I want to find ways to make it work. I want to be bored and figure out what to do with myself. I want better sleep with dreams. I want the second half of my life to be dedicated to keeping my head clear and my mind sharp. 

I just wanted to share with those who may be thinking about their own quit.",14

It's important to recognize that most people don't succeed at everything first time. It's taken a great number of times to rid the hardened habit. What I've learned is that there's a bunch of fun stuff you can do while you're sober. Sometimes, when you're attempting to quit, you think about all the things you'd usually do when using. It's easy to forget that these things don't disappear when you're sober, in fact you find more enjoyment out of them when you have a clearer mind to focus on enjoying the moment! For example, Video Gaming. Just as, or more fun, when you're sober and able to focus on the task at hand.",10

Its been hell. I haven't slept since Sunday night. My appetite is mostly back to normal but I just wake up feeling sweaty and so, so tired. My head hurts and I just feel like crap. I expected to start feeling better and dreaming a bit more after day 3, but that's not been the case. And, I've severely reduced my sugar intake now that I'm not getting the munchies every hour, and I think this might be making me feel worse. But I'm home now and trying to resist the urge, and its honestly not that bad. 

I'm glad I just found this sub, its giving me more motivation. Even though I'm so tired and hungry and still haven't really had many dreams, I already feel so much more energy and my thoughts are racing in a positive way. I'm proud of myself!

Flower, vapes, edibles, all day, every day, for the past 3 months, and I do NOT have a job where you’re allowed to consume. I knew I needed to cut back, but I pushed the pedal down. I hate to admit it, but nothing was going to stop me, until I started getting panic attacks—terrible anxiety in my chest and neck. At first I thought it was an allergic reaction because I couldn’t breathe, but the more people I talked to, the more I realized it was the weed exacerbating my anxiety.

I smoked every day around late 2019 when I was unemployed for about 3 months, which stopped me from getting a job, then when I actually started to try to get a job I stopped so I could pass the drug test, but as soon as I got the job, I started smoking again, even more. 
Eventually I quit, but replaced it with drinking due to family concerns, then they got concerned about my drinking, and went back to smoking, I did that a few times, before smoking completely took over my life, I'd wake up at 3am for my job, have a joint, take a shower and go to work, but soon I stopped taking showers, and then stopped going to work, my mental health plummeted, I couldn't go an hour without having another joint. I had to move back in with my parents and get a different job 2 hours away. And I hadn't smoked in at least 6 months.
I went out drinking with a friend about a month and a half ago and got weed for after we got back (I actually didn't end up smoking it that night but took it home), and when I smoked it at home, I hated it, it tasted shit, the high made me feel like I wasn't even there, unfortunately I couldn't stop myself from smoking the rest, every puff I hated myself more. When it was gone I felt relieved. 
Coming to this Christmas, I'm out in the middle of nowhere with my parents, the perfect place for it, but I made sure I didn't get any, made it all the way through Christmas without it, and I'm so happy, I got to enjoy Christmas while being all there, it felt great, and today has confirmed to me that I don't need weed",11

The physical action of smoking (bringing a joint / pipe / vape, etc to your mouth and taking a hit) is definitely a point of addiction for me. 

Currently off weed but still vaping low level nicotine so it's not a problem at the moment, but I plan on stopping the vape in the next days as well. 

I've heard things like chewing gum or lollipops help act as an alternative to this... wondering if you have any other reccomendations?

Honestly I'm jumping up and down with joy. Or I was for like the past 5 hours. I still can't sleep as my excitement is just through the roof.

I have been so out of it the last few years, I didn't understand my own emotions, my own actions, or even the person I was becoming. But over the last month and 8 days specifically I've found myself again.

My old goals and projects that I had long forgotten about, that lay dormant in the back of my mind. They have all began to resurface. 

I used to love to code. I used to do it for hours at a time, as it was one of the few things my ADHD could focus on constantly. I haven't touched any markup languages or coding programs in years.. as being high on drugs and weed just made it feel so mundane and boring.

Little did I know it was sober me that found this stuff entertaining... I always thought I just got bored as fuck with it... But no


I just spent the last 5 hours (which felt literally like 1 hour) creating a whole test website for myself just to prove that I could still do it.

It was so much fun, as I haven't touched HTML in years, and I was kinda worried I would forget how to do it.. but I just started typing away, and before I knew it... I had a working, 2 page website that I built from the ground up.

It's nothing impressive, but just the shear fact I got so much enjoyment and excitement out of fucking text on a screen is amazing. The career I wanted to do is coming back into fruition and I can feel my ambitions and drive just going all the way back up to 100.

On top of all of this I've had so much energy since quitting... I have been working out again regularly, I love the taste of food again already, life has gained all of its meaning back, and even my mental health has seen an almost night and day improvement.

Life is good guys, and it's fucking worth it. I remember before I quit I used to read these posts and think almost nothing of it... Now I'm amazed that in only 8 days of being cannabis free so much has happened.

I'm going swimming tomorrow (indoor) and this is going to be a good Christmas.

Love you all. Have a great night guys.",60

I don’t feel like myself anymore 26 days of sobriety and I seem to just be existing.  Everything is different even down to the thoughts in my head. They used to happen automatically now I struggle to even remember something i thought about seconds ago.

It’s so frustrating and upsetting, I wasn’t perfect before I smoked, but at least I still seemed to be an actual person.

The first days and couple of weeks were honestly terrible, my depression was through the roof, and at the time I did not see how it would be possible to continue.

My head is so much clearer, my anxiety is significantly lowered, that constant nagging addict guilt is gone, and it’s so much easier to get myself motivated about things like chores and errands.

Worth pointing out that I moved to a new (much nicer) apartment about six weeks into quitting and that was an enormous factor in being successful - the drastic change of scenery really helped me see my whole life in a new light. That, coupled with a few helpful apps, and deleting my guy’s number so temptation was less of an option, were really what enabled me to be successful. 

Anyway, stumbling on this sub back in May is what originally made me have the a-ha moment that I was truly addicted. I know there are always a ton of posts about the struggle, so just wanted to offer a positive one.

Its almost like I ""check out"" from whats happening around me when I am sober or atleast thats how it feels...Is this dissociation?????If it is why I am I dissociating when I am sober...when I am high I feel like a completely different person who can feel...example A ...when I was high I all of a sudden had the urge to check in with my wife(F26)...I found out she was really going through a difficult time due to stress and anxiety caused by work overload, past trauma, dealing with an addict for a husband (Me) and lifes many daily responsibilities that keep us constantly busy... how could I not think about my wifes emotional state for 5 days?  :(also why did I only emotionally check in with her or myself when I was high???

-  Hope my ramble is somewhat cohesive...I know I need to stay sober and I intend to...this experience and feeling really freaks me out.",9

I've been using cannabis off and on for almost 20 years now - I'm 37 - and am once again wanting to quit - I have 2 kids, want to do right by them and my wife. The last few times I stopped, I had chronic insomnia until I started again, which has me pretty anxious about stopping. I primarily use at night, if I vape it quickly becomes all day. Its been especially bad since COVID started.  I have gone to a few MA meetings, but tbh I am extremely anxious about going because I work in mental health / substance use treatment, have worked with literally thousands of people in my area (I was a crisis counselor for a decade) and I am terrified of encountering former or current clients at a meeting. But at the same time, I feel so lonely and isolated in my use and wanting to stop, scared to try again - I have quit and failed more times than I can count - This is complicated by PTSD from work and chronic depression. Not sure what to ask here for, maybe someone to chat with or suggestions? Thanks for reading this far.",7

He was visiting briefly then went back home to arizona, and we had disagreements about his alcoholism, but it made me feel like a hypocrite telling him to stop when i can never stop my weed smoking. Shortly after i was working the bar at my work an a freelance percussionist that played for Earth, Wind & Fire came to eat and drink. He’s 82, he said his secret to a long and healthy life was sobriety, and it kinda stuck with me. Those two events simultaneously happening have given me the strength to finally lay off the weed for probably my second longest streak ever (i hit 56 days in 2019), and i’ve been fine for the most part. I’ve even been off nicotine for the same amount of time which i wasnt able to do my last quit streak i had.
I’ve been on edge, dealing with my temper more often, just learning how to regulate my emotions without going for a bowl or pen rip. Its the only way i knew how to the last 5 years. And honestly it hasn’t been so bad. I’m glad that my appetite and insomnia havent hit me so hard as other times where i have tried to quit. I’ve even been able to be around it and say no, like yesterday i had a christmas party with friends and everyone went outside to smoke. I was very close to smoking, i even asked for a hit of someone vape but it happened to be dead in that moment so i took it as a sign to keep my streak. I mainly just miss smoking for the comfort, for the time i spend alone, to fuel my boredom, to watch movies. But i think im going to keep this streak going and end the new year with this new found strength. I can’t say i’ve learned a whole lot about my sober self besides that i have a temper that i am not a fan of, but hopefully more clarity comes with sobriety.

Up until about 18, I said no to weed relentlessly as all my friends were stoners. My addiction started about two years ago after me and a friend decided to get high and bought a dab pen. I was 18 then, and I figured I was grown up enough to give it a try. The high was immeasurably good. I had only drank up until that point, and I didn’t know how much I could enjoy a substance until that moment. The pandemic hit, which left me home more than ever. Over the course of the next few months, my weed usage gradually started increasing. Couldn’t fall asleep? Puff of the dab would fix it. Playing video games? A dab would make it more enjoyable. It continued to evolve like that, until eventually nothing was fun without weed. I transitioned to a group of friends who smoked as opposed to my usual ‘boring’ group, which only made my usage higher. Before I knew it, I was spending $300 on weed per paycheck. I was constantly craving it. I also have really bad ADHD, so that did not help whatsoever with my impulsiveness to get high. That was about a year ago now and  since then I’ve been kicked out of my house for not keeping my room in order, sold everything to pay bills and get high, dropped out of school and lost a job due to high absence rates. All of this pain, and yet I still smoke everyday. I’ve made plenty of attempts at quitting, but I just wanna get high again so bad.

I had never imagined smoking or become a ""stoner"" prior to high school, but always entertained the idea of it. As I entered my freshman year of boarding school, surrounded by dormmates who smoked, a series of misinformed decisions led me to take one hit off a fake cartridge using a hot wire. From that point on, weed consumed my life. Almost every waking hour, I would either be thinking about getting high, smoking, or figuring out the next way I could get weed.

I started on January 24th in 2019, and since then the longest I've spent without smoking is two months. For most of this time, I've smoked multiple times a day, often right after waking up and right before bed. While in denial of my habits, the effects have spiraled out of control. I'm constantly paranoid, insecure, and emotionally unstable. I never find myself thinking about the present situation, but rather overthinking about a minor occurrence from earlier. I can't focus. Part of this could definitely be due to other unhealthy habits in life, but weed has killed all the meaningful motivation in me to put towards self-improvement.

Going through high school with weed, most of my friendships have been formed around the drug, and even my current relationship feels like that. My girlfriend and I spend so much time stressing about weed. On her birthday dinner, I started apologizing profusely and she cried after checking that my pen ran out of battery, because I hadn't checked before bringing it to the restaurant.

I lack any perception of myself or who I want to be. Weed has been especially terrible as a teenager and ruined my brain in the most formidable years of my development. I'm terrified of how I'll end up.

I really want to quit, but it seems like everything in my life would disappear. It's so depressing to say, but without weed I feel like nothing. I go to a notoriously stressful and rigorous high school, and quitting would be extremely hard with my current workload. I've been very lucky to have done well in school and recently got into college, but I feel that all of my terrible habits and lack of motivation will catch up to me unless I quit weed.

To me, all of this seems impossible. I know that mindset can only hold me back in attempting to quit, but my situation truly feels intractable. I just had my first session with our high school counselor, but I couldn't find the courage to tell them the fullest extent of my problems for fear of my parents finding out. It's entirely my fault and my mistakes have caught up to me, but I'm looking for any advice from anyone. I need any help I can get.",2

I'm trying not to be hard on myself as I know that'll just make this harder but I'm quitting again!

For me cannabis has always had a positive effect, after smoking weed (like the day after that) I always noticed I was more social and agreeable, aswell as made more friends. When I quit I hadn't noticed any side effects except for the fact that I barely had a appetite for the first two weeks, after that nothing. The only weird thing is that now I'm actually starting to get urges to smoke again (typically only when I'm really sad or something) but this never happened before until about a week or two ago which seems irregular since I thought by now I wouldnt have any real cravings especially since I havent had any when I first started smoking.",2

This past week has been a tough one to say the least. Something inside of me wants to get this holiday season over with. I had a real hard time getting in the Christmas spirit this year. Not sure if it’s because of losing my sister last December and this was her favorite holiday or not. I just feel irritated and kind of lost.

My mind feels heavy and all I want to do is keep low. I will be visiting family on the 24th and 25th but feel afraid of visiting people this year. I keep telling myself my gifts suck and are not as good as they usually are in the past. I live with someone immuno-compromised and have not been heading out since this pandemic hit. Just work, home and repeat.

I’m sharing this because it’s not always about the highs. While you should always embrace the good, it’s important to know that you are not alone. I don’t drink so there is nothing to run to right now. I am okay struggling this way. Just wish I had some friends to reach out to and be there for right now. That usually helps me get out of my head but lost people along the way.

Since I can’t be here for someone in the flesh, I hope to be here for you, reader. The highs and lows and this uphill battle we face is a mother trucker. I am sorry we struggle the way we do. I am sorry we needed to depend on something so baseless and shitty all these years. Just know I think you are amazing regardless of where you are on your path and remember that life is for the taking.

Sending you all my love over the next few days. Reach out to someone, anyone if you are able. The same way we should not diminish our progress the same way we should not look at the glass being half empty. Let’s appreciate what we have regardless of how much or how little that sits with us. We are all so damn lucky to be alive right now even if this is the worst of times since God knows when. The lack of compassion I have witnessed a few times in December out and about has me defeated sometimes. I feel so ready to make a change for the better but there is always something bigger out there we need to challenge ourselves with.

You are strong.

You matter.

You failed, it’s ok. You can get back on that horse and ride stronger the next time.

You are worth all the pain and struggle. Regardless of who can see your progress.

2021-12-23 19:08:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rn95kf/today_marks_one_year_without_weed_my_story/,"Today marks one year without weed, my story","Hello people!

One year ago, I decided to give another shot to quit weed. It's wasn't my first try, I tried many time before and that's okay, for me what was really important was to do it in the right state of mind and be positive about it.

What I will share is my take on it, what worked for me. Understand that we are all different so don't beat yourself because you're trying a path that's not working for you.

I'm 38, I started smoking at around 18, I've been daily smoker for 15years straight. I've done most of the stories we read in this sub, I befriended people only to partake on their joint, I stole weed from others when they were sleeping, I hid and lived at night so that nothing would screw my high. I've smoked plastic joint because I was dry and I had to scratch the keef residue on a tupperware. I've missed so many social events, one of my best friend wedding (hiding in my room to smoke while they were banging on the door), and countless times where my mind just wasn't there, I had only one thought: going back to my hole to light one up. I've taken a lot of risks crossing a border multiple times to score some weed, driving or taking the train for hours. I've wasted so much time waiting for a stupid dealer, outside in the cold, in the morning before he was awake, I made such a fool of myself so many times... I couldn't finish my studies, I got stuck in the 4th year at uni and couldn't go further, I wasted so much money, time, friendship, love and potentials.

Of course weed was just an excuse, it IS very addictive and messes up with your mind but you are still there, you can still think and be responsible for your decisions. I was depressive (still am to some extend). I beat myself for any reasons, weed helped me swallow that pill. I loved the rituals, I loved the risk, the weed fog kept me away from thinking too much about life and facing my responsabilities. But weed was never enough, I always wanted more, I could never truly fully enjoy a joint, rolling the next one took some of my high away so I would roll three in a row to be fully blasted but even doing so wasn't enough.

Don't you hate the fact that you can never truly enjoy a high? You are always chasing it, something/someone is always ruining it...

I let myself totally go and I am very lucky to have had a loving and supporting family during all this time. After failing in my studies, I was unemployed for two years, I touched rock bottom, no money, no motivation, no work experience. I was overweight and smoked everyday all day. Somehow thanks to a program supporting young unemployed, I landed a job in my trade (IT). It was a shitty job doing errands, underpaid with a stupid boss but it was a start. It gave me some structure. I just had to wake up in the morning. This job made it possible for me to put some money aside, I was no longer broke begging my parents for money. I was able to gain some self esteem. It was the start of a positive feedback loop.

I found the time to smoke still, I would rush, running back home to be able to smoke 5-6 joints after work into the night, waking up wasted the next day(I never did the wake and bake thing while working though). I did that for three years straight until I was again super lucky to land another, better, job. I swore myself to give my best not screwing up this chance. 

Slowly I started smoking a little less, 3 joints only after work, still no limit during the weekend. Thanks to that job I had free dental health care, I neglected my teeth for a long time so I had to do 7 sessions in short period to fix multiples cavities.

Then it hit me...

Weed made me forget about time, made me think that everything could last forever, that living isn't that important. But witnessing parts of my body aging and decaying proved that all of that was BS.

We only live once, your life is what you make out of it. At that moment, I made the decision to better my life. The deal was to take my time, to be nice with myself but to take back control of my life.

I started with my room which had always been in an awful state, useless stuff everywhere, I started throwing all that was not necessary, sorting everything, making some room to breathe. Then I tackled my eating habits, I would no longer indulge myself in bad food, for sugar I would stick to dark chocolate, I would cook more for multi-meals that I could freeze. But the most important was sport, I started bicycling to work and I loved it. I went on going everyday to work by bike.

All of this took a year to set up, I took my time but made it, I lost almost 20kg, I was back in good shape, I was more social, I worked better and received positive reviews. This helped me going on, spending more time working, cooking and working out also meant I had less time to smoke. I was still on 2-3 joints per day. I still couldn't stop, my weekend were still devoted to God MJ.

Fast forward two years to a little more than 1 year ago. I saw a Joe Rogan podcast where he said that he would stop smoking one month every year to lower his tolerance. I decided to try it, taking the decision to never smoke again is a daunting one but limit that to one month then you would have a tangible achievable goal. So I did it, it was hard in the beginning, I had craving the whole month, did the 30 days then I started smoking again. I wasn't mad with me, I was happy to complete the deal, the deal didn't say to never smoke again, just to abstain for 30days.

Even better, that pause gave me some glimpse about how life could be without that permanent weed mind haze. To be frank, I liked it, I liked the fact to be able to concentrate, to do things, to enjoy some social time. It's like the world was shifting, smoking was not a relief anymore, I started seeing it for what it was. 

When you smoke, you get a nice high for 30min to an hour but it doesn't end there, the drug stays in your brain for HOURS. You cannot say, 'oh, I'll smoke just one joint and be productive two hours after that'. No, no you can't, it's a lie, I lied to myself plenty of times not to be fouled by it anymore. When you smoke in the morning, your day is ruined, you might as well continue smoking throughout the day and the next day you'll wake up with that horrible fog in your brain asking you to light one up to stench the craving, just once... The cycle would feed itself indefinitely.

So smoking started to be less and less attractive, I would smoke half a joint, and wait as long as possible to finish it. I did the one month pause two or three times, each time trying to project myself in a futur that would be better without weed.

Then one year ago, I smoked my last quarter joint and decided to try one more time. My goal wasn't to quit, my goal was to live without it, I WANTED to have a day by day experience without the craving, without the haze, without the hindrance that weed impose on to you. I knew that the first days are crucial so my last joint was the day before a 10-day trip abroad to visit my father. I could have plenty of sleep and meditate for the future.

It sticked to my plan, it wasn't that hard to be honest, I was decided. It took three months for the cravings and the haze to go away. It's impressive how long this drug stick to your body and soul... To help, I started running every few days. When you're not smoking, you can use your lungs to the full extend, that's living for me and it's a high so much better than weed.

Today, weed is totally and incredibly out of my mind.

Don't be too hard on yourself, you want to want to stop because you KNOW how life is better without. If you can't see it, maybe you're not ready yet. It took a long time for me to slowly change, your journey is different, take your time, it's ok to smoke, it's better not to though. Try living without before quitting coldturkey, be honest with yourself, be nice to you. Weed is just a stupid drug, you know that's not the reason why your life is not the way you want it to be. Life is still as dull and boring sometimes  with or without drugs, accept it, live with it.

Get enough sleep, eat well, exercise, love yourself, be nice to other, life will get better.

The alcohol led me to have a celebratory nicotine hit from hookah. That led me the next day to think what the hell, I relapsed with the alcohol and nicotine, might as well start over with weed too…Even though weed is the substance I want to be rid of the most. On a positive note, the two times I smoked yesterday and the day before felt really uneventful. I really just felt lethargic. And yet I still want to give into one last smoke today since my relapse didn’t feel enjoyable enough. My logic is really ridiculous but it shows me how powerful this addiction is. I don’t want to fall into daily smoking again but with today being my 3rd day in a row I wanted to post here for some support and advice. I feel discouraged but there is some part of me that feels like this will be the time that I make it stick and that this will hopefully be my last relapse. I’m really shocked that I relapsed but I don’t want to beat myself up too much. I’m very thankful for this subreddit to allow me to post this for accountability, it seems like every time I vent here I’m able to reflect and get back on the sober wagon.",18

Strangely I have no cravings at all and am so happy to start the new year with this positive mindset. 

I know it’s only early days but I know this is the best thing to come out of this year. 

I’m glad we’re doing this together so we have the support to get through this. 

Here’s to a happy and healthy new year! I can’t wait to see the positive effects it will have on our health!

I’m dealing with extreme feelings of guilt because I’m not more excited about my second pregnancy (although my husband and I were trying) on top of withdrawal symptoms. I found out I was pregnant on Sunday. I had one joint left so I smoked it over the last 3 days, smoking less each day, and today has been my first day not smoking. Since Monday, I can barely eat. Like everything is repulsive to me. I have a constant headache and can’t stop clenching my jaw or bouncing my leg. I have such a short fuse right now. 

I have borderline personality disorder and cannabis has been such a huge part of my mental health plan. It calms me down, it helps me sleep, it helps me eat. It makes me more creative and brings me peace in a way that isn’t attainable sober. I would say that I was a functioning stoner, able to do pretty much anything while high without people knowing. I smoked anywhere from 3-5 times a day, more often on the higher end, for the last year and a half or so. 

Dealing with my mixed emotions over this pregnancy is so fucking hard right now. It would be hard even if I was still able to smoke, but it’s worse that I can’t give myself the relief I desperately need and can’t even take a fucking Advil to ease the headache.

Not that new here, my second descent leave, last time around a 'small well overtought' relapse lead into 6months daily smoking. 

Anyways, after last work-break this summer i took control again. No more smoking. Lots of cravings, but stron/happy and busy enough to keep keep it going.

But today was the last workday, last 2 weeks were over the top busy, and now..., all is done, the kids are at grannies, my gf is sleeping on the couch, drank and smoked to much on/after work-xmas party. And here i am, feeling bored out, empty, ... and while struggling with cravings in my mind... these feeling just grow.

Anyways, if someone else wrote this, i would advice to stay strong, look beyond this moment, life isnt all about work and daily tasks... be proud to look back at how far i made it. Think about the positive effects it had on myself and loved ones...

I just wanted to write this off. 

I also wonder if i will ever stop feeling like an (ex)addict, or at least for a few days.. just, a normal 33y who had a past with smoking... but due to small daily cravings or reminders to smoking, i have this thought-process in my mind that, and i always end up with 'no i should not smoke anymore, i should not give in'

Weed has very effectively high jacked the pleasure center of our minds. Because of that, the day in and day out grind of sobriety is going to feel really heavy. The substance lies to you. I don’t know who needs to hear this but…

Weed does not balance your mood.
Weed does not give you energy.
Weed does not give you focus. 

Weed gives you a quick, temporary burst of pleasure that quickly fades away. And in its wake it leaves destruction. It leaves shame, guilt, brokenness and so much more.

In the midst of detox and seeking sobriety when your brain feels like it’s splitting in two, it’s actually healing.

So anytime you hit that emotional breakdown, every time you have a night sweat, every hour you can’t sleep, every person you want to go off on, REMEMBER….

Your brain is healing.


It will be next to impossible to quit a behavior  if we don’t know why we do it in the first place and why it’s beneficial to leave it behind. 

I am preaching to myself here. Because my brain is against me right now and I have to tell it the truth and calm it down so I can continue down the path of sobriety. Which is super HARD.

Whether you are thinking about quitting,
Preparing to quit, making plans to quit, on day 200, on hour 2 , or minute 1 you should be super proud of yourself, because what we are doing is hard, so hard in fact that millions of people will continue in addiction because it’s just too hard. Let’s be the light to all of those wandering in the dark of this addiction. It’s a beast.

It doesn’t do much to actually excite me, so I share with my girlfriend or family my good marks? Yes, but is almost for the secondary validation rather than pride or joy from the mark. 

I’ve fucked my self because really I’m smart enough to get by, in everything. I can get good enough grades that if I do stuff the last day or a day late I still get grades I’m ‘satisfied’ with. I am personable enough my girl appreciates how I love her, but I know I could be more present and attentive. My work ethic could really be more then the bare minimum. 

All these things get fucked because I love to reward myself for anything by eating edibles. I realized that I used to be wary of weed because I was aware it didn’t allow me to be my best self. And now I realize I don’t care enough to even have that internal dialogue anymore. 

Weed is making me fuck up my potential and I don’t even have fun on it anymore, I just enjoy the numbness and lack of worry. But that feels pretty weak.

41 year old male here, smoked for 25 years and got sober in June 2020... believe its the longest I've been sober since 1992 :)

Cravings! The curse of many of a want-to-be-sober stoner.

Getting clean for me was making quitting the #1 priority in my life, for both as long as it took and to give it as much effort as it needed. It was a mix of learning new skills, introspection and self psycho-analysis. Being comfortable with being uncomfortable and deeply and truly wanting change in my life. I dedicated time to preparing and planning. I became excited about being sober and looked at weed, and booze for me, as a major negative force in my life. This all helped.

I spent time thinking about what a craving was. I was prepared for ""cravings"" to be a reality before I started stopping. Cravings were what might cause me to slip back into a life of addiction with a once again unknown end date. A continuous spiral of smoking, negative emotions, guilt, shame and keeping on with a lifestyle that I knew was unhealthy for me.

What was a craving anyway? I asked myself. After pondering on this I came to the conclusion that, for me, a craving was simply a thought. A thought with the potential to become overwhelmingly powerful, but only a thought none-the-less. It seemed pretty simple stripped down to this version.

Twenty-five years of being stoned and ""wanting"" to be stoned created this cycle of thoughts leading to ""cravings"" that ended with me using weed. This was a condition that I cultivated, one that I alone developed by repeating a process over and over for a very long time.

After I quit I saw that cravings started with a simple and not very powerful thought. Thoughts that would arise because, going by my old routine it was time to use weed. It could have been triggered by my arrival home after work, waking up a non-work day, pre or post meal, pre or post sex, whatever, there was some sort of trigger that would remind me that in my pre-sober days it was time for weed. It was just a thought borne out of old patterns - nothing more, nothing less.

Those thoughts turned to cravings through rumination, repetition, chasing, yearning. The craving started out as a simple thought and then I was giving it power by chasing it around, entertaining it, keeping it alive in my mind. Once I got sober I made up my mind that weed was no longer a part of my life. I accepted that those thoughts would come along but I was determined to do something about them.

My strategy was to just relax and see it for the reality it was. Because of all the past reinforcement they were bound to come about, and they did. When they did I remembered this truth behind what they actually were and each time I would then distract myself and shift my thoughts to something else. Now this wasn't easy, especially at first but I refused to obey the impulses that came with those thoughts, those ""cravings"". This went on for months but eased up along the way. The more I practiced and refused to give into those thoughts or give them any of my energy the weaker they became.

Here I am almost 19 months later and yes thoughts of weed do bubble up from time to time. Naturally they would - I spent 25 f\*\*\*ing years in that cycle. The surprising thing is though, how much that has diminished in a short 19 months. They aren't nothing but their power has dwindled to the point it's only a very minor factor in my life. Its no longer so concerning or jarring, its no longer stressful, they no longer control me. I'll never let my guard up because I know that like a pool of gasoline it would take only one match to re-ignite. My only job now is to keep those matches a safe distance away.

My biggest issue is with filling time and with my emotions. Ever since I was 7 I have been using a variety of bad coping methods from overeating, self-harm, restricting my food intake to dangerous levels and finally, substance abuse.

I have been high for 12 hours a day every day for the past four or so months, and the four months before that I was high every now and then.
Now I absolutely have to stop smoking weed and using nicotine immediately, because I have a surgery coming up In january that I will need to quit both for.

I am sure that I will succeed In not buying anymore weed or nicotine, which will lead to me not being able to use any of it, but I am very worried about falling back onto old habits of self-harm in any other forms.

The reason I am sure, is because I succeeded In losing 55kg or around 120lbs In one year recently with sheer willpower. I know I can do it, but I am scared of my emotions. 

I have significant trauma about my body-image and especially the way it relates to exercise. I have yet to find a way of exercising that makes me feel anything other than miserable, so I am pessimistic that I would find relief  in that.

If anyone has any suggestions on what I could do to make things easier for myself I would love to hear it.

Eta: I have been crying a lot today. A lot more than I have In the past few months. I just feel like such a failure of a human being. I will not be relapsing, but I feel terrified of thay days to come. It seems like it has to still get worse before it gets better and I am genuinely scared I won't make it without turning to something else.",29

I introduced him to weed some years ago and our consumption has increased steadily. Smoking doesn't really affect any of us like we want it to anymore. For that our tolerance is to high. But without it we're both crazy emotional. He's now on day 3 without weed and I'm on day 2. 

He had a mental breakdown yesterday and mine came as soon as I woke up this morning. I had a toothbrush issue. How f*cking stupid is that? My new replacement brush didn't fit, and I'd used the old one to remove some mold. So suddenly I had no brush and a sickening taste in my mouth. And that was enough for me to contemplate suicide. 

I tried to quit this summer and went four weeks sober before I eventually ended up smoking again. The weird thing is that in those weeks I felt like I was dying. I was even admitted to the hospital. It was horrible. My blood work showed anomalies and I was screened for cancer. When I started smoking again my blood went back to normal and I felt like me again. 

But I hate the fact that I'm smoking. We can't afford it. It makes us lazy. It's unhealthy. And so on. 

I feel trapped. After what I've read, the detox symptoms should decrease, but it doesn't for me. I went all in when I quit. I started eating healthier, exercised every day, meditated and spendt more time with my family. But I was in a constant pool of sweat, my hands and legs was shaking uncontrollably, my heart rate was completely out of wack, I had chronic brain fog and my emotions kept shifting between rage (smashing things into smithereens with a crowbar), depression, euphoria and anxiety. I've never heard of anyone else having reactions like these. But maybe someone here has. In that case, when did your body and emotions turn to normal?",152

In the week since I quit, I managed to get more shit done than I have for the past 1 month. The nights still suck but the mornings are great. I wake up fresh and with more energy. I don't wake up with the baggage of thoughts running in my head about where to smoke, when to smoke, and how to get the next gram.

This is a long post, so TLDR: So as of today I’m 9 weeks sober. And I finally threw away the last of my stash. And I wanted to tell this subreddit, because you all helped me along the way even if you didn’t know it. Thank you guys. 


I’m a married woman in my mid-thirties with a full time white color job and a grade school kid. My husband is a recovering alcoholic with 10 years sobriety. 

I thought I knew what addiction looked like after going through an intense year of court-mandated AA and IOP with my husband. I heard a lot of stories and heard lots of rock bottoms, and they all seem pretty low— something I came to define addiction by. That you had to lose a lot and hurt a lot of people before you were an addict. 

I still don’t know if I’m an addict, but I know that cannabis dependency caused me a lot of anxiety and guilt over the last two years, and I don’t think I can use it any more. 

I started using in college at 18, a few times a week during the academic year and daily during the summers. I loved how it made me feel less self conscious, and I thought it made me more fun to be around. I always enjoyed smoking, my life didn’t revolve around it, and it was something I liked rather than needed. 
 
I didn’t use throughout most of my 20s, and it wasn’t something I thought I’d get back into. Then I moved to a state where cannabis was legal. My usage crept up over the years from occasional to casual to frequently to daily. From March 2020 to August 2021, I got high every single night. Isolation + pandemic + anxiety and depression = no sober sleeping. 

I only smoked at night. Sometimes a few hits, sometimes a whole bowl. A 10mg edible would knock me out. I thought because I wasn’t using all day, or wasn’t smoking huge amounts, that it wasn’t that much of a problem. The thing was, that I was convinced I couldn’t sleep without it. Just thinking about it gave my spiraling anxiety.

I snuck edibles on airplanes when I traveled because I couldn’t sleep without it. When I went camping with my family, I snuck away on nighttime walks to get high by the bathrooms. I smoked or had edibles every night before bed at home, and eventually started sleeping in a different room than my husband because I didn’t want him smelling smoke on me every night. I didn’t want him to think I had a problem. 

I started telling my therapist that I had to get stoned to sleep at night and that I’m terrified I can’t sleep without it. She kind of brushed it off like, if it helps you then what’s the problem? 

The problem was that I was sick of depending on a drug to sleep, tired of sneaking around to use it, feeling ashamed of needing it, and wondering where it went next. 

I finally quit in August. I was so scared to stop. After a few weeks of crazy dreams and insomnia, it turned out that I could survive without it. And before the end of the month, my sleep improved! And my anxiety improved! And my relationship improved. I thought I was just taking a break, and wasn’t ready to actually quit. In October, I used again before bed one night. I felt kind of guilty and wished I hadn’t. I didn’t sleep well. I felt bad the next morning. The next night I used again, waiting for that relaxation to wash over me. It didn’t. The night after that, and the night after that, I used again and again. 

What was I doing?? Where was this compulsion coming from? It really hit me that I didn’t even want to be stoned anymore. That the magic good feeling from college summers, it was never coming back for me. This is not fun, this is not medicine. This is dependency. This is… addiction? I just know that compulsion to use the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th night in a row felt really sketchy, and I feel like I caught myself before falling back into it again. 

So as of today I’m 9 weeks sober. And I finally threw away the last of my stash. I can say whole heartedly that I don’t smoke. And I wanted to tell this subreddit, because you all helped me along the way even if you didn’t know it. Thank you guys— I’m super grateful for everyone in here sharing and helping each other.

I’m looking for some advice. I’m 31F daily smoker for 10 years - literally only had a handful of days where I haven’t smoked anything. I smoke joints and smoke normally around 2g per day, sometimes more. 

I lost my mum unexpectedly last month, and am starting a new job in the middle of January. I’m studying a full time uni degree, and when I sit at home and smoke, I just get tired and want to sleep, or sit doomscrolling on my phone. I’ve struggled a lot to keep up with the uni work due to it being online learning and my smoking habits.

So basically I need to majorly cut down e.g one or 2 joints late at night when I’m done working and studying, or quit before I start the new job. 

It’s almost impossible for me just to distance myself from it as literally everyone around me smokes/sells.

Can anyone help with my first steps?

I forgot how much of an asshole I really am. Weed really covered up all the feelings of anger and rage. It puts me in a state of mental calmness, to the point that other people's emotion and actions normally do not get a rise out of me..

However I literally had to stop myself from cussing out two different people today, just because they were annoying. Which I know sounds super selfish, but it's the truth. 

I am getting angry at inanimate object. Like I will just break things. Like at work, I was cutting potatoes (I work in a restaurant) and we have to ""punch"" them through a slicer located on the wall.. well it shakes the wall a little bit, and a plastic container fell and hit me on the head, and my first reaction was literally to pick up the plastic container and smash it against the wall (which I did). That's not how a healthy adult manages ANY situation.

Idk how to control it, I really don't... I have been on drugs my whole life, I was put on ADHD medication at a very early age (8) and that helped to control my attention and keep me calm and focused.

After I lost my health insurance (10 years later) I switched to cannabis (and eventually other drugs as well)  to control my emotions, which worked well for a while..

I've never really learned how to cope, and I often forget that deep down.. I'm a very hateful person. I don't want to be.. I'd like to transfer the headspace I get on cannabis to real life, as I find that person gets along with people way better than the person I'm becoming right now.

I don't want to lose my job, and I will if I keep acting this way. Please any advice would be appreciated.",15
2021-12-23 00:20:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rmo1xt/quitting/,Quitting.,"Hey everybody. I’m 20 and have been smoking for about 4 years.

I'd consider myself a pretty ambitious and hardworking guy - studying at a top 20 global university and running a marketing business on the weekends at the time - but it had gotten to the point where I was living in a constant state of substance fuelled anxiety and felt like I was barely hanging on in many aspects of life. 

My daily habits consisted of smoking 1-2g of weed, vaping and smoking cigarettes constantly, tons of caffeine, hours scrolling through social media, xxx content, unhealthy food, and blacking out on weekends. I'd also fallen off my workout routine, was doing a poor job maintaining relationships in my life, and lost sight of certain hobbies and goals.

When returning home for summer break I decided I'd had enough and went cold turkey ... with everything. No weed, no vape, no coffee, no social media, no porn, no fast food, & very limited drinking. For more context, i'd been smoking weed since 13y/o and heavily smoking since 17 with the longest time off being a couple months.

In hindsight, I'm not sure if this was the best approach. It was the most psychologically challenging thing I've gone through and required me to distance myself from the majority of my friends. But it worked. I replaced my bad habits with good ones. Meditation, running, workouts, reading, family time, healthy diet, journalling, picking up old hobbies, etc all became part of my daily life. 

The first weeks were brutal, but it got better each day. Withdrawals faded, insomnia left, and by day 100 I was in the best shape of my life physically and mentally. But here's where I messed up. I was so confident in the discipline I had developed that I thought smoking 1 joint as a celebration of my progress would be no issue. 

I was wrong. 1 day of smoking turned into 2, which turned into 3, and soon enough I was back at school acting out most of the old habits I sacrificed so much to get rid of. I've smoked daily since then (with the odd couple days off when visiting family). 

If you're still reading this, I'd like to leave 3 things to consider if you're looking to quit weed. 

1. Your habits are much more interrelated than you may notice. For me, weed was the gateway to the majority of other bad habits. In the altered state of mind (being high) I had strong associations with all the other habits, and therefore relapsed on all of them as well. If you're in the same boat, kicking the weed addiction will likely let you improve other areas of your life like you couldn't even imagine. 

2. Weed is like a toxic ex (to me at least). I thought nothing bad would come of a quick one night stand, but next thing you know I'm back in a relationship with my ex, acting out all the same behaviours and in the same environments I had left for good reason. If you have an addictive personality don't trick yourself into thinking a quick smoke sesh is no big deal once you've made good progress. You deserve better.   

3. I don't remember what point 3 was lol, but I do think this reddit channel is your friend. Any type of community you can involve yourself with where there are like minded people striving to see the same changes you are will help keep you accountable, motivated, and confident in your decisions. I wish I had done this when trying to quit substances over the last few years instead of keeping to myself. 

After being high the last year and a half I'm now on day 5 of no weed again and hope to see it through for the long term. At the end of the day this is a subjective opinion from a random dude on the internet, but I hope this story can bring you some value or inspiration. The younger you are the easier it will be to develop better long term habits, but you can change no matter your age or circumstance. 

I wish you the best of luck.",124

I've tried multiple times. I picked up weed 2 years ago and haven't stopped smoking it. Maybe a few days here and there for tolerance or because I made a half-assed attempt at quitting. But I always come back to weed. When I'm sober, I just want to be high. When I'm high, I just want to be sober. This never ending cycle has been going on for the last 12 months but for some reason I can't bring myself to quit. I have ADHD so weed appeals to me because it slows my brain down to a bearable pace. But it makes me feel so dumb. I've decided I need to quit for good and stick to it. 

I'm flying to another state over New Years so I am hoping that will mean no weed for a few days, and maybe I can use that as momentum for quitting?

I'd really like someone to help me ensure that come 2022, I never touch weed again.

I quit nearly 3 months ago, and I am now 10 stone.
I **hate** it. I know I am not fat or even classed as overweight, using a calculator I have a BMI of 20.7 which is definitely within normal range.

But I feel disgusting. I have a slight belly now which I cannot trick myself into feeling happy about, my sister and mother are both overweight (my mother is actually obese), I cannot speak to them about this weight gain as I think they feel I'm rubbing their faces in it, they have even suggested I have an eating disorder (I don't, I enjoy food and I do eat, but not so much that I feel gaining a stone in such a short amount of time is normal).

I have bought an exercise bike which I use most days. My average calorie consumption is between 1000-1500 calories daily.

I am **still** gaining weight. Is this normal? I know weed speeds up your metabolism but I feel that my metabolism has now tanked, I feel like if I so much as just look at a cupcake I'll gain a pound. I am really struggling with this and really considering going back to smoking for literally no other reason than to lose weight.

I guess my question is this - will my metabolism return to normal eventually? Or am I going to just continue to gain weight? Can quitting weed actually cause the likes of hypothyroidism? Should I visit a GP?

It started out just taking one 10mg every night after work (but I WFH so some days I could be done by 1pm )and quickly snowballed into 125mgs every 3hrs and at it's peak I could easily take 10 of those 125s and not really feel high in 3-4 hrs. During the times I was getting high I would always keep a timer for 1 hr, to know when it was really hitting, and I would routinely watch porn or binge eat after that timer. Well a year and half of pretty much doing that every day after work, my friend told me about this sub. It perfectly described what I was doing and showed me the negative patterns I kept falling into (having someone lay it out for you and show how much of a ""loser"" you'd become was sobering).

It's been about 2 weeks since I stopped, and this time feels different than the other ""t-breaks"" I took in the past. However since stopping I've noticed that I've become way hornier, or just have the urge to masturbate a lot and it's been causing me some duration/sensitivity (false start) issues. It's been really embarrassing and humiliating. Anybody have any advice on this? Have I permanently messed up my mind with all the weed and porn?

My ldr boyfriend came to visit me and on his last day we smoked a joint. That was three weeks ago and I have smoked up everyday since. 

 I read a post on here that receptors build up in frequent users, so when we smoke again all those dormant receptors start firing at once. It makes perfect sense. It’s like a switch flips in me and I just can’t stop after that first hit. I’m not a “just one” type of girl and these last few weeks I have come to terms with that fact. First, I fool myself into thinking I can just do it at night, after sunset. Then I blink and suddenly I’m smoking from the moment I wake up in the morning until the moment I fall asleep. 

 Well, I haven’t smoked since yesterday morning. I had a lot of packing to do, so once the fog wore off some I busied myself with all my last minute prep for a trip across the country. I’m home for the holidays and my car is sitting right outside. It’d be so easy to go to the 420 store… But I want to leave (heh) that life behind. I was doing so well for those three months and it was the mistaken belief that I could smoke a little without consequence which was my undoing. 

 I’ve got the app reset. Back at phase one. I feel terribly anxious, tearful, irritated, lethargic, and most of all nauseous. But, I’m grateful for another chance to get it together. Weed has stopped me from living the life I want for the past ~7 years and now I want to make up for lost time and start growing as a person.

P.S. thank you for this community. I no longer feel crazy and alone. The torment is real, I haven’t made it up. I take great comfort in this and I will continue to post semi-regularly in the hopes that I can encourage someone else in the same way all of your posts have encouraged me to do what’s best for myself and my future. <3",17

I'm a junior in art school, and.... My roommate gave me a gram of weed as a Christmas present during finals week (he didn't know about my issues, and I know I should tell him, I'm just a private person.) I'd had such an insanely stressful exam period, so I dove right in. And of course it was fun at first, getting high and doing nothing around campus, but once I came home for break I started slowly falling back into old bad behavior patterns: avoiding my family, procrastinating work, sneaking around, feeling anxious when it wears off and smoking more to relieve the anxiety. 

I noticed myself starting to obsess about when I'd smoke next, how much I had left, etc etc... And I just hate that. Especially here at home for the break, it reminds me of the horrible withdrawals I had during quarantine, and that alone generates so much anxiety. So last night, in the midst of nerves that made me feel physically ill, I went ahead and flushed what I had left down the toilet. Then I stayed with my family and watched Christmas movies until the anxiety finally went away, and I slept really fuckin' good. Today I woke up and I feel great.

It would be easy to talk about how ashamed I am for relapsing, but I'd like to talk about how proud I am of myself instead. I didn't wait until I ran out of pot to quit. I recognized that it was warping my priorities and I got rid of it before Christmas. I was proactive - and I rode out the anxiety instead of postponing it with another bowl.  Throwing the weed out was not a punishment, it was a gift to myself. I deserve to be happy and relaxed while I am sober. I deserve to enjoy the holidays without worrying about developing a habit.",3

I found my way back to this sub and I want to share something, I noticed in the last few days of soberness.

When I smoke weed, I keep lying to myself. I keep bullshitting myself all the time. I start to explain to myself, that I need the substance to cope with the difficult experiences I had during my childhood and adolescence.
I start playing the victim, I start telling myself that everyone else is responsible for the way I felt and feel. 
I start hating about the world and almost everyone in it, because I was treated really badly back then.

But the crucial point for me is, that it's not like that anymore. The only person, that treats me like shit now, is myself.
The only person, that keeps hurting and abusing me, is myself.

You may ask yourself: ""Why the fuck you keep doing this mate?""

Here's the answer. Because I'm an addict to THC.
Because I do everything to justify the weed use to myself. 

I fucked up so many things in the last years because of this addiction. Lost close friends, lost my driving license, had a psychosis, was close to kill myself because of the horrible depression, paranoia and anxiety the weed abuse caused.
And I still kept using.

I want to stop bullshitting myself. I want to stop playing the victim and finally start taking responsibility for my life.

I'm on day 17 now. I hope, I can keep this streak up.

I wish you all the best for your journey. 
Sincerly, a THC-addict",18

for some background: around 6 months ago i started smoking carts constantly - i was hitting my pen in school/public bathrooms, waking up and smoking in the middle of the night, first thing in the morning, etc.  it was very unhealthy and worsened my anxiety and depression significantly, and because of this i cleaned up my act for a little while. 

a few weeks ago, i stopped smoking. i had been sober for 2 weeks and then something happened where a friends parent kinda reported my weed usage to my mom and some shit got a little ugly. i won’t go into it bc long story. i guess i was spiteful over the fact that sobriety was no longer my choice but rather a pressure from parents and friends, so i started smoking again. i wish i hadnt but i rly think regretting it is not helpful so it is what it is. yesterday my friend, who knows i’ve been trying to quit, gave me a harsh but honest pep talk and it helped me see that being high all the time wasn’t worth it.  so here i am, back to day 1, but i’m honestly feeling more committed than the other times so i’m hoping i can keep it up. the worst part for me is always the insomnia and that’s what breaks me (along with boredom) but i’ve gotten through it before so i can do it again.  and for anyone else trying to quit: you can absolutely do it and you’re not alone. i believe in you <3

I decided to just start with weed, but perhaps doing both at the same time would help. Seeing as they are both smoking something. What do you guys think?

I don't even like being high. It makes me feel sick or just unproductive. I get stressed say fuck it and smoke. The addicted bit of my brain seems to expect a different result. 

I like being here. When I'm smoking I scroll. As soon as I see a leaves post I end up putting it down and reevaluating why I just smoked or started smoking that. Even if I do come back an hour later.

My first post mainly because I actually haven't smoked yet today. Lunch is nearly over. I can make it at least to 8pm. I do it in the office I can do it at home.",5

It can hit hard and fast; however, if you take a step back and rationalize, you’ll find that most of it is fairly minor in the big picture. Normal life is full of stress and anxiety; whether it be related to paying bills, maintaining relationships or navigating whatever curveballs life can throw our way. Initially after quitting smoking, it may feel overwhelming, like impending doom. Trust me, it’s not.

So before you consider running back to the pipe to ease that worry, try to take a step back and repeatedly tell yourself that, externally, nothing is that much different now vs before. Sure, the drug use may have set you behind on some life goals, but that’s why your quitting right? You have plenty of time to catch up on the things you may have neglected. It’s all a stepwise process and it won’t be completed over night. Allowing yourself to feel is one of the steps. 

Sometimes I’ll write down everything that is making me anxious. I don’t keep an official journal or anything, often it’s just a random blank piece of paper or an email to myself. When I see it written, it’s almost as if I’m looking at myself in the third person. This helps rationalize the situation and move past the mental paralysis.",5

As you can tell, I’m a bit angry about having to spend Christmas alone in isolation. That’s besides the point.

I had just run out of weed, too, so it was perfect timing. However, I wasn’t sure if I was going to stick with it. Getting COVID was honestly the best thing that could have happened to me in this situation (I have 0 symptoms, am vaccinated with a booster, and I’m 20, but I understand how it may be inappropriate for me to say that). It’s been like a mini rehab. I have no choice but to stay sober. And honestly, I couldn’t be happier.

I started smoking because I was so depressed, and it helped at first, but I slowly became more depressed because of it. I thought my mental health was getting worse, so I would smoke more, which made it even worse, etc. I now realize that being sober is not nearly as dull or depressing as I remember it to be.

I’m here to say that basically, even if you have to lock yourself in your room to do it, you should try. Trust me, you’ll find stuff to do. It’s mundane, sure, but you slowly realize how it feels to have actual emotions instead of living in a daze. Sometimes they’re bad, but that’s literally a part of being human. Smoking to cope with everyday issues should not be the norm!

I’m honestly not sure how this post is going to come off, but know I have no negative intentions at all in doing so. I’m just saying that boredom is totally natural to feel, and that’s a good thing. It means you’re feeling, and not in a foggy daze!

Keep it up guys. It gets better, I swear. <3

Smoking weed fucked me up mentally. 

This is my story:

First, let me start off by saying I love weed. I think it undoubtedly has its place as a recreational drug. However, my particular usage during some important formative years of my life has been detrimental to my well being.

I started smoking in grade 10 of H.S, when I was around 15. I was a very social and high energy young kid at the time. I considered myself to be a popular and likeable person at this point in time. At first it was great, I would laugh and have all sorts of fun with my friends. I’d enjoy hanging out with people and smoking at parties. It made everything better! So it became a part of my identity.

Flash forward to grade 11…
I was now smoking weed everyday and going to school high all the time. At this point, I was getting high so much that I started to have traumatizing experiences in public. I would get unbelievably paranoid around other people. I would get nervous just walking through the halls at school. I stopped talking to anybody outside my close circle of friends. Around this point is when I believe I developed social anxiety disorder. It was clearly something that was brought on as a result of weed abuse. At this point, I had become a quiet kid who would only talk from time to time and was more reserved.

Flash forward to grade 12…
Now I had been blazing long enough that nothing would have caused me to stop. This is who I am now. At this point, I was high nearly all the time everyday (along with my close group of friends). At this point, I was having severe social anxiety in any social setting. I had bouts of depression and ocd symptoms. I would get depressed at my lack of social skills and it caused me to isolate myself more. I only interacted with my close group of friends. I kept getting violently stoned everyday and perpetuating the cycle even further. I basically lost any friendships I had outside my close group of friends because I felt like a guilty stoned loser. Thank god I still had my close friends (I thought).

Flash forward to the year after I graduate…
This is the year when it all came to a head. I was finally unable to deny the fact that I was mentally ill. After leaving school and becoming separated from my close friends, I kept blazing. This was one of the worst years of my entire life. I had become severely depressed. I even started having suicidal thoughts. I was now growing apart from my close group of friends, and I could tell. My mental state was clearly having some sort of impact on my ability to socialize. And my mental state was undeniably brought on by my years of weed use. I had no idea what I wanted out of life, and everyday felt the same: lonely, and depressing. Around this time I even felt lonely around my close group of friends, because they never experienced the things I did. Not to mention this was also the year the COVID pandemic first hit. 

Flash forward to 2020-2021
Ended up doing a lot of reflection during this time. I started to realize how much I have changed as a person since I started smoking regularly. I realized that my mental health sucks even when I’m sober now. I realized that I have social anxiety as a result of so much weed abuse. I realized that I became depressed largely as a result of my habits, which all developed around weed. I realized that weed kept me in a state of contentment, despite all the negative impacts. 


I’m currently trying to cut out weed from my life completely. I still feel sad sometimes when I realize how much weed has impacted me. The stuff I went through… it was all stuff I didn’t need to go through. I experienced mental hardship I could’ve avoided altogether. 

I still wish I would’ve gotten off the train sooner. I know weed can be good if used responsibly, but for me, I can say without a doubt it has messed up my mental health long term.",37

I am currently awake experiencing another wave where my heart palpitations won't let me sleep and I feel like I might have a panic attack if I keep lying in bed. This was every night in the beginning. In a way, its like my brain forgot how bad this used to be. I am sitting here experiencing this and only now remembering the pain and fear and anxiety I used to constantly live in. Its like my brain forgot these moments in a sense. I remembered that they happened but I didn't remember what they felt like until I felt like this again. Its not pleasant. Im also not used to these like I was. I became a pro at this but now that these are fewer its like I forgot all the ways I used to deal with it. Its also a little scary. Thinking you are mostly over something and then having it stare you right in the face. I am super grateful that hey are rare but unfortunately it doesn't make it less uncomfortable in the moment. I feel like I am trying to crawl out of my skin with anxiety and my heart is going haywire which triggers a bit of health anxiety. I've already had my heart looked at by multiple doctors, ekgs, x rays, Holter monitors. The works. Sometimes my brain still thinks there is something wrong with my heart. I can only use logic that is most likely the anxiety triggering this but that only works in non severe moments. When I am all worked up like this, its hard to talk myself down. The only thing that helps a little bit is focusing on my breathing. The catch 22 is that calms me enough to want to go back to sleep and then I wake up again and I'm in the same spot. I mostly wanted to give an update for posterity. I hope you all are well. I will try to come back and post more encouraging things sometime. Its not all bad, its just bad right now.",4

I never had a desire to quit throughout my twenties and fully embraced the typical stoner culture. I was a full time musician and fully believed it helped me creatively and professionally. To be fair though, I do believe there were plenty of positive experiences to be attributed to smoking grass over the years. Time and a place for everything, and what not. Eventually, as many of you know, the shimmer fades and the past few years I would just smoke out of necessity and not necessarily for any real enjoyment. I eventually decided to make a concerted effort to cut back and eventually got down to smoking once a day and that was working well for awhile. Got a fancy new job, got engaged, and things started really moving in the right direction. However in December of 2020 I caught COVID and had a pretty rough go of it. Wasn't hospitalized or anything serious (thankfully) but I did lose my senses for nearly 3 months and unbeknownst to me ultimately developed asthma. Once I recovered I started smoking again and every night would just lie in bed and wheeze myself to sleep, eventually having to go to a doctor and get a rescue inhaler. Fast forward a few months to now and I am going on 3 months smoke free due to the effects it has on my lungs. I hate that it had to happen the way it did and I wish I could attribute my quitting solely to my dedication and will power, but I suppose everything worked out in the end and I really have no desire to smoke again knowing how bad it could potentially make me feel. I'm curious if anyone else has quit post-COVID or has any stories about how it affected their life and journey to quitting. Thanks for all the support!",3

It’s a complete different high. I’ve smoked a fair share of bud in my life and I can tell you that thc cartridges feel like a overwhelming head high and when I smoke regular flower bud it feels more like a full body high. 

My story:
Before I started vaping, I was 15 and I was an insane athlete. As a freshman in high school; I had a 3.7 gpa, I was on the JV basketball team as a 9th grader, and I was the 2nd fastest runner on a STATE RUNNER-UP relay squad in track as a FRESHMAN. I used to be able to run a mile in 4 minutes and 22 seconds and a 5k in 15 minutes!!! I had multiple D1 offers for track! 

Then boom! A year later, I’m 16 yrs. old and i started hitting my friends nicotine vapes. I would never buy my own vape but I would hit my friends Juuls and disposable vapes at school in the bathrooms and out side of school when we would hangout. This lead to me trying my buddies “dab pen” or “thc cart” for the first time in my life getting high. It was an unreal extreme head high, I was spinning , paranoid, I legit didn’t know where I was for a like a hour.. that first time hitting a dab pen scared me from vaping nicotine and thc for a year... Another year later, I’m 17 years old and I still hangout with my pothead friends and pick up vapes again. This time I’m actually buying my own nicotine vapes about every 2 weeks and a thc cart or “dab pen” every 2 weeks also. From this point on, from When I was 17 yrs. old I was officially starting my addiction to vaping nicotine and dab pens on a daily use, all day. By the time I was 18 I was full in with the addiction, I woke up hit my cart a couple times and would vape nicotine after to start my day. It was almost like the thc cart went hand and hand with nicotine vape. I couldn’t eat with out being high, I would run high, workout high, no exaggeration if I had a dab pen and nicotine I was hitting them almost every hour of the day and I couldn’t go to sleep without being high asf. I went from a nicotine vape lasting 2 weeks to a week and the same with thc carts... at this point I had already quit basketball, and lost all motivation to continue a D1 CAREER in track as a runner, I had legit college offers. At 18 years old, I went from being able to run a Mile in 4 minutes and 30 seconds to DROPPING out of races, and passing out. I couldn’t run anymore like I used to. Vaping ruined my lungs and I wasn’t even realizing it. 

Fast forward to where I am now. IM 19 yrs. old about to turn 20 soon... I now go through a 1 gram thc cart every 2-3 days and I go through a disposable vape with like 800 puffs every few days!! I have felt THE WORST OF the addiction to vaping thc and nicotine. I smoke so much thc that i feel like a zombie all day everyday, I’ve detached myself fully from my family, I lost all of my friends, I gave up sports, I gave up everything I had going for me because I got used to vaping and being “cool” being high all the time made me not think of my problems and I was the “chill” guy with my buddies all the time. I used to think depression was all BS.. now that I’ve been addicted to vapes I legit think of suicide all the time, I have developed unreal paranoia from vaping. I’m at the point, where all I wanna do is chill in my room and hit my thc cart and vape nicotine to escape life. My day by day now usually, consists of vaping all day thc and nicotine 24/7 and play games on my phone or playing gta online and fantasizing a fake life through a video game getting high asf.. also watching YouTube way too much and vaping goes with porn addiction too. Every night I would watch porn and do you know what.. WHILE getting HIGH.... I’m broke asf, I spend all the money I get in a week and blow it the same week or the following week on vapes, carts, and food. I legit spend everything on vapes.

I’m 19 years old..  and these are my symptoms of illness and withdrawal from vaping thc/ nicotine: 
-i wheeze sometimes after hitting the cartridges
-I’ve been in and out of the hospital due to high thc consumption panic attacks ITS REAL GUYS! 
 These panic attacks are so bad that my heart is beating legit so fast i think I’m gonna die, and my chest hurts and I legit feel like I’m gonna die!
-clammy hands all day
-cold sweats for 2 years now!
-memory loss like a mf 
-fatigue!! I legit wanna sit on the couch all the time.. my bones feel weak and I have no energy becuase vaping thc/ nic. Lowers all your serotonin, dopamine, and testosterone!! Without TESTOSTERONE Your body cannot grow physically or mentally!
-paranoia I could be developing schizophrenia at a young age.
I have too much social anxiety I can’t really go out and be at parties anymore becuase I can’t get high like used to when I first started vaping and the only way I wanna go out is high.. 
-vaping is literally a depersonalization... I’ve lost my personality, I’m not happy ever.., I cry a lot, I think of negative thoughts all day..
-I always have pain in my gluts, legs, lower back.. honestly all over whenever i workout. And it’s because the blood flow isn’t circulating correctly because of vape. I’ve actually felt like pins and needles where on areas of my body because of blood circulation and nerve damage I believe liquid thc and nicotine slowly is killing off a lot of receptors in your brain and slowly destroys your central nervous system, which is also why thc carts give u unreal amounts of anxiety.
-my feet are cold all day because of the lack of blood flow
-I’ve experienced chest pains and lung pains that feel like I need to be hospitalized immediately
-I’ve had a continuous throat infection for 2 years now on and off literally like every other month my throat is full of white phlegm and I cannot swallow. I used to think it was from sharing drinks or something. But it’s From vaping. Liquid thc and liquid nicotine build a inner lining of its own infection on your throat. Hence why for me , I have to keep vaping to legit not get sick!! If I quit vape I get throat infections immediately and it’s becuase vaping  is slowly causing cancer! 
-I spit out white, red, and even green phlegm often. And it’s because I think I’m slowly developing cancer or cancer like illnesses. I know for a fact that if I continue at the rate I smoke I will have cancer in 10 yrs or less if I don’t quit 
-insomnia when withdrawing is another level if you smoke thc and vape like me daily you will have unreal thoughts racing all the time and so fast. Whenever I quit the first night is so hard that I’m punching my face in the pillow screaming at my self!!
-aggression with withdrawing is on another level too.. I’ve never done any serious drug but don’t let anyone tell u vaping liquid thc or liquid nicotine is any different. It’s the same addiction mindset. I get so angry during withdrawals that I like hate my family I hate anyone that won’t get me a vape pretty much.. it’s like I’m j mad at the world but so mad... I’ve punched walls in, I’ve broken shit, punch myself in the face really hard, scream uncontrollably. 
-withdrawal cravings have caused me to steal money from my family just to get vapes. I used to tell myself this was okay.. “you can pay them back” no. I was j a pure addict too innocent and young to realize it.

-loss of appetite completely when withdrawing I Can’t even eat regularly at all without being high.

-I legit hate myself because of vaping I’ve never had the depression I feel inside ever because of vape and I want to change it! 

AS I type this note if you made it all the way here. Then you might be like me.. your not alone addiction can happen to anyone look where I was in my life and where im at now. Don’t lie to yourself LIQUID THC “dab pen” is DIFFERENT than smoking flower bud. It’s cancer in a stick and if you r addicted be ready for the gates of hell to open up when you try to quit. This stuff isn’t regulated like it should be.. I was apart of young generation that was able to get these stupid liquid nicotine’s vapes and dab pens.. I seen the spread in my own highschool as vape was spreading across teens around the world. If your are addicted and experience anything of what I’ve told you above. Try and Quit now or these little plastic batteries made in WHO KNOWS LAB.. MIGHT get the best of you. I hope you find the toughness and strength to quit. It’s hard I know. I’ve tried 1,000 times and I still can’t. I’m gonna try and quit again this time for the last. And I hope you can too. A better life is ahead of all of us “vapers”... you and I deserve to be happy. Lets go after it!",19

Choosing to get high and do absolutely nothing instead of working on my art..my business..my career. I saw a post about how we only do just enough to get by and that rang so true, only working enough to afford to smoke. This cannot be what life is, I went through my entire teenage years preaching about how great marijuana was and now that I haven’t taken a single hit in about 4 days now. Wow. What a difference it makes to be clear and present every day. I can’t eat or sleep well but that’s been common on here and I can fight through that, what’s bothering me is my motivation. I still don’t feel like doing anything, is this clinical depression? Or should I wait it out and try to force myself to do things gradually? I smoke nicotine too i was hoping I could take things one at a time and kick that habit next.

On June 11th was the last time I saw my son, because the mother picked him up at his day care for her weekend and never came back with him, and since I haven't heard from him.

Her family is complicit and does not tell authorities where she is, she's not at her house with her parent where she supposedly lives, courts are awfully slow, police and detectives don't do anything more that the DA tells them, and they switched DA, so everything moves slow, not to mention the gender bias in Latin American countries, people constantly telling me ""but the child is with his mother I'm sure he's okay""... No, I can't know if he's OK if the mother is capable of just ghosting me and dissapperaring and removing him involuntarily from his relationship with his dad, who's been living with him since he was born.

So of course I am forced to live a functional live. 1 month before his dissappearence, I took a new job and it was hard to adapt. With this on top, and dealing with courts and police, after 2 months my performance review was awful. I was under enormous pressure.

I somehow came out of it and am pretty safe, but 4 months ago I started smoking pot again because it's the only was I had at that moment of desperation to shut down the pain of not having control over the dissapperarance of my boy. And I haven't been able to have more than 3 clean days since. I feel awful, I don't want to go on, but I am sick of this pain and this absolute impotence in this situation, because I have not enough resources at my disposal to find my son.

I want this to be day 0, and maybe posting here will help me make it through my personal 3 day threshold I know I need to be out of the woods. But I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I've had the intention so many times by now these last few months. And daily I feel guilty that maybe if I got sober I could find him or do more, but honestly, it's just painful and hard to even research this when I'm sober.. And as a reward I wind up smoking.",7

I’m 2 years sober now, looking back, I really want to share my experience so others can take from my journey and get on track faster…my last post had an outpouring of response and it really brought me back and remembering how dark this place could be, and how important it was to me when I saw the light…

For me, quitting was not the end of the road. it was a step in my journey of continual self improvement, by the time I was done away with relapses I’ve lost 30 pounds, left a toxic relationship and started attending church regularly. 

I’m listing this to show how much of a gap is between here and fully doing away with marijuana. It’s gonna have to be covered by external help and internal improvements. I couldn’t just take away marijuana and keep my life exactly the same because, I’d just be expecting different results while doing the same thing. I had to fill the void I occupied with marijuana. 

I know this sounds hard but in retrospect, it was so worth it and in a sense, so damn easy. Just like the next person, I want to be strong and I want to have meaning. Every step I took reinforced my commitment and fed me the real, instant gratification to keep going…

I took my very first step by doing things and then smoking. Making weed a reward for getting something done… I started putting myself before mj in life, instead of the other way around.

I’m going to keep sharing, and keep learning how to better communicate myself in this community. I hope you can apply my experience into your own struggles and draw strength.",11

I’ve been smoking for years and smoking daily for almost 2 years.

I guess knowing how easy it can be for me to slip back into intense daily smoking even though I don’t even like the effects anymore is really scary and the more I think about it the more I think it eases me into relapsing.

I dream now which is nice. Overall better quality sleep. So there are some positives. For context I smoked pretty heavy for a few years without going longer than a week without. A breakup made me quit for good after I realized it really didn’t help the relationship. Some nights I chose being alone to smoke then be with her. I just didn’t like being around other people while high and I was afraid she’d think less of me if I smoked. Made my anxiety was worse. So there are some deeper issues here. Most of all I used it to escape and run away from my problems. To forget them for a few hours until the next morning. And at one point I chose weed over her. Makes me feel terrible thinking about it because now I want her back but I can’t help but think the damage is done. I quit for her if I’m being honest with myself.

My insomnia is non-existent and I’m sleeping at least 8 hours a night. Dreams are extremely vivid and fun!

My eating is not where I want it, but everyday it’s a bit better. Mostly just have to continue to force myself to eat. BM are still troublesome, but again, better than last week. 

I am getting cravings though. “Oh you’re normal now so you can take a hit.” Amazing how easily our minds can trick us. When they do come, I try to remind myself I’m romanticizing the high and if I actually did smoke, I’d be very upset with myself. 

Went to therapy yesterday and had to accept some hard truths about my ex and really, why I allowed certain behaviors. It was very tough and frankly, not feeling the most confident right now because of it. I wish I had seen it sooner. I love her more than anything, but now realizing how some of her stuff affected me. I by no means blame her for any of my problems, but I can forgive myself a bit for wanting to be in a haze most of the time. 

Took my nieces to see Xmas lights last night and had a panic attack while driving. BUT, I was able to recognize it in my mind and keep it at say a 7 instead of letting it hit a 10. Definitely credit a clearer mind for this. And last night was the first time I felt completely in the moment. Loved it!

Todays goal is to stay busy. Just do something, no matter how small. I’m finding the less I have to do, the more time I have to think. And my thoughts are not myself right now.

2021-12-21 11:48:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rlipiz/weed_and_drinking_altered_my_life/,Weed and drinking altered my life,"41 year old male here, sober from booze now for almost 4 years, 1.5+ for weed. Drank and smoked for about 25 years, heavier on the weed side of things (couldn't afford to drink anymore than I did otherwise I would have, haha).

Obviously, getting sober for me was difficult as it is for many, no surprises there. Stopping weed, or drinking is all about psychology and putting in a LOT of work. For me it was all about coming to terms with certain things. Some things that I had to come to terms with:

\- I just can't use weed or drink in any shape or form anymore, any modification of usage or any plan to moderate will all fail and I will definitely end up back at my old levels (or worse) in due time.

\- There are going to be a lot of reminders, urges and other forms of desire to use again. It's hard for me to admit that, I want people to think I'm fully recovered (and, largely, I guess am in some ways) but I don't believe it'll ever be 100%. My time addicted and the affect it had on me is life long. I believe it gets better and easier with time but I suspect there will be times in my 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s (hopefully I live that long!) where I'll have challenges as well. I hope I never throw the towel in after all this hard work.

\- I need to just be sober and that means I have to face things and stuff I might not want to. Life comes with hard stuff, challenges, bad times, grief. I mean, it also comes with positive things but those are easy. Its the hard things that are.. well, hard and I need to accept that I just need to work through those things without escaping from reality.

\- I have to put in hard work. Weed, and booze, together or alone, made it real easy for me to just ignore all of my responsibilities, or at least not feel bad about not fulfilling them. When I don't do something that I should I feel quilt or shame. Those emotions exist for a reason, it means I didn't (or did) do something that I should (or shouldn't) have! Listening to those help. Instead of just getting drunk or stoned and not taking action I now analyse my emotions and try to figure out what they mean and what action it is that I need to do to help resolve them. Putting in hard work also means continuing to grow as a person in general. Looking for weaknesses and room to grow and taking meaningful steps to gain strengths and grow.

I got sober and I'm in pretty good shape. I'm not going to let my guard down though - the other night I had a weed using dream. I rationalized ""I can handle weed better than alcohol so its okay to have some"". It was a couple of days ago and my addict mind tries to apply those thoughts to my awake life. I'm not having it, and I'm too content with my lifestyle to let it do that but that addict mind, while mostly lingering in the background can still have some influence, if I were to let it.

This post wasn't meant to be negative, but realistic. This has been my experience. I'm very happy and at peace to be where I am in life and I'm so happy to have left all that behind yet I still worry about the future and addiction once again infiltrating my life.

2021-12-21 11:43:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rlimax/day_1/,Day 1,"I smoked the last of my weed yesterday. I've set myself up so there is no easy way for me to get more. I've told my oldest friend, who is hoping to stop smoking himself with the new year, not to give me any and that I'm cutting it out. At my next therapy session I'll make a similar commitment to my therapist, who knows that I've been struggling with using weed to regulate my emotions, especially after a recent break up.

Now I'm making this post, on this sub, as an extra layer of protection and accountability. I don't want to smoke weed right now. Later tonight, I know I will. When I wake up tomorrow with the rest of the week off, my god I know I'll want to. When I am staring down three days with my dad and step mom, yeah, def gonna want to. And a whole bunch of moments in between.

But, I can't ignore the fact that each time I've given in to that 'want' I only find myself high and regretful, wishing I could be sober and think clearly instead. I see how much progress I *haven't* made with my anxiety, my social interests, and my professional development, because I've smoked weed instead. I think the impulse to get high is really the desire to not have to make a choice at any given moment of the day. Instead of choosing to do something challenging/nourishing/caring for myself, I get high and let go of my own ability to make the choice. I just waste that time, instead. It's embarrassing, and it only negatively affects me.

Here's hoping it sticks. I will not smoke with you today <3",5

I live in California and have access to really high potency weed, just a week ago I was waking and baking, smoking this 37% THC weed. It felt like dabbing it was so strong. I've been smoking since I was 15 years old. I'm ready to get to the next stage of life now, really grow up. I don't wanna spend my 30s high af. 

I went cold turkey and DAMN the anxiety was crazy. I don't normally drink (and I def don't recommend this at all) but the anxiety was so intense I was getting drunk the first 4 nights. After the 4th night, my sleep was so shit I decided that was the last day. It was starting to make things worse. I slept really well last night and the insomnia is starting to lessen up, still intense though. 

**Trauma drama**

I've come to realize a lot of why I became such a stoner is because it's been an anti-depressant and mood stabilizer throughout my life. I think without it, I probably would have killed myself or ruined my life from indulging in rage. I've finally gotten to a point in my life where I have matured and grown enough to feel that I don't need it to disassociate from trauma, whether past or present. 

When I was a teen my dad starved me to the point I had to go to the hospital, we had no working shower for almost 2 years, I lived in a flea-infested environment, I didn't feel safe at home. My dad would bully my 13-year-old sister and I would have to defend her. He sexually molested her as a child and she's *so* immensely fucked up from it. I started fighting back once in my teens and eventually, he sent me to jail as a punishment to 'teach me a lesson'. Well... I told CPS in jail what was going on and he lost custody of me immediately. 

In my early 20s, I was able to escape from it a bit, I went hard in school because I knew it was the only way I could get away from my shit family. My father was financially supporting me, from a distance. He literally paid for everything, so I tried to utilize it to my best advantage. The year I applied to Universities, he decided to abruptly pull out all support to sabotage my college plans. He didn't want me to get away from the grips of his control, he initially was trying to convince me to not go to school at all. Well... I got into every top public engineering program in the state of California for my major. Fuck you dad. 

Me and my sister were now homeless, I was taking some gnarly courses because it was my last year before Uni and I had to do that while homeless!! I almost completely lost it. I cheated on my gf, got addicted to 'other drugs' too to keep myself productive while under immense stress, very close to committing suicide. Barely fucking made it into college after all of the work I put in. I started University and was doing okay, just a few months into my first year my sister became schizophrenic and was mentally institutionalized. It was so traumatic I dropped out of school, on horrible terms too. I thought my sister was gone... the lights were on but no one was home... 

I took a year off, just worked a minimum effort job to rehabilitate my mind, and went backpacking for 3 months. I broke up with my gf at the time because I wanted to go my own way. Things were cool for a bit and then march 2020 hit about 3 months after that. I had lost almost everything at that point, I lost my job, had dropped out of school, broke up with my gf (at the worst time), and had no fucking family. My friends were moving and getting scattered around the state for different reasons. I made friends with some new people on facebook at the time, which was cool... until they drugged my drink and almost killed me. My sister started to ease out of her psychosis and was doing pretty well for a bit, but then her bf cheated on her with a prostitute, gave her herpes and she didn't handle it well. Started smoking ""other drugs"" ... the hardest ones you can get on this earth, and she gave up. I tried to help her, *really really really fucking tried...* But she was done. It eventually got to the point where I had to block her phone number, I couldn't deal with it. 

I was so depressed I barely could get back into school (had to take summer classes to show readiness). Literally got in by 0.01 GPA above min hahaha. There was a rental crisis too though (thanks corona), so it was almost impossible to go back to school even though I got back in!!! I did manage to essentially win the rental lottery through and found a place! Thanks to luck and my charisma. 

**Me today** 

I just moved back to University 3 weeks ago. I have an amazing place with great roommates. I felt that this was the universe giving me one last chance before it kills me. Every day I feel this sense that I survived. I AM STILL ALIVE MOTHERFUCKER!!! I hit the ground running as soon as I got here, getting all of my shit together. 

Now I'm sober, even reducing caffeine. I became an endurance runner in the pandemic and I'm gonna run another half marathon today. Been eating super healthy, cooking my own meals. Every morning I am soaked from night sweats withdrawing but today was the first day I woke up and said ""I FEEL AWESOME!"" and I'm starting to notice my cravings reduce. I feel so in control of my life now. I want to invest all my energy into my real life now and I want to build a life that's so good that I never need to smoke to make myself feel okay. I feel like even though my life mostly has burned to ruins I see it as a blank canvas, and I am going to paint a beautiful picture.",8

It looks like I don’t want to feel anything and prefer to just be numb. & if I’m honest with you that sounds a lot better than everything I’m feeling now. 

I just thought I’d be nice to share that this is bigger than just a drug. But something within us. Are you running too?

Running away from something that you can’t fathom. Something you don’t want to feel anymore. Are you running from your own life? 

Cause I think I am & I want to stop. But at the same time the feelings are so heavy so what should I do? What should we do? If I’m honest I dunno, lets figure it out together.",8

Jacob here 33 years old being on and off the grass for little bit less than 3 years. I believe and would thankfully appreciate your comments why, for who, how are you quitting?

My response is that some day I want to be an excepcional husband and father, and I don’t want to be the role model for them. It’s like and wouldn’t wish it or recommend them to use it. 

Another reason has to be the fact that I’ve quit so many times and relapsed because of cravings mainly. But I hate the fact that in order to do anything I have to take a hit. I don’t think that is healthy for me.

Thanks for listening to me and for sharing if you so please to.

I also now get hungry more often now so that's good cause I kept forgetting to eat. 

And the last change that  was unexpected for me. I am no longer anxious or depressed about anything. I dont know if weeds been ramping up the decline in my mental health or not but like I've been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was 14 so it's been almost 16 years. 😭

It's been a day since I've smoked, and I'm definitely feeling the cravings. Insomnia was part of the reasons I justified smoking, but I realized it wasn't just putting me to sleep; weed is making me sleep through life. I just feel constantly sleepy when I smoke, and I've had issues with sleeping 12-16 hours a day (although I do have MS, which could be contributing to the fatigue.)

On top of trying to go sober, I'm having relationship issues with my boyfriend. I told him about some thoughts I've had that I might want kids, so we could talk through it. He said his current stance is no kids and he doesn't think that will change. Our first 2 years of dating we talked about getting married and having kids. Two months ago he dropped this revelation that he doesn't actually think he wants them. It's really confusing to me, because I've been romanticizing the thought of a family with him. I never really wanted kids before, but talking about it with him made me consider it, and now there's a lot of backtracking. I even got emotional previously, trying to discuss if he'd leave me if I wasn't able to have kids (he said no.)

Anyway, sorry for the tangent. I have general anxiety disorder and issues with obsessively thinking about stuff, to the point of panic attacks if it gets bad enough. I always thought smoking weed helped, but it just keeps me less attentive for a period of time. I feel like I have less anxiety because I can't focus worth shit to overthink stuff, but the reality is it's still there. Instead of coping with the anxiety at the time it arises, I'm ignoring it and it's still building and building.

I hate that I spend money on this shit. I hate that I have to worry about getting caught, or failing a drug test. I worry about the long term affects on my body, and wonder if I would have gained weight if I wasn't smoking and binging. I just want to be happy as I am.",2

07.00-08.00 Wake up, go downstairs. Freshen up lightly in the washroom. Eat a banana, drink a small yoghurt.  
08.00: log on to work (WFH). By this time I was usually rocking a joint or had had my first puff of my bong. Because of the amount & long time I've been doing it, I didn't even get high, only slightly mellow. But that was my 'normal'.

10.00: online team meeting. By this time I'd had another puff or three and a coffee. No one has ever known me working high because no one could see the difference. I was so used to being blazed that all the external symptoms went away (red eyes, slow thinking, ...). That was my 'normal'.

12:00: eat another bit of fruit, toast or cereal. Drinking lots of pop. And ofc, adding another puff or two. Maybe play a game 30-20 mins depending on if my workload allowed it. Every second of it spent in anxiety, because the weed had stopped calming me down LONG ago. That was my 'normal'.

14:30: another small break for a drink, small talk with the SO, petting the pets, and getting blazed for another half hour or so. By this time additional smoking does pretty much nothing - you don't actually feel higher, better or mellower. Your throat & lungs might feel decidedly worse though. But you still keep going because it's a fucking habit at this point, much like everything else you do without really thinking about it. That was my 'normal'.

17.00-00.00: officially off work, eat a freshly cooked meal made by SO (god I love that woman, and I don't deserve her), maybe work a bit more to wrap things up for the next day. Blaze myself with extra huge bong hits that go fucking nowhere except into my savings account to drain it. Play online games for a few hours while hardly having real fun because you're pretty much constantly zoned out. Play a match of Age of Empires 2 with my SO, fall asleep halfway through because my concentration and ability to focus is destroyed. That was my 'normal'.

03.00 finally go to bed not because I'm tired or sleepy, but because it's so late I don't get any meaningful sleep if I don't. Actually falling asleep isn't a problem, the motivation to do it is the issue.  
Sometimes I'd smoke once more ""to be able to sleep"" (sure!). That was my 'normal'.

At this point I'd consumed about 2-3g of weed daily. Considering I live somewhere where it is 100% illegal without medical exceptions or whatever, I paid through the nose for quality weed. Price went up 3x in the last two years and at the end I was paying 600€ for 50g, of which I went through two a month. On an income of barely 2k/mo, that is not sustainable. THIS is the actual breaking point which caused me to quit cold turkey: empty savings accounts, empty checking accounts, and a few bills due. No debts (yet), and I wasn't prepared to fall down that far the hole.

So here I am, just two days later, full of anxiety, stress, panic, boredom and frustration. This morning I physically got rid of all my paraphernalia concerning smoking. I want to get rid of anything that reminds me of it, but EVERYTHING reminds me of it because I used to do EVERYTHING blazed.  
I need to learn to enjoy things again. As far as I've seen on on this sub and elsewhere, it's going to be a long road to recovery. But I WILL do it. I will return my body to homeostasis and find ways to live and be happy. Somehow. Because I want that to be my 'normal'.",131

I have been thinking to quit for a while but I was surrounded by smokers so it was virtually impossible. To the point where my friends were bringing me weed spontaneously, I mean wtf it looked like they did it on purpose. It never has been so easy to find weed as when I was trying to quit.
Anyway long story short, I took an holiday during which I didn’t smoke and stayed sober since.
The first week was easy, no mayor problems but this week…man it sucks. I feel empty, with no emotion but sadness. My mind is foggy and I’m literally unable to make the simplest decision. It also hurt, as my brain is re balancing itself I can feel it doing it, and is not pleasant. The only good thing is that my memory is coming back, now I don’t forget where I put things or what I was doing ten seconds before, which is great!

i’ve been lurking for a bit now but i didn’t know where else i could go that would be free from judgment.

i’ve been smoking carts, both delta-8 and delta-9, for about 6 months now.  i’ve been vaping 5% nicotine for a year. before that, i used to smoke an absurd amount for about 3 years with a year break (due to covid). i am a pretty heavy user of both, i’d go through a cart in a day or two and go through a disposable or a 4-pack of juul pods in 2 days. 

i went on a trip to LA in november and spent every day smoking and eating edibles from dispensaries. i would wake up and immediately smoke before i did anything else and would go through about 4-5 joints as well as hitting the carts and disposable capes constantly.

i never had issues with anxiety/panic attacks rising from smoking weed, regardless of the amount. however when i got back from my trip in LA, i was hitting my dab pen and all of a sudden i felt my throat close up, breathing became shallow, and i started feeling hypersensitive to everything. i obviously freaked out and decided that i would just take a break from both nicotine and weed.

the weird thing is, i kept getting anxiety attacks even when i stopped smoking. it got to the point where i ended up just experimenting and seeing if smoking again would stop the anxiety. instead of helping with the anxiety, smoking made me have more panic attacks and so last week i decided i’d just tough out the withdrawal(?) symptoms and quit for good.

the first two days, i was so nauseous i couldn’t even put food in my mouth or think about it. i ended up making it through by just staying hydrated and eating saltine crackers. i also had this terrible feeling of hypersensitivity and anxiety, almost like i was in a fight-or-flight mode at all times.

by the third day, my appetite started to come back slowly but it was also accompanied by stomach cramps and diarrhea. i also noticed that my anxiety wasn’t as bad, i could hold a conversation with my friends and family without tweaking out. day 4, i decided to spend the day with my family and try and push through this haziness i was feeling in my brain. it did feel a bit better but i still feel tingly and slightly out of body.

it’s now day 5 and i am sleeping better and eating actual meals. the stomach cramps are still there but super slight. although the physical symptoms are all improving, my anxiety has never been worse. it is almost nonexistent when i am spending time with loved ones and i’m distracted but at night, or when i’m alone, it’s almost crippling. my mind races towards so many dark and frankly, unreasonable thoughts that it’s getting harder and harder to keep staying sober.

i know that progress isn’t a straight line and that i knew i was in for a doozy when i decided to cold turkey quit nicotine and weed together, but it is an absolute hell to have anxiety attacks 5-6 times a day. i also know everyone’s timeline is different to having these symptoms but has anyone felt something similar? i just need reassurance that i’ll eventually be back to normal. i can’t imagine living with this dark cloud of anxiety over my head whenever i’m alone.

thank you for reading

2021-12-21 02:43:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rl9gb9/longest_ive_went_without_smoking_since_i_started/,Longest I've went without smoking since I started almost 4 years ago (I'm 19),"Today will mark my first week without smoking. I would say without weed but I had a few edibles to help sleep the first couple days (10mg) although since my tolerance was so high I never really felt them. So today is day 4 without anything. And I'm proud of myself. 

I never thought I'd be able to, especially this early in my life and especially since I currently work at a dispensary (I don't recommend trying to quit while working at a dispensary, It's 10x harder.) 

It was the one thing that was always there for me, the one thing that would never let me down after a long day. But now I have to put it down, it's constantly affecting my mood, my motivation, my drive, my self esteem basically everything. I couldn't sleep, eat or do anything without smoking a bowl first because I felt like nothing was as good sober. I was fully dependent and addicted I felt like I couldn't live without it.

I've been wrestling with myself everyday to quit for the last few months but my brain would keep telling me the same things over and over and over. 

""Why now?"" 
""You're still young"" 
""One more won't hurt"" 
""Dude it's just weed everybody does it""  ""There are thousands of successful people that smoke daily"" 

Well now I'm done listening. I'm fighting with everything I can. I hate the thought of picking my bong back up, and I know if I do I will have the worst high of my life and that's keeping me sober. It's keeps getting harder everyday but I know that won't be forever. 

For anyone trying to quit, it's possible. It's gonna be hard, and it won't get easier. But I truly believe in you, I never believed in myself till recently.",2

First of all, thank you, just for being your human self and sharing your stories and thoughts on this corner of the internet. Before I quit, exactly a year ago, I always felt I was alone with my dependency. Being a part of this community, this self-shaming quickly dissipated.

I smoked for 5 years, from morning till night, with a lifestyle which didn't allow anything else. My life became a rhythm of working, smoking, eating and sleeping. All which took extra effort, like maintaining my social circle, working on myself, working out, was on hold. 

Throughout the last 12 months I became more aware of all the time I have, quiting felt like being left with a blank sheet and confronted with all there is to do now. I got faced with boringness, which I felt as a kid many times, and there was no quick escape left. Transmuting this feeling into stuff I did care about like working out, being in nature, spending time with friends and family and reading / meditation was a big first step of learning myself.
Continuing with that I started with challenges, 30 days of workout, NoFap, coding challenges and other input. Just to keep a competitive edge towards myself and I started to really find a place in that. Discovering slowly what I like and what I don't.

Yesterday night was my latest confrontation with MJ, where I spent time with a friend who remains a smoker. I had a great time cooking good with him, having good conversations, even while he was sparking up. I was in control and didn't have to partake with him, and even though there's still a little voice left in my head who would have liked to, I didn't need to.

My ramblings are a short reflection on the last year and it's something I am writing for myself, but also to give perspective of my journey to you. I have become more active, self-loving, sharp (memory-wise) and wholesome. In my opinion, the crux is how to integrate a new lifestyle, with changed goals and ambitions. Take it slow and allow yourself time to search, use habits as tools for finding the bigger picture.

Take care and I wish all of you happy holidays ahead.
Thank you for just being here.",5

Knowing others are going through the same thing really helps.,"I’ve been a mostly daily, multiple times a day smoker for close to a decade. I’ve tried to quit probably 4-6 times in the last year or so, and am getting closer every time. With each attempt I’m learning more about why I smoke in the first place, what all in life the high and also shame around my “secret” is keeping me from, and how little smoking serves me. 

I broke up with my ex about 5 months ago and knew I didn’t want my addiction (bc that’s what it is) to keep me from meeting a new, good partner. I was successful in totally quitting for about 45 days and loved the feeling, how free I was, how clear I was, how good I felt every day. 

Last month my new partner (who is amazing and who can offer me the life I want to live) traveled for several weeks at the same time I had a pot head friend visit. My brain rationalized that I was going to smoke with her anyway, so I might as well buy a quarter and blow through it.

So here I am again. 6 days sober, feeling like death. Moody, irritable, sweaty, emotional and depressed. starting to get insomnia, randomly nauseous (thankfully I can mostly eat now, just not much), and I freaking SMELL. I’ve had my hands smell in the past, but this time it’s like this weird dry smell just coming out of my pores within a few hours after I shower.

My sleep schedule is messed up, I’m constantly tired, I’m increasingly lethargic, no will to do anything, go anywhere, nothing. Im throwing away everything I worked for to get where I am, and I really am in a good situation: got a good paying stable job, got a great girlfriend, have my own place… everything was going great and for some fucking reason I started smoking and turned into a pothead.

Edit: WOW! Thank you for all the support, I love you! I’m sincerely overwhelmed. So it’s the next day - I threw everything I had in the morning but I had a little rolled leftover from last night. I thought I’d theatrically throw it out the balcony and mark that as me quitting weed, but being the fucking idiot I am I took a couple of hits. Oh well, at least NOW I don’t have anything left. I’m currently 100% certain I absolutely hate getting stoned. It’s not IT anymore. It’s not fun, it’s not calming, it’s not there to “fix the mood”, and I’m just wasting my time on this shit. I just went through all the comments and you guys are awesome. It really helps to know I’m not in this crap alone, that I have someone who’s going through the same thing and who actually understands me. Pot is no longer a hobby, it’s part of my life. It’s an addiction. It’s literally who I am, and I don’t want that. I’ll pull myself together. I’ll probably be back with an update as a support for other people who might be scrolling r/leaves while being high - it’s fucking time to sort our shit out. I took a couple of days off and whenever I get the urge to smoke I’ll take a walk around the block. It’s freezing outside and I hope that will kill the craving and help pass the time.

I started smoking pot regularly in my early 20’s when I was playing in a local rock band. A band member was a dealer so it was super easy for me to get. He eventually got addicted to other things and fell off the map, along with my easy supply. That lead to declined use as I entered my 30’s. No significant withdrawal issues that I recall aside from some insomnia and appetite loss (which is normal for me anyways). I’m not a fan of buying weed on the black market, especially from teenagers half my age, so I smoked very little until a few years ago when States near me started legalizing. At that point, I had a pretty good job and could afford the insane markup on legal retail stores. It was a thrill to go into a store to legally buy something I used to fear being arrested for simply having in my possession.  

These days I have a wife and young child, so I restricted my use to nights after my kid was in bed or occasionally when I had some time to myself; however, overall it was essentially daily usage. Never smoked much at one time, just a hit or two to get a buzz and relax. Always kept my wits about me in case I needed to react to my wife or kid needing something. My latest purchase was especially strong and it lasted for a several months. The potency required me to be very careful with my dosage. 

This past week I ran out. No big deal, I was due for a break anyways. Then suddenly over the weekend I experienced several panic attacks, mostly regarding my job. My job in general is pretty stressful – I have a managerial position and maintain several ongoing projects / people at once. When project needs overlap, things can get hectic. I’m pretty used to it, but for some reason this past weekend I had trouble processing the stress which culminated to the panic. I was in a pretty bad place for awhile, but the acute panic attacks did eventually subside; although from what I’m reading they may not be gone for good yet. 

Outwardly, I seem fine to my wife and family. My wife did notice me look more stressed than normal, but assumed it was purely work related. Honestly, I did feel fine when I was interacting with my family or doing mundane chores / tasks. It’s when I’m alone when I recognize I’m not fine. My brain is in a fog. I don’t feel right, physically and mentally. My thoughts are all over the place. I struggle to focus and honestly I’m making little progress on the work tasks I was panicking about just a couple days ago. I am angry with myself for allowing my use to get me to this state of mind, which further feeds my depression and anxiety. That said, I have no cravings or desire to use right now. 

I think this past potent batch, combined with several consecutive months of constant usage, sent me over the edge into a withdrawal – something I honestly didn’t know exists for pot. When I recognized something may be wrong with me, I researched online a bit and found this community. It's been re-assuring to see that I’m not alone. People of all ages do seem to be struggling with some sort of addiction / withdrawals related to this substance. That said, it’s discouraging to see how little information there is out there given out widespread usage has become.

The general advice here is great: keep busy, exercise and know that things will get better with time. The support here is great too - no judgement.  I used to run 30+ miles week, but that dropped off significantly this past year, so it’s a good excuse to get back on that wagon. I want to see this community grow and information spread to more people who, thanks to expanding legalization, may begin experimenting with marijuana without knowing what could happen over extended use. I’ll do my best to spread the word.

Being a father of an awesome toddler and another baby on the way, I want to be the best person I can be. I had previously thought that habitual marijuana use was harmless, helpful even for managing stress and helping get good sleep (like a glass of wine). But now I’m rethinking that concept. Sure, occasional usage likely has very little negative effects, but I don’t want to head down the path again to where I am now.  Being with my family gives me the best high anyways.",16

I switched over to smoking and it has slowly become a daily habit, even creeping in to earlier and earlier in the day. I’m starting to have the same “done” feeling like I did when I quit drinking. Been doing a heavy dose of self-improvement and the only thing really holding me back from reaching health and career goals is cannabis. It just makes me stagnant and I’m going through the motions each day. Wake up a little foggy with a tummy ache because of the crap I ate while high the night before, go about the day looking forward to smoking alone on my back porch after the kids go to bed. I don’t read or retain any plot from tv shows and movies. I don’t have goals or ambitions. It’s time.

I instantly knew she was right. Even if my symptoms aren't caused by cannabis, being high literally all of the time can't be good either. That was 4 days ago. I smoked through the rest of my stash and consumed all of my edibles. I felt like trash while doing it. I am now on day 1.

I’m having some problems with boredom and sadness now that I’m back home from college on break. I always get seasonal depression and I really just don’t like staying back at home with my parents anymore now that i’m older. I know people always say to pick up new hobbies to fill your time with but the problem is that all my hobbies involve being outside in the summer when it’s nice out and I’ve got nothing to do in the winter time. This it’s usually that much of a problem as when i’m at school that is really the only thing i focus on and i’m fine with that. It can get pretty stressful doing mostly schoolwork and research during the semester but I really put in the work and it’s satisfying to see it pay off. 

However, i’d usually drink with the boys like once a week or every two weeks on the weekends to chill out a bit and forget about school. However, this semester I discovered that I honestly really don’t like drinking anymore. I don’t like how I feel after it when i’m trying to go to bed and it usually messes up my stomach the next day. Also over the summer I decided to stop taking my medication. The doctor diagnosed me with anxiety and depression which I think is kind of a joke as I feel everyone suffers with those things but I feel like maybe when I way smoking I was somewhat self medicating but just always taking too big of a dose. 

Overall I feel like my life is definitely better now than it was a year ago by a lot. I’ve gotten onto of my shit a lot more and am more motivated, got a girlfriend, and looking for co-ops for the summer and next school year, and am overall more motivated to live the life i want to. However, I feel like im still not able to blame weed for holding me back since I got diagnosed with those things only like 3 months after I quit. 

I still had those problems after I quit, and while they mostly went away for the other medication, by that logic weed didn’t cause all of those problems and therefore shouldn’t start them again. I know that sounds like a horrible idea, but I just miss some of the introspective parts about it and I think that maybe if i used something like delta 8 and limited my use to a couple times a week then it wouldn’t be as negative for me. I feel like the hardest part would be to make sure I don’t impaulse use it during the week but I think that since i’ve been sober for so long I could better control it now.",2

I hate how it makes me feel now. I have a lack of motivation when I’m high. Every time I have mundane things to do (go to the warehouse, go the grocery store, post office, etc) I always told myself “to make this more interesting, I am going to get high while doing this super boring task” and I’ve become so disillusioned and should stop running away from problems and responsibilities.

I first smoked when I was 14 years old, and soon after it became almost a every weekend thing. When I was in high school it was something I always looked forward to. Getting around the fire pit with my best buddies passing around the bong and cracking jokes, it was some of the simplest times in my life. Young with no responsibilities just worrying about having fun. By the time I was a junior in HS I was smoking almost everyday with my sister. It was one thing that we bonded over and I used to love hanging  out with her and getting food after hitting her pipe. Even back then I knew I shouldn’t be smoking everyday, and I would even know when to cut it off and throw away my stash when it was getting unmanageable. I would go months without it and be completely fine. That all changed my sophomore year of college when my roommate got a med card. I was just coming off a horrible break up and was more depressed then I’d ever been in my life. I was also diagnosed with ADHD around this time at the age of 20. Being in a terrible place, I used weed to mask my emotions. Having full access to weed just started with half a joint a night, then to 40 mgs of edibles to enjoy tv more, then to smoking flower all day everyday, to now taking dabs all the time. I’m now 21 and can buy weed legally (live in CO) and this addiction has slowly turned my life upside down. I had to take time off of school because I was failing out due to smoking too much, I can’t keep a job and I’m now in a lot of debt, and I have stolen money from my family just so I can get high and eat. Writing this all down is pathetic but I need to do this to show how powerless I am to this drug. I know because of my ADHD my dopamine levels are lower and have been ruined even more by constant THC, also my impulsivity is unmanageable when I’m high and I’ve done some terrible things. It’s now time to take back my life. Weed has given me relief in my past, but it only hurts me now. I’m now gonna focus on being present in my life and just take everything day by day. I’ve talked to other friends who have quit and from reading these posts that I will probably have trouble sleeping and mood swings. I’ve been resilient and overcame a lot in my past, and I KNOW I’m going to kick this and stop being my own worse enemy. I love how everyone here is taking responsibility for their bad actions and are trying to live a better, stronger, more authentic life. When I see an addict of 15 years quit, I know I can kick my addiction of 14 months.  Thank you all for inspiring me! To a better existence for all of us!!",7

I've been lurking here for a long time now, I can even say how long exactly, but I've been. Redditor for almost 10 years and I joined this sub shortly there after. I guess part of me always understand that I had an unhealthy, dependent relationship with Cannabis, but at the time, the ill effects that i was aware of were limited to the stigma associated with being a 'stoner.' that changed when I started growing. It provided me a community, and essentially and endless supply of free, phenomenal ganja.

I was able to accomplish many of my goals by having compassion for myself. For so long, i thought i could only do certain things if I quit smoking, but when I changed that perception, i found i could do these things and continue to smoke. Probably the worst thing that could have happened in this regard.

Let's take a look at where I am today. At the beginning of the month (Dec. 3) a friend sent me two oz of his organic home grown. I was planning on sharing a bunch with extended fam. this upcoming Christmas week. But I finished off those 2 oz 2 weeks after i got them. This excess has also triggered some stomach issues. I just got back from the GI and they told me I can expect to have severe cramps/diherriea/vomiting every time I smoke now. 

I guess this is partially due to the fact that i have only smoked spliffs for the past 10 years. The total smoke has really fucked up my stomach lining and aparantly done some intestinal damage as well.

I don't really know what to do, I've been smoking at least 2 grams a day for at least 10 years. Everytime i think about quitting i get all sweaty and feel like i am about to panic. I know a large part is due that the cannabis and nicotine addictions are married, and that I am feeling symptoms of both. 

I was so shitty to my dog today, I hate how cruel I am when I try to quit and worry this is the person I will be sober. I know that's a bit ridiculous, but without the calming affect of cannabis will i even know how to control my emotions anymore? 

But I can't be the person the can't share anymore. I can't live in agony just to have a fix. 

But i legit feel like i cannot cope. Even my healthy coping mechanism like yoga and journaling feel colorless and unsatisfying without a spliff to reward myself.

I see all these people talk about how much color and energy has come into their life now that theyve quit, but the longer I go the more I seem to hate myself and want to die. 

I guess I'm just looking for what has worked for others to get their mind of things, especially forming new habits without Cannabis involved.

I'm really hoping that one of u former spliff smokers has some good advice for dealing with the nicotine avarice as I feel like the sun from the plant in Rick and Morty is shouting out me to smoke a cigarette.",3

I’ve been an off and on smoker for about 10 years not, starting in 2010 when I was 15 just taking casually with friends, which slowly evolved into an everyday thing once I turned 18 and graduated. Since then I’ve spent most of my life high, but the few times I did “quit” during those 10 years I would see the usual improvements: sharper thinking, becoming more social, the vivid dreams that slowly go away, a pickup in production, etc.
I most recently quit in June of this year, the only thing is this time I haven’t seen any of the improvements that I have before. No pickup in energy or motivation, still have severe social anxiety, and 6 months later I’m still having vivid dreams every single night without fail. I’ve also noticed I’m in a constant state of brain fog. It’s hard for me to think of a reply and I find myself stuttering or messing up my sentences often or not replying to a text for 20minutes while I think of a reply which is a problem I’ve never had before.

- I don't drink anymore, I don't think I have an alcohol problem and don't want to take any chances in substituting one addiction over another.
- I'm never bored. I'm always filling my time with things I was always too high to do.
- I got rid of all of my social media. I listen to YouTube at work, and I reinstall Reddit on my phone to make these posts. I also comment on pictures of my niece and nephew on a family photo album app my sister uses. That's as close as I get to social media!
- I've replaced my social media with self care apps. I have various apps I use to tract my health, meditation apps, apps for reading, etc. 


Recovery:

- I AM STILL IN EARLY RECOVERY!! 3 months is a BIG deal to get through, and I'm proud of it. But it's just the beginning. 3 months is the ""detox"" phase, my brain needed the 3 months to readjust to the sobriety I neglected to give it for over a decade. I believe I'll be in early recovery for at least the first 2 years of sobriety. I spent over a decade of my life high, all day every day. It's going to take a LONG time for this to feel totally normal.
- potheads IRL have approached me and have been curious about getting 100% clean from weed. It feels good to be there for someone out who is recognizing their addiction.
- self care is my number 1 priority. When I stop taking care of myself, I increase my likelihood of relapsing.
- I'm always working on improving myself. I'm never aiming to be perfect; instead I'm always looking to substitute my bad habits with better ones. Or just being aware of my bad habits is good. 
- I write 10 positive affirmations EVERY SINGLE DAY. It helps a lot. I have chronic depression so this has helped it tremendously. I felt the effects of it after 2 weeks of doing it with no breaks. I still write them.
- Getting out of my comfort zone makes it easier to be sober when I'm going through some struggles outside of my control.
- I'm sill doing outpatient nighttime therapy at an addiction center 3 nights a week. I don't know when they plan on discharging me.
- I am an atheist and I attend two AA meetings on one day of the week. My therapist at the addiction center wants me to go to them on maybe 2 days of the week when I'm less busy. She also wants me to start doing the 12 steps. I'm reluctant, honestly, but she's the specialist so I need to trust her.
- The community I get from AA is going to support me in long term sobriety. I keep hearing addiction therapists say ""I don't know a single addict who has successfully stayed sober without a support system,"" so I trust them.
- one of my local AA chapters does a free yoga class on the weekend for people in recovery. It's awesome! Even met a fellow pothead in the last class I went to.
- there is MA meetings I want to attend, but they're just harder to get to unfortunately. IRL meetings are way better than online ones.
- I plan on checking in on r/leaves for as long as I can. I see a TON of newly sober people here, which is powerful, and helped me in my first month or so of recovery. I think more long haulers need to stick around. We need to see how ex potheads are doing after 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after sobriety. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to help. I might reply late because I don't log onto Reddit all that much anymore. 

Thank you for reading. I'm hoping to keep you updated on any future progress or slip ups.",60
2021-12-20 10:38:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rkq0af/two_weeks_today_the_dreamsnightmares_are_coming/,Two weeks today! The dreams/nightmares are coming back :(,"So before I started smoking I had crazy nightmares and sleep paralysis and night terrors, stuff like being stuck in my dreams and being taunted by a specific person, thinking I’d wake up only to be thrown into something more traumatic, waking up and seeing a specific and vivid hallucination which seemed very demonic at the time, multiple times. Hearing repetitive and unreal things while I was paralysed like someone breaking into my room over and over again all at once while I would try to get up and stop them but couldn’t. People getting on top of me and touching my body and I couldn’t stop them or say anything. This was caused by ptsd which was really bad at the time but I’m doing better nowadays.

After I started smoking my dreams basically completely disappeared, I had very very few and when I did they were generally super super vague and only lasted for like one dream second. I had one vivid nightmare this year and that’s the only one I can remember.

When I started my weaning process like a month ago I started having vague dreams again of this very foggy and dark realm but it’d be like normal things I’d just barely be able to see or feel or hear anything. 

Last night I had my first actual dream, I woke up like 100x (I thought, but that was in my dream) and went on a plane to England, then I got there and checked out some restraunts, then I was in a car and driving through scary woods, there were demons flying and landing on top of tall trees, I wasn’t in control of the car and felt powerless and terrified. It was like children’s daytime tv in Australia. Super weird. I’ve been waking so tired and I thought I slept literally all day but it was only three hours past my usual wake time. 

I’m really scared to deal with dreaming again. Tbh I don’t plan on sleeping tonight but not just because of that. My phone is being mega slow aswell so sorry for any mistakes",2

The first two months sober were easy for me, but I have been struggling so much the last three months. I find that I'm stuck in the same boring habits I used to have when I still smoked, except weed just made them interesting (habits like watching tv, spending a lot of time on my phone). I don't exactly know what I like to do, so I'm not sure which hobby I could pick up, mostly because my motivation to do anything but sit down and scroll through social media is extremely low all the time. I have no energy for anything. Life feels so insanely boring and I've also started realising how much I actually dislike myself. Especially with my country going into another lockdown now, causing even more boredom than usual, this makes me feel really depressed. 

Anyone who has been through similar emotions have any useful tips for me on how to make life a bit more bearable without pot?",7

I slipped out only smoking weed a few times but then I was introduced again to the spliff and the last 6 weeks I have been indulging, let’s be real I have been addicted.

But now I’m back out. Morning 1, eating a bagel and coffee..
And just honesty trying to get through the day. I know the night sweats are coming, but I just don’t care. I gotta get through these days. The first week. So I’m here for some support. Remembering how good it is to feel
Good. Remembering that the things I want in this life aren’t enhanced by such savage routine smoking. Im making a vow here to hold myself to though even writing about weed makes me want to hunt down a spliff but I know the day would just melt into the last.

2021-12-20 10:29:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rkptc5/just_a_reminder_to_people_that_being_free_from/,Just a reminder to people that being free from weed and being sober is enough.,"When I first quit weed almost 2 years ago I was expecting for a new person to emerge out of the ashes of sobriety, I read all sorts of uplifting stories on here of people who pushed through the withdrawals to come out a greater version of themselves as if by magic by just getting sober! People going back to school, going to the gym and being more mindful .That may be true to some degree but on the contrary I found myself exactly the same as I was before mentally… but perhaps less foggy. I’m still the same old person, I’m lazy and I’m sometimes unmotivated to do anything other than my usually routine but that’s just who I am and I’m happy with that at this moment in time.  If I want to succeed further, well that goes past just staying sober, what makes my realisation comforting is that I’ll be able to make changes in my life a lot easier knowing I’m not addicted to weed anymore.

Even though I say all this it doesn’t take away that I’m so proud of myself for sticking to something which I initially found very hard, I’m happy I have more money in my account to spend on things and people other than just weed, I’m happy with the relationships which have grown stronger as a result, I know my bipolar will be better handled, and more importantly than anything else I LOVE the feeling of freedom I’ve given myself.

So what I’m trying to say is; if you’ve quit weed and you feel no massive changes in your life don’t feel too bad in yourself because the fact you’re staying sober is the greatest achievement anyone in this sub can have and you should be proud every day you don’t smoke the stuff.

Peace people,and remember the mantra - “ I won’t smoke with you tonight.”",28
2021-12-20 10:28:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rkpsj2/day_7/,Day 7,"I can’t believe I’m starting my 7th day clean. Yesterday was a bit of a challenge for the energy levels. There was about a 5 hour period where I could barely keep my eyes open and my brain felt like it was running on empty. Ate some food and a couple hours later the fog was slightly lifted, but still EXHAUSTED. 

Slept for 8 hours and had some of the most vivid nightmares to date. I loved it!!! Wish I could remember them now, but they were so real at the time and I’m taking that as a positive my body is trying to heal myself. Hopefully happy dreams tonight, but I’ll take whatever I can get at this point. 

Was able to eat a bit more yesterday, but stomach is still an issue. Haven’t had any strong cravings to smoke, and the cravings I have gotten, I’ve been able to tell myself that it’s more the anticipation of smoking than the act. I know I’ll feel defeated if I smoke and when I think that way, the cravings subside. 

My depression is not as bad as it was. The hardest part now is as I gain more clarity, I’m extremely mad at myself for past situations that I would have been more equipped to handle had I quit sooner. Im confident now that I would still be with her and happy, had I quit. But she’s with someone else now and as sad as that makes me, I only have myself to blame. I knew weed was inhibiting my ability to be present and help her. A regret I’m hoping will go away with time, but still very real and traumatizing right now. 

Woke up this morning and started saying simple affirmations to myself. I love you. I forgive you. But most important I’m finding is: I’m proud of you. It’s incredible what effect that had on my outlook for the day. 

Im going to therapy later to talk some of this sadness out. 

This the longest I’ve been clean in 2 years and that makes me even more proud of myself. 

My advice today is don’t be too hard on yourself. If you’ve read this far then you can tell I still struggle with that. There’s nothing I can do to change the past, so I’m making damn sure I don’t repeat the same mistakes moving forward. Love yourself. Be proud of yourself for wanting to quit. It may be hard, but at the end of the day, you have to live with yourself and it’s much easier to do that when you can forgive yourself. 

Again, I want to thank this incredible community for everything you’ve shared. I would not be on day 7 without you guys. Knowing I’m not alone and seeing these inspiring stories makes me want to keep going. Thank you thank you THANK YOU. 

I will update you all tomorrow on my progress and want to leave you with something another user wrote that has been powerful for me:

You know what happens when you smoke weed? Nothing. 

I love you all and could not be more proud of each of you❤️",3

I was drinking so much and so often that I probably would have been dead in 5 years. It's still a daily struggle - I was a heavy drinker for over 10 years, and alcoholism runs in the family. 

Fast forward to now. I am no longer drinking 5 litres of beer a night, but I'm consuming cannabis products - mostly drinks and edibles - on a daily basis. My sleep sucks, my brain feels like mush, I'm eating like shit, my mood is off, and it's expensive bc cannabis products are taxed to fuck where I live. I suppose from a harm reduction standpoint, I am doing better. But in reality, I just replaced my drinking problem with a cannabis problem. 

I want to know what life is like without having to rely on substances. I want to feel the highs without needing to ""supplement"" the experience. I want to feel the lows without needing a crutch. I guess I'll find out soon enough because I quit cannabis yesterday.",6

2021-12-20 03:58:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rkixe0/this_wasnt_the_life_i_wanted/,This wasn't the life I wanted,"Hello Reddit.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9, I have never been diagnosed with any other psychiatric disorder. However over the past few years I've gotten involved with other drugs, one of which included cannabis.

Cannabis was my go to. As soon as I wake up, throughout the day, at work, once I get back home, and before I fall asleep... It was a never ending cycle it felt like.

In the back of my head, I was always kind of disappointed in myself. I didn't like being a substance user, it might have made me feel good, but in the long run it often ends up messing up the good aspects of my life. I would do a lot of stupid things too. Things I didn't nessarcarily realize we're stupid until I took a step back.. and pull the curtains away for myself.

Like over the summer, me and my ex girlfriend went to Florida. We went on a plane. I was smoking dabs at the time, and I remember I literally told her some stupid shit like ""I won't go to Florida if I can't take my dabs"" pretty much sending her into a panic. I should have just left it at home. I did end up sneaking the dabs and other drugs onto the plane. But guys, it just feels so selfish. Being completely sober for just these last few days has just made me realize I've been living a huge lie.

Jumping back to the ADHD thing, over the last few years my mental health has slowly started to turn into a more manic, and depressive state.. where I'll either try and do everything all at once.. or I'll sit around and let life pass me by.... I often thought this was gonna be permanent.. but after only two weeks of abstaining from drugs.. and just 3 days off cannabis.. it's almost like my depression is gone.. bro I can see the fucking light at the end of the tunnel and it just keeps getting closer.. faster and faster.

I also thought I grew out of my ADHD.. but no.. It was just masked by the drugs. Today at work was amazing. I had more energy in this one day.. then I've had in years. I was literally running, spinning, getting everything fucking done.. I felt like a teenager again.. 

The withdrawals are almost non-existent too?? I just have cravings.. but I can fight them.. literally all I have to tell myself is ""it doesn't work for that"" and I don't smoke... Because a lot of it is just the anticipation to smoke.

I used to get so so so excited when I got a new bag of weed or dabs, like literally manic, jumping up and down.. so fucking hype and excited to use.. and then.. once I did.. it wasn't any fucking different.. it's not like my problems weren't still there.. it's not like everything's fucking fine and dandy just because I'm a little high... I still have things to do that I didn't do.

I have a list of goals for next year.. they are the same goals I had this year (lol), but this time I'm determined to make my life one worth living.

I'm so grateful to everyone who was gave me words of encouragement and helped me with questions I had.. 

I'm gonna end it off with, if you are thinking of quitting.. just quit. If you think the negatives out weigh the positives, but yet you keep using... Address that you have a problem.. and find out how you can work on fixing it.

I hope everyone has a great day.

The last 4-5 days I've been thinking of going to the dispensary, buying a pipe and a bag and 'enhancing' my days off.  Since I've quit weed I've found employment that I like, lungs have cleared up immensely, brain fog is almost gone, I've been taking care of my health, I'm being pro-active in tasking long ignored 'life problems', I have nightly dreams that I remember, my fear of being out in public has vanished, I generally wake up feeling 'crisp' and I've been zipping around on my electric skateboard which takes a lot of dexterity and concentration while I'm heading sideways at 30mph.  

In my mind's eye, I imagine the enjoyment of being high on a sunny day in SoCal.  I'm not going to go to the dispensary and I'm not going to smoke again...it was a fucking slog to get to the point I'm at mentally...where I'm not white knuckling the craving to get high...and where I'm actually, generally enjoying myself/life.  I know this craving will pass and I'll be back 'on the path 100%' soon, but it's like the old Greek sailors story of the Sirens calling sailors to their destruction on the rocky shores...it's just so fucking seductive right now...but I'll sail pass.

I went to college in the San Fernando Valley, which is a little North of Los Angeles, California. Something you should know about LA is there is a dispensary on just about every corner and that was true around my college campus as well. There were about 10-15 dispensaries within a 2-mile radius of the campus. 

Throughout that first semester, I felt like everything was going great... I was passing my classes, had some friends in my dorm, I was going to some parties here and there... and I was getting incredibly dank weed. Life seemed great.

The first time I bought a 1/8 of weed I remember thinking to myself.. ""that's it?.. I spent $35 on this?!"" it seemed like a tiny amount of weed for the money I spent, and I was not rich at all nor did I have a job. Looking back on it, I should have just stopped right there and been like this is an absolute waste of money... but I didn't.

I started smoking a small amount here and there in the afternoons and eventually, over the following weeks and months, it turned into daily smoking and eventually dabbing concentrates all day and night. Not only was I dabbing every day, but I was also selling weed to support my habit and failing all my classes...  

Fast forward around halfway through the second semester of my freshman year, I was miserable and my life was in shambles. I had switched roommates 3 times, I was failing my classes, broke, had no friends, and was mentally crippled by the amount of weed I was smoking. 

I had no functioning memory, I couldn't remember anything I learned in school, it got to a point where I would set my phone down and 10 seconds later I thought I left my phone in class. I had a hard time eating and was losing a lot of weight rapidly. I was an absolute shell of a person.

I ended up in a hospital one night because I had skated like 20 miles away from my dorm and ended up in someone's backyard in their dumpster... literally was having a psychotic episode from weed and had voices in my head telling me to go here and there. 

My parents showed up at the hospital the next day in tears all while I was still emotionless and thinking everything was a false reality. They checked me out of college that same day and moved me back home. 

I spent the next few months recovering from weed and getting my mind back...

Well, let me tell you... from 2015 until now I have been battling a severe weed addiction on and off. I think part of the reason why I never got to the point of having another psychotic episode or staying sober was that I was living at my parent's house where I was able to enjoy homecooked meals with my family, and I was able to be around my parents which kept me grounded. 

I re-enrolled in college about 6 months after I came home and secretly used weed throughout most of my college career even though my parents thought I was clean. I even bought fake pee to pass the drug tests my parents would give me. It was horrible and the entire time I was wasting my time and energy trying to get high. 

I ended up dropping out of college after barely completing an associate's degree after 4 years and moved across the country to try and work with some guys I had been working with remotely doing computer programming. That didn't work out. I had the choice of moving back home with my parents or staying where I was and figuring things out like an adult.

If I'm being honest, some of the best and most productive times in my life over the past few years have been the spurts of sobriety where I didn't have any weed. From July 2019 to March 2020, my life was actually going great. I had been working on starting my own online marketing business and got an apartment with a roommate, and I was working out regularly and gaining lots of muscle. 

I had a life, I was going out on the weekends, and most important of all I was able to concentrate and work with a healthy mind.

It wasn't until COVID quarantine hit that my gym closed down, the parks closed down, and I felt trapped. My roommate at the time was smoking some absolute garbage weed that looked like it was grown with PGR when I had promised him I would find him some good weed. 

That's when everything started going downhill again. Slowly but surely I was witnessing myself dive back into my addiction which continued up until very recently...

Throughout that time from when COVID started, I could have spent all that time, money, and energy focusing on my business but instead, I was getting high and my business was going down the drain. I was making enough money to pay for bills, rent, food, and weed... but I wasn't growing at all in any facet of life. 

During the last 2 years battling my weed addiction, I've missed opportunities to make small fortunes multiple times, I lost all my gains in the gym, I lost my relationships with friends, girls, etc. and I was spending a ton of money on weed and worst of all, my mind and memory felt like mush all over again. 

Every time I wanted to learn a new skill or read or book or do anything that required any brainpower, I simply couldn't do it. I just felt fried.... and I know if you're reading this you probably know what I mean. I couldn't even facetime my own mother because I was high all day and night and didn't want her to see how rugged I looked from the lack of quality sleep I was getting. 

Up until around 2 weeks ago, I decided I needed to reach out for help and started therapy. I also quit using weed and have been dealing with the withdrawals recently, but I'm starting to feel better. I've been sleeping like 12 hours a day and my lungs are starting to clean themselves out. 

My memory and creativity are still lacking, but I'm all too familiar with the process of getting sober as I've relapsed and gotten sober on and off about 15 times since that psychotic episode in 2015. I'm sick and tired of going through this vicious cycle of starting up this addiction and throwing away all the progress I make during the time I'm sober. 

I could go on and on about all the negative things weed has done to me, but I want to leave you with a final message. 

If you plan on doing any sort of work that requires constant brainpower, creativity, and focus like being an artist or a writer (I'm currently pursuing digital art as a career now), and you've struggled with weed addiction in the past. Avoid it all costs. It will rob you of your ability to learn, memorize, and progress in your career. 

You may not notice it holding you back if you already have some success, but I've experienced firsthand that weed will take 7-8 months of hard work learning a new skill and throw it all down the drain. 

I no longer desire to get high and because this is literally probably my 15th-20th time getting sober, I can confidently say I am done for good, and I am internalizing it every day. Thankfully I now have the help of a therapist and I'm starting to go to AA meetings weekly to keep myself in check, which in the past I never did and never had anyone to help keep me accountable.

I hate how weed is marketed as an innocent drug and promoted by celebrities, rappers, etc. when in my first-hand experience it's extremely damaging to the mind. Especially if your career demands mental power or if you don't have the highest self-esteem. Most of the friendships I've built over the last few years have been through weed and I've noticed nearly all of the friends I had that were stoners are doing pretty poorly in their lives right now while they still smoke weed or even worse, doing harder drugs. 

Overall I just want to encourage you to appreciate the sheer fucking strength and courage it takes to get and remain sober after quitting. I know that little voice in your head is telling you it's ok to get a little high once in a while after being sober a few months because everything seems fine... but I promise you it's a very very slippery road that I've fallen down too many times.

I'm ready to experience life again and my relationship with mary jane is coming to an absolute end until further notice. 

If you've made it this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to read a small summary of my story and I'm fighting for you if you're struggling to stay sober. I'm praying that we both find peace and happiness in our sobriety. I encourage you to seek professional help to see if you can get to the bottom of why you use weed to numb yourself as I am on that journey with my therapist now. I'm excited to see the progress I make in the coming months and I am looking forward to making an update post next year with all the great things I accomplish in 2022 being sober. 

There's so much more I wish I could type out here, but I'd be happy to go into further details in the comments, just let me know if you have any questions.

I've been lurking this sub for the last few months and I would read threads while I was high which would immediately make me regret getting high. It's been an absolute blessing finding this sub and I genuinely believe it's played a big role in me deciding to get sober from weed for good. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Started smoking in college and eventually had a psychotic episode that left me in the hospital after being high as a satellite for 6-7 months straight. Dropped out of college and struggled on/off with weed addiction for the last 5-6 years while trying to build a business and create a life for me and it's been 100x harder than if I would have remained sober. 

Weed completely halted any progress I was making in my life and was a wrecking ball to my mind, memory, focus, and happiness, which led to my personal and business life severely declining. 

When I decided I wanted to switch careers I was unable to retain most of the new skills I learned over the past 7-8 months and felt completely destroyed mentally and physically from weed.

The lesson is if you're questioning what you want to do with your life. Weed addiction is going to prevent you from growing personally, financially, and spiritually; Especially if you are in a field that requires you to be present, alert, and sharp. 

Stay sober and get high from chasing and accomplishing your goals instead of a stinky green plant. 

Love you all,

Peace",108

2021-12-19 20:24:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rkb55t/cannabis_and_depression/,Cannabis and Depression,"I’ve been a mostly daily cannabis user for the past 15 years aside from the occasional t-break, job interview drug test etc. For the past two years I have been a medical patient with access to a wide range of products. Throughout the pandemic I noticed my depression was getting increasing worse which I basically managed by using my vape pen. This fall my depression felt like it was getting worse and my moods were increasingly more volatile which made it difficult to commit to doing anything as most likely I’d be feeling a bit like shit and not up for it. I felt convinced I was just depressed due to all the covid related issues etc and that weed was the only thing that helped my depression.  

I listened to Dr. Anna Lembke on Andrew Huberman’s podcast and was truly inspired by her message. She claimed that the majority of her patients who were addicted or dependent on a substance or even technology were able to get rid of their depression by abstaining for a period of 30 days. I’d highly recommend listening to the whole podcast as well as Huberman Lab in general. 

At day 21 I can happily report that I have had the least issues with depression and the most stable moods in quite some time. I feel like I am in the best place physically, emotionally and spiritually that I have been in quite some time. 

The first days were a bit challenging and I have definitely hit some road blocks - but I certainly can notice a massive difference in my mental well-being. Previously I had loved edibles but noticed the days after a heavy dose I would feel quite depressed. I stopped edibles and thought I could use my vape pen more moderately but abstaining from cannabis altogether has been the best thing for me. 

My mantra for this period of abstaining has been discipline = freedom. I learned this from Jocko Willink. If I am feeling stuck I listen to his songs on Spotify and try to get active whether it’s going for a run, working out or just walking my dogs. He’s been on a bunch of podcasts as well (Tim Ferris’s one is great) and I have found his message to be a big help. 

Not sure if anyone will read all this but I hope it could help. I really never thought cannabis was exasperating my depression but I am certain it is. Exercise has been the best thing for me over these past 3 weeks and have tried to do something twice daily. I can’t recommend getting after it hard enough - I’ve started doing kettle bells, and YouTube HIIT/ low impact workouts on top of yoga, meditation and a shit ton of water. Also Wim Hof breathwork and as much time as possible outside in nature. I never thought I’d feel this good 3 weeks ago but feel committed to stay this new path.

2021-12-19 19:57:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rkalaa/let_us_give_this_a_try/,Let us give this a try,"Hey all, just wanted to put my story out there for anyone who wants to read it, or maybe it's just for myself. Two days ago I decided enough was enough, I was laying in bed high as a kite with chest pains and shrugging it off as 'just being high' which, I'm sure it was as it only ever happens when I'm high, but in that moment I decided I needed to quit, I've been smoking carts practically every day for the past two years, aided by my coworkers always offering me a hit, I eventually ended up buying a cart to give it a shot, and holy hell was it a blast, I was high in the shower, I was high when I was driving, I was high when I was working on peoples cars, high at social events, and it was probably the best time I can recall in my life. Then I ran out, and that was okay... for about 2 weeks... I must have added 20 drug dealers on snapchat and of course ended up getting carts a few days later, after that it's been daily usage.

Then I noticed the downside, I'm 21 now and still live with my parents for context, I stopped being able to look them in the eye in case they knew, I started getting super paranoid when I was driving, and overall I guess everything about me changed, I thought it was helping... it really wasn't, the only thing I can say it's done for me is help my social anxiety, and not really even that much.  


This past year has been really eye opening, around March I said I'd stop... that lasted all of 4 hours, I kept the carts around and would always make some excuse to smoke ""oh well i'm really not doing anything today fuck it why not"" so on so forth, fast forward to this month, and I realize at least part of the harm it's done me, I hardly go out, When I go out I'd rather be anyone else, my personal image of myself is destroyed (mainly because of these reasons, I've never really been a fan of my appearance) I quit my job to do doordash, and while it is definitely a better job I think I'm starting to realize why I quit was so I could be higher than I could get there every day.  


I can't really think of anything else to add onto this, I'm sure there's more but this post is already long enough, I threw away all of my carts that I could find, confided in my girlfriend about my problem using, and she's been very supportive, but weed has made me lie to her in the past, so I guess this post is just to keep myself honest, or maybe it's to truly mark my dedication to quitting, the past two days have been hell but I can't let myself fail, I have a feeling if I keep going down the path I am, i will be homeless in a matter of years, or worse who knows. Thank you for everyone who's read this, as it truly does mean something to me, I'm sure I will be back here either lurking or giving the occasional update, farewell and happy holidays to all :)",5

I remember the night I found this subreddit like yesterday. I smoked a bong, went to sleep after playing PS4 all day, bloated after eating too much chips and ice cream and asked myself: is it really so hard to go to sleep sober? Where is this curious, intelligent and creative guy I once was? Why my life isn't moving forward?

So I opened Google and typed: ""how to quit weed?"" and that's how I found subreddit that saved my life. First week was awful. I couldn't sleep, didn't want to eat, even though I love music I couldn't stand any sound. I remember that first week was like a Saturday hungover after Friday party. Except that Friday lasted 10 years. It was a bottom I needed to bounce off of. Every day after that I was discovering parts of me I thought were long gone. Every day was giving me more power and will to live. I was learning who I became and how to be that person.

I know this post is meaningless, but I feel like I'm visiting old friends after a long trip and finally letting them know I'm alive and well. And I also want to say to all of you on your first days and weeks that it gets easier. I know you're sitting alone in your room trying to remember that human you once were and you're worrying he'll never come back. But he will. And he will be stronger than before. Your intelligence will come back. It'll be easier to talk to people. You'll remember passions you abandoned years ago. Years of suppressed emotions and feelings will hit you at once, and while at the beginning it will be overwhelming you soon will realize that it's wonderful to laugh and cry.

You will escape this glass cage from which you can only watch world moving while standing still in the fog.

Doesnt feel like much changed mentally but i feel more sharp and focused. My advice is try quitting with a friend so you can motivate each other and when you want to smoke just think about it as if you smoke right now you will lose all your progress and definitely will start smoking daily again. Good luck to everyone trying i think its easier for me because im skinny and THC is probably leaving my system very quickly. Was hard the first week but as time passed cravings stopped and life became more fun and interesting as you enjoy the little things like drinking tea, watching a show and playing video games a lot more than you are stoned.

Looking at it now I wasn’t even that sad I failed the entrance exams, I just got high before bed, forgetting about it, and then waking up groggy and fog headed the next morning no having enough mental clarity to be sad about failing them. Every single day I sit, not really doing anything because I’m almost catatonic, running in auto mode barely getting basic tasks done, and I’m fine with it. I’m fine always underperforming academically, having barely any social life, and generally just existing as this vague semblance of a man, a person (barely), who, despite appearing just fine, has no thoughts, no real feelings, because I’m always, ALWAYS, just. a little. high. It’s almost comedic, a pathetic plant, is what is ruining my life? Surely it can’t be this, there must be something else going on. And there probably is, but weed, makes it..tolerable. It makes it something that will be taken care of later, after you get a bit sober, after the coffee that will help me sober up, after I take a little break from doing absolutely nothing. Without it I feel stressed, overwhelmed, truly buried in the tanker truck sized pit of shit that I have slowly but surely dug for myself over the years, but that’s what gives a human drive, these feelings of anxiety are what make a person finally do that thing that they have to do. And yet, despite knowing this, I’m genuinely afraid of being sober, but I hope that soon I will muster up the strength. It’s genuinely not just a plant. Your stories give me a bit of hope, and by writing this I’m hoping to mold that hope into determination. Thanks for reading of you got this far.",3

It has become a full-blown addiction.,"I’m disappointed daily that I keep letting the same relapse happen daily. It’s that bad that I want to quit daily and still don’t - like watching Groundhog Day but with being a perpetual stoner.

Smoking before every possible thing in order to assure that I can enjoy it to the fullest extent. Completely falling short of my potential every day cuz I am avoiding responsibility and smoke to cope.

It’s a vicious cycle and I’m walking away. I’m not mad at weed, I’m not mad at me - but it’s an undeniable hindrance to my personal growth, weirdly enough also my appetite, to my physical exertion, to my desire to leave the house, the list goes on.

Most importantly to me, it’s fucked up my sleep and my dream recall, and I really miss studying my dreams and doing lucid dream practices.

I also really miss what it felt like to be devoid of any “cravings” when I did take the handful of tolerance breaks. It was truly liberating and I always remember looking at my habitual smoking from a distance on those islands of clarity I had and I wondered how I could do that every day…and here we are again. 

I’m 30 this year and it’s time for a new chapter. Smoking was a blast when I had a healthy relationship with it.

So anyways this post is for accountability and for anybody else that’s been there that needs some encouragement to make the next step. I’m right here with you.

Shout out and encouragement to all of you still pushing through the first 6-10 weeks of sobriety. So it begins for me as well. 

Cheers.",53

I quit once for a yr because of probation (for weed)  which I don't count because It wasn't my choice.  After I got off probation I remember the 1st day lighting up. I was disappointed. It seemed my memory of smoking and getting high was better than the reality,  mainly because  I had accomplished so much during that year. I went back to school and earned A 3.8 GPA and things really started to come together for me.
 About 6 months ago I stopped for 30 days and felt great! And then I went back again and got the same feelings by being able to compare a sober life to a life of getting high daily. But by then It was already too lalready too late, I was on the weed train again.
 I've been weed free for only 5 days and I'm feeling like shit just like before.. and I can't wait to start feeling better and live a life of sober mind, so that I can have the energy levels, productivity, being present with friends and family and clear mindedness again.  Over the years I have started to become more reclusive , which is not normal for me since I am a social person. Thank you for all of you that have commented your experiences because it really helps. 
Right now I have different phases I go through. For a few hours I feel great and then a few hours I feel nauseous, energyless, headache, and of course the glorious bonus of having digestive issues. I'm looking forward for the physical withdrawal to go away so I can deal with only the psychological issues, which seems to be much easier in my past experience.
 Although looking back I think there was some value in relapsing because now I have something to compare it too. And I can honestly say that in my opinion there is nothing better than being sober. Being sober pales in comparison getting high every day. It seems that the weed is less destructive than other drugs. It's  not. It's just a slower installment plan to unhappiness. This time I won't go back.  I deserve it and my friends and family deserve it... and hopefully I can help others get through this very subtle yet destructive drug.",40

Thank you all for sharing, supporting, and offering solidarity.
I hadn’t been struggling with cravings or even feeling tempted to use until this morning. Yesterday when I was tidying up (yay for more energy one week clean!) I found an unopened tin of my favorite mints and a bunch of joints. I know I need to get rid of them, and I wish I would have done that yesterday when I was feeling great, because now, I’m having a hard time. My favorite late Sunday morning routine was to get stoned and take a long meandering walk with my dog, and stop for coffee and a treat and read the paper (yes, I’m old).
Thoughts like, “come on, who says you have to give it up *entirely* to benefit from cutting back?” or, “maybe have a one day a week rule, where it’s okay to *just* get high on Sundays” are torturing me! But the thing is, I *know* the presence of those thoughts are because I’m an ADDICT! Weed was harming my life— it simply DOES not do anything positive for me!

I’m committing to my first weed free Sunday by posting here.

One thing the last two years of my all day, every day use took away from me was any sense of pride or self satisfaction. I’ve not been treating myself with dignity or respect , so of course I don’t *feel* dignified and I don’t feel much respect for myself. I know it sounds small, but if I can get through this Sunday without getting high, I’ll have a sense of being proud of myself, and after two years of self loathing, that feeling is what is motivating me to not use today.

Thanks for being here and reading!",5
2021-12-19 13:34:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rk2oqg/heres_to_another_day_1/,Here's to another day 1,"I relapsed again about 3 months ago after attemtping to moderate and failing miserably. I noticed relapsing made me fall right back into a spiral of self loathing which made it harder still to get back on track. So Im trying something different today. I decided to reflect on the entirety of last year instead of putting a spotlight on the failures only

- yes I relapsed twice this year, but its also the first time in a decade I managed to successfuly quit for more than a couple of days. Being sober for 6 months out of a year was never the goal, but its a hell of a lot better than being high all year round like usual

- I started working out to replace smoking in the evenings. To my surprise I got really into it, to the point where I maintained my workout routine even after relapsing. As a result Im in easily the best shape of my life right now

- I actually managed to have a great relationship for a couple of months of sobriety. After years of worrying Im incapable of forming any kind of healthy bond it turned out that it was my smoking that was holding me back. Sure, it didnt work out in the end, but at least for the first time in my life I can say it wasnt my fault. Thats gotta count for something

Self-flaggelation didnt get me very far. Maybe its time to cut myself a little slack",8
2021-12-19 13:32:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rk2n02/here_i_am_trying_again/,Here I am. Trying again,"I’ve posted in here a couple of times from quitting, to reasons why I continue to smoke and quit again. I’m 35 and have been smoking since I was 18, with a few brief stops in between. I quit for 6 months 3 years ago and felt good, but it was also the year my dad died of cancer. I moved him into my home and cared for him until the end. I started again to cope by smoking and sleep so I didn’t dream of him dieing over and over. It’s been my crutch for so long. I’m, I guess what you would call a functioning stoner. I work, have 2 kids, a mortgage and am friendly in my community. I hide it from all of them though. I realized how unhappy I really was being high every day and how fast it made time go with a numbing existence. It made me anti social and I think depressed overall. It sucked me into a shell of not wanting to leave the house. I abused it. It’s absolutely mentally addicting. 

I lost my sister to an accidental drug over dose in April and it’s really messed with me on top of still dealing with losing my dad. I know I can’t keep numbing myself from pain and grief. I quit smoking cigarettes 9 years ago because I don’t like habits having control over me and weed has had total control. I have gained weight, unmotivated to be healthy and it led to health issues, on top of guilt that I could be a better mom and role model.

I want to be better. I don’t want my life to continue flying by in a hazy blur where months just zoom through like nothing. I am on day 5 and am really pulling through stronger this time with the mentality of wanting a healthier life all the way around. My kids are in high-school and I don’t want to miss it being stoned and wake up one day literally wondering where the time went. I want to fill my extra time with hobbies again that I used to enjoy. Weed used to be more of a fun, creative activity. Now I don’t even enjoy it. It became habitual and knocked me out without the dreams I hated.

I dreamt of my dad dieing on his death bed last night and my sister haunting me the night before, but I know it’s only my subconscious telling me I’m expecting to and I haven’t properly grieved them both. I’m a positive person though and will get through it. I know I’m strong. I love this sub and it’s been helpful. I read a lot of posts and it’s good to know I’m not alone. We all got this.",2

My life is going to shit, my college funding just got taken away so that’s fucked me. Honestly I just want to die. Everytime I find happiness I sink right back to the bottom no matter how many time I try.  

Edit: for anyone that discovers this post at a later time, it definitely gets easier. I’m about 3-4 weeks in I believe and I feel great. Mental clarity, appetite back fully, sleep great, more energy, more social, barely anymore cravings. Even if I do have cravings I have the ability to turn it down. My life feels like it’s back. I still have some down days but even those days are great. Stick to it and you’ll reap the benefits. My advice is to try to integrate quitting as part of your lifestyle. Try to forget about it, even when it seems like it’s on the forefront of your mind. Don’t associate yourself as being a stoner that’s trying to quit. You’ve already quit, you’re no longer a stoner and this is no longer you’re life. All you have is the present. You got this!",50

“Will I be the same again”
“Have I ruined myself”
“Is this withdrawal me or real me”

And all of this stems from the fear of drugs changing your forever. Ripping away what you once were and replacing it with a desolate shell of your former self.

I’ve seen first hand what drugs do to people, 2 aunts and a uncle.  All changed for the worse, 

I remember being told “It’s cause they took them pills, they’re never gonna be the same again” and the person who told me that is correct in more than way. My aunts and uncle are shells of their former selves.  

I guess witnessing first hand what drugs can do to people has elevated my fear or that happening to me.

I grew up in a environment where its normalized to smoke starting at age 13. I held out until 17, and even now I feel like I’ve ruined something, but then again it could be the fear manifesting. I’ve been sober for 20 days and when I tell people in real life they laugh.

I want to thank everyone for the posts I’ve read through in the last hour, I discovered this page in the middle of night after not being able to sleep. I’m 21 years old and began smoking late in high school. I was a kid full of energy and no desire to drink/smoke at all. I have always been a highly motivated person with the potential to do something with the creative gifts and personality I have. A social butterfly is how my family and friends would have described me, and maybe still would, regardless of my disagreement now. College came along and I had already discovered I loved the feeling of euphoria I got when smoking. It was a release from the perfect image I felt like I had to put up on a daily basis. 

Slowly, the relationship I had with weed began to change. I was able to own weed for the first time. I would take edibles before some of my college classes and waste the whole class sketching or writing monologues of how ridiculous school was. I was able to reason to my friends that weed had a positive impact on my creative output which I was why I would do it. It slowly but surely became a reclusive thing for me to do. I would have an incredibly productive day but the moment I could get a few hours of my own time, I would smoke. I have smoked every possible way in the last few years, with each passing year needing more weed just to feel something. I have driven hundreds of miles for weed and haven’t gone more than a day without it since 2019. COVID really had a detrimental effect with my usage with how little I was able to spend time with friends. My motivation suffered and things felt meaningless. I started to become okay with having meaningless days. I stopped chasing relationships and don’t have anyone in my life that makes my heart race. I relate to how weed makes you okay with doing nothing. I used to have an urgent desire to make the most with my time. Recently, I use smoking as an internal excuse as to why I don’t do more with my time. 

I’m almost 22 now and I’m at a complete crossroads with my life. I landed a great job fortunately and I begin in 7 months. It terrifies me to start in July and be at the same mental space I’m at right now. I just feel numb to life, completely going through the motions but never fully satisfied. Not satisfied enough to sit there with my thoughts without needing weed to block out the worries of my future. And the mistakes of my past. People may read this and think I’m overreacting due to my age. It just scares to me to think I could be in this spot 10-20 years from now and look back with regret. I want to be happy with myself and feel proud that I can feel happiness in the great times again. I’m starting today and just got rid of all my supply. I’m willing to make a change!",7

I had a major wake up call when I decided to bring my pen with me to the US just to get caught by a random check up. Was let off with 500$ and a record instead of 5000$ because apparently I was honest with them.

Tbh like most others on here I used it for back pain/depression/anxiety/adhd, but I just recently realized how bad it’s gotten. I wasn’t able to confront the reality of my situation of life and so I used weed as an escape, ultimately just making me pretty much pausing life, the only thing increasing being my age. 

Nevertheless, I’m going to be staying in the States for a while (approx 3 weeks), and I figured this is the best opportunity to quit cold turkey. Day 1, I woke up in the middle of the night with cold sweats, no vivid dreams, and absolutely exhausted. I laid in bed for the most part, just watching YouTube, severely unmotivated and lethargic. The next day there were no cold sweats, but guilt kindly knocked on my door (“kindly”may or may not be an understatement). I lied to parents about my graduation date (it’s actually 2 semesters after what I told them), I have no money because I wasn’t able to regulate my sleeping schedule, and dropped 2 courses, pushing the grad date even further back. My room back where I live is a mess, I rarely took showers, brushed my teeth once a week and ate one meal a day. 

I just recently turned 25, and thinking about the amount of work I have to do due to my inaction all these years is really adding on to my stress. 

As day 3 ends, I feel like I can wholly and fully quit for good, but this “looking back” and guilt is really hitting me hard, and I don’t really know how to deal with it. So, if anyone has any advice in terms with making peace with oneself/recovery and re-admission into life, I would greatly appreciate it.

My wife is on medical, and her whole family as well as all of our friends smoke, and only one person out of all of them only one has even attempted to convince me to go back. We're not on such great terms now, for that and other reasons. I've seen quite a few people say that they're bored and feel like they don't want to hang around their usual crowd for fear of temptation. I'd just like to point out that it's never too late to try and make new acquaintances! You don't even really have to try. Believe it or not, non-stoners actually seem to be more outgoing, and can actually be some pretty interesting people! You more than likely have a little extra money you'd usually buy a bag with - why not try to find a bowling alley, pool hall, somewhere where people gather for a common activity? I've found that even if you're not attempting it, conversations just sort of seem to happen. If someone sees you playing alone, they're liable to invite you to play with them. May not happen your first night out, but I'm willing to bet it will happen nonetheless! Of course, if you also have an aversion to alcohol, you may be best searching up somewhere people gather to play card/board games. While a little nerdy sometimes, these folks are usually super nice and always willing to invite you to play, assuming there's room for another person at the table. Plus, it's amazing how time flies while you're actually doing something! 

Keep up the good work, y'all! We're all on a journey of self-enrichment. It's so inspiring to see others going through the same things I have and do experience. As someone who's always had an aversion to people and severe social anxiety, I'm amazed at just how naturally conversations happen now that I'm not stoned and distracted constantly. If I can do it, anyone can!",3

There’s a glimmer of the person I used to be and I want to be that guy again. I’m finally in control. People tell me I seem different, that I’m more present. A friend told me last night that I seem more comfortable in my own skin. I’m having an increase in small talk amongst my coworkers and it feels good to be creating positive connections. I’ve always been on the skinny side but now I’m eating healthier. I have also started to workout a little. For the first time in years I don’t hate my reflection. I’ve been catching myself admiring the guy I see in the mirror. I hope this doesn’t seem like bragging or anything I just wanted to put this out into the void. Quitting has been one of the best choices I have made. My roommate leaves their weed stuff on the table and I don’t even glance at it. I’ve been down that path, I know where it goes. I’m going to make up for all the time I’ve lost wasting away smoking all day. I’m making new friends and my confidence is slowly returning.

I have questions for those of you who have been sober at least 100+ days and beyond… if you were able to, how long did it take for you to stop having cravings? Did you ever truly get rid of your occasional craving earlier in your journey or to this day? Did you replace old habits with new ones in your journey so far, and did you believe that had a significant impact on your problems with weed? 

I’m over 100 days sober and I have been having insane cravings lately. I’m getting very emotional about the whole thing. Like I’ll think about getting high and start crying. I’ve been very stressed out recently. finals, going to job interviews in my new field, being in between jobs atm. I know I’m feeling bad. being home all the time is boring too. I’m getting cabin fever. So I know all this boredom and negative feelings are adding to the want to escape…

The problem is I really love playing video games, especially after taking an edible or two.

I know that’s not healthy and I know those gaming friends aren’t going anywhere in life but that doesn’t make me want to stop any less. Honestly the only reason I don’t do it more is because my SO gets concerned with my habits and I feel guilty when I’m monopolizing the time and TV just gaming.

The last few days I hadn't been coughing up much tar/ash, but I had the first few days.

I did okay, i was in therapy, i coped. When I was 17, my sister got me a dab pen for Christmas. She was a responsible smoker and probably thought I would be the same. However, I discovered immediately that when I felt depressed I could easily get high and then instead of being sad I’d just be…. numb. Ever since then, when I feel depressed, I have this compulsive desire to smoke weed. When I can’t smoke I feel intense despair, like I’m going to die without it. Currently I am at home for winter break and I’ve been sober for about 5 days. It’s pretty easy here because I don’t have weed around me. I told myself I’d use this time like rehab and continue to stay quit when I returned to school and my apartment. The problem is… I don’t want to. My brain is already coming up with excuses of why I can go back to smoking. I’ve wanted to quit ever since I got started. It holds me back in life. I usually stay sober during the day to get my work done, but all I want to do in my free time is get high. I don’t pursue my hobbies, I don’t excercise, I don’t cook, I don’t want to talk to people or socialize. Sober me gets bored and decides to spend time with friends, do art, volunteer, make a decent meal for once. High me has an out.. I can’t do those things, I’m too high. I want to achieve my full potential. I want to make use of the gifts I’ve been given in this life. But ever since I was introduced to this crutch I can’t let it go.

Now onto the pornography","2021 will be the first year out of 16 years that (I'm 33) I have not smoked or consumed cannabis more days than I have not. I think I've only used once since August but I am no longer counting. It hasn’t been easy to get here. I  started consciously making an effort over the past 2-3 years. Espescially over the past year. Moving forward I may have a puff on a friends joint very infrequently but I can’t buy and have it around the house like I could alcohol. I’ll just fall into daily use and it will cloud my mind and potential. Not too many friends here smoke so that has definitely helped, you definitely need those people in your life.

I believe spending time with the internet and discovering sexually stimulating imagery fairly young also led me to self-sooth with pornography and masturbation prior to weed, hampering anxiety issues. The combination of weed and pornography was an overload for my brain over the years.  I’m finding it more difficult to cease pornography use, I’ve attached my sexuality so strongly to it. When discomfort arises in my mind and body I turn to pornography to fulfil it. Not being stoned definitely helps reduce the usage so it's another quitting benefit for everyone out there in the process of giving up.

I hope others are also becoming more fulfilled in life whilst working on their underlying issues so as to free themselves from cannabis and other addictions. I'm in the midst of starting neurofeedback to assist in this regard and the first session was very promising.

I made some (what I thought were) really good friends until even they started distancing themselves from me.

I got in trouble with Johnny Law twice, and the second time I was really making an effort to look at who I was. I started making changes to who I was and cut off those friends for some time to better find myself. I even made the decision to go back to school. Once I was out from under the eyes of the law, old habits crept back in and eventually started using semi-regularly. Once weed became legal in my state, it was game over. It's been 3-4 years of regular use again and I'm feeling lost in who I am again.

Luckily I have a therapist to talk to about these feelings and know the steps I need to take, but damn if this depressive state I'm in is making it hard to actually put the plan into motion.

It has definitely given me the ability to repair certain traumas, I like the weed high and it's social components, and I embodied & embraced being a stoner. All in all, up until now I would say weed has been a positive influence on my life.

However, I am not able to get good quality products anymore due to my location. The high I've been getting from these flowers can be described as ""hazy"", ""sluggish"" and ""numbing"". I'm not sure what it would be like if I'd still have access to my fav strain in a cartridge, but I digress. I decided to stop because I've seen enough addiction (alcohol) in my family to realize when you lose control. I noticed I lost control, and luckily I was able to admit to myself; I am addicted to weed. I kept covering up this hunch with ""but it helps to get me out of my head when I'm feeling down"" and ""it makes me productive when I don't want to"". Both of these statements - turns out - are the exact excuses that addiction uses to control our minds. I *could not* go a day without smoking weed, even if it was just a small amount. I think the combination of these two things have been the catalyst of the change.

I decided to quit cold turkey, at least for the time being. Reading this subreddit has been immensely helpful and supportive in this decision, especially seeing that I am not alone in my journey. Pretty much all the withdrawal symptoms are present right now, some more welcomed than others. For example, I have noticed a while back that I haven't been dreaming for a long time. The past three days I have had clear and intense dreams again, which I am *very* happy about. I do get waves of anxiety when I'm around people but much less and much different than what I used to get while high. My sugar addiction (munchies) has mostly diminished as well, again a very much welcomed change.

It feels like I'm back on reality's plane again. Today, walking on the street, I noticed I was simply aware of everything going on around me. The people, the traffic, and myself. There was no more haze, anxiety and thought-rabbit-holes that I used to get oh so often. I'm able to mind my own business without worrying who is looking at me and what they might be thinking. I'm able to focus on tasks a lot better because...I'm sober. I have a lot calmer and self-aware view of the future, and a lot more conviction that I am able to achieve the goals I'm setting for myself. And last but not least, I am not panicking how I will get high when visiting family, due to not being able to take weed with me on a flight.

When I feel the craving to smoke, I tend to call or visit a friend right away. This has been the most effective way to get my mind off of the thought.

I am in no way against weed, nor will I ever be. I think this plant is still magical and can provide huge benfits to those who can utilize it. But now I'm also aware how addicitve it can be, which I've never fully grasped before.

Thank you all for being there for each other and for me.

Edit: Funnily enough, what I really needed to hear for this realization was my therapist saying ""just stop"", which turned to be my first day of sobriety. It sounded ridiculous at the time, thank you captain obvious, but it was that indeed obvious truth I needed to hear.",22

I’m not a regular Reddit user but I believe the community here is more helpful and empathetic than any other.

Ive been smoking about 8 years now. 
Regularly I’d say about 6 years. I started off with hash and then moved on to regularly smoking weed once I got to college. It’s been a hopeless ride ever since. I never fully admitted how harmful it was for me. I always believed in reduction rather than completely quitting. I believed that I need this due to my personality and the way i react to thing so it’ll help numb my mind a little.  
Ever since I started the thought of quitting, I always thought okay I’ll just reduce it to before sleep. I managed to do that some times but it always backfired Back in to earlier the day. 

The only time I actually quit was when I was taking care of my pregnant sister for three months. It was due to lack of access. But now I have access, also my closest friends smoke. They would never force me. Actually I’m the one who got them in to it I think. But anyhow, I can’t seem to let it go. There’s also issue in my life that once I start trying to quit weed start messing with my mind. I get anxious and depressed . Now I know these are withdrawals but I need to know the best way to quit. I can’t open up to my family and discuss a healthy way to quit. I’ve always hid my smoking habits. Sometimes I wish I could talk to them about it. Maybe it would make quitting easier. But Kher that’s not an option. 

Can someone help me out?

I also have three businesses to run so I can’t change my environment.",2
2021-12-18 07:49:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rj6un2/day_12_this_time_feels_different/,Day 12: this time feels different,"Closing in on two weeks and although it's still a rollercoaster from time to time, I finally feel like I can do this. It sounds cliché, but acknowledging that I have a problem was a key starting point. I thought i knew I had a problem, but I now know I never really felt that way. Or at least wanted to admit it to myself. Up untill two weeks ago. Now I feel that this has been a problem for over 7 years and these past two years things escalated quickly (added binge drinking and other stuff in the mix..) It probably was a blessing in disguise. I dug a hole so deep I nearly struck a water pipe and drowned myself. If that makes sense haha. 

Anyway, aknowledging I have a problem, wanting to change and believing that change is possible were the most important steps for me to kick this habit (no i'm not in 12 steps btw). I'm slowly establishing a routine, I mostly eat healthy and try to be physically active. There's still a long way to go, but already I see so many positives after two weeks. I was focused at work, did a lot of socializing and overal took care of myself and my responsibilities.

One of the hardest things is the regret from wasting so much time, money and opportunities. But I'm starting to realize that dwelling on that isn't going to help me. Addiction is a form of self hate I believe, which is something I need to keep working on.

A while a go someone posted a comment on this sub saying: ""you know what happens if you keep smoking weed? Nothing."" I still think about that a lot. This sub is such a wonderful place, you guys and girls are absolute ledgends! We can do this! It might take more time than you want to, but the fact that you are reading this sub means that deep down you want to change. And damn right we can change. Not just for ourselfs, but for everyone around you.

Keep on keeping on everyone. And be kind to yourself. Life is short, way too short to be apathic and watch the world role on by without participating. We can do this!!",21

I write this because I want to share my **Personel** experience but also because I need to declutter my own mind.

I started smoking hash when I was 15 and became a heavy smoker when I was around 17, and now im 24. The time in-between is a black hole and there is so many things that I can't remember. I tried so many things to quit and always looked for the ""magic pill"". I went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD and it went well, but lockdown came and I started to smoke again. There is no magic pill for addiction. We can look for it now and forever to the ends of the world with no success.  
The magic pill lies in ourself.

It happened 2 months again when I got a total breakdown, I just could not keep up with this shit anymore. Meeting with a pusher, the risk of getting caught by the police, the shame I felt when ppl passed by me in the park where I smoked every single day. The money I go to work for wasted on weed and soda. The amount of time a wasted on picking up the weed, rolling it, smoking it, and then laying and being high being in a illusion/ fantasy world in my head where I would imagine the perfect life until I had to go to sleep. And the cycle would repeat itself the day after.  
I was like a dog chasing its own tail never able to catch it.

Because of the smoke you separate the mind from the body, and you disconnect from yourself and society. Not being able to control yourself and feel yourself. I mean like REALLY FEEL YOURSELF. I was smoking to numb my emotions cause I felt I wasn't in control.

I chose to call a body therapist, cause I have so many emotions stored in me after all these years of smoking. After the 1 appointment I had my first day clean.  
Was it alone because of him? I don't think necessarily. I think it was a combination of me getting the breakdown and wanting to find another solution for it. I tried so many times to quit I now exactly what to do but just couldn't follow through on it.  
But asking/getting help from a body therapist was just what I needed, cause when I felt the emotions store up and wanted to explode where I usually with light up a joint, he helped me release those emotions and I went home and slept without thinking about the hash.

After 2 months am I back to normal? NO!  
But im feeling much better than ever. I steel have brain fog, I still have days where I can't control my emotions. Im on the ADHD meds, but that's also not a cure for all life problems.  
Quitting weed didn't fix my life in any way. Except it gave me the power to be able to fix them. Im not a dog chasing its own tail anymore, but chasing life. And life can be tough sometimes but with darkness with can't have light.

Do I get cravings? No - personally I don't ever I miss the high but don't get cravings to smoke.  
Healing takes time and it could be months or years, but the fact that I started healing is everything to me. It takes so damn long to come back to homeostasis its insane and I don't want to start all over again. But being able to feel my body and emotions, dreaming and having so much extra time is a blessing I had totally forgot. Even on the bad days im still grateful cause I know that right now im having a bad day and fighting trough it without the hash but with my own strength.

Regarding the high, I've been doing Wim Hof Method. Its a way for me to feel calm without substance. And for me its help when Im emotionel or can't focus on my school. Personally I do minimum 5 rounds. I read some only do 3-4 rounds but the effects first start to kick in after 4 rounds for me personally. Sometimes I do 7 rounds and it just feels amazing. Being able to connect to your body again in a different way and feeling complete stilness afterwards. I also do cold showers in the morning and could only hold 5-10 sec in the beginning and doing 90 sec now every time which completely wakes me up.

I feel cleaner, healthier, able to do the mundane task like brushing my teeth at night, drinking lots of water, eating properly, reading books. Its not perfect, but it is a lot better than before. I still have trouble enjoying a movie og playing videogames. I still have issues reading for a long period of time. But its getting better. its maybe slow but its better. Im healing and I need to take my time not rushing ahead.

I work at a school and I really can’t smoke at work. It’s complete madness but it got so out of control that I couldn’t handle it and I smoked ”casually”. 

It sucks because I really love this job and it’s important to me. But I guess the weed got so out of control that I’m risking everything in my life right now just to feel slightly high for a short while on a lunch break.

My girlfriend (who also is a colleague of mine) noticed and took me to the side and kind of freaked out (which is completely understandable).

Long story short, she was done with me but in a miraculous way she still gave me one more chance. 

Only now, if I fuck it up again, she won’t be by my side anymore and also she would let everyone at work know and i’m going to lose everything that matters to me and everything I care about.

It’s really some kind of unexplainable force of energy that still gave me this luck that I don’t feel that I deserve.

But I know it’s really bad now and I really want to kick this addiction.

This is officially day 2 of not smoking. I live in a big student city and weed is everywhere, which is what has made it so hard to quit so many times over the years. I don’t even know how many times I tried to quit, way too many. I’m hoping I’m doing things right this time. 

I’m a student and go to my parents’ every holiday and am now home for Xmas. I never smoke when I’m here, so almost every time I’ve gone home in the last 2 years I tried to detox for a few weeks at home, and hope I continue my streak when I go back to uni. Clearly this method has failed me way too many times. The last time I went back to uni, in September, however, I decided I wanted to do things differently. I caved in and smoked immediately the day I got back, but this time, I reached out for help. 

There’s an organisation in my city that helps young people with substance problems, and I started seeing a support worker every week. I decided to start with a reduction approach, so for the last 3 months I’ve been trying to limit myself to only smoke in the evenings, trying to keep it at 2 joints max. I’ve not always stuck to it but for the most part I did. However, I was meant to be monitoring my intake and slowly reducing the amount week by week, which I found impossible as I always crave a smoke in the evenings.

My lack of progress really weighed me down and in the week before I left to go home, I consumed way more weed than I otherwise would have, thinking “whatever I’m going home soon fuck it”. I spoke with my support worker and we agreed we need to change approach as reduction isn’t working. I’m using the holidays to detox and I’m going straight into support groups and meet-ups in the community centre when I go back, something I haven’t done before and I think will make a difference. 

A sense of community is very important when quitting, not only for accountability, but also to feel less alone, which is why I really love this sub! I will be updating whoever might read this, and hoping to keep this as a record of my motivations and thoughts on quitting. 

Stay strong everyone ✌🏼",3

I just want to do it. I'm upset at myself for being back here, but I am.","FYI I have not yet smoked.  But...

***

For starters this year has been the most sober I've been in 10 years.  So props to me.  In general, most of the year has been spent completely sober.

What has been hard to find is the true desire to STAY sober.  I found it a few months back when, while having extreme migraines, I begged my bro to smoke me up to fight the pain.  We had an argument and the whole thing ended up being a negative experience.

So negative, that for some magical reason, I no longer associated getting high as the good thing I normally associated it as.  I was blown away how ZERO desire to smoke took over me.  

***

Until my one friend who I hadn't seen in 7 years wanted to chill.  I knew he would want to smoke and I would just not be doing it while he would literally be lighting up offering me a puff.  I basically didn't want to even hang out because of this, but ended up hanging out (and smoking) regardless.

I had a great time and now I feel that equilibrium, a month later, is gone.  I have the desire to smoke again and I'm kicking myself for giving into peer pressure.  

***

Lately I've just been fantasizing about smoking.  I've been having good walks and moments of beauty that I just want to ""enhance"" with weed.  I've had a lot of physical issues and feel like I need something to take the edge off for my own health.  I've been thinking about getting a medicinal card for these reasons.   But I also know it fucks my lungs hard and I really like breathing.  It takes me so long to recover full lung capacity after smoking.  My lungs got tested and I'm fine so it is probably anxiety, but I cough up that black shit and just struggle to breathe here and there.  It gets better the longer I abstain from weed.

I'm feeling anger at myself and my friend for putting me back in this instability and hell of desire.  I wonder if I'll ever feel that magic feeling of true desire to not smoke ever again.  Because right now, it feels like forced sobriety and if there's one thing I learned, when you force something you end up doubling and tripling down in the other direction.  I almost feel like every day I'm forcing myself to be sober is going to be that much harder of a relapse because now I don't really *want* to be doing this.

***

***

But I know it's best to stay sober.  I just feel like this is essentially my last check-in before I dive back in again.  I know it is going to happen because every day (it's been about 30 since my last smoke, prior to that a few months, prior to that half a year) I just crave it so hard and I feel like I'm just going to want to make up for ""lost time"" when I finally do it.  Notice I'm saying ""when"" -- like I'm already a lost-cause.

If you have any ideas I'm probably too far gone but just wanted to try coming here because this place has helped me get sober in the first place.",20

2021-12-17 17:38:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/risqzg/controversy_stepping_down/,Controversy: stepping down,"A couple of weeks ago, i decided that i needed a longer break/quit. Went to the web and all the websites I read before quitting said I should throw everything out and quit cold turkey. I had done that 3-4 times before, and when I read all these articles saying ""quit cold turkey"" I was high and felt anxious about the process.

Instead, this time, I had my mind set on using less and less for a week. Once the week have passed, my goal was to quit.
Before quitting: I smoked every couple of ours and I took 3-5 bong rips everytime I went to the balcony to smoke, I tracked my smoking all the time, 0.8-1.5 g a day.

During quitting: from that moment of ""now I'm gonna quit"", I started reminding myself if why I'm quitting Everytime I went out to smoke. And with huge will-power I let the final and sweetest bong-rip be and just went in the house again. Also if i felt the need to smoke and could manage not to smoke, I didn't go to the balcony at all.
For a week I had to remind myself why I'm doing it. My lungs reminded me as well.
During that week, i had huge mood swings. I'd wake up in a terrible mood lashing out on my kid, my gf, my dogs, the world and myself ultimately.  But I kept focus. Focusing on why I'm quitting.
The last day (yesterday) I went out to the balcony a couple of times. Especially memorable was the one before I went to bed. I had rolled a joint and had my bong ready too. I fired up that J and took a couple of puffs. Caught, put it down and went back in. The joint is still there. 

Now writing this. 24+ hrs after I smoked. The bells rang earlier today and are ringing from time to time. The balcony is 2.3 meters away from where I'm sitting and the joint is just chilling there, calling me to come smoke it up. Yet I feel the power in my hands.

Some side effects are inevitable. Like loss of sleep (i haven't slept good in a while even with weed) so not much worseå. Cold sweats during the day, I soaked a wool shirt while I was feeling cold, it definitely is less uncomfortable this time. And probably mood swings. But all in all waaaaaaay more manageable than when I had to quit cold turkey.

Stepping down over a period of time didn't work for me earlier, I think the main reason being that I had 30 day quitting period. But this time I took it down to a week and it's actually working pretty good.

I feel myself. My slow, regular, funny, depressed, angry, loving self.  Just like yesterday. Only without weed, not high.

I hope that this can give someone inspiration that one path is probably not for everyone. Everyone of us is different.
I knew, for instance, that quitting cold turkey would affect how I treated my son, which is the main motivation here. So I had to come up with a plan that minimized my bad behavior. Still, as I mentioned, I lashed at each family member, even the dogs at least once during the quitting period. But I know for fact that it would've been way more damaging for everyone if i just dropped it. So this worked this time and I'm super happy and proud of myself. Having a bunch of weed at home, have been addicted for 5-6 yrs and withing a week, I could go 24 hrs without hitting it once. On Monday, I'm going out of the country to visit some family and won't have any access to weed.


Tl;Dr: stepping down can be an alternative to some people, it just needs a bit more planning, dedication and will-power. Hope this helps any of you 🙏🏽",7

I spent about 6 years smoking weed daily and it took me about 2 years of trying to quit before I actually did it. It feels AMAZING! I am so much more clear headed. 

I originally said I would reevaluate after a year whether I wanted to smoke again but I will not be any time soon. I don’t really have cravings anymore but I do think about it sometimes and wish I could smoke occasionally. I know how easily I would slip back into daily though so it ain’t happening. Maybe in another year or two I’ll consider it again. 

Goals for this next year is to drink less. That was the one con to quitting smoking is I did start drinking a little more. Nothing crazy, but definitely something I want to address before it becomes that way! 

Anybody who is struggling just know that YOU CAN DO IT! It is not easy and different things work for different people so try new ways to get through those first few months which really are the hardest. I read this sub a lot at the beginning.

Cons: Cost (but you go camping or on a cheap cruise), no support network (except here), sometimes hard to find pot-free destinations (forget the Caribbean beach).

I started smoking weed at 18 trying to connect with a boyfriend who also smoked. I absolutely refused all drugs, cigarettes, drinking, etc up until that point because I grew up with heavy cigarette smoking parents.

Flash forward 10 years, off and on I've had the willpower to stop smoking when I found out I was pregnant for each of my 3 kids, but would still smoke the moment I got a green light when nobody else was dependent on my body anymore. My current partner smokes a lot of weed, and always have, and has recently turned to dabs since he has a really cheap avenue of obtaining it versus actual flower.

Over the last month or so, I have been smoking dabs or concentrates with him, but it started giving me horrible uncontrollable coughing fits, wheezing, and deteriorating me to the point where I've felt like I was suffocating in my sleep from lack of oxygen.

I assumed it was COVID, given recent events, but at the doctor's I was told I have significant damage to my lungs and developed asthma as a result. I tried smoking regular weed one time since the diagnosis and it was miserable. Absolutely cannot do it anymore. My bf is aware that now I cannot continue smoking, but there's no options for edibles/topicals around here. So now, the obvious next step is to just accept after a full 10 years of indulging in marijuana in my 20s it's finally caught up with me.

Now, I can't even listen to music without feeling unattached. I've started drinking because of the boredom and compulsion to do ""something"" (I don't even like drinking!) but it's only making me sick, irritable, and even worse than when I would just smoke.

My anxiety is through the roof, having mood swings and irritability over the smallest things, and not to mention the pain I feel in my neck and from my TMJ is skyrocketing.

It's been close to a full week without any marijuana, and I've forced myself into sobriety on my own accord several times before, for extensive periods of time, but it just sucks knowing there's really no incentive beyond MY OWN health instead of my children's or a job depending on it. Just need a little reaffirmation that this NEEDS to happen, and it will be much better moving forward.

Never smoked a cigarette, my history with other substances is very limited and usually only done one time socially, and don't like drinking because it makes me sick and sleepy. That's also another big thing for me, there's usually a wave of exhaustion by 8pm, and just want to pass out to go to bed. Busying myself with chores all day keeps my mind off the sobriety, but I just wish there was a way to exist that doesn't involve dissociation, like I've attempted to do for the last 10 years for my crippling anxiety/CPTSD. I substituted real therapy, doctor visits, actual medication in lieu of getting high because it was cheaper than copays/premiums/prescriptions/etc in the long run.",5

I've been lurkin on here from time to time, i could relate to so many of the posts y'all have been sharing in here, really love to read along with ya, reminds me why we and i are doing and/or attempting this.

So i built a bit of a mixed love/hate relationship with weed over the years. I've been smoking ever since i was 16, and by the time i got 18 and was allowed to get into the shop i've been high nearly every day. I'm 27yo right now.

In periods my energy was higher i didn't run into actual problems, winter time or lower energy periods i've been struggeling with much more. I've seen mental issues, i think i'm not able to develop myself as good as i could if i weren't smoking.

I'm working, and when i get home i've been resorting fairly quickly to a rolled tobacco mix what some call spliff, what i call a joint. And i think that processing my day high every day has made things more complicated than it should. Situations i've had harder times with i would be thinking about all evening, very unstructured and i often could 't make up my mind about it at the end. Then back at work, my mind would again be running 150% about some of the things.

I've stopped for some months, 1.5 years ago, during that time i've made a lot of progress, together with some mindfullnes, meditation intrest at the time. something i'm still benefitting from today. 

Last weekend i've put the weed down again. and i'm pretty sure i can do without. Sleep has been a thing, vivid dreams, waking up when things aren't right while dreaming. Last few nights i've also had some trouble getting to sleep aswell.

I can do this. It was really nice putting some thoughts into text here, y'all keep leaved and stay strong. It's not all that easy to control yourself like this, may this be a step in the right direction!

2021-12-17 02:04:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ribna3/its_been_3_weeks_since_my_gf_and_i_quit_in_those/,It's been 3 weeks since my gf and I quit. In those 3 weeks my life has changed drastically.,"So, the first week went about how you'd expect. A lot of drinking and nicotine, but we knew we were overindulging so we took a 3 day hiatus from all substances to clear out. Week 2, the first bomb-shell hit:

My 7-year old niece (my sister's kid) has been throwing temper tantrums since my sister and her scumbag husband got divorced. At first it was no big deal, then it became a BIG deal. My niece started destroying property with ridiculous strength. She smashed a toilet lid into a glass shower divider and ripped a toilet seat out of its hinges with the bathroom door locked. The next night she ripped a clothes-hanging rod out of her closet and made a spear out of it. She cut my mom pretty bad before my sister could wrangle it away from her. She proceeded to break 3 wooden chairs, knocked down her dresser with glass knobs, and bit/scratched my sister to a frightening extent. So, my parents and my sister did the only logical thing and took her to a hospital which took her to a psych ward. 3 days later she was out and the tantrum/destruction resumed. My niece told my sister she ""tricked"" the doctors into letting her out. After threatening to hurt herself and everyone else, including her 5-year old brother, my family once again brought her to the hospital where she was sent back to the exact same psych ward, not before biting a resident and drastically raising my sister's insurance rates. That was 3 days ago. I made my sister some sushi and brought it over tonight where I discovered that my niece won't be out before christmas. They're putting her on 2 different prescriptions that will be considerably expensive. My sister's broken over it and now she really can't afford Christmas for her kids. I'm trying to help the best I can, but I've been unemployed for a month (trying to get my first SWE job) so financially there's not much I can do. I've been taking my 15-year old nephew in as much as possible because his POS stepdad keeps harassing him (he was kicked out for physical child abuse) and he doesn't feel safe at home. His birthday's coming up this weekend, so I'm gonna make him steak, and demi-glace, and take him to the new spiderman. But, I can tell he's so depressed that I can't do anything to really help him. It doesn't help that my mom is treating him like an 8 year old in all this. 

2nd bombshell: My gf found out that after 2 years of fighting cancer (and a stroke in the middle of it) her grandfather's cancer has returned yet again, this time on the top vertebrae of his spine. I have an enormous amount of respect for this man, he's like Mr. Feeney combined with George Carlin. He decided he's done fighting, since its inoperable and stage 3 already. She decided to go back home 3 days ago to spend a week with him, making dinner and rolling him around the neighborhood to see the sights.

3rd bombshell: Yesterday my gf found out that her other grandfather has been in the hospital for 3 months due to an infection caused by a x4 cardio bypass surgery. He's been estranged from my gf and her close family since 2009. Now he's using my gf as the messenger to the rest of her family, as she's the most sympathetic person in the family to him.

I'm trying to keep it together, but I know I'm losing it. Having my gf out of the house and all of this shit pile on all at once has been the most considerably morose experience of my life. I'm trying to take my SWE interviews in stride, but I know my existentialism is causing me to underperform. I want to smoke SO BADLY but I can't because if I do land one of these jobs, I know they're going to drug test since I live in the south. But, being alone with my sober thoughts is so god-damned painful that I keep drinking it away until I fall asleep (usually around 5-6AM).

No one needs to comment if they don't feel like it, I just really needed to type this out. I think I posted this at 2AM for it to not be a popular thread. But, if anybody's listening and wants to chat, please message me. I really can't do this. I'm not going to hurt myself because I know that would really put the last nail in the coffin for my family. But I want to sooooooo so so badly that I can't stop thinking about it. I can't afford to go into a psych ward again, and neither can my parents. I just need a fucking hug.

TL;DR: Basically the moment me and my gf stopped smoking, the most earth-shattering shit happened in our lives. And we really really need to stop smoking.",7

I'd maybe be sober about 2-3 hours a fucking day. I can feel that my brain has turned to mush, and I can't even properly write the sentences in this post properly. Thinking back on how the hell my life turned to this, I know I had been trying to escape from this hellbound of a reality since I was very young, my methods just evolved to weed as an adult. 

I also don't know if it's just me who experiences this with weed, but the utmost negative effect I had was that it decreased my window of tolerance for things that did not give me immediate pleasure. I already had a problem with impulsiveness & lack of perseverance due to my ADHD, but I can now physically feel  the reward pathway in my brain just dead. 

I'm an undergrad student, and this has gotten so bad that I am not doing classwork, taking care of my apartment, working out, or even calling my parents at home because all of these things give me immediate pain and reward much later. I had heard from somewhere that you can train your body and brain to tolerate immediate pain and delayed reward by exposing your body to pain, such as cold, physical exercise etc. Anything else that helps? I am sure these skills will be very helpful in quitting weed as well. Thanks for the tips!",26
2021-12-17 00:08:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ri9pla/feel_like_im_being_dramatic/,Feel like I’m being dramatic,"I started smoking at nearly 18 and for 2 years I smoked a couple times a month max. I didn’t ever buy my own stuff, just smoked with friends and paid them my share (so I wasn’t a leech). In the very beginning of Oct, I bought a 1g dab cart. My plug is my friend and we discussed how long it would last me. I said I’d probably smoke 1-2 times a week and he said I was set for next couple months. 

I finished that cart in less than a month because I was smoking almost everyday. I went back to him in November. Bought two carts this time, thought I could control myself and make them last until March or so. I finished both in under 3 weeks, smoking every day. 

I know that’s not a lot and I feel a little embarrassed posting since most people seem to have been smoking and dealing with this for years and not just a couple months off dab carts. But I noticed so quickly how awful my life became smoking everyday. 

At first it was really fun, obviously. But then you get stuck in a cycle. I’d wake up around 12-2pm because I stayed up too late getting high the night before. At that point I’d already missed a couple classes for the day, so I’d stay in bed. Spend all day smoking, eating junk food, and watching netflix or Tiktok. Spend my evening hanging out with my roommates while pretending to be sober. Not make any meals because I was full from snacking all day. Not leave my apartment because I can’t drive high. 

I know I haven’t been smoking long at all, but it’s already what I think of constantly. It makes me lazy, numb, and unsocial. It enables my procrastination. I didn’t even study for my finals because I was too busy medicating my anxiety and stress with weed which would make me feel great, but even less productive so the initial anxiety would worsen. 

I’m back home with family instead of at my apartment, so I can’t smoke for the next few weeks. I think I might have to stop for the foreseeable future though, because moderation seems impossible already and these are still early days.",9
2021-12-16 23:50:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ri9dxd/436am_on_day_4/,4:36am on day 4,"So me and my husband have been pretty much daily smokers since we met 2 and a half years ago. Before that I smoked most days for ten years and they smoked semi regular but not to my level. In the pandemic we have stepped up our usage so much and tell ourselves that we can take breaks every now and then but they're few and far between.

We managed 45 days back in February. I hate that we decided to get some after that. It's tricky because my husband has chronic pain issues and they're almost not noticeable when we're stoned for months at a time but reality checks in real quick when we decide to quit and they suddenly remember that without weed their body is in a constant state of pain and discomfort.

We managed 33 days back in June before deciding to ""treat"" ourselves to a spliff. We have this timed box we can put the weed in at night to ensure we don't waste the next day stoned and it will only open at say 8pm when we're done and ready to unwind. Problem is we'd just unscrew the lock if we wanted a smoke.

One or two attempts at 4 days here and 10 days there but nothing substantial. The problem is its never intended to be forever so starting again feels inevitable. It's always ""well obviously we'll pick up for when we go camping"" or something so we never really feel like we're free of it even when we're clean.

Anyway so this time round we're serious. Not making big promises because it hurts to break them so often but we both feel good about this time. We've both been coughing so bad. Our house smells. We have repairs needed on the house that we can't afford if we're smoking. We have a nephew we'd love to see more of but we're often worried we smell of weed. I like to cook and go running and I do neither when I smoke. I just get high and watch YouTube. I don't even watch anything of substance like movies or great television dramas I'd love to see. I watch memes that probably also ruin my brain.

Anyway yeah. Day 4. It's the early stages where sleep seems impossible so I'm lying in the spare bed, dripping with withdrawal sweats at almost 5am and still unable to sleep because my brain and eyes are wide awake. I suspect we have another couple of days of this before sleep gets easier. Hoping we stay strong this time.

We don't want to smoke again. It's smelly and expensive and so bad for your lungs and your health and your motivation and your teeth and your breath. We want to be active, healthy, have disposable income to spend on fun stuff, lasting stuff. We want to be free of this bullshit. Free of the headaches. Free of the night twitching (anyone else get that? My limbs spasm randomly at night when I'm high and I hate it so much).

I don't have a point to make, just not sleepy yet, saw this sub on my homepage and decided to stop ignoring it out of guilt. I'm here saying I'm an addict and I'm doing something about it and if this post helps me feel that little bit more accountable to achieve something then it will be a success.

Love and support to everyone reading this who knows what I mean and everyone going through the same struggle x",12
2021-12-16 23:38:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ri96om/decided_to_take_a_break/,Decided to take a break.,"I originally started smoking 12 years ago.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was put on pills to cope. My doc upped my dosage until I was taking 8 times my original prescription. I felt numb all the time, I was no longer a participant in life, but an observer.  After months of this I decided I didn't want to live that way, but I didn't want to suffer either. I regularly though about ending my life and searched for relief. 

I found that relief in marijuana, and began what would become smoking daily. During certain periods I was high all the time, at home, at work, always. At some point I decided I needed to make more of my life and cut back my smoking to just before bed. This worked well for me, I went to trade school and became an electrician. I have my red seal and I'm a journeyman. While I was doing my last block, I suffered a serious back injury and my neurosurgeon informed me that I should go back to school and get a career where I would be able to use my brain instead of my back. 

I'm now in my last year of school for electrical engineering. I have a 4.0 GPA and am top of my class. Still throughout this time I continued to smoke daily. My mental health during the last several years has been fantastic. I'm in a long term relationship and everything is on the up and up. I'm no longer as physically capable as I once was and experience pain regularly even though I've mostly recovered from my injury.

I'm currently in exam week of a very stressful semester and my use have definitely upticked in the last few weeks to cope I suppose. I have two weeks off before I start my last workterm with the company I decided I wanted to work for when I started engineering. 

I decided to take a short tolerance break before my holidays so I could enjoy them, and be a degenerate to some degree and live the freedom before buckling down in the new year again. 

I stopped smoking Friday past. 

I'm more miserable than I have been in a long time. 

I can't sleep, my anxiety has peaked and I can feel the symptoms of depression seeping in again. I'm paranoid and cry regularly about scenarios I've made up in my head that aren't real. This has made focusing on studying for my finals beyond difficult. 

I want to smoke again to get some relief from what I've been going through the last few days but I feel like if I do I'm letting myself down. I'm failing to control my emotions.

Mind you, I don't crave the marijuana. I just don't want to feel shitty anymore. I have my vape pen sitting on my desk but I haven't really been tempted to use it. I haven't touched it at all since. 

I can't tell if my symptoms are from marijuana withdrawal or if my old mental illness issues are creeping back in after being held at bay for so long. 

Am I weak if I start smoking again? 

It's never really negatively effected my life. I always seem to accomplish what I set out to, whether I have a dependency or not I'm it sure. 

I just really felt the need to get this off my chest. 

I've read many posts here recently and I feel as if I'm not really in the same boat as some others here, no judgement mind you. I had my time being high all day every day but I haven't been that in 7 or so years. 

I'd love to hear from anyone who has a similar experience  with advice or support or whatever else. Feel free to dm me or reply here. I'm just so tired and I have exam 5/6 in the morning. I don't need much to pass but I need a 70 to keep my 4.0, which is very important to me.

I smoke daily up to 10 joints, before covid I used to smoke only at the end of my day, but now I do even when I wake up, to « start » the day. 
I’m lucky that I managed to finish college this year and get a full time job. I managed to quit 4 month ago for 3 weeks, I felt so much more energetic. I miss that feeling.

I’m two days weed free after what feels like a lifetime of contemplation to make this decision - it’s mainly for my partner, who is essentially driven crazy by my weed usage. I started smoking at 18, 7 years ago, when I first moved to Seattle and lived away from home. I’ve had an intimate relationship with weed ever since, always smoking or taking edibles in the evening but often times also during the day. I know how much weed has impacted my academic performance, cognition, financial well being, and memory. It’s always been so normalized around me and I’ve always felt like (for the most part) it’s okay to have a nightly indulgence, especially because I work so hard. 
What has really been (besides my relationship issues) motivating me to quit as of recently, though, is my mental health, or lack thereof. I have a lengthy history of OCD (pure o, ruminations, intrusive thoughts) and subsequent depression and anxiety. As of the last few months I have grown increasingly unstable and depressed. I do have to wonder the impacts of weed in regards to mental health- I guess I am basically looking for affirmation in that weed does harm those are compromised in regards to mental health to help me stay off. Does anyone have personal testaments or resources?
There are a lot of reasons to quit but I think this might be the one that keeps me there.

For some context i’m 23 and was an all day baked out of my mind smoker for 3 years starting my freshman year of college even when it made my life hell and I was broke and homeless and caused 2 psychotic episodes and an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization making me withdraw from school. There were some times I’d have 2-4 months of sobriety, usually due to my circumstances preventing me from smoking, but i’d always relapse. I hated it, but I just felt resigned to it as something I wasn’t strong enough to overcome.

Finally some clouds parted and I got my life on track. Got housing and financial stability, and improved my relationship with my family which helped endlessly. My partner and I quit together around our 21st birthdays. I can’t tell you how great I felt. I had my life back. It was my life again and I was myself again. My agoraphobia and extreme social anxiety slowly relaxed over the next half year. My mood stabilized and my psychotic symptoms completely went away. I did so much better in school than I ever had and even though there were still hard moments, everything was significantly easier. My sobriety really felt different, I was still tempted of course, but it was that full realization of knowing I could absolutely go back to smoking, but everything would be the same as before that kept me going. With this strength and resolve I was able to turn down things like my roommates handing me burning pipes multiple times and friends’ offers. I finally felt like I had a choice. I maintained this for almost exactly a year and a half.

A year after quitting, my partner graduated and moved to another city to do a year long program. I still had a year left until graduation, so we planned to move back in together the next year. We knew the distance would suck, but the first 2 years of our relationship were long distance so we knew we could handle it and it’d be over quickly. So I had to find a new apartment. Got a great place and was incredibly lucky to find such a cool and kind roommate. I have to say that he is the best roommate I’ve ever had, while just being a great person. He and all his friends worked with disabled children, an all around nice person. He invited me along on their hikes. Everything was great. By this point (1.5 years sober) weed felt like a part of my past. It was still a distant temptation, but I had things in my life I enjoyed and brought me happiness, like my family, my partner, school, and my hobbies.

I had mentioned in my post looking for a roommate that I didn’t smoke or drink but didn’t care if my roommate did. My roommate asked me again to confirm this and I told him it really was no problem and I used to be a total stoner but didn’t smoke now. One evening I came back from work or school and he was sitting at our table. We chatted and I headed off to my room, he asked you wanna smoke some weed? In that moment I thought of all the times I turned down my old roommates, I thought of my partner, my family. I said uhhh and hesitated for moments that felt like forever. I honestly think him being such a good person and us getting along so well contributed to me giving in. I wanted to bond with him over this. I think I reasoned to myself that whatever, it’s just a one off, I’m strong enough to just let loose this one time. This is not how addiction works lol. I think many of us are here because we aren’t those people who can be every now and then smokers. If we were, it wouldn’t be such a problem. I said hell yeah and we smoked. Of course I made a fool out of myself since I was out of my mind and body high lol. As the next days and weeks went by I lied to myself that it really was a one time thing and that I wasn’t thinking about getting high 24/7 wishing he would offer again. So when he did I eagerly took him up. This happened a couple more times I think. Obviously I could have turned this around. Nothing was forcing me to relapse, but by this point mentally I was done for. I found a dealer but they only sold halves and ounces. I bought a half, further fucking myself and cementing my future. Yeah I had some good times in the coming months, but what I lost was absolutely not worth it. I told my partner about it and he expressed how worried he was and urged me to be safe, I knew he was disappointed. I have BPD and bipolar, and as I mentioned, psychotic symptoms. I got involved with shitty people, being high removing those inhibitions for me. Up until this point, my partner and I were in constant contact and were on the phone every evening/night but now we stopped since I was out with shitty people and always high or asleep. By the start of the winter semester I was fully relapsed. School fell by the wayside. I was once again in that cloud of not caring. Nothing could touch me.

TW Suicide Attempt

By the end of the semester my mental health was in shambles. My roommate moved out mid March so I was living alone. I had started experiencing psychotic symptoms again, agoraphobia returned as well as crippling anxiety. These caused me to lose an amazing dream research position. Suddenly, my dealer stopped selling. I had to quit cold. (Obv yes I could have found another dealer) My anxiety caused me to miss a psych appointment to refill my prescription medication for depression and anxiety, so I had to go through withdrawal for those and weed at the same time. All of this through my finals and my birthday was just too much. In a daze I attempted to kill myself, but thinking of my family, partner, and cats (lol) realized even if things were god awful in my life, I still wanted to be alive for it. I was thankful I was able to stop the bleeding. By sheer luck and the skin of my ass, I managed to still graduate. My parents visited me. I was starting to feel better. My job was set to continue through the summer. Had some stress finding a new apartment, but generally things were looking up and I was so excited for the future and to restart my sobriety.

After an uneventful summer, my partner finished his program and got a job back in our city. Had some more stress finding another apartment together, but finally we were able to move back in together. Things were perfect... except I was extremely stressed about my own future. I had a good amount of savings to carry me for the next few months but needed to find a job. I wanted something in my field since I’ve always wanted to go to grad school. That creeping temptation became so strong again. For some reason cold weather and winter always makes me want to relapse even more. It culminated with me desperately smoking the resin in my pipe and pathetically scrounging for crumbs. I thought every day about finding a dealer. A few weeks later, I gave in. I found someone and bought an ounce. I was so excited. I smoked. Yes my body felt that release and relaxation, but mentally I was fully aware of what I’d done. All I could do was feel like shit and think “Really? Nothing’s changed? Will you ever learn?” I can’t believe I am back to this. Sneaking around to get high. Spending money I don’t have. I haven’t told my partner yet. We’ve spoken about weed recently. I expressed my amazement at how seemingly easy it is for him, 2.5 years sober now. I am thinking about it all the time and he is just never tempted. Goes to show how real addiction is. I will tell him because I don’t want to hide things from him, but for now I just don’t want to bring him down with me. He’s doing so well and his life is so together. This will have to be my struggle. 

So I know how this plays out. I throw away the good I have in my life and dig myself deeper for this stupid drug. I just hope the next time I quit is for good. I know I have a lot of work to do mentally if I ever want to get to that point. If you’re sober, please take this as a reminder to stay strong and that it’s never worth throwing away your hard work. If you’re relapsing right now too or have yet to quit just know you’re not alone and I believe in us. We’re stronger than this. You all inspire me :)


TLDR Was sober for 1.5 years after 3+ years of daily use. Started smoking again when my roommate offered due to weakness and stress about the future. Smoked for 5 months, forced to quit, sober for 7 months, just relapsed 2 days ago. Not worth it at all. Nothing’s changed, right back where I started.",3

Last four days have been super weird for me. My mood was up and down, emotional, I was depressed sitting around doing nothing.  Yesterday I had a really good day felt good, happy like myself. Which gave me hope.

 This morning has just been blah..for me. Luckily I haven't felt too depressed to a point I can't or want to do anything. I'm still doing stuff I just feel bumed out. I just want to feel how I was feeling yesterday. Which was happy, motivated like my old self.  I feel my emotions are baselining where I haven't been super happy today or super low. I'd feel blah then low then blah. Nothing too high or too low. 

Basically...a heavy user for 7years, and I've decided to stop. I'm on day 4.  Day three was amazing I felt happy and good and today is blah little bit of anxiousness it comes and goes. I just wanna know how long is this going to last? Any help or suggestions

2021-12-16 18:57:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ri3sac/one_day_in/,One day in,"It's been a day and 18 hours since I last smoked and the depression is getting worse. I've never had it this bad before. As a man, I usually hold back tears but I broke down in the privacy of my car last night and today I've been feeling on the edge of another breakdown. I was part of a Facebook community that supports people trying to quit just like this forum, but Facebook's algorithms banned my account for 30 days today because of some comment I made on a different group. Facebook friends is all the friends I have and they took them from me for 30 days when I need them most. I literally have no friends to hang out with in my hometown and I'm feeling extremely lonely and depressed especially without weed. I have my brother and a dog and that's it. I'm 37 and I might be going through a mid life crisis. I feel my mental and physical health deteriorating. I'm gonna subscribe to a gym membership tomorrow and will be going every day. I'm also getting some running shoes and will begin jogging this weekend. I'm desperate. I NEEED to stop feeling this way ASAP! 😞",2
2021-12-16 17:38:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ri279z/hello_some_tips_and_tricks_i21f_have_found_while/,hello! some tips and tricks I(21F) have found while getting sober!!!,"hey everyone! so just a little caveat: I’m a university student, and mostly got high for the fun and escapism. with this in mind, I don’t know if every tip will be helpful for every person, but I figure it’s always better to have more information about quitting out there <33 I’ve been sober from weed since early november (and I’ll get into why I don’t count exact days soon!) 

1. I think it might go without saying, but I have quit many, many times. 

I’ve tried to quit cold turkey about four times before this one finally stuck, so I kinda ended up weening myself off. the first major time I quit, I got to three weeks. I detoxed a whole lot and then thought “hey, I’ve gone long enough, I deserve a hit!” unfortunately, that hit felt very good and I relapsed. it’s for that exact reason I don’t count days anymore, it doesn’t feel like i’m counting down to a future day I can get high again. tl;dr: as long as you don’t stop quitting, it’ll stick one of those times. 

2. relapses happen, but don’t turn that into a mantra! 

relapses are often an inevitable part of getting sober. if getting sober was easy and fun, we’d all have done it ages ago. be gentle on yourself when they happen. however, you also have to be firm with yourself; knowing relapses happen shouldn’t be an excuse to go get high, which was a tough one for me to push through. 

3. spend time in bed

this might be a weird one, but hear me out! of course, hobbies, exercise, friendship and all the stuff that rounds out one’s life are super important parts of sobriety. but, you’re probably not gonna feel like doing them, especially during the acute withdrawal phase. I am here to give you permission to lie in bed while the shitty feelings and cravings pass. I personally like to watch asmr (and often end up napping) but you can also listen to music,
watch a video, or just chill. again, kind of a weird tip but I’ve learned not to underestimate the power of lying in bed as response to any bad feelings. plus, your body probably needs to make up a lot of REM sleep, so a nap always helps there! slowly, you’ll build up the energy to go for a walk or see a loved one. but, at least at first, the point of getting sober is to just stay sober. so lie in bed! it’s warm there. 

4. rid yourself of temptation

this one is probably gonna be a “down the road” goal for a lot of you, and that’s okay! I live in canada, where notably, weed is legal. but, when I went home for my last reading week, I didn’t bring any weed along with me and I noticed that it really helped me stay sober; I didn’t have to fight myself on not smoking because there was no cannabis to do it with. I relapses from that week, but I ended up just getting rid of every vape and edible I had later on. the other day, I made it halfway to a dispensary before I went back home, because I’ve gotten to a point where I genuinely prefer my life sober and don’t want to risk relapse. this brings me to my final point!

5. sobriety is both not cool and very cool and it’s okay to struggle with this dichotomy! 

this is probably the least fun point, but possible also the most important. if you’re here, you’ve probably realized that for the time being, your relationship with weed is not healthy. if you’re like me, getting high was very fun and a much needed escape. if you’re like me even more, you’re often pretty bummed that some people can just — use substances responsibly. it’s okay to mourn the fun you’ve had with any substance. it’s okay to mourn the fact that your preferred substance(s) may never be a thing you dance with again, or at least not for a long while. be sad about that, there’s sadness there. but, what I wish for every single one of you (and what I’m slowly building for myself) is a life filled with sober richness and fun! it can be done, it’s hard work, but the fact you’re here means you’ve already done the problem admitting and I’m so, so proud of you!!!!! I hope these tips can help you guys, I’ve been so inspired by so many of your stories that I thought it time to share my own ^^

***BONUS TIP*** may I present to you all your new favourite method of escapism: dreaming! since THC limits REM sleep and dreams, learning to improve your dreams can be a really fun goal that helps sustain sobriety! I’ve been trying to promote lucid dreaming (since I’ve always been quite an intense dreamer) but keeping a dream journal can help promote dream recall as well! a totally safe and healthy way to escape into your mind and process, and hey, any excuse to get more sleep, right? ;))",8

let me first say that these 18 days are the first 18days that ive gone without weed since i was 17, i am 27 now. I’ve been a heavy smoker for 10 years, smoking on avg a gram a day. 

the first two weeks were surprisingly bearable. i replaced weed with yoga in the mornings, and was establishing a morning routine for the first time in my life. i was met with night sweats, but slept well, no decrease in appetite, if anything there has been a weird increase.
for the past 4 days, my appetite has surged, im having trouble sleeping through the night, im exhausted most the day, my weed cravings are intense and i meet them with food, drinking, or doomscrolling. i find my experience to be different b/c, for the first two weeks i felt for the most part good! even happy at times. the past few days i feel pretty fuckin depressed, my morning routine has fell off b/c i have a hard time doing anything. i feel extremely bored and yet extremely unmotivated to do anything. i am committed to not smoking, so my willpower is staying strong but my existence feels entirely bleak.  at this point, i should be turning a corner and instead i feel like im sinking slowly. id like to add that im in school and work for a total of 60 hours a week, so im limited on what i can fit in as far as exercise-but i do bike to work and school. any advice/support is appreciated. much love.",0
2021-12-16 16:36:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ri0vnj/extremely_sweaty_hands_and_feet/,Extremely sweaty hands and feet,"I will try to be as concise as possible, so please bear with me. There are some details of my situation that I feel are worth mentioning so I can get solid feedback from you guys.

 Let me begin by saying how amazing this community is, its community's like this one that remind me why Reddit can be a cool place and not a cesspool of weirdness... lol.

I have been a habitual smoker for about 6 years now. Recently I went through some detrimental personal issues and my smoking ramped up significantly in a short period of time. I was high all day, every day.   
I got sick of it, and decided that I would sober up and gain control of several aspects of my life again (sleep schedule, diet, focus & attention span). In the 6 years I've used,  I have sobered up 3 times, each time for the wrong reasons (doing it for other people, not myself). The insomnia and night sweats have been consistent with each time I quit, so when these appeared 2ish days into my sobriety , I was prepared.

However, this time is a bit different. One of the main reasons I wanted to quit was I started experiencing extreme amounts of palm and foot sweating. This would only go away when I smoked, and in my mind it was my body fiending for another hit.   
Wake up, sweaty palms, hit the bong, wait 2 hours, sweaty palms, hit the bong, rinse and repeat. I had assumed I built a major dependence on the THC. 

I am currently 9 days in to this journey. My hands and feet sweat all day, every day. I have not gotten an ounce of relief to this day. I am beginning to be able to sleep soundly which is amazing, but the extreme night sweats prevent me from sleeping for long. Now for the 'twist' in my story...

I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis about 3 years ago. The condition carries a lot of brutal symptoms that can come and go randomly , and typically guys my age (24M) experience an onslaught of new symptoms for the first 4/5 years after diagnosis as the disease takes shape in the body. Dismal, I know. One of these symptoms is a raised body temperature (auto immune disease, basically always on the verge of a fever). I'm hopeful this extreme sweating is strictly related to the withdrawal of THC, but I have a feeling it is more related to my condition at this point as I've gotten absolutely zero relief from this symptom for the  past week. Its seriously affecting my ability to do things and I want to be as proactive as possible in getting on top of this. If its THC related, then waiting it out is my action plan, but if it's the UC, then I may have to begin taking additional medication on top of the beastly drugs I get injected every 6 weeks. Before I go to the hassle of attempting to get with my doctor (extremely busy and not very patient focused), I wanted to drop this in here and see if anyone else was in a similar situation or had any insight to offer me.

Background: I've smoked daily for about a decade. I've stopped for a few months here and there, but it always creeps back to daily. This time I have made up my mind that it will be the last time :) I have strong motivation. I have a strong support network, and I have access to a brilliant counselor if I need it. 

Why am I quitting: future lung health. I couldn't live with myself if I got lung disease from just using weed to calm my mind, to sleep better and to deal with boredom. Just isn't worth it. That, and I don't want to be dependent on anything like this for my general well-being. It's been fun, but I'm done.

How's it going: like the title suggests, I'm on day 9. Pretty proud to be here, but feeling like ass. The two biggest symptoms are insomnia (just a few hours of good sleep per night) and many coughing fits per day that leave me feeling like shit. Also experiencing waves of anxiety and depression, but honestly I'm doing ok (like a 5/10). I am running daily, and this helps a bit. However today after my run, I got home and spiralled straight into a panic attack. Felt like I couldn't breathe (even though I wasn't having trouble breathing) and was losing touch of reality. Pretty scary stuff! Almost lost my mind. Luckily it settled in about 20 minutes. 

Just wondering if other experience the same, and if so, approximately how long til it passes? I think the main trigger is lack of sleep .. but it's possible the intense run set it off too. Let me know your thoughts :)

I'm so excited to get back to normal!",3

Right before the pandemic, I lost my twin sister unexpectedly and started smoking more. Then, when my job went remote, things got even worse, and I was high all day long, and pretty much have been ever since. 
My house is a mess, I cancel plans, barely get by with missing work deadlines, and have ignored executing my sisters estate and my personal finances/taxes etc. I have finally grown *tired* of myself and my bullshit. I know quitting weed won’t solve all of my problems, but I also know that if I keep my ridiculous behavior up, I don’t have a shot at happiness or well-being, so quitting is my first step.

I don’t have cravings and don’t think about smoking, but I’m struggling with the insomnia and the steady flow of tears I can’t stop crying. I’m so emotional and tired. 


I just want to be reminded that this phase will pass.

A few months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD but the doctor won't prescribe for it without a drug test coming back below a certain limit (which I am over). So I have a month before another test to kick the habit from multiple times per day down enough at least to get this life changing medication (which I'm sure will help the addiction issue since I was using it to cope with my symptoms)

I've tried quitting several times in the past but never had a compelling  enough reason to go for more than a month. Now that I'm in my 30s i just don't want to be doing this every day, so I'm glad to find this sub and see your stories and inspiration.

I also just started a job which is painfully boring, and I hate losing all my free time. Getting high at the end of the day is a way to reward myself for getting through the work day. Combine that with the winter loss of light and general pandemic malaise, this is a hard time to part with my only vice.

I have felt very blessed in how mild and manageable my symptoms were in the first two weeks, after smoking every day for 15 years. 

There was work stress today, and at the end of it, it is obvious it is not my fault or mine to be stressed over. My routines of setting up peace in the mornings could not provide a buffer for the stress as I was woken up to the calls and texts and had to just go- 

I now see how valuable it is to set the day with good intentions, to enjoy coffee and peace and write out gratitude, to do a quick meditation and have a moment to myself. Without it I was boundary-less, and all of my works stress and the overreactions of my boss and coworkers took residence in my soul, causing every little inconvenience to piss me off beyond anything I’ve felt in a long time. 

But even though I did everything wrong today, and it feels like the day is a wash, and I still have so much to do, I have decided to come here, take 5 minutes to write it out , refocusing on my own peace. I will do what I can and let go of the rest.

I am quite certain that I won't give in to my urges of weed, but to be sure of it I need to vent a bit about today;

Today was going pretty well, I had class and after that I headed on over to my girlfriend. I was kind of anxious going there since I knew from the last time I quit that I would be a bit on edge, boring and not easy to entertain. Once I was there it didn't go great, nothing major but I bawled my eyes out over some issues and like I predicted, I felt like shit since I knew I'd made her day worse + not been that fun to be around. To make matters worse, I went home feeling like shit around dinnertime knowing that I'd have 'better' dinner over there and that food could help me, since I had not eaten anything yet. When I came home however there was nothing since the person who told me they'd cook for me forgot.

Normally I'd be able to take all of this in and just have a normal day, however today it just fucked me. Although I thought about it a bit on my way home, I won't be getting any weed since I know it'll just make feel worse after, however I am not ready at all to have these emotional difficulties every day, especially since weed made me worse at processing emotions.

Sorry for this long ass text, however if anyone has tips on how to deal with emotions during withdrawal I'd love to hear them as I think that'll be my biggest challenge; whenever I felt really bad I would just smoke until I wouldn't feel it.

I've tried it many times in the past, but never made it over a month or two.. this time, I managed to last 6 months. And it was relatively easy. The main reason I started smoking so regularly is because it really helped with my anxiety. It would distract my mind enough not to think about it, and the dreadful feeling would always be completely gone. I haven't felt real anxiety in years, so I thought it was over, which made quitting easier.

Then in November, my SO and I got a puppy. I work from home, so I'm with the puppy 24/7, which started killing me. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I didn't expect to get hit this hard - all of my anxiety was back, all of the old feeling and all focused on this dog. I was really considering giving the dog away, but I've wanted one forever, and my SO would probably hate me if I did it. I lasted a few weeks, feeling like shit every day, couldn't eat, sleep, do any work and I felt horrible about everything.  I was literally crying daily, and I constantly worried about the puppy. This is quite normal for new dog owners, and it's called ""puppy blues"".

One weekend, I met an old friend unexpectedly, and he offered me a smoke. I took a couple of hits, which actually made me more anxious at the time, but for different reasons, I still bought a few grams off of him, so I could try if it would help with the anxiety I was feeling. For a  few days, I felt a bit better, so I didn't even smoke the weed I got.. I was proud of myself and really thought I could get through this without it in the end, but I didn't want to toss it, because the thought of having it made me a bit calmer.

Then one day, I was feeling really anxious again, loaded my vape and fell back into the old pattern. At first, I was smoking it only in the evenings, but quickly started smoking it through the day. I'm still able to function normally.. I don't get super high, just enough to feel the release of tightness in my chest. It makes me forget all about my anxiety for a while, but it does come back every day. It makes it much easier to get rid of it though.

Anyway, I've ran out of weed today.. and I'm about to contact my plug, to get some more. I really don't see myself quitting until these feelings disappear.. I've heard from many people that it gets better with the puppy, which is when the blues supposedly disappear. I hope that's soon, and I hope I can forgive myself for being weak.",2

And passes the time. But now its actually killing my motivation and drive, I don't feel like doing anything but eating and watching TV all day, and video games. When I stop smoking, I question myself and ask myself wtf have I been doing this whole entire time, I should of been more productive. But then the cycle continues, I want to stop this cycle of smoking weed all day. When I stop smoking I feel like going out and doing something, and feel crushed because of all the time I wasted, and how I let a bunch of opportunities go because I was too lazy and high, I could of been doing something productive with my time, but I'm in my damn room getting high not thinking of any bright ideas or meeting new people. 

 When Im high I get so anti social, I have no clue why I still smoke. I'm 23 years old and I don't even have a job I quit 3 of my jobs in the past I chose comfort over hard work. I found the answer to stop smoking, and it's so obvious. A change in lifestyle and mindset! I got too comfortable with being high and lazy it's time to quit it's time to feel alive. The only reason why quitting is so uncomfortable is because we got too comfortable with being high, time to let it go.

Beginning of this year I stopped smoking weed for 2 months, which is a big accomplishment for me, since I smoke daily for 4 years or so now. I'm 26 now.

Sadly I relapsed in May, I found a job and things in life started to turn dark, so dark that it made me relapse, oh boy what a mistake that was.

So I'm writing this silly letter to weed, as if it is a toxic relationship, to end it once again. Maybe someone out there sits in the same boat and maybe it can help someone.

Dear Pete the Weed,

I'm breaking up with you, I'm done and I regret letting you into my life when I was sober. Those 2 months being clean from you was the best I have felt in ages. I stopped coughing, been doing sports again and eating good food.
Now I feel empty again, depressed and lost weight again because you make me nausseaus, you fog me up and keep me from doing the things I want to do. Work has been very tough and I hate my job, but you are not calming me down, you just fog me up and put me to sleep, just so I can suffer the same feelings and exhaustion the next day.
Now that I know I want to be sober again, I am letting you go. I want to enjoy the life again and deal with stress and struggles the right way. 
I want to breathe better and enjoy all the foods life has to offer, I want to paint and play games again instead of wasting my free time on you.
You are not for me, you do not help me, you make me hate myself and for that...

goodbye Pete.",32

Ive been struggling with cannabis addiction for a while now. I was two years sober then during the pandemic I fell back into old habits.

This year I switched careers to become a software developer and even though I like my job I also find it very hard. The sleepless nights almost make it impossible. 

I do also have some mental health issues (dysthemia), and that's why I got tempted to smoke as form of self medication. I am in therapy again to deal with that.

&#x200B;

If you are going to relapse, it will start with a negotiation. For me, it was telling myself 'I'll only smoke on super special occasions- at a cottage, on a camping trip etc.'. It will make perfect sense to you, and in your mind there will be no way your plan to use weed again can go wrong. Since, after all, you have mastered your problem!  What you forget when you are playing with the idea of using again is that you are an addict. And addicts can't use in moderation. Addicts also can't 'negotiate' with their addiction. Whatever negotiation you are making with weed will end unfavourably for you.

&#x200B;

Slowly (or quickly) the negotiation you made with yourself and weed will change. Once a month will change to 'only using if friends have it, I won't buy it', this will slowly change to 'Its okay if I buy every once and a while, as long as I don't keep a stash', this will change to 'its okay if I buy it and keep a stash as long as I don't use every single day'... until slowly you will wake up right where you left off however long ago. Thats what happened to me.

I want to share my lowest point of my relapse with you so you know how easily you can get back to weed having complete control over you.

My shift at work was almost over, but I wasn't going to finish my closing duties in time to make it to the weed store before it closed. I asked my manager if I could leave early from work so I could make it to the weed store before it closed. He gave me a hesitant yes, and I ran to my car. I sped to the weed store, honestly, I was not driving super safely. It was raining heavily, and I was so distracted counting down how many minutes I had left to get there that I wasn't highly alert and I was driving over the speed limit. I pull into the parking lot but I missed my chance, they had just closed. In my head I knew this was a sign to give it up for the night. But my addiction wouldn't let me. I got home, and began shaking out empty beer cans that my friends and I had used to throw roaches a few nights before. Warm beer spilled all over me. I shook each can until I had all of the soggy roaches lined up in front of me. I took each of them one by one and tried smoking them, burning my fingers in the process.

Then I hit gold, one of the dirty soggy roaches covered in warm beer had a tiny pinch of weed in it and I got a lung full of smoke. I exhaled and felt it kicking in. Oh no- but that wasn't enough. I was only a 'little bit' high, and I needed more. With all the weed stores being closed, I only had one option. I remembered my dad used to smoke weed when I was in high school. I began systematically going through every single possession he had in his office. I looked in every pocket of every coat, rummaged through every bag, I looked in every box, I lifted each piece of clothing individually out of his closet to see if I could find some weed. Let this pathetic moment sink in, me a 25 year old, snooping through my dads closet and possessions in complete desperation. Finally, I found some crumbs of ancient brown weed filled with hair and lint in the pocket of a pair of his jeans after rummaging through his room for over an hour. Of course I didn't have any rolling papers, so I drove (under the influence) to a gas station in my town to buy them.

&#x200B;

I hope this story can serve as a reminder to you of what weed does to you, and what type of power it holds over you. I had over a year clean. I was so strong. And I got back to this point in less than 6 months from when I decided to break my recovery for a 'one time thing'. The thing from this to take away is that your negotiation with weed will always fail, it will always have the upper hand. Don't start negotiating. Accept that you can NOT use in moderation, and you will not somehow magically be the exception to the rule, like I thought I was. My year and 3 months is thrown away, but I will not give up. Good luck everyone, I will not smoke with you today.",79
2021-12-15 23:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rhic1a/my_user_name_says_it_all/,My User Name Says It All,"I smoked 6-10 bowls a day of Grateful Dead-level weed for the last 11 years. 

Before that, I was abstinent about half the time, but always just marking time to get high again -I've visited Amsterdam 22 times. No one likes Anne Frank and pancakes that much. I never took a vacation where I couldn't get high. I lived a life where if the baggie felt full, I felt full. And as it emptied, I mourned it like a loss.

I stopped cold because my wife needed surgery in Mexico. It's hard enough to hail a cab here; looking for pot would be hopeless, even backing out the getting ripped off or getting hit on the head-factor. I smoked 5 bowls in rapid succession the night before the flight, behind the dumpster of a Holiday Inn Express. Reality got really flat and dissociative, like I used to like. That was 24 days ago. 

Over my long life, I have developed a keen eye -like a cockroach- for places I might sidle into and smoke. I am old enough to remember telephone booths, I'll bet I have smoked in a hundred of them. Today, walking around lushly green Mexico City, I mentally checked off a dozen surreptitious (ha!) smoking spots.

I have a lot of regrets and shame to process at the exact same time that I am overcome with relief and gratitude for my wife's good health. For the first time in 40 years, she is free of  bad chronic pain. She was a bowl every other day girl; it helped her with nausea. She will abstain in support of me. We'll join a gym as soon as she can walk and pursue other healthy living options. 

These 3 weeks of wandering around in this very supportive and delightful place have been all over the map. Week one was basically a rage enema. I took a lot of long walks on terrifyingly uneven Mexican pavement to keep it away from my wife. Week two was very low energy, which was OK since my wife was sleeping about 16 hours a day, post-op. Week 3 was a mix of up down, but about 2% better each day. Go a week like that and that's practically a letter grade of improvement. 

I feel lighter, less obsessive, less compelled towards shame. I am a life-long meditator and developed a mantra of ""Love self/Love (fill in my name)"". I wanted to give support and respect not just to my essence/soul (self), but also to that glorious mess of tics and ego that is what I front to the world (the my name part). 

When I feel shame or regret, I stop and thank the two me's. They did the best they could in my sad life, they took me so far, they just wanted a little pleasure and respite. 

And now they want to heal and be awake. I owe them so much. I'm grateful to see them come out of the other side, still on my side, still serving me. I want to help them get better. 

Spirit is strong. You reading this, so is your's.",86

 It's a long one. I wouldn't want to short change you into thinking it was easy or is going to be easy. 

Feel free to read my last post. I wrote it 4 months ago when I was 3 weeks into quitting for the third time this past year. It's a dismal post and displays exactly how exaggerated withdrawals can make a simple situation. I just got on here to give an update and decided to read it again myself.... 

I am doing SO much better that it is almost unexplainable. 

Today: 5 months of no weed straight, but around 10 months of the last year I spent sober. Before that, 9 years of smoking weed every single night and burning many full weekends away. 

I landed the job I am working today exactly two months after quitting this most recent time. This job is no joke. It's a high level construction management position where I am in control of millions of dollars worth of work. Although I am qualified for this position, I can positively say that I never would have landed this job, been able to handle this job, or even considered going through the steps that it took to get this job if I was still smoking. And the job ain't even the best part of quitting. 

During my first few recovery months it was a daunting task to even think about going back into my trade as an electrician despite having years of experience as an electrical superintendent. I was working a dead end, low stress, and low paying job despite being a skilled individual who had previously made good money. And that was doing good considering my lowest point. 

My lowest point was tumbling into 9 months of unemployment, self-loathing, and suicidal thoughts. During these months I was high all day every day, spent all my savings, and worked up a nice bit of debt. All while barely being able to get out of bed and being completely incapable of normal social interaction. There is no doubt that weed was the tool I used to push myself to the low. (I landed in this state multiple times on my weed journey)

To make matters worse, I juggled these thoughts on a weekly bases for years and was seemingly fine. I even had some success. That doesn't change the fact that I was constantly suppressing extreme anger, sadness, and depression. And every single time I would have a large trip up, weed would keep me in a depressed, incapacitated mindset. 

Currently, I am excelling in my new role. My moods are significantly better despite the fact that I am under an extreme amount of stress compared to when I was smoking or when I was first trying to recover. My ADHD is much better and getting better as time goes on. Time doesn't zip by anymore. The last 5 months have felt like at least a full year and the last year has felt like 2 or 3 years. My relationship with my family is getting better. It hasn't been all good, much of it has been extremely tough, but damn has it been nice to feel like time isn't just slipping away from me. I am eating better, accomplishing ten fold, saving money, and best of all

MY PASSION FOR LIFE IS SLOWLY COMING BACK. 

I don't spend all day angry and pissed off at the world just waiting to get home so that I can smoke and relax it all away. Those cravings and thoughts do still come, but they are becoming a tiny part of my life. 

Weed keeps you from ever realizing your potential. What you can do while abusing weed is miniscule to what you can accomplish sober. I am so glad I stopped and honestly quitting was hell. I was mostly functional while smoking and never got high while at work and I accomplished a lot so it was hard to leave. However, it was during the hard times that my weed use would destroy all my hard work and turn hard times into terrible times. All while making you think it's helping. It's sneaky and has taken years from my life. 

Here's to my weed free journey. The tough times definitely aren't over, but damn is it nice to be able to notice the good times again. To anyone struggling, especially in the beginning of your quitting journey: It gets better, and if I can do it, you damn sure can. You gotta fight for it though and you better expect it to be hard.

I thought I was in such a good spot back in February with this addiction, then I was hit with a wave of loneliness and all my hobbies lost their fun. I couldn't bring myself to use any of my coping skills and I just gave in. I was embarrassed for myself and all I felt was a shame, but after that first hit, I knew the hooks were in. I was so embarrassed, that I couldn't even bring up that I was using it again in my therapy appointments or to my friends, who I trust with my life. Very counterproductive I know... but here we are, damn near a year later. 

This year was amazing on paper. I met the love of my life, got a really nice job, and started competing in Smash Ultimate like I have wanted to do since the pandemic started. The sad thing is I can't remember any of the details. I can't remember the details of the first date of the girl I am in love with, I can't remember movies or tv shows I watched a few months back, important conversations about people's personal lives that I would have remembered sober, etc. I feel like what should have been the happiest, most mentally stable years of my life, was smoked away and I am very sad about it. What's the point of being happy if you can't remember it... ya know?

I feel like my brain has been running at 50% capacity ever since I turned 21, and I am just sick of the routine. I will want to get sober for one reason or another, then 3 months down the line, I lose sight of my motivation and give in to it. It's so damn easy to give in to it, but so damn hard to stay away. This was a fun thing that I used to do with friends, turned habit, turned obsession that has made my life an anxious mess.

I am good a getting sober but fuck do I suck at staying sober... this won't be easy but it is what I want and need to be happy and stable. This is Day 1 Take 3... wish me luck friends!",2

My depression got the best of me and I started balling on my way to work. I had quit about 4 days ago but then relapsed a bit because I found a joint in my cabinet while I was going through the withdrawal depression I go through when I try to quit. I was depressed as hell so I couldn't just throw out the joint. I disposed of it by smoking it. That was 18 hours ago. So today I started feeling the depression all over again because I reset the whole process and I'm feeling extremely guilty about it. I'm living with my older brother and I confessed to him what this quitting process is making me feel. During the confession I was trying so hard to hold back  tears. Then afterwards I went to work and on my way there, I broke down so bad. The number one withdrawal symptom that I can't stand is the depression and hopelessness I feel during the first couple of weeks. 

My brother doesn't smoke but he was supportive and he offered me to join him at the gym on Friday. He goes almost every day. Though I tried to hold back the breakdown, he could tell how this was making me feel. Today has been unbearable and I'm trying to make it through my night shift. I can't stand those first few days after I quit! It's an emotional nightmare every time. Weed only shows it's dark side when you try to quit. I know I'll be fine after 1 - 3 weeks but it feels like an eternity when dealing with depression. I lose my appetite and get irritable too. Luckily I can still sleep just fine, but my waking hours are a nightmare. I know we're in this together and I love everyone of you guys in this group. I love your encouragement and support. Let's keep helping each other out. 😞❤️",2

- The anxiety the first three weeks is real. You have to be kind to yourself and remind yourself you are worth it.

- The pain you endure and are dealing with is your body trying to correct itself. Instead of telling yourself you are “insert negative agenda” tell yourself this is your body healing.

- Once you pass a month, don’t tell yourself it’s gone and you are perfect again. The bad days come out of nowhere but they get easier to combat.

- Keep reading other peoples accounts here and hopefully you will be reminded how awesome you really are. Love yourself and lie to yourself if you need to whenever you are struggling. If your mind plays games on you wanting to smoke, you got to hit it with “I’m not putting that shit inside me. Look at the pain I am in trying to get better”.

- Get to the fifth week and notice your dreams and how vivid they are. I’ve had a few nightmares and man… the reality of what we are suppressing when smoking weed made me realize how much I don’t want it anymore.

- Weed is not going to make you feel any better no matter where you are in your journey. Your mind telling you to smoke one or take a hit is weakness exiting the body.

- Tell yourself this problem is for life and reassess later when you are in a better mental state and can do something better for yourself.

- I struggle with this one but whenever you feel down, go out and do something. Even if it’s shopping for food. Just put yourself in a process and find yourself fighting those feelings. The more you do it the better you feel.

- When you are at your worst, sleep it off if you can. I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve felt so messed up and a good sleep fixed that problem. Can’t sleep? Talk to a professional for some advice. 

There are no easy shortcuts to kicking this to the curb. In 24 years this is the third time I am quitting and this time it’s for good. The strength in people further than me has given me the tools to finally beat this once and for all.

Love yourself. Always. You are so worth it. Friends or no friends…. Your life is yours and you deserve to be behind the wheel. 

Much love and here is to 7 more.",270

I wanted to post this for a dual purpose, first to thank all of you amazing people, and then to share a bit about my journey for hope that someone else can relate and/or so I can perhaps receive some insight.

On myself briefly, I am a 27 year old man who had been smoking since 14, every day since about 16 with a few minor stops over the years. The last time I quit was for almost 9 months at 24 because I was playing a university sport, and I did not find that THC was serving me well at all (I remember withdrawals being hard, and the brain fog lifting like a feeling of new life). An injury brought me back to smoking/using every for the past 3 years. I also gave up drinking alcohol last year, and the THC use became even worse. 

 Lately, I lurked this sub for a long time based on a need to escape from a daily, all day and night routine of smoking joints, carts, and heavy oil use. I finally took the plunge 49 days ago, and really credit this community with their support and the motivation to quit again, this time hopefully for good. I do not know if I could have done it without you all, and from the bottom of my heart, **I thank you all** (even if you have only ever commented, I guarantee you it has helped me or someone else in some way).

I am now on day 49 and feel quite depressed, anxious, and hopeless at times. I find that,  though everything has gotten better overall (finally started to lose weight, finally have the energy to work out again, finally working again as I found two part-time gigs in my field while in a part-time master's program), I cannot shake the feeling that I am waiting for things to get better.

I  understand that everyone's journey is different, *but I have seen some posts, and had some great replies from comments that claim that the real ""coming out of the fog"" feelings do not happen until 2 or three months for some people; sometimes taking even longer*. I wanted to ask you all if this has been your experience? 

I do not have a desire to return to THC use, as I love the improvements that I have seen so far. However, I still feel quite down and wonder if any of you think that these things might get better with more time off of THC after such a long time of use?

Thank you in advance, much love <3",3

Not this time though! I just ignored that it was there and carried on with the conversation like it was nothing, towards the end of the night I just got up and left. 

I respect my homie for not lighting up in front of me though, I might have gotten weak in that scenario. Still I was strong enough to not ask to roll or smoke, or take a small nugget home just for myself.

The hardest part to me is the free time, and the emotions. I wasn’t aware of how much I was leaning on weed to get me through any sort of bad news, setback, or bullshit at work. I’m having to learn all over again how to confront things, not not go into a hole via weed to escape. I’m learning to remove stress by just taking care of shit right away, instead of doing the absolute bare minimum of everything at the last possible second.

My ambition is also back. I hate my job, and I’m not happy with my place in life. The only difference is now I have the motivation to do something about it. Even if results are small, it feels good to move forward.

The biggest difference though, is that I’m engaging with the world again. I used to be high and avoid any contact with people if possible. Everything I did, whether it be social plans or family plans, always used to seem like obstacles in the way of me smoking pot on my couch. Now I look forward to going out, seeing people, and engaging. I no longer make plans and then instantly dread every second leading up to them.

I have depression - my reading, lifestyle, and doctors advice centers around serotonin. This has served me well enough in day to day life (or so I thought). 

Recently I read article about an heavy-drink phenomenon I have noticed in myself. When I drink enough to have a serious hangover, I also feel great during the day (not counting the queazy/headache).
I'm much friendlier, motivated, and energised.

The article had a lot to say about dopamine in general, as well as alcohol induced dopamine hits and what comes after.

Took a squiz at a cannabis/dopamine article and something in my head clicked on.

It's like the way I feel in my lows, and the process of getting through it makes much more sense, and if I can make some sense of my head space, I can get through quitting, and staying clean.

I've just gotten fit for a 4 day hike through the desert, and I intend to keep up the momentum.

I have a month or two of shit, and I'll be back to myself! Justifying moderation or just outright caving is no longer an option.",3

I’ve been a smoker for years.  It’s been my only vice.  I took it up after a particularly huge loss in my life about 8 years ago.  I came to it late; in my late 20s.  As a kid who grew up in an anti-drug family in the 90s, I never had any interest until curiosity got the best of me.  Along with therapy, it helped me get out of the dumps from the previously mentioned trauma.  The first time I took a break from it years ago, I had no idea what I was experiencing since withdrawal isn’t something that’s really openly talked about.  Everyone always has the attitude of ‘it’s not addictive and I can quit any time,’ yet I never personally saw anyone ever quit or roll back their use in any way.  True, it’s not addictive, but there’s not a lot of honesty when it comes to a certain amount of dependance.  Subsequent tolerance breaks became a bit easier over the years after understanding what it was that my body and mind were experiencing.  After that month would pass, I’d slowly, over several months, get back to daily use despite feeling fine after the month breaks.

Last year, I doubled down on my use and it eventually became consistent throughout the day to cope with the pandemic.  Vaping multiple times a day became new for me.  I’d always been a nightly, at most, smoker with some occasional day sessions to ‘treat myself.’  This past year, a lot of friends fell on hardship and kind of drifted away, my wife lost her job and the industry I worked in for most of my life had collapsed and I decided to throw a massive pity party.  

That brings me to a week ago where I had enough of feeling constantly high (and, despite living in a legal state, wanting to get ‘clean’ for potential drug tests during my job search).  So I decided to take a tolerance break and see how that felt.  So far, it’s been the easiest one to date minus the crippling depression I’ve been feeling.  I keep telling myself that it’s fine, I’ll get through this and that it’s the time of year and the unique difficulties of the ongoing pandemic that’s exacerbating the issue, but it’s kicking my ass.  I’m sure that it’ll get better as the weeks go on, but I’m not feeling particularly strong at the moment despite falling asleep on my own without the use of over the counter sleep aids last night (huge win since I’ve been dependent on marijuana for sleep for years).  It wasn’t the best sleep, but I’ll take it.  Admittedly, I haven’t been occupying my days with distractions outside watching TV and scrolling through Reddit.  I’ve always read that exercise and busy work are the best things to do during a tolerance break so as not to dwell on the withdrawal effects.

I don’t ever want to feel this way again and I think I’m quitting for good this time since these tolerance breaks have only ever been exhausting and confusing and tend to thrust me into depression and anxiety.  I’m feeling tremendously lonely at the moment and overwhelmed but trying to remind myself that it’s only been a week since quitting cold turkey.  I’ve had some cravings but that’s only been when I’ve been struggling the hardest with the depressive feelings.  Looking forward to eventually getting through this.",3

Had a couple days where I was really depressed and couldn’t stop thinking about how tempting it’d be to just do it one last time and reset again but I know that’s impossible… Yesterday, I had the most terrible vivid nightmare. 

As happy and proud I am about hitting 11 weeks sober, I just wish weed didn’t have such a relaxing care-free effect on me in the past; but I also remember that if it weren’t so euphoric; then I’d never become so easily addicted to it either. 

I’m gonna be practicing a lot of meditation + journaling for the next month until I can manage my feelings about this because I’m not doing good. I’ve noticed that i will jump at the first chance to escape using a substance specifically in this case alcohol which makes me slightly tipsy but that’s it. I can’t get drunk anymore my dudes. I might’ve killed so many of my dopamine receptors since being a weed addict for 3 yrs... 

I’m not only being a highly addictive person but I’m now well aware that at any moment, once I’m back on that hamster wheel I’ll never be able to get off.

One thing I know for sure is that I never would’ve made it this far these past 3 years had it not been for this community. No matter how hard I tried or believed I in myself and the reasons why I wanted to go sober, I couldn’t. Something just wasn’t clicking. 

Rehabilitation needs community and like minded-people to share their struggles and reasons for going on despite how difficult it can get. 

Enough about me. I’m so proud of you no matter where you are in your journey because the very fact that you had the awareness, ability, and courage to take that first step in doing what’s best aligned for your Higher purpose, shows me that you finally decided to put yourself first before your addiction. No one is gonna come and save the day; and no it won’t happen automatically either. Getting over an addiction is so underestimated; it’s tough af but always remember YOU ARE TOUGHER. You got this!",6

In a few hours I'll be at 1 week. It's going mostly ok, main symptoms are a wild cough and insomnia. I'm here to rant about the cough and see how long it took people to clear up. 
History: smoked pretty much daily for the last decade. The last big break was a couple months in the spring. Since then I  ramped back up to 1-3 joints per day. Then I stopped a week ago. 
Symptom: My coughing is relentless. Sometimes I can feel it breaking, sometimes it's just a dry cough, but it can go on for so long that it really starts to hurt/burn. Even my muscles are sore from coughing lol. Haven't had any colouration in the phlegm, just clear and somewhat watery. Anyway, looking for some encouragement and an idea of when it'll subside. I am running every day (just 2-3km) and that seems to help. I also sit in my bathroom with a steamy shower running. Lots of hot water with lemon and honey. Anything else I should try?

A year ago my 7 year marriage (14 year relationship) was on the rocks, and I thought that quitting weed and getting control of my life again was the only way to save it. It didn't. The withdrawal gave me horrible mood swings and irritability and ended up being the straw the broke the camel's back. I couldn't just light up any longer and ignore the verbal abuse, the gaslighting, the anger from a partner that had checked out of our relationship long ago and didn't want to be tethered to me any longer. So she left. She broke up with me over email and was on Bumble the next day.

I went through all the stages of grief... mourning the life I'd built and the future I wouldn't have. There were so many times I wanted to just say fuck it and float back into the hazy comfort of my other love. Weed had always been there to take the anger away and assure me that everything was going to be OK. Now I had to figure out how to start untangling my life from my ex, how to share custody of our young daughter, how to face a very unwanted and uncertain future without falling apart and without my best coping mechanism. It fucking sucked. I broke down and cried on Zoom calls in front of my new coworkers. I was furious when my daughter told me about ""mommy's new boyfriend"". I was resentful as hell when I had to watch my bed being carried out of my apartment. But for all my other failings I didn't smoke weed. I binged this subreddit anytime I had a craving. I started therapy.... meditation... affirmations... journaling... other drugs... trying to win back my ex... getting blackout drunk... random hookups... sports... all the healthy and unhealthy things I could think of to try to get through it. But I stubbornly refused to go back to weed. Not going back to that awful cycle of using and rationalizing and regretting and being trapped with no way out was at times the only thing I could still feel proud of when my ego was battered and my spirits were low.  But goddamn was it hard.

Looking back, I've made a lot of progress. I have kept my life together and stayed on good terms with my ex, against all odds. I've figured out how to live alone half the time and take care of my daughter the other half. I've been a good dad and managed to shelter her from the worst parts of a hard break up. I've started to turn things around at my job with my extra brain power and increasing stability. I've just been able to bring myself to start dating again, and my confidence is improving. But when I'm home alone for a few days and feeling particularly self-loathing, and the fear of becoming a sad, lonely, old man starts to set in, I get stuck inside my head. I sit back and think about how much better I might feel if I just drifted back into that haze... even for a little while...just to make the time go by a bit faster and the memories of my ex a little more distant. Just to feel content and at peace with my life again... 

...And then I come back here for a dose of reality and read your stories and struggles. I remember that I was not at peace, I was not content. If I go back, then I'm not moving forward... and right now moving forward is all that is keeping me going.

If you made it this far, I hope you got something from this post and I want you to know that whatever you're going through you're not alone. Even if you don't ever post or comment... keep reading r/leaves and know that whatever your situation is, a weed addiction is one obstacle that you *can* remove from your life, and you will be all the better for it.

I see now it's more so a mind game then anything else. Other then having trouble sleeping and staying asleep along with some irritablity the cravings have been rather tame then in my past attempts. 

Having people to talk to and give me support has helped me immensely in this process so far. 

meditation has also been a huge factor so far, Whenever I get a craving or have thoughts about weed I immediately focus on my breath and try to be in the present moment to get outta my head, as I know if I keep down that train of thought I'll chip away at my commitment to quit.

Since then, I've experienced more or less the same symptoms as everyone else. Nausea, chest tightness, sweating, brain fog, etc. Oddly enough, I haven't felt anything I'd describe as a craving or urge, although I do think about weed occasionally, so that's nice I guess. Also odd, is that instead of insomnia, I feel more sleepy than I did when smoking. For example, I've wanted to go to bed for the past hour (it's 9pm where I am, when smoking I went to bed 11:30-12:30 pretty consistently on weeknights). Last night was similar.

Anyway, for me, the worst symptom has definitely been the nausea/stomach pain. Haven't puked outright yet, but have thrown up in my mouth a few times. Feels like a toned-down yet never-ending version of hangover nausea.

When I get hungover, my go-to food has always been chips and salsa. It's the only thing that doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna puke at the thought of.

What about you guys? Did you experience significant nausea when you quit smoking, and if so, were there any foods you ate that you felt ameliorated the nausea/stomach pains at all?",2

I can't hide behind my addictions, and I won't.

I want to sit with lonliness, and dance with frustration. I want to feel all the good emotions and the bad emotions too. I want to feel good about feeling bad and I will. The road gets easier people, just fake it until you make it.

I started smoking when I was 15, which turned into a daily habit when I was 16, and now I'm 26 and have been sober for around a month. I am currently in my last year towards an engineering degree, and the way I see it, this year is my last chance to make the big changes I feel I need in my life, because this is the last year of my life that is *explicitly* about growth, learning, and personal change. I've made it this far a few times before as an adult, but I always relapse because of the emotions - they come out of nowhere and bowl me over, and I start to become obsessive and anxious and full of misplaced energy, and I'm often full of elation and satisfaction one hour and full of misery and self-hatred the next, which all drives me back to weed for mental reprieve, and thus the cycle continues. I've been obsessing over my need and desire to quit using weed as an emotional crutch and self-soother for a few months now, and one of the things I realized before I jumped is that to be successful in finally moving past the habit, I would need to learn not how to ignore and move past my emotions, but to fully accept them, to internalize them, to allow them to consume me, and to manage them through personal emotional strength. I think I have to go through a period of feeling constant strong emotion as an adult so that I can contextualize future strong emotions. 

I don't really have a question, and I'm not soliciting (but am not closed to) advice, but I just wanted to vent a little bit. I've been filled with emotion - largely negative - for several weeks now, and I'm tired of dealing with it. I'm sick of feeling volatile, I'm completely over the pervasive feelings of emptiness and uncertainty, I miss being able to lose myself in my passions and enjoy my hobbies without self-criticism and guilt over how they should be ""better"" or more productive, and I really miss how easy it was to take 90% of it away by hitting a pen or smoking a bowl, where the remaining 10% festered in a controlled manner under the surface. I hate the feeling of endlessly spinning my mental gears, of being aware of myself devolving into obsessive thought patterns without being able to remove myself from them, and I'm disappointed that the insomnia of cold sweats and discomfort has been replaced with the insomnia of an overactive mind. I miss having a feeling of inherent entertainment from boring activities - road trips (sorry, but I've probably driven more miles in my life high than sober), shopping, pissing away my free time, and anything else that involves waiting around or sitting idly by. I hate that this all feels like a hypomanic episode without the fun or productivity. Another realization I had before quitting is that I would have to quit drinking as well, because I always switch from one to the other - I'll be honest, I gave up on this pursuit, but I no longer drink every night (I don't keep alcohol at home anymore), so I'll consider that a relative win. As a result, I also miss having *something* that I could always count on to forcefully change my mindset upon arriving home after a long day, and that now arriving home often means I'm just in another place, with the same thoughts. 

I'm glad that I have the social part of my mind back. I'm glad that I can keep up with any level of conversation again, that I'm not constantly searching for the right word anymore, and that I'm able to think quickly enough in the moment to be ""funny"" and topical. I'm glad that my relationship with food is back to normal, and that I'm not constantly craving sugar, and that I can eat on-demand without having smoked recently. I'm glad that my discipline to accomplish tasks is about back to where it was when I was smoking daily, where I couldn't apply myself to any extended task without being high. I'm glad that I care enough to keep my home and body up to some reasonable standard of cleanliness again. I'm not glad that all of these positives are overshadowed by the constant feeling of feelings, the constant thinking of thoughts, and the constant turmoil of existing in my own head without the relief of marijuana removing me from that space, even if the end result was not really seeing my life as my own. I accept that this is all part of the process, and that I'll eventually settle on some tolerable equilibrium. To a level I've never felt before as an adult, I am determined to learn how to cope with my emotions by myself, without the crutch of weed or any other substances... but it's really hard, all the time, and I'm tired. Thanks for reading.",12

I am able to hit the gym more frequently, smashing PB's, in which I never could have imagined.

There have been a few bumpy rides along the way, where I've strangely had cravings here and there, in the last few weeks especially - (I'm not sure whether that's due to the seasonal change here in London, or due to being around mates who partake in smoking pot), but overall, I've managed to pull through, and I'm so grateful for this. 

Good Luck to each and every one of you continuously battling through this; I commend you all, because it is not easy choice to make.

Was planning a two-week t-break before Christmas, but due to some possible CHS symptoms it's turned into a full stop. 

I've been smoking pretty much everyday, all day, for the past year. At first it didn't take a toll on me. I wasn't doing much, and it helped me focus on what needed to be done and relax about the pandemic (I'm a serious germaphobe and hypochondriac so that was much appreciated!). However, I started to notice if I didn't smoke I would have rather violent vomitting attacks. It got to the point where I was afraid to travel anywhere without weed on me. Obviously, that's not sustainable or healthy. 

Last Thursday, I experienced some extreme nausea and a total lack of appetite. This is something that I've been dealing with kind of on and off for the past year, but I finally stopped and realized it might be related to the weed. Of course, I still spent the day Friday smoking and hitting my new pen, and then I paid for it by getting even sicker. The entire weekend + Monday I could barely get off the couch.

Even though I'm counting Friday as my last day of smoking, I did ""wean"" off of it over the weekend by taking 1-2 hits a day. I thought those hits would help at least some of the nausea and anxiety I was facing from withdrawals, but it didn't really. So I just fully stopped today. And honestly, I'm already feeling a lot better. 

Been reading a lot of the posts here and in chsinfo and they're all super helpful, so figured it didn't hurt to share my story.  For anyone else out there who's going through this, I'm here with you! We can do it.",3

Feel sad and happy.,"I think I feel sad because over these 4 months I've really come to understand how much weed emotionally stunted me. I'm 26 and started smoking at 15. It turned to regular use around 20. I think weed helped me feel very content alone and now I feel like I missed out on maybe finding a partner or better friends.

I quit weed in 2020 for 6 months and then relapsed. I learned things each time. For starters, in 2020 I learned I had an addiction to weed. (I always did, just didn't see it that way). I faced a bunch of stuff I needed to about my childhood. 

Unfortunately though, I did relapse for about 8 months.

This time, 2021, I learned how much weed stunted me and how much time I lost because of it. And I do worry about relapsing, as much as I don't want to. Thank you to everyone on this sub. 

&#x200B;

I think I wrote this post for someone of the younger people, the teenagers. I've been seeing a lot of posts from them lately and I just wish I had known how much I'd regret my use in the future.

Anyways, that comes out to over 40% of the year being weed free. I never thought I could say that. Even with the slip ups and mistakes, I’ve made a lot of progress. 

Just a word of encouragement, if you slip up after quitting for a while, it’s okay. You’ll know what to expect physically and mentally after quitting again and the withdrawal process is a bit easier to handle. It’s not a walk in the park, but it’s helpful to know what’s coming next.

But today at work I've been able to retain some information on things, I've started helping within the office, taking calls, making notes, passing on information to staff.

My biggest issue is trying to find something to replace the time I spent smoking, which is usually till I go to bed at about 11-12.

Ive started walking the dog more often and further but even she is getting a bit tired of the long walks and I find I'm pulling a husky down the road. But I'm still going and trying to keep on top of it.

I've noticed my increase in smoking tobacco though when I'm at home, something to replace the weed but yet this isn't the better option of the 2. I rarely lit up a cigarette when I was at home, usually only smoked at work during breaks and the odd sneaky fag to split up the monotony of my day to day tasks. But trying to quit smoking weed and cigarettes at the same time would be too much and I know I'd relapse by the weekend if I did. 

So for now it remains to be that I just stay clear of the weed and focus on keeping myself clean. One thing I can say I'm proud of is a colleague at work who knows I smoke mentioned today he had some new bud in and it was one of my favourite strains. I quickly told him I quit and moved along before he could whip out his phone and show me pictures of the nugs. 

Also I've yet to delete my dealers number. Mainly because me deleting it isn't gonna stop him texting me about whatever 'stock' he has in. Yes my drug dealer runs his illegal business like a shop with opening times and special offers which I find hillarious.

Here's looking forward to day 3 and whatever difficulties it may bring.

I’ve been smoking since I’m sexually active. My first boyfriend put me on to both..

Always liked being intimate (in duo or solo) with weed on the bedside table. Solo happend mostly with some female-friendly porn. Because I couldn’t focus long enough to come to completion with fantasising in my mind alone. (Due to weed?! Idk)

Now that I stopped I don’t feel like doing the solothing or watching videos as much. Before quitting it was like every other day.
I’m single and I took a break from dating and sex for a while, cause the men I met were… not it. But that’s a whooooole other conversation. (If there’s a subreddit about celibacy that has nothing to do with religion but everything to do with selfcare, holla at me!) 

I think because of combining weed and sex for so long, my brain intertwined the two. And now, I don’t even know if my sexuality was real or weed induced.

After 8+ years of daily smoking I'm now on day 18 of my weed-free journey.

1. Skin looking MUCH healthier *(over the last year I noticed that the skin on my cheeks was starting to...well, it looked like I was aging. Pores becoming bigger and more visible than they ever had been before. After only 18 days off weed, that big-pore area is visibly shrinking and the skin on my face is becoming more clear and smooth.)*
2. Phlegm is changing, for the better *(I'm still coughing up stuff as my lungs clean themselves out, but it's less gunk each day. The texture is smoothing out. For a while my phlegm felt...harder? More solid? Almost pebble-y? But the consistency is changing back to smooth and liquidy.)*
3. Coughing less throughout the day, and when I do cough it's ""productive"" because I'm getting something up and out.
4. The quality of my voice and vocal tone has improved. *(My voice box feels less raspy and I've had a couple of people tell me that my voice actually sounds different, even people who didn't know that I quit.)*
5. I'm feeling less tension in my mid-section, which makes it easier to take full belly breaths and sit up straight. I'm hunching less than I used to.
6. Not waking up with dehydrated mouth and throat anymore.
7. My appetite has improved significantly, especially in the morning.
8. Even when I'm not *hungry*, I can still eat something. Eating is more bearable.
9. Easier to make choices about what to eat AND easier to carry out plans to prepare/cook it.
10. My executive dysfunction for small tasks has reduced significantly. *(I used to postpone a lot of small things that would lead to quality of life improvements. Like, if my feet were cold, I'd just ignore it. Now I actually get up and put on socks. Feels good.)*
11. Huge improvements in energy.
12. Huge improvements in motivation.
13. Enjoying listening to music more.
14. SO MUCH LESS ANXIETY!
15. Even when I don't feel great, I'm fretting about it less. *(Like when I am anxious, it's more ""ah, there's some anxiety. Let's try something to distract myself"" rather than ""omg what do I DO I can't bear this feeling guess I'll die"")*
16. Easier to make decisions I know are healthy for me (food, exercise, meditation, avoiding distractions, getting things done).
17. Feelings of laziness and listlessness have decreased.
18. I'm *looking forward* to things so much more! Actually feeling pleasurable feelings of anticipation for things that aren't addictive!
19. I'm slowly catching up on to-do list items that I've put off for ages.
20. I feel more optimistic.
21. Life feels more bearable. Struggles that used to make me feel helpless now feel milder and easier to handle.
22. Sleeping feels better than ever. Definitely having vivid dreams, but they're not disturbing me. Actually finding them quite interesting. It's crazy cinematic though!
23. Waking up and getting out of bed in the morning feels so much easier. Less morning grogginess and more mental clarity.
24. I have less patience for and less interest in doing certain time-wasting things that I used to be able to zone out with. A couple of times I tried playing a random game I didn't really care about 'cause I was bored and didn't know what to do...and after a few minutes I turned it off and did some work towards my personal goals instead. It felt good to make that choice.
25. My focus and concentration for thinking-related tasks has improved like CRAZY. My writing has gotten faster and more productive. I can plan and execute ideas more efficiently. I'm getting things done faster.
26. (Edit: remembered another one!) Heart palpitations have decreased and gotten less ""harsh""! *(I actually went to the doctor about this a few months ago and got tested with a halter monitor because I was so concerned that my heart was going THUNK. Got results back and doctors said I didn't have anything to be worried about, but the feeling of it still scared me. Now (I believe it's only happening when I drink caffeine, but I need more data to confirm) sometimes I do notice a little palpitation but it's more of a gentle* doot *than a chest-pounding THUD.)*

What are some of the surprising benefits you've noticed? I was expecting some of them -- but I did NOT expect my skin to clear up, and my appetite to improve as much as it did, and my voice to change, and for my overall feelings of wellbeing to be this good.",27

The semester is ending now and I can’t stop feeling this old familiar urge to buy some weed. I have been doing great, but I’ve been so stressed. I have got no current prospects on internships working out, and it seems like everyone I know smokes. 

I know I still want to be a better person and wanting to be better, in the past, would push the thought of smoking again out of my head; but, lately it seems like no matter what I’m not doing enough. Wanting to be better doesn’t sound as enticing.

Working with a therapist too. She calmed me down this weekend when I had an attack that almost put me in the ER again - wound up in the ER last week after a panic attack and migraine hit while I was out of the house. It knocked me to the floor. It's some of the worst pain and fear I have ever experienced. Being in the ER alone didn't help. It took them an hour to treat me, which felt like forever at the time. I was crying and begging anyone to help me.  
It's rough. Would love to hear experience in quitting the more concentrated cannabis forms. I definitely don't want to end up in the ER again.  
I also have a lot of other stuff going on - moving, quitting a job - so that is definitely making it worse. I don't want anyone wanting to quit to think they will be going through the same reaction as I am right now.",9

I want to respond here to all my thoughts that i have when the cravings kick in.
1. I’ll just go and smoke this time and that’s it. Moderation is key

-most common bs, you will either have the most intense cravings for another 3 days after u smoke or you will end up smoking daily again. How many times did u try moderation? Why are u still here than?

2. I feel depressed and unmotivated when I don’t smoke

-well weed caused all this, didn’t it? You felt like this when u smoked too, the feelings were just hidden in yourself. Life sucks sometimes, move on and make it better.

3. I can’t study enough and I will fail my exams

-you didn’t study a single hour when you were stoned all time, at least now you are trying

4. I miss my old friends
-oh, the ones that you liked just because all of them were smoking too but deep inside u knew they are a bunch of losers? Where are they now? Oh yeah, they left u because you don’t smoke no more. Nice friends man

5. I miss the old times when I was smoking

-LOL u can’t remember shit from the last 3 years that’s a straight up lie. And when you think about the times you smoke, don’t you find it funny that you remember just the good feeling of lightning one up but not the panick atacks, the self-guilt  or how boring it was to hang out with “your friends” and no one to say a word?

6. I feel like I am a shitty person when I don’t smoke

-Well maybe you are idk. But I know at least you are not a loser who does literally nothing all day. Maybe learn to control your emotions instead of suppressing them with weed?????

7. Life is boring without smoking 

-Than get your ass up and do something.

8. I feel a lot of anxiety thinking about the future
-than stop. Just think about today

9. I feel lonely

-well you replaced all of your real friends with a bunch of losers so you deserve it in a way…. But hey at least you have a gf who loves you so don’t lose her too(you will if you keep up smoking) and maybe reconnect with your real friends

10. I feel like I lost so much time, what are another few days?

Evertything man, everything. You say this because you are afraid to fail? And if you fail this time what? The important part is to get up and try to improve the streak next time.

Honestly I am so tired of you man, I swear I won’t give you power again. I really stoped giving a shit about your stupid ideas and feelings , you are just a liar who wants the easy way out. Well, I don’t want it no more. I want the hard way and I am not afraid no more. Sometimes self love means to be harsh to yourself in order to achieve your dreams and guess what? That’s the self love I want this time.",19

I was so anxious. As soon as I got high I wanted it to go away. I didn’t enjoy it at all and threw away the rest of the stash I had bought. It was money wasted yes, but I feel like the $20 was worth me realizing I never want to do this ( or any other intoxicant) again.

I really don’t know how I was able to smoke so much for years. It just really messed me up for hours. I’m surprised I was high for 4 hours and I didn’t even smoke much. It was the worst possible feeling.

I had been counting my 11 months of sobriety pretty closely and you could say I just ruined it last night. I’m disappointed in myself but surprisingly not too much. I feel like I don’t even need to be counting anymore. I know i don’t want to do this again for the rest of my life so what’s the point of keeping track.

I think the longer I spent away from weed the the more I forgot why I stoped in the first place. If I have any advice to people who are trying to stay clean it’s that your reason for previously quitting was big enough for you to stop an entire addiction and suffer through the withdrawals of it and just because it’s been a while and you want to try it again doesn’t make the reason you quit any less valid. I feel like your mind makes you think it wasn’t an important reason. For a long time I was trying to convince myself that I could start smoking again but just a couple times a month but yeah that’s not going to happen.",56

I could have seen the breakdown coming: all week I had been increasingly irritable, restless, and discontent. Instead of slowing down to deal with the sources of my discomfort, I tried to outrun it by upping my caffeine and cigarette intake. Of course, that did nothing but increase my discomfort and desire to escape.

Once I determined I would use, I debated between alcohol and weed. I ultimately chose weed for a few reasons: 1) My partner is an alcoholic in recovery and I want to support her sobriety 2) I am active in AA and did not want to tell everyone I drank again and 3) I see weed as more spiritual and less harmful than alcohol.

I bought a preroll and 100 mg of edibles and finished everything within an hour. The high was nothing like I remembered and romanticized; it did stop the thinking and body discomfort I had been experiencing, but was not pleasurable beyond that. After a couple hours I became foggy, uncoordinated, paranoid, ashamed, dissociated and just wanted to be out of the high. My partner arrived and I experienced her differently, along with experiencing myself differently, and felt an immense wave of sadness that lasted until I had cried it all out. We had pizza and ice cream and I ate every bit of it before sinking into the bed.

The rest of the weekend I felt very slowed down and a bit low. As I write this on Tuesday morning, I feel I am just returning to the familiar ""sober me"" experience of life. I much prefer this one. 

Using weed again was a helpful reminder as to why I prefer sobriety. It seems there is a much wider range of feelings and experiences available. I like that I am able to touch reality, and change it through  changing myself. I dropped the cigs and am on the long-offramp from caffeine.

As has been said, ""The ultimate experience is life itself.""",129

It was just so euphoric and I think if there’s one thing we can all agree on in this subreddit, it’s that as addicts everytime we get high, we always recall that first time and chase it again trying to attain that insanely euphoric “first time” high (if it was good idk ig).

over time I’d meddled into other hard drugs which were NOT good one bit for my developing brain but I eventually just realized I wanted to stick w weed as I concluded it was the least harmful. 

oh what a mistake that was. for about 2-3 years straight i couldn’t function without that stuff in my system. It was quite a challenge to hide my addiction (odour-wise) but I didn’t want to give it up just because ppl would give me weird stares and whatnot. I resorted to starting to use vape carts. Specifically 1g pens. At first it took me a month to finish one. But over time, it started to progress into 3 week spans before I’d finish a cartridge, then 2, and then 1. Finally, I was hitting 5 day marks where I needed another cartridge but either my dealer had none in stock or I simply just didn’t have sufficient funds to support my crippling addiction. All in all, I was hitting my pen every hour and a half minimum if I wasn’t feeling “high enough”. Considering I slept late/woke up late and would be awake for about 19hrs a day (not to mention sometimes I’d get up in the middle of the night just because my brain couldn’t sleep undisturbed… i no longer experienced REM sleep), I was basically hitting my pen about up to 20+ times a day or more and that’s just a wild guess..

I still remember walking out of my house in the freezing cold and just desperately trying to get high because I found some left over grass in my grinder (which was broken FYI)… and decided it would be a good idea to grind it up in a container with coins. I was literally rolling my weed up, trying to smoke the tiniest joint, freezing in an empty bus stop chasing this dopamine rush, feeling guilt and shame at the same and all at once. Finally getting high only for it to last 2hrs. Spraying febreeze on myself as soon as I got home for a good 15secs praying to god my family don’t smell it on me. Hiding in shame and paranoia in my room. A day later, scraping together just enough money to be able to buy a new cartridge. Like WOW now that I look back I don’t understand how I didn’t stop and just realize to which extent I was addicted to that shit and that it needed to STOP. Idk why but it’s okay because without my past self’s mistakes, present me wouldn’t be half as wise about everything I am these days.

Learn from your mistakes, grow and evolve. You’re not perfect no one is. But this addiction never defined you, it doesn’t now, and it never will. If you make the decision to quit today then keep yourself accountable. Each and every step of the way. No one is going to do this for you. You have to be willing to do what it takes each and every single day and be able to put yourself first before this or anything else in your life. Nothing else matters like you taking care of yourself does. Nothing matters more than loving yourself enough to let go of shit that doesn’t serve you anymore. Peace out my dudes. Sending you all love & success in your journeys; wherever you are.

This sure is a journey... Here's something I've learned along the way. I'm happy to answer any questions you have.



MYTH: there's a perfect time to quit. 

FACT: when you're addicted, you smoke on bad days to manage stress and numb other feelings, you smoke on good days to celebrate. You can find a reason to smoke every day. 



MYTH: you need to smoke to eat, sleep and create.

FACT: no one needs substances unless they get addicted. Once you withdraw you won't need it anymore either.



MYTH: you will become a different person sober.

FACT: fortunately or not, you'll stay the same, just not high all the time. You won't magically become super motivated and productive, acquire love for working out, or learn programming. You won't lose your charm, creativity and interests. 



MYTH: quitting will solve all of your issues.

FACT: it will only solve your addiction to this particular substance and help you save money. Quitting might actually reveal underlying mental health issues and/or unhealthy behavior patterns. Usually it's just the first step in the right direction. 



MYTH: withdrawals are very difficult, there's no way I can go through. 

FACT: a couple weeks of bad sleep and appetite is something that can happen even if you aren't addicted to anything - you might suffer a loss, a physical injury or just catch a flu. It's possible to get over it without substances, many people do. It's not permanent and you'll recover from most symptoms in a few months. Which is very little compared to time you've spent getting high.",335

Since then I really haven’t put myself out there.

But I just made plans to see a guy, and I want to vomit I’m so anxious. In the 5 months I’ve been free from weed, this has been one of the only things I’m still struggling with.

It's a comfort thing. I used to get depressed alot during Christmas time, (as I know many do) and I used weed as a way to feel comfy and feel happy. I've been really wanting to smoke. I have been looking for ""reasons"" to smoke. It's been cold where I live and there's no sun, I have S.A.D.S. going on and I really just felt like holing up in my room and smoking. I know I would enjoy it a lot.  
But I've made it 260 days, I don't want to break that streak because I know the length of the streak is psychologically significant to me. I've made it this far, I've been through worse, just gotta keep going. Though this will be my first Christmas in years where I'm not smoking.  
But even though all I wanted to do today was smoke, I went out into the cold and exercised in my yard even though it was raining and uncomfortable (I really dislike being cold), I went to the park to do some sprinting. I made the choice I know I should, but I'm still craving. I just wanna have that nice cozy feeling of being high and bundling up, watching something or playing video games. I'm posting this because this sub has been one of my main coping skills, when I crave I come here. So these thoughts won't be organized, it's just important for me to put them down, so I know what I'm dealing with.  
I've felt really sad feelings today, stressed, wanted to cry but couldn't get that going. Crying usually helps, maybe I can later. Anyways, it's a challenging day.

I experienced all the usual withdrawal symptoms - night sweats, crazy dreams, pounding heart, feeling overwhelmed and major anxiety. I thought I'd never feel normal again. I turned a corner after 4 weeks and I started to feel more like myself again. I still had the anxiety, especially in the mornings, but it wasn't as bad and I was able to start going about a normal day again. It's now been 5 weeks and today was the best day yet.

Everyone is different and I know the length and intensity of your symptoms depend a lot on how long you were using and how much. But it does get better. You do start feeling normal again. I know it's hard to believe that when it stretches into months and months. But you have to be strong. Be good to yourself. Eat well and get exercise. Your body needs to rebalance itself. It has incredible healing powers. Just trust it and stay strong. And don't give up. You're stronger than the drug. Don't let it beat you. 🤗",25

I lost a friend in a tragic accident, and barely three weeks later, I lost a close friend and ex-partner to suicide.

I began smoking daily to cope. On weekends, it was all I would do.

I’m on prescription medication for depression but I could still not cope with the weight of all my feelings, and the dreams. 

I pulled myself away from the suicidal thoughts, with weed as my life line. 

Amongst all of this, I started working full time in a high pressure environment, which further fuelled my addiction. 

But now, I’m struggling with smoking. I’m forgetful and it’s impacting my ability to work. I studied for five years to end up here and I can’t throw it away for weed. So many of my clients have done that, and I’ve had to help clean up the messes left behind.

I was in denial about my problem for so long, because “weed isn’t addictive”. And it may not be, not in the same way as other drugs but damn, you do get addicted to the escape, the feeling and everything that comes with it.

I guess I’m posting to hold my self accountable, and in the hopes that I can find a community here.

Im at work now, but when I get home, I’m going to try to quit. One day at a time.",3

At first I coped by telling myself it’ll get better, acknowledging it but pushing it to the side. It worked until it didn’t. It feels like I’ve just been existing for the past 2 weeks no emotions other than negative ones I don’t feel normal. 

All this coupled by health anxiety is truly taking a toll on my body. What started as no appetite has now turned into no desire to eat. I want to take care of myself, that’s why I quit but now I feel worse. 

I’ve missed my period completely this month I’ve lost 15 pounds. I had trouble sleeping now when I do I just wake up feeling groggy. A piece of my tooth just broke in my mouth. My eyes feel like someone put film in them. I have no access to medical care and even if could I have no way to get there or anyone to take me. At this point I think death is a better fit.",1

I work remotely, live alone, and haven't talked to another human in person in days because my friends are busy. I see friends every few days and usually at least once a weekend, and I'm going to hang out with people on Wednesday, but the days in between when I'm just alone are so fucking hard. I got so used to always having my best friend be right here every day.

I've dealt with bad cravings, but this really feels different, like I'm really going to relapse. Weed had a lot of negative effects on my life, but it really does help with loneliness and boredom.

I’m from Europe and from what I understand or what tv tells me (correct me if I’m wrong) the smoking habits in the states are a bit different. 
You guys mostly smoke “pure”, meaning you dont mix your weed with tabacco before rolling it up. Or use bong, pipe or other tools where you put the weed directly in.
Over here we mostly roll it up with tabacco.

So I was wondering if the amount used overall is significantly different.

My past use was 10-15gr a month. Thats a 100 euro’s worth.  How was it for you? And did you have or are you having severe withdrawal?!",50

I abused countless substances throughout my teenage years and early 20's. 
I eventually managed to quit all heavy drugs and alcohol by exclusively using cannabis.

I'm coming up on month 5 without cannabis, but in the past few weeks have fallen off the wagon for alcohol; 1-2 beers a day minimum. 
My need for a chemical unwind at the end of the day is still there it would seem. I fear that booze is ultimately worse  for me than the cannabis was, with the added danger that I will fall back into the drugs I used to abuse in my youth. I have a considerable stash (1lb) of homegrown that I haven't even tried, and feel like If be better off just getting off the beer and smoking what I have as it's enough to last me at least a year or two.

I went out and sat in the freezing cold, sat and watched random YouTube stuff and smoked some green.

Sure the first 20 minutes was fun but after that I was basically just doing what I could to not panic. It was not the experience I remember it being. It made me realise I was addicted to the ritual and not the drug- I just haven't replaced the ritual with anything I consider worthwhile yet, maybe a reason I ended up relapsing. I filled myself with obscene amounts of chocolate and crawled into bed with stomach ache.

I woke up late today feeling like I wasn't in my own body, hazy and droopy. I still had half a gram left which naturally I considered smoking, feeling guilty that I was even considering it. I eventually logic-ed my way to throwing it out and cleaning the clothes I smoked in and went to see my therapist.

What's good to know is that the 2 months work I've put in has not gone to waste and my vision of being clean and firing on all cylinders is still alive. Relapsing is never a good idea but I believe it was necessary for me in my position to be able to look at the bigger picture and my relationship with the drug.

I smoke 2-3 joints a day and I never take days off anymore. It's pathetic. I can't remember anything and I need it just to feel normal. This is no way to live in my next decade. Never can make it more than 2-3 days so I'm really going to be leaning on this group this time. I feel more determined than I have in a long time to get out of this haze and get control of my life back. I'm tired of being a slave to a plant. It's gonna be difficult because I'm a musician and partially everyone I know smokes weed. Being a social person, it's nearly unavoidable to be around weed unless I just stay home all the time and then I go stir crazy. It's going to be a challenge. 

Here's hoping this time can finally somehow be different and I'm proud of all of you that have gotten farther along on the journey.",17

quit it, 
youre lucky that you are mindful enough to even question it. its never too late to quit and its never too late to start working on yourself and start getting yourself somewhere. weed blinds you and makes you believe that you are satisfied. why would you ever want to hit a plateau when you can rather go upwards? sure its easier said than done. ive told myself 'tomorrow i start' for almost 4 whole months.
i didnt know what i was doing whilst i was doing it.
i wasnt enjoying my highs anymore... they werent highs. 
i wish i knew how to put my thoughts to words!!!!! ahhhh i wish i could persuade you all to stop. i guess youll all have to end up going through your own experiences to realise how bad of a drug it really is. for some people weed isnt bad... for people who question whether they should quit or not means weed is bad for you. weed isnt for you.

idk how to write ahhh but seriously, i wish i could help people. There is so much more to life idk.
if your life is already good with weed and you think youre doing good in all aspects in your life... thats a lie... they can be better!!! why would you ever want to not go up and keep going up??? hmm what im trying to say is...
say youve achieved all colours on the bouldering wall and you feel as if you are happy with that...wtfff man?? create your own complex colour and then conquer that one... and after that one create a harder one and then an ever harder one... keep achieving and growing, keep developing guyssss you cant do this whilst smoking weed every night i can tell you that much. idk ahhh im not good at explaining.

if things are shit and you think things cant get better no matter how hard you try... youre not trying hard enough or youre not giving it enough time.
changes that you are seeking dont happen or appear over night, they appear from time and effort. Even if you think youve given it enough time... you clearly havent. dont make time limits or goals like that... if anything dont even think about the end point... because there isnt one! it just goes up up up up up to (it can go down down down down down if you let it...but dont let it!!! take initiative) just keep going!!! stop weed stop weed everyone lololol xd i sound like a crazy person but i wish all of you knew that there is so much positivity and growth to discover! 

progress isnt linear but when i say up up up ... whatever ill show you a graph lol 
ok
i cant paste a graph apparently...
imagine this*
a graph where the line can go up and then down and then up and then down and then up again higher than the first few ups!
whatever,
if anyone understands this... thanks.
what im trying to say is everyone has relapses and ends up in situations worse than before on their progress journey (doesnt necessarily have to be worse, this is an exaggeration...) oik
i start again.
it can go up then it could go down again. BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT GO UP AGAIN.
so make it go up?
im lost. just stop weed, face your problems and your life face to face, get things done, do the things you say you will, one day you wont even have to tell yourself to do things anymore because you know to do it, i think everyone should practice mindfulness and meditation tbh XD. once i become more articulate ill redo another post where i am able to translate my thoughts better.



MY INITIAL POST:
has anyone experienced any stress or i guess high irritability during the first week or first few weeks sober?
any irritability and stress at all after quitting? 

i have been eating and exercising well (i eat whole foods and attend the gym and bouldering regularly). i have also been meditating and writing, i work a full time and perform great at my job since quitting( i work as an ortho assistant). i don’t feel stressed whilst at work or at the gym, but for some reason as soon as i get home i’m super -_-. 
i just get easily irritated and angry at something i feel i shouldn’t be irritated by… e.g. my house is getting renovated and i went to check on it and freaked out! i saw the house in a mess and just felt overly stressed and i quickly filled up with anger. (i’m 18 and i feeel as if i shouldn’t get stressed over stuff like this at my age. disorganisation seems to really irritate and stress me). due to the renovations, i’ve been staying with a friend. funnily enough the whole time i’ve been at my friends house i’ve had great sleep each night, i have woken up happy and energized for work everyday. 
i just want to know whether it’s weed that’s causing this irritability or if maybe i need to get a permanent change of environment. LOL this reddit post took a whole different turn whilst writing it. let me explain more:

today was a good day omg i think independence is what i need AHHHH if someone can help can you message me privately and chat about this.

okokok so i know that cws/paws are actually more common in women! especially the feelings of weakness, restlessness, abdominal pain yadah yadah yadah... everyone in this community probably already knows this ( im just assuming that people would have researched a lot too...idk maybe i just research too much xd... could be a big misassumption lol!) 

anyways i already know the answers to my own questions im asking, but for some reason i just want someone to say that they are in it too or that theyve been there too and that its going to be okay and that it does get better! or more so that one day ill be less stressed and less irritated by things i shouldnt be irritated by...

He tells us these things will bring us peace  and contentment , and that we will be able to control our desire. He also likes to whisper things such as ""it's only going to be 1 last time"" or ""this will help you"". But once we fulfill our desire, the devil runs away, and we feel depressed and disappointed with our choices. Always be aware of the devil, and his fake promises. He only wants to lead you to the path of your own self destruction. God tells us to do good things, to better our selves, and to take the devil as in open enemy. Weed/drugs/alcohol are tools that the devil uses to destroy societies, and peoples minds. Anytime you do something wrong, you feel it, you just know, that's your soul reaching out to you, your natural inclination towards god. Just wanted to finish off by saying, never take the devil as your friend, he is in open enemy!! I speak for myself or anyone who believes in God, but regardless you can use this post to help you.",5

I still miss smoking but do not crave it physically. I think that it might be that I am reminiscing on the old times I had with my friends and having an escape from reality. I always believed that I had a perfectly fine relationship with smoking as I went to school, worked, and played a sport. I think things took a turn for the worse when school went online, lost my job, and sports took a halt. This is when it became ""acceptable"" to smoke weed all day and play video games. In my mind, I was still getting paid and there was nothing else to do. I never thought twice about my smoking routine until a few months of this and for some reason I just thought I needed to quit. It took me a long time to put down the weed and every night I told myself ""this is the last time"". Many last times later, one day I just never re-upped again. 

The first few weeks sucked. The first few days I had a very hard time sleeping, sweat a lot, and had the most ridiculous dreams. Food wasn't good, video games weren't fun, and life just seemed completely bland. There were times where I couldn't focus and just laid on my bed unable to do anything at all. Within a couple weeks of quitting I started a new job and school began again, gyms opened and sports resumed. I have just been living without weed ever since. 

Some changes over time that I have noticed. I don't wake up groggy anymore and can focus on things slightly better again. I enjoy playing video games again but honestly sometimes I feel as if I want to start smoking again, that's why I made this post. I just do not want to feel like I threw away all this progress but I feel as if sometimes there really is no point to this. I just think about how my circumstances have returned to pretty much normal and wonder about smoking again. Sometimes I feel as if I am young and life is short and to just say fuck it as long as I can manage to balance work, school, life, and pleasure without it taking over. There are even times that I feel as if I was motivated more when I smoked and felt like I needed to earn it, but obviously that all changed when everything shut down and all I really had was weed and xbox.

The initial anxiety, lack of appetite/sleep sucked, but were good reminders that I need to change my life and make better choices. I was reading a bit (finished a couple books), sought out a therapist, and we have discussed things I should be doing to get myself out of this rut.

Now that the worst of the physical withdrawal symptoms have passed I find myself just mindlessly going through life. I am not picking up any books, meditating or going for walks. I am not trying new things. I am just pretty much doing what I did when I was stoned all the time. Sure, I feel more clear headed. But my depression is no longer masked, and I don't seem to be getting out of my comfort zone. I am not religious, so the inherent meaninglessness of life bothers me too. 

I know I need to start taking my life back, but my brain is just so used to not doing that that it makes it feel really hard. The only way to overcome this is to do something, anything, that I am not currently doing.

Though I am working out again, I am not working my legs because it is hard. I am surfing the web vs reading books because it is easier.

If you are still reading this, I guess the key takeaway is that I should have been focusing on my recovery everyday. Slowly changing my habits each day instead of slipping back into my old ways. It is never too late, so today I will give it another shot. Time to overcome the bullshit.

I'm 31 now and have been smoking weed regularly since 18. I primarily use it to cure boredom, reduce the noise in my head, sleep better, and because it generally makes me feel happier. My primary reason for quitting is not because of lifestyle (I feel my life has gone super well, despite being high for a lot of it). It's also not because of money or anything like that. It's because I know that smoking cannot be good for the lungs, and I fear that if I ever got lung cancer or COPD or anything like that later in life, I would never forgive myself, because the benefits of smoking just wouldn't outweigh the impact of such a disease. So here I am!! My last toke was the morning of Dec 8th. 
I have stopped for weeks and months many times, so it's not unfamiliar to me. However recently I've been smoking 1-3 joints per day, so this is feeling pretty rough. Really bad sleeps (feeling loopy lol), irritability, etc. I'm also coughing a lot which is concerning, but I'm hoping it's just clearing out my lungs. I've always exercised a lot, but no cardio currently, so I'm trying to ramp that up to help with the recovery. Any other tips to ease the lungs, reduce the coughing and speed up lung recovery?

I was recommended this reddit off a google search and thought why not join.

Have been smoking daily since about the age of 13 without any breaks but recently i have stopped some bad habits such as drinking and smoking cigs and thought to myself might as well quit this habbit.

I think its a good plant but it has got to the point where i have abused it ( can't sleep or eat properly without it) and need to stop.  Not once in those years have i thought about stopping apart from a holiday where its not available.

Just a simple question

Do you guys use any products in the first few weeks to get over the withdrawal for example to help with sleep and hunger.

Edit - if it makes any difference i've stopped smoking it in joints and vape the flower or use thc pens",5
2021-12-12 08:37:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rep691/quitting_after_15_years/,Quitting after 15 years,"I'm on day 3 of quitting after 15 years.

And it has multiple layers for me:

1. In the last 15 years I have been through some traumatic stuff, that I have delt with, kind of, but weed was always there to ""ease the pain"". I have no problems talking about what I went through when I feel safe. I have very good friends for that. But I don't think I fully processed everything either. I have a feeling that quitting weed could help me do that. But I'm also scared of feeling ""all of it"". Let's see what happens..
2. I have a smart preteen in the house and I found myself hiding from her for a few tokes, which was an eyeopener: this is addict behavior. Most of the the time I smoke when she goes to bed. During the day I work, so I'm not smoking. But sometimes in those few hours between work & her going to sleep I felt the urge and went out of sight for a few tokes. Same goes for the weekend. Why would you hide something if it is not harmful? The answer: I wouldn't want her to have the same habit. So there's that.
3. I read here a few times, that weed made it okay to be bored. I can relate to that to some level but for me, who is a creative person, I sing, write, paint, I am a bit of a DIYnerd, weed also was a gateway to creativity. I 've always done those things with weed and enjoyed it. Smoking was part of my creative proces, my creative space. Today I wanted to paint/make music but I didn't. I think it's because I'm not used to be in my creative space without weed. Am scared it will trigger me into wanting to smoke or that I will not ""feel the process"" like I used to and get demotivated. But the last thing I want is to stop being creative.

Can I get a witness?!",3

The brain fog above all else. I am basically vibrating and bursting at the mental seams at this point when I am high. It's as if I need to direct all of my mental energy on keeping my psyche together until I come down. This is unsustainable. 

The brain fog has been interfering with my life for the first time, as well. I need to gather a few more licenses for my job. I got a promotion and some continuing education is required so I can have the proper credentials when meeting with new clients. On account of my daily smoking in the form of multiple heavy sessions of huge bong rips and dabs, my morning brain fog got to a really insane point. I was always tired in the morning, and even when I banked 9-10 hours of sleep for a few weeks, nothing could stop the fog. Not even the 3x caffeine coffee beans I found! I failed my exams twice, and this is information that I learned a long time ago. The questions are flying over my head because I'm not processing them how I used to. I miss how sharp I was. I miss it so much. This has put me in a place where it has never been easier to quit. I've been confident and happy with the decision for the last 3 days, working my way through the intrusive thoughts with bravado. I can do this.

Day 3 - my grandmother has a stroke.

I woke up to screaming and my phone blowing up. It was as if someone held a candle to the left side of my grandmother's face, and it melted. Drool. I was utterly petrified and paralyzed with fear. Luckily we were able to get her to the hospital within the 90 minute window, but because of the COVID-19 patients on the floor with her, we were told to wash our hands and go home. I called the nurse at around 3:30 in the morning after her MRI, and there has been no noticeable improvement. Tomorrow is another round of testing and treatment at a more capable facility. It has already been so very difficult to fall asleep without weed, so there was never any hope of me sleeping tonight. Thank God I have another 24 hours before work on Monday. It's 6 in the morning as I write this, and I have spent my whole day, afternoon, late night, into the early morning staring at my computer screen and the wall behind it trying not to smoke as I wipe away tears. All of my supposed readiness to quit has been flushed down the drain. The only thing I want is to whisk myself away to cannabis land and forget about all of this for a few hours and play some video games, but that's what I've been doing at every difficult moment of my life for the last 6 years. If I can get through today, I can get through any day, or so I hope.

Thank you all for creating such a wonderful community. Having the outlet to write something out like this helps so much. If I lay this all on a friend it honestly would be too much, I don't want to burden anyone needlessly, especially so late at night (now, morning...). I look forward to providing as much support as I can as I go through this process with all of you.

But still having a problem getting to sleep.,"Finals are finally over and I have graduated from university. Yay! I reached 1 month as of the day I graduated and everything has improved from here; my dental care, upkeep with house chores and general improved cleanliness, less fatigue, eating much healthier, more motivated and less scared for the future despite this new chapter in life. Way, way less anxiety, no more racing thoughts and thinking all of my friends secretly hate me. I have generalized anxiety disorder but as it turns out weed makes it 10x worse even if social situations are fine in the moment, I used to spiral after the fact. I was definitely done with weed before but noticing the difference in anxiety has really sealed the deal for me and was one of the big reasons I stopped in high school aside from pressure to stop from my legal guardian (and of course started again in college). I even got my dreams back!

Except that's kind of part of the problem. My dreams have been *fucking strange*. I started keeping a dream journal a couple of weeks after I quit and started getting my dreams back, and got really intense dreams from cold meds when I got sick. My dreams make it hard to want to sleep.

I've also tried and failed many times to get my sleep schedule back on track. Finals did me in because I generally tend to find the most motivation to write papers after the sun goes down. I have always struggled with getting to sleep at night in HS before weed, but I guess since I smoked daily since freshman year of college I just wrote it off as a teenager thing. I do not think it is a teenager thing. I've thought about telling my psychiatrist because everything I've read about quitting smoking has said that getting to sleep shouldn't be an issue by now. :(

Does anyone else struggle with sleeping after one month into quitting? I'm not sure whether this is just a quitting weed thing or a sleep issue unrelated to weed use that I should probably (and will) get checked out. It just sucks because sleep came so easy when smoking although I'd just be tired still when I woke up and fatigued all the time. Putting my phone down doesn't work and I just stay up.

Then I'll be tired the next day from staying up til 5 am and waking up around 10-12 (for finals). 4-5 hours a sleep a night it catching up to me and I'll be wanting to sleep most of the day but not fatigued like I used to be. Tiredness doesn't get to me as bad, but I'll still feel it by 7 or 8 pm, sleep for an hour and then be wired til 5 am.
Aggghhh.

Edit: I know this may not be the most positive post ever but I thought this sub was for mutual support, jeez... Like I said in a comment below, we may have spent years smoking and the reality is that not every withdraw symptom is going to completely go away in just a month. But a whole hell of a lot does improve in weeks, if not days. After one week I felt a significant improvement in my overall mood and motivation. If you need something uplifting check out my other post of a list of reasons to quit and think of maybe making your own. It's very helpful to have a reminder of why you quit in the first place. I don't know, I don't really get why everything I post here has to be positive for the benefit of other people. I was looking for support. But I made it a month. Go me. You can do it too.",1

I want so badly to just be okay and live a long and happy life - I am never touching marijuana again. But sometimes, like right now as I write this post, I get in my own head too much and worry about these awful things like what if I’ve injured my brain or what if I develop a neurological condition like schizophrenia. I have no symptoms of it or family history, but when I have these bouts of anxiety or panic attacks these are legitimate worries/triggers. Am I screwed?

After I moved to Oregon it seems the weed flow was neverending and I fell hard into the habit. I was buying 30$ ounces almost 2-3x a week and buying blunts by the carton. 

Long story short this year I decided that it was not benefitting me and I was spending more time smoking then doing things I actually wanted to do and I took about a 3 week break. 3 weeks later I smoke with a friend and continue the habit just like I used too. Things were not the same tho.

Before I never really had anxiety or anything of the sorts when smoking but this time around I was getting very intense anxiety and panick attacks. 

At the turn of December I decided to stop smoking for the rest of the year minimum but after a bad day I decided to take a few bong hits. At first I felt fine but after eating some chips my arm starting tingling and my heart rate was about 160 while laying in bed. I thought I was gonna die and or that I was having a heart attack. This went on for about 3-4 hours and I was about to call 911 but my roommates showed up and I hung out with them till I felt calm enough to try and fall asleep. 


I have no idea where this crippling anxiety and panick attacks came from, as I said I have been smoking for 7 years and never had any anxiety like this, smoking or not. It is really scary for me and luckily I think this experience was enough to finally make me quit. I didn't want it to ever get to this point but I guess sometimes it takes a big wake up call like this...

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get this off my brain. 

Tl;Dr I smoked and thought I was having a heart attack, now I'm scared to even try smoking again.",1

2021-12-11 10:24:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/re1z6a/baby_steps/,Baby steps,"41 Year old here, exactly 1.5 years sober today after smoking for 25 years - over half of my life. I wanted to live the rest of my life sober so I figured out how to work towards that goal.

Weed started off innocently enough, slow and gradual. No major side effects, a few lost hours here and there, wasting only my lawn mowing money. Some minor infractions with my parents when they discovered what I was doing. Over the months and years that followed though those lost hours and money added up. Quietly and insidiously other things started to be impacted. My social skills didn't develop and neither did my general coping skills. The person I became as an adult was highly shaped by my addictive use of weed from my youth.  My motivation was affected, my relationships, my general life decisions. It was hard to see because otherwise I had a fairly normal and successful life. Weed took things away in baby steps and I never really noticed until the damage it had caused was too big for me to not notice or ignore. Day by day and little thing by little thing the truly minor negative effects of weed accumulated to something much larger. Baby steps.

I sat here this morning inspired to write and share after having been up since 4:15 AM as  I was so  excited about what I had planned for today. When I took a break from my mornings work I started reflecting on my life since I stopped using weed and while its obvious, this concept of small steps occurred to me with clarity.

You see, weed may have taken away a lot of good things in my life by chipping away with baby steps yet that is exactly how I reclaimed my life as well. Bit by bit, small baby steps - one at a time. Things really sucked when I first stopped smoking weed, but thanks to past experience, counselling and communities such as this I knew that it would suck. I was prepared. In the beginning it was hour by hour, then eventually day by day and now month by month I'm reclaiming my life.  Baby steps.

Things didn't get better all at once or after a certain period of time. It was me being persistent, like I had persisted previously with my weed use, that got me out of the mess I was in. In the beginning getting through a single day without relapsing was a challenging but a realistic and achievable goal. As time went on I took on larger and larger goals. Those lofty goals were achieved through small baby steps. Each day I'd take a small step, it was pretty insignificant at the time and didn't seem to matter much. Those small baby steps each day are like all the minor negative things that weed did to me along the way. It was the repetition and persistence that really made the big differences in the end.

Today I'm a much more confident person, more at peace, more in control and I now have direction and a better understanding of how I can measure my growth as a person. Things may seem hard and out of reach, and the reality is today they are, but if I take a step towards them today, tomorrow and so on as small as it may be I'll eventually get there. Sometimes I'll fail, sometimes I'll take the wrong path and I make mistakes, things go bad. It's okay though because I know that once I figure it out I can start over and start taking those baby steps again. The slow progress at first was frustrating but once your efforts start to pay off its very rewarding and I learned about patience being a virtue.

I didn't think I'd ever find my way out honestly. Two years ago I was a confirmed and committed stoner - a true stoner of stoners. Weed was my life - I thought I ""loved"" it. I identified with it and I revered and respected it. To this day I think its a fascinating species with some legitimate uses - some of which I wish I could still apply to my life but I understand fully that its just not a tool I can use anymore. We had our time.

I hope that you, wherever you are on your journey, can find some meaning in your life, a reason to get out of bed each day and do something that means something to you and those you love. Though its been said many times, life is short. We really need to make the best of each moment. Sometimes in the chaos of life we'll forget about that and its okay as long as we can bring it back in and remind ourselves to be present and of our purpose and meaning.",79

No more deals with myself, I need to quit forever.","I posted here about a year ago. A big post really helped me give it up for about 3 months. Those were the best and most productive months of my life. I slowly started saying ""oh I can smoke once"" or ""Okay only on the weekends"" until I was back to my old habits. Almost worse. Since I knew I was aiming to quit I'd smoke so many spliffs, telling myself it was okay, until I was sick. Only to wake up the next morning ashamed, the only cure being to numb myself with weed all over again. A terrible groundhogs days where I would have to smoke to escape my reality. 

&#x200B;

I'm ""high functioning"" I guess. I live in Brooklyn, I do stand up, I'm constantly socializing and meeting people, I have a lot of friends (those who smoke and those who don't), yet something is holding me back. Professionally, personally, romantically. In the back of my mind all I would want to do is give up, go home and shut out the world and get high alone. Yet doing that, shutting myself off from other people, makes me incredibly depressed. Why am I committed to this behavior if it just harms me and makes me feel worse? Weed does not even feel good anymore. Maybe the ritual of rolling a spliff is relaxing, but immediately after I feel so terrible and ashamed that I'm wasting my prime. 

&#x200B;

I've been smoking so much weed ever since I was 14yo and I'm 27 now so I do not even know what a normal looks like. Have I already ruined myself? Those were such formative years... I feel like I'm very blessed in life, my friends and family, but at the same time...  I feel like I have accomplished almost nothing (romantically I'm a joke and career wise I'm just wadding in the water)

&#x200B;

Those few months of sobriety, I felt so capable, so in control, sleep felt great and sex felt better. I had some of the best shows of my stand up career. I want that back 

&#x200B;

Anyway I quit about 9 days ago. I don't even crave the stuff, mostly I'm just suffering from brainfog, insomnia, and everything is boring to me lol, probably bc my dopamine and reward center of my brain need to re-adjust. The only thing that feels good is exercise bc I can leave my mind for a second. 

&#x200B;

Sorry if this post is chaotic, but I feel very chaotic at this point in time.

This has been something I’ve sort of wanted to do for awhile but then I’d get low on flower and go to my good friend to reup.

6 days off weed, feeling really really awesome. I'm 40 and really started smoking regularly around the age of 23. I wasn't the dude who smoked every day all day, but usually would at the end of the day. *(SIDENOTE: with how POWERFUL weed is today, as opposed to seedy leafy, unscientifically grown stuff from the 1970's, just smoking at the end of the day is still a lot of THC).*

But I'm 6 days off and I'm realizing a lot. Like most of you, I don't want to create some black and white narrative where weed is EVIL! I think cannabis has a utility. Obviously, there's a lot of medicinal purposes, and heck, there are even some high-strung folks that could really BENEFIT from smoking a joint for a change. 

But for a LOT of us, it's not SERVING us yet we continue to smoke.

It's a powerful medicine and powerful medicines can be good, but with powerful medicines, you usually don't take them EVERY DAY (unless you have some gnarly surgery or something). But if you don't have said gnarly surgery, you probably don't need to smoke like you did.

My weed smoking (I'm now learning with clarity and perspective) really just made me paranoid. I would get high, and would soon feel guilty about getting high but then would find myself craving it (even though I knew this pattern was happening!) the next day! It's literally the textbook definition of unhealthy addiction. 

Also, I think it made me a shittier boyfriend. It's just what I always wanted to do. And even when I would smoke with my girlfriend, weed would just make us melt in a puddle in our bed and watch Netflix like blobs. Netflix can be awesome, but when that's ALL you do, that's just not awesome boyfriend-ing.

Right now, in this moment in time, we're actually getting some confusing signals. All of us probably agree weed should be decriminalized. People thrown in jail for weed are disproportionately black. The drug war has been unquestionably racist. People in jail should have their records expunged. 

But...

When you READ everything I wrote right there, it almost makes it look like weed is the ""good guy"" and that's where it gets really confusing. ALL of that can be true...but weed can still be a really powerful (addictive) medicine that can kinda mess you up if you do it in excess. 

So yea. Sorry if this was super disjointed (it's probably the detox) but I love and appreciate all of you and wish you nothing but the best on your journey. Stay with it. My first 3 days really sucked, but I just feel a lot better now.

Time to quit.,"I started smoking 2 years ago, usually just on the weekends. Over the last two months I've noticed that I will smoke any time I can make time for it: Early enough in the morning before work or school, on breaks, and really just when I don't have a basic responsibility to anything else that day. I don't read anymore and I'm not as passionate about my schoolwork or job as I used to be.
I moved away from home about 5 years ago, but always had a daily connection to my parents with my phone. Since I've started smoking I've replaced most of that family-phone-time with smoking weed; and I rarely call anymore. 

This morning, I put my Mom on hold on the walk from my car in the parking lot to my apartment. By the time I got into my apartment, I already forgot my Mom was on hold, and was in front of the ash tray and smoking within a minute of walking in the door. I didn't even realize I left her on the line until about an hour later. This hit me really hard and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the hard fact I've been intentionally ignoring:

If I'm not in class or at work, I'm smoking.

I want to talk to my parents daily again, I want to care about my schoolwork again, and the most effective way to get there is to quit smoking.

I haven't missed a day smoking in 2 years, and I smoke between 2-5 joints a day depending on what I got going on. I don't really know anyone where I'm staying so my face to face support circle is pretty thin. I'm appreciative of this group and hope I can come back here when I experience hard cravings which I'm sure are to come.",10

Seems like I’ve messed up every single opportunity I’ve ever had, down to relationships and friendships and having good connections with my family. Also going from being a manager at a job where we just parked and drove nice cars all day to mind numbing work in a warehouse sucks. 

I got a 1900 on my SATs but almost failed out of high school because I was depressed and smoked too much. Failed to network at that pivotal age where you can make friends super easily. Now I’m on a weird course in life. I don’t want to work in a warehouse. I don’t know what I want to do. All I know is that I want to smoke weed. All I did, for a whole year of collecting unemployment, was sit around and smoke weed. Maybe one month worth of trips and actual relaxing, but mostly just smoking weed and drinking and eating out and wasting money. Didn’t even pay off any of my debts with my unemployment money.

The 1st week was rough but the 2nd week I was feeling pretty good. This week it feels like the 1st week all over again. My anxiety is through the roof as soon as I open my eyes. My depression is at and all time high and I'm feeling so low and beat up. I'm tearful and panicky and just not fun to be around. I had a bad trip with an edible a few months back and the next day got really sick. Been to the ER, GP and a cardiologist - the only thing that came up was a positive ANA but other test says I'm fine. I've been in therapy since October and have tried numerous medications to combat my anxiety and depression and nothing has worked as of yet. I have a physiatrist  appointment on the 15th but man has it been really tough.

I feel like I'm wearing down on my boyfriend and family and have alot of guilty feelings about my mental health. I stopped smoking to see if things would change but now I'm like is it gonna get any better? Should I just smoke a bowl and see how I feel? I smoked since I was 14 years old (29 now) to help with my depression/anxiety and my mind is saying maybe it will help now even though the edible is what kinda started all this. Just need some reassurance I'm doing the right thing. My mental health is shot to shit and I just want it all to stop.

After a few months of weekend only use I started smoking more often I'd smoke a couple times through the weekday after school/work and I felt fine doing so. 

 I eventually started smoking daily 24/7. During this time weed and phycidelics were the only thing on my mind and I felt like that was enough for me. But as time passed the heavy usage started affecting my mental state, whenever I smoke I now become anti social, anxiety ridden, and unmotivated and I've been in a constant thought cycle that this was OK that weed was enough for me to be happy, I don't need people, hobbies, self discipline. Weed filled the void until it became the void ever feeding into itself. I tricked myself into believing this was how it had to be for me to be happy with weed but I'm not happy, and I know that! it just feels so much easier to numb myself until Nobody and nothing matters to me anymore but this is the addiction talking not me, NOT me. I desperately wanna break out of this cycle but it feels like such an impossible cycle to break out of with how long I've been using. But if I was on my death bed right now I would regret not giving up weed and living life, I try to remember this as much as possible, this is something I want but not my addicted brain, I've heard it gets easier as time goes on and I notice the positive effects of not smoking almost immediately, clearer mind, body, and spirit, but there's always that thought to go back to it, to pretend I can moderate my usage beyond daily use, but I know I can't weed is just too much of a dopamine boost for anything other then that to be on my mind, lower dopamine activities will always be secondary in my weed dependent state of mind. 

I now want to hold myself accountable for my weed usage. Today is the day I break away from this cycle into a life that's better then this never ending cycle of trying to find my life's purpose in a substance. All I have to do is give up one thing to experience everything else life has to offer.

 I hope with the support of this community and in myself I can find a better life without needing a crutch I want freedom. I have a long hard journey ahead but I know it's what I need. So hello all! let's go on this new step of life together! We can do this.",7

I'm in a lot of emotional and physical pain right now, I've read symptoms peak around a week. I just wanted to hear your experience. I also wanted to know if these symptoms will dissipate.

Was there a certain timeline where you started to feel better? What do you think was the best thing that happened to you after you quit? My cravings are so bad and I feel so sick. I just want to get over this hill and be done for good.

Today I'm celebrating my first week without THC in years. Two major changes, the first one is that yesterday for the first time ever I was able to refuse a joint that was passed to me by a friend, big achievement.

The second, and the most amazing change, is that for the first time in 15 years, I m starting to imagine a life without it. Until now, I was trying to give up the joints mostly because of the tobacco inside. Whenever I was trying to give up tobacco I would start to smoke pure weed, I would prepare butter and cook weed, vaporize weed, vape weed oil, smell weed compulsively, whatever, I could have put it in my ass if someone told me it would make an effect. 

And something is slowly moving inside me, I think I m ready to cope with life without THC, and it feels very empowering. 

So yes, one week in, and hopefully way more to come! 

Thank you sweet community, you are of great inspiration.

Peace",6

I just can’t wake up like this anymore. Always nauseous and “hungover”, my brain feels so slow and weird in the morning. Well not in the morning, in the afternoon, when I wake up, because I can’t wake up, because I get incredibly high the night before, every, fucking, night. 

I realized I’m addicted when I wanted to stop and couldn’t. 

I’ve been wanting to stop for weeks, even months at this point. I just can’t. I’m not only emotionally addicted to this plant, I think I’m physically addicted too. Whenever I don’t smoke for over 12 hours, I feel super weird and anxious and I get sweaty and shakey. (I’m also addicted to nicotine, which I also want to, tried to, and couldn’t quit) Most of the times I go to my balcony for my bong I don’t even want to get high, I just don’t wanna feel like shit sober. 

I can’t focus on anything, even when I’m not high. 
Also, now that I am constantly at least a little high, my brain just always feels fried and tired and confused. 

I’m actually doing decent in school which is so shocking because I never go to class or do the readings, I just bullshit all the assignments like an hour before they’re due, and keep getting 70s and 80s. 

I am actually interested in my degree and wish I would participate in class and do the readings and actually LEARN. I know I could be getting 100s if I actually tried. And fuck a grade, at least I would be growing and learning and actively participating in my education, thats what I’m really after. 

I just feel like I’m constantly letting myself down, or I’m wasting my intellect and potential. 

There’s so much I want to do. I have so many ideas. Everytime I pick up a joint instead of a paintbrush or a pen I’m robbing myself of something. Something important and special that I’m scared I’ll lose if I keep this up. 

And still, everytime I tell myself this is it, I’m not gonna smoke today (even if I tell myself I’m not gonna smoke until before bed once I’ve finished all my responsibilities) I end up smoking before breakfast. 

The guilt is so strange, I can feel how heavy it is. Lying to yourself is not the vibration I’m down for. Fucking hell. 

I definitely have CHS, although I had a terrible case of it last year which landed me in the ER for 5 hours, I can feel it getting worse and worse each morning. 

This plant is fucking with my appetite, my sleep, my serotonin, my clarity, my desires and my priorities. 

I know I want to change. I even know HOW I can change. 

It’s just so fucking hard. If I feel that bad after 12 hours fuck knows how bad I’m going to feel after 48 hours… and I know the quitting symptoms get worse each day that I delay……

Ugh. I just feel so tired. Mentally and physically. I want to be strong enough for myself. Like there’s two versions of me, one is the addict and the other is the wiser, loving whole version of myself, just begging the addict to choose love and choose themselves over a fucking plant. 

I’m also aware that I must be smoking to numb some internal pain..I’m not sure what that pain is. I think starting seeing a therapist when I quit would be a smart thing to do, at least for the beginning. 

I have exams this week, one of which I’m worried I’m going to fail because of how little I’ve been going to class, so I need to study a lot. I think waiting until exams are over to fully quit would also be a smart thing to do, instead of dealing with the stress of both simultaneously. 

I don’t know what this was honestly. I just woke up and spent 2 hours in bed because I’m too fucking tired to get up and I’m too fucking nauseous to have breakfast. And I knew the exact reason why I feel this way. I just don’t want to be dependent ON A FUCKING PLANT anymore. 
I know what I need to do. I just need to do it. 
Venting helped as well. 
If you read this far down, thank you. Idk how to end it other than saying I’m glad I discovered this sub. Hopefully you’ll see another post next week about my first few quitting days symptoms.

I started smoking over a girl. I fell in love and she said she loved me too. Things were good, but slowly she started to treat me like I wasn't good enough. That's when my problems started. I boxed at that age and was fit as a fiddle and super determined and confident. Started smoking weed and got fat and ugly. 

I had a break when I was 18 as I was a bone marrow donor to my sister. But other than that I smoked weed everyday just getting by becoming socially withdrawn not cutting my hair or beard. She eventually left me after we both went to uni because she was going to be a dentist and I was working in a call centre. Even when I was working there I spent most my money on weed and munchies. All I cared about was the next smoke so I could forget everything. My dad leaving us, my girlfriend leaving and having no money. 

I tried to quit to fix myself as the depression and thought of killing myself got too much. I packed my bags and moved to China. I was a teacher there and battled homesickness and anxiety but weed stayed on my mind I didn't smoke unless it was in my holidays and I'd travel to another country. It's the death penalty in China for 10 grams. 

Funnily enough without weed I became this popular teacher and went from the school wanting to sack me to becoming head of department within 2 years. Wherever I worked people loved me or grew to love me very quickly. And I was told by people all the time. I have an infectious personality. 

But weed was always on my mind. I found a way to grow it there. And would look forward to when I could smoke. After the pandemic I got stuck in the UK after coming to see family on holiday. I smoked almost 3 grams a day. 

Now I'm on my dream course to teach. I tried to quit before it started but I kept saying to myself a little is okay. It made me lazy, lethargic, not care. I nearly failed my first placement and had crippling anxiety. I was smoking Thursday, Friday, Saturday and suffering withdrawal through the rest of the week for 8 weeks flat. It got too much and I had an emotional breakdown. Every time I would go 4 days without it, I would become productive and caring and spend time with my family. Every time i smoked it, I became depressed snappy horrible and I couldn't remember what I was doing for my lessons. 

 Yesterday was my last smoke. I'm done with it. I have to pass this course next term and I know if I continue smoking I will ruin my life. 

I was a confident, strong smart teenager. Now I'm on the brink of ruin. It's time to let go of the bull**** that is weed. Become unstoppable again and grow up.",23

At first, it's just fun.  Smoke before an event to loosen up my social anxiety.  Then it turns into ""let me smoke so this task I dislike is more fun"" and ""I'm just going to smoke this one day at work because Mondays suck"".  Before I know it, it quickly spirals into being high every minute of every day, waking up with anxiety and smoking instantly, taking breaks every 30 minutes from social gatherings to go smoke more or hitting a vape constantly.  Lying to all my doctors and therapist, dropping out of all the activities that were providing me support. Suddenly I'm drifting through life, inside my high little brain, not taking in the world around me, not forming new memories, not sleeping well, not caring about my job or health or responsibilities, and losing friends.  

It's comfortable because I'm skipping through all the parts of life that I dislike or give me anxiety, but at the same time I'm skipping all the parts of life that are wonderful and meaningful.  You can't just block out the bad parts of life without blocking out all of it.

I'm on my 3rd try quitting in the last two years.  My withdrawals are hell, which you would think would motivate me not to pick it back up again, but of course it doesn't.  Once my momentum wears off and the depression kicks in, I instantly start looking for something to fill that hole that's left behind.  

I want to be present in my life. I'm amazed at the person I become once the sickness wears off.  I like that she's motivated and has so much energy.  It's just the sitting in discomfort that I'm still working on.

Lots of love to all the babies that are quitting.  It can feel really lonely, but I see more and more people across platforms identifying that they have a problem with it.  Can't wait to come back to this sub one day and say I've been sober for over a year and this is how I did it.

Most of all I have a strong sense of pride in what I've accomplished and I can't wait to hit the next day of sobriety, every single day. 

It took me going through a lot of shitty things because of my weed use to reach this incredibly strong desire to get clean, but I'm here and I'm very grateful 🙏 

It gets better, ""just keep swimming""

Love you all, what a fantastic community ❤",10

Smoked thru 5 or 6 months, using weed to cope with the stress my first year of uni was giving me. BAD IDEA! Eventually, I found this community and have been trying to be somewhat active. I decided to quit because I was finding it difficult to focus on most things. My speech was getting worse, I couldn't remember too well what I was about to say and I just didn't want to do it anymore. I wasn't having fun, I was numbing myself.
So I bought a bike. Started biking almost everyday, got into therapy, started scheduling my life again and got back on the piano. Some of these things I'm still trying to get better at, since I can get incredibly lazy. 
I relapsed on the morning of thursday, around 4 months since I had decided to quit. I'd been frequenting my stoner friends for a couple weeks, so I said ""well, what could possibly go wrong?""
It was a pretty bad experience. I instantly got anxious, started having a couple of bad thoughts, felt guilty and as if all my progress had been erased, and had to take a couple breaks to chill out, even then it was pretty bad. I was feeling insecure all of a sudden, and very self concious. Nah, this is not for me. So I'm quitting for good. Now two days later I'm feeling good, not too anxious, ready to get back im the schedule and do some activities this weekend. I'm getting back into therapy soon, as well, and I'm gonna do some real biking around the city.

I'm ready to leave weed behind, this time for good. I've learnt from this experience. It's not only that I am bored or stressed and I do not know how to cope with these feelings yet, but that I have to learn and find other ways to hang out with these people that do not include weed, and get new people in my life as well. Good luck to you all on your journey, I'm here if you need to talk.",7

2021-12-10 04:06:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rd4npr/adicction_and_grieving_the_ones_we_love/,Adicction and Grieving the ones we love,"I am 35 years old and have been smoking weed daily for the last 10 years. I used to be a lively, resourceful, optimistic, sociable and active person. Nothing remains of that person. Smoking has led me not to advance in my goals and my life path. It has made me feel like a failure to myself and my family. It has destroyed my hobbies and my creativity. My capacity for work and commitment. My addiction makes me feel inferior and foolish for not being able to control it. But I have already accepted that I am an addict, as was my grandfather, my aunt, and many other people in my family. Addiction is in my genes, but how to deal with it is in my power. Or so I try to think.

1 year and 2 months ago my brother passed away in an accident. We were really close. He was my best friend, the only person in my family that I could talk to and be myself, the only one who loved me for who I am and accepted me for who I am, not just because I was his sister. He was my role model, my comarade and partner in crime. My favourite person, period. I miss him so much that my chest hurts physically. From that day on, my addiction got out of hand, spending all day at home, lighting one after another, waiting for nightfall to finish the day. I feel hopeless and emotionally disconnected. I am not interested in people, activities, work, studies ... Nobody knows what happens, not my family or the few friends I have. I'm good at pretending and I don't want them to know how I feel. My parents are already feeling bad enough losing their first child for me to give them more shit.

In the last few months I have also lost two of my best friends and my relationship with my boyfriend of 10 years came to an end. I feel like I've reached a dark point and recently found myself having suicidal thoughts. That triggered my alert, because after they lost my brother, I could never do that to my parents. Also, it scares me that if I die like this, I won't be able to see my brother again in the afterlife.

It may not be the best time to quit, as withdrawal makes me feel even sadder and more passive, and really anxious, but I am aware that it is a chemical reaction in my body.

Today is the second day that I will go without smoking. At a time when everything seems to be falling apart around me, quitting is perhaps one of the few things that makes me feel good about myself and in control of some aspect of my life. I don't think my life will magically improve just by quitting smoking. But it will be an improvement in some way.

I've also thought about going to therapy, since apart from you, strangers on reddit, I have no one to talk to about all this. Has anyone been to therapy? Has it helped you with your addiction? Do you think we smoke to mask the pain?

I would appreciate any answers or advice, and feel free to share your experiences of addiction and / or loss. Recognizing yourself in others sometimes helps. I send you love, people.",10

My last bowl was Monday night (third night in a row it was the “last” bowl) but I’ve been pushing though since Monday. 

It’s incredible just how much I’m starting to feel myself again just after a few days, I feel like I’ve been masking my true personality for a long time now. Looking back on the past year or so, it all seems like such a blur, I think the depersonalization and intrusive thinking that really started to set it since covid literally had the wheel the whole time, like I wasn’t even retaining much or remembering jack shit the entire time because I was so fucking internally chaotic, to the point where I couldn’t even eat when I smoked because I was so detached from reality. 

There’s a part of me that really wishes I journaled more during this time, to try and understand what was going on in hindsight more, but you know what, fuck it, I’m not gonna obsess over wasted time where I felt mentally and psychological destroyed, all I know is weed is not the same experience it used to be AT ALL, and that whole time it was doing nothing except remaining part of my routine, and that routine wrecked me but I continued to follow it, and now with my lucidity slowlyyy coming back I’m sitting here like “why THE FUCK did I let that go on so long, there were days I literally thought I was losing my mind” but it was just that much a of deep rooted crutch for me, even tho I felt like I was losing it most days I still felt the need to do it, I still felt the need to escape reality every chance I had even if that meant smoking weed and dissociating, laying in bed for hours trying to remember a conversation I had the previous day. Well never again, I’m done. My appetite is out the window and I can’t sleep worth a shit but I’d rather go through this temporary withdrawal than slip back into that broken record of misery.

2) You’ve physically beaten me from the inside out
3) You are a total golddigger! Because of you, my wallet is always empty.
4) I feel like I can’t be social when I am with you. I want to be more trustworthy and accomplished, which I can’t do if I’m sneaking around with you.
5) Our relationship is taking an emotional toll, as well. I don’t want to crave you when I’m unhappy anymore; I’d rather have self-respect.
6) When you’re with me, I risk legal/community issues; you are nice for a fling and all but not worth my dreams of becoming a nurse, nor risking my relationships.

Disclaimer: Wall of text. Thank you for your time to read it! :)

I have used weed as a crutch for many years. Although I have had periods where I put it down for one reason or another, those reasons were because I had no choice but to quit. And with time I'd always come back to it. I have never made a true effort to quit by choice. 

I just finished my fall semester at my university, and although I passed, I didn't make it easy on myself with my habit. I became more aware how much this habit holds me back. It makes me not want to do anything, it makes me procrastinate and put things off, and it causes a general lack of energy and cloudiness. On top of that, I spent way too much money on it. I am currently tight on cash and picking up part time work to help myself out. I feel ashamed that I have let my habit control me this much.

I try to uncover the true reason why I rely on weed so much. I think I have felt an existential boredom for awhile. And although I make efforts to cure this in a healthy manner, sometimes the effort required to do this can be overwhelming. And as a result, I use weed as a crutch to feel okay with this boredom. 

I have felt this way for years. I have moved to a new city and finishing school. I try to make real changes to fulfill myself. But I keep coming back to this habit to deal with it. I went to the gym this morning, and it was a nice overcast day (I love those days when it's cloudy and doesn't rain). And I felt compelled to cruise the backgrounds near my house with a joint to some tunes. It is a ritual that puts me in a safe bubble. It disconnects me from life. And it scares me how often I chose to throw away time and money to perform this ritual that really doesn't do much for me. Especially if I plan to do something that day.

I'm also scared about trying to quit because both my roommates are pot heads. I am looking for a new place and have something potentially lined up. Their weed habits aren't the main reason I decided to leave, but it is definitely  a reason for sure. I just know that if I quit cold turkey, they are gonna feel weird about me not wanting to partake. Last time I quit one of them kept trying to reel me back in. And I eventually succumbed. I really want to get out of here to help aid my process.

Overall I am worried. I have failed to get this out of my life. I have tried to have a healthier relationship with weed, but it always ends up me overdoing it and needing it to feel normal and okay. It causes more negative things in my life than positive ones, but I know that breaking this cycle will be one of the most difficult things I will do in my adult life. I want to spend more time focused on my school work and career. I want to spend my free time pursuing healthier hobbies. Fishing, golf, working out, writing. Weed makes me not want to do any of this. 

As far as how I will quit, I bought a vape to help substitute it. I don't want to, but it seems to help. I have a few nugs left. I have heard people say that weening yourself off helps. But I kind of feel like cold turkey would be better. I have no clue.

Thank you for reading my wall of text. I really appreciate this community and hope ya'll can be a form of support for me. As I have stated many times, this is a huge step for me, and I have a lot of fear about it. About being stuck and wasting more and more time, money, and energy.",2

Two weeks later, I bought some weed and have been smoking for the past two days although I haven’t smoked today up to this point.

I was having a really rough evening and caved. Should have reached out to someone, but my pride got the better of me. I wish I would make more of an effort to build a network, but I find it hard to relate to people when I’m really feeling off. Catch 22.

I remembered how bad it was last time but I got the fuck its. Rather than beat myself up over it, I’m going to take this time to be kind to myself. I’ve learn a lot in my sobriety and this can just be a blip in my timeline.

This is too miserable to drag on for much longer, weed doesn’t affect me like it used to. And cravings are back full force. Haven’t slept much the last few days, too high. I’m definitely afraid of the withdrawal because sometimes I don’t sleep and enter a scary headspace, but hopefully it won’t be too bad after just 2 days. Already withdrawing and it’s not comfortable.

Just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve been through this rigmarole enough times to know that I don’t have to make any huge changes or plans, that I just need to dust myself off and get back up again, and take it one day at a time. Just gotta face the fear and jump back in.",83

I’ve been a regular smoker since I was 15 and i’m now 19. Last night I had one of the worst weed induced panic attacks of my life. I was laying in bed shaking uncontrollably and having muscle spasms, seriously thought I was on psyche’s ! Never again. 

Quitting is going to fucking suck. I have Autism and ADHD and Anorexia, BPD and severe childhood trauma. I used weed as a coping mechanism for all those things since therapy hasn’t worked for me (was in therapy from ages 12-18) 

Really don’t know what the future holds so all tips, advice, support are highly appreciated!

2021-12-09 10:31:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rck2rb/second_attempt_now_i_hit_21_days/,"Second attempt, now I hit 21 days","I had begun smoking at college after I was amazed by it because of my baby tolerance 5.5 years ago. I had a bipolar girlfriend who was having me experience hell every day and had a terrorist propoganda court case filed against me because of my attendance in a holocaust commemoration.

Though I got acquitted in 2 years and managed to break up with her in 3 years, the habit of consuming daily didn't leave me.

I spent the last two years with conscience pain, looking down and judging myself about my weed consumption but always ended up with a joint at hand, fainting over the sound of my rationality.

As of June 2021; I wasn't enjoying it at all due to my everest tolerance and was financially bankrupted because I needed more and more to get a satisfactory highness. In June, I realized that I should not only approach this as a real addiction but also as a sickness.

I decided that I could spare the amount of money I spent for weed to an addiction psychiatrist. For the first time I managed to hit 7 days clean but was always ending up at friends' home where I could get an access to weed. 

After several breaks of 7 and 10 days I had an unfortunate relapse where I returned to daily use which lasted a month and had quitted seeing the doc.

Having hated myself because of my failiure, I realized that once I had stepped on the path of quitting, there was no return. I wasn't able to justify my weed consumption to myself anymore. Legends of ""thc has no physical addiction"" and ""I work and focus better with weed"" were no more convincing. So I decided to see the doc again.

Since that relapse, I have been clean for 21 days which is my record.

The lesson I learned is that relapses are nothing surprising. I had to show compassion for myself rather than judging and humiliating myself. 

Quitting weed begins with problematizing the use of it. There will be attempts and failiures for sure. But once you convince yourself that it is a process, success is there eventually.

Weed is like a long toxic relationship where each time you attempt to break up, you end up having crazy sex with your partner and hate yourself on the following day. Yes, once you stop seeing your partner your body will yearn for hım/her. Because you had spent so much time with him/her, there are countless objects and places that reminds you of your partner, where, in many cases you end up texting your dealer.

I now know that toxic relationships can end no matter how much time you spent there and what you had been through. Life is my life. Youth is my youth and I can fight to make it mine again. As I wouldn't want to dedicate all my time and resources to a toxic partner, I don't want to just live in order finance my weed consumption. Life is more than just accessing weed and survival.

I know I still need months to be able to surely say it's over. But I'm on the field, fighting to get my life and agency back.

And lastly, a very big thanks to the community in this subredit. All the experiences shared here made me feel that I am not aline, people all around the globe feel exatctly what I feel and quitting weed is really achiavelable.",13
2021-12-09 10:00:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rcjgcw/first_time_poster_long_time_lurker/,"First time poster, long time lurker","I've been a daily smoker for \~10 years, mostly smoking after work and on the weekends. I stopped smoking in January 2020 after a panic attack; I thought I was having a heart attack and called 911. From January through September 2020, I smoked twice with friends and genuinely hated it each time. It just didn't feel the same anymore. Then in October, I went to Venice Beach, California for a month of remote working. I had never been to a dispensary and I was curious what legal weed was like. What started as 2mg gummies after work on the way to the beach turned into smoking joints during and after work and all weekend again. It's been over a year since I went to California and I've gone back to smoking regularly in my free time and hating myself for it. 

A few months ago I started recording voice memos on my phone whenever I was feeling emotional. I almost never listened back to them though, just a good way to let things out. Then about 2 months ago I started seeing a therapist over zoom. After the first session, I realized I couldn't remember what we talked about or what my ""assignments"" were for the next week, so I decided to record our sessions using voice memos on my phone so I could listen back.  And even though I wasn't high during our sessions, listening back was surprising. 

During our sessions I felt my therapist was not really listening to me, that he was being very vague with his responses. Listening back later, he was actually asking genuine questions and rephrasing what I was saying so I could hear it back in the moment.  Re-listening to myself, I sounded like a scared little kid who couldn't articulate things. Sometimes he would ask me a question and I would get frustrated with my inability to think or recall or explain. I didn't recognize myself, and I was surprised at how different the recordings were to my memory of them. I started to hate on myself, but then remembered I'm listening to the weed-funk version of myself. When I took a few days off and had a session, I felt and sounded completely different. 

I'm sharing all this bc I'm amazed how much smoking affects me the next day. And now with a few days of no weed, I feel ""cleaner"".  I can think straight and explain myself and concentrate a bit more. And that's hopefully only going to get better day by day. I know from experience there will be hard days and there will be surprisingly emotional days, and that's ok. I tell myself that abstaining is going to the the hardest thing I've ever done, so when I get another day under my belt I can feel proud about it. Bc truthfully it is hard, really hard, and rewarding myself for clean days is important to me.  

I never thought I'd write in this thread, never thought I'd write this much in a post, but this community has been so helpful (even for a lurker like myself). For me, my focus for the next few weeks are to be out of the house as much as possible, avoid alcohol, and try to see friends whenever possible.

I’m now in my second week and my physical symptoms have gotten so much worse. I have had a headache for 5 days straight, I can’t focus at all at work, my joints hurt so bad, my muscles are achey. I have random bouts of nausea where I think I’m going to vom. It’s awful. 

I keep getting scared that I have COVID because I genuinely feel like I’ve been hit by a semi-truck, then I remember I’m going through cannabis withdrawals. I’m just surprised that it took 7-8 days for the physical symptoms to show up.

2021-12-09 07:44:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rcgwyn/giving_in_to_give_up/,Giving in to give up,"Hello wonderful community! 

Last night was my first night without weed in about 5 years. I have been a heavy user for around 10 years. And I’m ready to stop—no, it’s not because weed makes me feel bad or depressed or lazy, I’ve learned how to do my normal day-to-day shit while stoned and have been ok at it. It’s not that my life is falling apart. Actually, my life over the past 2 years had gotten significantly better—I found a partner, I’m deeply in love with her, and I’m holding a job and have a place to live. My reason for quitting is this: weed just is really stupid for most people. And let me tell you why.

As stated earlier, I’ve smoked everyday, multiple times a day,  for around 10 years. I’ve always had this complex about it—I “loved” weed but also saw it as “bad” based on the time, place, and situation of my upbringing. Pretty much people always told me weed was bad for me, and I “brushed it off” thinking they didn’t know what they were talking about. After all, it felt relaxing and (sometimes) fun. 

Around a month ago, I came to the realization that I wasn’t brushing this shit off, that a part of what fueled my addiction was this social construct that told me weed is bad for you. This is where shit may seem strange…Upon realizing this, I decided to give myself permission to smoke whenever I want, however much I want, with NO JUDGEMENT. I decided to view weed as a medicine not as a drug. After all, if weed was so great and so cool, I would surely enjoy smoking even more now that I gave myself full permission to smoke my balls off. 

About a month into this, I found out, a deep part of me didn’t want to smoke at all anymore. After 10 years, I was slowly realizing that I genuinely wanted to stop smoking, not based on what other people told me, but from my own experience with it. I realized that I genuinely wasn’t getting high and didn’t want to get high anymore. I realized getting high and chasing the high was old to me. I was allowing myself to partake whenever I wanted with no judgment and I realized that this was the first time my genuine desire to stop partaking has happened. Weed really isn’t that cool man, it’s not a miracle medicine for most people, and sometimes you have to remove what other people think about it to discover how YOU truly feel about it. 
Odds are you’re gonna find out for yourself that it’s not as great as you once thought…",7

I just want to share with you how I came to quit and seek some help to know what to expect! So i've started smoking sometime around september 2019 due to having a bad social circle and depression, where it helped my symptoms or more like hid them from me. It was mostly a j every evening. Fast forward to the pandemic and then everything went out of control where I started smoking heavily up to mostly being high as long as I'm up. It's worth noting that by that time I had started recovering from my depression and dealing with my problems, all while still toking. Now from around July 2021 to now i've drastically decreased my intake to mostly weekly with several breaks here and there but September 3rd I decided to quit for good after many attempts because i figured that even the reasons that I stsrted smoking for are no longer present, so what's the point of smoking now? It's making me spend money, demotivates me (i've been planning to learn languages and work on projects but right when I smoke all of that goes away), and I just miss the feeling of getting high by being passionate about a hobby or an activity where you get in the zone. The reason i found to be making my attempts to quit fail was that it was hard for me to imagine my life without weed in it, always saying to myself that i'm gonna smoke when i'm travelling, partying, having ""relaxing moments"", so i've made it really a part of my life. And just writing those right now made my heart race and made me feel anxious about letting it go. Even starting to imagine myself going for alternatives like supplements because it's just another type of high but I don't want my life to be revolved around a substance whatsoever. So how did you guys deal with this? And what can I do to help? This time i quit with the idea that I don't want it in my life anymore because i've lived a normal life without it and I can do it again, and I just want my old self back so I don't miss it anymore. And Thank you for all the help y'all ! Stay strong !",1

I’m excited to be back dreaming again and enjoy my subconscious soup of mental well-being being processed and downloaded connected somehow to my conscious mind. I felt like it was much more healing sleep than when I was smoking and using other substances to pacify and sedate myself. I’m a beautiful person and I can do many great things. I wish to bring love and understanding to my present moments and I know being sober and present in my awareness is the best way for me to do so. Raw garlic is also a good medicine and it has also helped me becuase it almost gets me a high when I eat it. It awakens me and protects me. Food is medicine eat up the food stuff.

Ready to quit now,"I'm 51M, successful business owner. I drank and smoked a lot of weed in high school, but have not used drugs or alcohol until I found Delta 8 last year.

I've been vaping around two 1gram cartridges each week for the past year.   

For awhile now, I've known that I have a problem with D8, but this is the first time I've actually admitted it/come to terms with it. Lately, I'm having trouble ""rationalizing"" it. I'm ready to be done with it and I'm glad I found this forum.

This past week, I went 3 days without D8 which I feel good about. I took a few puffs last night which eased the sickness and anxiety I've been feeling. Today, I'm feeling a little better. I'm going to try and go longer now and keep at this until I'm completely done with it. That's my strategy. I don't know if it's the best one, but it's a place to start.

I also wanted to share some background about why I got into D8 and if anyone can relate to my situation. I've had the most bizarre year of my life!

Last year, I got Covid which affected my mind badly somehow. That led to a Bipolar II diagnosis that needed some strong meds to resolve. I got into some very bizarre behaviors (money, sex, non stop talking, weird ideas) for about 3 months. In my state at the time, it seemed like Delta 8 was a great idea to help with my problem. It was legal, available, etc. It felt like a safety net and an escape. 

Unfortunately, it still feels that way. I've never really ""needed"" anything like this before.",8

I have to made a post since the beginning of my journey. I was struggling quite a bit during my first week of sobriety and this group really helped me double down. I am proud to say that I am nearing the 2 month mark. With the amount I was smoking before, this is a huge deal for me. I'd like to thank all the strangers that encouraged me during my low points and offer an ear (and whatever advice I can) to whoever needs it.

 These two months have been a bit difficult. Still having some relationship issues that I am working through. Not having weed (or dabs) to fall back on to numb it all has been a bit trying at times, but it has also made me realize that there are other aspects of myself that I need to work on.

Some days I really want to risk it all and see how high I could get now that I've been clean for so long. But I usually come back here, read a few posts and realize I would probably fall back into the daily smoker that I was for so long.

So again, thank you to this community. We are not alone. You guys are awesome.",1

Working conditions are shit. Shitty bosses, constant overtime, minimum wage which isnot nearly enough to survive. I’m lucky to have parents that help, but I feel so guilty sucking up all their money after I sucked up so much of it to get a degree that ultimately did not help me at all. I’m terrified of the ever present pandemic, the hospitals near us are so overwhelmed people are reportedly just lying in makeshift beds in the hallways. My mom has cancer and frequently does chemo despite working full time in a stressful environment. My dad is on the verge of dementia. My sister who means the most to me, is incredibly smart - getting into an Ivy League school with a scholarship is suicidal and in and out of psychwards. My other sister is with a borderline abusive partner and I haven’t seen her since before the pandemic. I was offered this nice side teaching gig which would really help on the bills - but all the fees involved would bankrupt me so I don’t know if I’ll even be able to take it. I know how lucky I am, I’m very lucky to have the family I do and the skills I do and to be who I am - and yet right now it doesn’t do anything for me. And everywhere I look I see people suffering even more than me, significantly more than me. That’s the city of LA baby, god bless the USA. Jesus Christ like why wouldn’t I smoke I live in a hell with small glimpses of a heaven i may never get. Those small glimpses come when I don’t have anything to do, and can just sit outside. However, since I’ve been sober I am only ever anxious in those times worrying about everything above. At least with weed I felt I was happier and could actually live, not stuck on things ultimately outside of my control.

Anyways rant over end scene. Just not sure if quitting actually was a good decision, given my rapidly deteriorating mental health.",8

Reading your stories has helped to give me the confidence to make the plunge and become who I want to be. A week ago I did not believe that I could ever be free of the plant I loved but now that couldn’t be less true and I am happy and excited to begin my journey of self rediscovery. I intend to post here somewhat regularly to contribute to the community and hopefully I can provide some support and inspiration as you have to me. I wanted to start with a bit of background and then hopefully make some future posts updating my journey. 

The timeline goes:

2008 started smoking socially 

2009- 2013 smoking every day with friends and soon all day every day on my own and with others, smoking as much as I could afford/was put in front of me until I cut ties with everyone around me. I was stealing, taking other drugs and in a cycle of complete self destruction. I  started working in mental health and finally saw my way out and returned to education. 

2013 relapsed for 6 months following relationship breakdown 

2013-2015 sober then a few occasions socially which led to mini binges 

2016-2018 every night  

2018-2019 9 months sober back with parents 

2019- Feb 2021 herb vaping every day after work / all day weekends at home

Feb 2021 to June 2021 4 months sober to persevere a relationship 

June 2021 to Dec 2021 smoking all day  every day peaking at 3.5g a day from September onwards after relationship ended due to the inevitable relapse 

And here we are, day 7 of this next chapter in my story, and feeling more positive and excited for this than ever before. I have spent huge swathes of my life in the haze we know too well. I have made lists as long as my arm with reasons to quit (one for another post) and despised the perpetual decisions to grt high, but I have thus far failed to quit or moderate in the long term.

So what is different this time around? 

This time around, for the first time, I am quitting for me and me alone; I am not under any illusions that moderation will ever be an option for me; I have reforged important relationships and created a support network; I am working to understand my story and my psychology and planning for the future; i have finally let go of the shame of smoking and at last replaced it with love; i am genuinely looking forward to reaching my potential; I believe in my ability to succeed, to be secure and to finally live a happy life. I deserve a happy life. Finally, this time around I am posting here, to you all, who understand why I am here. I’m pushing through the familiar withdrawal nice and slowly, meditating every day and setting myself some small goals while pouring love back into myself. 

This is the time that I succeed.",7

Reminding myself tonight, all the reasons I wanted to quit. Reminding myself what it feels like to be high and thinking about how you don’t want to live that way any more. GOT to remind myself of that feeling when I feel like I’m quitting for no reason. It’s like all the reasons to quit are non existent when you start justifying smoking again.

Every other week I’d feel like it wasn’t worth it, because I’d be thinking about when I’d get to smoke next all the time. I’ve taken a few drags here and there, slipped up once too. But I will consider it progress because it’s a big change. 

First month: major impulse control issues. I ate a lot more than normal, switched to running like my life depended on it. Got into a relationship though, with someone I want to be more like. He hates pot btw 😒/😌 

Second month: got injured so had to stop running. Spent a lot of money on trivial things, because to my mind it was justified. Drank more too. Smoked up once on my birthday, it was fun for a treat but I was a lot more anxious than I remember being on pot. 

Third month: started getting really restless at my job. Impulsively smoked on my own once, again it was different than I remembered but still fun. Watched a lot of new content online. Cut myself off of takeout because I’d started feeling low energy because of it. 

Fourth month: started hating my job, got really anxious about my career. Smoked a lot of cigarettes, but pot only once (socially). Cribbed about my career and social life to my boyfriend a lot, until I got so sick of it I had to do something. Applied to a lot of places for a change of pace. 

Going on month five: giving my month’s notice soon. Got an offer for a higher position, with a higher pay in a different city. I don’t even know how. Relationship going scarily well. Probably because I have time to talk to him everyday (had previously sabotaged a different relationship because of the ridiculous amount of “me” time I needed I.e. getting stoned on my own). I’m going outside more these days, really need that too. Looking forward to the big move. 

Suddenly dawned on me just now that all of this would be impossible without having quit. I quit because I was scared I couldn’t do it, that it had been too many years of depending on it. I had no idea how comfortable I had gotten. Or that being uncomfortable is challenging and frustrating and confusing but oh, so rewarding. Or that at some point I’ll stop thinking about getting stoned and start thinking about what makes me want to get stoned in the first place.",32

I usually follow a system when I quit where I go nicotine first, using weed as something to kind of counteract the nicotine withdrawal. Then after a week or two I stop with weed. This time was the same, but today, my first day weed free, has been the worst I’ve ever experienced. I’ve spent today in an unending rage and I truly feel dead. Like I said, I’ve done this before but I’ve never felt this bad day 1. Which sucks because while I was off nicotine I was reading every day, meditating, practicing gratitude, but today I feel no desire to do anything like that.

* I got irritable and REAL annoyed at stupid stuff (like, wind. leaves on the sidewalk. a loud noise.)
* got low and depressed
* the really high energy I had went away and my motivation felt drained
* the brain fog returned
* the anxiety and dread about going to work returned

It honestly felt like I was experiencing many of the bad symptoms of smoking again but...without smoking. I felt really discouraged. It was like ""why bother quitting if quitting doesn't solve all my problems.""

I'm just trying to take it a day at a time.

Reading anecdotes and stories about how other people are affected helps.

Going out for long walks help. (Actually one reason why I feel worse this week compared to last week could be because I exercised less this week.)

Remembering my # streak, not wanting to start from day 1, not wanting to admit that I relapsed, and wanting to hit a higher number of days has helped. It would be shitty to relapse on day 11, right? Might as well try for two full weeks. Once I hit 14 days, then I'll want to hit 15. Keep slowly moving that benchmark. Don't think about being sober for a full month. But let the days add up.

When I have felt tempted, ""postponing"" the decision helps. I've thought about it a few times before bed. I tell myself to go to the bedroom, to lie down in bed, to at least take steps towards sleep. To delay my decision about smoking to the next day. If I REALLY can't sleep then maybe...but inevitably once I'm in the bedroom and chilling, I do get sleepy, and I fall asleep fine. And then I wake up the next morning with no desire to smoke.

Also giving myself permission to reward myself with other pleasurable things instead of being a taskmaster when I already don't feel well. Bad day? Permission to watch a couple episodes of a show that makes me laugh. I'm not wasting time. I'm resting. I'm giving my body a chance to heal, to reset.",7

Any tips/words or encouragement would be appreciated!,"Hi everyone I’m military veteran that suffers from PTSD, anxiety, and other mental health issues.  Marijuana calms my mind, simulates my appetite, and helps me sleep at night.  Overall it’s been a lifesaver, and I’ve consumed 10+ times a day for over a decade.  

I live in Nevada, a medical & recreational state.  Most employers no longer test for marijuana since it’s legal here, and I never though my consumption would be an issue.  Unfortunately the non profit I want to work at receives federal funding and they have a “zero tolerance” policy for all drugs, including marijuana. I was caught off guard by this and decided to be honest during my interview yesterday.  The employer agreed to give me some time to get clean before scheduling the drug test.  I expect my drug test to take place in the next 10-12 days. Even if I stay sober until then, there’s no guarantee I will pass my test since I have a history of heavy use. 

This is my first marijuana abstinence attempt and I’m pretty nervous about it.  I feel sobriety will be extra hard since I don’t *want* to change my smoking habits, it’s being forced on me for employment reasons.  I haven’t smoked since bedtime last night so I’m about 12 hours sober.  I’m already incredibly irritable and I don’t know how I’m going to last 1-2 weeks without my marijuana meds.

By the time I was 13 I was smoking daily, consuming pot the way most burnouts do, every day all day. This continued for the last 15 years until I got a rude awakening. 
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year. Nobody in my family has it and I have a very common gene mutation that only makes me slightly more susceptible to schizophrenia than the average bear. 
There is no question that smoking all throughout my adolescence contributed to my development of schizophrenia, and it’s not something I’d wish on my worst enemy. This isn’t meant to be fear mongering, but a reminder that these things do happen and you can’t do anything about it until it’s too late. If you’re under 25 and still smoking I’d urge you to quit while you’re ahead. You don’t want to be 28 and going back to college for the third time. You don’t want to grow up to find you didn’t develop any real skills. 
Your brain is still developing and there is some evidence that marijuana interferes with crucial synaptic pruning that takes place as you approach adulthood. If I had one wish in life it would be to go back to high school and smack the joint out of my hands, even call the cops on myself. If you find yourself smoking on the daily- you’re covering up a much deeper issue that you need therapy or even medication for. 
I get that kids experiment, but smoking in your room alone is not experimentation at some point, it’s addiction. 
Pot is a physical and mental addiction. Like any substance you put in your body you are effecting your brain by upregulating and down regulating receptors, including CB receptors. 
Don’t kid yourself into thinking it’s a harmless habit- and all those kids you smoke with? They won’t stick around as friends. As soon as you quit you’ll find you have nothing in common, and that’s it’s own shitty realization. 
My heart goes out to those of you younguns who might be fortunate enough to be scrolling through leaves already. 
Quit while your ahead. Adult you will thank you for it.

“Those who had smoked marijuana at least once were more than twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those who had never smoked pot. The heaviest users (who said they used marijuana more than 50 times) were six times as likely to develop schizophrenia as the non smokers”-Harvard Health

In 1995, 2% of schizophrenia diagnoses in the country were associated with cannabis use disorder. In 2000, it increased to around 4%. Since 2010, that figure increased to 8%, the study found.

""I think it is highly important to use both our study and other studies to highlight and emphasize that cannabis use is not harmless,"" said Carsten Hjorthøj, an associate professor at the Copenhagen Research Center for Mental Health and an author of the study published in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry,

Many textbooks in psychiatry state that the incidence... of schizophrenia is constant over time and independent of geographical location,"" Hjorthøj said.

""And this has often been used as an argument against the hypothesis that cannabis could cause schizophrenia,"" he added. ""However, it turns out that there is very little research that would support this notion.""

Legalization of marijuana, both for medical and recreational use, continues to spread across the globe even as the possible health risks (or benefits) are not fully known. Case in point, according to new research, people who use cannabis daily, as well as those who use high-potency weed, may be three times more likely to develop psychotic disorder than never-users.",238

A very long damn time.  I've known for a while that I needed to put this habit behind me.  I'd become numb to all forms of emotional connections and really any joy in life itself.  Maybe it wouldn't have gotten to that point if I had the ability to exercise some restraint and moderation, but I finally had to face the reality that wasn't going to happen.  A few weeks ago I ceremoniously packed my last bowl and woke the next morning with no stash, nothing even to scrape.  The first few days were quite difficult, I absolutely didn't know what to do with myself.  Everything was a trigger, because I smoked after everything I did.  Now?  It's not so bad.  I had some stomach issues the first week.  The dreams are nuts, but I sort of look forward to them.  And I feel more like a real man.  I look people in the eye now.  I'm nowhere near as indecisive or concerned at how I'm seen by others.  I'm sharper in every way.  That sense of anxiety that makes me feel like I need to rush through whatever it is that I'm doing just isn't there anymore.  Even though my mind was mush, I exercised somewhat regularly, but I was just trying to get through it, so I could 'reward' myself by adding another layer of fog.  And yes, a lot of repressed memories have reappeared, but they were there all the time and I was being a coward trying to hide from them rather than spent just a little while and finding some forgiveness that put most of them to bed.  Some forgiveness was for others and some was forgiving myself.  I feel significantly more worth and actually feel like I have some value now.  My marriage fell apart years ago and until now I never felt I had anything to offer anyone.  Now I find myself being a bit selective.  Life isn't easy, but it's like the difference between driving at night in the rain and then driving during the day with clear skies.  I guess I'm posting this to let others that are like me know that you can end this if you want.  The 'loss' you might think you'll experience is all in your mind, and if you're breathing right now then you can do this.",39
2021-12-08 09:49:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rbsytm/smoked_weed_last_night/,Smoked weed last night,"I took a good few hits off a blunt last night my friend was smoking. I already knew that day I wanted to smoke, it wasn't cravings of being around him or going to the dispensary for him that did it. It was premeditated.

It was day 10 of quitting, the reason I quit being a major panic attack the last time I smoked. The blunt kicked in and it was great for the first 20-30 minutes, but not as great as i had remembered. But then out of nowhere I could feel the panic start to grip me. I made an excuse to go outside and try to calm down, thinking the cold would do it. I had the same auditory hallucination I did the last time, that gripping existential fear, my heart rate was way above resting, even my best friends positive presence couldn't calm me down. 

I don't regret this experience though, as I learned something. These panic attacks really and truly are my body telling me to quit weed. Whenever I tried making excuses like maybe I smoked too much or maybe I'll smoke again one day or anything like that, the panic started to come back... but whenever I was firm in ""I'm never smoking weed again"" I was able to manage it. Just like the last time I still have a lot of lingering anxiety the next day, but that will pass just like the last time. 

The reason I feel this was a good experience was that now I know, weed just isn't in the cards for me anymore. I'd noticed so many positive changes over my 10 days of sobriety, that blunt solidified everything I had told myself about why I'm quitting. Made it even more of something I know I need to do. Do I regret smoking? Yes. But if I didn't smoke do I think I'd smoke another time? Yes. I got rid of all the what ifs, I just have to accept that I'll never smoke weed again. Gone are the thoughts of developing a healthy relationship with weed one day. 

I still believe in weed, as it is good for a lot of different things for a lot of different people and even practical uses. But I've always said that weed isn't for everybody and it isn't for everybody for every part of their life. I had 2.5 years where weed fit my life, almost took it over a bit. But now I feel like we're turning a new chapter. And as bitter as it it to have a character I loved in the book die, it only is going to fuel future development, and make room for new character introductions like my new gym membership.

The thing is I replaced weed with D8 carts which are a million times worse as I used to be a cigarette smoker, and now you can find these literally anywhere.I haven’t gotten high since May, so at this point it’s the addiction of “scoring the weed”, and since d8 carts are now found everywhere, I find it nearly impossible . But so are cigarettes, and I managed to quit those. I have the MA app downloaded, I have downloaded grounded, but that doesn’t seem to help and I can’t get to actually go to an MA meeting.

My main reasons to stop is : 


- Having freedom of how I organise my evening
- Having more time for progressing in my life 
- Losing some of my social anxiety
- Getting back pleasure from doing simple things with people
- Stopping to destroy my lungs

I hear from many people that it has gotten a lot easier to get their shit together and work towards their goals after quitting.

But for me as an future programmer who is learning all by his own, it just got worse since I quit.

Somehow I don't have the drive and the focus to keep programming, whereas when i was smoking I just hit the bong and sat down in front of my pc and tried to code until I faced some error. Then I hit the bong again and kept going. But now as soon as I hit a roadblock... I just start procrastinating like a piece of shit, or can't even find the drive to start.

I tell myself that I just have to change my habits now... But it feels so much harder right now... 6 years of heavy smoking left it's traces I guess... Just hit the 2 months weed free mark... How long will it take until my brain will come back to normal?

Or do you have any Tipps on how to tackle this bad behavior? My brain tells me to smoke and then I will be able to sit in front of my desk all day long... But I know that this can't be the answer, and I want to achieve my goals without weed. 

my hope is to become more productive than I've ever been with weed, I wanted to unleash my full potential to become a good programmer, but I still can't see any huge benefits in that regard  after 2 months... In fact it just has got harder since my thoughts and doubts are more present at the moment

My 2022 goal is to go a whole year without weed. About 2 years ago, I went 8 months sober, then met my girlfriend and smoked with her one night while on a date.

I originally decided to quit as my husband and I were trying for a baby. After a month and being not pregnant I decided to carry on smoking. No harm as I wasn't pregnant yet right?! 

Well I found out I was pregnant at the end of October so I instantly stopped (I was 3 weeks pregnant when I found out & stopped) the baby is doing well thank god.

I've had odd days where I really wanted to smoke but overall it's been relatively easy. 

Last night we were watching TV and I suggested the new tiger king. Hubby said no, he'd rather watch that when we're high as it's more entertaining (true) so I said I'd order some for him as he doesn't have to quit like I do. (He has I think? Unless he's had some without me knowing)

After a back and forth discussion I talked myself out of it as fast as I talked myself into it. I realised I've got self control right now as we don't have any weed and because I know I can't potentially put any harm on my baby. I'd never forgive myself if anything went wrong. If I had weed in the house, even if my husband didn't smoke it around me (which he assured me he wouldn't) I'd go back to how I was before I stopped. An absolute wreck searching for any scrap I could find to smoke and zero control.

I'm scared in 7 months time once the baby's here I'll fall back into my old ways. I don't want to go back. I'm a better mum to my 7 year old now. I want to stay this way for both my kids. I always justified my smoking like a mum who got home and drank a glass of wine. 

Just needed a place to share this as quite frankly I'm proud that I talked myself out of it and I'm also a little bit ashamed that I even considered smoking weed again whilst I'm pregnant. This is my first pregnancy since my traumatic miscarriage a few years ago. What was I even thinking last night?!",5

Tomorrow will mark my 3 week streak of not smoking. I know that I have made the best decision for myself to stop. I struggle with anxiety and depression and was abusing weed. I was taking about 5-10 dabs a day. Dabbing before work, before any task, before any social event (that I would still attend because I became so paranoid towards the end I didn’t want to do anything but stay at home) I lost so many of my friends because of this terrible habit and overall just smoked my life away for the last 8 years. My only issue is my boyfriend of 5 years who I live with is still consuming and I’m really struggling with that. In fact weed is what brought us together. Over the last year or two I would say he has approached me several times saying he would like to quit, but we never made any action to do so. Well I came across this page and found some posts that made me realize how addicted I was and how horrible my life had become. I told him I thought it was ruining our lives. He agreed because like I said he had approached me many times agreeing that our consumption was out of hand. So we both stopped for a whole week together. As bad as the first week was from withdrawals, I felt closer and more connected to him than I have in our whole 5 year relationship, I felt like we were both trying to really get our lives together and be better as individuals and as a couple.

At the end of the first week, his friend was coming in to town who is also a heavy user. He was very nervous about this as he knew he was going to be tempted to smoke. We discussed that he would smoke that weekend with him and then we would go back to being sober as soon as he left. I was completely fine with this I agreed. It wasn’t until his friend got here that I realized how naive I was for thinking that I could be around weed and be totally okay. I felt like a psycho I was so jealous of my boyfriend and honestly resented him for doing it even though I had agreed to him doing it! I avoided him the whole weekend and was honestly such a bitch. We talked about it and he was very understanding and he went back to being sober. 

Well he got sick this last weekend and said he wanted to smoke so he could relax. I told him If that’s what he wanted to do than he should. I didn’t want to control him. Instantly when he got home I was so annoyed and so turned off I couldn’t even be around him. I hated that I was acting this way. I wanted to be okay with him smoking but I just can’t get over the resentment. So I broke down and told him that I needed to break up with him because I just couldn’t handle being around the weed anymore and realized that as much as I want to be okay with him consuming I just am not. I told him I don’t think that he should have  to stop if he doesn’t want to. He flipped out and said that buying the cartridge and pen was a stupid idea that he loved me more than weed, He said he regretted it as soon as he did it and that he was done again. I of course believed this and agreed to stay. In my gut I knew he was still smoking.. yesterday he came home and he must of forgot to put eye drops in because it was clear he was high I was very annoyed, but wanted to test him and see if he would come clean.  Nothing. 

This morning is my birthday and he kissed me good bye and it woke me up. I pretended to sleep and saw the pen in his hand and watched him go into the bathroom to hit it before going to work. I am devastated. I’m not sure what to do. I feel crazy for asking him to stop, but it’s the lying that has me even more upset than the smoking I’m not even sure I’m just pissed.

I know this is very long and if you’ve read through it I appreciate it. Any comments of encouragement or advice would be great! I’m really struggling and feel very alone. Please pray for me that I don’t relapse today. Smoking all this away would be an easy fix but that’s not what I’m going for anymore.",5

Family, friends, strangers indirectly or directly disrespect me sometimes. I usually didn’t see this, and when I did it wasn’t worth the fight to me.

About a year ago my life started to slowly crumble away from me. My partner and I were growing apart and eventually I started to ""responsibly"" eat edibles from time to time. She knew, but made it very obvious that she was against it. We broke up in August for a number of reasons but our disagreement on weed was in the background. For four years I thought I'd spend my life with her, but now she is gone.   


The last few months have been rough. Between the break up, finding a new place, moving out and joining a new team at work I've been in this constant state of activity but, every night I find time to smoke. The negative side effects are so obvious. I've got a lack of motivation in work and a desire to be at home stoned. I'm spending more than I make, my relationships are not growing and most worryingly of all I can feel my memory, creativity and everything else starting to fade. I can feel it starting to become the centre of my attention again. Its sad.   


I'm writing this now because I need to redouble my efforts to quit and I remember journaling with this community being such a positive experience. I know there'll probably be more relapses in the future, but I have to start trying now ... pushing my quit date back and back and back is only fooling myself.",2

I've been smoking cigarettes and pot for 3 years now (started just before I turned 19) and it's been heavy on-and-off use with periods of time where I'll be stoned everyday for anywhere inbetween a couple of days to a few months. Self-medication would be the biggest overall reason I use as I struggle with demands at work and I tend to get bored, overthink, get depressed and try to escape reality from time to time. 

Most of my friends, even family, use pot and it's difficult to establish boundaries or say no whenever the opportunity arises for a smoke. I've made several attempts to quit and read Allen Carr's 'Easyway' to quit smoking to rid myself of cigarettes which worked for a short while until I use again to escape what's happening in my life or because I don't have anything better to do. 

These days, I find that my memory and focus is fading big time and I'm very concerned for how it has affected my brain ,decision making and overall quality of life. I'll just stay inside, lock myself away and smoke bowls for as long as I can. I've stopped eating, showering regularly and I don't know now what I want for my life or how to move forward. I have goals and I want to meet people and girls, explore what the world is 

Pot has been a catalyst in relationships breaking down, criminal activity and 'scoring' off many friends with no compensation in return. It's as though I get this little niggle in my head as I'm smoking that doesn't want me to come down off the high and wants me to smoke as much as possible. I hope that I can one day smoke in moderation or at public events, I know I cannot have it in my home and around me personally because it will lead back into locking myself away and wasting my time and life. 

Just an initial post, look forward to hanging around,

Best wishes.

I’ve smoked almost every day for 8 years. Every time i try to quit i just have a bad time. I know weed is bad for me, it takes more than 80% of my money, but I'm still buying and smoking again because of the side effects i get when not smoking. I’m 23 years old and in last 8 years, I’ve moved 3 countries in these 3 years, a lot of aspects of my life changed, but weed was always a constant. So when i take it out, i stop enjoying literally everything. I can’t enjoy food, i lose appetite to the point i don't want to eat anything for 3 days. I can’t watch movies and get bored after 5 minutes maximum, i can’t enjoy videogames, i can’t enjoy sex, can't enjoy music. All of those activities in my head trigger the need for a joint. I also feel depressed like hell when I'm not high, and getting any sort help from a doctor is not an option for me in the country I live in right now. Another thing i have that I've not been able to explain to anyone irl is a physical feeling I have in my chest when i need a smoke. Whenever i crave a joint, i have an uncomfortable feeling in my throat and lungs. That feeling goes away with the first puff of a joint. When sober, i also can’t sleep without it unless i take a shitload of appropriate medicine every night, either that or i pass out from exhaustion. One more annoying thing is my hands start getting sweaty after 2 days of not smoking, and they are constantly dripping wet until i smoke again. I’ve been reading this subreddit and many others, and none offer legit advice in terms of how to enjoy things when your dopamine levels are low. In half of my previous attempts to quit I've tried to substitute it with other things, it didn't work. What most of the people advice on this topic online is quitting cold turkey and waiting for symptoms to disappear. Now the last time I've quit i lasted 3 months, and i maybe felt 10% better, all the drawbacks and the apathy was still there, so that didn't last. I want to quit cold turkey again, but i need your advices. Thanks in advance.",6

I put all my pot stuff in a bag and gave it to my wife to hide until I could give it to a friend.  I woke up this morning, and the bag was still in the kitchen, so I grabbed the vape and hit it again. (Great start bud. NOT!) I've now been at work all day without the vape, which I usually hit throughout the day.  I have been so anxious about going home and not having my pen or anything.  I've asked my wife to make sure the bag is gone,  but man, I'm not looking forward to my first night. Wish me luck and a little shut eye tonight.

While I’m not in a constant state of panic, it’s still hard to function from the time I wake up (6:30am) until around 4pm and then it gets easier until bedtime (10pm). I am exhausted, anxious, and just jittery. I have developed a headache that seems to come and go, but it’s manageable.

My appetite has improved, still a little hard to eat though. I’ve started trying to work out 15-30 minutes a day, it helps for a bit. I’m guzzling water and have had no caffeine.

I have used every withdrawal and breakdown to fuel myself that I never want to come back to this EVER. 

I have come to terms that I cannot smoke in moderation, this has to be the end of my relationship with smoking.

2021-12-07 18:15:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rbcbud/im_done_this_time_for_good/,"I’m done, this time for good.","Hi everyone, thought I’d share my story since others stories have really helped me stay sane through withdrawals and helped me take a better objective look at my addiction over the last 2.5 years. I started smoking around November-December of 2019 and before I knew what happened I was high all day every day for a large part of the last couple years of my life. I just loved being high. It made me feel better mentally, made music sound better, food taste better and made mundane boring tasks less so. My ex roommate got me into it, assuring me that he had smoked for over a decade and was fine, it’s a harmless substance and it’s so much better for you than alcohol and can even have medicinal benefits too! I thought this stuff is amazing, life changing even and there’s no downsides? Why not just stay high all the time like my buddy? Only now I realize looking back that cannot be further from the truth. 

When I started my trusty bowl was my best friend but the more I smoked the more weed it took and the more money I was spending to stay high all day, which led me to concentrates. I always had a dab pen on me at work and really wherever I went and spent the nights coughing till my head was pounding and lungs hurt from dabs and shatter. It wasn’t long before my tolerance was so astronomical that there wasn’t bud on the market that could even get me buzzed and I realized that I had to take a tolerance break if I wanted to get high like I used to. 

I stopped for about 2 months in may or April of this year and upon starting again something was a little different, I felt this nagging, bubbling sense of anxiety every time I’d toke up, but at least I could get high again from bud! It wasn’t long until I decided to put it down again. My tolerance had went way back up again, so much faster than I had anticipated and almost like a scale with my tolerance going up my mental health went down. Anxiety, paranoia, depersonalization and irrational intrusive thoughts had started to consume me every time I’d light up and follow me long after the high was gone. I felt like I was watching my life fly by in third person, it had to stop. I quit for about 5 months and those 5 months were without a doubt the clearest period of my life in the last two years, and really the only solid block of memory I have from then. I missed weed, but I felt being sober was worth it so I stayed on track. Unfortunately about a month ago I relapsed and started smoking again. I told myself I could control it now I had a sober perspective but almost instantly I was back to all day every day, bud for the nights and d8 for the days. The weekend before last I smoked with my old ex roommate for the first time in over six months, he was so happy to have his smoking buddy back and so was I, but that night weed really turned on me. It was by far the closest I had ever come to either a panic attack or psychosis and on the drive back home I vowed that I had to stop, this time for good. 

The withdrawals have been hellish, so much more than the first two times but I’ve held strong. Took a full week for my appetite to come back and intrusive thoughts to subside but 7 days later I’m feeling much better. I’ve spent these last 7 days ruminating on my life since I started smoking, and I’ve realized how little of the last 2.5 years that I actually remember. I took a ring I bought my girlfriend a couple years ago to get fixed and they asked me what type of metal it was only to realize I don’t remember even giving it to her. How much it cost, where I bought it, what occasion I gave it to her for, nothing. There’s just a two year gap where I only remember the biggest events and that wake up call reinforced my commitment to end this shitty addiction and never look back.  This community has helped me a lot and has been an oasis of sobriety from the stoner community preaching only about the positives of weed and I can only hope this post can help someone else out there struggling like me. Stay strong guys we got this 💪",3

Am off weed for 6 months or so. Just wanted to share my thought on the phenomenon ‘weed holds you back’. This is correct, viewing from my experience. I achieved more these 6 months than what I achieved the 4 years of daily weed inhaling. Just to sum up a couple of things: am partaking in local politics and participating with the elections next year, focussed on working out again (it was on and off during the 4 years), saved up an amount of money that I never had in one time, partaking in the student council, more clear mind and am happier. The politics stuff would never took place if I still smoked. 

Advice for the people quitting: weed usage maintains because of loneliness or having friends who smoke too. Cut them out when quitting and find something to keep you busy: like I have the gym and politics now. I am surrounded with very different people, the friends who I used to smoke with (they still do) are swapped for a bit older people in the politics. They open a door to a new world you never knew existed because weed keeps you in one chapter of your book.

This isn't my first attempt, and each time I had the same feeling. I want too so bad to just divorce myself from the thought of smoking weed, but I just don't know how to willfully do it. I want too put my heart into quitting, but I just don't know what that means. I feel like there is this other side of me that won't let me accept that I will not smoke anymore.

Dear Theonewithsprinkles' Real Name,

Tomorrow you're not going to smoke weed. Your brain is going to be really pissed off at you and try to make you miserable. It will come up with all sorts of excuses and try to trick you into thinking that smoking weed is a good idea. IT IS NOT. 

Be nice to your wife. Spend time with your child. Exercise. Meditate. Don't be a bitchy asshole.

You've done this before, you know this is WORTH IT and you're so much better off without weed. It is taking away more than it could ever give you.

My Journey Begins Here.,"I found this group and was inspired by the other stories, and wanted to contribute my own; not only for accountability but to reflect on the reason I am doing this, and hopefully it will inspire others to do the same. 

I have been smoking almost every night for a little over two years now, a drug I said I would never do. I met a friend in college who smoked every night, and we became best friends. Naturally, I began to partake with him. At first it was only when we were together so I did not see a problem with it. I smoked once or twice a week and was able to get all my assignments in on time and get decent grades on my exams. Then I graduated a year earlier than him, and moved to a new state to start my career as a Network Engineer where I knew no-one. 

Every night since I moved away I smoked weed. At first it wasn't a lot of weed, but it was my way to escape from the reality that I was alone with no friends and some relatives about 30 minutes away (which was an absolute blessing). I was able to always stay productive and clear my list of To-Dos before I started smoking for the evening, typically between 8-10 pm. 

2 Years later: My life is more exciting. I have a wonderful girlfriend who I met out of what you can call ""fate"". I have a great network of new friends, I moved into a larger city and I have a new job where I got a great pay raise. I am blessed, and have nothing to complain about. Because I was always able to stay productive and get my tasks done before smoking weed, I told myself it was fine to keep doing it. I mean I enjoyed it and it wasn't really ""holding"" me back. 

That's where I was wrong and that's why I am writing this. Looking at my life from the outside it looks great; as I said I am not complaining at all where I am now. It's when I look at myself from the inside I am truly torn apart. 

* I am one big ball of anxiety. Every time I leave an interaction with my girlfriend or friends I feel I ruined the relationship. 
* I have trouble with my attention span. 
* I have trouble carrying conversations.
* I get easily aggravated on the nights I don't smoke (like when I am with someone else).
* I am addicted. I have never been able to stop myself from smoking when I had the opportunity. 
* I am getting myself less and less out of my comfort zone. I can't remember what it's like being bored and looking for something to do. 
* When I am out late with friends, the only thing that is on my mind is going home to smoke. 
* When one thing goes wrong at work that is all I think about until I smoke. 
* My girlfriend doesn't know I smoke every night when I am not with her.

***Here is how I am going to motivate myself to change:*** 

* Set a goal: I am going to run every day (even if I have to force myself to) to train for a half marathon. 
* I am going to throw away all my weed smoking equipment. 
* I am going to fill the time I used to smoke with productive and rewarding activities. 
* I am going to try and meditate once a day. 
* I am going to focus on loving myself, and getting rid of the imposter syndrome I feel during work as well as during life. I read somewhere that once you really start to love yourself, that love will naturally pour out to those around you. 
* I will post here once a week, at this time, for accountability. 
* I am going to tell my best friend from college that I am going to quit. Weirdly, this feels like it's going to be the hardest one.

I figured it’d be perfect right now because I’m about to go somewhere for a month where if I don’t bring anything I won’t have anything. I never smoked until I was 18 (24 now) but had a roommate who’s definitely addicted and got me into bad habits by coming in every time she smoked to ask me to (not her fault, I should have said no but I went from every few weeks to every day quickly). 
Current issue is I’m going to my bfs house for a few days (unavoidable) and he smokes. Right now I have nothing around me but I’m worried I’ll slip up if it’s available and I’m drinking. He in no way pressures me but I’m still worried. Im thinking of asking him to literally mock me and make fun of my lack of control if I go to smoke (he never would unless I ask). Would that be too far or weird? 

TLDR: bf smokes, I’m quitting, might ask him to make fun of me verging on mean if I start rationalizing/go to smoke",1

That makes 2 decent sleeps in a row.  I added extra a sleep helper, cut back tv, stopped drinking soda after dinner and added an extra walk. I also started taking my anxiety medication that I was supposed to be on anyway. So I guess I'm just starting to take care of myself. 

Now for what is bugging me. I went to my doctor for a follow up yesterday. Once again I laid out everything like an open book for him. I told him about my struggles, my issues, and my concerns. He gave me a funny look and just said he was not against pot and brushed me off. I know, get a new doctor. But right now it isn't easy to find a decent place to go. I've also noticed that in my chart he has always had me as drug free even though I know I've popped for weed since I've been there and I've told him! 

Regardless I feel confident that I can do this.",2

I started smoking a few years ago to cope with some shit. It helped for a while (I miss those days lol), but now it feels like the only thing I care about SO MUCH of the time. If I'm dry, I will move mountains to get some. If I'm high, I can't even get up to lock the door, even when seeing it unlocked gives me hella anxiety. Idk. I don't like where my motivation for things are. I feel like weed is the only effective use of my time, but also produce nothing, not even good thoughts, while high. I just know that I once did.. right? When? Idk.

Well, my therapist wants me to try a dry week. I've gone that long before, but not really by choice. I'm thinking I want to try longer. But I also smoked yesterday when she suggested it.. I'm a mess. I'm scared. I don't want to give up on casual week smoking, but idk if I'll ever be able to be that way with it. I don't want to lose my only crutch, I'm still dealing with with the same heavy shit, but weed's hurting more than it's helping, isn't it? Why does this feel like a break up?

Anyway, I'm sober today and dry. Hopefully tomorrow can be Day 2. One day at a time. I can't give it up any other way. I'm still not sure I can give it up at all. But I want to try. I don't want my 10 year old to be 15 and I realize I missed her whole childhood. I'm sure she misses me sober. I know I do.

Just passing by to say that yesterday I completed 3 months off weed and other drugs and that I feel amazing! It's wonderful to have my life back, to be able to be more productive and to think clearly, to read books and understand what I'm reading again, to find joy in things without having to use a substance for that. To feel difficult feelings and understand I don't have to numb them and that if I accept them they usually pass pretty fast.

I guess that if I search for downsides of sobriety I'll be able to find those as well, but I'm done searching for them after fighting to get sober for more than a decade, with tons of relapses. Fear and doubt would get me in the same unsatisfying place.

So I'm doing it this time one day at a time really commiting to change, questioning my world and self views, going to meetings (NA and Dharma Recovery), working steps, asking for help whenever I need it and addressing my mental health issues with therapy and psychiatrist as well. I abandoned old friends, places and habits that reminded me of my drug use too. That was the hardest part but now I'm focusing on myself and my health instead of what others would think of me.

I always knew I enjoyed weed, I smoked from time to time when I was a teenager. When I moved into a place where it was legalized and normalized I guess I fell into a rabbit whole. I’ve been smoking every day since. Surely it started out okay, a way to relax, get creative and just a FUN thing to do right ? Today I’m struggling with health problems: very quickly out of breath and have had chronic post nasal drip. My mental health has also been struggling most of all. I’ve been having so much anxiety (I know anxiety kind of a part of being human) but I’ve never struggled this badly before. I have trouble regulating my emotions and even identifying them, i always think “im high anyways so it’s not my real emotions it’s fine” but im high all the time… I’ve been isolating myself from people, because recently I realized how socially anxious I am when im high, and since I smoke everyday I usually spend those moments alone. I have many reasons for trying to stop smoking that have to do with my mental state, ever since I released control over myself. I feel like marijuana took control over me, and now my mind perceives me as weak, plays tricks on me all the time. And I guess I have been perceiving myself as weak aswell. I’ve lost an immense amount of love for myself, my self-esteem has really taken a fall. I keep putting myself into a place where I know I shouldn’t be smoking because I have responsibilities but I do it anyways. And then I sit there hating myself, drenched in guilt and self-loathing… but hey at least I’m high right. Recently I’ve been trying to reduce my use but it hasn’t worked, I think the only way to stop is to completely cut out smoking. So I guess that’s why I’m here. I don’t even want to leave my house today because I’m scared if I see any opportunity to buy weed, I have no control. I will be high without even thinking twice.

I quit using cannabis 7 days ago. I had been smoking about a gram a day for FIFTEEN YEARS, from age 16 to 31. 

I am a survivor of sexual, child, and domestic abuse, & a complicated mental health case that has received diagnosis’ of CPTSD, major depression, general anxiety, & bipolar 2 (all different doctors with conflicting opinions- but that’s another story for another time)

I began my journey with marijuana as most do, recreationally. I had a creative & fulfilling group of friends that seemingly used pot & hallucinogens semi-regularly in service of spiritual and mental awakening. We made music, wrote poetry, made art, & soothed each other’s traumas- and my romanticized viewpoint of pot would often come back to these times whenever I thought about quitting. 

However, those days were in 2006. My relationship with pot quickly became something more personal, more hidden, more… necessary. Before pot, I used to cut myself, an act I know now that I did in the aim of forcing disassociation- a reprieve from the abuse I was experiencing. A way to have control and agency, something I was not afforded in any part of my life previously. It makes so much sense now that pot replaced that for me, a more socially acceptable form of self-harm.

However, the cloud of pots’ influence began to erode the potential I had to create a fulfilling life of my own. I lost jobs, flunked out of college, and settled. I left the path of my dream job to settle for the restaurant industry- a place that often welcomes drug & alcohol abusers with open arms. I settled for men that abused me in many of the same ways I was abused as a child. I settled for friendships and professional contacts that did not dare to challenge me or expect greatness & success from me. 

The path to this point I am at now has been long and winding and painful. I had to face my pain and regrets through the clouds of smoke for several years before I was ready to leave this life of being a pothead behind me. But through an intense and overwhelming desire to make whatever time I have left in this world worthwhile, and the support of what may be the worlds best therapist & my newfound but solid support system of friends and family, I have mustered up the confidence and drive to push forward into a future where my “peace” & “happiness” no longer come from a plant, but are innate within me. 

I want to remain active on this sub & use the clarity, peace, & love I am experiencing in this new life I am forging to inspire and motivate those who are in the place I was last year when I found this sub- lurking, wishing I had the strength and confidence to join you all. I want to share with you all the reality I am facing now- that I definitely am worthy of a good fucking life. Pot confused that for me. It fed into my darkest thoughts and fears and facilitated a life of settling for less than I am worth. 

I am so sure that someone, if not many someone’s reading this are in that same state of mind, absolutely fucking WRONG about what they are worthy of and who they are without this drug. 

I will do what I can to stay active here and share what I’m learning as I move through this journey. Thank you to all who contribute here, this sub has done so much to get me this far, and I am honored to finally be in a place to offer something back to it.

Two years later and I’m right back to “how the fuck am I ever gonna be ok without this?!”  I’ve been in therapy and I’ve concluded that I want to be sober again, I just don’t want to do what it takes in order to be sober.  I asked my partner to take everything I had and remove it from the house. I’m currently white knuckling it and it’s pretty tough. I had a lot of support before that I don’t have now and I’m also embarrassed because almost everyone I know didn’t know I’ve been relapsing.  I don’t know if I need advice but I’ll take it anyway.

I've been very busy with my college classes and I just feel so stressed all the time and never seem to have much time to do fun stuff. I used to use weed to get me moving in the morning. It gave me motivation to go about my daily routine, although I was never as productive as I am now sober. I also used it to unwind. I depended on it for this. I find myself recently craving the feeling of instant relaxation that I got from weed. It made me feel like no matter what everything was going to be okay. It also made me slow down and just take in the world around me and appreciate it and just be happy to be alive. I'm probably just romanticizing it idk. The problem is that I feel like nothing in my sober life matches that level happiness and relaxation. Does anyone have good suggestions for things that give you fulfillment or help you relax? 

I am currently going through finals and I have a massive amount of work to get through and I have been thinking a lot about rewarding myself with one night of smoking and that maybe I can just use it as a reward after big accomplishments that require a lot of hard work but my boyfriend and my therapist think that it's a bad idea. Honestly deep down I have a feeling they might be right. But I can't help but feeling like I deserve a reward like that. It really gets to me when I think about how many college kids get to smoke after finals but I can't because everyone is afraid I will start smoking daily again. I feel like I could limit it to just a reward for big accomplishments, especially if I've gone this long without it, but idk if I'm just being delusional.",3

I had a solid year under my belt with only one or two single instance slip ups.

1. 1 relapse won't destroy my progress....I've come this far, and my brain has rewired somewhat.
2. The actual high wasn't as good, I immediately realized why being sober is better
3. The next few days after my relapse, I felt back to normal, the withdrawal wasn't intense at all.
4. Don't ever fall back into the habit of smoking weed, after a relapse, and don't ever plan your relapse.
5. Stop worrying about day counts, it takes you out of the present
6. Don't talk about weed with other people, it leads to relapse
7. Usually when you relapse it starts with a thought, then an idea, then a plan.
8. It's not worth it, but it's also not the end of the world, if you've relapsed after 3 + months, you will feel back to your normal sober self, very quickly.
9. Not encouraging anyone to relapse, but in a way they're beautiful, they remind you that you're not perfect, and you learn from them, they make you stronger
10. Relapse's make you value your sober self more, it's easy to forget about the benefits, when you get into that sober routine.

Hope this helps,

Back to being a SoberLegend",256

After about a year of smoking I started getting all these problems  from getting really bad highs where I would just go paranoid and overthink my life, regrets and problems from like 10 years ago came back and I was overthinking all the time. Depression and anxiety I had everyday I didn't want to do anything or talk to anyone and was exhausted all the time. I thought I had something like schizophrenia. I had short temper and felt like I was going crazy. I was extremely bored with no motivation or hope. My life was a living he'll.

 So I decided it was time to quit. I tried several times to quit and failed. And at that point I was still getting bad paranoid trips and if I was getting high it would be for like 15minutes. I couldn't stay away from weed even though it gave me all these problems I would just always just wanna smoke to hopefully get that good high feeling. I felt like a crackhead the only thing I looked forward to in life was hoping I could get a buzz for a few minutes. I didn't realize how hard it was to quit, couldn't sleep couldn't really enjoy anything no attention span at all really exhausting everyday  felt like it was taking forever I just wanted to fast forward my life.Eventually I quit during the week and would only smoke on Saturdays and Sundays but that really didn't help a whole lot I had to quit for good. 

Everytime I would give up and smoke, the next day I would quit again so it was really tiring me out just the thought of having to start the fucking grind the next day again Eventually made me at least think twice about smoking that night. I had short goals would try to quit for a week, then 2 weeks, to 1month then I actually made it to 3months twice. What helps is quitting caffeine and sugar which will give you an extra hour of sleep which was huge, and hitting the gym, cardio and weights help alot too even though I had 0 energy.

Skip ahead I'm  at around 16months no smoking. I can get maybe 6and a half hours of sleep max. Depression and anxiety all the time still but not nearly as bad. I'm still hitting the gym and starting playing hockey this year as I haven't played in a few years. Really just trying to get my life back. I have good and bad days alot more motivation now at least, I was thinking at looking for a 2nd job just to make some extra money and keep myself busy. I still have this boredom feeling and sick of everything feeling. I wanna go skiing more this year and ice fishing more just to try and kill this boredom feeling. The things I've loved most  my whole life like playing hockey or other sports, or watching sports, or even video games  I get sick and bored after like maybe half and hour and I just force myself to keep playing and hopefully will start to fully enjoy my hobbies again.i used to like seeing friends all the time enjoyed the company but even now I would just rather being alone even though I know it's better to be around people or doing something to keep me from Depression. I would just like to enjoy my weekends again.

I'm also trying quitting drinking because it's not as fun anymore either and maybe think it's part of the problem but I only drink like 6times max a month. I just want to know when or if this intense boredom feeling will go away and I can  actually enjoy life again. Every couple weeks seem to improve for me ever so Slightly but just want to know how long this phase will take. I just try to keep myself busy at all times and make sure I get 6hours of sleep and hopefully I can feel 100% again.",12

Don’t tell yourself it’s just anxiety.  I tossed my stash that night. 


Lucky for me, I had an amazingly rewarding experience from being sober yesterday.  I meditated for 45 mins and felt this kind of supreme “okayness”.  I felt open and totally interested in my body and using it.  I headed to my piano keyboard with no idea what to play, no plan.  Holy shit.

I’ve considered relapsing but in reality I can’t. The reason I quit was because I developed CHS. It makes it harder that I didn’t quit because I wanted to but because I had to. Funny thing though before I got sick I knew weed was turning on me (the negative effects outweighed the positive) yet I was so in denial. I still think I’m in denial but I can’t help but miss it. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for 3 years and weed made feel better even if it for short period of time. 

One things for sure though, I was a slave to weed. I’m no longer a slave but now I am responsible for creating joy in the everyday and honestly I don’t know how to do that. I spend a lot of time alone (not by choice) and often feel depressed and weed was the only thing I could ‘confide’ in.

Sometimes this shame and guilt is unbearable, knowing those comments of people calling us weak may be true to some extent.

¿How did you turned your own shame into something positive? ¿How do you accept and overcome your fatal flaws despite people ruthlessly pointing them out and even making fun of it? (Please answer something with more substance that ""Just ignore them"")",28

I’ve been in the process of “quitting” or “weening off of” weed for at least 4 months. Every time I start, I am unable to control my cravings and I smoke. I see a lot of people in this sub just quitting cold turkey. My therapist does not think I should try this and that cutting back slowly will be the safest way for me. Has anyone successfully weened off?

Aside from that, I don’t even really know what I am asking. I guess I am just looking for some motivation. 

I am 22F and am surrounded by people who do not understand or even realize that I am struggling with this. I was a sorority girl in college & recently graduated to work a corporate job. I am able to do my work and keep my friends but it’s a miserable existence for me. 

It’s hard for me to even imagine being happy and living a productive life again where I have goals & enjoy little things like I used to. I used to be a social butterfly and now I have to bite my lip at social events until I can finally go home and smoke. I can’t eat, sleep, get lost in music or writing, find anything funny, or stay out late unless I am stoned. It’s just so hard to suffer through quitting because my motivation and happiness is completely gone. I’m not even happy when I’m high, I’m just functional. How can I look forward to a happy, weed-free life when everything feels and looks so grim?",12

I drove Uber for years busting my ass to raise enough money to fund my projects. 

During these times my stress levels were through the roof. Not only was I concerned about making my dreams come true, but I was going against what society said was proper. I felt like a loser many times because of this and this contributes to my declining mental health. I depended on weed a lot. 

Nonetheless, my business is doing great now. But my consumption has been increasing tremendously year after year. I went from smoking a half ounce every seven days to stopping completely on thanksgiving. 

I miss weed and I love it. But when I stopped I’ve become more clear headed. These last 11 days I’ve learned a lot about myself. I’ve become more productive. But the biggest thing is my attention to detail. 

I started revisiting a lot of the automated things my company depends on for sale generation. God damn, they were so bad, they were converting buyers, but I knew I could do better. That’s exactly what I did.  

But today, I take a look at my “year to date” analytics. I realized there is a tremendous spread between abandoned carts and checkouts. I kept thinking why. Turns out, my abandoned cart email triggers were not sending. 

I could’ve easily converted 900-1000 buyers had I had proper email sequencing. I lost $150k on unrealized gains. 

Weed made me dull. I used to think it made me productive. I missed important minor details for so long, things that could’ve been fixed in a day took me forever to find and fix. THIS is the problem with weed. My life has been missing the minor details. 

The sad thing is with weed is that you never know what you’re missing out on until you stop. And when you stop you realize that the details in your life have been neglected. For some of us it may be too late at that point. I’m glad I realized this sooner than later. It’s sad, but I’m motivated now to continue eliminating weed from my life. The details matter my friends.",43

Weird and sad family story, I started smoking when I was 17 yo because of a guy I wanted to impress. From that moment on, I never stopped. Actually escaping from the fights at home and, looking at that now, to don’t do great things in life too.

I was studying because I had to, but I was good in it. I stopped, changed my mind thousands of time  and so my habits. During my 20s I spent my time between two main topics: men and cities. 
At the end of every relationship I went into a strong depression, I moved into another place starting from the beginning and doing always stupid jobs. I am a lucky girl and I’m smart, a good worker so I always have found a solution and every moving have keep me occupied for one/one and half year. Till the next relationship, which I always lived like a drama and suffering “more than normal” (suicidal thoughts, affective dependency…). 

I share this here ‘cause the only thing was always the same was smoking. Looking back, I feel like I enterly spent my time doing “forced thing” (jobs, mainly) and spending all the rest of the time, just smoking.
I also need to say I usually made “positive changes” in my life in positive moments. I mean, when something was going good, like a relationship indeed. So in a totally different mood from the one i experienced this time.
At the beginning of this year I broke up with a guy I was looking at since years, we only spent a couple of months together but it was like a tragedy for me. Mainly, cause I competely lost control starting manipulating, lying and so on. Judments, guilt and shame have been my favorite words for months.

I decided to stop smoking not really to improve myself, at least at the beginning, but more because I felt like desparate and honestly didn’t know how to cope with anxiety and depression. I do therapy.
It was really, really hard to just understand WHY to improve myself now that “everything is lost”.
I live in Berlin since an year an a half (here we go, again :)) and I actually am quite sure I don’t like this place. It’s super cold, too big and too distractive for me. If I go out I don’t like what I see and I don’t like my friends spendiing their evening drunk and getting high of everything.
But, right now, I don’t completely trust myself and my ability to take a decision.
I wanna be honest to myself, and I actually don’t know how to recognize if I truly am. I feel late, late for everything and compared to everyone, expecially people I suffered with. Which is stupid, I know it.

I am feeling better not smoking, at least inside of me. I was scared about the amount of time I had to cope with, I don’t remember what I like to do. 
I started reading, which is already a big thing to me and I don’t really feel bad by my own. 
But I suffer solitude and boredom but, mostly, I still don’t know where to start from to build myself again.
I am 33, this is the 4th huge depression I’m passing by and the worst I experienced.
It’s almost 10 months I am isolated but i somehow feel hope right now.

I am ready for any suggestion, word and experience but I really want to share to everyone is coping with depression is: anyway, I bless myself cause I stopped. I don’t feel OK, but not smoking is AT LEAST saving me from thinking desperate as I did.
Life is shit sometimes and I definitely don’t have a plan to face with it :) I very often feel like I cannot face with the pain, and sometimes don’t understand just why...it has to be so painful. But smoking let me think there is no escape. Which is a bullshit.",3

Not the first time, so I know I can go this first weeks, even if is hard. That is not my problem. What worries me is that my boyfriend smokes a lot and everyday. He says is his medicine. He is not on quimio or having cancer or something like that. He has a background of chronicle depression and after years on pills he decided to use weed instead. Non going to therapy cause he already has his therapy, I guess, He says he will never want to quit. And I meet him and fall in love with him like that. We are together for 5 years in a long distance relationship, seing each other every 2 months for a couple of weeks and for a month on summer. 

I want to quit, for real, cause smoking it doesnt improves my life in any way. The thing is that in 20 days Im going to visit him and I dont know if Im gonna be strong enough to stay sober. He lives in Netherlands, where is legal, and his 2 flatmates smoke a lot too. One part of me wants to try, I know he will has no problem if I ask him to dont do it in the room or in front of me. And I really want to see him and spend time together. But other part of me thinks that is not a good idea. Then I think if being in a relatioship with somebody who smokes everyday is what I want for me.

I never saw a problem with weed, but in my mid 20s, I set a goal for 30 to quit smoking cigs. I tried a few times, failed a few times - but sitting on the steps of my brand new house - I finally made the leap and quit. I told myself then that my goal for 40 was to quit smoking weed. 

It's been 5 months since I turned 40. I didn't see it happening as it happened, but COVID really spiked my usage. I went from going through 1 500mg cart in a little under two weeks to burning through 1 in 3-4 days. I had warned everyone in my life that pushing me to quit would only push me away and everyone I know has given me the space I requested. 

I've been following this sub for months. Reading your stories. Taking in your encouraging words and tough love support I wouldn't allow from those closest to me. 

I wrestled hard with cold turkey vs tapering down and decided the latter was for me. It's been a full week of only allowing myself 2-4 hits off my pen after my work day or after 7pm on the weekends as well as a 5mg gummy for sleep (I started smoking many moons ago to help my insomnia). 

Two nights ago, I cut the gummy in half. Last night, I didn't even take it.

All week I have slept better than expected and my dreams are wild. My mood has been surprisingly calm and controllable. I was so worried I would be taking out my withdrawal symptoms on my loved ones, but I take deep breaths and tell myself I am in control. 

My goal for Jan 2022 is to cut out the week day allowance and drop weekends in February.

Everyone's journey is different and I don't know if tapering down is for everyone - but I needed to thank each and everyone of you for sharing your stories and allowing me the space to have my own.  Your support and encouragement and struggles and vulnerabilities gave me the strength to take the risk of falling in love with who I am when weed isn't running my life. 

I hope you have a wonderful week, holiday, and journey of your own.",3

Why?

I have a voice in my head that keeps telling me that 'I can just smoke until new years eve and start fresh next year.' But..that voice in my head sounds so familiar. It's the same voice that has kept me smoking for so long. The same voice that has been telling me that weed is soothing and helping me. It's the same voice that always keeps telling me that I can stop anytime whenever I want.

I know this voice. But since I've stopped for good this time - first time I've actually thrown everything out - the voice keeps getting louder.

I can feel that I am better off without weed - It's just my second day off tbh but my consciousness is already better, just by not smoking. Just by knowing I am making a difference for myself. I've tried stopping so many times and somehow this time it just feels right. I could feel that there was no reason to wait till next year - why not feel better already now? Why not quit now. And I did and I am so proud of myself for throwing everything out and knowing I am making a huge difference.

But even knowing all this, why do I keep wanting to listen to the voice? Why does the voice make me doubt myself? And.....when will the voice stop trying to convince me that weed is good for me and that weed is the solution to everything?",18

Whenever I quit, my sex drive tanks, and when I do have sex, I finish basically instantly, and also have muted orgasms that feel like basically nothing.

I can reverse this by smoking again. I'm not sure if it is being caused by withdrawal and will some day go back to normal, or if it is something I've always had that is only helped (possibly) by the dopaminergic or glutamatergic effects of THC.

The longest I've quit was about a year and a half, and from what I remember, not a lot had changed.

Individual days are actually a lot longer than I remember when you’re mostly sober. It’s nice to feel like life has slowed down.

Zen Buddhism and Stoicism has helped me maintain a stable mind and taught me how to enjoy life.
Going out with friends or by yourself is a great way to to take your mind off things: Rock climbing, working out, bar shows, the movies, and skateboarding just to name a few.
Becoming healthier everyday is it’s own addiction and now I feel dedicated to trying to become the best version of myself.

I’m on day 51 of this quit, and dealing with some pretty nasty anxiety, brain fog and depression. After quitting, I ended a 2 yr relationship and while it was the right call, going through this and PAWS concurrently has been a lot. I’ve had to entirely cut out coffee as a result, and the one time I had 2 beers (day 30) my anxiety came back with a vengeance the following day. 

After being a long-time pothead (10 yrs) I was able to quit for 2 yrs, so am familiar with the PAWS timeline. Long story short, I got diagnosed with bladder cancer and leaned on weed again as a crutch. I’m healthy now, and after 2 years of vaping weed heavily (g/day) am trying to get life back on track.

I’m just wondering if anyone with similar experience was able to reintegrate social beer and/or coffee, and what that timeframe looked like?

To summarize that experience it started off pretty challenging and uncomfortable but slowly and gradually improved day by day and now I can't (well, I can!) imagine being wrapped up in that lifestyle. Things are so much better. I knew quitting would be difficult and I prepared myself. I looked at it for what it was; recovering from a major self-inflicted injury of the mind.

Part of being finally able to leave weed in the past and move on was figuring out how to cope with life and not turn to an unhealthy escape, like weed or booze. This took a great deal of effort, learning and taking care of and being patient with myself. I can't stress enough how important it was to me to learn these new skills.

One surprising side effect of quitting weed was how those new skills that I developed in order to do so translated to so many other areas of my life. Aside from the obvious benefit of not being a weed addict anymore and all the shit that comes along with that I learned so many new skills. These skills transferred easily to all others areas of my life. Let me list what some of those skills are:

\- **Perspective** on life in general. I made an attitude adjustment on life. On one hand I stopped taking life so serious and made laughing (authentically) and having fun a priority. On the other hand I owned up more to my responsibilities and became more accountable to my obligations and commitments. Actively addressing my responsibilities instead of avoiding them, while difficult, its very rewarding and creates peace in my mind

\- **Socially** I'm more comfortable and in tune with others. I started to go out of my comfort zone socially so I can improve my people skills and hopefully form new relationships.

\- **General health**. I'm more aware of my health in general and take steps to make things better. For example I discovered that gluten and sugar have a major effect on my mood and what I thought was already a profound improvement and my mental health got even better when I cut those out of my diet.

\- **Self-care and self-awareness**. In the past weed was how I ""cared"" for myself, at least that's what I told myself. It couldn't have been further from the truth. Now I recognize when things aren't right, like if I'm not feeling well mentally and figure out what steps I need to take to make things better and what is at the root cause. There is always a solution you just need to have the insight to find it and ambition to do something about it - things weed took away from me.

\- **Coping.** I learned about ways to cope with stress and solve problems in general. My behavior before, when on weed all the time, was pretty avoidant. If there was a way I could avoid something without drastic consequences then I would. Mostly those were just little things but they added up to be a big thing when combined.

Quitting weed was only half the battle. Quitting weed enabled me to make all these other improvements though. Life isn't perfect and never will it be, and that is okay. It's how you deal with the imperfections that matter. I'm making progress now, progress that I'd never have been able to achieve as a stoner and that can be really exciting.",161

On day 3 I was sweating constantly, I was stinky, I couldn’t sleep. I was crying, for the first time in years. 

On day 7 I wanted to drive to the dispensary and get edibles, I resisted. I stayed busy in the gym and around the house. 

On day 14 I tore up my closet and organized my clothes, my random documents, old possessions. 

Now, one month in, the stench of weed grosses me out. I can smell it from my neighbors house at night if I take trash outside. 

It gets better.

My mind is free, my system is clean. I sleep very well, I am constantly remembering my dreams. I’m inspired. I’m busy. I’m involved. My human interaction is much smoother, my memory is sharper.

I have had SOME really amazing nights of sleep. But now, 7 weeks in, I’m having a lot of trouble staying asleep once I get to sleep. Both when I’ve had a few drinks and when I’m stone cold sober. Is this just how sleep is when one is not high? Also is it unexpected or surprising that I am now craving getting high quite a bit still? Well maybe not even getting high so much as the relief of it, or the habit of it. I just figured 7 weeks in I would be over it. 

My wife and I had an honest conversation last night where she told me she doesn’t think I can ever smoke again. I have been back and forth on this but when I’m honest with myself, it is not worth the risk of where I was mentally, financially, emotionally when I was high ALL THE TIME (for basically 5 years straight). 

It feels so good not punishing myself and feeling ashamed all the time. It feels good not having to hide my use from my wife and family and a lot of my friends. I’m more motivated at work and now actually dealing with the trauma and pain of my past. It feels really good. This community has been a huge part of that and for that I thank you all.

I recently went deep within myself, addressed my traumas, and have now come out on top - after 8 years of daily smoking, 5 of those years constantly pressuring myself to quit (and re-try after failing constantly), I'm now 12 or so days weed-free! It no longer feels like a struggle to stay on top, but rather like I've moved on.

* No more urges to go back to it. 
* Being in a busy city (with currently more dispensaries than Starbucks/McDonald's combined), I walk by them without any inclination to go in and buy any.
* Thanks to the pandemic, I haven't seen many people outside of work, which really helps with the peer pressure aspect of relapsing.

Back during my struggle years, I'd always download different weed-quitting/sobriety-tracking apps, thinking they'd help incentivize staying off the grass, yet would (obviously) constantly reset the clock, and make myself feel worse, to the point of giving up on them altogether.

Now that I've made it this far, would y'all recommend downloading them? If so, which ones are favoured by the community, if they're still relevant to the cause? I haven't seen many (well, any) posts/comments mentioning them, and would like to see how my body's healing over time, as a rough guideline.

I hope the holidays treat y'all well!

some things ive noticed so far: 
positives: 
-better sleep quality. it’s easier for me to stay asleep all night. i used to wake up all the time and struggle to fall back asleep without smoking.
-i have more motivation to do stuff. literally anything. laundry, picking up my house, etc. it feels really nice 
-the cravings have definitely gotten a bit better. don’t get me wrong, they’re still very intense. but they’re probably 10% less than they were 3-4 days ago! and that is progress! 
-ive felt way less exhausted during the day!! i used to wake up feeling tired but now i feel kind of refreshed 
negatives: 
-it is SO difficult to eat. nothing tastes good for some reason. it sucks and i haven’t been eating very well, but at least im not smoking.  
-my emotions have been through the roof and i have zero idea how to cope with them because i used to just smoke to ignore the feelings. 
-ive been a bit irritable. i keep snapping at everyone over the tiniest things
-i still have nausea/hot flashes, but instead of them being every 10 minutes it’s only 3-4 times a day! 
-sometimes when im standing for too long i get light headed and nauseated

overall, i can tell i am getting better and every day is getting easier. KEEP GOING everyone!! i promise things will get better the longer you go without. I feel like im starting to snap out of my depersonalization and it feels fucking amazing to feel real.",6

In that timespan whenever I couldn’t get regular access to weed I became a pretty out of control alcoholic up until around 27. The years and timeline are all pretty hazy still but I used weed a lot to help get drinking out of my life. I thought I could keep weed around because I had this positive notion that if it helped me cut out alcohol it can’t all be bad. And that’s the problem with weed it’s negative effects are really subtle and nowhere near as universally recognized like the harms of drinking alcohol. I could have drunk myself to death but smoking myself to death just wasn’t going to happen the same way . And then my teeth started bothering me and my insecurity about my working memory started becoming more apparent. 

No one ever really told me that I ever came across as “stoned” and didn’t see any difference in my personality, which just encouraged me to keep on waking and baking and smoke on a daily basis. I would only take tolerance breaks but those were becoming fewer and far between.

Flash forward to the end of November and something finally snapped inside of me. I somehow reached a breaking point. There was no dramatic moment or revelation other than my vanity about my teeth and embarrassment about my occasional wheeze. The first three days were physically and mentally bleak, but I survived. A full week has passed and I have enjoyed deeply cathartic cries and have had emotionally meaningful convos with my partner.

my attempts to change my lifestyle usually last around 4-5 days and then i’ll hang out with my best friend and either smoke right away or drink, which just makes me want to smoke. i keep getting back up tho and i haven’t lost the motivation to change.

I was trying to cut down over the summer, but when I was traveling, my partner's friends would smoke and I'd join. We left her country and went to a couple other places where we couldn't find any herb, or I was offered some by strangers and I declined. Which is weird for me, but I didn't want to get involved in that in Mexico.

I feel pretty great! I wake up everyday before 9, sometimes even at 7:30 which was impossible before. I don't feel so much brain fog, I actually feel present. I can tell I'm a little less sharp, but I think the more time I don't smoke, the better that'll get. An example is I had an interview booked on the 4th and thought it was on the 3rd because I didn't check the days properly. It worked out though because I got a lease signed the day of my interview. (Moving to a new province is crazy!) 

I've been doing so much to get everything in order. From packing everything we had in storage to move into my mum's until we could find somewhere to live in the city near her. Getting job interviews, viewings, my car up to safety, transferring licenses so I can drive and do my job. And now I'm getting my ducks in a row so I can go back to school next year... Which involves challenging a diploma exam for my last high school credits. 

If I hadn't stopped smoking weed, I wouldn't be so on the ball with everything going on right now. Being back in my home country where it's legal, and not just going to the dispensary right away feels kind of empowering. I turned 27 less than 10 days ago and I feel like a totally different person. Being present and actually contributing to conversation... Rocking that interview I had yesterday without being cocky but honing in a gentle confidence. I feel in touch with my spirit. I don't feel blocked and like I'm constantly trying to escape. Numbing myself out instead of getting the shit done that I need to. I feel like an actual adult and not like a 16 year old in a 27 year old body. Having some hard conversations that need to be had in order to get my life on track. 

Do I miss getting stoned? Not anymore. I don't miss how sluggish I felt in body and brain. I don't miss waking up past 11 am and grouchy. I don't miss feeling dependent on it to the point my moods fluctuate so dramatically. That I ""need"" to smoke in order to feel okay if something tough happens.

The last 8 months (almost) were amazing, truly. It is like finally waking up, like neo from the Matrix waking up. Feels amazing. Feels like suddenly there was this cloud over my brain that finally went away and let the sun shine over my soul. 

I picked up running (again), I missed it through my smoking days, bought a smart fitness watch, and smashed all my records, I was running a 5k two to three times a week, and I did amazing, I felt superb, I had the fitness of a 10 years younger man. 

I ate healthy, cooked every singel meal, green vegetables with every meal, re enjoyed cooking. I met knew people, was able to communicate better and deeper as before my weed era. 

Religious/ philosophically/ existentially or however you name it, I started to rethink my purpose, my morals, my goals, I still do, but I could say, I have clearer goals for life. I started having less depression, also maybe of summer and sun.

I watched movies while being able to re enjoy them agian, artisticlly, I would watch international movies and like enjoy the lightning, the direction, the music, the camera work,,, somethings that I deeply appreciate and if I was high I wouldn't watch any quality movies and would rather watch stupid YouTube vedios.

The first month was for me hard, I won't lie, it was my Religious fasting month, so you can imagine THC withdrawl plus fasting and routine changes. Nevertheless, I think the fasting really helped, I have my own theory but not sure how true: THC is stored in the fat, When I fast and do also exercise, I tend to lose a lot of weight, including fats, so...

Anyways, as days pass by, I rarely think of it. But also honestly, sometimes I remember and say: man I wish I can hit one now, or even I find myself like imagining rolling one. 

My friends who are daily smokers, got used to my decision of not smoking. I the beginning they would pass and I say no, now they don't even pass, and if it happens they would apologize,,, great achievement of you ask me. And when I say no, I automatically think yes , I can say no, I chose to say no, and people got used to it and followed my wishes and respected my decision.

Winter is coming. And this time is my worest ever times. Depression hits. It is cold ass winter, no sun, so gloomy and dark. Holidays also are coming, most of those I know usually travel somewhere, and I am usually on the alone side. Which is a lethal combination.

I honestly get scared,,, I caught myself thinking of texting a friend for a hit, or to go buy. And I tell myself come one, just one, it's eitherway holidays, no harm. 

But I know myself, I tried many times to stop before, and when the xmas holidays comes, I find myself automatically rolling. And then keep smoking cuz I dont wanna wake up, and from that point it is a spiral.

I really hate how it is. Just one and suddenly months have gone, your bank account is almost empty  and you are 4 years behind your schedule. Fun times cost you. If not money, then health, if not health then your time,,, and time is more valuable then money belive me. 

I hope the winter pass without falling in this spiral,,, the darkness eats me,,, and I am weak enough that one little push and I down falling from the tower of babel. Yet, I am strong enough to admit my fears and look myself in the mirror and say NO. I maybe think I want one to relax, but No, I know where it will lead to, I would rather have a winter momentary depression then years long depressions and regrets.

I hope you guys too have the strength to admit and face yourselvs and say No.",11

I spent the last hour in autopilot, as if my brain was working on its own, scratching the bottoms of every drawers and the whole floor of my bedroom. I managed to have the equivalent of a joint. I didn't know it was possible to find so many bits of weed. 

But, when the smoke time comes out, I think back to those three weeks, certainly among the hardest of my life. And I couldn't, didn't want to.

I sent a message to my boyfriend, who for almost 4 years has only known me as a drug addict. He has seen me come back to life for the past 3 weeks. I couldn't do this to him. We talked, he was very supportive. I talked about my emotions, it passed, and I threw the joint down to the toilet.

I have never felt so good with myself, or so strong, at that moment. One more battle has been won. 
I won't give up, not tonight. 

We can do it, guys.

 \--

As someone who has grown up with medical professionals telling me that my perception of emotion is irregular I have found myself throughout time questioning the authenticity and purpose of my feelings. I still feel as though this is a mystery to me in many ways but over time I have gained a consciousness of one emotion that gives me great peace. In this day and age we consume media not only in a physical sense coming to at 4am realizing you have spent the past 7 hours scrolling through reels or creeping through Pinterest trying to find the perfect saturated image that can feed you the serotonin to allow you to drift into a dreamscape of wanderlust. I feel quite fortunate to find myself in a position where my every day is surrounded by beautiful landscapes and a living situation that makes running to faraway places just a turn of my ignition. However, it became a very strange realization that it, at least for me, is far simpler than that. 

You see, growing up I found beautiful things quite uncomfortable, I would sit there and stare at it feeling this immense pressure that something should feel different, I would look around at the people surrounding me and see gasps and tears, an encapsulating emotion that seems to be taking over them and leaving me behind. This transferred into my teenage years grasping to faint understandings of hormones and insecurities spending my weekends with friends smoking pot and sinking into some stained basement couch cushion until the first bell rang for class Monday morning. This to me, was what I thought that emotion I longed for was. Naturally, my substance abuse increased and became the only rational route to fun. The human understanding of the mind is still such a mystery to even the most dedicated professionals, now when you add that with additional releases of dopamine and serotonin and multiply it with experiences and traumas, well, there is no calculator that can crunch those results. So alas, my brain felt quieter and every night could be a party with a couple grams of mama ganja.

It wasn't until I was eighteen on a solo trip in Garibaldi Provincial Park in between Squamish and Whistler BC sitting on panorama ridge about to pull out a nice tightly rolled joint I had been looking forward to my entire way up that it hit me. Here I am 2,133 meters above sea level, my heart pounding and my lungs finally catching a breath, alone. Now like I said, my psyche is a continuing journey I am on to comprehend and I really can't tell you if it was the sobriety or the solitude that caught me so off guard that day but for the first time in my honest recollection I felt peace. I was looking for no one and craving nothing but the tempo of my own pulsations and insufflations reminding me that I was here, alive, and feeling something so simple. 

I quit smoking that day and I wish I could have said it was something that stuck but some demons are more complex to conquer. I did however gain a new power on that ridge and it grew as a returned to my home, I can't say that my emotions are or will ever really be this “normal” people speak of (though I’m skeptical anyone's really are) however I stopped looking for it and instead started growing it inside finding peace on everyday street corners, new discovered trails, and here, writing this. I am happy to share that I am one month sober today and though I hate it 90% of the time I can say that peace is easier than ever.",2

2021-12-05 16:12:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r9pjep/thoughts_about_common_coaddictions_tobacco_porn/,"Thoughts about common co-addictions: tobacco, porn, videogames, ...","I haven't seen this mentioned very often here, if at all, so I thought I'd note some observations I made in myself recently. I've realized that my three main addictions -- weed, tobacco and internet porn -- are really quite entangled.

First, a quick note to say that when I say porn addiction, I'm probably not referring to use that is far outside of the ""normal"" range: I'm thinking of viewing once or more a day, depending on severity. I class this as an addiction in myself since I found it surprisingly hard to stop and realized how compulsive it was, as well as noticing various negative effects on motivation, mood, sexual function, etc. I wouldn't say I myself am ""addicted"" to videogames, but I believe it is also possible since they affect the dopamine system, just like porn, tobacco and weed do.

The patterns I've noticed are as follows: if I have weed, I will manage to scrounge tobacco to smoke it with. If I have weed, I will smoke it while watching porn. Conversely, if I insist on not smoking tobacco, e.g. using a weed vape only, I will use weed less compulsively. If I am not smoking weed or tobacco, I will not have such a major trigger for porn use. I only desire to smoke  tobacco when I'm smoking weed or drunk. I'd be willing to bet that if I could ""decouple"" my porn and weed use, I would find weed less tempting to use as well. 

I've managed to mostly quit all three -- I can often go two weeks without weed or tobacco and a week without porn. However, I haven't sworn off any of them for good yet. Sometimes I will have a few cigarettes when I'm drunk or a single, relatively tame viewing of porn during a sober week -- and that's not great, but I get back on track quickly. But the worst and most tempting slip-ups are when I end up using all three at once for a ""binge"", which seems far more appealing than using any of them individually, and may then last for a few days (and taking some days to recover into feeling okay again) before I manage to kick it.

I think it's reasonable to suggest that ""stacking"" three dopamine-releasing activities is more addictive than any one of them in isolation, and seems (to me) to lead to a correspondingly bad ""comedown"" effect afterwards. I believe the evidence is in favour of this perspective. Releasing more dopamine like that leads to a correspondingly big drop/long afterwards, which means I spend the rest of the day (at least) either feeling relatively bad, sleeping or looking for the next high.

I realize now that for years I was caught in such a cycle, where I never abstained for long enough to feel ""okay"" sober -- I was always in such a dip, thinking that was just what life was like without weed/etc. In fact, I was essentially using all the ""pleasure"" of the day in a couple of big rushes, leaving the rest of the day in comparable boredom/anhedonia. Now, without those addictions, my day feels like there can be lots of little pleasures: eating, exercising, working on something interesting, socializing, etc. Chemically, each of these pales in comparison to the triple-hit of dopamine from my addictions. Experientially, spreading things out is much better, because the triple-hit wasn't correspondingly pleasurable: I may ""enjoy"" my addictions for, say, an hour twice a day, but then the rest of the day is spent feeling bored/depressed/anxious/etc. And that's just in terms of ""pleasure"" -- not counting more existential concerns like ""am I spending my life in the way I want to be?"".

Note, this doesn't necessarily mean that the best way to quit is to quit everything at once. I think that's a personal choice. I've personally had good success by tapering down each of my addictions, and I don't actually want to be forever without weed or porn (cigarettes can fuck off though). However, I will say I think there is lot to be said for ""decoupling"" things: in my case, to not smoke joints, but just weed alone, and to separate smoking weed from using porn. 

I'd be interested to hear everyone else's thoughts on co-addictive behaviours.",14

I'm currently on day 25 and I am still sweating like crazy mostly at night - When I first started I was sweating all the time, but now it's just a ton at night STILL.

And I am still having trouble eating.. like I'll feel really hungry and go through all the trouble of cooking something amazing and then I can barely eat it.

I am just wondering when did your appetite fully go back to normal approximately and when did the night sweats end?

When I quit before over 9 years ago, I think I remember it took about 5-6 weeks for my appetite to come back but I definitely don't remember dealing with these sweats or actually any other crazy withdrawals I've been dealing with - maybe the green was different in the early 2010's I dunno. Luckily the nausea and vomiting part is gone but that never happened to me back in the day.. It only lasted about 5 days, but it can be very easy for me to get nauseas again from eating too much or too quickly (and by that I mean like a normal person since my appetite is effed right now)

Thanks guys.",2

Over the past 8 days I've realized just how bad that habit was for me, even aside from the mental aspects. It sucked away my motivation, made socializing in a meaningful way much harder, my diet and eating habits were awful due to only being able to eat while high and always wanting calorie dense bad for me foods, and god the late night snacking was horrendous. That's not even all.

I have been a pretty routine smoker for about 5 years now (I'm a 26m). In college, it was several times a day pretty much every day, especially the last two years. Since graduating, I've continued to smoke almost every day, but only at night on weekdays (after work) and more aggressively on weekends. I've had a few stints of trying to quit and succeeding for some periods of time. Notably, I stopped for about 1 month back right after I finished college, and was actually able to completely stop for 2 months when COVID was starting. In both of these occasions (and others that have lasted just a couple weeks), I generally fall j to bad habits after I smoke one time and then slowly slip into more regular smoking and eventually hit a point where it comes back to every day. 

While I don't have anything against weed (obviously..), I do not think I am my best self when I'm regularly smoking. I don't sleep as well, I feel less mentally sharp, I feel much more complacent, I flake on plans and tend to seclude myself. In an ideal world, I could still smoke here and there (maybe 1-2 times a month) and keep going without the regular smoking downslide. But, I have to acknowledge that I have not been able to do that historically. I'm not sure if I ever will be able to, but I think it's most important to break the cycle of feeling dependent on getting high before I can entertain any ongoing ""relationship"" with weed. 

Today marks day 1 of this new start. What prompted me on this one has been a bad habit I've gotten into over the last month (practically smoking every day), which resulted in my inability to perform sexually last night (used to being high when I'm doing it by myself). I'm not claiming weed was the cause - could've just been anxiety with about the fact I wasn't going to be high and alcohol, but I want to remove that anxiety (and of course all the other factors I mentioned).

Any advice, thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Whether it's about quitting cold vs. phasing it out, mental strategies, common triggers/pitfalls to avoid, anything. It has been so helpful reading anecdotes from others, so I thank you all in this community.",9

Of course I sometimes feel like I need to get off my ass and just fix this part of myself but I'm trying to fight this thing with love and understanding. Anger and frustration just work against me.

I understand why I'm an addict and I just want to learn to take care of myself. I want to change my behaviour so I can start growing again. I've been trying to pick up my old hobbies like cooking, gaming, reading and writing but it's a slow process. Also I try to meditate at least once a day.

Last night I smoked a lot with one of my best friends. Ate myself into a coma and I felt so groggy this morning. This is not what I want. I tried not to linger on the feeling of failure and I made a healthy breakfast, took a cold shower, wrote about it and meditated. I already feel so much better.

They were playing really cool synth-y electronic music. After I arrived I unrolled my sleeping bag under the pulsating lights and settled in for the show, which was to last four hours.

It wasn’t long before the temptation came. Lying alone there with my thoughts and the droning sounds, that weed addiction voice tried to convince me “how much better the music would be with weed” and “how much deeper I’d be able to listen”.

Yeah right. If I know one thing from my own reading posts on leaves it’s that weed destroys my concentration and ability to be present/pay close attention. I let the thoughts pass and I eventually got into a deep listening state anyway without any weed required. 

By the end of the event I was left feeling so grateful for my sobriety all over again. It has changed my life and given me my personality back. Being weed free gives you what weed promises.

Twas a pretty vivid conversation, it was “the shit they don’t talk about in movies” and they thought it was funny when I said/thought it sounds like this is some anime plot and they’ve “never heard anyone explain it like that before”. The way they were talking to me just wasn’t my normal vocabulary, dialect, voice, etc. Felt like unoriginal thoughts that I could never have ended up coming up with myself. 

They went into detail about how they think it works, and that it isn’t all that bad and if I quit doing drugs it will fade, or I might even get used to it after a month. Almost still believe it, it was way too real and it felt like we temporarily opened up a connection when I had a panic attack. They calmed me down, told me to just take a seat and breathe. Also to put down my phone when I was panicking because it seems like it makes my anxiety a lot worse, and to not go downstairs because there was family over and they would most likely realize I’m not okay, I looked like shit. Still recovering from that one, and still debating on whether or not to tell them about it.

A few weeks ago i decided to quit because of obvious reasons (wasn’t getting high, memory is TERRIBLE, no energy, not healthily dealing with anxiety/bpd, spending hundreds a week) I lasted 2.5 days before i relapsed for a whole week. Then, I was free for a day. and relapsed. and now here we are, dead serious and dedicated to quitting this time. Im at the end of day 3, which is the furthest i’ve ever gotten. 
Last night, I had the craziest most vivid dreams ive had in years. Something even crazier is that I SAW MY PHONE in my dream. I was looking at a post someone made about me. I literally did not think this was possible and it’s tripping me out lol. 
The nausea and hot flashes have gotten MUCH better and are no longer every 10 minutes. I experience them probably 4-5 times a day now instead. Ive been staying at my boyfriends and he smokes consistently, but i remove myself from the area if he is going to partake. The urges have gotten WAY better and i feel like for once in my life i have control.

I promise you can do this, especially if i can (i was going through 3g of bud and taking 30+ dabs daily.)",5

TL;DR: Was in a happy yet codependent relationship through quarantine where we smoked a lot and enjoyed our comfort zone together. We broke up in April, and I used weed even more to numb things. Finally attempting to quit and I've had all the feelings come up... 

My thoughts have been all over the place on this one because of ""multiple truths."" My ex and I truly loved each other, felt comfortable despite our flaws, and found happiness together during a difficult time. We had the same core values and wanted a future together of a quiet life with kids, pets, a white picket fence - all that jazz. I loved her more than I've loved anyone, and those feelings have lingered. 

However, we also had a trauma bond with mental health and suicide issues in our families. Our relationship was long-distance, and for the first half I really was willing to leave my city and friends behind to be with her anywhere. This willingness waned, though, and anxiety over the move built up in the back of my mind. I supported her emotionally and financially, and this increased over time, which I realize now was **textbook codependency**. I felt better about my own issues and anxiety by ""helping"" her... I don't think this was a recipe for achieving our long-term goals, but I fucked it all up before we could really try. 

Our anxiety and depression grew and fed off each other to the point where I sought validation by sexting another girl. I got caught and essentially had an emotional breakdown. I've always thought I'm a ""good guy"" but had just done the worst possible thing to the person I loved the most. Yeah, not such a good guy after all. 

She was actually willing to work through it but only if I permanently moved across the country to her. I said I would, but when talking to my therapist I blurted out ""I don't want to move"" in a very knee-jerk reaction. Well, there was my answer I guess, and now I've been blocked and the girl I planned to marry hates me (understandably so). 

I then increased my smoking to numb everything and get through every day. This continued through the summer months until September, when I decided 10+ years of daily smoking needed to stop. I've gone a week or two at a time but always relapsed. I'm on Day 7 again and pushing for a full month this time. I'm working to love myself again after realizing I haven't in a while, and it's largely because I view myself as a degenerate stoner who has sacrificed so much potential. 

Sorry for the essay, and maybe this belongs in r/offmychest but I also love this community and wanted to get thoughts, advice, etc. Best of luck to everyone here in getting past this numbing addiction.",6

Once I graduated school and realized how easy it was to get top-shelf bud from the dispensary, I started smoking an eighth every single day.  $60 a day.

It took years of wanting to/thinking about quitting before I got to this point where it felt ""easy"" though. I had a strong mental and emotional reliance on weed. But once it impacted my health to a level that I couldn't ignore (lung stuff, heart stuff, blood pressure, anxiety, depression) and the negatives all outweighed the diminishing positives, it really clicked for me.

I’m 856 days sober. I’d planned for a while to write one of those long write ups about why, how, what I learned, noticed, etc. but just never got around to it. And this isn’t going to be it either. 

I want to provide some insight and reassurance. Relapse dreams are often prevalent in the beginning and you wake up with guilt initially- followed by relief. Those dreams will subside for the most part, but they never fully disappear. You will go through phases where you try to justify and barter with yourself into relapsing. “I have control now, so one time won’t be a big deal. I’ve quit before, I can do it again.” I’ve tried to convince myself that keeping a sobriety streak is more ego than accountability. “I mean, what’s sobriety REALLY 😏” 

Becoming sober is akin to experiencing grief. It may not be a death, but it is a loss that you have to process. And grief isn’t linear. It will not always feel like a battle though. 

Sometimes the cravings and desire to relapse last a day, a week, or sometimes throughout a few months. And even with knowing you’re better off sober, you’ll still say, “God I miss drugs.” 

The dreams help. The guilt helps. They feel icky but it’s a reminder that you’re doing the right thing. 

I’m an open book for any questions you may have. Keep keepin’ on and stay off the grass, whippersnappers.",5

I tried replacing the ritual with cigarettes, coffee, tea, snacks etc, getting inspired by creative people that are sober, remembering that I wasn't smoking when I first started, but the feeling is still there. The desire to escape, to open doors in my mind, to warp my consciousness.

My go-to solution would be to build a healthy routine and start exercising but it has not proved to be very successful for me in the past — I once got sober and in the best shape of my life for a year and I still felt the same so I ended up relapsing.

I’ve been a daily smoker for the last 10 years or so. I love weed so much but weed doesn’t really love me back. I’ve tried quitting so many times but I’ve always fallen off of the wagon. I stumbled across this Reddit page and it’s been a godsend. When I found this page, I was in the midst of one of my longest and deepest bouts of depression. I hated myself and used weed as a way to somehow live life dead while still being alive, if that makes sense. I was a really, really lonely stoner and I did it to myself. Not responding to texts, calls, cancelling plans all the time leads to no calls, no texts and no plans, eventually. 

Every time I’ve tried to quit in the past, the sheer hunger I would experience would cause me to smoke weed again just so I could eat. Truly the loss of appetite and the weakness and irritability that follows have always been the hardest parts of quitting for me. It’s weird because I know I’m hungry but I just cant eat for the life of me. Food tastes disgusting and after one or two bites, I feel like throwing up. I’ve read advice about working out to stimulate an appetite but my body is on 0%. I have no energy and doing daily tasks is hard enough. I try to keep snacks around me and also food I used to love but nothing is helping. Also, I’d like to add, even when I was a daily weed smoker, I still experienced the same issue. I wouldn’t be able to eat very much until I smoked. Most times, I’d take a lil hit in the morning to be able to eat a small breakfast and then wouldn’t be able to eat until I got home after work to smoke before dinner… 

For the folks who experience the same issue when they quit, how long did it take for your appetite to return to normal? Did you do anything to help stimulate your appetite and how did you get through the starvation phase?

After I left I had trouble getting the hang of life without it for almost 3 months but since then I've been on a trajectory (sorry for the Reddit trope) to the moon!

I've become generally healthier, more active, take time for self improvement and my social circle has changed. Those smoker ""friends"" who used to hang around at our house on most weekends quickly disappeared when we told them we were done with the weed. Most of them have lost touch with us over this past year. But we took up other activities and got in touch with old acquaintances and rebuilt some old pre-cannabis relationships. One of them was an old colleague of mine with whom I rediscovered my love for badminton. Few weeks earlier he told me about this job opening I might be interested in. Fast forward to today, I am waiting on my third and final interview on Monday for a job that will land me with my own cabin in a Bay Street Finance firm (It's like Wall Street but with less swearing)

Things have changed for me since I got clean. I've realised that there's so much to life than ""hanging out and chilling.""

I got into community college, and have maintained a 3.0+ GPA, but this year I have gone downhill in work ethic, motivation, and happiness. I also got a lot of aid for school.

I have spent well over 3k this year. I had never had even 500 bucks to my name growing up throughout hs, and ever since the pandemic started and I got into college I have a lot of money thanks to aid and a car from my savings. I cannot fathom what I have done, and the pain and guilt eats me up everyday.

Some days I cannot function because I feel like throwing up from the guilt and pain of burning my money away. My familys always grown up financially unstable, and I let the idea that ""everyone has their vices"" trick me into burning this much money. I don't spend any money on videogames or online stuff like some of my friends do, and haven't gone out at all since covid.

I feel like a failure at 19. I started my adult years even lower than square 1. I have a lot of fear and dread/guilt everyday for the absurd and unreal amounts of money I have spent. I feel like no one else can be this stupid with money, and quite literally ""BURNING"" it away.

I cannot seem to be able to accept that I am a ""good person"" while at the same time having burned my money and brain all year while my family and parents work hard everyday.

I have been smoking consistently for about 3 years. Almost every morning right when I wake up. I have tried to break the habit but I always find myself right back. When I do quit for a day or two I feel great but I always convince my self to take a little hit and boom! Right back to every single day all day. I feel like if I quit I will think better because I constantly overthink and stress about everything. I think the hard part is not knowing if its going to help me or not but deep down I know it will. Any advice that I can hear from you guys would be amazing and I know this is nicely typed out or anything but I am heading into work and wanted to get this posted so that I can see all the comments tonight.

If so, what tips do you have for coping with these feelings?

Any insight as to why these feelings come about would be wonderful as well!

I wasn’t working because of covid so I had a lot of time on my hands. I’ve been back working since august and doing pretty well. I have one good friend who has helped me the last 6 months, don’t know where I’d be without him. I’m working out 4 days a week. I’m still feeling down in myself and I don’t know when I’ll be happy again, if ever. Maybe that’s the withdrawals talking. I’ve been smoking daily since I was 15 and I’m almost 27 so I’m thinking my withdrawals are going to last longer than most. Anyone who has smoked over a ten year span and quit have any advice or info as to when I’ll start to feel better?",4

I had to write a motivation essay for uni since I'm applying for a new major. I haven't written anything professionally in over 3 years. Maaaan I know I killed it though! Seeing how my brain works sober is a beautiful thing!

I've also had phlegm conjested in my chest for the last few days, so I've been drinking lots of hot water with lemon and honey, it works wonders.

I'm also moving back to my old apartment, which I shared with my best friends. Back to the roots!

I'm still waiting to hear from my immigration attorney about my visa situation, but I have a good feeling deep inside that things will work out. Once they do I'm taking this lesson with my for life! I'm going to hang every failure I had on a wall, to know what will happen if I slip up.

Yesterday, my brother met my ex who I've been meaning to make ammends with and hopefully try working things out, and I think she wants the same, turns out we just needed time!

I am in a much better place now than I was 10 days ago but I'm not over the hump just yet, only thing left is to hear from the university and the immigration office. After that, I will have a. New blank slate, with a completely different outlook on life, a new kind of motivation.",68

I’m 21 now and since the pandemic I was high all day everyday, completely dependent on it. But recently I have been having serious panic attacks whenever I left my apartment. So I toughened up and called a counselor at my university. They urged me to stop smoking if I felt that I could, because they said there has been studies linking anxiety to smoking. As soon as he told me, I stopped. Because frankly, I’m exhausted from this terrible anxiety/panic and will do anything for it to stop. 
Day 4 and I’m already feeling a little better. My dream that I had last night, I still remember it and it felt SO REAL.
My boyfriend still smokes which almost made me relapse today, but I just keep reminding myself that I feel a little better and need to continue to not smoke or else I may go back to how intense I was feeling days prior.

Until the age of 30 I was smoking daily but I was also working a lot and doing a lot of sports. Sport was basically my life and a joint at night made it perfect. 

But then at the age of 30 I had severe herniated disc. The disc was so damaged they had to do surgery and remove it and put 4 screws and a plate on top of it.
From that point I could sport way less and I started to smoke real bad. 
I was still going to work and at working days I always got the discipline to only smoke at night. Days off where wake and bake. But generally I had the feeling i was waisting a part of my life because weed always came on the first place. 

So this summer I quit smoking. Generally I'm doing not to bad sober. Life is in many ways better....

But in the last 5 months I never slept longer then 5hours because of pain. The combination of lack of sleep and pain during the day makes it tempting to go back to smoking. 
I'm sober but I can't live the life I want. For example I can't ride a bike, I can only do low intensity workouts, I can't sit on chair for longer then 30 minutes.
All because of pain.
By the time its evening I have to lay down in a hyperflex position to fight of the pain. 

So I'm at the point of just saying fuck it. Buy a bag of weed, numb the pain and have a good sleep despite the other negative consequences of being a daily weed user/ abuser.",1

TL;DR: do you have ptsd? what have you done during a particularly triggering episode that isn't smoking and what has helped?  
I'm afraid of being vulnerable about this, but this sub has been a serious support to me, and I hope this is received ok. Very few ppl in my life understand this kind of internal push-pull, and I know you guys will get it. I've been feeling so unbelievably great about quitting weed. So much has changed, improved. My relationship, my connections with friends, my work, on and on. After smoking for 9 years almost every single day, I still can't believe it felt so easy to leave it behind. A few days ago, however, I started to feel this sort of mental restlessness, feeling super down and I couldn't figure out why.  I suddenly wanted very badly to ""check out"" just like I always could with getting stoned.   


But yesterday I felt particularly awful and REALLY wanted to smoke...which really confused me given how I had gone months without even a hint of that feeling, and then boom, I look at calendar and there it was: My body \*knew\* it was the anniversary of the Ghostship Fire. My life was turned completely turned upside down that day. I was supposed to be there and decided not to go last minute. I lost many people in my community, my community was torn apart, SA happened right after...and through it all weed was there. Years ago because of all of this & more, I was diagnosed with PTSD + CPTSD and I've been super aware of the fact that one of the main reasons I smoked was because of my triggers. Been in therapy many years for it, and I feel like I've healed so much. But back then, weed both made my mental health worse and held it together at the same time. And every year this week would come around and the memories, the pain, everything comes back... and weed is normally there to lull me, hold me, keep me safe; but maybe also trigger me more.  


But not this year. I've never raw-dogged this extremely triggering week without weed. This is literally my first year I cannot turn to weed. I can't dull out again, yet the ""need"" to is there. PTSD is completely off the charts. I've been randomly angry, intrusive thoughts, couldn't sleep last night. Then I try looking for weed products (which is hilarious bc I threw them all away I believe months ago) and then I get angry at myself for wanting weed, I get more triggered...it would be a hilarious merry go round if it wasn't, well, sad. All today it's been worse and I'm at the point where I haven't left the couch all day because I'm next-level exhausted.

My question for fellow leaves friends who have ptsd, do you have any tips for days like these? what's your new go-to for relaxing during a serious triggered state? does it get easier over time, the animalistic, grabbing need for weed diminish?

Thank you so much for reading, I don't want to take up space about it but I also feel like I rarely talk to anyone about any of it, and well. Maybe I can call this practice. Much love to you all in this journey.",5

I’ve never found it has an effect on me like others as I can present to large groups of people, run half marathons, interact with my friends, etc, but lately it’s just felt like too much of a habit and not an active choice. Its not something I want to engage in anymore and am trying to go cold turkey (I don’t want to go back to smoking). I feel like it’s become a crutch or avoidance mechanism and it’s time to face the music. 

During the days I’m feeling pretty good and managing to work through the cravings. It’s only day 10 of my sobriety journey but my dreams are fucking terrifying. I find myself waking up 10-15 times a night and sometimes I feel so agitated I just give up on sleep altogether. I have no troubles falling asleep but the staying part is a challenge.

For some context, I used to have a healthy relationship with weed until the beginning of the pandemic, since then I’ve been smoking frequently. Not daily but almost daily. It felt great at first but I hated the idea of dependence and instead of facing the inconveniences that appeared in my life, I smoked a bowl instead. It turned me into a loner and I never wanted to do anything anymore except be high and chill. I felt like I didn’t know myself anymore. I recently went on a trip and socialized with a lot of people and was forced to take a break. I realized that I was missing out on a lot of things by being stoned all the time and that I loved who I was when I wasn’t high. So I began this journey.

I smoked the rest of my stash (yes, I should’ve just thrown it away) and have been doing okay except I haven’t been able to get school work done. I have ADHD and I used weed as a crutch to slow me down and keep me in my seat for longer than a few minutes. Finals season is upon us and not being able to focus is stressing me out. Although I don’t have the urge to smoke, the thought of texting my dealer has crossed my mind cause I need to get some work done. I’m not sure what to do. I already exercise often, I’ve been meditating, and I eat well but nothing is helping. I was hoping to ask for some guidance but this ended up being a rant.

Been thinking about quitting for years, but today is the day.  I smoked in high school and college, then gave it up for decades. After my dad passed away in 2006, I started smoking recreationally again, loved it as much as I did in HS. When I shattered my ankle in 2016 I started smoking every day, with doctor and surgeons blessing.  First it was to control the pain, and then to fill the boredom of 8 weeks on the sofa with my leg elevated.  When medical mj came to Florida I got my card, and loved being able to buy top shelf when I wanted.  But now I realize I have been living in a hazy bubble, turning down invitations, avoiding going out, shrinking my life to just sitting all day smoking and vaping.  Since Covid I almost always consumed alone, and it seemed okay.  But I am 61, a grandma, and I want to enjoy the rest of my life.

My depression is so bad the meds aren't helping, and more drugs can't be the answer. Something has to change, so today I took step one.",5

2021-12-03 11:56:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r83kq0/one_week_again/,One Week (Again),"Typing this up more for myself than anything, but a year or so ago I was addicted to carts BAD. I was smoking them like crazy, multiple times every day. Then, I had a severe panic attack. I made the decision to stop smoking weed, and the next few weeks were torture. The side effects talked about by so many others in this sub? Had them all.

But you know what? I got better! So much better, that a few months ago my brain told me, ""hey, you're doing so great now, you can have weed again! You're in a much better state of mind and can handle it this time, go have fun!"" So I did. I started smoking regularly again (this time not carts thankfully). Then I started feeling anxiety all over again, and it all culminated when I was driving to a family member's house for Thanksgiving and had yet another severe panic attack.

Today marks one week off of weed for me since quitting again. This time feels different though. I have been through the withdrawals before, I know that what I am experiencing will not last. This is the weed leaving my body and trying to do everything in its power to cling on. I also know that I will be better again someday. And when that day comes, my brain will try to convince me that I am stable enough to smoke again. I know better now.

Sometimes it takes failing to open your eyes. Even though I'm disappointed in myself for getting here again, I know that I can do this. One week will turn to two weeks, two weeks will turn to a lifetime. If you're reading this maybe you are in a similar position where you're also struggling with withdrawals, and I am here to tell you that it gets better. BUT when it does get better, REMEMBER that going back will start the process over again. Remember these withdrawal symptoms you're having, remember how CRUMMY you are feeling right now, and when you are feeling better and back to 'normal', look back on these feelings and know that smoking again will bring them all back.

- I get paranoid delusions. If I'm alone at the house at night, taking the dog out is a scary thing. I took a knife with me, thought I heard footsteps last night and I brought her right back in, and then I thought I was going to be murdered or raped the rest of the night (this happens a lot honestly).

- I smoke so little compared to what I had been doing, yet I feel like it's intense and it used to not be that way.

- My focus is terrible and I can't focus on more than one task.

2021-12-03 09:55:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r80vfc/some_tips_after_making_it_30_days_today_and_some/,Some Tips After Making it 30 Days Today (and Some Gratitude),"I made it thirty days without weed this morning. Technically I reached four weeks on Wednesday, but still... it felt different to reach thirty days. I have no idea how long I'll try and go without weed. I think it's possible that I just never go back, or that if I do, it will feel kind of awful and shameful and I'll consider it a relapse. Or in a couple of weeks or months I'll start smoking again, but only if I can preserve a healthy relationship with it. That doesn't seem too realistic after the month I've been through though. Here's some tips I learned along the way; I hope these can lend support to anyone on their withdrawal journey right now, and I'd love to hear what you guys experienced in common. 

1. **The first week's worst symptoms are immense cravings and insomnia.** I didn't feel too much of the emotional savagery yet, not until week 2. The first week I just wanted weed so fucking badly. Part of it is psychological -- you can go days without weed if you know you're GONNA smoke it, but knowing it only gets tougher from here on out makes the first few days very craving-heavy. On the third day I took weed out from under my dresser and very nearly packed a bowl. I ended up flipping a coin and it landed on tails, so I said fuck it and put the weed back. 
2. **The second week is the hardest.** I felt miserably depressed, exhausted, utterly enraged by everything I saw and heard. People talking too loudly on the train felt like they were asking me to punch them. My dreams were insane nightmares about my family members dying (that doesn't go away for a bit longer, actually). Maybe the worst part of all is the exhaustion. I felt more physically weak than I have from anything except extreme fevers -- I slept all day, I woke up and just wanted to cry, I was out of breath and constantly on the verge of panic attacks. It felt like I was too weak to climb the stairs. I'm telling you: if you can get past the second week, you can get past anything. You will be impressed by your own resolve. 
3. **The third week was not much better, but the energy slightly improved and the constant irritation definitely improved.** I felt less extremely pissed all the time. I DID still have constant upsetting nightmares. Honestly, the third week absolutely sucked but I felt like it was the last time I truly, truly suffered the withdrawal symptoms. The other thing: by week 3 I was REALLY enjoying myself when I was with friends or family. It still hurt like hell to be alone and without pot, but when with others I felt like I finally had the energy to appreciate others again. My jokes were funnier, my thoughts were faster, I wanted to practically jump around. 
4. **Week 4 is much, much better.** It's still been tough. But there were days during week 4 where I actually forgot I was in the process of quitting weed. I had 'tough days,' even miserable ones, but it didn't feel like this was specifically due to withdrawal. The vivid dreams have continued. Sometimes they're still psycho-level unpleasant; other times they're just weird and way too imaginative. But the depression has significantly improved, and so has the irritability. I don't currently want to punch everyone I meet. I wake up very sad and anxious sometimes, but it's not like the first three weeks. 

&#x200B;

In short: it DOES get better. I smoked five or six times a day for six years; if you've smoked heavier and longer than I have, then you may take longer -- and that's okay. But it unequivocally gets better. 

I also want to say I really appreciate you guys for the kind words when I hit 20 days. I've suffered like crazy but I took solace in knowing I wasn't nuts for it.

**Quick tips:**

A) You'll feel way the fuck better if you eat some greens -- salads, roasted vegetables, spinach, whatever

B) HYDRATE!!! I would drink a ton of water when I smoked but effectively stopped doing so when I quit. This will ruin you. You gotta force yourself to drink tons and tons of water. 

C) The dreams will mellow eventually, don't feel hopeless about it

D) Spend time with others and seek people out who might support you, even if it's just going to a fucking bar or something!",10

2021-12-03 09:48:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r80pxr/cannabis_induced_insomnia_withdrawal_insomnia/,Cannabis induced insomnia? Withdrawal insomnia?,"I will be using the SWIM method to talk for privacy concerns (Someone Who Isn't Me)

SWIM has been smoking daily for 16 years... starting to realize they had insomnia for about 16 years as well.... I know most people get insomnia relief and sleep from smoking weed, but I have a hypothesis and wondering if anyone can chime in. Lets first mention addiction. Typically anything your body is addicted to require that substance in your body by a certain amount of time to avoid certain physical effects. So essentially your body goes in withdrawal making you sick because you don't have the substance, thus consuming the substance makes the withdrawal symptoms go away. Now with this in mind anyone can be addicted to caffeine, alcohol, drugs, medication...etc... Once you are addicted you relieve your symptoms by taking the substance. One common effects of withdrawal is insomnia. For ex. many alcoholics wake up in the middle of the night when their blood alcohol level goes low and in order to not get sick or be able to go back to sleep, they take a shot of liquor and can sleep again. 

&#x200B;

NOW LET ME BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO SWIM. SWIM smokes daily, multiple times a day all day. SWIM is under the influence of cannabis more then he is sober. SWIM sleeps on average 2 to 3 hours a night, its physically killing him, making him ill and sick, and leading to other diseases and illnesses as sleep is the only time our cells use themselves to repair the body and heal any injured areas or cell repair. So is there a possibility that SWIM is waking up after only 2 to 3 hours of sleep because his body is going into a state of withdrawal? I typically smoke when I wake up and it helps me go to bed. However I toss and turn all night. SWIM got arrested previously and was not able to smoke for a month. First 2 weeks he sleep terrible, however after 2 weeks it seems his body wasnt as dependent on weed and was sleeping almost 12 hours a night! First time since his childhood! After things cleared down he began to smoke again and now his insomnia has him sleeping 2 to 3 hours again, killing his body and quality of life. SWIM has glaucoma and Crohns disease, so essentially the cannabis is used greatly as a medication to help with these condition. Would love to get some other opinions on the withdrawal theory, as most people get better smoke with cannabis. But after 15 years I wonder if it has an opposite on the mind and leads to insomnia. Have a great weekend! Cheers",3

Background:
34F; Smoked off and on 10+ years but use has increased over the past 5; I have GAD and extreme panic disorder that’s being treated with daily medication.

I smoked to get away from reality, because I was bored, and to help me sleep. Unfortunately the past few years I have ended up in the ER due to “rolling” panic attacks that were caused by smoking…BUT I’d also be guilty of not taking my medicine. I would get sent home, start my medicine back correctly without smoking for awhile. The next few weeks would be HELL.

My *DING DONG* moment happened last weekend. I ran out, everyone was dry, and I was left cleaning all my supplies for that release. I smoked my last on Monday (12/29) with a friend and he left a little to help me sleep that night. I couldn’t wait until bedtime, I had to get that release sooner. My last official smoke was at 6pm that day. I woke up the next morning, panic/depression/stomach issues started….I was beginning to have the same issues as if I had stopped my medicine again.

Now 4 days later:
Day 1: PANIC
Day 2: PANIC and got sent home from work because I was shaking 
Day 3: PANIC
Today: Still a bit panicked, stomach issues still going
I went ahead and called out from work and due back Sunday. 
All this time I was having difficulty getting back on meds and side effects and it was pretty much the withdrawals from smoking is what made it worse.

I have to quit cold turkey, I have no moderation.

Apparently I have done this before, just need to get through this again and not go back to smoking.

What can I do to make this process smoother?
I have started drinking more water, eat healthy when I can stomach it, and try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise.

I have spent the past few days reading other’s posts, it has kept me level and realizing that all these years of thinking it was completely medicine side effects was really me withdrawing from smoking. 

I’m so scared I’m going to give in because these withdrawals are HELL. I don’t know if I can last another week with all this shaking and anxiety.

I noticed that even when I wasn't high I was still suffering from existential dread and had these anxious thoughts which just wouldn't go away.

Today I was putting the grinder away and I found some powder at the bottom and smoked it through a makeshift pipe, I spent the rest of the night vibrating at an uncomfortable frequency. Honestly being sober is relaxing and my short joy ride with weed has really helped me understand not only how suseptible I am to the addiction but also the amount of stress I was putting my nervous system under day in and day out when I was a full time smoker.

I never smoked during the day, only after getting home from work or in the evening on weekends. It was my ritual to relax. It was always the same procedure:

1. Get home

2. Roll a joint

3. Prepare my dinner

4. Smoke

5. Eat dinner

The plan was always to then play some video games or watch a movie or whatever but in 9 out of 10 cases I just got tired and fell asleep on the couch while watching Netflix or had not actual motivation to play games. Even though I always thought to myself how much better these experiences would be while being high.

Now the weekend is approaching, and it is the first one after quitting without weed. I actually smoked absolutely everything now. There is nothing left. I even scraped resin out of my grinder (the point that showed me that I am addicted), but my stupid brain tells me that it would be so great to smoke up and play video games or so even though I very well know that I would just get sleepy again and not play or watch anything and “waste” my weekend.

Video games are actually one of my favorite hobbies (stupid as that may be) and I am concerned that I will lose interest because I keep thinking “this would be better while high”. So I ask for your experiences with this. How do you get over these urges? How do you silence that voice in your head that says “no, don’t watch that movie / play that game sober because it would be SO much better while high”?",3

This is a pretty big event, to have it in the house in reach and to just go to bed sober feels pretty huge. Im gonna bring it back to my guy later today after work. 

So yea, kinda slipped yesterday but ultimately it turned out to be somewhat of an interesting experiment on temptation and self controll, something I didn't think I had any of a few days ago.

I recently quit smoking weed as I suffered a couple panic attacks while I was high where I had the typical heart pounding, nausea, shakiness, shortness of breath, yada yada. It’s now been a couple weeks since I stopped and I have continued to get some panic attacks, though not to the same degree as those I mentioned earlier. In general I feel better, more motivated, I’ve been trying to do Yoga in the morning, eat better, and do more things that I enjoy doing, as well as sleeping better. BUT, the one thing I have been struggling with more is a feeling of detachment from reality/psychosis. I notice that it goes away in times where I am not thinking about it, or not really paying attention to it, but being away at school and having to spend more time alone than I’m used to post-lockdown certainly makes these feelings a little scarier. Do you guys have any tips and should I expect this to go away over time? It feels like it comes in waves and I’ll have these anxiety loops that feed more and more fear into themselves until I get so anxious (because of feeling disconnected) that I don’t know what to do with myself.

Thanks all,
❤️",1

Stay strong! The road is long and full of bumps and detours but remember your goals and aspirations. Weed won’t help you get there! It’s a major distraction and inhibitor in my experience. Just makes you think you’ve got it all figured out when you really don’t.

Back in February of this year, I decided to quit smoking to study for a graduate exam after nearly a year and a half of smoking 5+ bowls a day every day. It was initially a struggle dealing with the withdrawal symptoms but I was able to stay away from weed by being occupied with studying for that exam. However, in May when the exam was over, I relapsed and relapsed hard. I got back into my same routine of going through nearly a half an ounce a week. Flash forward to about 2.5 weeks ago, I looked at myself in the mirror and recognized that I did not like the person I was becoming and did not want to stay chained down by a seemingly overpowering need to smoke. So I gave away all of my weed and glassware and have since quit smoking for good. I went into this process of quitting with the belief that because I had quit before, I could do it again. However, perhaps it's because I no longer have the distraction of studying for a difficult exam, but the withdrawal symptoms throughout these past weeks have been night and day worse than the first time I quit. I have been really struggling with random bursts of very bad anxiety with serious cravings to relapse and 1-2 day long bouts of rather severe depression. While I experienced this to some extent the first time I quit, these symptoms went away rather quickly the first time. I thought that at this point (2.5 weeks out) these symptoms would have subsided, but they are not seeming to go away. I am trying to remind myself that this is temporary, but words cannot express how painful this has been, especially in those bouts of severe depression. I have fortunately been able to go to therapy to help cope with some of this, but that only seems to do so much, and it seems my brain is just struggling to get back those feelings of reward and happiness without smoking. I was wondering if anyone else who has gone through this or knows of someone who has gone through this has any tips or any stories on how to keep pushing through and remain focused in not relapsing. My biggest fear is relapsing and then kicking this problem down the road and having to experience this nightmare from square 1. Thank you all so much.",3

Saturday mornings were always me time, I’d get high in the mornings first thing, Sunday evenings too because why not? I’m alone those times and just not sure how else to fill the time.

How do you all resist? Is it really realistic to go to complete zero? Many of my best friends smoke so I know inevitably I will again on occasions.

I spent a ton of money on pot, vapes - it was all so much. Then in February I had a complete mental breakdown - cannabis induced psychosis. I terrified my friends, my family and was sectioned for around 12 days. I was delusional and psychotic for a little over a month total. It seemed to take forever the right meds. Crippling depression, anhedonia, a total lack of joy in every aspect of my life. I'm still working through it all and will continue to do so for quite some time. Traumatic doesn't begin to describe it.

But I can honestly say I'm in such a great place right now. Not only did I quit pot but also drinking (can't on my meds), began meditating and lost around 20 pounds from the weight I put on due to covid and anti-psychotics. I've often told my therapist that it's like my life is in high-definition now. I appreciate the smallest things so, so much more. The way my neighborhood looks as the seasons change. The quiet moments with my girlfriend and our pets. Morning light when it spills into my home office. I was so convinced that pot was safe, it was non-addictive, etc. I was incredibly addicted.

There is no more drowsiness, no more feeling like a zombie, my mental acuity has increased tenfold (though of course will take much longer to get back to total normalcy, if that even happens) and I am *HAPPIER*. It took me stopping for a few days to realize how fucking miserable I was constantly getting high and being an emotionally numb cadaver. Here's a list of things I've done just in the past few days that I had been putting off for months (and some for literal years):

- I started studying for my drivers permit (I'm in my late 20's, life experiences precluded the need to get it up until this point)
- I got an STI screening that I'd been meaning to get for about a year
- I moved forward in my application for grad school
- I'm starting to talk to my dad more who Ive had a very strained relationship with over the years

I also broke out this old record player I had in a box and started listening to some albums I'd accumulated, and I got very emotional listening to some of them because I realized that I'm starting to authentically enjoy doing things that I like again.

Currently even many parks close at night so there is truly no where for people to go that they aren’t persecuted and unwelcome it’s no wonder we see them on the street sleeping. Stuck in a limbo between freedom and the realization that there is no where to be free they are forced to be free in front of people who aren’t. It looks like more suffering than those who live in houses and in many ways it is. But at the same time those people are closer to truth than even me who has a car. Those people are closer to the realization that we are not free.,27

When waking I woke and felt the pressure on my face.
Other then that fine just kinda thoughtful of my dream haha

These dreams as bad as they can get dont really bother me. Idk when I wake up and as I get close to waking up I have always realized im dreaming sorta but I choose to engage with the dream and live out what id do(like a little movie lol)

If anything I seem to be sleeping alog as I taper off and try and quit. I'm going to get some tea to start a morning/night rituals and possibly day time ones if needed. But the goal is to move past all this, but I do wonder how my dreams will be. Might be gimd for dream journal lol🤣",3

Today I got a new game from the library to play with my kids tonight, and I'm actually looking forward to it. Usually I would be too tired/faded in the evening to be interested in doing that. This feels good 🧡",46

I was smoking weed to block out reality.  From facing my demons.  From facing hardships of the present.  Why is my career stuck?   Why are my social relationships not improving?  Why am I not growing as an individual?  

Now that I'm sober I am finally improving my life.  It's not easy. And it can be stressful.  And uncomfortable.  But the best high is getting better.  From seeing success.  Not a fucking plant.",22
2021-12-02 13:43:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r7e5gs/worried_that_i_may_have_developed_psychotic/,Worried that I may have developed psychotic symptoms.. but still can't stop,"Hey. So I [M23] have been smoking for about 10 years. I started smoking more heavily when I was about 15. Since then I have been smoking pretty much everyday, except for maybe 4-5 months worth of days where I haven't smoked anything.

I've been trying to stop since at least 17 but obviously, I haven't been successful. And no, this isn't a habit. For me at least, it's a full on addiction. Once the prospect of smoking weed enters my brain, I act like a stereotypical junkie (ie manic, irritable, jumpy, fidgetty, etc) and I won't stop until I have SOME kind of smoke, and I'm resourceful enough to ALWAYS find a way. It hasn't helped that my whole life is just one big trigger. I come home, everyone's smoking. I see my friends, everyone's smoking or buying smoke. It's gotten to the point now that I'm starting to question my own mental health.

I'm very much aware of the fact that my brain will stop developing pretty soon, and for the majority of that development, I've been doping my brain with a psychoactive substance pretty regularly. I'm so angry at myself for limiting my potential like I already have, in such an irreversible way. My worry is that I will lose my job and ruin my life if I seek professional help. I can't go on anti-psychotics AND have a driving license (which I need for my job and my wellbeing in general), it doesn't work that way and for good reason. But if I lose my job I already know that I will 100% lose the will to live.

Lately (or perhaps a lot later than I think), I've become quite paranoid. I really distrust people and I semi-consciously believe that everyone thinks I'm weird/a piece of shit/an idiot and that they're only out for themselves. This paranoia is tremendously exacerbated during withdrawal, and I actually confront people on my delusional(?) beliefs with an aggression that is disproportionate to the real situation. At uni I've noticed other students talking about me and laughing (or maybe they're not) and it distresses me a lot. I've considered confronting these people but there's a part of me that knows that they'll be like ""what the fuck are you on about mate"" and then they'll really be giving me dirty looks. I've started to question if the lecturers also gossip about me, and I REALLY REALLY don't want to get angry at a lecturer (obviously because I will get kicked out of uni but also because I actually respect these people a lot). 

An incident happened at uni today that's really sent me into a weird mental state. I was sitting down in the cafe when a group of students walked past me to get to the cashier, laughing. This started to make me feel anxious. Then they walked past me again because they realised that the cafe was closed, but when they walked past I shit you not one of them said ""fuck it lets go in and rape [My first name]"". Now. The most likely scenario is that they were making a weirdly fucked up joke about someone they know with the same name, but regardless this event has been occupying my mind for the rest of the day ""Am I paranoid or did those guys just joke about raping me?"". As soon as I heard that, my mind became overrun with anxiety, low self-esteem and an urge to act with violent aggression. 

I also have these kind of thoughts about colleagues. I believe that those with the same role as me are constantly trying to one-up me and make themselves look better than me to our more experienced colleagues, even going so far as to lie about me behind my back. I've thought about hurting them and almost did punch one of them when I was going through withdrawal because they were having a laugh at my expense. But thankfully I've kept myself on a leash for the most part, with some ""outbursts"" when I'm sober. I really don't want to get to the point where I've actually caused harm to someone.

When an event causes me to become really anxious or depressed, I cut all contact with everyone without explanation. This has affected a few of my relationships. I've isolated myself quite a lot in the past year and some people actually thought I was dead. Keeping up with social obligations has just become.. hard? I just don't have the energy for it.

I'm stuck guys. I don't know what to do. I'm so burned out and the smoke is just making it worse. I'm scared of what the future may bring. I want to and need to stop smoking because it's affecting every facet of my life in a negative way but my willpower is non existent at this point. What would you do?",4
2021-12-02 13:43:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r7e590/one_week/,One Week 🤯🤯🤯🤯,"Well here we are, day 8. Look at me. First time seriously trying to go cold turkey and its gone well, so I am going to share what has worked for me (and what didnt) because it may help some of you fine people.


5 things that really helped me: 

1 - Keep It Out Of Your House - commit. 

2 - Night Walks / Going Out - a big part of my dependency on weed is that its just an easy way to stay occupied. A cure for boredom. I reduced my consumption significantly over the past couple months to the point that I was only smoking after 6 on most weekdays, so naturally night is when quitting is the hardest for me. I get bored and I need some type of stimulation (read my day 1 post). On nights that I have nothing to do, walks are an easy healthy cheap way to KEEP BUSY. I set a timer and go half an hour out, half an hour back. Sucks leaving, but I always feel great when I get back. I have left the house 5 nights since last Thursday. 

3 - Journaling - if there's one thing I would like you to try its this. Writing down how im actually feeling helps get the negativity and angst out of my head. Just physically acknowledging how I'm feeling goes a long way for me mentally. Be totally honest with yourself. I don't do it every day but when I'm feeling really bad it helps so so so much. I don't structure any of it and I don't go back and read anything. I have been doing this for a long time but I think it has helped a lot with this. I have written 3 days since last Thursday. 

4 - Showers Before Bed - 0-effort strong sensory experience. I have been walking before. Nice way to get ready for bed that isn't staring at a screen. I do room temp/cold showers in the morning and hot at night but honestly I'd probably do hot showers only if doing multiple a day didn't wreck my skin. I do this every day. 

5 - Sleep Podcasts - Never used these before this week but I have been enjoying having some quiet noise to put me to sleep. I haven't slept sober in a long time so having some help is good. ( I have been listening to 'comforting sounds' on Spotify which is just 3 hours of soft noise ). I have fallen asleep to some type of media every night since last Thursday. 


5 things that did not work for me/made things harder: 

1 - Misc House Activities -  reading, elaborate cooking, colouring are all things that get recommended a lot here but I will say they have not been helping me at all. Being stoned is way more fun than these things and using them to replace it didn't work for me. Can't focus. Coloring specifically made me viscerally angry. If you like these things then I am truly happy for you, I just cant. This might change with time.

2 - Drinking - as a long time stoner, being hungover without weed is pretty awful. 2 days this week including last night. 

3 - Video Games - I have had a pretty unhealthy relationship with games in the past (read day 2 for info) so take this with a grain of salt but I just feel empty after I finish playing. I will say I wanted to smoke more during/after gaming than any other point this week. Warframe and TFT. 3 days. 

4 - Shopping - i gave myself a healthy daily allowance this past week to keep myself occupied as I quit. Very fleeting sense of satisfaction and again I just feel like getting stoned when its over. Stopped on Monday. 

5 - Social Media - there's lots of great advice on this sub, but scrolling endlessly on this app (or Twitter or Instagram) really leaves feeling more bored than when I started. I have done this to some degree every day.


Anyway, this will be my last post on this sub for some time but know I wish you the best with your journey to better yourself and I am sure every single person reading this can reach their goals if they commit and stay busy. 

I will leave you with the most helpful thought I read on this sub: 

'You aren't bored, your brain is just trying to convince you to smoke'

Good luck leavers. Take care.",9

I’m a year clean as of 11/27. Never thought I’d do it, it wasn’t easy and I had lots of cravings but I made it! I got a job and a promotion in all that time, which never would’ve happened without my sobriety. 

I always thought I’d be happier smoking because it’d help numb the pain. But the truth is that pain is an important part of the human experience and I was depriving myself of growth that’d help me deal with that pain on my own. Now that I have, I can embrace scary things. It’s awesome! I started golfing, playing guitar more, my relationships improved. Maybe one day I’ll slip but I know that a sober me is the best me and I have the proof now if I ever doubt it again.

Side note I went to an online rehab. Idk if this is allowed but I used an online outpatient program and it helped immensely. I went from wake and bake and smoke through the day until bed to clean! I couldn’t have done it without help. I was lucky enough that insurance covered it but if you don’t have that there are programs that have some weekly meetings you can check out for free.

Wishing you all the best. It’s possible. I remember lurking and reading stories and trying and failing over and over but it finally stuck. Here’s to the future that we all can achieve!",15

And it's so frustrating because I'm an extremely ambitious and hard working person: I want to do more. So when I enter my state of fatigue I feel depressed, angry, and ashamed.

Especially when you molded your entire life and friend group around the ability and accessibility of smoking. However I would say it’s definitely worth it. 70 days later I’m better than I was in those first few weeks. I have my appetite back. I am able to sleep a full night and have dreams again (which was very strange at first you almost forget about them after you’ve smoked for so long). I’ve found a renewed interest in my hobbies and have even gotten some new ones. You just have to keep a mindset that it will get better and keep the belief as hard as it gets.

In my first week or so I had little to no cravings but since then I have been battling the urges. Recently, I started sifting through my carpet trying to find any small amount of weed I could which is super humiliating to admit on here but at least it will give you a sense of how strong my addiction is. I found a very, very small amount of bud (way less than 0.1g) and tried rolling it up in a small Rizla. Once I lit it, it tasted awful and basically just set on fire so I put it out after one drag. 

This mainly happened because my girlfriend was in the office and she is usually my rock when it comes to sobriety.

I did not get any sort of high from it, just tasted like cigarette. My question is if this counts as a relapse? I ask because I agreed I would tell my girlfriend if I ever relapsed and she still is counting the days I have been sober and celebrating them on my behalf.",2

Yesterday was day 1 and I don't think I can physically put myself through that anymore. Doing a full day's work on ZERO sleep while drifting in and out of panic attacks was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Honest to god when I left the house for work, a mini thought crossed my mind about throwing myself off a bridge. Why? Because being up 36 hours makes us think in an irrational manner. I've been through day 1 so many times that I'm just exhausted. 

Last night the dreams, shakes and sweats started.   

Next time I'm tempted, I'm simply going to remind myself that sleep is required for my mental health.   

I can see why people do harm themselves at breaking point. When you're that lost and sleep deprived, things can get really dark and scary fast.   

So for me drugs = bad sleep = depression and suicidal thoughts. That's not a game I can physically play anymore.   

I'm inclined to think that kindling also applies to cannabis. The notion that, no matter how long you are sober for, picking up again takes you straight back to where you were. The brain learns the trauma and ups the withdrawal symptoms (for protection I guess)",19

If you find yourself repeating the behavior you’re trying to stop, try not to get down on yourself! Instead, use the slip-up as an opportunity to explore what led to the behavior in the first place.

What triggers your habit? When does it happen? How do you feel afterwards? Ask yourself questions that focus on the now and in the future. I read this in a post here and it was brilliant for my success. I cannot share this enough.

It’s still not easy some days but if I look back at the first two weeks (especially week one days 4-6) I feel much better. I’m not trying to focus on the best stories here being my own. I set this expectation so I can achieve success on my own. This is how I know this time will be the one.

Recently I decided to quit weed entirely since I’ve noticed substantial side effects and just overall lower quality of life. I managed to go 3 weeks without any use but then I started having vivid dreams and really intense nightmares so I got scared and decided to take an edible so I wouldn’t dream. Worst decision ever. I know tolerence resets and all but I didn’t realize just how bad this would be. I ate a 20mg edible and was full on tripped out. Nothing felt real and I was in an alien world and hallucinating fractals and geometry badly. All I could do was wait it out. I’ve had bad trips on edibles before but this caught me completely off guard. Nevertheless I plan on quitting entirely again and never touching thc again especially after what I just went through. Felt like pure horror. I just want some advice and feedback on this because this is my first time quitting for a long time in my 3-4 years of use. I didn’t use weed too heavily but averaged around a gram smoked a day. The dreams were just really disturbing and I didn’t feel any different at all after quitting. Let me know your thoughts,2

I'm currently 12 days sober. My addiction messed up my life in different ways but the one I'm hurting over the most right now is the fact that I might've fucked my romantic relationship for good. 

My ex GF found out I was using again and she walked out on me. I lied to her face about it a week before and that was the final straw for her. We still had contact because she thinks she might still want a relationship but she wants a significant break for us to better ourselves. I totally agree with this and I've been making some significant changes to My life regarding health and temptations. 

However I felt like the fact that we were still talking was really holding me back. That was something I didn't want to admit to myself because I'm scared that it will make her lose interest in me entirely. Also she is the only form of support I had. I'm currently on a waiting list for treatment but I don't know how long that will take. And I also went to an online MA meeting yesterday btw and that helped me a bit. 

However, because I felt like our contact wasn't helping me we decided to go NC for a while. We just had this conversation I still stand by this decision but it hurts like hell. I want to do now is go to my favourite coffeeshop and try to forget about all of this. I know I don't really want to do it but right now it seems better than the alternative. I keep reminding myself that My brain can't accept that long term benefits are, in fact, better than the short term 'benefits' but it's hard.

I don't want to tempt fate but I feel like I've finally got past the worst stage of night sweats, insomnia and generally being more emotional and irrational than I'd like to be.

One thing that's definitely helped me this time is prayer, when I first posted here someone suggested I try praying to the plant and being open with how I've abused it, while I didn't exactly pray to the plant (being religious) I did pray about it which helped me work through the conflicted feelings about it and build up my conviction to never smoke again.

I'd definitely recommend praying if you're religious, or meditating on the issue if you're not.

It’s 7am where i live and im currently lying in a hospital bed inhaling oxygen to help my asthma as i was really struggling to breath. Smoking weed wasn’t helping my lungs one bit and i found it made me feel congested alot of the time if i smoked it consistently. I should be in my peak physical form at 21 but instead im lying in a hospital bed relying on a machine to function properly.

But whilst im sat here, I’ve had alot of time to reflect. I look back at the past 3 years of my life and i can honestly say that the happiest points was when i was improving myself and making fun memories with the with the people I care about. Although  some people can do these things whilst high. I can not. Im not productive when im stoned and i can’t create memories as im always too stoned to form these memories. 

We are all in this forum for a reason. And that reason is because deep down we know that weed doesn’t truly make us happy or satisfy our needs. Weed is the easy road that leads you to no where. Im done taking the easy road. My plan is to start 2022 being one month free of the green so I have a good reason to celebrate the new year. 

I will not wait for the new years resolutions to change my life. Better to start the year one step ahead. Its now or never.",32

I took my first toke age 17. I was immediately hooked. I loved how I could escape from life and from that point on, I told myself that I can't manage without it. Smoking weed became my identity and my whole life.

Fast forward 26 years to August 22, 2021. Now 43 years old, I'm finally ready to grow up and start living. 

Today, 100 days on, and I've achieved something that for most of my life, I literally didn't think was possible. And the funny thing is, once I committed fully to making this change, it was easier than I thought it would be. (Not easy, but not impossible as I imagined.)

Since quitting pot I’ve been struggling more so than usual with worrisome and paranoid thoughts. For example: excessive worry about getting sick, leaving the stove on, not locking the door. My anxiety that I have always had but generally has come and gone, has been consistantly around. It’s been harder to sleep, and harder to get out of bed. It’s hard to get motivated. My dreams are also still for lack of a better word, insane, and vivid.

Before quitting I smoked pot daily for 8+ years, I have also always struggled with mental health issues but have been better with coping as I got older and treatment.

I’m wondering, after all this time can quitting marijuana still be affecting my mental health? Can my brain still be adjusting, or is my mental health taking a huge dump on me likely unrelated?
I find myself wondering if things would be easier if I started using again.

To preface, I love my family, and my job, and my situation. I lead a truly lucky life as a 28 year old man making 43k a year in a job with a company that has values that match mine very thoroughly. I love my wife more than anything, and she is the light of my life. We have almost no arguments that I would consider anything close to major, at least not these days. 

But, she pointed out to me last night that I have been distant. I come home from work and immediately distract myself with whatever I can latch onto, whether it's games or TV or whatever else. I realize that weed kinda kept me in a state of constant distraction from my problems, and when I did step outside that bubble of staying high all the time I stepped right into the pile of shit that is my bad temper and tendency to overthink. I don't mistreat my wife, I just... ignore her, it seems. She says I do it every year around the holidays.  

Any suggestions for dealing with life outside of 'the bubble' when things start to get hard? Everything seems so much brighter, but after this S.A.D. starting setting in I feel so hopeless. I know the easy answer is 'just spend time with your wife, man' but something is keeping me from stepping outside of this new bubble I'm living in.... Avoiding life, I guess.

Wanted to weigh in with some positive insights for you all,"I've got 12 days under my belt and tomorrow will be uncharted territory for me in all of my adult life after consuming weed for 20+ years. I also quit drinking so I'm sober as a gopher. 

Here are my insights from my experience so far: the good and the bad. 

The Bad- 

Stomach has not felt quite right since I quit although I will say that's rapidly improving. Especially after getting some nutritional advice (bone broth and ginger chews are life savers.) I have been more irritable and will have moments of feeling overwhelmed and upset. Also feeling a lot more lonely without Mary Jane to coddle and distract me during these cold winter eves. Sleep has been disrupted badly but I finally stopped having night sweats as of two days ago and now the quality of rest I'm experiencing is far greater and I need way less sleep. 

&#x200B;

The Good- 

I actually feel like I should re-title this heading the Great because I feel fucking amazing waking up in the morning and my levels of motivation and mental focus have increased massively. I feel much more confident as well. The qualitative experience of the way I spend my time has radically improved also. I'm no longer feeling as though, whatever I do, I'm always kind of just waiting to go home and get high. My dopamine receptors were thrown off for a week or two but now I feel like I'm being rewarded for my hard work by feeling a much more subtle yet deeper sense of appreciation for the activities I partake in everyday. Even simple things like completing tasks at work or going to the post office are more enjoyable. I feel as though I am moving from the realm of gross sensation (think- loud, fast, flashy and shiny) to the realm of the subtle (quiet, still, peaceful, and exquisite.) That's not to say I don't appreciate loud music and bold colors, in fact I am feeling that I appreciate them very much more, it's just that I don't need to be hammered over the head to feel something. 

This is still a huge challenge for me, and I anticipate there will be tough times ahead and waves of dissatisfaction and difficulty but that's life and overall my trajectory is unmistakably moving upwards and forwards. I hope this helps to hear for anyone of you who are seeking a bit of added motivation as reading people's posts on this subreddit has been huuuge for me in that regard. 

Wasn't sure that I could do this.. but I can and it feels damn good! Respect to all of you on your paths.",57

Started off casual, but became more and more dependent on it. Then I used it to make me happy or medicate myself. It got worse and worse. I decided to quit, but it would never last. The struggle was real. April 1st, 2020 I finally decided it was enough. I was disgusted with myself. The lowest I ever felt. I finally stopped. A couple of days became a week. A week became a month. And so on and so on. I was still so focused on how disappointed I was in my past with my smoking and was hoping for the future to where I felt 100% that I never treasured the present. I couldn’t stop smoking for more than a couple days and here I was not enjoying my achievements of my sobriety. Today is honestly the first day I stopped and realized I need to work on more than just being sober on weed. All the paws I felt have gone away except for fatigue and brain fog. The brain fog is still pretty thick and fatigue can be tough. I would spend hours scrolling thru others peoples posts and looking up how weed can cause these problems and searched to see how long it would take to go away. There’s others factors in my life that could be causing the brain fog n fatigue tho. Depression. The way I eat. Caffeine intake. Drinking. I need to stop letting weed destroy me. Sure I stopped for 20 months, but I’m still obsessed with what it has done to me. No longer. Im still not gonna smoke, but also going to cut out caffeine. Eliminate my drinking. Eat better. Work on my mental and physical health. I wish when I hit all my other monthly sobriety anniversaries I took time to be proud of myself, but it’s ok bc I’m starting now. I’m going to let got of my obsession on what weed has done to me and be appreciative of what I have now. All the blessings I have. I will be 100% one day. It isn’t now, but that’s ok bc I’ll be working on myself to be better every day. If you’re struggling or worried, it’s fine, but don’t let it consume you. Try to find the positive things in your life and have the confidence that you will be better. Good luck everyone with your journeys. We got this!",20

I have been reluctant to posting on here but wanted to really make it with breaking this happen. 

Background, I started smoking when I was about 16. My parents were not the best so it became something I could do to distract myself from home stress and drama. It got gradually worse as my tolerance increase until it became just a staple or precursor to any and everything I did. 

Want to sleep? Let’s smoke
Start my day? Smoke
Eat lunch? First roll up
Need a smoke? Sure but first smoke

I recently managed to land a great job. I stopped smoking for the interview. It took a long time but eventually I got the callback. Hence my 3 day sober binge. However, undoubtedly the stress and nerves of a new job has me a bit on edge. So my carvings are getting bad. 

Does anyone have advice on how to help with the urges?

Thanks in advance",1

I started smoking when I was 14. I played a lot of sports in high school and weed wasn’t easy to get, but I still smoked 1-2 times per week most weeks. 

In my 20’s I did landscaping and we would smoke most days on the job. Weed was easy enough to find at this point, but lack of money kept things in check I think. 

For the last 10 years though, once dispensaries started to open, I became a daily smoker. 

I never thought weed was a big deal (for me).  I could still do everything I needed to do. I had stoner friends that were fun. I finished college and have a career in IT. I was active and healthy. I could quit anytime, if I wanted to…
Until I actually wanted to. 

When my son was born 5 years ago I said to myself, time to get serious and stop. I didn’t though. I felt like it was ok on occasion as long as I was being responsible. 

In the last 5 years I have been smoking pretty heavily (multiple times a day every day).I have taken breaks in the past to study for IT certifications, but it sucked. I used alcohol to help with sleeping, which has been my biggest problem. 
 
I wanted to quit last year, I was exercising regularly, studying, eating better, etc and then COVID happened. I thought it would go away faster and took it as time for vacation. Working from home meant smoking all day. 

I tossed out my bong this year, got a Dynavap M, then got a K-safe (which really helps me wait til after work).

Then in September I got COVID. I felt like I was going to die. It really made me think about my life. But, I still kept smoking, even while sick. 

Anyway, I think I really do want to quit. It’s going to be hard. I want to light one up and relax right now.  I don’t want to spend $5000-$7000 a year on dispensary weed. I don’t want to eat snacks and junk all day. I want my lungs to be healthy. I want to be a good dad to my kids. 

I’ll be seeing friends and family for Xmas that will want to smoke. I don’t know if I can say no. I’m trying to cut back on alcohol, too.",3

It upsets me that I ""need"" weed to ""fix myself"", and wonder how I'm going to get through without it in the long run.

When I tried to quit last time, I made it 13 days. The time before that, 9 days.  


I think I realized that I don't a real way to slow down and have some fun with others. I have lovely memories walking around campus or my town at 3am with my buddies, passing around a pen or a joint, as we talked about our lives, our friendship. Now, I don't have that, and I was desperate to relive it. Weed brought me back until I got sober and found myself covered in junk food crumbs, alone in my apartment. I am stressed over what the future holds, and so I did what I could to push it under the rug. 

&#x200B;

I had no way to have fun, real fun. Yeah, I have Minecraft and books, but I don't have a hobby. If it counted, I would have said my hobby was to get high and do household chores. I don't have ""the boys"" like I did at home. I have great friends here, but most weekend nights are spent at home. The days of just ""hanging out"" feel like they're over.   


I live with my SO, who hates weed. She would never call me out on it, I think she has the opinion that I'm an adult, and if I chose a bad habit, she can wish I stopped but can't tell me what to do either. I would smoke on my nightly dog walks, and I'd come back to her face. She said nothing, but I could tell by her face that she knew I was high. I didn't want her to smell me, so I would keep my distance. No snuggles on the couch, no long kisses, no hugs, all while she knew I tried to hide my habit. 

&#x200B;

Over this last year, a lot has happened. I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was fired from my last job for ""mediocre performance."" I worked a summer job where I'm pretty sure my boss and supervisors did not like me. They seemed great most of the summer. They were understanding when I got the call at work that my grandfather died or when I wanted to see my family for a few days. 

I called to put in my 2 weeks because I had a cold. I said that I could complete any work I had so I could leave without having them finish it for me. They insisted for me to just stop working instead of doing 2 more weeks. When I came in to collect my things, they had already packed it all for me in a cardboard box. No nice words were exchanged. I thanked everyone for the time and what I learned from them, and most of them said ""ok.""   


I felt like the world was casting judgment on me. My work bosses, my SO, my teachers, and my classmates. I wanted to hide and be by myself, and that meant sitting alone in my car, smoking till I could forget that fear. Until I was numb.   


That fear may not go away for a while, but smoking will only make it worse. I have to deal with it, as hard as it is. I just don't know if I'm strong enough to handle it.",2

She assumed I’d only take a hit or two at a time for pain, but of course I sucked it down in a week or two and then was left craving every day after.

Viewing it as an injury that needed to be healed allowed me to care for myself during the recovery period. Have patience with myself, give myself some grace and compassion. This was not a superficial injury and probably the most significant injury I'd ever had in my life. It was like I had paralyzed my mind and I needed to go through the PT to rehabilitate it.

In the early to mid 2010s I started getting serious about quitting weed and talk to a couple of different therapists. It was set in my mind that there must have been a cause, a good reason for my addiction to weed (and booze). If I could only find out why I started and continued then it would be easier to stop, right?

Two years and many therapy sessions later and I still didn't have the answer. I searched high and low, was it x or y from my childhood? Was this or that the cause? I didn't know, it didn't *feel* like those things were the cause of my using weed. I tried to stop a couple of times at this point but I guess I just wasn't ready, wasn't prepared enough, not determined enough. For the next almost 10 years I continued on, still asking myself the question of why along the way.

At some point before I quit I was reading, potentially on this very sub, that the why didn't matter. My situation was the same regardless of the reason why I was using weed. It didn't change the fact that I needed to quit and if there was a reason then maybe I can figure that out after I had stopped.

There were a lot of nudges that I needed to finally stop and this was one of them. I still don't know why I started and used weed for so long, and maybe I never will. Maybe there isn't a specific reason but just a bunch of things together that lead me down that path. I may never know, and that is okay.",13

Anyway, going off course, I know I need to quit for the above reasons but I'm very scared of withdrawals and how my mental health will be affected, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post but.... any advice would be greatly appreciate.",7

Looking back I never actually enjoyed it but felt like I should due to social pressure. At the beginning of quarantine last year I was smoking multiple times a day with my roommate. I felt like a lifeless shell of a human.
Today my therapist told me she was proud of me. I feel so much happier now that I’m not smoking with the same people doing the same old shit and having the same old conversations all the time. Quitting was the first step to me actually feeling content in life.",9

my shame
the fact that whenever i do something bad/wrong i don’t think, oh, i did something bad/wrong; but instead think i AM something bad/wrong

guilt is: oh fuck i did something bad
shame is: oh fuck i am bad

so that’s why when i do one slight bad thing, i internalize it and do more bad things instead of cleaning up the mess and picking up the pieces, i build on it and add more to the fire. 

this is also why my self talk is beating myself up a lot and being hard on myself. because that’s the voice of shame, it reaffirms the deficits. whereas guilt says “don’t worry you made a mistake but you don’t need to beat yourself up or continue to add to the mess, we can make amends and make things right”

shame says:” you are bad how did you let it get to this state you suck you are a failure you could be so much more, you have so much ways to go, you are inadequate”

notice how much easier to write for the shame column
see how the guilt column deflects blame away from the self and focuses on action/amends/ accountability

whereas shame internalizes the blame and becomes harsher than the mistake itself. this makes receiver feel inadequate and less capable to amend 

my shame is my bully, guilt would be my mentor. 

shame also shows up as:
“i give up”
“i can’t do this”
not trying your best - i’m bad/inadequate. if i fail i confirm this

this was just from my notes i thought it applies well to addiction and binging.",15

I don’t really have any healthy relationships.,"Kinda weird to realize. My relationship with weed isn’t healthy, I’m stoned and alone like all the time. Right now I have the first day of a new job in 6 hours and I’m up smoking. 

I also don’t really have a healthy relationship with any of my family or friends. They all like me and are good people, I am kind of caught up in my subjective experience of the world. I could have healthy relationships if I went for it, but I always afraid to actually try. Idk why. Just can’t seem to actually keep up with people and build a stable relationship, I just kinda refuse to reach out to anybody and just sit around stoned and alone. I used to go on walks in the park or drive around but my car doesn’t work anymore. 

Kinda prioritize being stoned and alone over anything else. Huh. Idk why I do that. Huh. I really do prioritize that as number one. Kind of unsettling to realize.",66

Im a few days clean now and just talking with my girlfriend over dinner about some things that had been weighing on me and started crying. Just some things I'd been carrying some real deep frustration about. I'm deeply in debt because of school. I'm kinda in a weird, not super well paid inbetween space in my career, etc. Its whatever. Its all manageable but it also hurts. I havent been letting myself feel that hurt fully for so long and then it all comes out at once. It felt so good to finally just cry and say that I'm hurting and that thats ok instead of wrapping myself in a weed blanket so thick I don't feel the pain but also I don't feel ANYTHING. Anyway. Grateful for this community and the relief of just letting things hurt so one day they can hurt less. Keep on keepin on gang",9

That someone somewhere in the world is making money out of your addiction.   

Whether it be weed, alcohol, caffeine or pornography.   

Someone somewhere out there is making profit from your misery - your inability to stop using something that hijacks your own reward system that you were inevitably born with.   

Once you've come to this realisation, like I just have, take a moment to breathe in, breathe out and realise this has to stop now.   

Wishing you all well on your journey.",31

I just recently quit smoking weed after around 4 years of heavy use. I have also quit nicotine which I used off an on for around 2 years, but was doing more recently. I have also stopped drinking coffee after a couple months of heavy use so just going through a lot of detox at the moment. Just wanted to see if people had any tips for withdrawals and staying strong. Feeling pretty moody and down with a lot of brain fog which sounds normal, but just wanting to see if others had this. Just feeling out of it, anxious, depressed and little serotonin on a daily basis. Getting better day by day and I’m around 2 weeks in, but it is pretty tough at times. Just wanting to see when people felt a break though and if my symptoms relate to others who went through this. Thanks!",25
