When I was 18, I lost every friend and was isolated at my parents house  for a year.  I went to college at 19 and made friends who smoked, and that's how I started. 

I've gone thru different friends, but a core theme to me staying friends with people was always... Well we smoked. It was the thing we bonded over, while doing whatever else. Most people I know or used to know smoked. 

Even now, pretty much only one person I know I hang with who doesn't smoke , ironically also probably the person who is doing the best for himself.

My best friend smokes and he will never stop, I know this. He doesn't have such a problem with it, it doesn't affect his life as negatively as it does me. Whenever I hang with him, his brother and that entire group, we pretty much always smoke. And I've tried before to just decide well I'm not smoking. And they honestly aren't peerpresuring. But time and time again when I hang with them, if I don't smoke, I just see them do it, and I end up doing it.

They're not toxic people or anything, I don't want to cut them out, but at the same time, it's almost like I feel I don't know what I'm doing there unless I smoke with them.

September 23rd I decided to stop smoking after a couple years of non stop smoking. I checked myself into a php/IOP program, Tommorow I am stepping down to OP. In my opinion weed is addictive for me at least, I also believe that people who say they smoke weed because it’s good for them or for health purposes is just a false belief that enables them to keep smoking. Weed is a powerful substance that it is possible to become dependent on which is not the case for everyone but was for me. I had actual withdrawals from weed. Quitting weed made me realize how expensive this habit was and also how much it destroyed my memory and brain functions, around 30 days sober my brain function improved and around day 70 my emotions were more stable and it’s still a process coming up on 100 days but with the proper support in my life I pray that I can keep going. I hope that anyone who wants to quit can do so successfully and also have the power to improve themselves so that you can not be sober and miserable.

I’ve come to terms with the fact that I have an addiction to smoking weed and I need help. After finding this sub and reading through a few of your posts, I’ve been inspired to reach out to you all.

I started smoking when I was 12, and I have always seemed to use it as a crutch for depression and self confidence (such as the classic ‘I would put myself out there but I’ll just get high instead and not try in case I fail’) but now I’m 25 and I need to start dealing with my problem.

I have a full time job and an SO that I’ve been with for 3 years now, but I’ve unfortunately dragged her down with me and we usually spend the vast majority of our time and money up in smoke. We’ve managed to cut out everything else, but this monkey won’t budge.

This is my 6th sober day since October 9th, which was only because we were out of the country on holiday. We’ve been at our parents houses for the holidays since Christmas Eve, but tomorrow we’ll be travelling back home. Where we live is extremely liberal when it comes to drugs, and you can get anything in 20 minutes almost any time of day without having to leave your home. Sounds like a dream right? A nightmare when trying to stay sober.

My first port of call is to bin my box containing all my gear and rolling tray with smokable scraps. But this won’t stop me from potentially losing my metal, sending a text and throwing away these 6 days of sobriety.

Any advice or coping techniques are welcome. I’m terrified. My SO is with me on this, but we’re just as bad as each other.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9773443341255188}"

Last night I thought I’d make a special one-off occasion of taking a small dose of edible and seeing CATS. Friends, that movie is a horror show, but a future camp classic. I had a fun time.

Part of me is a little down about straying from my new weed-free experience. I’m not sure I regret it if I’m being honest, but I’m glad I only did the small amount that I did, which would not have been the case 7 months ago. I could sense the undercurrent of bad feelings that are way, way out of control when I frequently used... but there was also lots of laughs and giggles. Still, a harbinger of why I quit reared its head.

It hasn’t really made me reconsider my path, I don’t really plan on becoming an “occasional” user now. It felt less of a transgression just based on how I react to edibles and how I’m still without having smoked, my true stoner vice. 

But I guess now I just have to deal with the challenge of not having such an impressive streak to maintain and just sticking to it because I know it’s better for me in the long run. A slippery slope... I need to keep monitoring this.

Perhaps a better conclusion: I don’t regret it... yet. If it signals a return to my old ways, I’m sure as hell going to regret it.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9582958817481995}"

Plan was to stop on the 1st of Jan but something happened boxing day. My dealer was slow getting back to me. Never stopped me in the past but something just clicked. I didn't want to do that desperate scramble like I had so many times. If I couldn't do this now how the fuck was I going to in a few more days. 

I'm doing so much positive stuff. I've been attending NA for a few weeks now, yesterday was my first meeting actually being clean and fuck that felt good. Not sitting there with that shame. I volunteered at a homeless shelter on xmas day. That was incredibly rewarding and maybe the thing that made me have that last smoke xmas day. I've started both BJJ and running again (each one gets quicker since stopping!) I've got involved with coaching a youth sports team and just all round trying to get more involved in community minded things after closing myself off for so many years.

Nights are tough but they're getting better. I'm utterly absorbing myself in The Witcher (show/books/game) so lets all have a second to appreciate that dreamy boi Henry!!

Mornings on the other hand are amazing! Days actually feel connected instead of each one just being a case of getting through it. It's like I'm actually working with myself from the day before. I don't have to come up with a brand new plan to ""fix it"". This one is working and it's getting momentum every day. 

Anyway on to why I'm actually writing this. Well to be honest actually getting all that out has made me feel a little better but I just found out my date for tomorrow cancelled on me. I feel like that voice will be back tomorrow nagging away at me. 

UK based so it's getting late for me now so I'm not even gonna give it anymore thought tonight. Gonna get my Witcher on and let that positive version of me sort it out in the morning (having a plan for the day helps me a lot). 

I apologise that this probably reads awfully. It ended up coming out way different than I planned it. I would really appreciate waking up tomorrow to some positive messages.

It wasn't soon before I was using it daily. I could justify it at first because it helped me be very productive - I could do chores on end because they didn't feel as boring any more. I also felt I could think very creatively and it helped put many pieces of my disorganized mind together. It really felt like a cure-all and was a central part of how I came to a diagnosis of ADHD which had always effected me. 

Like many others, I started to use heavily - I justified my liberal use of it with it's plausible therapuetic potential, though a part of me knew I was using it more than I actually needed to. At the same time, I started to receive treatment for my ADHD with CBT and medication. I was suspicious of the interaction between pot and methylphenidate, and that sweet dopamine  - I never deliberately decided to mix these substances for the purposes of pleasure, but I could feel the interaction. Over time, I noticed increasing variability in my mood. I almost solely attributed it to my new diagnosis, which made me frustrated and reinforced my self-medicating with weed.

Without being too verbose, I find myself in a position where I simply feel like I'm stuck. I have adopted many new CBT techniques, new outlooks and coping mechanisms, however I feel like I'm spinning my wheels. My motivation is waxing and waning, my ability to concentrate feels more variable, I lack an appetite, I am frequently nauseas, my memory is shot after heavy nights smoking, and a general feeling of inconsistency.

I bought my first eighth for 20 dollars, brick swag. Me and a buddie decided were gunna see what all the hype is about. But wait how are we even gunna smoke it? I had some of those pink hall passes in my wallet from school so I tried my best and rolled that shit up in those. Terrible first joint, it was actual paper tasted like shit but somehow we got baked as fuck. Talked to my brother and he rolled me few real joints. I have been smoking like a chimney since. Played football, wrestled, baseball had decent grades. I had a rough upbringing. Both my parents were addicted to meth I went to foster care when I was 7 because my dad went to prison and my mom went to jail. My brother was in a group home already, my mom got out of jail I got to go home for 2 weeks then she failed her drug test and i never got to go back again. Ended up getting adopted in the same small town of 302 people as my biological parents lived. But couldn't have any contact. My dad was a badass because of his drug lord status and cooking the best meth around. Woo hoo. That's what I had to be proud of. I had it in my head from very young doing drugs is the cool thing to do. So as soon as smoked that first joint it was over. Quit sports skipped classes didn't care about shit. My adoptive parents were strict as hell, I hated them. Would of rather lived with my drug addicted parents. When I was 16 I met the girl of my dreams. Somehow I just knew. I really did. I ran away from my adoptive parents when they were going to put me in a group home till I was 18. Literally punched through a window and split my hand open and got away from the cop that she had called. I was a runaway so I couldn't get a real job till I was 18, so I sold weed. After the heat died down I moved back in with my biological mom and sold weed out of a 1 bedroom tiny ass apartment. Smoked out daily, somehow my wonderful girlfriend stayed with me through all the shit.

There is a whole bunch of shit from then to now that I could write a novel, but I wont. 2 years ago I applied for a job way the fuck out of my league and somehow I got it. Easy mouth swab drug test to pass and then I was set. I am fucking pothead superintendent at a fortune 300 company. I got an email a week ago we will now start piss testing randomly. I am not going to lose this job over fucking pot. 5 days ago I gathered all of my pot and pot accessories together through it in a giant fucking tub and gave it all to my friends. I fucking loved pot. Thought I would smoke till the day I died. 5 days sober. 5 days. THAT FIRE DEEP INSIDE ME IS BACK. IT NEVER FUCKING WENT AWAY. It's still in all of us. I WILL fucking be somebody and I wont be contained into a small fucking sliver of life again. Never. 5 days ago I loved pot. Today I fucking hate it. I've come to realization of what it has held back from me in 5 days and for the last 13 years it has blinded me. That girlfriend of mine? Somehow today she is still with me. I've spent so much fucking money on pot I couldn't even have the decency to save to buy her a ring. FUCK THAT. I'm gunna buy her a ring as soon as possible and one that she fucking deserves.

I hit 2 weeks today, the longest I have gone without being high in well over a year. To be honest I am proud and surprised I haven’t done it yet. I’ve been around many friends doing it and have had to say NO half a dozen times to people who know how much I smoked (vaped actually). 

Anyways, I’m not writing this post to toot my own horn I am doing it to give my advice on what helped me.

Like type a google doc of everything u want to do/have to do/and can do in your day; from working to being with friends, to walking ur dog, to playing video games, to reading, sleeping, showering, working out, driving around, etc. Just everything u can think of. Then print this list out and use it as a “guide.”

For me the hardest thing was to fill the time I spent high all day watching YT for 8-12 hours a day lmao. So like I said keeping busy is the #1 thing making this way easier.

I had the worst kind of withdrawals, insomnia, sweating like a horse, no appetite but continuos hunger, etc, you get it. I knew I had to do it, I knew I had to stick to it this time. After I went through this hellish first phase, I quit my no-future-whatsoever Ph.D., enrolled in a programming summer Bootcamp. I completed it in November. Before the final exam, I had been feeling very strange, kind of unwell. I was always thirsty, had a lot of leg cramps. I went to check my blood sugar levels, the meter topped off at 600mg/dl. Turned out I have type I diabetes. I was immediately admitted to the hospital. Since then I'm writing some blogs about diabetes to vent, check out one of my latest if you are interested:  [https://medium.com/@diabetes.commun/how-to-drink-safely-with-diabetes-on-new-years-eve-3755c4bf0383](https://medium.com/@diabetes.commun/how-to-drink-safely-with-diabetes-on-new-years-eve-3755c4bf0383) But this tour to the hospital and a life long chronic illness didn't stop me. I finished that Bootcamp, and I already have an entry-level job in my new field. Nothing special, and I get minimum wage because I'm a beginner, but I feel like I'm on the right path now. What would have happened if I continued smoking weed? Could I change my career path? Could I recognize the signs of diabetes in time? Maybe not. What would have happened to me if I had to be admitted to the hospital high as fuck? It would have been a disaster I guess. I'm so glad, that I stopped this horrible cycle called smoking weed in time. I turned my life upside down for the better, could never do it with weed.

I smoked heavily from 17+ and off and on until now, 34 years old. I would say in the last 10 years I have found myself smoking atleast 3+ times a week sometimes heavier sometimes lighter. I don't really enjoy being high as I did when I was younger, but what I DO like from using Heavy CBD/ light THC is that it seems to give me concentration/motivation for the 2-3 hours I am high (until I start to burn out).   So what's shitty is that outside of the weed, I have a very hard time motivating myself to do creative things (sometimes to even play video games).  I will give some other examples... I can sit down and program my passion projects outside of word (I am a gave dev / software dev), I can write music, draw, and be generally productive while I am high. I tolerate some of the side of effects of weed because it gives me this motivation....  My question is, will the motivation come back if I quit weed - because I don't even really enjoy the high anymore, just the motivation kick. I honestly seem to always remember weed bringing some excitement to my life, but I really wonder if while bringing some excitement, it also started to remove my motivation day to day and I never noticed it after 20 years.  I am the type of person who gets really lifted and alert/awake when I get high, not drowsy (unless burning out).  I guess I am just sort of in a limbo in my mind on whether or not it's weed that has killed my day to day excitement about activities, or if I have always been like this and weed just makes me enjoy some activities? I know this is a pro weed but also pro quitting sub. I have quit weed in the past, but I don't recall huge productive periods...  That's also an issue. I have visual aphantasia and I have a really terrible auto biographical memory of things. I've come to a point in my life where I don't really remember my past state of motivation and if being off weed for a long period of time would bring me back to a level where I can be productive outside of pot.  Anyways, if anyone has any experience quitting and sounds like they had similar issues I had, I'd love a response.    I know the post is a bit scattered but the TLDR is...   Been off and on, heavy - moderate smoker for 15+ years, I don't know if weed has taken my day to day motivation or not, it seems to be the only source of motivation I have now (while im high) other than outside motivations.   My life is not bad, I write code for a living, write games and cool software projects and I am a productive employee, it's just that my life outside of work lacks motivation.

I’m a college student/working man coming here from another subreddit mention (great outreach). I use weed 100% as an emotional escape and have done so daily for a couple years. It didn’t start that way but it certainly transpired in that fashion. When I’m not high, it’s very easy for me to over think my life and become disaccoicated. I have a great family and a great life but just can’t seem to feel happy. I’m unsure if greater mental problems are the root but weed just takes all those problems away. The process and subsequent events of following smoking is so therapeutic that it grounds me. It makes me wonder what separates me from someone using it medicinally. I am very active, liked by my peers, loved by my family, top performer at my job, and doing well in school but can’t seem to truly appreciate it. It seems weed brings out two personalities in me. Someone who is mellowed out and goes with the flow and someone who is afraid they may be running from some problem. When I’m with my family, on a bike, hiking down a mountain, or studying physics with my friends I can be 100% engaged in what I’m doing and loving life, sober or high. However, when I’m sober and by myself and not busy, my mind goes to the dark places and weed immediately relieves that (unless I smoke too much and get anxiety about why I’m smoking too much).

I'm sorry you may not understand, if you've not seen Mr. Robot to the end, or at all. But I'll try my best to convey how I connected.

Also, Spoiler alert!

Just as in the show, Elliot, the original Elliot, from problems in life creates a persona to escape/deal with those problems. So did I. But in my case, I used substances to create these other personas. Different substances made me feel different ways. Be more like what I can handle, what I'm comfortable with inorder to deal with different situations. Deep situations that I can't handle as my original self (my sober self) or just prefer not to. I created my best persona with weed. It was my most comfortable, happiest escape, and gradually I let this persona become me. It became me. It was a transformation. I had no problem with it because it's what I wanted. It was my escape, the same way mastermind Elliot was OG Elliot's.

But in my case, our case. The persona doesn't take over, we give it control. It does take over. Through substances, weed. 

But the problem is, it's still not the real us, the OG us. We need to stop giving up control, become fully in control again. For years the OG Elliot was never in full control, his created persona was. How long have you lost complete control for? How far locked away is the real you, and for how long? For us, the only way to get back that full complete control is to stop giving it up. Using these substances, weed is giving up control to a part of you you're more comfortable with. The longer the control is theirs, the harder it is for this new us to give back control. (Withdrawals/Dependencies)

Staying sober is taking back control. Returning to our OG self. It will take a long and painful confusing while to get back accustomed to our new life and move on, as it will, the OG Elliot. But at least it's our OG self. 

There's a speech at the ending that goes: 

As Mr. Robot (another persona of Elliot's in the show) says; ""We'll always be a part of Elliot Alderson. And we'll be the best part, because we're the part that always showed up. We're the part that stayed. We're the part that changed him. And who wouldn't be proud of that?"" 

The weed me is a part I'm leaving behind, it'll always be a part of me, my best part, it's the one that stayed. The part that changed me. I'm proud of that. I've grown. But it's just that. A part. It can't be the one in complete control. I should! I will! I am! 

Staying Sober releases our OG self.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9926566481590271}"

The temptation has only heightened recently because I am cat sitting for my brother.

I want to be able to do things for my own sake, like starting a reading habit or actually going out and being able to integrate with society, but because the medicine I smoke to negate my natural levels of anxiety only perpetuates my problems of integrating in the first place (and makes me stupid and lazy). So I just smoke and isolate myself because that's where I can have a glimpse into a life that is atleast numbed to the holes that life seems to punch into you.

2.Smoke untill I'm numb

I've been smoking regularly everyday for about 4 years now

All my friends smoke daily as well 

I don't know how to find the strength/courage to quit smoking weed. It's starting to worry me, as recently . I've been noticing my short term memory getting worse and worse as time goes on. I'm a  college student as well and currently I'm still able to get straight A's but i highly doubt I'll be able to maintain my grades if i keep my smoking habit up cause I'm destroying my short term memory. Like for example ill go downstairs to grab a bottle of water and when i get down stairs literally 10 seconds later i have completely forgotten what i was doing. like something like that will happen a handful of times a day.  

I just feel hilariously frustrated with myself because i know I'm voluntarily destroying my brain. I can't find the mental strength in me to resist the temptation of smoking weed. You guys know how it is. Coming home to a dab pen and a packed bong after a long day is one of the best feelings in the world. It's like you're instantly relaxed. You couldn't give a shit how tired/fried you were feeling 30 seconds ago after taking the first rip. 

I think that's my problem. Feeling like I couldn't give a shit about anything in the world, whenever i wanted, is the best feeling, and that's how weed makes me feel.  Like i could not see myself not smoking fat  after a 6 hour calculus 2 study binge.

I’m only 20 and I’m sure you’ve heard it all before but hear me out. I started smoking junior year of high school basically whenever I had the cash or a friend had a joint before school. Fast forward to about a year and a half ago when I was gearing up to join the navy so I quit for about 4 months on and off before I went, peeing clean, and then got separated 2 months later for medical separation. When I got back I got a job at a production factory that let you smoke weed making 16/hr with benefits but you had to have a medical card so I bought one. At that time and currently, my diet went to about a meal a day MAYBE two, dropped about 20 pounds, bad bad back aches which I attribute to the lack of nutrition, can’t sleep without being high, and I often find myself fighting to urge to smoke right after I get off work. Currently since I’ve had the card I’ve been smoking non stop for about a year 2-3 grams a day, a cart a week (for bedtime when I was too lazy to clear and load a bowl) and it seems like every time I say I’m gonna quit I get weak willed near bedtime when the boredom and insomnia kick in and end up folding every time. I know the clarity will follow after a couple weeks but it just seems like it’s so much harder to quit this time and I justify it because I’m in school and am making productive steps in life so I reassure myself that I’m not being severely HINDERED but it definitely is limiting me and I know I’d be better financially and physically without it.  I’m pretty much buying a half ounce every other week, sacrificing groceries and ANYthing recreational for weed money. I know it’s not a huge deal the college pothead but I really don’t want to keep this lifestyle and I don’t know how to quit, any tips or advice would help greatly /:

For context, I smoked daily for 9 years, age 18-27. Also was a cigarette smoker. After a near car accident & separate physical energy (I passed out and hit my head on a door), I stopped smoking weed on 12/28/2014. Had to make excuses with smoking buddies and ghosted one for a solid year while I struggled to stay clean, but we’ve since reconnected and hang out without drugs. After one year off MJ I quit cigarettes, and just marked four years off the death sticks.

My life has improved substantially without the crutch of weed yet I still struggle with dating & food/exercise issues that I was smoking to prolong dealing with. It may be the holidays & frequent social events but I’ve been drinking a fair amount lately. Rarely alone and never early or even to excess but it’s something I’d like to cut back on as the new year begins.

Actually I've spend the past couple getting my shit in order (mostly sober - at that point drinking was more of a problem) and am in a much better place now. 

HOWEVER, I'm finding that even when I work my ass off to keep my life together, I end up doing something every couple of months or so out of sheer fucking boredom. I really think this has to do with me not being able to get out of my head/body once in a while. I do exercise daily, have developed pretty solid coping mechanisms, am thrilled with my job, have a good relationship and a great pet. So it's not the same horrible underlying issues that were driving this behavior before.

Like I said though, I get bored out of my fucking mind - this wasn't something I was even aware of when I was stoned all the time or even when I was trying to be sober (but not actively improving any aspects of my life). I've been diagnosed with ADHD before but am unmedicated because I hate the side effects of ADD meds. What happens is I'll get this way over the course of a month or two, smoke out of boredom, then stay high for a week on carts. It gets extremely boring and repetitive after the first few days but I find I'm unable to stop. At around the week mark though I'm barely getting high anymore so I force myself to stop. The withdrawals can be brutal in that I don't sleep for days during them, but...

I come out of them feeling completely reset mentally, emotionally and creatively. It's like all the residual shit that I haven't been able to deal with with conscious coping mechanisms gets flushed out. Problem is, I can't control my behavior as well as I'd like (I can't put aside essentially two weeks to binge and recover/feel like shit - the sleep deprivation gets insane, like 72 hours with no sleep) and I hate wasting so much time when I'm high. For what it's worth, I don't get any of these positive effects using CBD and for some reason regular bud makes me very anxious now so it's carts or nothing.

I got into weed at a point in my life where I was barreling toward rock bottom: everything was terrible in my life when I got addicted. Now everything is looking up, and for once this substance has potential to enhance my life, but I don't know how to make it work.

2019-12-28 15:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/egvoc6/dont_quit_without_a_plan/,Don't quit without a plan!,"Hey guys I've been a daily user for over 10 years. Tried to quit multiple times but seem to have found a good system to keep me on tract. I've learned quite a bit from my past failed attempts at quitting and just wanted to share some of the things that are really helping me out this time around.

I'm not going to get into what is the absolute priority or anything like that just list them all out as the degree of importance is going to vary between individuals.

Whenever I tried to quit I would dread the coming insomnia and lack of appetite, as well as how easily agitated I would get. This time around I make sure that everyday I try to get in a hard workout that leaves me huffing and puffing. That release of endorphins is a much better natural alternative (for obvious reasons) than smoking. But that alone is not enough as my mind races throughout the night if that's all I do, even though it really does help with excessive tossing and turning at night.

This time around I've also added brain training type games (for me it's through phone apps) that tend to exhaust my mind and it has definitely helped me accelerate out of that mind fog. On top of that I realize some sort of sleeping emphasized guided meditations really put my mind at ease.

Making a checklist (real or mental) of things to get done also greatly helps. If you were like me you had all these things you would get around to when you quit weed. Well now is the time to actually do it. No more putting it off. Get started now.

Get rid of all your paraphernalia. No more pipes, bongs, rollies, grinders, dab rigs. Get rid of it all. No temptations. 

Just know that quitting for real involves a LIFETIME of vigilance. Don't let your guard down. After a month, 3 months, year, 5 years. It doesn't mean you can just take a hit at a party and it'll be okay because you don't own any equipment and you won't fall back into it. YOU WILL DON'T KID YOURSELF. If you are frequenting this sub it probably means you have a certain addictive personality and you need not forget that.

Idle time is the devil's plaything as they say. If you don't fill up your day with things to do/learn/practice/read/play then you will think about weed and how you miss it. Don't kid yourself and say weed doesn't work like it used too or anything like that as a reason for stopping. Drugs will always do what you want them to do. You aren't the type of person that can handle the moderation so don't even think of it as an option ever.

True friends are going to be happy that you are making an effort to improve your life. Maybe you've been in the cannabis game for so long that you only have friends that also do cannabis, and all your outings include getting high first or getting high as the only activity. Well this is going to have to change. There are lots of other fun things to do other than to get high. There are lots of other ways to relax other than to get high. It's on you to find the healthy alternative. It's on you to go through the trial and error process of finding that healthy alternative. It's on you to formulate a plan of attack.

TLDR: exhaust both your mind and body everyday, fill your schedule with things, find alternative means of relaxation, lifetime of vigilance is what you are going to need to stay out.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9304638504981995}"

So here we go. I previously quit for six months and used this sub to help me out. I created my account that I am posting on now  76 days ago. I created it the first day i smoked again. I am now 2 and half months later depressed again and I quit working out, lost a ton of weight again that took me a 5-6 months to put on when I sobered up previously. 

Now let’s continue with my other issues about quitting. 

I am a legal medical marijuana grower. Many in my family are also legal medical marijuana farmers. I work everyday on the farm and everyday we all get together to smoke. I have to work in a few hours and I know that I’m going to be asked to hit the joint or dab or whatever comes my way. How do I get away from them I’ll never know. This is why I’m here posting. I truly believe that marijuana is an awesome plant and a great way to help people with chronic pain but I am not in any way shape or form in need of something to help with chronic pain or relief. I am an addict and a substance abuser especially when it comes to marijuana and nicotine. I have quit multiple times while still working in this industry but every time I struggle hard especially because of this industry and not being able to get away from it all. I always get roped back into smoking and every time I get that first hit I’m hooked instantaneously. Whether it be me smoking after 3 months of quitting or 6 months or 2 weeks I always get roped back in and I always think to myself like ‘wow I messed up and I’m going to have to quit again and go through this stupid struggle of addiction all over from the start.’ This first night is always the worst worst worst night and I can never bare it anymore because I’ve gone through it so many times now. 


I honestly don’t know where I was headed with this post. I’m hoping someone in a similar situation can share their thoughts and struggles as well.

I find myself only going to work and school, and once I'm home, all I do is get high as shit and eat, play videogames, watch porn, and sleep.
I'm 24 and no longer a teenager or early 20's kid that can live like this and it's ""perfectly fine"". What about the book I am writing? The certificates I want to get? The business I want to develop? The books I want to read? The physique I once had? 

I understand now what must be done and the mindset I must have. I understand that some things must be sacrificed. Yes, I will miss playing videogames high as balls and the immersion THC provides. I will miss getting high with my little brother and with friends. But that is not much to miss when compared to all the benefits that sobriety will bring. There is no place for THC in my life.

It's certainly helped me a lot, but I can't seem to put the words into action consistently, and always find myself back at square one. 

I've been smoking since I was 16 or 17. I'm 24 now, and I fear for my future family's well-being, as well as my sanity. The longest I've gone without weed in a year was 9 1/2 days, and the longest I've gone in these eight years was a mere two months. However, for the past couple of months, I've been able to smoke just for a few days, then quit for one or two; I binge and then I repeat.

I realized some time ago that, when I attempt to quit, I lie to myself. It's as though there aren't even any cravings any more, it's all just lies that make me smoke again. The truth that, ""I must not smoke any more"" always ends up blanketed in by these justifications that cause me to smoke again. 

The justifications are usually, ""Eh, if I haven't smoked these past few days, I'm sure I'm strong enough to only smoke in moderation"" or, ""I think it would be better to quit nicotine first, since I can't handle quitting both at once"". What gets me the most is the couple days after quitting. As I'm sure most of you know, the first few days after quitting is pretty awful. I end up ""needing"" to level out, when in reality, if I only give it a few more days, things get a lot easier. The night sweats suck, the intense dreams suck, etc. But when I wake up in the morning.. I'm not depressed like usual, I don't have nearly as much anxiety as usual, I can think better and, overall, I just feel stronger... but I just can't seem to keep it up. I always end up lying to myself and caving. This cycle has had a crippling effect (affect?) on my life. I don't have a job, I don't chat and date with girls like I do when I'm sober (and when I do end up dating someone, my addiction destroys the relationship). My mental health just goes haywire in more ways than I can explain. 

What I need is stability, and I've achieved that time and time again; I've stared it dead in the face. I quit, notice how much better I'm doing, and yet I still end up searching through my mind for any justification to smoke. The fact of the matter is, I can't smoke ever again if I want to stay sane, strong and happy. I can't keep wasting away my life, digging a deeper hole, just so I can get high every day. It's not worth it is so, so many ways.

I think one of my problems is that I'm just so bored. My addiction has caused me to hang out in my apartment most of the day, and only leave to go smoke, eat, and finish very necessary tasks. I don't even like hanging out here, but I do when I get high. I don't even like playing Overwatch, but I do when I'm high. I like hanging out with friends, going out of my comfort zone, engaging in new and tougher scenarios.. when I'm sober. It's just that, when I do end up bored again, usually at the end of the day when everything is said and done, I feel a heavy trigger to smoke, and that trigger is boredom.. yet I can't ever see it in that moment. 

It's as though the devil is on one shoulder, and the angel on the other shoulder is bound and gagged, clouded by a veil of pot smoke. 

The reality is, I'm losing time fast. These past eight years are a blur. So many years lost, where I should have been molding what could have been me. It's made my mental health so much worse. I feel trapped in a vicious cycle. I hate who I've created, I'm flat-out scared.

I want to put my story down because maybe it will resonate with others, but mostly because I want others that have been in my position to see it and maybe give me some words of wisdom.

I began smoking about 6 months out of high school. One of my mates was my dealer so I had easy access to large quanities. On top of this, I had access to a lot of disposable income which I would blow on weed and CSGO cases. I quickly began smoking daily and in my first semester of uni, I dropped out. 

It is now 5 years later and while I have managed to have a few periods of sobriety, in general my days have been consumed by smoking weed and cigarettes while listening to my podcasts. The ciggies started because my friend said spinning my weed with tobacco would help it last longer. Soon after I began smoking straight ciggies as well. I have tried to restart my university, but every single time I have ended up dropping out due to my addiction. 

I have dropped down into a state where I can often barely motivate myself to brush my teeth or have a shower each day. I just want to smoke weed, ciggies and listen to my podcasts (at least in the moments when I am sober). The addition of tobacco to my routine has resulted in me (now, in my worst state) sitting outside for 20mins-1hr at a time, smoking a bowl, then one cigarette, then another bowl and a ciggie, and on and on. I never want to interact with others, and I have absolutely no willpower to force myself out of this hole. 

I know that I am hurting my family a lot (they have told me as such), but when I am out of weed nothing else enters my brain except ""lets get more"". I feel like I have no control of myself. On days where I am motivated to quit I am strong for most of the day, then will inevitably break down and message my dealer almost without thinking. When I am high, I tell myself that ""I'll quit tomorrow"" or ""Alright, one last night then I'll sort myself out"". Then when I wake up the next morning, all of that is gone, replaced with withdrawals that I'd normally never think about because the first thing I'd do when I woke up is smoke. I want to be free of my addiction but it is so hard. 

As I said at the start of the post, I am sitting here with no weed. This is the first day of the rest of my life. I've said that to myself many times over, but maybe today will actually be the day. I am having a few drinks to work past the withdrawals (although I know this is a bad idea because in the past I have ended up basically substituting alcohol for weed while trying to quit, ending up drinking pretty much 6 nights a week for 2 months). Obviously my problem is a substance abuse problem, rather than specifically a weed problem. 

This post is a jumbled mess, but I had a real desire to try and put at least some of my thoughts down. And what better place than this? Maybe someone has felt the same as me before and can offer some words of advice or encouragement. 

I really want to get over this, guys. If you asked me what I wanted to be when I was younger I said ""rich"" or ""doing something I actually loved"". But that shit went straight out the window when I started smoking weed. I want to get back to a place where I feel like I have control over myself. 

I know this post is a fucking mess but please, if you resonate with any of it, or if you've been in a similar situation and pushed through to get out, PLEASE talk to me. I want to get out of my fucked headspace and actually get out into the real world and start my life.

I have left out a shitload of details and context but it is somewhat exhausting thinking about how fucked you are as a human (at least currently) and then putting it down into words. If you want to ask me anything about why or how or whatever, to get into my headspace about my situation PLEASE do. I am more than happy to elaborate.

However, as many have described here, I’ve been using more & more.  

I’ve been in counseling for the last year or so and recently started anti-depressants, which have helped.  After years of being a stay at home mom, I went back to work full time and that brought on a lot of stress etc ... The holidays are never an easy time and that overwhelmed feeling of drowning in it all has been taking over.

My ‘problem’ is I’m a very high-functioning addict ... I get motivated to do stuff when I smoke, I don’t withdraw from friends and family,  I perform well at work, Ive lost weight because I have cut back on drinking by probably 80% over the last year or so 

But - I have no self control and when I don’t need it for a medical reason, I want it even more for the ‘fun’.   Not enjoying ordinary life as I should ... I just substituted a wine habit w a weed habit ... 

I’m having an anxiety episode right now and can’t sleep because my daughter keeps smelling it on me ... while we’ve all been off, instead of just a hit before bed or after work like a typical weekday, I’ve been at it all day.

I’ve been smoking steadily since 17, I am now 21 with not much to show for those years besides hopping from job to job, being demotivated, distancing myself from good relationships and family as well as good opportunities that came my way. I wouldn’t stick with a choice if I knew there was a tough road ahead, I’d always choose the easy route because I could do it while stoned. Ring a bell? I’ve always had a tough time with social anxiety and I feel like weed would increase the anxieties I felt. I felt as if I knew what people were all about before they explained themselves so I’d never bother to get into a deep conversation. Also didn’t get into deep conversation for fear of forgetting what the conversation was about. Been vaping dabs from a wax atomizer for some time now and hoping to quit for 1 year to see where sobriety will take me. It felt as if my emotions were dulled until they piled up and over my head but I didn’t care cause I could get stoned and forget for a couple hours. Truth be told I miss it like an old friend. I want nothing more than to feel the warmth of the stone setting in but I must stay strong. For the bettering of myself, my family, and everything. I made a mistake smoking for this long and I need your support to stick with it. Shout out to all of you beautiful souls who have quit and are trying to quit.

I was 16 days clean and all was well. I was so excited to have this time away because currently school takes a lot of my time and is very stressful. I saw the break as an opportunity to be able to recover and sober up without this additional stress.

I hosted a party the first night of break and what do you know, I smoked. I had a really good time and I didn't really regret it at first. I thought, ""why can't I just moderate, like smoke at parties or occasionally with friends?"" But the next day there I was, alone in my room, with my bong.

I did that on repeat for the entire break up until tonight. I haven't hung out with anyone, done any homework, I was less connected to my family and Christmas, and I've been eating and sleeping like shit.

Now, I have to go back to school and work with full force in a few days (midterms coming up).

Just sit with the bad stuff for now and let it flow. It will pass.

Today marks two weeks sober for me. I had a really rough ride in the beginning. The withdrawals in the first week were brutal.. insomnia, horrific nightmares, mood swings, loss of appetite, migraines. It sucked. I’ve taken breaks before and I think the longest I made it was a month and a half, and then decided I would just smoke occasionally but would always end up back in the same old habit of smoking constantly. If I possess weed, I will smoke it every chance I get. This time I told myself that I am going to quit for good. I think that’s why it’s been so difficult this time around. 

Anyways, I think I’m past the withdrawal stage for the most part. I’m getting used to feeling things again and my emotions have really begun to regulate. Before I would smoke at any sign of any kind of negative sensation (sadness, physical pain, stress, etc.) but I’ve realized that I’m not actually dealing with anything when I’m high, just pushing it aside temporarily. Eventually it will all come crashing down again and I will need to just smoke more and more to cover it all up. Definitely not a sustainable or healthy way to live.

I didn't even know you guys existed and after reading some of the comments on here I wanted to say thank you. 

I started smoking when I was 14 and now I'm 24. I was just a rebellious kid looking to have fun and escape, 10 years later I'd consider myself nothing short of an addict. Through high school and college I spent months high from the time I woke up until I fell asleep. At my worst in college I was smoking an ounce a week alone. When I graduated it got better and worse. I was able to gradually only smoke after work. But, until a few days ago, I hadn't been sober for 24 hours in over two years. I keep trying but then I think maybe a few puffs won't hurt and I'm back down the rabbit hole again. 

**But it's just weed right?** It's something that just gives you munchies and makes you laugh, it just helps take the edge off after a shitty day at work, it helps you make friends and highten the things you already enjoy in life, right? 

Wrong, there's a dark side to it too, eventually I became emotionless and disconnected. I got to the point I'd sell blood to pay off my debt or the part I regret the most, stealing nugs from my best friend. Eventually I'd rather be at home by myself alone smoking and playing video games over spending time with friends and. Eventually I felt like I had no control, instead of enjoying smoking I felt like I couldn't stop and when I did, I couldn't cope with life. 

Now, its gotten to the point everytime I smoke I have panic attacks and spend the entire high thinking about how I just want to stop. I've always had anxiety and depression but the one thing that I used to manage it has now become my biggest demon. I feel like I lose a grip on reality and get those really dark thoughts that nobody wants to talk about. 

I've quit so many times, I've thrown everything away, changed my habits, talked to my family but somehow always end up high again, and the second I put down the J or bowl, the freakout starts again.

The truth is, I'm scared, what if I permanently damaged my brain from smoking so young and spending so many weeks and months high? What if I'm on the verge of a psycotic break because of the damage I've done? What if this is just how I am now and there's nothing I can do about it.

Of course, there have been emotions that I've had to deal with (expected after being high for 4 years) but I wouldn't trade it for anything, not even to get high.

Practical things: find stuff to occupy you. I've picked art and poetry back up, even starting playing piano again. You're going to rediscover your depth when you get sober, so whether it's exercise or art or reading or cooking, etc, make sure you have something (healthy!) to funnel emotions into.

Three years later and it turns out, I was really wrong.

My boyfriend smokes weed daily and enjoys it. He’s not ready to quit and had this habit long before we got together, but I’ve realised it’s effecting my life/mental health badly. I crave it constantly as it’s now become a daily habit, even though I’ve wanted to quit for a while.

After I’ve had one joint, I want another straight away. My boyfriend has even noticed my breathing is awful/heavy when I smoke and my heart rate is insanely high (just like me...lol).

I’ve been sober since Christmas Eve as I’m at my family’s and have had night sweats, anxiety, cravings etc. I’m okay with this. My problem is when I return - how can I quit when it’s right in front of me? When my boyfriend has lit up? I just can’t resist it when it’s there. He smokes daily, as I said, and we live together, which makes it harder.

I don’t really have anyone to turn to in regards to this, so any help would be really, really appreciated. 

TLDR: I want to give up smoking weed but my live-in boyfriend doesn’t. I can’t have someone smoke in front of me without giving in. Any advice would help.",19,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.986045777797699}"

I have been lurking on this subreddit for a few days now and have been very inspired by all of you! Here's a bit about me: I'm a young professional who just graduated college a little over a year ago. Weed has been a part of my life since I was 18 (I am 24 now). I started smoking my final semester of high school, but it was not heavy.  I started smoking most nights as a way to relieve stress. For the next 2.5 years after that, I went on and off of daily smoking, probably averaging toking up about 3-4 days a week. My then boyfriend and I smoked together on the weekends. I would smoke up maybe once or twice a week without him, living with my parents as I finished up my undergraduate degree.

After my ex and I broke up, my mental health was not good and I looked for a rebound. I started dating an abusive narcissistic alcoholic my Senior year of college who heavily encouraged me to do drugs and alcohol. About a few months into dating him, I suffered an awful manic episode due to lack of sleep, and was hospitalized. I was smoking about 2 grams a day at this point. The next year, I smoked more and more, building up to around 5-6 grams a day by December 2018. My dad has always smoked and kept a big supply, so it was very accessible. He, however, only takes a few hits at night and then goes to sleep. I knew I had to cut back, so I did, but I was still smoking daily. Getting a job really helped with cutting back. By the time Fall 2019 rolled around, I was down to 1-1.5 grams daily, a major improvement. 

Still, I knew that smoking was bad for my paranoia, anxiety, and overall health. I was informed of a seasonal job opportunity in a city 800 miles away the day before Thanksgiving, and I took it. I moved here on the 19th of December, and took my last puff on the 20th with my dad before he went back home. He gave me half an ounce before he left, but I haven't touched it, and don't plan on it. My family and friends have been very supportive of my decision. Moving into a smoke free apartment has really helped as I can't just toke up whenever. I've also found the change of scene has been good for quitting, it is kind of like a fresh start.  I have had a few cravings and life isn't perfect now that I've quit, but my paranoia and anxiety have significantly improved. I can already tell I am breathing better, too. I am glad to know this subreddit is here for the support, and encourage anyone who is thinking about quitting to take the plunge, I'm glad I did.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9719660878181458}"

I'm aware that this time is not nearly as long as some of you (I've been lurking just a bit), but addiction is addiction and quitting is still fucking hard.

I was talking earlier with my sister who also smokes (but responsibly, somehow) and she asked me why I smoke. For me the answer is that it makes me feel relaxed and / or it makes doing something so much more fun and enjoyable (mostly). However, the question made me think again about how stoners are different in their reactions to weed. For example, I have __always__ been the type that can be pretty productive / highly functional - I enjoy doing things when I smoke. I (usually) do my schoolwork high, I like to read high, I like to boulder high, I like to be high when I get high... I just like to fucking be high and I've convinced myself through weed that being high for just about anything you could do is better than being sober while doing that same thing. This sounds fucking ridiculous, yet if you’re like me then it’s still convincing.

That's the difference between my sister and I though; she is the stoner that smokes and just relaxes on the couch and doesn't go out ever. Once she smokes, it's chill time then bed time. I can do this too, but it's not how I can most enjoy my high time. But obviously the problem is that it's simply unsustainable to smoke every time you do some type of activity, but I really truly struggle with controlling it to a level where I can smoke like my sister (she's still had half an ounce since late October or so, which is crazy to me). I was curious to see if other smokers here have any insight in to how to quit if you're the type of smoker who likes to smoke for everything they do.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8811613917350769}"

When I first suffered a panic attack a month ago, I dealt with frequent anxiety and insomnia for a couple of days, and then it was acid reflux, then derealization and brain fog, and then on-and-off depression until I finally felt normal, all of this over the course of about a week and a half.

I recognized my brain still wasn't perfect, but it definitely didn't feel as tortured as before. This continued for about 3 weeks, and then on Monday (day 73 for me) I suffered from another bout of anxiety, which pretty much led me to follow the same rhythm to each symptom, albeit they were all significantly easier to manage. 

Realizing all this has made it easier not only for me to manage, but for me to understand the symptoms are temporary, and that I can and will feel better. Admittedly it was a little disappointing at first, I thought I was finally free from withdrawals. Nobody gets off that easy though, and now more than ever I understand I have to give my all to fight this off.

I’m in a constant brain fog, heart pounding and sweating, alternating wildly between deep depression and anxiety. It’s getting a little better day by day but still crappy. 

That is, until I think back on what being high all the time is like. It’s like consciously choosing to always have a cold.

But I know myself better than y'all.
I'm an ACE. I'm a fucking ACE. I'M FUCKING PRINCIPLED TO MY HAIR FOLLICLES.
I could be a blessing to the whole world if not for weed.
All the shit I've survived, all the times I've cheated death and smiled in it's face?
I've bought weed in the past five days, but I've failed to smoke it. Every time I've bought it, I've ended up either flashing it in the toilet or giving it to a friend.
Most of my friends if not all smoke, they've asked me time and again to just take a puff.
My answer has always been and will always be NO, NO, NO.

Super new to this so not sure how long (or how long is too long) for such a post, but I'll try to keep it short and sweet.

I quit the lovely greens two months ago (and since then took a hit twice earlier on in the first month, weak I know, but since then been good about it). Prior to that, I was probably going through a quarter per week via bong hits for about 4 years.

I started coughing up (sorry if this is graphic) black mucus/phlegm on a daily basis (started 24 hours after my last hit). Since then, it has been getting less and less but nonetheless still coming up on a daily basis (either black or grey colored specks). From what I have read, this is normal (some people say 1 month, others say 3-4 months, even read up to a year), but it has been almost two months and still coming up. My question is, how long did it take your black specks/mucus to stop coming up? Also, is there anything to do (other than warm showers/tea/going cold turkey) to help this process? And yes, I am planning to head to the doctors on month 3 if this still continues but just wanted to see if I could gather more opinions/past experiences.

2019-12-26 14:21:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/efzmhs/first_time_posting_last_time_quitting/,"First time posting, last time quitting","I've been browsing this subreddit for a little while, knowing that I would be needing to stop soon, but I think I am finally ready today. This isn't my first time trying to quit smoking, but I am hoping it will be the last. I could use any advice anyone could offer, and I need to get some stuff off my chest before I can do this. I don't have anyone in my life that knows I smoke and isn't also a total pothead, so I don't have anyone right now who will understand me about this. I hope this isn't too long, but I'd like to share my thoughts

I didn't smoke pot until I was in college. My brother has a mental illness where he falls into psychosis and for a very long time I blamed pot for that. I also have mental health issues similar to his but not as severe, and I was horrified of what I thought it would do to me. All my friends were stoners though, and after he had multiple relapses without any drug use I began to accept his illness and became more open to the idea of smoking. Since I started smoking approx. 2 years ago I have gradually smoked more and more. Prior to a week ago, I had been smoking dispensary dabs at least 4 times a day, smoking bud once or twice in large quantities, and on certain nights way more. It was at the point where my tolerance was so high I could smoke two bowls straight and not feel it. 

Here are my worries. My mental health issues have also been acting up, including an eating disorder that I would smoke weed to cope with. I wasn't on my right meds. Honestly, I am addicted to weed as a coping mechanism, and for the first time a couple of months ago, I had an anxiety attack that smoking couldn't take away. It wasn't particularly bad but I just have been living my life high, so it didn't make a difference. Another huge issue is the amount of money I have been spending on it. Don't even ask. My problem is if my non-stoner friends and family knew how much I was smoking they'd put me in hospital. My stoner friends are always just like ""nah just cut back a little your tolerance is just too high"". My boyfriend is a huge stoner. I am ready for today to be my last smoke but when he gets back from his families for christmas I think one of my gifts is probably weed of some sort. I also just don't know if I can do it without allowing myself to ""relapse"" once in a while but I've seen everyone here say thats a surefire way to fall back in. I use smoking to deal with my eating disorder and thoughts of self harm. I have had a very bad history with it and haven't relapsed since smoking pot. If it came down to it, I would smoke over cutting myself. I need something else to fill the void. I've been very depressed recently and alone for these holidays, which is heartbreaking for me. I have also been pushing people away because I choose to hang out with whoever has weed and not who I havent in a while or whatever. Almost all my relationships that aren't between me and my 2 best friends or me and my bf are strained.

Here's what I want to try to use to motivate me instead, and things that have made me think I am ready. The last month I have been back on my meds. Winter is always hard for me and without meaning to I had been skipping them way too often. I'm starting to have moments I feel mentally healthy and well without smoking again.  I have always loved art, I've been getting into painting and drawing a lot, and I've always been musically inclined. I used to write my own music on my ukelele and post it to youtube, but I kind of lost motivation for it when I lost motivation in myself. I still play all the time. For christmas this year my roommate gave me a microphone, I had always complained I didnt have one, and told me that I had a gift and my music needed to be shared and it was genuinely the most menaningful thing anyones ever gotten for me. I smoked a bowl on my way here, pretty much the last of my weed right now and was just like, ""I'm gonna do it, Im gonna go home and post on leaves and tell everyone and quit"". I have one more keif bowl I'm going to smoke, I'm going to sit down and try to write a song about all of these emotions, and what weed has done to me, and I want that to be it. I don't know if I'm crazy, or if I can do it. This could be my year.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995607316493988}"

I’ve been watching this thread consistently for a few months and felt compelled to share. Today is Day 1 of sobriety, again, and hopefully the last. Like so many of you, I have been forced to face the fact that what I thought helped me so much is actually my biggest struggle. 

I’ve been a smoker for about 10+ years. When I started, life was a wreck. My mom and stepdad split (and after my father leaving when I was a kid, that was just a gut punch). I let my pain hide in anger because that made me feel stronger; less vulnerable. Once I found MJ, I thought I had it all figured out: this is what will keep me leveled and happy. This stuff right here, thats what I’ve been missing all along. 

Fast forward to today, and I am watching my beautiful 2 yr old daughter play with her new toys. I’m married, have a kid, steady job blossoming into a great career. I have only a few friends, but good friends with great substance in many areas. Though my own family barely associates with me, my in-laws have showered me with affection to make sure I know I am not alone in this world. There was once a time MJ helped. It used to help me stay calm, avoid the depression of loneliness, and maintain positivity. But now, every time I spark a bowl a part of me hates me. And that part is growing. I’ve lived a life I hate; one where I am sickened by the man in the mirror, and I dont have any wish to go back to that place. 

Today is it. I’m a little terrified, but thanks to you all and this thread I am more motivated than I ever have been. I believe the universe gives signs if you pay attention. Finding you all is my sign that the time has come to let go and move on. Thank you all for your words of encouragement, for though they may not have been aimed at me they hit home hard and have given me the fire inside I have been looking for so long. 

Lastly, to anyone who can relate, anyone who has doubt or concern: you are doing the right thing. Your family and friends will appreciate it. But most importantly, when you look in the mirror and see that person smiling back at you with pride, you will be happier. Bless you all, stay strong, and let me know of I can help you with your struggles. Not that I am an expert by any means, but sometimes commiseration makes all the difference.

Since freshman year I’ve been smoking every day at least 4-5 times. When I came home for Christmas break this year on Dec. 23, I only brought 10 edibles with me, no flower, thinking that I would take one each day until I went back to school on NYE. 

I had a job interview for a bank the day I got back on Dec. 23rd, and I killed the interview and was actually offered a job that same day. They informed me I would be getting drug tested in early January. I’m hoping that 3-4 weeks will be enough to get it out of my system (I’m 6-2, 180lbs with a fast metabolism). But since that day, I have been staying offfff the Weeeeeed. 

In these 3 days I have probably had the worst sleep I’ve ever had in the past 4 years. Constantly waking up, sweating, having weird dreams that feel loosely lucid but not quite. My appetite has been all Over the place. I have been remembering little details of my day that I always forget when smoking. When I wake up, even though my sleep was terrible, I still feel less groggy than I did when I was smoking. 

I don’t know what my plan is when I get back to school. I will need to be very mentally strong and continue to remind myself that this job is worth much more than a few rips from a bong or a J. We all know how difficult it is cohabiting a house or apt with stoner friends, but hopefully mine will understand the situation and not pressure me.

I realise as I write this how maniacal that sounds but honestly believe that I am a sane person.

I think really I was sad because I didn't  celebrate Christmas. I'm just at a place in my life were I don't know how or who to socialize with. My son is getting older. He is out of state and I won't be seeing him for Christmas or New Years this year. I have no family in this town. I know a few people, but they are party people. It is a little rough on me because I am alone another year on Christmas.

 I am wishing for the ability to change my way of living so I might have better Christmas next year. I look around and think: I may as well smoke because I should have some enjoyment and some company on the holiday. I can call an old friend. 

I'm not going to make the call. I'm a 45 year old man. I quit drinking a long time ago. I've quit drinking, I've quit tobacco, I've quit weed, I've quit everything because addiction was making me nuts, and all my moderation switches are busted. I sometimes wonder if I am just nuts anyhow. I'll just have to figure out how to interact socially without getting loaded. I'll have to interact with my unaltered self also. Am I being too tough on myself? 

I might like to figure out how to keep a girlfriend. Sobriety could help in the relationship department someday. What the hell, I may even want to have another family someday if it's not too late.

But I'm an artist, a risk taker, an unstable loose cannon in search of truth and freedom. What woman is going to put up with that?  It's true, but I can love! God knows I can love! Since this is true that means I can change. I can have the confidence to know I am making the right choices.

We are in this together ! 🙏","Hello guys, this is not my main language so I'm sorry if it's not perfectly written my story. 

I will let just a little introduction about my self and if you wanna pass that just go where is this arrow --->

So from the beginning i start smoking with 14 and since 18y im being a heavy smoker until 17 November with 22y. I had a break of 1 years after smoked weed and watching some things on medic Google and had panic attack with 19y where I discover I had anxiety, but since there I can cooperate with it and control and never happened again.
At 20 my my girlfriend broke up with me, and since there I was so depressed I start to smoke like crazy, I think for hiding the feelings. I smoke cigarettes aswell, but I always thought that joints aren't bad at all so I smoked them as cigarettes (almost always hash and sometimes weed) like 10 or more per day. My father smoke too so if my stash just finish I could just ask him some and he would give me.

----> So, now it starts really the interesting part after a little introduction about my self. 
Since 2 years of heavy smoke almost I couldn't get high even my friends was always shocked how was possible cause I could just finish one joint and roll another without any problem!
And since 2 month ago I start having a strange feeling like I couldn't thought properly.. 
Everything in my life was perfect, I was going to lists of school to sing rap (my biggest passion) had met a really nice girl at this time too and we start a relation never felt so happy! 
I had really high libido and a lot of feelings, but since I quited weed and tobacco everything start to change..

Started day 17 November 

The first week everything was normal except the extreme sweating, shakiness from hot to cold sensations and extreme anxiety where I felt always my heart racing, my emotions where fucking extreme!

The second week everything started to be awful I get derealization where it seemed that I was a ghost, my emotions disappeared, my vision it was kind like it was in the back of my head, 0 libido couldn't even had a erection, everything I used to enjoy (games, sing, go out, being with friends, sk8) I could find any pleasure or even focus or concentrate on them.. nothing seemed real and it was like I didn't know my self, kinda like I was a watcher of my own life.. I just wanted to be in my room and cry, thinking that I would never be myself again and that I fucked my life..

The next weeks I started to smoke cigarettes again, my thoughts comed back.. I started to feel so dead inside and so robotic like, that I relapsed on day 1, 3 and 9 of December and I had smoked a joints with the thoughts that maybe If I did I come back to my self.. but it didn't, and it just made the things a lot worse!!!!

1 week later after day 16 I started to feel more grounded, I started to have a lot of lucid dream and extreme sweating during the nights!

Now im in my day 16 sober and I feel a lot better from it, it's like it comes and goes in waves, but I'm having a lot of insomnia that now are getting a lot better, my lucid dreams are fadding away hopeffuly cause they were always like a fucking war! I can enjoy my old hobbys not like really feeling a lot for them but I can focus on them, but my libido its 0 it's like my dick it's dead, and I feel like a fucking robot without any emotions! I feel feelings though, I know the person's that I love! And now I kind feel dizzy through the days.. but everyday I feel a little better that's my hope!

My girlfriend it's the most beautifull girl I saw in my life both physically and mentally and I spoke about everything thats happening to me and she is a angel and understand everything I feel so lucky for that, I don't know what was me without her, it's like she is for me the light at the end of the tunnel! But I feel so useless..  I want to be me again 100% for me and for her.. just hope this will pass and that's not permanent.. hope you guys can help me and that my story can help others!
Stay strong guys!

Edit: I do every 2 days weightlifting exercises and longboard, only drinking water and eating a lot of carbs and proteins.

A few weeks ago I posted about the power of making a firm decision and how much it has transformed my life.  I got a lot of personal messages thanking me and many people seemed to like this angle so I'm sharing again.

It seems that with the holidays, there have been so many posts about whether this might not be a good time to try smoking again, about social environments that put you in the partying mood, about ""it'll be OK just this one time,"" about trying to get some validation for resuming the habit.  But above all I'm seeing so many posts about people feeling distraught at having relapsed, filled with regret and shame and calling themselves weak, hopeless, worthless and so on.    


Yes, we have a lot of steps to take to alter the mental and emotional environment that makes us want to be high all day, and a lot of work to do to water the garden of our creativity, our critical thought, our joy, our energy. But believing that we're useless and can ""never do it"" is a circular logic that keeps us smoking to compensate for our bad self-worth.  I hope this post can help you feel strong, decisive and clear about your path ahead. All the best!  


**Reposted:**  
Recently, I read the book *This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol* by Annie Grace. I highly recommend it, even though I don't drink, and when I did, never had problems or addictive tendencies with alcohol. I read the book at the request of a friend who is an alcoholic who wanted me to be an accountability and support person. He wanted me to understand more of what he was going through by reading the book. I could relate through my experience with marijuana, even though popular wisdom says alcohol is addictive and marijuana isn't.

Anyway, in this book the author said something that really struck me deeply. She said that when you make a decision to be sober for life, you make ONE DECISION. ONE DECISION!!! One strong, clear, solid, powerful but simple decision changes the course of your future reality forever, and then you don't have to re-consider it *ever again.*

On the other hand, when you tell yourself that you may one day be able to use again, or that you will use only sometimes, or that you will use ""lightly"" or ""moderately"", or that when such-and-such circumstances change you can go back to using, a million other decisions line up and clutter the rest of your life.

When you leave the choice of using again open for the future, you have to engage with that choice on a constant basis. Every day, you have the anxiety of wondering whether this is the day you ""get"" to start again. Or whether this emotion, or this social crowd, or this situation justifies starting up again. Or whether a certain date at a certain time in future is when you give yourself permission to drink / smoke / use again.

**The author says that the amount of emotional, psychic and mental energy that is consumed by having to re-make this choice again and again, forever, is devastating for your nervous system.** It leaves so much uncertainty, strengthens your anxiety and drains you of confidence. You're never free - each day you need to confront *Will I or Won't I?* It's exhausting and unclear.

It made so much sense to me and explained so much about why I was miserable for many years trying to stop smoking marijuana. It also explains why I felt immediately liberated, energized and truly relieved when I finally stopped (almost 2,300 days ago) even though the yearning for the habit took some time to fade.

When I was off weed for 100 days, my life was so so good... Extremely productive. Almost a bit too much... I went from extreme laziness to extreme productivity creating a huge burn out which led to my relapse.

First of all you really have to find a set sleep schedule so that you go to bed at the same time every day and wake up at the same time. This solved my insomnia in 3 days. 
Second of all I would highly advice as much exercise as possible, if the time is there daily is the best. It is a way to release tensions and also keep your mind of things. The dopamine high is the best thing about it tho.
The third thing I use is reading, but writing is also an option. I always smoked in the evening but nowadays I can’t. The first days I got really bored but then I started reading. It can completely catch my thoughts for hours so that i don’t get bored.

2019-12-24 23:31:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/efbzmk/leaving_so_soon/,Leaving So Soon,"I've begun to notice over the last several months that the number one sensation I feel as a result of consuming weed is......acute anxiety! I think I've known that my relationship with this drug has been fucked up for a while, but it has really reared its head as I have been feeling myself compulsively heating up the nail again even though I \*know\* I am immediately going to feel like shit afterward. I think each of the last 10 or so dabs I've done have had the same internal monologue telling me I am an idiot and will immediately regret it. I do 'em anyway.

Since August, I've been living entirely by myself (plus my cat -- I'm a 26 year old dude in Michigan, USA) and that has really given way to some destructive habits surrounding smoking alone. I'm finding it extremely isolating, and it's cutting into my motivation for everything else except for playing video games. I could care so much more about my job, my health, my social life, my finances, etc.

Mostly I am interested in knowing what coping mechanisms people use. Last time I quit for a long time, I took up nicotine vaping, and I am absolutely not doing that. The main reason is that I knew my last stoppage was going to be temporary, but this one is going to be indefinite, and I'm not trying to replace it with another bad habit.

Do you fill the hole with exercise (I also did this last time -- never been in better shape in my life and I cannot wait to get back there)?

How do you reacclimate to socializing without it? This was incredibly tough for me the last time I quit, but I also was not allowed to consume alcohol so bars and parties in general just became a chore.

I had another question but it got Thought Police'd right the fuck outta here.
&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is a side note, but I think the most interesting realization I've had while considering quitting is regarding my attitudes towards marijuana vs. alcohol. My best stoner friend and I have spent a lot of time shitting on alcohol as a drug, pointing to our alcoholic friends as bad examples and lamenting at the fact that it remains a legal substance while pot, at least federally, does not. ""Look at what alcoholism does to peoples' lives, you don't see marijuana doing that."" And for the record, I \*don't\* believe that the most severe cases of weed addiction compare to the most severe cases of alcoholism, alcohol will destroy your body in ways that THC literally cannot.

But the important realization is that while all of these things may be true, \*I\* am not an alcoholic. I can control my behavior around alcohol. I cannot control it around marijuana. I can make all the excuses in the world for why it is objectively a less dangerous substance than alcohol, but \*I\* have never driven drunk despite formerly having a habit for \*literally going to take a drive specifically to smoke a joint on the road\*. I've never had a drink in the middle of a workday, but I bring a THC vape to work to use in the bathroom. 

I think I spent a lot of time trying to find a way to prove some point to myself about substances themselves, when the raw truth of the matter is that weed doesn't fucking work for me and in all likelihood cannot hold a long-term place in my life. A destructive cycle is a destructive cycle, doesn't matter if your drug of choice is weed, alcohol, or binge-watching reruns of 90s shows. 

Mostly, I am tired of underwhelming myself. I am excited to see what kind of moves I can make in my life when I get rid of this crutch. When I get rid of my excuse for underperformance.

So this is my gazillionth time quitting. I’ve been smoking daily for around 6 years.

It’s my 5th year at university, and my usage have gone through pretty identifiable cycles related to the semester. I justified my usage with the fact that I’m an A student, so if it doesn’t affect my grades, why bother quitting?

Turns out it’s bullshit. I become a dopamine junkie when toking. Munching chocolate like there’s no tomorrow, watching porn and jacking off even though it feels like a chore, mindlessly watching YouTube way past my set bedtime every night cause I loved the feeling of hitting the bed when I could barely keep my eyelids open. I was also avoiding my friends and girlfriend so I could smoke alone.

Each morning I looked forward to my morning coffee, but then the whole day I would be impatiently waiting till the evening so I could toke. I’m tired of feeling like a slave to a plant.

This time, the day before my last exam, I threw out all my remaining stash. I did this because usually I will start smoking in the early afternoon in vacations and getting more and more depressed. After the exam, I felt freedom. Freedom not only from finishing the semester, but from not having to run home to my stash like it’s the only thing that matters. Shit, I would even hate on my friends for rolling joints slowly if I hadn’t got my first hit of the evening.

Conversations and time spent with friends, girlfriend and my parents feel much more genuine and rewarding the past two weeks. I feel much more confident and energetic.

I still feel like I have a ton of brain fog and a lot to work on, but I’ve now gained 5+ hours of time I can use productively each day because my brain is not shut down from 6pm, so now I can’t complain about there not being enough hours in a day.

Some things to note:

- I was going through something really traumatic when I quit smoking, so the withdrawals/not smoking were kind of the least of my problems at the time. However, when I had time to think about it I was proud of myself for getting through each tough day without smoking. 

- I decided to stop smoking the day I started house sitting for a super rich family (stayed there for about a month). And I did it cold turkey. I felt self conscious about smoking there and I had other things on my mind, so worrying about smoking near their expensive furniture or going for a long walk was too overwhelming to worry about. Plus I was in an environment where I hadn’t been high or smoked in before so I guess the change of scenery, habit and ritual was a blessing in disguise and probably helped me stop. 

- not having to worry about sneaking off and away from my family for a smoke during this holiday season is a relief too. I still don’t drink alcohol and I feel a bit sad that I’m not involved in that part of holiday celebrations but also happy to be and feel as healthy as I’ve ever been!

Social skill: My go to line is, ""Thanks, but not today"" when I'm offered cannabis. I live in a legalized state so it's not uncommon to be an event with edibles or vapes going around. It's different for everyone but it actually been a goal of mine to avoid sharing my big weed identity with everyone. When I first quit I was probably oversharing with folks, like, ""hey do you want to hit this?"" me: ""No thanks, I'm actually super addicted to weed. Even went to some Marijuana Anonymous meetings recently. I'm just one of those people that craves it too much so it's gotta be all or nothing for me."" Now I've realized that's not what someone actively smoking weed is looking for as a response so I just go with, ""Thanks but not today for me"" and that leaves it pretty open to interpretation but either way not today :)

It's been quite the journey.

Just going to do a little recap.

1.Thoughts about weed (how often do the urges come)

The first month was pretty tough, the first week being the worst. I still hang around smokers, but I refuse to engage in mary. 

It's not about other people smoking, it's really just myself I've found, I often get urges when I'm lonely and not in the midst of a project or work. 

I still think about smoking up when I am alone, I don't think that ever subsides. 

2. What can you do to replace weed?

Honestly, what you enjoy doing, is what you should now be doing.

 Marijuana for me was essentially a numbing agent emotionally and mentally, it allowed me to put off dealing with my life and moving forward with it. It allowed me to be comfortable with accomplishing the BAM (bare ass minimum).

For me, I write, I read, I play music (and actually go out and play now, rather than alone in my basement), I work out.

 I've started the process of getting back into school (education is super important if you want to continue thriving not just financially but mentally as well).

 I've also enlisted in the Naval reserves in my home country to learn some new skills (more so, for the experience as well). 

Also, I've started talking to women again, sober. 

I stopped drinking for 40 days, as alcohol caused me to smoke a joint last time, and that was a horrible experience. I really try to limit it, but I really do enjoy having some drinks with some people, so I can't deny myself that just yet. However, abstaining from alcohol provided some much-needed clarity, so I definitely recommend it initially. 

3. What's the best strategy to stop immediately?

Cold turkey and willpower. 

Honestly, you have to actually want to quit. If you don't want to, it will continuously creep back into your mind and eventually, you can cave. 

Get rid of your paraphernalia and stash if you feel you'll just jump back into it immediately. 

I farm in the summer, so I keep mine. I keep my paraphernalia as well because if anyone wants to toke at my place, they are welcome to.

In conclusion, I've noticed immense benefits, a clearer mind, a stronger body, improvement of overall happiness, deeper connection to my wants and needs. 

Merry Christmas fellow leavers, happy holidays as well. If you want to stop, do it when you are prepared and ready to take action, it isn't easy, and lying to yourself can cause mental tribulation.

I'm having trouble with anxiety and I wanted to see a therapist as soon as the holidays ends, getting real help and stop escaping all my problems numbing myself with weed. I also opened up with my mother (to whom I never admitted using) and also I had an honest conversation with two of my best friends (who are stoners). They all gave me a lot of supports, and I was so sure that this was it, I was definetely not gonna smoke anytime soon.

It's not only the fact that I'm not dealing with my anxiety (and maybe worsening it in the process), I have a lot of other reasons to quit, when I'm high I: eat really bad, am a lot less talkative, I lose motivation to do anything etc. 
Despite all this, yesterday I smoked. I was with some friends (the two who I talked with weren't there yet), I said no to the first 2-3 joints, but at some point one of them mindlessly passed me one. I could feel, as the night went by, that my motivation to stay sober was cracking, I was trying to focus on the reasons I didn't want to smoke, but couldn't find any. So I stared at the joint for like then seconds and finally took 3 small hits.

After 15 minutes my two other friends showed up, and I think they couldn't tell I smoked. They didn't say nothing about it and didn't pass me the following joints. Nevertheless, I felt a bit of shame, I felt like a hypocrite. We fucking talked for like 4 hours about our relationship with weed, other drugs and mental illness, and they said that they respect me, because I was honest with myself and was able to say no after recognizing that it was affecting my well being in the long term. And then I smoked. 
Now that I think about it, this was the only time that there was weed around me without them being there with me since I stopped. I thought that I was so committed to quit, but maybe I was only afraid of being judged by them?

The worse thing is that I can't be like ""yeah I relapsed and remembered why I didn't enjoy weed anymore"" like a lot of people do in this sub. I really enjoyed the rest of the night. I usually have an ""all or nothing mentality"", which means that once I take a hit I go full stoner-mode and could smoke until I pass out, but last night I only had three hits so I didn't have any of the bad effects I usually have: I was talkative, I laughed a lot, I was relaxed, generally just had an awesome time watching a couple episodes of Rick and Morty and then playing a board game with my best friends.

I fucking hate this. The only bad effect I had is that today I find myself obsessing over whether or not I should quit. I also woke up early because I had stuff to do and had a friend coming over to study this afternoon, it didn't actually affect me in anyway.
Why can't it always be this way? Why I know it will spiral down and I'll become again that zombie without any motivation, interests, passion, who just smoke away all his fears and smoke so much when is with other people to the point that I don't talk to anyone?

p.s.
I know a lot of you will suggest me to find other friends who don't smoke. I won't. I am away from home for uni most of the time, and even though I'm struggling making friends there who don't smoke (it seems like I just connect with people more easily through weed, which I find strange since I become a paranoid zombie as I said), it's a lot easier avoiding weed when I am there: I have to take classes, I have more stuff to do, a house to take care of, I am generally more busy. But when I am home, the vast majority of my old friends smoke everyday, and even It I try to spend time with non-smoker, weed is just going to be there, and I refuse to lose my best friends because of this. I love them and have fun with them even if I am sober, they're not the problem, I am.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9919041991233826}"

Writing this now I am 23, turning 24 next month. In order for this story to be told in its entirety I must go to the start, 

The year is 2005 and I am 10 years old. My sister had some friends over, she was 15, her friends were huge stoners and I was a huge nerdy Runescape player and Naruto fanatic. I’m not entirely sure of how it went down seeing as it’s been so many years, but I do remember the end result was me very stoned and 4 inches from my TV screen, eating a whole box of Cheez-its. 

The next time I ever smoked was the summer of 8th grade, I was with my friend Taylor and we smoked out of her corn cobb pipe, during this time I played football so I only did smoke that one day and then out of fear of being drug tested I stopped until the following year, the next summer before Sophomore year I quit football a few months after coming out, being the only gay player in a small town really weighed on me, people wanted me to interview for the paper, other teams yelled slurs during games because word spread so fast. I remember I played a team from the other side of the state and even they called me a f**. I began getting really depressed. I stopped talking to most of the friends I had grown up with, due to them not relating to me or liking me anymore or me feeling hurt and abandoned. I started to look for people and things that made me feel accepted and it wasn’t long before I called Taylor and asked if she would smoke me out, that led to me getting my own gear and supply and sneaking out all throughout the night to smoke. This continued all of high school, I made friends who smoked and did drugs, I was lucky to graduate. I had 260 absences in my senior year and I’m sure 99% were in relation to leaving to go taking gravity bong rips across the street. This continued and got even worse in 2013 when dabbing became very popularized. I remember being so high I would fall asleep in class or the floor would be moving, I never realized that I had any problems with substance abuse until I left high school and tried college. I went to a Private (40k a semester) University and it was one of the hardest things I ever did, I only lasted 1.5 years mostly due to me always being high and never studying, I was lucky to not fail my classes and leave before it costed me. Eventually though, I did realize at 19, that I needed change in my life. I wanted to find a deeper purpose than all the highness. I was developing severe disassociation due to all the dabbing, so I finally quit! I started to read, I meditated, I would run. I did things to feel alive. I had finally quit and was Scott free, I started dating someone I really liked and I felt things were moving along well.

We moved to another city together and things were great! Unfortunately this isn’t where my story ends, but rather where it really begins. I started a job that was over night, it was fine for the first couple months but my homophobic boss was really getting to me. As the insults piled up and the stress of waking up and getting ready became daunting, I started drinking, but I never was a drinker my whole life, so I figured hey lets pick up that old habit of yours, so I began smoking lightly. It was a very little amount at first, where as now I can easily smoke 2g’s in a day now. He continued to shame me and call me names for awhile until finally I had enough, I quit and left the place mid shift after he said to a coworker that “that f** is always in the bathroom” I was completely over it, I went home and began smoking. After that I struggled to find employment, I was sucked into tv and smoking every day, eventually I made a stupid decision to get a different apartment downtown, before even leaving my first place. I did this because I “couldn’t find a job” aka I needed a place I could smoke and work at. Eventually I did find employment but my depression and substance abuse got even worse. I found myself in another crappy job with a crappy boss. I felt isolated and depressed and finally bought a rig as I wanted to get that out of body high. Every day I woke up and took between 2-6 dabs before I went to work. I began wasting tons of money and time about $20 a day to be exact, my relationship started to fail and I saw sides of him I never saw, he also developed substance abuse with the dabs and lost his way. We moved from place to place, job to job and the only thing that has yet to change was the smoking.  

Fast forward to today, I’m taking the first day to go sober. And if you read this far I’m so thankful for you taking the time out of your day to read this. I recognize I have a habitual dependency on THC and I’m hoping by typing my truth out I can put it to rest. I’m hoping that seeing the whole picture can help me realize how I can move forward. I see now that I failed many times in my life due to not having any coping mechanisms or healthy techniques on dealing with stress. I’ve run from my problems for years now, I don’t want to take any of this into 2020. I’d love for the 20’s to be my decade of sobriety.

Felt like when I would just abuse weed, i'd do it to make up for the days where i stayed sober.

I wish i could just quit forever. Things staredt going really bad after my break-up.

Recently relapsed and also used casual sex as a coping mechanism,"I quit before, after a terrible breakdown of a relationship, I immediately used casual sex and weed to cope and got into a toxic relationship with a man who was an addict and introduced me to coke. 

I then spent 5 months sober. No dating and no weed. Focused on my career and got a great job doing marketing at a construction company. But as soon as got this job I began dating again. It wasnt long until I met a guy who smoked, he gave me some- I slept with him that night and immediately started sleeping around. One thing that was incredibly difficult was; I am a young attractive female, that was working in tech for construction- so I had constant attention (as there is not a lot of young females in the construction industry at all) and I became very promiscuous the more I started smoking. 

I have been sober for almost 2 months now. I have to focus on the positives. I own a house at the age of 23- I have made a good profit so far and only have a few thousand to pay back to my ex partner. I am in a position where I have a therapist and can afford to take some time off from working while I work on my emotional issues, I've developed from my very troubled childhood. 

I am on a dating ban for 2 years so I can learn to find happiness by myself, and work on qualities of being a mother- because that is ultimately what I want. Weed is actually the devils lettuce. My life changed so much when I turned to it to cope. 
I know I am attractive, I used to make an okay living modelling. So I know I will be okay finding a partner if my emotional issues are sorted by the time I am 25/26.
My alcoholic dad definitely doesn't help matters but I have finally released myself of responsibility of his sobriety, I can only focus on my own.

I smoked when I moved to a different country, I smoked through my undergrad and my master's degree. I smoked through the entirety of my longest relationship of 3 years.

I knew deep down that I have a problem for a long time now. I would quit every few months and last a week at most. It's so easy to rationalize weed use. I was able to accomplish a lot while smoking, but I would be lying if I said it didn't negatively impact my intimate relationships, friendships, ambitions.

I hate myself when I am high now, I become so awkward, scared of interaction, overthinking everything, feeling trapped in my house, skipping workouts. I really really want to stop, but apparently not badly enough - because I forget just how awful this addiction has treated me and start up again.

When I first started smoking weed helped me fit in in high school, make new friends (some real, some friends out of convenience) and be introspective. Some good things about being high remain, especially when I smoke after a break (read: failed sobriety), but overall it's just not worth it.

I can't believe I let this go on for so long. 7 years, I wonder where I would be if I didn't smoke - what I would have accomplished. Would I have the same anxiety issues if I didn't blaze all the time?

I am not exactly disappointed with my life and how everything is turning out, but I am almost 25 and I have not been sober longer than a month in this entire time. Even when I travelled the world and visited the most amazing places, I would seek out weed and get high - telling myself I had to experience everything high. I am so ashamed and tired of this, but I don't know if this is a vice I can beat.

Couldnt return the thing since it had been used, and I didnt want to buy another setup considering i just dropped $100 on one that was worth $25 at best.

I honestly felt great without it. I really didnt need it at all, wasn't even depressed. I just had gotten money and felt the temptation to use. I dont have friends and i dont leave the house besides work so I imagine loneliness was a big factor as a trigger.

I had in my mind that i was going to set aside $X for Christmas this year, and that everything will be fine. I was feeling great about myself getting a job and entering into responsible adulthood.

Once I ran out of money I thought, ""well, my final check is supposed to be mailed to me according to my boss"". That check has not come yet, and I'm still sitting here a broke dumbass.

I mean to be fair, I don't think people are really expecting me to give anybody gifts since I'm young and just got my first real paychecks recently. That's not an excuse by any means, but still.

I dont have the money to buy gifts now as im waiting for my next check to come in the mail, so if anyone has any ideas of gifts that i can possibly make(?) or anything i can do to remedy this situation please let me know. I dont have a credit card so i cant just pay it off later, unfortunately. and im not going to ask family or parents for money to buy people gifts since, well, that was completely my wrongdoing and responsibility to not fucking blow money on frivolous goods and weed.

Trying to quit for the 4th time but sleep issues keep me coming back.,"Two days ago I decided to give quitting another try. I've tried three other times before but I always run into the same issue. 30+ nights of 0 to 4 hours of sleep. It always follows the same pattern too. I will try every sleep quality trick in the book (no screens for two hours before bed, warm showers to relax, etc.), I'll take sleep medication as well, but I won't be able to sleep until somewhere between 2am and....never.


Last two nights have been even worse than before. In each instance I've only gotten 2 hours of sleep and it's only been after the sun has come up. I thought I might have delayed sleep phase disorder but I don't get 8 hours of sleep when I do eventually fall asleep. I get a few then I'm up.


What makes this all even stranger for me is that I have a ton of energy each day. Last time I went about 45 days with 4 hours of sleep max and I was able to function just fine. I did get to a point where I felt I was losing my grip on reality so I bought a joint and fell off the wagon.


I have crappy insurance and the only sleep doc in the area not only didn't listen to anything I had to say but prescribed me something I repeatedly said hasn't ever worked for me (Ambien). My primary care doc just keeps trying different anti-depressants, but none work and I feel that if Ambien and other sleep meds (both OTC and natural) don't work than it's probably not an issue medication can fix.


Can anyone share their experiences or provide any tips? While I can function, I don't spending 6+ hours a day laying in bed trying to sleep. I know that electronics can cause sleep issues as well so it isn't as if I'm spending those 6 hours playing games or watching anything. It's basically 6 hours of staring up at the ceiling.

I’ve been out of town for the last 4 days and was not tempted whatsoever, out of site, out of mind.

It was driving me mad last night, I had a fretful nights sleep not because of my withdrawals but because the temptation was there..... smoke me, just one hit, what’s the big deal, so easy.

I kept it hidden just in case, you know, I ever cave into my addictions and wanted.

Well, it’s with pride and a huge sense of accomplishment that I can say that I packed everything up, without consuming and handed it off. Let me tell you, the whole drive I was sweating and having to talk to myself not to cave in. It’s the addiction talking, it’s not worth it, you don’t want to reset the clock again. I imagined my heart racing and the guilt and the cravings starting all over again. No thanks.

okay so i’m a senior in high school nd have been smoking weed for like 3 yrs or so now but i used to just keep it to nights and rare occasions w certain friends bc i didn’t like the way it made my personality as much and i knew certain of my friends didn’t approve of my habit and didn’t wanna offend them or anything. but this year at some point near the end of the summer i started having all this unexpected work for a dual enrollment class and then school started and i just always had all this crazy amount of work to do that i couldn’t even comprehend so i never had time to hang w friends and smthg inside of me just kinda snapped so i was always so stressed that i just started smoking weed during the days to calm me down. at this point it is literally impossible for me to go through a day without smoking, and i don’t know the last day i haven’t sparked multiple times throughout. weed has caused me to fuck up at least one thing in every area of my life, but the only thing i wanna do the second i wake up is smoke weed. my addiction to weed as well as nicotine has caused some type of strain to every single relationship in my life and at this point i feel like i have no friends left. i know im being melodramatic bc like i have ppl i can find to hang out w if i’m bored and everything but i’ve just lost a few of my closest friends and that’s made me so depressed lately, which is making it harder to find the motivation to quit. i just don’t know how to overcome this or even if i care enough to, so i guess i’m just kinda asking for any advice with getting my shit together.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997596800327301}"

I now smoke when I wake up, before going to work, after work, sometimes in the middle of the day if I am home. I smoke before doing housework (toking and cleaning used to be so much fun), before cooking meals, before bed... You get the picture. I am what some would call a  functionning pot head.

I have realized that my relationship with cannabis is not healthy. It controls me and it has negatively impacted my life. So yesterday, I threw everything out. 1/4 oz, my pipe, papers, etc. 

My main motivator is my son. I don't want him to take it up. He's so smart and has so much potential. I want to protect that beautiful mind and I want to be an example to him. 

I am apprehensive about quitting over the Holidays, but I would like to start 2020 with a clear(-er) mind. Plus, there will always be a good reason not to quit now.

The cravings started when I texted my friend about staying off weed over the break, ironically, and built throughout the night as the party wore on. Once everyone had left, I considered driving out to buy some weed, but resisted the urge and figured that if I waited until the dispensaries closed I'd be weed free another night.

That's when I decided to check my stash, which I thought was weed free, but I am back home for the break so I wasn't certain. Lo and behold, I found probably about a single gram leftover, preground, with my one hitter and lighter right next to it. I put a blanket under my door, made a sploof, packed the one hitter, and then...

I don't know. I just sort of paused. Maybe I was worried about my parents smelling it, maybe I didn't wanna lose my streak, or maybe I was worried about losing most of tomorrow morning. Whatever the reason, I stopped myself, and I threw away the weed, the lighter, and the piece. It felt pretty good to be able to control the urge to use: I've never gotten that far along in the process and not smoked. 

So if there's anything good to take away from this story, it's that even if you get really close to smoking you can still stop the process, the motions don't have to be automatic, you still have control. Goodnight, and stay grounded y'all.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9820798635482788}"

Chronic use for 20 years on and off will do that to you I guess.  My last attempt was over a year ago.  Made it two months completely clean when on a family trip, my bro in law pulls out a joint and starts smoking it with my parents (legalization in Canada was still pretty new so this was VERY unexpected for me)  Also having my wife and parents not seeming to mind (none of them had any idea that I was even an addict much less coming off of months of slurping 0.5g of bho/rosin daily)  I decided since pot hadnt gotten me high in years it would be ok.  A full 2019 of even more BHO binging followed just from that one decision.  Here I am now.

I knew the only way I can be successful in this world of legal pot is to tell my wife and family about my struggle and let them know I will never want anything again with THC/CBD so please don't offer.

I feel solid now but I had the same false sense of security in previous quits (longest was over a year right after getting married).  

The trick is that for people like us, we've let the toothpaste out of the tube.  Our minds will do the mental gymnastics the rest of our lives telling us we've beat this or that it never really caused that much harm.  But just because I never lost my job, house, wife due to this drug, doesn't mean it didn't take away my ability to feel happy.  It always eventually does, and I'm sure many of you understand the feeling of being numb with pain/sadness just below the surface.

I was quite a heavy smoker for about 3 years. For the last year every joint that I did I was telling my self that this would be the last one, every night I finish all the weed that I’ve got because I was convincing myself that I’ll be quitting by tomorrow. Every time I stop smoking for a maximum of 3 days (95% I fall back to smoking by tomorrow) and then I fall back to smoke double what I was used to. It was very easy for my mind find the good arguments to make me go and get some. To be honest all I was thinking about last year is if I would be able to quit weed, I was too afraid that I’ll be never able to quit it, in the same time I was afraid that if I quit my intelligence and creativity will drop which will impact my life. One day I felt like I’ve had enough, it’s really impacting my life so badly, my productivity is so low, most of my money is spent on weed, and all I’ve got is ideas of things that I wanted to do without taking action. 
So, first week was quite hard, withdraws are clearly affecting my mood throughout the day, and I was having some depressive moments, Yoga really helped me, passing time in nature and having some physical activities had huge benefits on me, also sometimes I rolled tobacco joint, letting the placebo take place, I saved a lot of money so I bought a lot of new clothes, I’m seeing my productivity is really going up and now I have a far better relationships, I’m really enjoying life.
One thing I’m sure about is that my decision-making facility is quite suppressed after some period of daily weed consumption, when I was feeling like my intelligence was dropping after some days without weed, it was because you can’t be creative when your stressed and depressed, which is a natural consequence of stopping weed consumption, it’s nearly one month off and I barely think about weed.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.98394775390625}"

Over time I started to enjoy being high less and less, prompting the feeling that I should quit. Nevertheless I continued to smoke, and the latest phase has lasted since September. During this phase I began to binge on food a lot more, and only noticed the detrimental effects of my diet on my body very recently. I would easily wolf down a tub of ice-cream, or devour a whole bag of chocolates; behaviour that even my stoned self knew was unhealthy. But I felt powerless. I knew I needed to act on my feeling. 

I decided yesterday that I would stop for the unforeseeable future (at least until Februrary 2020) and today is day one. I stumbled upon this subreddit and was scrolling through posts, whilst eating a tub of ice cream (I suppose the sugar addiction from all that binge eating is something else to overcome). As I was reading everyone's posts, which flawlessly put into words my feelings towards weed that I could not articulate, something particularly odd happened... I licked clean a spoonful of ice cream, then looked down at the rest of the tub. 

""I've had enough,"" I thought to myself.

So I put the lid on the tub and returned it to the freezer. 

I had gotten so used to eating such huge portions, that I had forgotten the concept of not having to eat everything in one go.  

This is a seemingly small step on what will be an arduous journey to long term sobriety, but to realise an immediate effect of not being stoned has certainly spurred me forward. As someone who is usually health and physique conscious, I feel a small sense of liberation from my previous lifestyle which was hindering, and actively pulling me back from reaching my goals.

So thank you to this sub for introducing me to a community of people who seek to become liberated! I hope you all also have these small moments which remind you why you wanted to start this journey. Hopefully, after 1 month clean, I'll be able to look at the whole tub of ice cream and think, ""It's okay, I don't need this.""",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7447411417961121}"

While I haven’t fully committed to stopping permanent, for the first time since i’ve started i’ve become what i’d call a “occasional smoker”, smoking once every 2-3 weeks or so. I’ve purposely not bought more and have been very good about keeping it out of reach for myself. I do not seek it out and feel as if I could power through and never smoke again. 

I am, however, having some extremely tough side effects even weeks after stopping. Typically, i’d smoke right before bed every single night, and for that reason i’d fall asleep quite easily and not dream. Since i’ve stopped, going on over 3 weeks since my last time, i’ve become quite an insomniac. I am having a very difficult time getting to sleep, seeing as it’s 6am where I live at the time of posting. 

Even more concerning to me however, whenever I am able to get to sleep, I have extremely vidid and violent dreams. The past 3 nights now i’ve woken up in the middle of the night in a very poor state because of the content of my dreams. I just can’t seem to shake this- it’s been what feels like so long now since i’ve stopped and this is the only major thing that really makes me want to resume smoking. I have noticed positive changes in my life aside from this, but this problem is really starting to affect me physically (lack of sleep, and in turn sleeping in to ridiculous times when I do eventually nod off) and emotionally. The dreams have felt like they’ve only gained in intensity, and are really starting to bother me and I just want them to stop.

I have been feeling a ton of positives- more present in my relationships, way more willing to engage with people I meet, far more productive, not tired and sleepy all the time, huge increase in my appetite, motivation to be in the gym regularly, and the list goes on. **I will never go back to where I was at.**

I do have some lingering issues that I think are withdrawal related, hoping others here can relate?

**Health Anxiety:** this is far more controlled than it was in the first month, but it is the worst of my lingering symptoms still, for sure. I still feel like any weird physical symptoms I experience must be something sinister. I've been to a few doctors just to get my health checked as I completely neglected to do while I was smoking. All good so far, but I can't shake the feeling that some sort of serious illness is coming for me or growing inside of me right now. I plan to start counselling in the new year but I was curious, did anyone else have this issue linger for so long? Did it eventually get better?

**Digestion:** This one makes sense to me because of my drastic change in eating habits...I was eating 1-2 small meals per day the last few years and in the first couple months after quitting, I could not get enough food into me. This has levelled off now and I feel a regular amount of hunger. I went through some pretty serious constipation for a few weeks, resolved by upping my fiber intake and incorporating metamucil into my diet, but I still don't feel entirely ""normal"" in this regard. Anyone else's digestive system take a while to balance itself out?

**Acne:** I have always dealt with some acne on my face but about 2 weeks after quitting, my entire back, shoulders, chest and stomach started breaking out. It hasn't subsided. It has got to be pot related due to the timing, right? I started taking accutane last week to manage it but I was hoping someone else could relate to this one?

**Depression:** Most days I am feeling good. Definitely better than when I was smoking- I feel proud of myself and not guilty. But I am having a hard time getting excited about things...this is especially noticeable with the holidays in swing. I just don't feel happy. Laughing feels forced. My hobby was pot for such a long time, now I don't even know what I like any more, and as a result I've been putting all my energy into the gym- could definitely be worse but I want to find other things that interest me and that I can get excited about. I think this will just take some work. Did anyone else work through this? Any strategies would be super helpful.

Big thanks to all of you for helping me get to this point without losing my mind. **I want to live a full, healthy and rewarding life and though this has been one of the most difficult things I have gone through, quitting has been the most worthwhile and important step to becoming the person I want to be.**

I just wanted to stop by.

It's been over a year and a half since I stopped smoking weed. If you take a look at my post history, you will find that I was a multiple-times-a-day  smoker, and predominantly smoked bongs with tobacco and weed.

I just wanted to check-in and let everyone know that once you get to this amount of time without smoking weed, there is literally 0 desire to go back to it.

I never think of weed or getting high, I never think about what it used to be like when I was smoking weed. I can be around groups of people who are all smoking weed and feel ZERO desire to join.

I also have complete confidence that if I one day decided to smoke a joint with a friend, that I could easily prevent myself from relapsing and going back to my old ways of smoking every day, numerous times a day.

I beat the mental hold that weed had over me. I have quit for more than a year and a half. And it feels pretty fucking awesome to know this.

I was once a slave to weed and my addiction. I allowed weed and getting high to dictate my life; who I hung out with, where I went, what I did and at what time, and how I interacted with people.

Now, weed has zero hold on any part of my life.

I just wanted to stop in and let everyone know. It gets easier. Every day it gets easier. And it is worth it! Stop today. There is no time like right now.

With 2020 around the corner, use this as a measuring stick for your progress. Create a SMART goal (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound) and work towards it! Example: Stop smoking weed every day for 6 months and re-evaluate after 6 months!

I started dating someone amazing about 11 months ago. At the time, I had about one month of no smoking under my belt, and I told her upfront that I was in the process of quitting. I also told her that I might slip up because it was a hard journey. She said she would never date a smoker, and that she was glad I was quitting. She became my new best (non-smoking!) friend, and I developed into a stronger and better version of myself. It was the best version of myself that I'd experienced in the 16 years since I'd started smoking weed. 

11 months later I'm exhausted by how much time we've spent talking about her mental health issues and our relationship problems. She's got really bad anxiety, and we consistently spent 4+ days a week with her sobbing in my arms. We still have massive amounts of fun... but those moments are few and far between. 

About two weeks ago I couldn't take it any more and I broke up with her. I immediately started smoking every day and haven't been able to stop since.

She came back and convinced me not to break up with her, and she started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist.... and has really changed the way she acts around me. She's taking ownership of her problems. I don't know if it'll stick, but she's really trying.

However, I'm now smoking every day and pretty deep into a depressive funk. She gave me an ultimatum about not smoking, and made me promise to go cold turkey... but now I'm smoking secretly and lying about it.

In the past, going cold turkey hasn't worked for me. It's fucking hard (as you all know) and I prefer to make a plan on how I'll deal with different types of situations... and to not shame myself for smoking. It's a kinder, more accepting approach that I developed with the help of my therapist. 

Right now: I'm angry at her for giving me an ultimatum about smoking (even though she only wants the best for me). I resent that she wore me down over this year (even though her \*severe\* anxiety was out of her control). And I'm angry at myself for not being able to quit smoking. 

And so, here's the dilemma: 

I can't imagine quitting smoking under these circumstances. It seems impossible. The emotional burden of our daily conversations is too much. So I want to leave her for my own good... but I'm terrified of losing my best friend, and my most supportive person re: not smoking.

Every night. For three months. Until weed come back on your path, and its been a while so you think, why not? There we go. It’s better than drinking every night which started to affect your body. So you welcome it in your life gladly. A few months go by, in a different country where you don’t speak the language and without close friends or relatives. Getting stoned, alone, every day. Yeah I am feeling pretty darn depressed. Finally after 6 months I give in and go back home. It was good to be back. It is good to be back. But I feel like a failure. But was lucky to get a well payed job and it gave me a boost. 

I didn’t feel that bad anymore. I know what I want and I have the means to do it. I sign up to get my driver’s license and make plans to go back to school a second time. It’s been three years, and if I want to study full-time, it’s my last chance to do it. Took driving lessons for a year, during that time I enrolled for school, saved money and also signed up for addiction therapy which had a 6 months waiting list. Managed to be away from all substances (except sigarets) for 40 days straight during that waiting period. The trigger was when I failed the driving test a second time, I wasted 4K on it and didn’t have more money since school was starting. So was therapy.

Just before therapy and school started I went on a vacation I already paid for. It was a short city trip by myself. Back to the place I fled to and ended up leaving depressed. I wanted to see someone who was there for me at that time and also do some tourist things I never did while I was there. The most amazing thing happen and I had a encounter with someone…someone special. We exchanged numbers and went on a date. When I got back home, we stayed in touch and I fell in love. It felt so good. He is still amazing. But we can’t be together right now, it’s a whole other story. Anyway, I leaned on him a lot during treatment. He was my support. 

Therapy was okay. I did learn a few things, however I wasn’t fully committed to the treatment to be honest. I was cocky since I already managed to not use addictive substances for over a month by myself, without their help. A few weeks before treatment was over, I slipped back into the drift sand and didn’t tell my physiatrist. The trigger was the rock hard realization that I can’t be with the one I love. The first person that made me special, important and loved. Will be away for a long long time. 

Now I am here, more alone than ever, spending a lot of money that I don’t really have on weed. Have been like this for a few weeks now. I am slacking on school. Failed two exams last block. Which means that in January I have to make five exams in total. I have to change. I want the good part of me to shine in its rightful place. And I see how I have used external factors before to change but I realize now that it has to come from within. And fuck, it is fucking scary. 

I can’t do it.

I grew up around weed but never tried it until it was legalized. When it became legal I was also dealing with chronic pain so it seemed like a natural thing to try. I never felt out of control, but looking back now I was absolutely using it as a crutch.

The root problem is that everyone talks about weed like this panacea for all sorts of problems. And so that’s how I used it. Pain? Smoke. Stressed? Smoke. Can’t sleep? Smoke. Not hungry? Smoke. Bored? Smoke. But I was never addressing the root issues. It felt good short term but in the long run it made things worse, because weed reinforces all my worst tendencies. I never figured out how to smoke it socially. I’m naturally introverted, but weed makes me a total zombie. It made it okay for me to skip that event and stay in. It made it okay to not deal with my anxiety. It made it okay that I’m out of shape and trending down. Everything I thought weed was solving it was actually amplifying and compounding. 

I’ve also been struggling at my job. Which is unfamiliar to me, I was always an academic standout and an overachiever. For the last 6+ months I’ve just been in this fog. I’ve struggled with decision making and problem solving in a way that I’ve never felt before. And sure I’ve been dealing with other problems, and quitting won’t be a panacea either, but it will give me a chance to face my issues instead of ignoring them.

The kicker, and how I found this sub and realized I have to quit, is that last night I had a panic attack. Out of nowhere I felt my fight or flight kick in. I felt this dull ache in my heart, my pulse was racing. I was shivering. No amount of lying down or deep breathing let me feel normal. I’m too young to have a heart attack! I went to the ER because I was so freaked out and scared. All my vitals and everything came back good. But reading around this sub has made me realize that it was probably withdrawal. And weed is heightening my anxiety instead of relieving it. It’s harming my circulation. It’s sapping my motivation and intelligence. There are no upsides for me. So I’m quitting.

2019-12-19 15:16:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ecyq06/12_years_stoned_time_to_quit/,12 Years Stoned - Time To Quit," It's about time I quit-I have been saying that for the last 8 years 

I don't understand how I am so addicted to weed. I get zero benefits from it and countless life altering negatives. It costs me alot of money, it fucks up my health as I smoke joints, it strips away my personality or at least burys it and leaves me an anxious, quite recluse. 
I am scared to quit, but I don't know why because I have nothing to lose, I gain nothing from smoking weed other than a contempntess for a boring dull existence
In the  last few years I have developed a poly drug use habit. 
I take weed, benzos and amphetamine. 
The reason I take the latter 2 is simply to counteract the way weed makes me feel and the mindset it puts me in. 

Weed makes me very anxious, quite and lethargic. My job requires me to be the opposite of these, that's where the other drugs come in to it. I rarely smoke before work but I am always foggy and hungover from smoking the night before and it is very noticeable particularly if I am starting early. 

I don't take the drugs to go party or recreationally, I only ever take them to help me function at work, which has become all the time. I would not be where I am in my career if I had not developed this habit. If I had just stayed a stoner only, I would still be working at my old hotel job with no motivation or desire to change ( even if I did want change, I would be too high and fried to do anything about it) 

Amphetamines

Counteracts the lazyness, brain fog, lack of motivation and unproductivness. I don't take on days off work and take regular breaks. Dosage is low and just functional, has the odd effect of increasing my appetite which isn't typical but is good for me.

Benzos

Counteracts the anxiety and gets me out of my head. Makes me confident and not afraid to voice my opinion. I have had important presentations and events that I nailed that wouldn't have been possible without these. Take regular breaks and keep doses low and not daily. 

I am ashamed I have got to this state. I have known for many years weed is having a hugely negative impact on my life  but rather then quit I would rather take other drugs to allow me to carry on this ridiculous smoking habit.

Weed doesn't help me sleep-- in fact it does the opposite. It gets my heart going, thoughts going and definetly does not put me to sleep
I have friends who have smoked for a similar amount of time as me who are also quitting, but they don't have the same negatives. Weed actually makes them social and chatty whereas it makes me unsocial and turns me into a mute.
In the past before I developed the poly habit, I quit for a month several times and the effects were positive. I even had people who didn't know I smoke commenting on the positive change in my personality. I had no social anxiety and was feeling motivated and started to become productive and enthusiastic about life 
So I need to quit! 
But.... I have weed left (2/3 days worth) and promised myself once this is finished I will smoke no more. I am honestly terrified and I don't understand it. In the past 2 weeks I have only used weed as iv had time off work, the first week off the other drugs I felt abit low but back to my normal stoned self now.

I'm so confused at myself, why am I so reluctant to quit. I am 30 now and I'm at a crucial part of my career i have a great opportunity but it will not happen if I continue to smoke, i know I am passionate about what I do, but weed robs me of any passion so I just become apathetic towards everything. 
I am on a slippery slope as I can't keep taking all these drugs just to function. 

This post is jumbled, I am high and feel like I am permafried at the moment.

I’ve noticed a few things that are different this time compared with my prior attempt.

1. Last time I had still smoked a handful of times in the 42 days but I didn’t count it because it didn’t become a pattern. This time I didn’t smoke once.
2. Last time I knew if someone offered me weed I wouldn’t be able to say no. This time I’ve prepared for the holidays with my cousins and rehearsing in my head telling them no thank you, I’ve stopped smoking. I’m bound and determined to tell them no when I’m offered a smoke. 
3. Last time I didn’t believe I could actually stop smoking and be okay. This time I believe it because I can.

Anyone can stop using weed. It may take many attempts and that’s okay but it’s actually possible. You can’t give up. It requires a completely new thought process. For me, I had to find new coping strategies to relieve stress and anxiety that I smoked away for so long. I also had to get comfortable with being uncomfortable for a little while so I could learn this new normal. 

Long story short, you can do this. 
Thank you r/leaves for your never ending support and encouragement. I couldn’t do this without all of you.

It's been decades since I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, so I might be wrong, but I seem to remember that at the end, the portal to Narnia through the wardrobe closes up.

I had been nearly 6 months sober (lost track of which attempt this is, but I’ve been trying to quit for at least 5 years) when I allowed myself to be talked into going to the dispensary to get something for a friend. Of course they were having a buy one get one free special, and you know the rest of the story. With minutes the addict in my brain grabbed the wheel and I’ve been permanently blitzed for the last 5 months. Thankfully I had a work trip that forced a three day detox. While it sucked having to seem normal during that time (I blamed my weirdness on jet lag rather than literally not sleeping a wink for three days straight), it was a blessing. 

Every time I relapse, I’m terrified by how self destructive I can be. One minute I want the best for my life, then I see weed and I’d burn it all down just for that oblivion. And of course, I’ve always fucking HATED myself for that. 

During one of my sleepless nights I went down a youtube rabbit hole of watching Russell brand interviews where he talks about living with an addict in his head, and that fully clicked for me. It really is like a split personality kind of thing, which led to my epiphany. I hope this helps someone else too. 

What I realized is that I don’t hate myself because I’m an addict. I hate myself, *therefore* I’m an addict. The addict in me is only trying to help protect me from the constant barrage of criticism and emotional abuse I hurl at myself. I realized that if I treated another person the way I treat myself, it would be ridiculously abusive and fucked up. I’ve internalized this way of being from an extremely young age and so had never thought there was another way.

With that realization, all of a sudden I stopped seeing the addict as a destructive force who wants me dead, to a natural coping mechanism to a non sustainable way of being. When I hear of people with fucked up childhoods who are now addicts, I think “I get it, they needed something to help them cope.” And so now I’ve started to afford that same acceptance to my own coping mechanisms, which has allowed me to more honestly face the underlying issues I was avoiding.

So yesterday and the day before were really hard. I had convinced myself that life without weed is pointless, and that i was not able to enjoy myself without. The only thought that crossed my mind was the feeling of getting high and the cravings were extreme.It was late and i was already tired, so i went to sleep preparing to get high again the next day.

So i woke up, cravings were still very strong. I had to prepare a lot of things for my study and work and i was tired and only thinking about weed. High me would've skipped all the work and get weed. I felt motivated enough tho, to complete 1 out of 3 of my tasks. Then give up and get high. But then something changed, i was motivated enough to keep going, and the 1,5hour of work i scheduled turned into 6 hours. Completed all my tasks and was so surprised that it happened. If i didn't i would've been so stressed all throughout Christmas (as i usually am because high me is too lazy to take care of his sh\*t).  I walked out of the library and the sun was actually shining (-2degrees celsius but still, sun). My head was clear, my tasks were done, i can enjoy my holiday and the sun was shining. Honestly i know it sounds soooo cliche but this feeling is SO much better then any high has ever given me. Truly.

Anyways, i'm only on day 5 so there are going to be a lot of down moment coming, but im fine with that. I'm slowly changing into a stronger version of myself. 

The tunnel we are all in is; long, dark, foggy and cold. (another cliche) but somewhere, far far away, there is sunlight, a clear sky and happiness. Now I'm nowhere near but i'm much closer to it then i ever was. The road is long, we are going to feel horrible a lot of times. BUT IT WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER. 

I dont mean to brag about my day but I just hope it motivates at least one person, as it would do for me.

I am really happy, am going to cook my favorite dinner and watch my favorite team play tonight. I am going to enjoy life without weed, and its wonderful.

Physically, I feel nauseous all the time. No appetite whatsoever. I’ve already lost about 5 pounds (not healthy for me). I’ve been having horrible nightmares too.

Despite all of this, today seems to be a little bit brighter. I’ve got more of a handle on my emotions and I feel calmer. I also ate a bit of breakfast. Yesterday I did have a couple drinks to take the edge off, which was something I was trying to avoid, but alcohol isn’t really an issue for me so I don’t feel too bad about it. I also had a nice talk with my partner about how I was feeling and he was very supportive. He did suggest at one point that maybe it’s ok if I smoke a little, which sucked because then my mind started to go into what I call “towlie mode” (lol) where I start to justify it and think “we’ll maybe if I just get a little high..”. But I explained that I need to just stop and clear my head. He understood. Still haven’t smoked and still don’t want to.

Even the thought of food makes me shiver and feel more sick.

My reason for writing this post is because I’m heading out to a christmas party soon. It’s an annual thing and there will be drinks involved for sure. It’s 1pm, I haven’t eaten all day, but I know I NEED to eat something proper before I go out or I will get blackout drunk without trying.

I have been smoking weed from my early 20s, now I'm in late 20s. Sometimes it was regular thing to do, every day, few times a day. But for last two years it was different, there were periods of months without weed. So i wouldn't say that I'm avid smoker. during that period when i don't smoke I feel more rejuvenated, self confident, in touch with myself and my needs.

But after those periods pass,  somehow i make up for them in the coming weeks. If i didn't smoke for long period of time, i start to miss it and I'm not sure why, because afterwards i start to feel hazy, confused, not focused, lazy...all the things I don't like to be. I had some great times on weed but lately i feel like that's something that stands on my way to fully express myself. In social situations  I become super shy, soo much self conscious and overthinking simple conversations, anxious.

But i think that the bigger thing is that i don't feel comfortable anymore in the company of my longterm friend with whom i smoked most of the time during our friendship. During those periods without smoking weed I realized that her words and deeds don't match, that some things i said to her in confidence were told to other people, that she won't bother to reach me - I'm the one who always comes to her and initiates socializing. And i was always passive one, she would always talk the talk, speaking about conspiracies and shit about people i don't even know. i would just smoke and nod to that, even though i didn't share her opinions. What is worse, I stayed silent about things that I believe in, just to avoid conflict with her. To cut long story short, i suppose that weed is only thing that connects us now, and that knowledge becomes so unbearable and insincere both to myself and her. And i don't mean to put blame on her with this post, it's my responsibility who I spend time with..",32,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8289265036582947}"

I should be happy and celebrating, but instead I’m feeling guilty. 

I got drunk twice within this past week. I told myself it was fine to continue drinking while quitting weed because “I’ve never had an alcohol problem, I rarely ever drink!” but I was wrong. 

I’m an addict, it doesn’t matter what the substance is. If I know it will intoxicate me, I’ll use it in excess to get to that point. And then when I wake up sober, I’ll wanna do it all over again. 

I’m just so thankful I was able to recognize this before the drinking got really bad. It’s really not like me to get drunk twice in one week, which is what gave me the hint that alcohol could start to be a problem for me. I was just replacing getting high with getting drunk. 

I should mention that one of those drunken nights, I also ate 2.5g of  magic mushrooms and did a few lines of coke. Again, I told myself it was fine because “I’ve never had a coke or shrooms problem!” but I was wrong again. Just because I haven’t gotten to the point of using other substances 24/7 like I did with weed, does not mean I don’t have the ability to. I woke up the next morning craving more cocaine. I probably would’ve done more too if I had any on me (the stuff I did the night before, I had mooched from a total stranger at a party).

The first time I had a flashback moment after quitting I was crawling out of my skin. My life used to be bad. Domestic Violence and sexual assault left me open to moments of freaking out and drowning in anxiety when literally nothing was going on, a stranger could remind me of my ex who I havent seen in years and who is no longer a threat to me. I had no idea how much I had used pot to avoid feeling those feelings. The feeling of being at the mercy of someone elses unexpected violence. The feeling of being powerless. But I left that relationship over 5 years ago, and my life has been amazing for the last few years and I have worked so hard to get through my ptsd, I have a career, stability, confidence in myself... but every time I would start to get anxiety I would smoke weed til I calmed down... The thing is, I never actually experienced the anxiety to the end. I just used pot to disassociate from it. I had never actually listened to my body, never felt what I needed to feel... On the other end of it I realized I am capable of dealing with it, and instead of disassociation I am using those moments to remind myself that just because my body has anxiety over the memories of what happened to me, I am in no real danger. i am okay. I will never have to live through that again and reliving it now is just a false flag going off and I can hold onto that, it is just a ghost that is finally beginning to fade from existence. I don't have to escape those moments and in the last 20 days I have been in a few situations that would have left me shaking and reaching for weed to take myself away from... And the anxiety is gone. I am in control. I can take care of myself and make logical, good decisions in regards to my boundaries and safety.

I have been smoking for 6 years and have jumped from the sober to the relapse bandwagons more than I can keep track of. Weed has seen me through immense depression the past few years and now an ADHD diagnosis at 27. 

I walked by a dispensary today after running an errand. It took all of my physical being’s willpower to not go inside and buy a joint. I instead went into the neighboring drugstore and restocked on toiletries to make myself feel better. 

I ended up spending more there than I would have if I went into the dispensary. And this sent me in to a huge spiral of negative emotions. I spent the rest of the evening dwelling on these 20 mins and crying about why I didn’t just go in and buy the joint! UGH!

Here is what pulled me out of this spiral (a little):

1. I talked through all the emotions I was feeling with my husband. While frustrating at first, it eventually got me to my third point in this list. 
2. Cuddled my dog and cried hard, apologizing to him for being such a garbage parent. 
3. I realized I still had my clothes and socks on so I was literally READY to leave to go buy again. But I went for a hot shower sobbing, and changed into my pajamas to prevent myself from trying to leave (it is currently -11 degrees Celsius outside where I am)

I’m still feeling pretty shitty, but I am happy I was able to get myself to the point where i can write about this journey today :) 

To my mind: please be kinder to me.. 😢

I feel mad depressed, whether it's because of weed, the darkness or the other events i've been through this year, I don't know. But also, these events was the reason I decided to quit from the beginning so it hasn't all been bad I guess. 

I never realized how boring my life was without weed, weed just let me ignore the ""boringness"" I guess. 

I'm doing my best to cope with this shit, meditating, being out as much as I can, cold showers, looking at the reasons why I quit from the beginning. But right now it's just so tough.

Basically, I've never suffered from anxiety or depression until I started having some panic attacks after smoking weed daily for the last 6 years or so, I'm thinking the backwoods definitely didn't help and those were my favorite. This all started about 2 months ago and has gotten worse, I was trying to quit (got up to 5 days) but then caved just to hit my pen a couple times before bed. So since then, I've started taking Lexapro, which I've read takes about a month or two to level you out, but with the side effects from that, and the tapering from weed, I feel like a mess. I actually stayed home from work today, again, and was feeling like shit until i hit my pen at noon, which i haven't done in weeks, and I had a lot of relief and was able to be introspective. Don't know if that's a cop out but it's true, with the anxiety and depression I've been suffering from, I can't tell what thoughts are rational or not, and weed seemed to quiet the background noise for a bit.

Guess I'm asking if 1, anyone's felt similar or been here before? And 2, how terrible would it be for me to keep smoking until these side effects from the medicine diminish?",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9964507818222046}"

I was in a very dark place a year ago. And I finally decided I was going to get sober after years of daily abuse. Here is the thing, when you hit rock bottom, it's the worst feeling, but it gives you clarity. I knew I didn't want to see myself in that situation ever again, so it gave me a lot of strength to go all the way. I managed to spent the first six months of the year without using.
And I want to tell you about those six months. Because they were the best months of my life. 
And you can get there too. 
I know at first everything sucks very hard,
and it's pretty difficult to imagine how much better your life will look a few months into the future. It's way easier to imagine using again.
So I want to tell you about those months, to help you imagine all that you can achieve, to motivate you towards your goal. 
I was pure will power. Nothing scared me, going back to weed didn't even cross my mind.

I was exercising, eating healthy, going out to nature, walking a lot, meeting people, and having so much fun. I had this crazy ability: I was able to tap with myself and feel happiness whenever I wanted. Just to be able to live in the moment, to be myself, and to feel as sharper and stronger than ever, it made me incredibly happy. I was a hundred percent confident and loving myself. And eveyone around me noticed, even people that didn't know me before. People started looking at me as an example of discipline and willpower.
For me that was just insane. I used to identify with such awful things, totally the opposite of what people thought of me. It was just not real. 
I am an addict, and I think that is for life. I know I can't control it, it controls me. I can't smoke, not now or in 20 years. Because as soon as I start, I start to lie to myself and lose control over it. That's what happened at the seventh month. I found weed walking in the street, and I took it. And six months later I'm back at day one. But now I know, I have this real vision of how life looks like without weed. And let me tell you it's unbelievable good, it's better than any high you can get. You will feel reborn. But be aware, you are always susceptible to go back to the dark days, no matter how strong or confident you feel.
Keep it strong people!! We will get there.
Bless you all for everything you do.
Much love!",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9986327290534973}"

Things were always so hard for me, and I'm not going to pretend that quitting weed fixed all my problems, but it certainly made it easier to do that myself.


Weed seeps into your identity. I realized a lot of the people I considered friends were just there because they don't want to get high alone. They didn't call me to spend time together, they called me to get high together. Now I have more sober friends. I have friends that want to be around me because our personalities complement one another. And that's so fulfilling.


I'm not wasting time packing bowls, waiting on a flaky dealer, walking into a room and looking around trying to remember what I was doing. It all adds up, and time is too precious to be wasted chasing artificial and temporary relief. 


I have used this freed up space in my identity to do a lot of self reflection. I started writing more songs and focusing on guitar, really confronting some of the personal issues I was facing through art. Made some self discoveries and... I just feel way more like myself.


I hope everyone that is striving to quit keeps at it. I hope that whatever you're self medicating for, you find a healthy way to heal. Or if you're not self medicating, I just hope you reach your goal.

Today was a tad weird, woke up super tired after waking every hour of the night in cold sweats, bit hazey at work which I wasn't expecting I felt like I wasn't working as hard as I normally would

Urges are controllable, talking to my housemate about weed made me briefly want to smoke but I quickly remembered why I don't want to anymore and I was okay

I feel okay I guess, I saw a YouTube video of a guy doing 100 pushups for 30 days last night and as I've already got myself into the habit of doing a lower number of pushups every day in my precious attempt to quit, I'm going to attempt this, Holy jeeeez 100 pushups is harder than I thought, got to 90~ and was laying on my chest for 5 minutes lol. Exercise definitely helps though and I highly RECCOMEND that anyone trying to quit considers taking up exercise.

Meditation is another one that's helped a lot. Again I've got myself into the habit of meditating a month ago when i tried to quit, so it's a part of my daily routine now and has helped an awful lot with helping me controlling my emotions, which I was neglecting when I was smoking 

I feel fully equipped to tackle this addiction this time, even if I've failed multiple times before I believe this time more than ever, and making myself accountable through these posts helps

Coming up again on 47 days, the same amount of clean time I relapsed last time. Been having thoughts of hitting up a dispensary to buy some edibles or a vape cart. I know I don’t want to do this. I need to be clean to get a good job as an RN. I can’t keep working shitty jobs the rest of my life.

I was someone who liked to smoke every day at the end of the evening. I have a good job, I have been training for more than 10 years, but for the past year, I have found that weed blocked my emotions. I was often locked in my room playing Xbox or wasting my time alone at my computer. (btw I'm 28 years old)

I completely decided to stop cold turkey and I thought it was going to be more difficult than that, but I am already seeing benefits from it.

Here they are :

* Mental clarity
* No more brain fog in the morning
* My sleep is so much better (when I was smoking, I was sure that weed helped me with my sleep pattern; wrong)
* No more social anxiety
* I do look healthier (no more bags below the eyes.)
* My skin seems better too
* In the gym, I can definitely do more cardio without rushing
* I like to speak to people now (can maintain eye contact)
* Short term memory is coming back and this is insane
* I have more free time to do what I want
* I'm more positive
* I can face everyday problems now without anxiety
* More money to do more activities

&#x200B;

These are the ones I'm thinking of right now. However, there are some things I wish I could change.

* I lost interest in video games, which I liked to do when I smoked.
* My friends who I smoked with are now ""gone"" because I can't stay with them being high and me being sober.
* Music was so damn good while high. Now, I just don't want to take time to listen to music anymore.
* Weed helped me decompress during stressful moments. Now I have to find a way to empty my mind otherwise.

&#x200B;

Obviously, there is much more positive than negative. I do not want to start smoking again because I have lost the taste and I am much better about myself. One piece of advice I can give to people trying to quit: take it one day at a time. There is no point in setting big goals for example: I want to stop for 3 months. It will be too easy to start smoking again and tell yourself that you'll try again later. One day at a time. You will feel more rewarded at the end of the day than waiting the full 3 months.

I hope I am able to motivate a few to not let go or start this process of completely stopping the weed. When you're on the right track, you're going to rediscover yourself and oh god you'll like what you see.

I’ve lost friends, jobs, opportunities, experiences, and my biggest regret, I was never able to finish college. All because of weed. 

So I quit, I even got through day one! The withdrawal symptoms are starting to get annoying, I swear I can barely think straight, but this is what needs to happen.

I can for sure say every day for 6 months, but it may have been a month longer. Before I quit, I was up to at least a quarter to almost half an ounce a week. Frankly, I'm not sure if that's heavy enough to cause withdrawal symptoms this bad, but I started feeling like absolute dogshit since.

To start, I had near constant, excruciating headaches. So bad that I went to the hospital to get a CT scan that fortunately came up clear (In fact, the rest of my vitals have been consistently good). I've had times where I can feel my own heartbeat and blood, and auditory hallucinations that have been make me panic throughout the day. Sometimes, I feel like my scalp is on fire.

The headache was mostly, if not entirely gone yesterday and it was insane how blissful it was at times. I say ""at times"" because I still have moments of feeling intense anxiety and have to keep myself from panicking throughout the days. I still pace my apartment, my neck and body still feels sore most of the time, and I still get a brief moment of a sharp pain followed by a few minutes of it being dull. The insomnia is the worst part of it. The feeling is like being trapped in a constant loop of feeling okay and then completely forgetting those moments when I feel worse. Even as I type this, I feel a fleeting pain and anxiety about what it *could* be that makes me want to scream despite all signs (and multiple physicians) pointing to withdrawal.

Regardless, I plan to stick to giving this up. It feels fucking terrible, and I wouldn't wish this on anyone else but I know it'll be worth it. Honestly, I just can't wait to sleep normally again.

What I mean was that life gave me a big test yesterday and I survived without even wishing I had weed, let alone going out and getting it (which would have been pretty easy as it's legal here in Canada)

Some background - I purchased a new car just 8 days ago. I have only driven it three times, and one of those times was driving home from the car dealership. It has been parked since Friday in my reserved parking spot in front of my house (I own a condo).

Yesterday afternoon I was in the kitchen cooking dinner when the doorbell rang.  It was my neighbour who came to inform me that some brain-dead idiot had crashed into the back of my new car!  Needless to say I freaked out - I have only driven about 40KM (about 25 miles) on it and now it has a big dent in the back and a cracked bumper.  

I had cashed in an investment certificate and paid out 35 grand for a new car, only to have it smashed up by some bozo who doesn't know how to drive on ice. And I wasn't even in the car when it happened! 

Under ""normal"" circumstances I would have needed to smoke several grams after an event like this in order just to calm down.  But, amazingly, the thought of weed didn't even occur to me. I was mad all night (and still am) , but I managed to calm down and, of course, the insurance will cover everything.

And while I wish the incident had never occurred and I still have the hassle of getting the damage appraised and the bodywork done I am PROUD of myself for not caving and heading to the SQDC to pick up a few grams to numb myself.

I’ve read a lot about marijuana’s effect on the brain - particularly how it really screws up your dopamine levels and your reward response. That’s one of the major reasons why you could have rebound depression and anxiety after you quit smoking weed.

But I never really thought about how my usage of pornography could be negatively impacting my brain and my life until very recently. Over the last few days I’ve been reading a lot of articles about how using porn can also really mess up your dopamine levels. 

Porn addiction and marijuana addiction seem to have a lot in common. Users report depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, social isolation, no interest in socializing or dating, etc. as a result of porn addiction. In the same way that we use marijuana as a temporary escape from a depressing and unsatisfying reality, a lot of people use pornography for the exact same reason. It turns out that they both have very similar effects on dopamine levels. 

Also, like marijuana, it’s extremely prevalent in our society and culture, and it’s becoming increasingly socially acceptable. So unlike say cocaine or heroin, marijuana and pornography are much more acceptable parts of our culture. There’s even a real lot of propaganda out there that tries to tell people that weed and porn are actually healthy for you. I’m not trying to demonize either or say that either should be illegal. Not saying that at all. It’s just that these two industries are very heavily marketed to people nowadays. It reminds me of how cigarettes were marketed as healthy in the past.

I no longer feel constantly disconnected from my surroundings, I don't feel like a shell of a person and most importantly, my physical health has improved massively. 

I didn't know how anxious the daily smoking was making me, it was impacting my thoughts massively yet I couldn't even see it. As cliche as it sounds, I really had no idea who I was, and I felt as if weed was the only part of me that I truly knew about. 

It turns out weed was an overbearing security blanket, which was preventing me from seeing the other parts of myself that I once loved and identified with. It stopped me from being able to connect with the people around me, and it hindered my self growth and progressing in my hobbies and education. I feel my self control returning, for example I am now 19 days free from smoking tobacco, and my impulses are become less frequent, and much more manageable. 

I allowed it to take so much of my time away, but this past month I've completed transformed as a person, and I feel more able to listen to my emotions, as well as listening to other people as well. Not only has the change been recognised by myself, but my boyfriend too. He's very proud that I stopped so suddenly, and I'm incredibly grateful for his support too. 

I truly am grateful that I quit so suddenly, and that I was able to follow through with my decision. Life has got better, and I am improving every day. I feel much more appreciative of my life, and I don't think I will ever return to smoking weed daily again. Experiences are brighter, I don't want to hide myself away, and even though I still have a long way to go, I know how important it is to recognise the progress I have made.

2019-12-16 08:22:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ebf2tn/mind_over_matter_proof/,Mind over matter - proof,"Hi guys 

I posted in this forum a couple of months ago asking for advice and determined to quit. I was a heavy smoker and extremely dependent on weed! I felt miserable without it yet somehow more miserable whilst smoking it but as many of us know it was a dullness that was somewhat more enjoyable and addictive than life’s raw and real emotions 

I tried to quit many times but never could I even took a trip to Amsterdam since posting and smoked until my heart was content. I returned to London thinking that would be the end, I would stop and start to get myself together. I knew my career was suffering, my memory was bad and my motivation / drive was NON EXISTENT. 

I knew I couldn’t afford to keep buying it. I felt disappointed in myself yet I continued to smoke. Daily. I actually got to the point that I honestly believed I was one of the people who simply couldn’t quit, it felt impossible.

Fast forward to now and I haven’t smoked or even thought about weed in just over 14 days. No “I wish I could smoke right now” thoughts, not even a craving??  It’s like it never even existed. Well what changed?

I found out I was pregnant & instantly just like magic I stopped. Now I know not everyone here will be able to stop due to being pregnant lol BUT hear me out as I feel there’s a deeper message here....

The way the brain and mind is wired. At the moment weed is all you think about, it’s become the number one most important thing in your life and the most dominant thought in your brain, this is why I found it so hard every time I tried to quit. Finding out I was pregnant made me quit but not simply because I was pregnant - my mind switched in that moment 

I went from thinking about weed to thinking about what I’m going to do with my life, can I handle being a Mum at 26 etc etc my mind suddenly cleared out the weed and replaced it with something more important. My mind has re organised things in order of importance so it’s no longer present as a thought. I honestly have been so busy thinking about the baby I haven’t had ONE thought about weed which I can’t believe I’m saying.

So I guess I’m saying the phrase “mind over matter” really is true. The key here is your mind. Find something to replace those thoughts and knock them down a bit from the position they are in now. If it’s the fact you want to be healthy make that a burning thought, practice thinking about that thought, make it your reality.

I hope this makes sense? I just think there’s a lot of power in our minds and we hold the power ultimately over how we process our thoughts. 

I had become so defeated I had allowed my mind to run my life even if it was leading me to my demise. I admit I had it easy as being pregnant forces  a lot of thoughts into your brain. Without that sudden  shock it may have taken me a while to replace the weed but it is possible. 

You can find your equivalent of what’s important and with hard work (or not depending on what your motivation is) replace weed with another driving force.

If it’s your kids having more time with you make that your number one thought, really practice and train yourself to hold that thought. Place reminders if needed. If it’s the fact that you feel you have wasted your life you must forgive yourself first as the mind won’t let go otherwise, then you can begin to envision the person you know you want to be. Really envision it and make it the number one thought in your brain until eventually you will see things re-order.

Distract yourself, get busy, force yourself to replace the old thoughts with new ones.

She's a health practitioner and had her reservations about smoking but at the end of the day she respected my independence to make my own decisions. Knowing that she was adverse to it though, I begun hiding the fact that I was smoking at night after she would go to bed. 
The dishonesty was a lot to keep up with out of fear that she would be dissappointed with me, and I always figured it only effected myself and what she didnt know couldn't hurt her.

Today during an argument about how I keep things bottled up and unload on her I told her sincerely that I wanted us to still be strong together, and she said she did too but not like this.

That's when it clicked with me that in order for me to have the relationship I wanted I needed to come clean. In order to feel like I can tell what what I feel when I'm feeling it, I cant keep a secret like that from her. I told her that I was still smoking and she was very upset. Not at the smoking, but that I felt that I needed to lie to her for over a year even with living together. I feel horrible. I put myself and something not as important in priority over my relationship. 

I could have just stopped and not told her but I'm happy I told her, shes not leaving me but we're just sitting in our living room and were both upset. I'm mortified with myself that I wasnt just lying to her but to myself thinking it wasnt a problem. It will be a rough road ahead, both with stopping the green and with repairing our relationship. But I'm all in, and regardless of how we turn out, I know I made the right decision.

The first time I got high I was 14 and it was at a concert. For me it made the music so much better and I really felt the song coursing through my veins. Without hesitation, I started buying weed and smoking semi regularly. My brother had connects so it was never an issue for me to get weed, if I had money I got high. Weed made me incredibly creative, started writing songs and practicing guitar a lot more, Made food taste amazing, made everything funny, and the best part about it for me was it got rid of the emotion of boredom. I started really liking it and smoking much more now, about 1G-2Gs a day, and if I had the money I would smoke more. I could easily out smoke people double my age, which is not okay for a 15 year old to do. 

From the age of 14 to my 16th birthday, everything was a blur. My short term memory is horrid even when I’m sober, you can imagine how much of a bumbling idiot I was when I was high. I always felt stupid, but I never did anything about it cause weed always let me not give a fuck about anything.

After about a year and a half of smoking I started dabbling with acid. I tripped about 3 times, and that last trip was one of the most scary things of my life. Still gives me the chills to think about it. That trip was may of this year.

Around June, I started to notice that weed was different. Started seeing spots in the air, visual snow, migrantes, depersonalization, geometric figures in the dark and terrible night vision. So I decided  to take one day off for a T break. Next day I woke up and it was still there, when I was sober. Smoked again and it became worse. Then I took a week off of smoking and on my 16th birthday I lit my last bowl ever and it felt like I took acid. I later found out that I have a disorder called Hallucinogenic Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) HPPD is triggered by taking acid and having prolonged visual effects long after the trip. If you want to learn more visit the r/hppd sub, really amazing stuff on there.

The first week was hell. the psychological withdraws, dealing with my new found disorder, and the fact that my dad smokes, my brother smokes, my sister works at a dispensary and her and her boyfriend have nearly turned the white paint on their house green, honestly it nearly drove me to suicide. But I’m happy to say that I made it out, and my 6 months is on December 30th.

One final thing I want to say about weed. I believe that it doesn’t make you a better person, it doesn’t make you more creative or productive or happy contrary to what everyone in my life believes. It’s just a high. All of that stuff can be found within yourself if you actually put the time and effort into your hopes and dreams. Don’t numb yourself to get away from your Demonds, face them head on in a healthy way so you can become a better person from them.

Back then I didn’t feel like I needed it I just did it to have fun and it really fueled my creativity. I would say it all changed when I was with my last girlfriend about 2 years ago. I haven’t had a lot of relationships and she smoked too but not as much as I did so when she told me I had to stop, I said okay cause I didn’t want to loose her. So I did and I stopped smoking pot and cigs for a month. That’s when she just broke my fucking heart, she told me that I wasn’t popular enough to date her and that “This isn’t a movie where the geek gets the cheerleader”, I was destroyed by this. That night I called my friends and I smoked an entire pack of cigs by myself and started to smoke weed again to feel anything at all.

This time was one of my most successful having stayed clean since September 20th up to Thanksgiving where I decided to start looking at r/oilpen and r/weed for whatever stupid reason and I relapsed. Times have been tough with my mom being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, fatty liver, and heart problems. Prior to the relapse I told myself I would control it to the point of smoking where I wouldn't withdraw when I stopped and well we all know what what was gonna happen. I stopped again now that my dad found my pen after I had it in my sweater pocket when I slept in the couch and it fell to the side when I stood up and forgot about it. Withdrawals suck and really intervere with studies so I'm planning to smoke enough to not get withdrawals maybe until finals are over and go through the withdrawals on winter break, 2 weeks so it should get through the worst of it.

I'm new to the community, I've been smoking on and off since I was about 16? This time I only smoked for a month and a half (I was smoking roughly 2.5-3g a day), As of recently I've decided I don't want to be high all the time anymore and made the decision to quit. I've went through marijuana withdrawal my fair share of times, but this time the symptoms are the worst they've ever been. My list of symptoms goes: Rapid body temperature regulation changes, awful insomnia (I can't seem to fall asleep, and when I do it's only like I'm half sleeping half awake. ), no appetite, anxiety is through the roof, flu like symptoms, etc, etc. Pretty much everything there is to have go wrong minus violent puking.

So the first two days I was able to fall asleep fine, but after that I'm not sure what happened. I couldn't fall asleep for 40 hours (Throughout those 40 hours I probably tried to sleep 20? times) , when I finally did I slept 9 hours (very interrupted), and now I'm up again for 26 hours. I've experienced every one of my symptoms except for this one previously. Obviously I've had insomnia but never to this extent. I'm not sure if I'm just having ridiculous anxiety attacks or what, but I'm considering going to see my doctor. (I can tell him that I'm withdrawing from marijuana without having to worry about him telling my job, right?) I'm in Pennsylvania.

Do you think that this is all just the marijuana withdrawal? Or do you think that I should see a doctor?

P.S. Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, I'm really worried and anxious right now.

Everyone will. It is unavoidable. It is the most basic human nature.

I’ve read a lot of your posts and so many of you are having the exact same problem as me. You’re trying to quit weed but your entire group of friends are still die hard stoners. Oh man, I can relate to that.

I’m 32 and I started smoking around age 14. Been smoking for 18 years, addicted for 12. Since freshman year of high school most of my friends and friend groups have consisted of stoners. We would smoke weed all day long. This lasted well into my adulthood. If it wasn’t one group of stoners, it was another. If it wasn’t one stoner dude I was dating, it was another stoner dude. 

When we ran out of weed and couldn’t get any, the whole entire interaction became wasting literally hours and hours desperately trying to score weed. Bickering and fighting about who brought the weed the last time and who smoked up who. Don’t get me wrong, there were definitely good times and fun times I had with these people. But the thing is, you truly can have just as much fun sober as you can if you’re high, without all the drama and time wasted and who smoked up who bullshit. 

It really got me wondering, are these people really my friends or does our whole entire so called “friendship” really just revolve around getting high? I came to realize that these people weren’t really my friends and that they were very toxic people. And because I was hanging out with them, I was becoming a toxic person too. 

I realized that if I am serious about quitting, getting sober, and getting my life together - I have to cut these people loose. I’m not blaming them for the choices that I made. I take personal responsibility for my own choices. But I also know that you will inevitably become like the people that you surround yourself with. 

Ending a relationship, cutting off a friendship or leaving a group of friends is never easy. It is really hard! But its the hardest decisions that move us forward the most. If you want to be happy, healthy, successful, and sober - you have to surround yourself with people who are that way too.

I don't even think I had any pretence that I could 'manage' it this time. It was just straight up self-destruct mode. My relationship is now in tatters, my health has gone down the drain and my studies have been severely affected. All because of weed. Some might not be as bad as I am when it comes to unhealthy habits surrounding cannabis. For me, I don't just get stoned, I also stop drinking water, stop eating food, stop sleeping - I just lie in my bed re-watching boring TV series that I don't even like for days on end, avoiding my housemates at all cost and feeling generally pretty terrible. My back starts to hurt from lying down too much and my head starts to pound until eventually I just roll over with the lights on fully clothed and fall asleep. 

Quitting weed is the hardest thing I've ever had to do and I've never made it past 4 months despite quitting maybe 20 or so times. I was reading another post by someone who's quit for 2 years who said that the first year was pretty hard but that it gets better. This is extremely encouraging and it would be great to hear from more people who have quit for a long period of time. This community has been really helpful in the past, particularly because it's very hard to open up about this stuff with people in my life because all of the stoners I know are in complete denial and all of the non-stoners don't get it, or I feel too ashamed and embarrassed to talk about the realities of addiction to them.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9953243136405945}"

I told her that I can't quit unless she does too, because I literally have no craving of it all day until I literally see and smell it 3 feet from me. We have gotten into some arguments about it. I know I should be stronger and not need to rely on others to stop habits in myself. But its...hard.

I bring up the heroin argument which is extreme but to me makes sense

So basically when you see a heroin junkie couple addicted and one finally wants to get help they are never going to get help with their partner using heroin right in front of them all the time. It's only when they get out of the situation and escape that person can they finally start to take back control, or if they somehow agree to quit together they could be extremely supportive systems for each other.

Now that is extreme and weed isn't heroin. I'm not going to break up or anything over this. I just wanted to hear peoples opinions or experience if they have dealt with something similar to this.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9459530711174011}"

I’ve not particularly abused weed or ever been a daily smoker.  But it’s been a few months now where I haven’t smoked, not particularly because I told myself I wanted to quit, it just wasn’t fitting into my life.  Among my friends I started being more aware I was associated with all things weed and don’t just want to be known for that alone.  

But as of late, I’ve been watching it pull apart people around me that otherwise should be close and I’ve decided I’m done with it myself.  We don’t notice it when we use it ourselves but it absolutely brings people down. Tonight I was in an environment where normally I would have smoked, but I saw how others were and I was happier without it. I’ll wake up tomorrow for work clear headed and without the lingering thought of another night of lighting a spliff.  I also didn’t feel like I was just drifting through the socializing process.  When you’re sober and talking to the people that are really high, it was honestly somewhat of a turn off.  

Just one small step of self awareness and betterment I hope.  

I can say I also unsubscribed from r/trees I don’t think I’ll be needing to look at what’s going on over there any more.  

Next step, sell off my vaping devices. That should finalize my decision on the matter.  

Next item to drop is the nicotine addiction if I can call it that.  I enjoy vaping, mostly for the flavors and passing of time while I drive or do other tasks.  Never high concentration. But I also on occasion smoke a pipe or cigar.  I don’t think I particularly crave it, but I don’t have the desire to quit it either.  Time will tell where I go on that journey.  Finding that spark that inspires you to change or quit can be one of the hardest parts I think.

But I just didn’t buy again. Which was weird because usually as soon as I ran out (or even before I did) I had to buy more or I would freak out. But I haven’t.

I’ve had thoughts of buying more on really hard days, but somehow I don’t. And somehow, weirdly, it’s not that hard to decide I won’t.

The thing is I wish I knew what had changed in me but I don’t. I’ve smoked 2-3x since, only ever with friends when we go out and drink and then come home and they offer me some, but somehow I still havent bought any. Its a bit scary because weed was such a big part of my identity for so long but all of a sudden cold turkey it’s not. Has anyone been through something similar?

My only worry is that I have been drinking a bit more than I used to, but at the same time when I used to drink I would binge and blackout, whereas now I drink less and remember everything (I’m going to do dry January, I just worried that cutting both out at the same time would result in a relapse of both). 

Sorry for the wall of text, but basically I’ve saved so much money on food since I stopped smoking, on top of the money I would’ve wasted to get high. When I smoked I would go buy a ton of groceries, eat them for a meal, and then spend money on fast food for days, buying whatever junk my munchies told me I wanted that day, meanwhile all the food in my fridge went bad/got thrown out. Now I work at a restaurant with AMAZING food but somehow haven’t bought a meal there in over a week because I remind myself of the food I have in the fridge. It’s weird. Can anyone here relate?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976058006286621}"

TL/DR: Just passed 10 months green free, with my initial target 1 sober year to see whether I can be back to normal mentally. So happy to find this community, you all help me to fight addiction.

(Excuse me for the grammar please, English isn't my native language) I'm in mid-40ies, with family, good career in perspective industry, consequently above average income. Have been struggling with too heavy usage at least for the last 5 years. I was already forced to quit at my 21, due to some short term psychosis development with depersonalization syndrome. The latter made me so scared I didn't want to touch any mind altering stuff for 2 years, including coffe and alcohol free beer. I thought I had a brain tumor, turned out I physiologically in perfect shape. My left eye vision was blurred for no reason and my smell was way too sensitive for some occasion. For e.g. I could smell opioids burning 2 floors above/below my position, anytime, as it made me sleepless. I knew when a particular ""H addict"" was in action. Twenty years after I still avoid duty-free-shops at the airports due to heavy scents making me headaches. When I look back, the reason was probably too much stress on my body, with  drug experimenting and too abundant sport activity. At the same time, there was - back of my mind - psychological stress how to transition from worry free high school life to an responsible adult.  I was actually lucky to get into DP issue as it made me changed my lifestyle, I made me focus into colleague and pursue carreer. I grew a big family and build a house, I had a constant progress in career. Until I was too bored... So after 10 years break I started again. That was 10 years ago. You know how it goes, every second weekend, occasionally at home, then it had creep over me just to end in daily usage as I had weed at my hand anytime. Probably there was slight depression again - from young adult to older one, with growing kids - I'm mortal, there is no heaven, what the hell my life is ending into - kind of thoughts. And weed makes you not too worry about it, until you realized you smoked off through 5 years of life... I had very occasional weekly breaks, with the longest being 2.5 months.

I still have weed at my disposal, a few jars, well cured.   That's the way I always want to stop. Neither its smell, neither its sight, neither its immediate availability, neither any bad day, nothing should persuade me to use it, when I don't want to. And I well remember the good part of enjoyment is just perhaps short term. And I know, its only a deceiving perception, you think everything - food taste, music, playing an instrument - is better, although it's not. Also, it's quite awkward situation, if not sad, when I'm now in company of old friends, when they smoke and are stoned, they become slowed down and happily entangled in their own mind. It's no fun actually. 

First 3 months were all over the place, from aggressive to depressive. Though, I liked the life-like dreams, except those where you relapse (on those you are happy when you wake up sober). Isn't it impressive that our minds can recreate stoned feeling super accurately, without any THC in the body? This made me believe, my mind can help me to recreate any good feeling without any drugs. Anyway, even after 10 months I still don't feel the same compared to my past full shape mentally. Maybe as I'm older, I would conclude this better after 24 months. I drink coffee quite much and very occasionally alcohol - it's not my type of drug. I do sports regularly.  Sleep is superbly refreshing and I don't need external stimulation to enjoy food. With a great satisfaction I can follow  movies and read books in entirety and then make a profound introspection about the content. Still, I feel like I need to learn to concentrate my thoughts even better - somehow I can easily return into that blurred out state of mind induced by chronic weed consumption.

I quit bc I'm about to have an adhd evaluation and I have to be clean for that. It is also illegal where I live.
After reading posts here I can't help but to feel isolated. Let me explain; I have always hated myself to the core. I am a high-achiever and an academic but I have always felt rotten and ugly. I struggled all my life with motivation regarding the even the most everyday things like hygiene. I would have to work up enough energy to even take a shower and I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 8 or 9.

Weed changed all that. Suddenly I found myself beautiful and worthy of love. I could do chores with ease and my mood was so much better overall. I started working out and eating healthy and felt like a capable person. 

Now I'm back to feeling like the same old low-life piece of shit my depression always told me I am. How come everyone else feel so great and I'm just a mess of a person? 

I really don't feel like it's worth it and I'm only pushing through to prove a point. But then what? Am I supposed to feel like nothing forever just to be ""sober""? Can anyone relate to this?",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6572777628898621}"

So, we locked my stuff up, shook hands that it was what I wanted, and so I tried my best.

The first night was hard, but the second night was unbelievable. The cravings wouldn't stop, and I caved. And this morning, I feel relieved.

The whole two days I was living in fear of messing up. Feeling so strongly that I wouldn't be able to get back on the wagon. But now that it's the next morning, I'm sitting here and I know I can do it again. If you can do something once, you can do it twice. Everything is always easier the second time around, as long as you love yourself and don't let your lapses be anything but teachable moments.

I've been looking into meditation, and they talk about clearing your mind by focusing on breathing. But, if you realize that you forgot your breathing, and are now thinking other things, you should smile and focus again on your breathing, because you have just returned to where you want to be.

I would love to be on day 100 already, but the place I want to be isn't some distance away. The place I want to be is a place where I'm quitting weed and trying my best at it, because that's all I can ask for.

And so, if you're scared of failure or ashamed of your last failure, know that failing isn't resetting progress, but it's furthering it, just like resisting a craving every day strengthens you. As long as you give your all, that's all you can ask for.

This is like my 6th  time quitting. My heaviest period was about the last 3 years ago where  I'd smoke all day everyday and not do anything with my life. Longest  quitting streak, as far as I can remember is around about 190 days or  so.    


I recently moved  out of my hometown, I stepped outside my comfort, I realised people were  doing amazing and productive stuff with their time and after smoking my  brains out, passed in my car on my lunch break, I told myself enough is  enough. I've been off weed for 50 days and alcohol for 68 days.

Pros/Benefits/Improvements:  
\- Mental clarity  
\- Memeory has significantly improved  
\- I am able to plan and carry through with my plans.  
\- I fall asleep easily  
\- I am more confident and more social  
\- I am able to save and spend my money wisely  
\- I am less impulsive  
\- Eloquent speech and improved vocabulary  
\- Better eating habits  
\- Sugar cravings have subsided  
\- I don't zone out or space out as much as I used to.  
\- I smell and breath better.  
\- I am more honest with people regarding my whereabouts and what I have been up to. I can actually maintain eye contact.  
\- I do not wake up groggy, tired and dehydrated.  
\- Improved work ethic, drive, motivation and ambition.  
\- Improved libido  
\- More energetic and upbeat compared to my smoking days.  


Cons  
\- It's still hard to fall asleep for a solid 6-8 hours  
\-  I can't let go off my weed smoking past, how I've wasted so much time  and potential. This leads to random wave of sadness. Borderline  depression at times.  
\- I still have FOMO, when people talk about weed, when I smell it.  
\- Appetite flactuates  
\-  Random tension headaches  
\- My brain still tries to justify how certain activities would be so much better with weed.

During the past 50 days I've also been slowly working and improving on myself.  
\-  I exercise; lift and run almost every day. I've been able to run 5K,  10K and recently attempted a 21.K. It all started with signing up for  Parkrun and making my Saturday mornings productive   
\- I've also signed up for some official races.  
\-  I've opened a mini savings account and put away on average how much I'd  spend on weed roughly every 3 days. I've wasted a lot of money on weed  and munchies.  
\- I've lost a bit of weight due to my workout routine.  
\-  I actively read, wether it's a novel newspaper articles, productive  subreddits or forums. I push myself, and this has helped with my memory  and concentration.  
\- I've adopted a new hairstyle which people have complimented me on. I had a stoner look going.  
\-  Since I workout alot and I don't smoke or drink anymore, water has  become my best friend. I drink too much so I'm always peeing.  
\- My stamina and energy levels have definitely improved.

  
I  just thought I'd share this with you fellas. It hasn't been easy at  all. There are days where I feel like shit and I just want to smoke and  just chill but I always remind myself that this is my future and I don't  want to look back in a couple of years time and be full of regrets. 

I  want to look back and tell myself I have given everything and worked  hard to become the person I've always wanted to be, and if I fail to  bring out that potential, at least I can honestly say I've tried my damn  best.  
One thing that has  helped me, as well is motivational videos and channels on YouTube, I've  downloaded a few videos and mp3 files that I listen to throw out the  day. I've also looked up and follow some endurance athletes like James  Lawrence, Dave Groggings and Lionel Sanders. I love their desire and  grit to always push on. These guys inspired me to exercise and keep  working out, so far it's been great.  


I  wish you all well brothers and sisters. Keep believing in yourselves,  set small goals, be kind to yourself and with each passing day push  yourself to at least do a single thing that will improve your day.  


Thanks for all your support here. I'll be back again in another 50 days.

I am currently at the 3 day mark of not smoking. I feel the first 24 hours were the worst, but it got easier after that. I had been pretty much tapering off for the prior week, and smoking less than normal for months before that

I had smoked every day, multiple times a day since 2002. I am 31 now, coming up on my 32 birth day in January! So that makes  The weird thing is I still feel pretty much the same (mentally) as I did shortly after graduating high school, which I barely did....

Smoking weed has been such a big part of my life since I started smoking every day. I smoked my first time the summer of 7th grade, so I would have been 13 at the time. I know that sounds young but it is what it is. I was not pressured into it, I chose on my own. This is probably pretty cliche' but ever since the D.A.R.E anti drug program in either 4th, 5th or 6th grade, I had an interest in it. When the police officer who taught the class explained all the risks involved with all the different drugs, weed sounded pretty good, LOL. Non habit forming, one of the cheapest out there, highest percentage of users, and no risk of overdose. I was all like ""I think I want to try that!""

My friend said he had gotten some and I didn't even believe him. At this time, Medical wasn't even a thing... maybe in cali but I don't think so. It was pretty taboo. At least that's what I thought at the time.

I can remember so many milestones (no pun intended). First time buying chronic (as we called it back in the day, the good shit without seeds) First time buying an entire 8th of chronic. First time buying an ounce of regs (regular weed, with seeds). We would also call it ""mersh"", short for commercial. Sometimes called mids when it was really good with seeds. I can remember single nugs that I would hold on to for the longest time.

I absolutely loved it from the first time. It was my go-to conversation starter. It was my only real way to break the ice with girls. I felt I have always had a foot in my mouth around good looking chicks, but when I would talk weed shop with anyone, I felt comfortable. I loved learning about it. I loved the variety that was out there.

I began selling weed in 9th grade. I sold my Magic the Gathering card collection for $150(Still regret that... It would have been so much more valuable if I had just waited....) and bought an ounce of regs for.... I dunno somewhere around 120. Sold eighths for $25. While selling weed I ended up making so many friends, so many great people. And quite a few bad, shitty, really really shitty people.

Day 1: feel like shit, want to vape that night but also don't really feel like it
Day 2: fucking. Amazing.

It feels like my mind and body were going slow-mo and now they're on fast forward to catch up.

But it never lasts. And I think the main culprit is Twitter. I get on, start ranting about shit, then realize I sound like a lunatic. I get anxious, delete Twitter, and end up vaping again to cope with it.

Just some advice for anyone out there who may be struggling, as I still do. Therapy can work wonders. In the past I would quit and start to feel good about myself but as I pointed out above it would be pretty short-lived. 

I approached it a bit different this time. I've started going to therapy alongside quitting weed and the results are outstanding. I'm not even going to post how long it's been since I've smoked because I personally don't feel like it's important to me. 

One of the things being taught in my therapy is compassion, for both myself and those around me. In the past it was the guilt of succumbing to the weed that had me repeat the cycle over and over again. To show myself compassion for things that have happened in the past and cannot be changed. It is what it is and lamenting only harms. 

I don't want to come across like I'm lecturing. I still have shakey days but the difference is I am welcoming them as a part of life. Can't remember where I saw it but there is a quote to the tune of ""the goal of life isn't to arrive at the gates of heaven slowly and peacefully, it's to come skidding in sideways all beaten up saying, man, what a ride""

Just a helpful tip to anyone out there who feels they are caught in a cycle and thinks they might need to change things up, therapy might not be a bad idea. Abstinence alongside maybe figuring out the reasons why you smoke  on a deep level could be the change that gives you the peace you seek.

I quit smoking on November 15th, 2019. The first few days of withdrawls were awful. Aside from feeling physically ill I also experienced overwhelming amounts of dread at what the future held, and grief for all the years I wasted smoking. But those days passed and I found myself overwhelming optimistic for my newfound freedom.

No longer was I sneaking into the bathroom at my partner's house to hit my pen. My bank account flourished in ways I hadn't seen in years. Two weeks after quitting I started a medical coding program in an attempt to build a new foundation for my future. I moved back in with my parents and cut my hours at work to focus on the class. Finding my groove was difficult as I hadn't been in a learning environment in almost ten years, but I found having something to hold myself accountable to was a nice change of pace. 

Now, a couple weeks later, I'm back to being overwhelmed and perpetually stressed. The program is difficult, I knew it wouldn't be easy but I didn't anticipate it taking me an hour and a half, sometimes more, to get through a page. I went from having nothing I HAD to do, to knowing there's something I could be doing all the time. I go out with friends to blow off steam, enjoying myself while I'm there, then come home and reality starts to wash over me like a dark fog. I get mad at myself for wasting hours out when I could've spent that time making progress in my program. 

And man, I'm fucking tired. After the initial period of sleepless nights I found myself sleeping like a baby. But the last week or so the night sweats are back, I turn of my lamp, turn on the fan, and settle into my bed, and feel like I could run a marathon shortly after. I toss and I turn, I have dreams that I hate, I worry about things out of my control, question all the choices I've made for the last decade. My job, though I'm only there 20 hours a week anymore, is exhausting. I spend all my time doing everything for everyone else, and come home and have to do those same things for myself. On top of everything I'm trying to salvage what free time I do have by doing things I enjoy (spending time with my partners/friends, going to the gym, lounging with my dog), but even these things are starting to feel like chores. Most friday nights/saturday morning I go to my partners house and spend the weekend with them. Don't get me wrong, I love them, they're amazingly supportive, and they take some of the burden off the menial tasks of adulthood, but packing and unpacking my suitcase every weekend is exhausting. After a day or two the anxiety about all the things I could accomplish in my own home start creeping in and I feel antsy to leave. The kicker? When I do a couple days later and am lying in my bed alone I desperately want to be in their bed with them. 

All this stress, and change, has me missing weed so fucking much. Part of the reason I quit in the first place was because smoking only exacerbated my anxiety, and with every hit I'd feel worse and worse. But before it had that effect it melted reality away and I was able to relax. I miss being able to relax. I lay in bed at night tossing and turning, knowing that a couple puffs would rectify the situation.

I successfully quit two years ago for about four months, and didn't have a single craving during that time, so I'm completely unsure with how to cope with these feelings. Logically I know smoking again would be detrimental not only to my success in my class, but most likely to my entire future. But the loud, overbearing emotional part of me wants to not care because I know it would feel so good, albeit only for a brief moment.

So that's where I'm at today fellow leavers. I know I'm not going to give in to temptation, but I can't stop thinking about what a sweet release it would be.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9952854514122009}"

Thanks everyone for your help! In the end I don't know if this was THC-related, there is still THC in my system so who knows, it's a weird beast. But if there is gonna be episodes like this I'm probably gonna quit it altogether.

(WARNING BEFORE READING THIS IF YOU ARE IN RECOVERY FROM WEED: this post will describe toking in detail, only to help people get a grasp on my current situation, please do not read if you feel as if such a thing will enable a desire to take it again.)

Hello! I didn't really know where to ask this but I thought maybe you guys could help me. I'm a 30 yr old woman and have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, pcos, (not in danger of diabetes currently) and depression. Currently I am not taking medication due to not having medical insurance until January, I just take Vitamin D and fish oil supplements, sometimes melatonin.

Around August of this year I decided to start experimenting with weed to see if it would help my anxiety. I started with a strain that was recommended for beginners, and rolled joints with it, the highs and aftermaths were pleasant every time. Around mid-September I switched to a strain with an extremely high dose of THC, 30% or so with 3% CBD. (I thought it would be ok if I still only puffed very little of it from a thin joint) The first two times I smoked it I was alright, the next time I had my first bad high in which I had several panic attacks. I waited a while after this to toke again, nothing really bad happened during this ""withdrawal"" period except some mild lightheadedness for a few days, and I started again with the same strain around mid-October or so. After that I had some decent highs, though not great. I usually smoke maybe once a week, though I often switched it up to once every two weeks, and re-use joints because I feel like more than one puff already gets me too high.

So this brings us to today. On Monday last week (12-2-19) I was menstruating with some incredibly bad cramps, so I puffed once from what was already the end of a joint of this same strong strain I've been having, and it was around a week after I smoked the same way last. The high was normal and not too strong, mostly pleasant. The next three days I had just some mild lightheadedness, but nothing too bad.

However, on Thursday evening, after I exercised, the lightheadedness was particularly bothersome. I didn't think too much on it and went to sleep. But the lightheadedness got worse Friday and onwards, and I started to get nausea, regurgitation, (no actual vomiting and even if I try to incite it it doesn't easily come out) stomach and ""toilet"" problems, incredibly decreased appetite, and panic attacks for three days straight where I had trouble breathing.

Because of the fact that I won't have medical insurance until January I can't really see a doctor right now without it costing me a firstborn child. I called a nurse hotline twice and described the symptoms and they said both times that it ""sounds like anxiety."" My blood sugar is fine, my blood pressure is fine, my heartrate is fine.

It is Wednesday now, more than a week after I toked last, and I'm still getting lightheadedness, though I can breathe easier. I feel like it's eased up a little when I sit (I work at the computer) however it still gets pretty bad when I'm standing, such as to do chores. I feel like exercise helps, but every time I do so I get incredibly lightheaded and paranoid afterwards, with some depersonalization (almost as if I'm slightly high) and stomach pain. I get dry mouth sometimes, though I don't seem to be dehydrated. Yesterday evening after exercising and a shower, right before bed, I had such a bad headache that I had to take some ibuprofen. It doesn't seem to be coming back at least.

So my question to you all is: Am I experiencing withdrawal or could something else be at play considering I only just started smoking recently? Please, any advice would help!

Two things to mention: 1) I've experienced anxiety and panic before without weed, but I'm usually able to pinpoint the trigger and my thoughts race. The anxiety and panic I'm currently facing doesn't seem to have a trigger and I can't pinpoint my thoughts, no good thoughts OR bad thoughts. At most what I'll think is ""what if I got [disease/illness] and I'm dying?"" 2) I haven't really had any urge to smoke again, only briefly considered doing so to help the symptoms. But when I think about it making the symptoms worse I don't consider it again.

I'm a little worried that I only quit because I'm going on a honeymoon on a cruise and there will be no drugs in sight for a long while...On the bright side wedding nerves and withdrawal seems indistinguishable to most around me. I'm apprehensive about my thoughts ""who sober me will be, how will I cope with life at all?"" Which only reinforces my need to quit. I am greatful that there are people on here (Reddit), who don't buy into the whole ""weed is harmless"" school of thought because where I live is trying to legalize and a large number of my friends don't even think that my quitting makes sense. Its nice to not be completely alone. Thank you r/leaves.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7480843663215637}"

Even though I still can’t help think about their the day at times,  the big change is that I find it easier to deal with my thoughts rationally.

I'm entering day 8 now, and it's a conflicting experience. I've found that when i'm working and doing things in the day I can put it out of my mind, and whilst the evenings were horrible at first, even that's getting a bit better. My sleep is weird, I have vivid dreams, and wake up every hour or two once i've gotten to sleep, but i'm hoping that this does subside in the long run.

My biggest struggle is the regret I'm feeling. I can rationalise it with all the 'you can't change your past' things, but that doesn't stop the horrible pangs that come from just realising what i lost through it....who I lost. So here's an open letter to the best person I ever lost get it out of my system:

&#x200B;

Dear X

I'm so so sorry for what I did and how I treated you. It kills me everyday to some degree and I don't know if i'll ever be fully free of it. 

When you came into my life, I thought I was looking for a degree of affection, maybe even love. I didn't accept that I was already in a relationship with smoking, and though somehow you still cared for me through this I know I wasn't able to give you the best parts of me. Instead you got the worst.  


I remember you treated me better than anyone had, and better than I deserved. I also remember getting irritated and frustrated and blaming you when really it was because i wanted to go home and get high. I remember the good times, laughing, cuddling, helping you push your fucking motorbike up a vertical hill for god's sake.  In fact now that a lot of the high has gone, I remember so much in sharp focus and it hurts more than anything, because I can't blame anyone but myself.

I've spent my whole life watching other people have the kind of close connections i've wanted so badly, and tbh I don't even know if i'm capable of it or deserve it. Knowing I had it and did what I did is something I might never get over or forgive myself for. It hurts me but I'm glad you left and found a life and a guy that makes you happy because you deserve that. Maybe in another life it could have been me....

I make myself feel better by thinking that in some other version of the multiverse, maybe I made better choices, and maybe we're still together. I'm clean  and we spend our time doing what we did, only I'm able to show you the best of me, in a world where i can sleep next to you fully content, not just anxious because i can't get high to get me to sleep.

I know I'll never get another shot, and that's only fair. Whereas from my perspective I can see just how much of my behavior was driven by the drugs and I know how much better It would be if we ever had another shot, i'm also fully aware that from your perspective there's no way for you to know that, and it's unreasonable of me to ask that of you or anyone else. I guess my biggest fear is that you'll never know and remember me as a shitty boyfriend.

I don't know what the future has for me. I'm 28 and feel like i'm the epitome of damaged goods. My dating pool is small enough as it is and it took me 26 years to find you. I still can't believe I threw that away. I had the briefest time in my life where I didn't have to do everything alone, and if i'm being honest, I really don't think i'm strong enough to do all this life crap by myself much longer. I've watched my friends pair up, and/or have the kind of family I'd kill for, and I guess i'm a bit jealous yeah, but moreover I just wish people would appreciate having a pillar of support. It's damn tough without one.

Anyway, I don't know where I go from here, but I want you to know that whilst it was too late, i've quit the bud. I'm becoming me again for better or worse, and if I hadn't had you and felt pain of losing you then i'd probably never have stopped. You'll never know this but at least it makes me believe my feelings were real, and so I'm thankful for having known you and hope life gives you everything that you ever dreamed of.

As for myself, I  don't know. I really hope life gives me another shot but I don't think it will. But I promise you that if it does, and if it turns out that the universe decides I'm worth a second chance and I meet someone I can care for as much as you, then I promise, I absolutely promise that I will love that person fully, treat them how they deserve and never EVER let it be lost on me or slip away just for the sake of a fucking smoke. I have to use this to be better in future, otherwise I lost you for nothing.

Again I wish you nothing but the best from life, and know i'll miss you for a long time.

Yours

I thought it would be just like alcohol. But it wasn't. It was so, so different. In fact, it might have been the most 'different' thing I'd ever experienced. It made me anxious and act like an idiot, but it also took me away from my life completely. I lost myself.

I don't know why, but I immediately had this intense anxiety about the whole thing yet felt compelled to smoke again. It made me feel like I was in a dream and everything felt, sounded, and tasted amazing.

Hello! I didn't really know where to ask this but I thought maybe you guys could help me. I'm a 30 yr old woman and have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, pcos, (not in danger of diabetes currently) and depression. Currently I am not taking medication due to not having medical insurance until January, I just take Vitamin D and fish oil supplements, sometimes melatonin.

Around August of this year I decided to start experimenting with weed to see if it would help my anxiety. I started with a strain that was recommended for beginners, and rolled joints with it, the highs and aftermaths were pleasant every time. Around mid-September I switched to a strain with an extremely high dose of THC, 30% or so with 3% CBD. (I thought it would be ok if I still only puffed very little of it from a thin joint) The first two times I smoked it I was alright, the next time I had my first bad high in which I had several panic attacks. I waited a while after this to toke again, nothing really bad happened during this ""withdrawal"" period except some mild lightheadedness for a few days, and I started again with the same strain around mid-October or so. After that I had some decent highs, though not great. I usually smoke maybe once a week, though I often switched it up to once every two weeks, and re-use joints because I feel like more than one puff already gets me too high.

So this brings us to today. On Monday last week (12-2-19) I was menstruating with some incredibly bad cramps, so I puffed once from what was already the end of a joint of this same strong strain I've been having, and it was around a week after I smoked the same way last. The high was normal and not too strong, mostly pleasant. The next three days I had just some mild lightheadedness, but nothing too bad. 

However, on Thursday evening, after I exercised, the lightheadedness was particularly bothersome. I didn't think too much on it and went to sleep. But the lightheadedness got worse Friday and onwards, and I started to get nausea, regurgitation, (no actual vomiting and even if I try to incite it it doesn't easily come out) stomach and ""toilet"" problems, incredibly decreased appetite, and panic attacks for three days straight where I had trouble breathing. 

Because of the fact that I won't have medical insurance until January I can't really see a doctor right now without it costing me a firstborn child. I called a nurse hotline twice and described the symptoms and they said both times that it ""sounds like anxiety."" My blood sugar is fine, my blood pressure is fine, my heartrate is fine. 

It is Wednesday now, more than a week after I toked last, and I'm still getting lightheadedness, though I can breathe easier. I feel like it's eased up a little when I sit (I work at the computer) however it still gets pretty bad when I'm standing, such as to do chores. I feel like exercise helps, but every time I do so I get incredibly lightheaded and paranoid afterwards, with some depersonalization (almost as if I'm slightly high) and stomach pain. I get dry mouth sometimes, though I don't seem to be dehydrated. Yesterday evening after exercising and a shower, right before bed, I had such a bad headache that I had to take some ibuprofen. It doesn't seem to be coming back at least.

So my question to you all is: Am I experiencing withdrawal or could something else be at play considering I only just started smoking recently? Please, any advice would help!

Two things to mention:
1) I've experienced anxiety and panic before without weed, but I'm usually able to pinpoint the trigger and my thoughts race. The anxiety and panic I'm currently facing doesn't seem to have a trigger and I can't pinpoint my thoughts, no good thoughts OR bad thoughts. At most what I'll think is ""what if I got [disease/illness] and I'm dying?""
2) I haven't really had any urge to smoke again, only briefly considered doing so to help the symptoms. But when I think about it making the symptoms worse I don't consider it again.

One thing she said that really struck me is that if you want to move on, you have to thank the planet. Until you acknowledge it as an intelligence or being which has assisted you in some shape or form throughout life, you will be stuck. In order to move on, you have to let go, and in order to let go you need to acknowledge all the good the plant has done for you.

The reason I’m writing this is because I see a lot of posts on this subreddit where people demonize marijuana and frame it as the source of their problems, or that it ruined their life, or some other negative thing. Although this may be true to a certain extent, it also did a lot of good for you at some point in your life which is why you chose to continue using it.

Cannabis is neither good nor bad until you make it so. Objectively speaking, cannabis is good because of its healing properties and other practical uses, whether it be medicinal or not. The problem is when you start to abuse the plant and use it selfishly.

I quit for about 4 years when I decided to be a Jehovahs Witness (sometimes I think my desire to smoke may have been one of the main things that helped me find my way out of there). I spent that time in my life using alcohol instead. It caused a lot of problems for me. I'm not a habitual drinker but a binge drinker to a dangerous extreme. Once I finally realized I had the alcohol problem, I used it as an excuse to smoke. ""It keeps me from drinking,"" I would say. ""You know what happens when I drink. You don't want that, right?""

But I became dependent on weed. I've been buying almost an ounce every four weeks (rookie numbers, I know). Bong rips at 6am before breakfast, bowls and joints all day at work, can't sleep without multiple bong rips at night... You know the deal. ""It helps with my anxiety. It works better than my Prozac. I need it to sleep. I'm just so bored without it.""

I'd get up at 6am to have breakfast with my husband. Instead of using the next couple hours before work for something good, I'd just get high and lay around. I'd smoke all day at work and dread any time I had to actually do anything (which doesn't quite work out when you work on commission). I was never in the mood for conversation. I was too lazy to make love to my husband. I couldn't even make it through an episode on Netflix with him without going into a weed coma after 20 minutes. I've gone from 130lbs to 174lbs in the last 18 months. 

I finally realized I had a problem with addiction in general when the last few times I've ran out without immediate access to a re-up, I've gotten blackout drunk instead. I almost died in September from wrapping my car around a tree. I had about 30 pills in my mouth last week when my husband had to practically shove his hand down my throat to get them out so I wouldn't kill myself. I've physically harmed him in a rage multiple times now. 

Yet he's still here. My life is still here. I can still write my story. At 27, after 11 years of various substance abuses, I'm finally going completely clean.

That didn’t happen, it has now been 6 months, and I’m now at an all time high of smoking 50g a month.

I started vaping bud in late 2017 and was soon doing so every night.

I’m currently trying to quit, but I’m getting a lot of different problems and wondered if anyone has had similar.

I have insomnia, vivid dreams, nerve pain all over my body, numb hands and arms at night, chest and abdominal pain, ringing in my ears, breathlessness, pain when I need to pee, sharp pains in my ears, back and neck joint pain.

FYI I was diagnosed with IBS in March 2019, which could explain the chest and abdominal pain, but not a lot of the other stuff. And a lot of these symptoms are relatively new, which falls in line with me quitting weed.

What I can’t figure out is whether I’ve been misdiagnosed with IBS (slightly suspect fibromyalgia) or whether a lot of this is a result of weed withdrawal. 

Or maybe the weed was just masking a lot of my symptoms before, and now I’ve stopped I’m feeling it all.

Basically I have absolutely no clue what’s going on with my body and literally any insight whatsoever would be helpful, would be good to hear if anyone has had any of my less common symptoms.

This is like my 100th day one...

I'm 23 and I started smoking weed with 17. Very occasionally. More often with 19, like 2-3 times a week. Since I'm 21 it's basically been daily use, mostly in the evenings. 

I feel like I can't trust myself.
It's like a lot of other people on here state as well:
I know it's doing me a lot of harm. I'm being way more anxious and introverted for one.

But even though I know that it harms me and while I make good intentions to quit nearly every day, especially after I smoked and my high comes down and I feel like garbage: I just seem to forget about all of that when 17/18:00 comes around and I buy weed or pre-rolls and start smoking.

Quite honestly : I feel like I am going insane.
I'm not seeing or hearing things. I can act quite normal when in University.

But if I really want to do something, like quitting, how is it that I simply can't do as I wish and will my mind/body to do.
It's like I'm out of control.
At least that's how it feels like for me at the moment.

Guess the answer to that would be: I am addicted.

But just knowing what's wrong never fixed the issue itself. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough? What am I missing?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984939098358154}"

The reason I’m really trying to stop smoking is because I already have slight binge eating disorder which worsens when I smoke. Since I tend to smoke at night, I get so hungry that I end up ordering massive amounts of food and overeating. When I’m high it’s like I don’t have a care in the world for what I’m eating and don’t fear the weight gain but as soon as I wake up the next day I feel guilty and disgusting. 

I am prescribed vyvanse because I have ADHD and binge eating disorder but it doesn’t really seem to be working for the binge eating because the stimulant has usually worn off by the time I start smoking. So naturally because I’m eating less during the day because of the vyvanse, as soon as it wears off combined with munchies from smoking calls for a disaster of overeating and eating anything I can get my hands on.

The school I go to doesn’t have any therapists around me that are covered by my insurance so I can’t get professional help. I’m lost and feel like i have become dependent on smoking. Every day I try to tell myself today will be different it ends the same: smoking and then eating too much. It’s like a vicious cycle that I can’t put an end to. I’ve gained a lot of weight, I used to be 130 lbs female 5’4 but now I’m over 150 lbs which for me having always been smaller is causing major self acceptance and confidence problems.

Stick around here for my story. It may interest you (great!), it might not (also fine, of course) but I thought I’d share it just in case it can help even one person. That would honestly be amazing if I could as I know first hand how lonely withdrawl, sobriety and returning to who you once were can really be. 

I last posted/ checked this subreddit when I was on day 10 or so and I was really, really struggling. I was worried about how I was, if what I was going through was normal and if I would ever return to my former self. I was struggling with self doubt, confidence, performing basic tasks like talking, recognising objects, recalling memories from times gone by (haha, I’d struggle with seeing ones from the future but I’ll leave that in now I’ve noticed how dumb that statement is) and even talking or writing. Whether that was to loved ones, new people, socialising or even forming basic sentences- both textually and verbally. 

I’ve taken 40 days off basically to think. I’m lucky in that the situation I’m in gave me the opportunity to simply give myself... time. I realise that- unfortunately- this isn’t an option for everyone but, in my experience, I would recommend everyone takes as much time as they can to REALLY think about who they are, what they want, who they were, who they want to be, where they are etc. etc. As you can see from that asyndetic list, I have done a lot of thinking over the last 6 or 7 weeks or so. Facing my problems instead of avoiding them has paid dividends. Although that sounds platitudinal, it’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. I understand any empathise with anyone in this situation and I realise how easy it is to fall into the trap of conscience- then, inevitably, unconscious- avoidance. You’re not weak for this, friends. You’re human. 

Now, instead of smoking, I think. Instead of smoking a joint when I feel down, I exercise or cook a meal I REALLY enjoy instead. This has proved greatly beneficial as I feel (and am) healthier and look better, also. Both physically and in terms of my general temperament (or ‘aura’, if you will). I now pass more vibe checks than I fail, you could say. I now have goals, ambitions, dreams and plans for the rest of my life that don’t revolve around doing nothing but wallowing in my own self pity and lighting up every day to encourage that same, sad cycle of self-depreciation. Sure, the world CAN suck... but that doesn’t mean we should hinder/ hurt ourselves because of it. The biggest realisation I’ve had is: we all need to give ourself a chance. Every. Single. One. Of. Us. Is. Worth. It... and that includes me... and that includes you. 

Keep going, brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters. Here’s what gets better:

-Self Confidence
-Memories Return 
-Depressive/ Anxious Moods fade. If these persist after more than 60 days after sobriety (I am no expert, of course) I would recommend consulting a health professional. The ones caused by THC withdrawal fade when the body has/ has mostly detoxed itself of the chemical. In my experience, that is. 
- Ability to learn returns... you WILL remember things first time, you WILL understand exactly what’s going on in films/ television and you WILL be able to take part in conversations once more just like you always did. I would go on, but there’s so much that comes back... including that one thing you’re most worried about right now. My advice for if you’re anxious about anything is: Be positive. Give it time. It gets better.
- You laugh at things, appreciate the small things (like streams, food, a good night’s sleep, your friends... anything, really) and see the good  the world has to offer. 
- Communication skills that you may THINK are permanently diminished are not. Your vocabulary returns to where it once was (you may need to look up a definition to a word you think you once knew every now and again but- as stated above- you can now learn things again so, in sports parlance, “no harm; no foul”) and you can structure complicated sentences- verbally and textually- once more. 

The list goes on... and on... and on... and on. My point there is- as stated above... BE POSITIVE and BE PATIENT and ANYTHING you’re going through WILL diminish. Feel free to ask me anything or raise any queries on this post (or drop me a private message if you’re not comfortable with that- I’ll get back to you as soon as I can if you choose to:) ) and I hope this post has been useful. Took me about 15 mins to write so it best have been;)) 50 days ago, though... I couldn’t even ask my mum a question or formulate a basic text message. Take from that what you will. 

You got this, guys. Each and every one of you. Stay positive, big love... good luck. 

We can come back from anything in life; we just need to put the work in and believe. Know that, friends. It DOES get BETTER

It's only now on (God please) Day 2 of my final quit that I can see how it blinds people who stay in control or don't abuse other drugs. Because it is so harmless in the short-term, and because even if you abuse it daily it's the only drug you can still function that makes psychological addiction with weed easier than ANY other drug. I'm not saying that had I armed myself with this realization before college I would never have tried weed, but I NEVER would have become a pothead because I always treated other drugs as dangerous to abuse but NEVER pot. I once believed alcohol was fairly harmless too, but quickly abandoned that because alcohol, unlike cannabis, swiftly punishes people who use it excessively with horrible side effects.

&#x200B;

Cannabis's deleterious side effects were nonexistent in my first year smoking it because I was a strict Weekend Warrior. Even in the next eight years as a pothead, the ugly side effects only revealed themselves to me from 2016 to the present because only then I got to smoke as much weed as I wanted. Because the other times I was in rehab or sober livings and didn't smoke any weed due to not knowing how at the time to cheat the tests. So I never got to smoke enough pot to learn of its side effects when you abuse it daily to semi-daily for too long. So I never thought it had any detrimental side effects. Boy was I wrong because in 2016 to present was when I learned about the brain fog, the effects of short-term memory and motivation once you cross that line and become a burnout. It truly sucks, the side effects of weed abuse are worse than any other drug because of how long they linger in your body and brain. It may take years for me to undo the damage I've done to myself and I won't complain because it was a self-inflicted wound years in the making. Other drugs punish you when you exceed your limits right away, pot never does. THAT'S THE DANGER!!!",26,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9933690428733826}"

Exactly a week ago I decided that it's time for me to take a break or stop with weed all together.  
After every weekend, often also on weekdays, I feel so incredibly dizzy when I wake up in the morning because I smoked so much weed during the days before.

It takes me many hours, usually until lunch, until I really sober up from all the smoking. During this ""hangover"" I feel so muddled, confused and just not how I want to feel when I go to work. Just like after smoking I also have a very hard time concentrating, I'm uninterested and I try to keep interactions with other people to a minimum.

What I however hate the most is the fact, that I can do nothing to change this state except wait and sober up. Well, there would be this one thing: not smoke anything in the first place!

So I decided to do exactly that. I knew that it would be tough and that for the first few days I'd probably just lay in bed and do nothing because the cravings would impair me so much. And that's what happened, but I was able to resist until Friday. I did however already feel so much of a difference in my mental abilities. No longer I had some sort of ""reset"" every day, from which I first need to sober up and recover. Suddenly I felt more awake, more concentrated, more motivated and more powerful with each day I didn't smoke!

But Friday appeared and like the days before I was playing League of Legends with my friends. We lost a few games, I was a bit stressed about it, and without much thinking I just loaded my vaporizer and took a hit. And here we go, I smoked again all weekend long! I have to say that I really felt bad about it, especially yesterday, after I said to myself I wouldn't smoke on Monday, but I just could not resist.

So today, I'm again in the exact same seat as last week. I feel very dizzy and I hate it, I'm deciding that I won't smoke anymore and I feel motivated to make this change. But how do I prevent myself to also fall back into the same behavior again and smoke, just because the cravings are making me a bit uncomfortable in situations where I'd like to relax instead?

What also doesn't help is the fact that I'm kind of addicted to League of Legends as well right now and it goes hand in hand with the weed consumption. I first thought that'd I'd also be able to enjoy the game without weed, but I think it just greatly endangers me to fall back into the same routine where I smoke and play, just because I've been doing it for a while now.

Does anyone have experience with a similar situation and some advice for me?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976069927215576}"

I know I should put my life in track and it's one of the reasons why I decided to stop. this and because the lack of money, I spend so much and it's not even my money, it's what I received from my parents which makes me feel so guilty for spending with drugs. my mom already knows, she smokes cigarettes which was how I first started smoking, so she doesn't really talks to me about it and I feel that is because she thinks she doesn't have the right to speak about this subject, which I think it's ridiculous, but I'm grateful because I would just cry thought the hole conversation and feel even more disappointed with myself. anyways, it's five am in Brazil and I'm about to go to sleep, I don't think I will be able to but...

I would ask to myself why I thought smoking again was a good idea but I never did. 
I was knowing full well that I will get instantly hooked after a single puff, but proceeded to ask for three puffs because I’m over my addiction and what could three puffs even do to me? I’ll tell ya


After seven months of weed free time, I picked up smoking again 6 months ago and in a short amount of time I lost both of my jobs, generated around 1000€ of debt, became an uncreative, anxious, goal-less, self-hating piece of shit who can’t put his mind on anything other than sleeping the whole day and doing nothing but score and smoke with friends. Even if I’m trying hard to works against these feelings it doesn’t work well. Even my 3-HO-PCP binges and benzodiazepine experiences did less damage than weed to me, seems absurd but it’s true

My willpower and ability to think clearly is absolutely fucked by weed. Also it makes me slightly depressed which I only noticed  after the first longer break when the feeling subsided after a month or two. Before that I thought everyone feels like this and I’m just exaggerating. At first I could fight the unproductiveness by just smoking in the evening, worked at first but daily smoking is never successful in the long run as you can see.

It felt like I learned so much about my addiction, got up easier in the mornings, actually having goals and going after them,  being more fluent verbally, putting on around 5-7kg of weight which has always been hard for me and the list goes on and on. 

Felt like I was meeting my real self for the first time. This all feels like a giant throwback but I have to remember that beating addiction is a long drawn process and can’t be done overnight. Kinda like 2 steps forward, 1 backwards.

This time, I am cutting alcohol as well, so that’s 2 weeks without both weed and alcohol. I never really had a problem with alcohol in terms of moderation, not even remotely comparable to my issues with weed, I just decided to do it as a personal challenge, and also to enhance my weight-loss efforts. Feeling pretty damn good without booze (I know, surprise surprise!).

Anyway there’s the obligatory background info. I’ve been hard on myself about my relapse and throwing 6 weeks away only to go on a bender and prove to myself again why I need to quit. I’m also going through a breakup with girlfriend of several years, for reasons unrelated to my substance abuse. You’d think that would make me want to numb my emotions, right? Well maybe old me would have welcomed weed and booze to numb the pain, but I got tired of being numb to life a while ago. I’m welcoming this pain with open arms, I’m going to make it a part of me and learn from it. I think that’s the only way to move forward and keep improving yourself and your life.

I was taking a walk tonight and I thought about how hard it is for me to forgive myself for past mistakes. I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to let go of the memories of how many good opportunities I’ve squandered, both in my career and personal life.  Thinking about the past really gets me down, but then I realized that maybe I don’t have to forgive myself at all, maybe that’s the wrong focus. What does it really mean to forgive yourself? Does it mean that you’re suddenly okay with the choices you’ve made? Does it mean you accept your current place in life and stop dwelling on past mistakes? I think trying to forgive yourself for past mistakes is a trap, because ultimately you’re still negatively thinking about yourself. You’re still focused on what you did wrong.

Instead, think about this. When is the last time you focused on something you did right? Even if it’s something simple. Thank yourself for working out today. Thank yourself for eating right all day. Thank yourself for cleaning your house. Just try it, say the words out loud. I thanked myself for being strong enough to restart my recovery and for staying sober even through everything I’m currently dealing with. I thanked myself for having the motivation to go on a walk tonight. For the first time in a long time, I felt gratitude for myself, just for being who I am and making the good choices that I’m making.

Physique: 190lbs, 6’1”


Today is day 24 of abstinence.  I haven’t felt a “dry high” in a couple of days, which coincides with the onset of my headaches. Yesterday my headache began late in the evening, and today it has been a constant dull ache since around 1300.  Another curious coincidence, I tested myself on day 21, which showed a positive result for THC (urine stick hometest). I tested myself today and saw a faint line, which seems to indicate that there are less THC metabolites in my urine.

My hypothesis is that these headaches are increasing in their severity as my body is releasing less THC stored in my fat cells. I’ve also noticed increased sweating during the headache period.

I’m not worried about passing a drug test anytime soon, nor am I looking for any advice on that (there are other communities for that). This is unlike anything else in life I’ve dealt with, and I’m just wondering how long until my body acclimates to its THC free environment. I passed the insomnia and nightsweats stage within the first week (benedryl got me through mortars in Afghan, it handled withdrawal like a champ). I also stick with the old “Motrin and water” routine for any other aches and pains and it works out fine, just not the headaches. They feel an awful lot like caffeine withdrawal headaches - if I skip drinking Rockstar for 2 days, on the third I’ll have a dull pain headache all day.

I’m 18 now and struggling to quit.","At first, smoking really helped me become a deeper, more critical thinker, and a more calm person. Before I knew what weed was, I was a very hyper, angry, impulsive, and inconsiderate kid. I’m very thankful for the wonders that cannabis has brought me, but over the few years I’ve been smoking, It’s become impossible to ignore the negative affects my excessive THC abuse has had on me. I don’t think cannabis is a bad substance at all, but I believe it’s a sacred herb that should only be taken occasionally. Since about the beginning of 2018, I noticed my tolerance to THC was becoming very high and I required more weed to even feel buzzed. Now I’m at the point that I hate being “normal” (sober) and being high is my comfortable state, but at the same time when I’m high, I just feel drowsy, and unable to think straight, but only feeling a LITTLE buzzed. And the worst part is, I’m spending about $50 a week on dab carts to feel this mild buzz and discomfort. Yet I can’t stop. I know marijuana isn’t addictive, but you can become dependent on anything if you do it too much. I’ve become very depressed and unable to enjoy most of my life when I’m not high and sometimes even when I am high. I feel like I’ve burnt out and clogged all my dopamine receptors to the point that I always feel so numb and indifferent, but craving THC. My brain can’t comprehend or process information NEARLY as efficiently or quickly as it used to be able to. I BARELY graduated high school, and I’m stuck working a minimum wage job with no car. I have no motivation to do anything with my life, I’m just sitting back and watching myself fail worse and worse as I go on. I’ve been trying to cut back a lot but it’s so difficult. I always use “I’m really bored” as an excuse for smoking/vaping all the time, and I think it’s because I can’t feel excitement or entertainment from most things anymore except when smoking. I usually hit my pen twice in the morning, twice before work, and 2-4 times when I get home from work, but recently I’m trying to just hit it a couple times after coming home from work at night, and I was successful for almost a week, but today I gave in and brought the pen to work and hit it before, causing me to be insanely slow and feel very stupid. I try to distract myself on my days off by hanging out with friends and playing music with my band but it’s just so hard. I don’t know if it’s because I do it so much, or because I started from such a young age or what, but I wish I never became a “pothead”.  It’s also v hard bc everybody in my life basically smokes weed (even though it’s not as much as me), and it makes me childishly feel like I’m missing out.

We all know hacking our mind essentially and changing our ways of thinking is a huge part of quitting. What I need -  no wait, see there I go again - what I WANT is to change ""I have to"" or ""I need to"" to ""I want to"". This applies to anything. The thing we all have trouble with, whatever bad habit it is, we feel like we have to, that we're forced to, and obviously we don't want to do anything we dont truly want to do. It's tricky because we can't just lie to ourselves and tell ourselves we want to do something that we don't. However, when we start to notice this.. and WANT to change our thinking from have to to want to, we can think more about the task at hand and think about reasons you actually do want to do said task.

Here are my examples:
I want to go to work and earn money.
I want to grocery shop.
I want to do yoga.
I want to run. I want to bike. 
I want to work out and get strong.
I want to learn.
I want to cook.
I want to get organized.
I want to be clean (no maryjane).

These are all obviously things that I avoid doing as I feel like I dont want to do them. Then why are they constantly on my mind? Yes, one of the reasons is because I want to be able to stop thinking about them, which means to quit procrastinating or avoiding and just freakin do it. But otherwise, they're still all on my to-list for good reasons, usually because I desire the outcome that completing the task will bring. Of course the other trick is staying in the moment and being mindful through the process/typically boring parts, but that's a topic for another time lol.

So really, we do want to do those things. It's usually the energy involved that keeps us in avoidance mode. And ironically we don't have the energy because maryjane stole it from us and we also have adopted even more unhealthy habits, making our energy either low or totally out of balance with you mind/body. Also fear of bad feelings why you do said task. But if you can ask yourself why you don't want to do said thing, you can get to the root of it and then work to overcome it. Most people don't, of course, and just stay miserable. But if you don't want to stay so miserable, a large part of that is being able to fully positively accept the state of ""what is"" in your reality and in every moment. And if you can't, you can ask yourself why not, and if there could be ways for you to think differently about something, in a positive light vs.  a negative one.

Of course, with weed/drug addition it can be ever harder as our brain chemistry will not allow us to think positively at times as it adjusts and heals. It sucks. But knowing that it's a temporary chemistry thing and that this isn't just how you feel when sober, is the thing to remember. Those negative thoughts aren't real.  You could think positively when you're high more often than not, right? That helps prove that youre capable of it, you just have to establish the right, balanced brain chemistry to get there (includes other healthy habits) and changing your mindset and ways of thinking to thoughts that serve you better and don't make you miserable.

You could put me in a room with free weed and cocaine and it wouldn't have bothered me and i could have said no with ease. I had stoner friends all my life from 17 and still do, I could sit whilst they smoke and happily just watch and do whatever stupid activity they were doing. I was the 'boring' friend.

My life has always been plagued with 'addiction'. At 18 i found gambling i turned £5 into £50 playing machine roulette and thought i had a system, i was just another mug destined to give my money away. 9 years later i finally managed to quit alone with no help and for the previous 9/10 years put on a brave face on the outside despite losing what i now total around £ 300,000-£350,000 GBP. Fortunately or unfortunately i had and still do have a very good job.

During my gambling epidemic I met a girl. Looking back i realize she should have been an ex after 6 months, but none the less being a guy and she being an attractive brunette it went on longer. To her i was rich, had a good family, good job, nice car I didn't have problems, if i had problems they weren't real problems. I tried opening up about my issues i got laughed at, so naturally i never shared anything. You can probably see what type of girl she was by just a few lines. Selfish, self-centered yes, yes.

Summer time and i'm 27 years old. My above relationship has deteriorated, its break up every week, its toxic and like weed and gambling very hard to let go without saying 'just one more time'. The breakups effected me, sleeping was an issue. (we all know where this is going). I'm at my stoner friends talking about my relationship and he offers be a toke on his joint. That toke led to me being able to just relax, forget about my ex and all my problems and just chill. 

At first it was fun, i was always round my mates smoking, playing computer games, watching TV, walking the dogs having stoned cooking competitions eating chips (fries) and believing they tasted exactly like Mcdonalds ones. 

Eventually you skip smoking with friends and  smoke on your own and that's a slippery slope. You don't realize you have a problem at first,  when i couldn't get weed i was irritable, couldn't sleep and basically catting out a bit. 

In December 2018 was when when i realized i had an issue. My head was a fogged up mess. Socializing became an inconvenience and i was on auto pilot.  Wake up - Work - Smoke - Eat - Sleep. That was effectively me, i had stopped going to my friends, that was too much effort now. 

Christmas i tried quitting, i was staying at my parents over the festive period and this was the perfect opportunity. Skip Christmas, fast forward to New Years eve 10 pm i'm sitting on my own getting stoned. My Christmas detox had failed, every night except Christmas night i smoked. I even went to the extremes of on 26th December my dealer wasn't around, but i had matched a stoner looking girl off Tinder, yup my efforts to get weed know no rules ! 

Ill be honest from January to May time it was a bit of a blur, I tried quitting on many many occasions managing a few days and then relapsing. Those days i did manage to quit I noticed the change in me, more talkative and generally better mood, but when you have an addiction you don't do whats good for you.

This story does have a change in it though, June 2019 I quit. I booked a holiday with some friends and wanted to be clear headed and not going through all the withdrawals whilst away, two weeks before we went I managed to put weed down. Life was good, i got into reading (which i never had done) the gym was where i was 5 days a week and my life was back on track and for the first time in my life without a vice. Short lived where those days, middle of July and i was bored one evening an old flame who was also a stoner convinced me it was a good idea for her to come over and yes that 5/6 week break made getting high fun again and so the cycle begun yet again. It didn't take more than 2 weeks from that date to me buying back from my old dealer every other day. 

I tried keeping my life going whilst slowly letting weed back in. The gym frequency decreased rapidly (i don't go anymore) i haven't touched a book except to roll a roach from and my production at work is non existent.

I'm now sitting here on Evening 2 without weed getting ready for my second sleep with no THC. My palms are sweaty and i'm bored out my mind and i know ill struggle to sleep. I've forgotten so quickly what those brief summer months where like sober. I wrote this to kill time and get it all of my chest with no judgement and i'm probably waffling.

I need your help.

I was a chronic smoker from from 18 to 23. When I was 24 I moved to a new country and started a new life alone. I always wanted to explore the world and this was a place that called to me right away. I wanted to get away from smoking. I had been around it all of my life although only really aware of it when I was 15/16.  It made me paranoid, about who I was, what I was worth and where my place was in the world. When I moved I stopped for a little while but before I knew it I was back smoking. It wasnt as much as before but still enough that I maintained all of my negative feelings and started to isolate myself from the world.

Fast forward a year and I meet a woman who I fall head over heals for. Luckily for me she feels the same way and we instantly click. We've been together for 2 years now and things are going from strenght to strenght. Its the most open, honest and happiest I've ever been with somebody. I want to spend my life with her.

For 10 months I stopped smoking. I didnt take a single puff even with its increased availability and numerous opportunitys around me. I was happy, healthy and free. I was proud. It was the longest time I had ever went without smoking in the last 8 years. My mind never really thought it would be forever, but for the forseeable future sure. She goes to visit her family one weekend alone and I cant help it, I break.

Anyway, I've been hiding it since then. She has noticed it a few times and we have argued about it. She knows about my troubles with it and has had her own but was able to move away from it completly. I grew up around it and so to me it has the same status as alcohol. Whats the harm in some once in a while, especially if I keep it to myself and dont abuse it.
 
I try to keep it to the times where I know I will be alone and will have very little interaction with anybdoy. I feel guilt for doing it behind her back, paranoid that I will get caught and really just dissapointed with myself. I sacfricied my life in my home country and I still cant stop. There is something in me that keeps convincing myself its okay to smoke. It is okay, I know that, but I dont think its okay for me.

I want to break this cycle but I feel like I cant. Please help me.",1,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.907680869102478}"

Stopped twice before once 17 years ago for 10 months and once 15 years ago for 6.I've literally grown up with weed, smoking since 13.. I graduated high school and college with it, lost my twin brother to a drunk driver accident with it, married, 3 kids with it. Created all my social interactions with it.  I literally don't remember life without it...

What I do know is weed doesn't help me as much as I thought.  It makes me go to sleep later. It makes me tired in the morning. It makes me slower at work. It causes me to react emotionally when I otherwise wouldn't. It causes me to put off activities that would benefit my family such as a side gig based on my skill sets. It causes me to spend money when I could save it and have a yearly family vacation. It causes me to spend time away from my family more than i think is reasonable. Weed also causes me to stunt my vision and future growth. Most of all its taken away my sense of self, the creative, joyful youthful person I was who had great ideas and activities to do, I feel like I've lost some of that.

Sorry for the rant, guess I just wanted to vent, I've been lurking for a while and now that i'm stepping up to plate I am nervous and worried, I've thought through some anticipated roadblocks such as what I will tell myself when the cravings come, or what to do in the evenings when the feeling of boredom hits (Planning to just go to sleep early hopefully) but i still have doubts because I've failed a few times recently to follow through and gave in way too easily.

I tried avoiding definite statements in case I fail, so my failure is not obvious to others, but im serious, I want to do better, so I can't half ass it anymore, will post updates if anyone cares to read them

Quitting for a job.,"I honestly don’t want to quit. But I want this job more than I want cannabis. I started smoking when I was 18, and I immediately fell in love with it. I was high whenever I had the chance. As I’ve gotten older, all of my friends who used to smoke have quit to focus on careers and family. Meanwhile, I still work for the same company I always have, and I’m just as single and alone as ever. Every morning I wake up early to smoke. I live near my office and have an hour lunch break, so I come home and smoke on my break. As soon as I get home for the night, I smoke. My ideal Saturday or Sunday is spent on my couch with a 30%+ THC strain. I don’t even really get that high anymore. But I still absolutely love it. I love the flavor, the smell, the warm hug it wraps me in. I live in a legal state, and I can afford it. It’s just so easy to keep using.

But I have to quit. I have the opportunity to finally get a career. A really well paying, exciting career. This career means random drug tests though. So I’m not just quitting until I pass one drug test, I’m quitting for good. And I’m not excited about quitting. But I am so excited about this job. I have to do it.

I have 5 months until I have to pass a drug test, but I’m quitting now. At first I tried tapering off, but I just don’t have the willpower for that. I just gathered all of my smoking paraphernalia and tossed it in the dumpster.

I’m hoping once I have a week or two of sobriety under my belt, I’ll start to see some more positives of quitting. Right now I’m just depressed.

It's only natural, am I right?), you guys are all doing the best you can and you all deserve a pat on the back. Things can be really stressful and rough this time of the year, so *please* don't be so hard on yourselves. Being overly self-critical of yourself and your issues/shortcomings is hardly constructive and could make things even harder for you, so maybe try to focus on the positives you've got going for you, and try to hold onto those as an inspiration for trying to stay sober :)  


I totally get how hard it can be to keep your head straight this time of the year; the holidays and some stuff I was going through last year actually did a lot to undo my own sobriety and it set me back a lot emotionally. I went through the worst breakup of my life last year and had my last contact with that partner in December, and the feelings it stirred up did a lot to undue the sobriety I had worked myself up to after we had split up. She didn't know it, but a big part of why I left was because I was unhappy with my reliance on THC to be happy and how I needed to just clear my head for a while. The experience of trying to apologize for things ending between us and her... not entirely being receptive of that, did a lot of harm to me and it actually made me relapse pretty bad. Like, spend the next 10 months in a haze whenever I wasn't at my office job bad.

2019-12-09 06:15:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e88o52/hello_again/,Hello again,"today is my 1st day of combined cannabis & nicotine quitting. I was getting very used to quitting in the last 2 years (\~8 month without, several quittings&relapses). What i found out for me with my several attempts is that every qutitting had its own ""main focus"" withdrawal. The last one was mostly heavy depressed mood, the attempt before was focused on insomnia. The last 3 relapses took place \~4 weeks after quitting, which is very poor.

So why did i start again vaping the last time? Simple: I was offered organically grown premium bud for free, i knew somebody who was growing it exactly the way it has to be grown in my view...i wanted it so badly. Soon after starting again (last week of october) i also smoked before my job, so again 24h high.  

The most severe problem with my on-off-junky situation is that i do not get out of this viscious circle. when it is ""hightime"" i can not remember things, can not talk to people, can not go out (only if there is absolutely nothing to eat in my flat), can (!) not watch tv(bc too stupid to remember what was 2 mins before, no context), only hiding from everyone and everything (except work; i hate my job/colleagues/boss; but of course i need money which is still so much connected to weed in my mind, so auto-job-mode is on).

when ""sobertime"" starts, then i am so depressed/fucked off that i can not do normal things like household, opening mails (the last 2 years only 10% of mails were read, problems will show up soon i fear). for example i live here in my ""new"" flat exactly one year...still did not install lamps everywhere, no mirrors, everything dusty here, it just looks like a junkies flat. I do have absolutely no motivation to do anything which is normal to normal people...anything but watching tv, playing videogames, reading (started to read 2017),  i do not do these things when i am high. maybe i am just lazy??

hopefully it is just that, but it is not. when looking back to my teenager-time with all the knowledge about dopamin, its natural synthesis in our bodies, about serotonin and what drugs do with that systems, it shows that it was a predestined way for me to get a substance-dependent. I did not eat (good) as older child and teenie. I denied proteins (do not why), just ate sweets, tons of sweets.  

This was the first step to throw the dopamine system out of the way. Without proper proteins you do not have enough of the raw substance to produce hormones, now i know. I just compensated it with dopamin-releasing sweets, a downward spiral was born. 

Soon after i got into videogames. But with no limits, i played day and night. The first time I was confronted with withdrawals like highest agression, hate, sweating...was when my parents decided to try to limit it. My behaviour was so bad, that the let me play again. 

Searching for what every teen is searching for, nothing was good enough for me. I developed interest in nothing. Nothing instead of dopamin flushes, and soon i found out that nicotine was good for that. I never thought  consciously about it, at this time. 

With eating tons of sweets,  playing day and night and smoking nicotine i was ""dopamined"" without doing anything (anything regarding things to do which normally releases dopamin). With no interests, no aims, but constantly ""satisfied"" at least for a few seconds after consumption i found weed to enlarge the satisfiying-time for few hours. That was great. With all the dopamin in my brain i even went to school again, did quite well, as long as i was constantly high. Artificial interest was developed, pseudo-aims were set. I thought and feeled like they were real, now i know it just were  means for the purpose. The purpose was: without school, no work. Work=money=weed. I never liked what i learned, business study and industrial engineering. i got the diplomas, and hate this unnecessary shit. But it is my only way to make money... with all the holes in my  curriculum vitae and 35y old there is not a chance to switch (fucking Germany). Additionally, with no interest at all, i even do not know what could be a good job for me. Crazy.

Thanks god I didnt get addicted to hard drugs like amphetamine (liked it sooo much) or opioids (hate it). The reason is that i knew they are dangerous. Nicotine is different, and weed is/was not known for being dangerous.

So here I am again, my aim now is to help my brain to develop a proper dopamin system. Of course I dont really know how to with all the lack of interest .  In my eyes, the often mentioned ""discipline"" is mostly a matter of a functioning rewarding system. Without that system...you know thats why I will work to develop it. Step by step.

Me : 38 yo stoner. 20 years of smoking. Only evenings. 3 joints. Besides that I still manage to have organised life and do a ton of sports regularly. So why quit ? I have one huge problem related to weed. I must smoke 5min before bed and this causes to wake up at 2 every night to eat. Yes. It started 8 years ago when I started do sports. I finish sports in the evening and then smoke. After I smoke I don’t feel like hungry. I go to bed and the wake up. Outcome : I haven’t slept well for 8 years now. I tried to skip last joint but it is harder than not smoking at all.
So here I am again trying not to smoke. Last time (last December) I quit and was super-overwhelmed by sober life. So I did treat myself because of success by trip to USA. First day in SF.... all this smoke scent on the streets : I bought a bag and spent whole trip smoking and sightseeing. Now my plan is to plan in advance my moves and avoid any situations weed related. Those triggers are killing me. Momentum is a cruel mistress. You all probably know what I mean:) Why I am writing it ? Commuting to someone (or a group of people) always motivates me. That’s it.

A few months ago I asked my best friend and roommate to move out. We started together years ago and smoked together almost daily. 
I had realized that having the option to go into a room where there was a joint that was almost always lit and a friend that was happy to share, was too much. 
She has also talked about quitting but I can't want for that to happen. Especially since it honestly doesn't seem like she even believes she can survive going a day without and thinks going to NA will make it magically happen someday. I'm not going to bet on that. Even though she agreed to move out she has pretty much ignored me since then. I don't think we are friends anymore. We were so close before I hope it's going to be worth it. 

For a while, I have tried different things. Only smoking at the weekend, only smoking with friends and so on. As soon as cannabis entered my apartment I would keep rolling joints until it was gone. I couldn't just leave it for later.

Tree weeks ago my pet seemed a little drowsy. Since he was very old I cleared the day to be with him, but instead, I ended up spending the day in another room smoking joints. Saying to myself I will go to him after I have smoked the next one. Around six ""last"" joints later I finally went to him and he was dead. 

This is not the first time I chose joints over time with loved ones. I did it more times than I can remember. 

I got so pissed at myself. Here I go again wasting all my time smoking joints and watching cartoons. Prioritizing it over pretty much everything. 

I wish I could say that was the last straw, but I spend the weekend after that consuming strong edibles. 

Two weeks ago I decided to stop. I couldn't lie to myself any longer. I'm addicted. Cannabis is not a miracle drug that helped my depression, it just made me okay with doing nothing. 

Last week I found my grinder, and I realized I had collected enough kief for a joint. 
I should have thrown it out, but I convinced myself it'll be the perfect last joint. 

I haven't smoked anything but cigs since then. 

I don't think I'll be able to do this alone. 
My city has NA, but there is a problem with that. My roomie, who is moving out this month, goes there. 
Being in the same room as her is hard. She acts like I'm not even there. I know I have to go but it keeps me away. 

As an alternative, I found this sub. Reading the posts here helps.
I feel like you see weed being presented as a perfect cure for everything lately, and I need an escape for that.

I felt a bit high (always had a super high tolerance to butter) but didn't even think to recognize it as being high on THC since I didn't ingest any.

However, when I found this sub I found the reason I was randomly scrolling this site.

ME: 41(f)-started smoking at 15 after being sexual assaulted while intoxicated on alcohol. I couldn’t stand the smell of alcohol after that- always reminding me of the event. 

Shortly after I found a new comfort. MJ became a life saver or at least a band-aid for a good long time. Spent the next 10 years smoking daily. At 25, I met a man who didn’t smoke, very straight edge in general. We got married, had three kids. 

Hey, guess what? Marriage to a mismatched partner during a traumatized and addicted state of life isn’t going to solve your problems- even if you lay down your crutch, temporarily. I quit smoking for 8 years while having my babes and trying to forget why I ever smoked in the first place.  That worked for a time.  Financial struggles forced  me back into restaurant work, waiting tables again, but now with 3 kids under 6.  

Cut to 5 years later... you know the story. Went from one bud given to me by a coworker, feeling- boy I won’t do that again; so guilty and scared that someone in my straight edge, conservative christian life would find out.  To a month later I asked my coworker for the number of his plug . I had a steady connection, cash in hand- my sweet old friend coming back to save me from myself.  All the while, I KNEW it was going to be struggle to give this up- I had lived it before. 

In my world, a habit like this meant I had to sneak, lie and hide. My husband was/is absolutely against the use of even the mildest of drugs- for a while insisting that even anti-depressants were bad for your brain.  

I always wanted to quit. Knew this is a ridiculous waste of time, money and energy. I was embarrassed- even amongst smoker friends who couldn’t understand how I went through my stash So. Damn. Fast.   They were always telling me -“just don’t smoke so much- pace yourself- make it last”.

I don’t think I need to explain to anyone here how or why I just could not, why it was never that easy.

Today- I am here. After a year+ of therapy, a diagnosis of bi-polar 2 and proper medication- I began to feel like it was possible to say goodbye to my friend again. Even still, I spent more months and months psyching myself up for ACTUALLY quitting. I knew it my heart that I WOULD do it....as soon as I mentally could handle it. I trusted myself that I would know when it was time. I credit improving my mental health, meds and therapy to get me to the point that i felt ready. I ran out and haven’t gotten more. 

Day 10: the first week was everything I expected: diarrhea and nausea, hot/ cold sweats, shaking, and sleepless at night and exhausted all day, no appetite. 

Week two- god help us- I’m in the “everyone must die” phase of irritation and anger.

I check in here everyday, throughout the day, just to remind myself that this is real, other people are going through this and I CAN quit! My best friends roll their eyes at the idea of having withdrawals from pot. But HELLO r/leaves FRIENDs!! This is no joke- just reading about others who are experiencing this too gives me strength. I don’t feel so alone in this. Thanks for the community. 

EDITED TO ADD: I also left my husband 7 months ago which gave me the space to deal with this on my own terms. Do what you’ve got to do.

TL:DR ( had to look up that acronym -ha) : 

1. Daily, alllll day smoker finally makes it 10 days after 25 years of off and on dependency.
2. This is real, it is hard, but we all deserve true comfort, real healing and authentic, unfiltered connection with the world around us. 
3. **I began by noticing, to myself, that each time I smoked *nothing in my life had actually changed*. ALLL  the same shit I was “escaping” was still there. 
	LIKE THIS:  “Hey lady, look inside, look around you — smoking hasn’t fixed anything, changed anything, or actually helped you in anyway. In an hour, 	when you want smoke again, that will still be true.”**   
	This helped a lot with the slow process of facing facts and removing the disillusion that marijuana made life better in any way.",201,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979008436203003}"

This is it. I finally want to stop and I'm about to.

A bit ago I found myself in the middle of a period with lots of blood and no feminine hygiene products, but you bet I had money for weed before it started! I've smoked on 3 continents because I'm incapable of taking a break and found illicit and incredibly dangerous avenues to get some weed. I'm coming to just hate myself.

It is absolutely wild that many refuse to call this an addiction. It can be just as bad as anything else--it's just more insidious and you have to advocate for yourself because you will be chastised the same way I am when I disclose that I just don't drink.


I'm ready to quit and my psychiatrist is behind me. I've tried before but I've never really wanted to. I just knew I should.


But now I'm sick of enduring gross tasting oil just to run it out so I could go spend $20 on something tastier from my good ol' dispensary right down the road. Walking distance...  


I have no doubt it will be hard, but my bipolar brain is feeling it and I want to feel something else. It doesn't even feel good to be high anymore it makes me paranoid and anxious and inexplicably I want to  cry a little bit every few hours. 


My medications finally seem like they're stabilizing me and weed is fucking it all up I know it. 


Some people can use responsibly. I am not one of those people.

Thank you to this community for existing and being so supportive and inspirational at times.

I just keep reminding myself that weed is NOT my medicine even if it is someone else's, and for me it's actually what my real medicine is fighting against right now.


Somethjng like 15% of bipolar people commit suicide and I don't want to add to that because I wanted to get high all day every day.

I didn't try it until I was 21. I am now 30.

I quit drinking after self medicating for years (to the point my skin was turning grey, it was bad) and relapsed a few times while trying to get clean. I haven't drank for a long time. I am proud of that. The guilt I felt after and with the help of a therapist helped me to stop drinking. Now I am taking the next step and trying to get sober all the way. I've never had any issues with any other drugs except weed.

I have reduced from being a chronic smoker to almost nothing in about a week. I went from 3-6 bowls of flower per day, to only 1 bowl as of yesterday. Its been hard just reducing. I already notice some withdrawal signs. Nausea and anxiety mostly. Disturbed sleep as of last night.

I guess this all just shows me how much I have been running away and that I need off of it.

I'm so tired of running from my problems with substances. 

What I can tell you is that when I did smoke that 1 bowl yesterday, I was SO depressed, extremely paranoid <--- this was the freaky out of control part, and actually wound up having a panic attack. So essentially it hit me again that this is why I have to quit. I am already bipolar and smoking isn't so great for people with more serious mental illnesses. I've known people who have smoked with more severe mental health cases and it doesn't end well. By that I mean they were either hospitalized and being diagnosed with Schizophrenia or lost their family or anything they hold dear. (Schizophrenia is rare with long term smoking but still possible obviously. I read it from this article so I'm not just saying it to say it.  Link here.

I've been a stoner since I was 18. Back then it was only the occasional puff with friends from school, but as I got older and moved out of my parents place, I really ramped up my dope use. I've been, likely for the last 4 years, using multiple times everyday. 

Here's my routine:

1) Wake up, immediately get high before my shower.

2) Go to work slightly high, ride that for 6 - 8 hours.

3) Go home, immediately, like the first thing I do, light up a bowl. Multiple bowls. 5, 6, 7 easily over the night. 

4) Rince & repeat.

For the LONGEST time, I assumed my weed use was totally harmless. I assumed it was safer on the body than booze or smokes, and that there would be no long-term issues or dependancies developed. And I can say with complete certainty that the body absolutely can become addicted to weed and it's extremely harmful to yourself and others.

The biggest thing that weed killed for me was my appetite. My body learned to only get hungry when I was ""munchin'"", so anytime I didn't have weed, I simply wouldn't be hungry. And people would try to feed me (family dinners, etc), and I'd eat a small portion, feel sick, go home, toke fat, and feel all better.

The psychological issues at play here are numerous. I'm sure there's some Pavlov law about doing X Y Z before an activity and it gets baked into your brain. My body simply would not get hungry on it's own. Constantly waiting for the THC & appetite changes that followed.

These issues have become very pervasive and noticeable now. It's affecting people I care about. The sleeplessness is also terrible. It makes me less alert, more irritable, and less focused. But I'm determined now to beat it.

I hope to live into my 50's and 60's, and if it were like I live today... it simply wouldn't be worth it. Like the alcoholic or chronic smoker, I've used pot as a crutch for many years, and never really grasped how much it affected me. Until today.

I'm making a commitment to stop, and I hope that this message inspires  others who are dealing with similar challenges. Your issues are valid. Your symptoms are real. Progress starts today.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9347981810569763}"

Me like the rest of you loved weed, it’s the perfect antidote to a hard day at work, it makes you forget about any problems you have, it makes life fun in the moment. 
Initially when stopping I found myself bored as shit on the sofa, wondering how to get through those hours between work and going to bed. Pick up a book, go to the local bar/pub, go meet that friend you always planned to meet when high, go and do that run that you told your high self you needed.
Weed is a great social lubricant. Most of my closest friend in uni smoked. We forged close relationships around smoking, but I also lost connection with other friends who didn’t smoke.
If you’re here considering stopping then you’re much better off than a lot of the (don’t mean to be rude) deluded stoners. Weed isn’t bad for you in the short term, it helps you get through the day. It helps you relax after a day at work. It helps you enjoy the thing you normally do. 
But is that right? Is it right to live your life in a haze? Would you pay a $10-20 subscription a day to “enjoy your life”?

I always prided myself on being funny and quick-witted growing up, however since becoming sober I notice all that has gone away. My mind used to be going in all sorts of directions, I’d be thinking about something almost constantly, and was able to connect and relate to people with ease. I used to get joy in being social and now that I’ve gotten sober I find that I simply don’t have anything to say, like my mind just feels blank, or flat(?) most of the time, and not in a zen, enlightened sort of way, more in a hollow, zombified kind of state. I feel like I’m in a perpetual identity crisis . . .

As a result I isolate myself and fear human interaction because I don’t know how to connect with people anymore, which makes me even more lonely and isolated. It’s also effected my academics (never been a great student), I’m 26 and trying to go back to college but can’t seem to find the mental capability to do any sort of critical thinking required to do the assignments (or just critical thinking in general).

There are plenty of benefts to quitting weed after being addicted to it.

But there's one benefit that kinda gets swept under the rug after it's initial return...

Your dreams.

And when I say dreams, I mean that literally. Night time mind movies.

At first they tend to burst back into your life right when you quit. Your body needs to catch up on lost REM sleep.

But most of the time, that's all the attention that dream receive in the marijuana withdrawal community.

There is power that comes from familiarizing yourself with your dreams.

Your dreams are your subconsious way of interpreting your past, present, and future and communicating your current trajectory to your concious mind.

It's your subconscious mind's way of showing you the problem it's currently solving.

So if you're looking for a way to increase your self-awareness, and therefore, your self-acceptance and respect, one classic method is to pay attention to your dreams.

The best way I've found to do this is right when you wake up, when the dream is fresh on your mind, open up a note on your smartphone and use speech-to-text. Go over every detail you can remember, sometimes the helicopter crashing in the background of your dream is meaningful. 

Once you record all your dreams, then email them to a special email address. 

The key here is to do this over a long period of time. It's not about cracking the interpretation of one dream, but rather finding out what your dreams are telling you over week-long, month-long, year-long spans.

Plus it's kind of fun. Your subconscious feeds you information in your dream well before your concious mind gets a hold of it, if it ever does at  all.",65,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9790013432502747}"

I don’t have issues with substances or alcohol, weed is my one weakness and I’ve used that as an excuse for a long time. I honestly don’t think I need rehab, but I do need a group like this to reassure me that I’m making the right choice by quitting. Reading through people’s posts while alone, nauseous, and crying from the first day of withdrawal made me feel like I was going to be ok. So thank you! 

Long personal stuff I just wanna get off my chest now that I’ve gotten thru the first day cold turkey: I’ve had a problem  with weed for the past 3 years of my life and had relapsed for about six months. I’m very fortunate that I got into it in my 20s and not high school. The worst year of my life was the year I graduated undergrad. I hurt the trust of sober friends, I was a lazy roommate, and I wasn’t coping with my diagnosed anxiety/depression. I hadn’t been to one on one therapy before and didn’t have the mental coping mechanisms I needed. So instead I self medicated with weed. I had a breakdown at my cousins wedding and went thru terrible withdrawals. The nausea was the worst. I have a sensitive stomach to begin with and smoked weed to help that. The mental loops my brain went through debating whether to smoke followed by the shame of disappointing the people who care about me. 

I got my shit together, went to therapy, got a lot of support from people in my life, got into my dream graduate program and have been living a much better life. That’s when I convinced myself I can indulge. “I’m different now! I can handle it!” Was my thinking. “I live in a state where it’s legal! I don’t have to be paranoid and I can hide it from the people I care about back home!”

While it’s true that I’m doing much better now than in the past, it’s not because of weed. It’s because I’ve worked on myself and accepted the help from people around me. 

The reason I quit recently is because I felt myself slipping. My memory was going, I was getting mood swings, emotionally avoiding, wasting money, and the guilt was building. I was hiding this from everyone, including my therapist. I decided to reach out and look for stories from people in my situation and found this subreddit. It made me feel like I wasn’t a broken person and understand the nature of my problem.

So I grabbed my stash and my pipe and threw it in the trash. I immediately felt like a huge burden was lifted. 

I maintain several close friendships with people who don’t smoke. I’m grateful I don’t have to cut them off (and visa versa) and they’ve been there for me through a lot. Some of my friends have been hurt by loved ones with substance issues and have expressed distress to me in the past over my smoking habits. I quit for them in the past after they confronted me, but when I relapse without them knowing, I feel horrible. I felt like I was betraying them and can’t imagine how hurt they would be if they found out. I know they don’t want to control me, they just saw my problem before I did. I owe it to them to get better. 

Things that help me: Spend time with the people you care about, keep yourself busy, DISTRACT YOURSELF  with activities to drown out the addict voice. Be kind to yourself and be patient. Thank you and I wish all you happiness and health.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9154447913169861}"

Sorry for the format; I'm on mobile.

Basically the title says it all.

I've been clean and not bought any in 1 month. I'm sitting in my car after taking my last regular exam before my final exam for college algebra.

Math is so hard. My brain hurts. I want to cry. I want to smoke. I want to vape. I want to just sink into the calmness of what I remember.

But that's exactly it. I hate how I feel like I need it. I hate feeling dependent on something else to make me feel better. Yet I just want to cry. I primarily used to vape after relapsing already a 2nd time after being 1.5 years clean. I became a parent and caved into the easy habit of vaping.

For Thanksgiving I vowed to just stop buying. Many of these posts here have truly extremely helped. I feel these posts so much. It goes from control to addiction so quickly. From 1 time a day to when I'm stressed to every hour if not more.

I cant. My money has been so nice saving. I put 25$ every week for 4 weeks into a travel fund piggy bank I have on my desk. I can literally see the money starting to pile up. 25$ was my vape cost plus a bit more. I have 100$ in savings now from not smoking this whole month.

Yet right now as I sit in my car from class.. the shop is literally 5 mins/4 blocks/ walking distance (legal in Ca for med and rec). I want to go so bad.

I messaged my husband. I told him this. He respects my right to choose. He told me he wouldn't tell me no if I wanted to go get some vape oil to relieve stress.

Please help. I am distracting myself from going by typing this out. Remembering why I dont want to keep smoking. Remembering the tightness from so much vaping. Remembering how clear my head feels now even though I'm stressed.

Thank you if you have gotten this far for listening. Thank you for seeing me in a moment of weakness and helping me feel. I dont want to go to the shop. I dont want to buy. I want to be in control. Its slipping but I'm holding onto it with everything I have in my being.

Edit to add: Thank you for the priceless beautiful words. Thank you for letting me know people still care.

I've been an everyday smoker for atleast 10 years & I have been going back & forth with quitting now for the last year... Just this past week I've gotten very serious about it. I've had a hard time committing to stopping before because I can't think of something motivating to help me stop. I've quit before for 3 months to get my job but then I started smoking again... Now my job doesn't test for weed anymore so that made me feel better about continuing to smoke... Recently I have been dealing with undiagnosed seizures & the medication I am taking is giving me really bad memory loss (or could be side of effect of seizures as well) but I can tell smoking weed is not helping with the memory loss... I can't drink right now because of my seizure medication so it scares me to stop smoking at all... Even when I stopped smoking for 3 months I was drinking more so being completely sober is scary... My boyfriend & I are also trying to have a baby, & although I don't think the weed effects us conceiving, I'm sure it doesn't help either... So my problem is that now that I am serious about quitting, it's hard to quit because of the people around me. My little sister is staying with me until about February & we smoke sooooo much together. My boyfriend smokes as well, but he is not as much as a smoker as me so if it was just us I could successfully quit. How the fuck do I stop smoking if there is still weed & paraphernalia around? I want to quit but a part of me also thinks of delaying quitting until my sister moves out... I have been lurking on this page for the last week & it's given me so much motivation to quit but it's so hard, every second...",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974205493927002}"

It would be like moving to the countryside after living in the city; we perceive sobriety as boring because every time we were bored we had a foolproof solution to it in weed. The people in the “countryside” know it’s boring, and therefore have gotten used to that notion and have found ways to distract themselves, therefore it is an obvious concept that it is boring - so obvious that it deserves no thought or time spent thinking about it. Consider it, in quitting we have just moved to the “countryside”, so we have to experience the boredom to learn the painful truth that you can not replicate being high 24/7 in sobriety. Sober people still do complain about life being boring, my non-smoking friends surely attest that they are also very bored, but the idea is not novel to them, it has been like this for all 19 years of their lives. It is novel to us since we’re only just getting used to quote unquote normal life.

Quit 14 days ago. 

Experienced extreme withdrawal symptoms (see my other posts). 

So scared I went to NYU Oral Cancer Center. They said my mouth was very, very dry. 

So dry that it has accelerated gum disease I didn’t know I had — until I pulled down my lower lip and saw the gums pulling away from the teeth, and red and purple spots. My back molar teeth hurts and jaw is sore. My teeth feel like they are shifting and the slightest bit loose. 

What’s scary is how quickly my gums deteriorated. I went to the dentist and got the all clear 1 month ago, and then after quitting smoking, everything happened within a few weeks. 

Research shows long term marijuana use is linked to periodontal disease:

https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/long-term-marijuana-use-associated-with-periodontal-disease/

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823391/

In addition, my salivary glands don’t seem to work as well anymore, I have constant dry mouth which wakes me up choking at night — and contributed to further tooth and gum decay in a vicious cycle. 

Once again, research links reduced salivary gland function to long-term effects of smoking marijuana, effectively giving you permanent dry mouth (xerostomia): 

“Studies have shown that long-term smoking significantly reduces salivary flow. This reduction is tied to an increase in oral health disorders associated with xerostomia, including dental decay, gingivitis, tooth mobility and halitosis.”

https://www.ada.org/member-center/oral-health-topics/cannabis

I am buying tons of products to help with the dry mouth and hoping and praying I will be able to recover more salivary gland function over time, but I may have permanently damaged my body’s ability to do so. Acupuncture might be a good option.

As for the gum disease, I find out next week how bad it is and whether I will need teeth extracted or worse. For sure I will now have to undergo deep root cleanings at least every 3 months. 

I’ve quit a few times before and never caught hell like this. I suppose my time caught up with me in the end. 

If you’re reading this and have been smoking less than 15 years, please consider quitting, as that seems to be the time that long term damage really starts kicking in irreversibly. 

I have had zero urges to smoke since this all went down. I wish I’d stopped 5 years ago, the last time I truly attempted to quit.

Then stopped smoking during the years, but then in my town they dealers were only selling creepy and as I am from Venezuela, I experienced almost one year with the public university closed for politcal reasons. This year with free time, I started smoking more. 

With the pass of time, today Im 30 and currently living in Brazil, I went from smoking only in december and january to smoking the whole year and not being able to stop. Smoking its just bringing me bad consequences. For example I lost a job that wasnt the best but the payment was not bad (teaching English). Broke up with my girlfriend. Im also a musician and realized that I used to study more when I was smoking less in the past days.

My life changed too much since I had to move from my family´s house to another country and work as free lancer. I must be like really organized to have my life going ok. Love this website and all you are sharing about your personal experience,

I’m getting married and moving across the country next month, stopped smoking weed, etc. But even when I have basically every reason to be content and happy I still just feel.. meh. That’s why I smoked so much weed, it distracted me from that thought and I could actually enjoy the things I like to enjoy like video games youtube etc. now I can’t help but feel it’s all pointless. I just feel a constant unsettled feeling, I don’t even want the weed I just am so bored and tired of existing and weed makes me forget that. The main reason I haven’t smoked again is because where I’m moving weed isn’t legal so I had no choice so I know I have to adjust to life with out it if that’s gonna work. But I feel like I’m gonna get there and still feel bored and unsatisfied with everything, even though I love my fiancé and am excited to be with him and live my life. 20% of the time I have that positive attitude but anytime I have down time it’s hard not to think what’s the point in living.

If you’ve quit for a day, a week, or a month, it doesn’t matter - you didn’t quit because you dislike weed (I would imagine)... you quit because you lack self control. 

If you’re a day, or week, or month, or year in, and say, “see I can quit just fine”, then you’re still controlled by your desire for escapism. You still don’t have control. If you’re thinking about it daily, you still don’t have control. If you’re thinking “I’ve quit for long enough”, you still don’t have control

When you return to weed, it needs to be like returning to green beans, if you haven’t had them in a while. You don’t count the days since you last had green beans, you don’t care if you don’t finish your green beans and throw them away. You can have them right in front of you and be indifferent. 

Once you are truly, truly, indifferent to smoking again, then you can smoke freely. I have quit for months and not been over it then relapsed, and was quickly addicted again, because the addiction was still alive, waiting to be fed again. Only if your honest with yourself, will you know that you’re truly in a different place. I doubt I will be for years. 

I will not smoke with you today. I may tomorrow, but just not today. I am still addicted. Good thing tomorrow isn’t real. 

Weed isn’t going anywhere, and you’re not going anywhere while your still in a hole. Get out of the hole and you just may realize that weed was never the problem, it was just the solution. Fix the problem, then you can truly enjoy weed again, if you so choose at the time. 

Peace.

2019-12-05 12:42:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e6kme6/my_current_situation_the_price_and_impact_of_weed/,My Current Situation - The Price and Impact of Weed,"I smoked weed for the first time when I was 16 during a summer trip visiting family in Ontario. I hadn’t been there in years. At some point during the trip, I met up with my cousin, I hadn’t seen her since we were children. We caught up and I ended up walking to a fair that was going on nearby. We met up with some of her friends, and we ended up getting in their vehicle. They lit up a joint and started to pass it around. I remember in junior high and high school being so against weed, telling my best friend at the time that if he ever did it I wouldn’t be friends with him anymore (lol). Anyways, for some reason, in that moment, perhaps in the bliss of hanging out with my cousin I hadn’t seen since childhood, in total acceptance of the moment I also accepted that joint. We all hotboxed the vehicle. At first I don’t recall it affecting me too strongly, it was a very slow oncoming thing. We went and rode the rides, and that’s when it started hitting. I remember a feeling of pure joy and connection with these people while we were spinning around extremely fast on a ride, and I was having an amazing time.

We walked back towards her place later which was just outside of this small town, and we had to walk a sort of country road in the dark. This is when the paranoia started kicking in, the road was lined with mailboxes every once in a while in front of houses, and I remember looking at them from a distance and thinking each one was a police officer, in a total state of fear over being arrested. My cousin suggested that we go to her neighbours place, whom she was friends with. I agreed to that.

We got there and there were two people there. We ended up smoking even more weed with them. I remember being extremely high. Then it was suggested that we watch a horror movie. They put on a movie called “The Devil’s Chair” and I sat cross legged on the floor directly in front of the tv while the others were on the couch, totally focused on this terrifying movie. I remember them laughing and having a good time with how high I was.

After that, when I returned home to Alberta, it was a long time before I smoked again. I’m not sure if it’s related, but in Grade 10-12 there was a sort of shift in my personality. I started doing extremely poorly in school, didn’t put any effort in, didn’t care about anything, and was in a constant state of misery and depression. This period of time is the first time I recall having anxiety. I started to feel like I wasn’t worthy to talk to people, like I was uninteresting, like I wasn’t valuable. I remember feeling like I was not worthy to talk to people who I previously had no issues with. I finished high school and lived with my grandmother for a while, and then I moved back in with my mom and her fiancée. All this time I didn’t smoke any weed.

Eventually another cousin of mine asked me if I wanted to move to the city with her, her then boyfriend (now husband) and his best friend. I felt like this was my opportunity to move on to better things and start advancing my life forward in a city with the opportunity that that entailed, and so I accepted.

I moved in, and shortly after, I found out pretty quickly that my cousins bf’s friend was a huge pothead. At first it really bothered and annoyed me. I remember him coming home late from work, I would usually be up late in my room playing video games, and he would always knock on my door and come and sit on my bed and watch me play, as he was a huge gamer as well. He always smelt very strongly of weed, and at the time I did not enjoy the smell of skunky weed and always felt annoyed while he was in there with me. The other roommates were very frustrated with him often and there was a lot of tension because he was rather messy, leaving pizza all over in the basement and getting stains everywhere and such, and he would smoke in the bathroom with the fan on at night thinking that the rest of us didn’t notice, but we all did.

Anyways, one night he offered me a joint. I went outside with him and stood on the front step and smoked with him. At the time the effect on me was incredibly strong. He was a regular stoner so it obviously didn’t effect him like it did I. We went inside and he casually went downstairs to play some video games and told me to come down if I wanted and play. I didn’t. Instead I sat on a chair in the kitchen and made obnoxious faces (without a mirror present), laughing nonstop at the image in my head of the obnoxious faces I was making... that’s how strongly this stuff affected me at the time.

Every once in a while, I would go out with him and smoke a joint. Now at the time, my first job in the city was at a Futureshop (same as Best Buy, no longer exists now it’s just Best Buy). I loved this job, it was right up my alley, I only worked in the warehouse but I loved working around tech. Now looking back this is when my anxiety took control of me. In hindsight I have to assume the weed had a role to play. I used to feel so fearful of offending customers, not knowing how to take care of them, doing something wrong, getting in trouble, not working hard enough, most of all just feeling fearful of not being perfect around customers. The feeling was so overwhelming that sometimes I would have to go in the bathroom, lock myself in a stall and cry.

My cousin and her boyfriend were not into weed. I knew he had smoked it before with his friend obviously, but he definitely wasn’t a pothead. My cousin had never even done it before. One day it was just the three of us at home, and for one reason or another her boyfriend suggested that he knew where he could get some and we could try it out together tonight. We went and got some and I remember being excited about it. We got home and smoked it, and then we went to McDonald’s (lol), and my cousin waited in the car (yes bad I know) while we went inside. She sent a text to her boyfriend and he started laughing hysterically, he showed me the text and she had said “I can’t feel my teeth”. Anyways it was a whole adventure and we had a good time.

Eventually, our lease was ending and we all had to move. My cousin and her boyfriend wanted to move out on their own. I ended up moving in with someone I was dating at the time. Funny enough, after this, my cousin and her boyfriend started being regular stoners. I would go visit at their new apartment and they were always vaping.

While I lived with this person I was seeing, some of his friends from school, a girl and a guy, and the girls boyfriend and his friend ended up living with us. The two of them were potheads, and so once again I smoked with them occasionally.

Eventually, this person I was seeing revealed to me that he was working at a bathhouse... he took me there one night to meet his boss who I guess he was good friends with, a man who was probably in his 40’s (I was about 20). This is where everything went downhill. We went down to his office in the basement of this bathhouse, I was so infatuated with this person that I allowed myself to make a series of bad choices in relation to him, I guess I felt very safe with him (at first). All of a sudden his boss takes out some plastic straws. Next thing I know there is cocaine on the table, something I’ve never done in my life. Yet for some reason I did it with them. At this time I no longer worked at Futureshop because the company went under and all of them converted to Best Buy. I desperately needed a job. In my coked out state, this guy showed me a tour of this bathhouse, something that would typically repulse me and was so far out of my wheelhouse of life experience and interest. As he was showing me these rooms where people go to have sex, a steam room, laundry room, etc., he told me you would be cleaning rooms, giving people towels etc. He said “you can start tomorrow” and I accepted on the spot...

From here my life turned into two years of hell. I worked here 5 days a week, often overnight. People overdosed in this place, tried to sexually assault me, threatened me with violence, did drugs and screamed slapping themselves in their rooms while I sat in the office (luckily with bars on the windows) playing my 3DS like a child with a much older guy that I often worked with, his name was Mike.

Mike was a big pothead. Every overnight I worked with him, he would go and roll a joint in the bathroom and then we would go outside and smoke it and just put a “be right back” sign up. Sometimes customers (I guess you can call them that? They rented rooms and lockers) would also come out and smoke with us. This became the only thing I looked forward to, those moments when Mike would roll a joint I would get so excited. Looking back I think I was just excited to numb myself. I remember walking those halls every day and thinking “I will never get out of here. My life will never get better.” I worked there for 2 years, only staying because I felt that my working there had decreased my value entirely as a person and I would never be able to leave. I experienced so many awful things there and was very suicidal. Someone once said to me through the bars “you look like you’d be worth the rape charge.”

Fast forward, I broke up with this person while we were still living together because he was messaging people for sex behind my back and I saw it on his phone in a text while he was sitting beside me. Now I needed somewhere new to live because I was in a constant state of suffering with him bringing people over and sleeping with them while my bedroom was right next to his.

Eventually through my weed dealer (whom I met through someone at the bathhouse) I asked for some magic mushrooms. I did them one night at home, and played Far Cry 3 alone in my room. I remember hearing the front door open and voices. I strained to hear what was going on and felt like a deer in the headlights, as I knew that my now ex had brought someone home. They went into his bedroom and I knew action had to be taken so I wouldn’t suffer. I called my best friend (who I had known since Grade 6) and asked him to come over. We played Kirby Canvas Curse on Wii U I vividly remember lol... Suddenly an epiphany hit me, and I realized I needed to get out RIGHT NOW. I asked my friend, please let me go to your university with you tonight, I have to leave. Of course he obliged and we left.

That night I messaged a friend of mine (the girl and her boyfriend who had lived with me and my now ex, they now lived on their own) and I told her basically “Hey, I never ask for help from anyone in my life, but can I please move in with you for now.” Obviously I said more but that was the idea. She said yes of course.

I lived with them for a while, and eventually found a girl on Facebook I went to high school with but did not know well, was looking  for a roommate. I went to see her and look at the place and ended up moving in with her.

She was a MAJOR pothead. High all day every day from morning till night. Wake and bake.i would go in her room and smoke a hookah/vape thing with her, and this was the first time I started using a bong which she had. This is when my habit went full force. For the first time I was buying weed on my own. I was hitting the bong every day. Everything I did I did high. Eventually she went on a trip to Thailand for two months, I had quit the bathhouse and didn’t have a job. Finally I found a “normal” job at a Liquor Depot. I got hired on the spot.

A lot of my problems with weed seemed to be work related. I would go to work and feel constantly on the edge of getting into confrontations with difficult customers. I always felt on the edge. I would get into these moments where I would be looking at a customer at the till and feel like a deer in the headlights, like I had done something wrong, they were angry with me, and I would be defensive. All the time.
Sometimes, quite often actually, when people would make what I perceived to be passive aggressive comments or be rude to me I would straight up call it out, my irritation and fear would leak out of me. I was in a state of fearfulness that people could see that tension in my face and I felt like people were trying to draw it out of me.

One day I had a total panic attack at work and my manager had to close the store and take me to the hospital in a taxi because I couldn’t breathe. From here I told them how I felt at work like a deer in the headlights, and I ended up being scheduled to meet with a therapist. Through this therapist I met a psychologist and I was put on the antidepressant Zoloft.

Over this period of time I have taken small breaks from weed. One year over Christmas, I went to my moms and hadn’t had any for about 10 days. I had a literal spazz attack in the vehicle one day with my mom and slammed my hands on the seat and screamed at the top of my lungs, I guess because I was just filled with angst and irritation? My mom was shocked. She had never seen me like that before. We went to my grandmas for Christmas like every year and for the first time my mom suggested that maybe I was feeling this way because I haven’t been having weed. She admitted to me she didn’t think I was on a good path. This was the first time I ever had self awareness brought to how weed wasn’t a positive influence on me.

Since then I had tried to quit multiple times. Each time I felt so much better and began feeling normal and like my old self, but I was always surrounded by people and my roommate who smoked. When I would express how much better I feel in a sober state, it was met with rejection by my roommate and annoyance in a subtle way.

Anyways, skip to the present day. I now live on my own, and I’m unemployed. I went through a lot of abuse at the liquor store and my manager outright mocked my mental health based on her knowledge that I took antidepressants. I was regularly threatened and dealt with a lot of shit, and I think I only stayed because weed kept me too number out to leave. One day I ended up walking out on a shift after I had stopped smoking for a while. I guess not smoking brings me clarity.

Of course living alone with no job and my family being disappointed in me, no one having faith in me (my grandma telling me frequently, “what happened to all of your hopes and dreams, you had so many plans, what a waste, what a waste of talent”) I continued smoking weed. This past summer I went to my aunties wedding. My other auntie was there and her and her husband took me aside and told me “we want to support you, we want to help you find your passion in life, if you need anything, $1000 bucks, just let me know”. They told me I could move to Vancouver Island with them.

Now I had no job and was still smoking, wasting money I didn’t have on weed. Buying prerolls in a false attempt not to buy packages of weed which would prolong my smoking for weeks, my false logic lead me to believe that was the way to go, and instead I was going and spending $10-$14 on prerolls pretty much every day.

Eventually I couldn’t afford rent, this was in September. I spent a week at my moms place. She didn’t know what I was going you do. I told her about my aunties offer. She told me every day that week, “you’ve gotta message her, you know she would help you, she offered it to you”. I spent that whole week avoiding it, putting off the idea of my rent, buying weed and smoking it at my moms... eventually at the end of the week I caved and I messaged her, I asked if she could help pay my rent and I would come up with a payment plan when I’m back on my feet. Of course she obliged.

Now it’s Decemeber. I managed to get onto employment insurance. My rent is secured but I still don’t have a job. I had quit smoking weed for a period of time and went for another visit to my moms and her fiancée. I spent a great week there sober. At the end of the week, the last day I was there, her fiancée wanted to bring home some drinks, perhaps because it was my last day there. We have a history and he has been very rude to my mom in the past, they would have many drunk fights in the past, I had heard he had thrown a glass of water in her face one night, and another night when I lived with my ex he had come over with my mom and we had drinks, and he suspected my mom of cheating for no reason and called her a whore, I told him to get out of my apartment and he took my moms car drunk, came back and we met him outside and him and I had a physical fight.

So anyways, back to where I was, I said I didn’t want to drink this night. They were sitting at the kitchen table and I was in the living room playing Nintendo Switch. Her fiancée made a drink and handed it to me anyways. For some reason I took it anyways and just said “you’re bad” and drank it. Then I started drinking. For some reason all my emotions came out this night and I ended up freaking out and saying “I didn’t come here to listen to your fucking 80’s youth music”. I said this to my mom, I guess because I felt ignored and neglected. I said I didn’t come here to be dismissed. He admitted “yeah I’ve been dismissive”. We ended up all getting into an argument, her fiancée told me “you use and take advantage of your mom, I see it, your grandparents see it, everyone sees it”. I sat across from him and I was just staring at him, seething. He said “don’t you fucking look at me like that” my mom told us “why are you guys just staring at each other, stop it’s childish”. I think she clearly didn’t want things to go bad. He said “this is what men do.” Then he said to me “You think you’re a big man?” And I just said “yes I do.” Anyways all of these old emotions came out and the night was a disaster. I ended up yelling saying “I don’t need your fucking help, if this is the price don’t ask me how I’m doing, don’t ask me what’s going on, stop helping me, leave me alone” basically. Things calmed down by the end of the night and my mom went to bed and said “I can’t do this I have to work in the morning.” I stayed up with him a while and for some reason broke down crying about how I was molested as a kid and how it fucked me up. Just a weird crazy night. He asked why do I have to go home tomorrow, I gave whatever reason. I woke up the next day and felt so horrible, my emotions were so bad. All I could think about was how he said I take advantage of my mom. I woke up and was alone in the house, my mom had wanted me to go see her at work at lunch to say goodbye. Instead I got in the car, started driving back home to the city (3 hours away). I saw a text from her on my phone that said “please stay another night” and I broke down crying, thinking “I have to separate myself from my family, I can’t handle this lack of faith in me and disrespect and all of this stuff.” The idea of it made me break down, I just wished my mom wasn’t with him so I could just get to the real issues with her.

So here I am now, I had told my mom I am not coming for Christmas, I don’t want to be around people who don’t respect me and have no faith in me. I don’t think she believes that I will do that. But I really don’t want to spend another Christmas with this guy who insulted me so painfully saying I take advantage of my mom, and my grandparents who I guess feel the same and think I’m a waste.

The main point of this post is for me to write this all out, because now I can see how much damage weed has done to me, how many years I’ve wasted now. I’m 25. I’m unemployed and now my heart is so confused about what I should do for Christmas. I know I will absolutely break my mother’s heart if I go, but at the same time I know she won’t take seriously what I’m feeling unless I follow through. I have been sober from weed for 12 days now. I feel incredible. I feel motivated, everything is different in so many ways. Now I feel finally motivated to get a job and work on my resume, the only thing that has held me back is the fear of how to include this terrible embarrassing job I had for two years on my resume, I think I’ve been smoking weed while unemployed simply to numb myself from the responsibility of this. I am now hoping my sober mind can find a way through this challenge, as well as the Christmas challenge.

I exercise everyday. Always have even while smoking. I get up and run 10k before work every day and then do yoga/stretch for a half hour, so I'm not lacking exercise. In the evening I crave sugar and salt and just eat and eat. I got munchies when I smoked weed but nothing like this. Embarrassingly enough I actually puked last night because I had eaten like 5 chocolate bars, probably 10 litres of popcorn and an entire bag of spitz
Anyone else not be able to stop eating when they quit or is it just me? I feel like I have no control. I'm not overweight or anything. I have tons of hobbies but in the evening I have trouble sleeping so I try not to stimulate my brain with hobbies for the last couple hours. Apparently I read a book and eat my life away. 
Other times I quit weed I kept smoking tobacco and had no appetite at all, so it must be from quitting cigarettes.?

I went through a lot of traumatic stuff the past couple months and I noticed that weed was starting to exacerbate my anxiety when I would smoke. It came to a head on Monday morning when I was getting ready for an interview. I was totally fine, and then about 25 minutes after I smoked fell into a heavy panic attack. I couldn't tell if it was the weed or my situation so I tried again later that evening, and it happened again. 

So, as of today, I'm just shy of 72 hours being sober. I haven't gone a single day without smoking (multiple times daily) since 2011. 

The nauseousness and lack of appetite I think may be the worst part because it's feeding my anxiety without having nutrients in my body. Trying to stay busy and focus but wondering if this feeling will ever pass.

I've always had mild anxiety, and when I started smoking weed as a teen it helped. But I think over the past couple years I was just smoking to put off withdrawing. The panic attacks on Monday were so bad I went cold turkey. 

I was just wondering if anyone had similar experiences, or any words of advice. Will my brain eventually level out? It's so weird being sober it's almost like it's another type of high.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988054037094116}"

But last night I decided to let myself go because I got a lot of work done and finals don’t actually start for a week and I just realized I flew too close to the sun and need to be careful when I drink especially. Towards the end of my weed journey it usually just consisted of full bowl chops (weed + cigarette in a bowl) that put me down for a couple minutes then nicely lead into the shitshow that was me getting high.

Last night though after a couple drinks I was in my friends room and I ended up doing two T bowls, after realizing that I smoked anything again I quickly made the decision it was time for me to go to bed before I continued to justify any more of my behavior.

Weed was not what we previously thought it to be. Initially, I was a little scared of weed. It always seemed to make me anxious at strange moments, but I could always control it. Eventually, I got suspended from high school for weed, and my teachers and peers never really looked at me the same way. It was weird, nothing about me was different, but their eyes became suddenly malevolent and disgusted in a way. My parents also were very upset at me. Personally, I felt a little ""other""-ed but I understood that its simply their lack of information on the subject. The word marijuana, weed, cannabis, tends to illicit very negative feelings from people. Even its smell. As a heavy stoner, I know the foolishness of that impression and have an appreciation for Weeds fine aroma, but all this shows that non-smokers judge people if they smoke weed badly on an unconscious level from misinformation and bad experiences. I am in University now and have been a heavy smoker for the past year. I have had various viewpoints on Marijuana and its place in my life, but overall, I have realized that it is holding me back and squishing my potential. Even though I am doing well in school and in my classes, I have zero social life. I have friends - yes, but I don't want to spend time with them. I think they aren't the most interesting people in the world, but since I am avoiding them being stoned, I am avoiding the opportunity of meeting new friends through natural in-person interactions. I have also spent soo much time isolated. Before coming to university I was living an isolated life anyways, but I had lot of energy for hobbies and activities with friends, but now, I avoid going out.

&#x200B;

The biggest problem I think is that weed has suppressed my personality. We never dream when we smoke weed. Did you know that dreaming is very important? Many psychoanalysts like Carl Jung argue that in dreams you can find many solutions to your daily and life problems and ways to grow, or complete, your personality. I haven't had a proper dream in a year, and before I used to Lucid dream. I would have very vivid dreams and these would sometimes clear my soul - in a sense. Additionally, I don't know who I am trying to portray in social situations. I think this is a rare problem, but I feel like Ive relied on weed for so long I don't know what things I would be doing and wanting to do without it. I always feel like my life lacks so many things, it lacks meaningful friends, deep loving relationships, more intellectual stimulation, exploration, adventure, etc. but once I quit smoking weed, I feel kinda shitty and then once the withdrawal symptoms are gone, I just feel hollow. 

&#x200B;

The ultimate problem is this - I don't know what to do with myself without weed.

Lots of chronic abuse.,"Please don't make fun of me for this. This is not a parody. This is serious. I've been heavily addicted to weed for 2 month now, and I need to snap out of it ASAP and quit weed entirely.

I've been using weed consistently for 2 years, it started off light, and progressively got heavier until today. I really want to stop, but I really don't know how. I just turned 20. I seem to have some sort of dependency/addiction to it, but I can't figure out where it's rooted from if not physical and why I constantly give in to it. I don't know how to snap out it.

I've always smoked weed akin to why I would drink a coffee; which is strictly for the dopamine boost. It's not really because of deeper underlying issues AFAIKT. At first I could manage it, but progressively it got worst.

But recently, it got to the point of me toking daily. Then it got to me toking all the time when I'm home, and I don't leave my home. I haven't socialized in weeks and my university grades are plummeting if I don't remedy my own problem asap.

When I'm high, I feel great, but all I can think about is quitting weed. When I'm sober, it's like I'm a whole new person who forgot how the weed experience was, and I start wondering what getting high is like sober. And so I give into the urge of finding weed and smoking it as a precursor to doing anything productive, and those productive things \*\*Never\*\* get done. Now, I even start my mornings off with weed. I've tried to stop, but I just give into the urge when I wake up.

Three of my impeding characteristics are that I'm a very intelligent and simultaneously very creative kid, all the while quite stubborn; both with myself and others. As a result of these three traits,

a. When I'm sober, I'm too stubborn to admit to myself I have a  problem with weed. My ego would genuinely take offence to the connotation of being associated with resembling a pothead. I'm not a pothead, I believe.

b. Every time I wake up seems like a reset switch for my feelings towards weed. I proceed to give in and smoke immediately because my creative brain creates a bullshit yet valid logical justification for my brain advocating for why I should smoke at that moment. My brain gives in by impulse. I seem to have developed impulse control issues with weed.

c. when craving my creative brain always runs through every viable possibility of finding weed, and I just do it. Anything from a friend to a dispensary, to scraping off crumbs off from under my desk.

d. I always find a way to smoke it, no matter how lacking on supplies. i've invented several wacky bong-like contraptions out of random objects in my closet just so i can smoke.

I need a plan to quit immediately \*\*on my own\*\*. This is the first time I've formally opened up to anyone about this, or even myself.  They say weed is not addictive, but I'm addicted. I need some way to break this habit, or have something I can do IMMEDIATELY to relieve the urge of me toking. I'm trying to start tomorrow fresh ASAP, and quit/take a LONG t-break. ( I've been trying to avoid the urge to smoke when I wake up for 10 days now to no avail. )  Please advise.

Since I smoked weed the longest (7 years) (3 years daily) I decided here will do.,"I needed to get used to the idea that nothing can make me whole. No substance, no moderation of anything can ever make me feel something anymore. When addicts come to the realization that they can’t ever have another substance again, it kinda scares them. So, what do we addicts do? We try to resist it. We try to do everything in our power to make sure that we can still have a little bit of fun. We try exercising (barely), eating right (for a little while), we try cutting out the alcohol by consuming on weekends only, or we cut out alcohol fully and justify smoking weed by stating “hey well it’s not like I was doing any stupid shit like I was doing while black out drunk.” We try doing all this shit so we can hold onto the idea that we can and we will be able to get fucked up again AND still be able to live a fulfilling life. This is where I had it all wrong. 2019 was a wake up year for me. I quit a bunch of substances and replaced them with others. I tried quitting a bunch of shit, only to go back to that shit I quit and decided to quit something else. I failed to realize that I never needed any of these substances. I never need caffeine. I never needed alcohol. I never needed pornography. I never needed weed. I never needed to browse mindlessly on the internet as a distraction.

On top of all this, I still really want a toke. If I smell it, my mouth starts to water. I feel like I'm just denying myself all the time. If I have a really stressful day, like yesterday, instead of smoking I get drunk as fuck.

Sunday I smoked what needs to be the last gram of cannabis I will smoke in my life. I am almost 35 and for half of my life I have been a daily smoker. Throughout this time I have lost out on many opportunities to develop myself and worse, multiple relationships and friendships. I want to make something more of my life and that time needs to start now or it might never come.

The direct cause for me to take this step now has been due to my fiancé packing her bags after another fight and leaving for good three weeks ago. She never had an issue with my smoking and she never mentioned it as a cause for the breakup but all the reasons she left me for I know were largely caused by my addiction to weed. I am not quitting to get her back (due to circumstances this is basically impossible) but after two weeks drowning my sorrow in the cloud I realized that I will never have a working relationship if I don't stop now. While there was alot more to the relationship than me screwing it up by getting high all the time (she has a heavy childhood trauma which has resulted in Cluster A, B and C personality disorders with diverging severity), I can't deny that many of her arguments for breaking up with me (in the past 6 months she packed her bags and wanted to move out almost 15 times) are down to the effects the cannabis and the addiction had on me. Anger, loud and short-tempered disagreements, morning crankiness, selfishness, self-absorbed, stinginess and laziness are not elements I want to introduce into another relationship again. 

It's not my first time quitting and in the past I have tried with varying results, the longest I was off it being after my first breakup of a 6 year relationship (with an alcoholic who is still struggling with her addiction to this day). Was free of it for 3 months until I made the mistake thinking one joint wouldn't hurt and maybe I could find a healthier balance with it. But I can't. Every time I light up again it does not take long before the habit to consume my life again. 

I want to have a healthy committed and lasting relationship. I might still want to have children some day. I want to have hobbies where I don't loose focus after an hour and thus hardly get anything done. I want to live a life where I don't need something external to feel happy and relaxed. 

I know I have the strength to pull through, now it's just a matter of dedication and commitment. She was not able to commit to me in love so now I have to start a healthier commitment to myself.

I'm really hoping for some feedback,"So I'm at a treatment center for 30 days here in California for years of alcohol and drug use but one of the main reasons I'm here is that I have been smoking pot everyday since I was 13, I am now 37. 

There was one week I didn't smoke pot when I went to Indonesia a couple years ago, but drink heavily of course, and when I was 15 I went to outward bound and didn't smoke for 3 weeks.

Otherwise, I have smoked pot daily without exception for 26 years until November 11th, so coming on 22 days now. 

The doctors and therapists here have told me that it's very common to be angry and a lot of the other side effects I'm having etc... but the one thing is that I have been profusely sweating during the day and especially throughout the night. I have quit alcohol many times in my life in the past but there is nothing that I've changed, medication wise, or any other variables other than quitting smoking pot.

I'm feeling good and extremely proud of myself. The vivid dreams are really weird and certainly not something I'm shying away from per se but the night sweats are killing me. I'm wondering if anybody's had them last for more than a day or two like tends to be the case for me when coming off of alcohol.

The doctors here have no opinion or clue and are trying to test me for other things in regards to my night sweats... I did a full STD panel today and will get results soon to rule anyting out. They are grasping at straws clearly, fingers crossed of course.

Any insight into this? Opinions thoughts or puns LOL

I first started smoking heavily earlier this year. I've always been an anxious person, and while at college, I'm sure you all know that weed is everywhere. Of course, I tried it, and the effects were a revelation. I would smoke and magically feel like a normal person; no inhibitions, no self-consciousness. Pretty soon, I was hooked. 

Fast forward three months, and my brother attempts suicide. Anxiety peaks through the roof along with depression, which I'd never felt before. So naturally, I fall deeper into weed. It was an escape. But I only mention all that to give the backstory. Fast forward again to last week - my anxiety was still terrible, and I knew I needed to change. I knew weed was a crutch, but she's such a sweet temptation. It's hard to say no. I quit a little over a week ago, and the PAWS and general withdrawal symptoms have been hell. But this evening, I was feeling pretty good and anxiety free. I was folding some laundry, listening to music, and for the first time since my smoking became a crutch, I heard a song that gave me a feeling of euphoria that I hadn't felt in a very long time. (Ashes to Ashes, David Bowie for anybody looking for some sweet sweet tunes). 

This post now feels kinda longwinded and rambling, but I just wanted to let everybody know that you WILL feel better and you WILL find joy again like you did before weed. I guess I just wanted to share my excitement with you all and hopefully inspire other people feeling hopeless to push through any doubts ya'll might have. Music has always been a big part of my life, and weed eventually took that joy away from me when I became a smoke-dependent zombie.

I also moved out and got my own place, which is unreal, I've been meaning to do so for quite some time. Hm, I also quit drinking 23 days ago, because the reason I reset 23 days ago is because I got drunk and smoked a joint and it pretty much caused me to have a psychotic episode while I was wandering a bad part of town after I left a friends at 7 am.

I want more out of my life. I’m about to turn 30, and I feel like it’s time to grow up. I’ve been smoking daily for the last 6+ years. I’ve had a lot of ups and down during that time, including mental health struggles and battling an eating disorder. I got high through all of it, and somehow actually got better. I’ve been relatively stable the last couple years. This summer, I left the family business and got a big girl job all on own. I’m working full time for the first time in my adult life.

I’m starting to bottle up a lot of feelings, and I don’t know how to deal with everything. Which is why I turn to weed. Literally every day.

This community and a great many of you have made this painful, but necessary journey possible; from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
For those looking to quit; know that to get to Heaven you will need to trek through Hell. You will get there though. The “old” or “new” you will persevere in time because you are greater than the addiction.
I am a professional who makes good money, but weed has taken much mental ability and fortitude from me. After 6 months, I am seeing marked improvement and am hoping even more in the future. If I had to pinpoint the greatest deficit still, I would say word recall.
Having said that, the benefits are so plentiful that naming them all would be a chore unto itself.

I'm starting to think that that's one of the biggest reasons I was dependent on weed. I have these nagging worries going on the back of my head. Today, I had this feeling all day that my Dad doesn't like the person I've grown up to be and is hiding it. I couldn't stop thinking about it all day.

In the past, I would just fight with myself about it. I would think ""you should stop worrying about that. You're being insecure and unreasonable so what you're feeling is illogical and thus invalid"" (or something along those lines that's much less cohesive).

And then I'd get high, of course, and distract myself from the anxiety temporarily until I was sober and started worrying again.

And that cycle would continue over and over again. For the past 8 years that's how I'd deal with anxiety.

But when you're sober, you can't get away from the anxiety. You have no choice but to either find away to alleviate it or spiral until you're in a pit

But I realized today that before you find away to work through the feelings you're having, you have to accept them and validate them as real, you know. 

Like, it doesn't matter how ""unrealistic"" or ""illogical"" your fear is. It really really doesn't matter. You're not stupid for having negative feelings. You're not wrong for feeling insecure. Negative emotions like fear, or anxiety, or anger all exist in this same space as the positive feelings. They're just as valid as whatever else you're capable of feeling. 

Of course I would like to feel positive all the time. But I'm just a fuckin biological creature man. Humans are just animals. I don't get to choose how I interpret reality. I just feel what I feel based off of the experiences I've had that have led me to this point, and I have to work with what I've got and move forward and grow from whatever that may be.

Basically, **IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT FOR FEELING HOW YOU FEEL.**

So I had to accept that yes, I'm genuinely worried about how my dad feels about me. Once I accepted that feeling as valid, I was able to start thinking of ways that I could solve it. I could try to reach out more to him. I could ask him how he feels more. I could share more about myself to him and try to be a positive influence in his life. I could sit down with and ask ""Hey, are we ok? Is there anything you're angry with me about?

The amazing thing about accepting my anxiety as a valid feeling is that **it inspired me to be a better person and a better son. Letting myself validate my negative feelings turned those negative feelings into a positive ones.**

Firstly, I just wanted to thank everyone on here for the support and congratulate everyones progress. 

So, I feel like I've been making steady progress, up until yesterday (the 14th day).
These past two days I've been extremely fatigued. Today especially, my body feels heavy, my muscles are sore, my mood has dropped, and I've lost my appetite all over again (to the point of nausea). I feel very spaced out (and dizzy) and my body feels stoned. 

I do struggle with mental illness and I can't work out if this is just delayed withdrawal symptoms or if I'm experiencing a bout anxiety and depression. 

Has anyone else had this experience? It's such a bummer, because I thought I had passed the hardest part. 

I almost feel as though I'm coming down with the flu. 

The whole ordeal is making me very anxious. 

I should mention that I have been keeping hydrated, have been going to the gym regularly (cardio), going to work, using the sauna and taking vitamins.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985705614089966}"
2019-12-03 19:37:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e5qt30/day_30_update/,Day 30 Update!,"Hey there everyone happy holidays! I just wanted to update you guys and let you know I officially have made it to a full month sober (36 days to be exact) and I wanted to share a few things I've noticed and the changes I've gone through. I'll try and keep this as short as I can!

I can confidently say that 95% of my physical withdrawal symptoms are gone, I'm sleeping great and that's back to normal. No night sweats, appetite is back to normal and I'm eating fine, no nausea, not feeling lightheaded anymore, no more brain fog. Thinking back I didn't have a ton of physical withdrawal symptoms that I can remember but again pretty much everything is back to normal which I'm very happy about. Very little to no cravings to smoke either which is nice, honestly I'm too scared to even take 1 hit so I'm also happy the cravings aren't a worry.

Mentally I would say I'm still struggling and is the biggest issue over physical withdrawals, but I'm doing better than I was the first few weeks of quitting. What I've been experiencing is anxiety, depression and loneliness (I've been battling anxiety and depression for 9 years) My anxiety being the worst of the three, and it's been through some weird stages. It started off with 24/7 anxiety, then shifted to anxiety bouts through the day with the lump in the throat feeling and breathing difficulty when my anxiety would come on. For a while ingesting a lot of sugar/caffeine would trigger my anxiety so I swapped to decaf coffee and laid back on soda, so that has helped. My anxiety now is sitting at basically coming on before bed at night with the shortness of breath feeling which really isn't fun. My psychiatrist prescribed me 25mg hydroxzyine which helps a lot, whenever I feel like I can't calm my anxiety myself I take that and in 30 mins I'm relaxed and I'm feeling okay which is a savior. I'm not going to become reliant on that and I don't take it daily, just for emergencies. I'm scared to go back on a daily SSRI for my anxiety, so I'm trying coping mechanisms and breathing methods, going to look into meditation apps, working out too. I want to attempt to battle this shit anxiety myself, which is a hard battle in itself but I'm trying. Basically I'm just sitting at being more sensitive emotionally than I was before I quit, getting lonely if no one is home or missing my gf a lot since I don't see her much during the week, etc. Going on walks and starting a new workout routine lately has helped and is a great distraction from all this mental crap, so I'm sticking with that for sure.

Sorry if that turned into a longer read than I wanted but overall I'm happy I've made it this far, I have recovered a lot since quitting and basically the mental battle is my main problem I have to face from here on out. I'm very excited to end 2019 sober with a clearer mind, healthier state of my body and looking forward to a sober 2020 :) I hope you guys are hanging in there and taking care of yourselves and hope the end of your years are great and sober too!",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5375002026557922}"

Was it easy to quit NO! I went through a tough detox and had every symptom of Marijuana withdraw syndrome known to man.  I'm currently dealing with moderate PAWS.  I have been reading a lot of post where people relapse over stress, bad days, PAWS, rewarding one's self, lost jobs, smoking in moderation, friends, and so on.

Why do you want to torture yourself again and again go through detox/PAWS over again?   You don't have to live that way anymore.  Once you quit live by this motto ""if I take one hit my sobriety is over"" and stay clean!  The weed today causes addiction because of all the hybrid cross breading. This sounds good till you realize its a double dose of misery!  The vape pens don't even get me started on that seen way too many people getting sick, vomiting, and close to death!

Once you make the decision to quit stick with it and don't give in to Mary's evil ways! Addiction causes us to lie to ourselves to smoke again for what ever reason you want to believe!  Life today for me is so much better but you must accept there will be some tough days to get through! My worst day sober still beats my best day high so far.  Biggest lesson I can tell you is be grateful for the good things in your life and don't dwell on the negativity.  

Quitting weed is a major lifestyle change. This is different for everybody. For those who say they can't quit why? You can quit anytime you want!

I (28F) deal with chronic depression and I’ve been a daily pot smoker for years. I’m tired of it. The amount of pot I have to smoke to get high anymore is ridiculous and it honestly doesn’t do much except keep me from doing things on my to-do list, which prolongs my anxiety. And then nothing gets done

I ran out of pot last night and I didn’t buy more. This is my first morning not smoking in a long time.

I managed to quit for 3 weeks last winter and after like 10 days of emotional fragility and terrible nausea, I actually felt awesome - way less socially anxious, more confident, more outgoing, I could achieve more at the gym, I was way more productive.

But this first week. It’s fucking hard. I can already feel something welling up inside of me, some kind of grief and desperation. Physical discomfort. When you’ve been using pot to push down all your feelings - my sexual trauma, my feelings of inadequacy, my permeating anxiety -  when you stop smoking, they all come geysering up.

I think I failed last time because I didn’t have a wide enough support network. No one except my partner at the time really cared if I was successful or not - it’s just pot, right?

2019-12-03 05:44:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e5feux/almost_off_probation/,Almost off probation,"I've been a marijuana addict on and off for the last 12 years. Every time, it gets to the point where I eventually hit a brick wall, whether that is jail or a psychiatric hold. I was even conserved for a while because I was so insane from heavy use. Also I have a couple of other issues that I was not keeping under control through medication so that compounded the problem.

I get off probation next month, and all my charges will be withdrawn and dismissed. I don't want to share too much, I'll just say I was in a diversion program which I am very very grateful to have been let into. My max for my crimes, which largely centered around hitting a guy for delusional, drug-brain reasons, was over 5 years.  I have never cheated on this probation, not a toke and not a single sip of alcohol. 

This diversion program is pretty liberal in that it wants to treat the whole person, not just see us as criminals. So for this I have to regularly go see a psychiatrist, regularly see a psychologist, go to AA/NA meetings, and very regularly drug test on random days. The program has changed my life. If I had ended up in prison it would have been all bad for everyone. I'm an addict, not a gang member or master criminal. This does not mean I am better than anyone, because I'm not. I'm just saying that I wouldn't have people who knew me and would take care of me in there. 

If I had not been accepted for this diversion, without an absolute doubt I would have remained an addict. I don't know if I would have bought weed in prison. I hear it's priced astronomically but addicts always find a way. Long story short, I would have learned nothing.

Because of my deep gratitude for this program, I did a few things differently this time than the previous times I was on probation. I did an 8 week intensive outpatient program, and I was actually honest every day about exactly how I was thinking and exactly what I was feeling. I was lucky to be in a great group and a lot of us shared some intimate stuff, such as bad memories that have led to us using in the first place, and I know our honesty with each other brought out the best in us. I also did a 6 week co-occurring program after that since I have diagnosed mental illnesses, so just making sure I've got it straight to stay on my prescribed meds and not try to self-medicate. I consider the corollary to self-medication to be proper medication.

I have also been honest with my psychiatrist and with my psychologist. Not only do I get off probation next month but I'll also be getting my 2 years clean. This is the first time in 12 years that I have taken full responsibility for my behaviors and actions, and made it my mission to stay clean and sober. I have way too much to lose, like my house, my family, my finances, etc. Just about every day I talk to another human being about exactly why I want to stay clean. Things like family, coffee, pizza, having my own bedroom that I can make dark and quiet, having my own bathroom, having a shower that shoots out hot water at good pressure, and the list goes on and on.

I like lurking and reading posts in this sub, and I hope that everyone draws strength for each other. And not every day is going to be 100% happy as can be. I was weak before and if I was in a bad mood I'd use that to smoke and say that I was treating my depression. Nowadays sometimes I don't have a solution right away to a problem, but, in jail slang, that's a heart check. As long as my heart's in the right place then I'll fight to keep clean and make progress at every opportunity until that issue is under wraps.

I made it 6 weeks and yes I was feeling good, seeing real progress and improvement in my sociability, memory, cognitive function, etc. I was relearning how to have fun without weed again. I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Then one day I woke up in a horrible depression, had an actual physical sensation like a thousand pounds were weighing my body down. Stayed in bed half the day on the verge of tears; crazy thing is there was absolutely nothing in my life to cause those feelings, I think it must have been PAWS. Brain chemistry’s a bitch, eh? I’m praying I don’t have actual depression because I have so many reservations about trying anti-depressants. 

So after half the day spent in misery I caved and thought what harm could one edible do? I just wanted those feelings to stop, I would have done anything. Well the edible led to a 2-week bender. Sobered up for about a week and a half after that, relapsed again and went on a 1-week bender, and now here I am with 1 week sober under my belt again. I don’t know if what I felt at the 6-week mark was normal PAWS or if it was depression surfacing since I was no longer self-medicating. How many times do I have to go through these cycles before I try a therapist and/or anti-depressants? I don’t know. I’m scared of the pills. So many side effects, and I don’t want that for the rest of my life.

On the bright side, after staying 6 weeks sober, my withdrawal symptoms after my past 2 benders were very mild compared to the first time I tried quitting. None of my thoughts about weed have changed. If anything, this relapse period has reinforced my conviction that I need to quit and that it is ultimately a purely negative influence on my life. So here I am again, 7 days in. I suppose the problem is I don’t know what I am going to do if those feelings pop up again (and I’m sure they will). I guess I have to remind myself that a bit of relief will lead me on a downward spiral like it always does, and just suffer through it and pray those 6-week symptoms are not permanent or long-lasting. But man it was intense, I don’t know if I can handle what I felt at the 6-week mark for more than one day. Hell I couldn’t even handle it for half a day last time.

I’m now six months clean and feel so much more human as a result. I’ve come to learn that there’s no cure for the heaviness that can afflict even the most idyllic of life experiences, but showing up in my relationships and community as I am has been so rewarding.

It drains me financially. No focus. No energy. Man I even forget about my brother's and sister's birthday. Before I go do anything, I roll one. It has become my #1 priority to make sure that I'm able to smoke one before bed. I've took my last hit last evening. Today I will quit this bad habit. 

Over the last 8 years I've been smoking weed daily to full-time, I'm 26 years old now. It has become my most conditioned habit, together with smoking cigarettes. I've been realising for a long time now that it is the right decision to stop smoking weed all together. I've tried to quit a couple of times, sometimes reaching 40 days, sometimes not even the end of the first day. It's worrisome that someone's trying to quit something he really doesn't want to do anymore, but simply can't. 

I'm confident this time will be different though. I've committed together with my girlfriend now, and together we're stronger. I also feel like I've dragged her into making smoking a daily habit since we started dating. We've been together for almost 3 years now and I'm sure this step will benefit us both greatly. It will be tough, especially in the beginning. But it is a sacrifice we'll make for a healthier and sober life.

So have been sober for almost a year (hopefully forever but I know that it is a pipe dream). I smoked heavily for over 3 years in college. i have noticed that when I stop smoking weed, my memory and attention span improves considerably, and I am a lot less prone to mood swings. But on a serious note, what are the long term effects of marijuana use ? From what I know, Cannabis can contain over 100 different [cannabinoid compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid), many of which have displayed [psychoactive effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug). So long-term cannabis use is indeed strongly associated with Psychosis and Schizophrenia. But these studies are usually seen as controversial by the scientific community because it is said that cannabis ""simply increases the risk of Psychosis in people with certain genetic or environmental vulnerabilities"", but does not actually cause psychosis. As a former heavy smoker, I still get some mild auditory hallucinations (music echoes in mind), but that may be more likely due to other drugs I used like LSD, 2CB, MDMA.

I am an asthmatic. I know there are asthmatics that can smoke and who have little to no issue with their symptoms, but I am not one of them. A good hit will leave me incapacitated for 5 minutes (if not longer) while I try to catch my breath and breathe properly once more.

Deep down, I want to quit. But when I'm sober, deep down, I want to be a functional pothead.

The bottom line is I am not capable of being a functional pothead, not with my circumstances. And that depresses me more than anything in the world.

Fast forward to college. My first year I was keeping up well, but then it became really difficult when external life events happened. My all or nothing thinking was very damaging...

Whatever drove me to be ambitious, patient, and hard-working started fading as I just craved the relief of being high. It's undeniable at this point the place weed has in my life and I want to change that. I want to relearn attributes that used to be apart of me.

When I was 22 is when I had my first episode and let me tell you now, it was immensely bad - it started with me getting up at 3am and going down stairs, I thought that MI5 agents were outside my window ready to shoot me down, I eventually got up from the floor away from imaginary gun fire and I started cutting up all my important cards from my wallet and started making a collage of art with them all all, to this day is still don’t know why I did it, I’m not really artistic in the slightest. 

Around this time I was looking for jobs and I had an interview for a opticians, inside my brain I thought that it was actually  the MI5 from earlier trying to recruit me for specialised hacking despite trying to shoot me earlier. Who would have thought?  I spent days before the interview investigating any mail/ email I got through the post trying to find clues for potential information about my upcoming job interview. I was totally deluded. Flash forward to my interview date my psychotic brain decided that from the clues from mail and emails that I was to be picked up by someone at a precise time at a local gym. I got to the gym and the first car which pulls up I instantly try and get into it.

‘What the fuck are you doing mate?!’ The guy screamed that’s when I decided I’ve been set up and that I needed to go for a walk. So I did, I went for a 4 mile walk all the while being manic and paranoid. So much so that people came up to me asking if I needed help. 

Eventually I got back home and explained to my mum that the government are going to drop bombs on us, that’s when my mum and dad brought me up to the doctors, apparently my doctor said I was going through a psychotic episode and I needed medication. Now because I thought weed was the cure of all diseases and you could only get mentally ill if you had people in your family who had history I declined the antipsychotics the doctor issued me. 

Later on that night I got into such a manic state that I smashed a few mirrors and my mother’s favourite vase, this is when they phoned the police, and that’s when I brandished a knife and started cutting the table. The police came, told me to drop the knife which I did and then handcuffed me and put me inside the police van all the while I was singing Nirvana - come as you are. I was sent to psychiatric hospital and I spent there 28 days under section of the mental health act.

After coming out of hospital I carried on taking my risperidone (antipsychotic) but eventually picked up smoking weed again - in total I’ve been in hospital 3 times, the most recent and worst was in August were I spent almost 2 months in hospital. 

If you’re someone who suffers from bad mental reactions from weed, and/or have a history of becoming unstable please, I beg of you to stay away from cannabis. The hour you get from being high and being away from your worries is not worth the aftermath it can cause to yourself and family members for years to come. Plus being on antipsychotic medication is no fun at all, I hope to be off them one day.

Now I’m 4 months clean from cannabis and I really wish I didn’t have to go through years of mental struggles to come to realise that I needed to stop.",33,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994794726371765}"

2019-12-01 04:20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e4eqbo/how_do_you_all_deal_with_the_boredom/,How do you all deal with the boredom?,"Howdy Y'all,

My story with weed is simple, I have (had maybe, I have read you can grow out of it) ADHD. As a result, things tend to consume me until I grow bored of them. This is typically video games, fiction or my current partner. I become obsessed and just want to do nothing other than the thing I am obsessed about, and in that moment I am truly interested. Maybe interested is the wrong word, but I am completely without boredom. And that is my existence, completely consumed by something, or bored. Even if only a little bored. Bored.

When I first got high, I felt that feeling. Without boredom. However, for the first time it wasn't accompanied by that usual, gripping feeling of obsession that comes with many of my interests. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy that feeling of obsession, but not all the time.

Anywho, fast forward a few years and the sometimes smoker has become an everyday smoker. I don't mean too, but after dinner I am just sitting in my house and I am so very bored. So I just buy some more weed and the problem is solved. The thing is I have been thinking about just not smoking for an evening or two and I start to feel a sense of fear. That feels like addiction. I have never been addicted to anything before, but I guess that it what it is.

Does anyone else know this feeling or have any ideas on how to combat the boredom? Because the main thing I struggle with is that before I started smoking, I still struggled with that boredom. I want to stop smoking because I fear it has a greater grip on me than I think it does, but I fear the boredom more. I don't want it to come back.

Anyone got any thoughts? I don't know if anyone will or not, but this has felt good to write down, so... thanks for reading if nothing else! :-)",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9944658875465393}"
2019-12-01 02:31:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e4d7rf/trouble_sleeping_without_it/,Trouble sleeping without it.,"This ended up getting long and rambly. My original intention was to ask: **how did you deal with sleep issues when quitting?**

I'm 31, been smoking for 12 years - that's 4380 days, I've probably smoked on 4000 of those days. But lately I've been feeling like it's about time to end it. I smoked cigarettes for 4 years and I feel like weed has kinda become like cigarettes were for me - I don't really even get high anymore, smoking just stops my urge to smoke. I can take a tolerance break and within a few days of smoking again it's back to its all time high. My girlfriend and I were wondering how our friends in similar financial situations are able to go on cool vacations a few times a year and we can't... Well I figured it out, they're not spending $5000 a year on weed.

In April of last year I got a good job offer, had to do a mouth swab drug test which was easy to pass by not smoking for a day and using some mouthwash. After a 6 month provisional period I was offered a permanent position for which I had to do a urine sample drug test. I knew about synthetic urine, never planned to quit. Well I fucked up, the synthetic urine was too warm, I failed the test and lost the job. Was that enough motivation to quit? No, I just went back to shitty dead end jobs that I could smoke at without issue.

I've been addicted to and quit other drugs which are supposed to be much more addicting. Smoked cigarettes for 4 years, did meth for a year and a half.

And (for me at least) for the most part, it's not near as hard to go without weed as it was those. Throughout the day I'm fine without it cause I can keep busy with work, lifting, walking the dogs, whatever. I don't *need* weed, I don't crave it, I don't feel like I'm physically addicted. If I get bored I'll want to smoke but it's easy enough to tell myself I don't need it, I'll be fine and I can go about my day.

But it's now 1:14am and I'm wide awake. On any night when I would normally smoke I'd struggle to make it past 11pm. Same happened last night. And shits hella frustrating, I usually sleep pretty well, I like getting up early, getting shit done, I don't remember the last time I felt tired in the middle of a work day. Writing all this feels really whiny now, I quit meth but I can't miss a couple hours of sleep.

I dunno, just frustrated. That I let myself get to this point, didn't make more effort sooner, let it become more important than a career/my future. It doesn't help that my girlfriend has no intention of quitting but I can handle that emotional (?) part of it - it's not like I'm triggered by seeing her smoking or anything, the brain sleep conditioning thing is the only part that's really an issue, but it would be nice if she was at least interested in the idea of maybe quitting someday, it's admittedly frustrating that she doesn't even consider it.
