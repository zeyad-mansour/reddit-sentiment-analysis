But instead i found someone I like and started telling them about my 5.5 month journey. That helped me to feel the gravity of my daily choices and then getting high seemed pretty silly.

I guess I’m feeling sort of down on myself today and could use some encouragement. Even though I have over two years sober (which I am very proud of), I feel like I still have to much to accomplish or improve on in my life. I don’t have a partner nor do I really know how to date sober. I just graduated grad school and don’t have a job yet, let alone a career. I don’t even like my wardrobe for pete’s sake. 

I’m trying to remember that I was way farther behind three years ago than I am today. When I spent most of my day high in bed, nothing was getting done. I was stagnant. Being sober today gives me a chance to work on myself. It gives me the opportunity to make things better. At least there’s some hope. 

If you’re still smoking, just know that it’s never too late to stop. “The perfect time to grow a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”",6,0

6,2021-05-30 21:34:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nopfsc/every_relapse_just_makes_it_worse/,Every relapse just makes it worse,"So I started trying to quit at the start of Feb this year. I've failed many, many times. At the start I could barely do a day. Most recent stretches have been 10-14. So that's progress, I guess.

But I feel worse than ever. At the start, even though I was still using more than not, i was happy, motivated, doing waaay more work and hobbies. Now, i can barely bring myself to play a video game, let alone work or do hobbies or god forbid exercise. It's like, the less I use, the less frequently i use, the worse the withdrawal symptoms get. 

I know the lack of motivation is most likely dopamine-tolerance-related-anhedonia-whatever-it's-called. I know it's a symptom. But it just sucks! I feel like an empty shell of a person, like someone scooped out all my insides and stomped on them. 

And it's getting worse every time. 

My mental health has slid backwards so significantly these past months and I dont know what to do about it or if this is normal or what. 

I have a wonderful, beautiful life and a loving supportive family and a job where I can do what I love on my own schedule. I have every reason to be motivated and happy and energetic and living every day. And all I want to do is sleep and cry and stare blankly at the wall. 

I just want things to start getting better. I thought reducing my use so much would make things get better. But they're just getting worse.

I'm sorry for my pity party, but for some reason writing on here is easier than journaling at the moment. 

TLDR: I've reduce my usage a lot, abstaining for longer and longer. But my mental health is in the toilet. Is it normal for cutting down to make withdrawal symptoms worse and you feel depressed? Or am I just experiencing normal anhedonia and being a whiny bitch about it?

7,2021-05-30 21:08:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nop0kt/checking_in_since_may_2018/,Checking in since May 2018,"Hey all. I was a 17 year smoker that smoked on the regular every 2 hours or so. I was trying to juggle a family, a job, and a raging desire to stay high. For along time I had wanted to quit because of how much money I was spending. I felt trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck, too tired to do anything but get through each day. I felt stuck in my job and like life was passing me by. 

One day in May of 2018, I had a huge fight with my wife and nearly got pulled over right after I smoked while driving around. That was the straw that broke the camels back. I threw all my weed and pipes out and gave away my two bongs. It was tough, but I finally wanted to be done with it more than I wanted to be high. 

One of the few things that kept me from relapsing (...which I did end up smoking a handful of times since then) was working to better myself in some way. I started working out. At one point I realized my work would give me full tuition coverage for my masters degree... so I went back to school at nights and kept away from weed because I was afraid I'd fall off the schoolwork and never get the chance for a free masters when It was over. During this time I was volunteering for some extra duties around new program at work. When I got my masters I was worried that without something to occupy me , I would start smoking again. So I ended up applying for jobs every few nights a week just to keep me busy. Because it was the first time in my life I was job shopping without actually needing one, I took the freedom to turn down a few offers. Eventually one was offered to me that I couldn't turn down. 

I accepted and now I'm making more than double my income. I'm working on a team of very smart, highly educated people with a bright career path ahead of me, in an industry I'm proud of. 

I write this huge wall of text because I wanted everyone to know I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life. At one point when I smoked, I thought there was nothing better than listening to good music when I was stoned. I really thought that I would have little happiness in life if I quit smoking.  In reality, I finally realized that there is no better feeling than putting in long term , hard work to better yourself. Iv never been prouder of myself, im so happy to make my mom proud, I feel like I'm putting forth a good example for my family, etc

I realize this isn't the solution for everyone. I just want to say that I will always be here cheering for everyone. I've said in a few of my replies here that I think the key to quitting long term is to align your daily habits with working on something that will devote your time to making yourself better... school, cooking, art, gym, learning a trade , etc. 

If you're on the fence , do it. I sincerely hope you get to experience the long term, long lasting happiness of having the pride that you did something hard to make yourself better. 

Sorry if this post sounds like bragging, but few people in my life will understand how far I've come, I know some people here will understand.",73,0

Laying all cards on the table here, I moved out of my home state 3 years ago (Marijuana is illegal in this state) to a legal state. As a way to cope with loneliness and all the change I started smoking a lot more often (Back home it was once a week with the homies at a party or something, and the weed we were getting was not good), where as I would be smoking multiple times a week. Fast forward to March 2020, when covid hit I went insane. I got my medical card, was smoking 5,6,7+ bowls a day, it got to a point where I wouldn’t even feel high. I’ve been struggling with this addiction for the last year heavily, literally I would get high and immediately think “I need to quit”. Well fast forward to recently, I got my heartbroken, so like any addict I went to my crutch, marijuana (keep in mind I smoke both flower and dabs and hit them back to back daily), but this high was different. Straight anxiety attack (& I have an anxiety disorder so I can normally manage them, but this was something else). I’m on day 3 here. Just feeling down in the dumps.

This truly feels like a breakup or falling out with a friend or SO. I have had depressing fallouts with 3 girls in my lifetime. One was a really close friend that was told she could no longer talk to me by her BF, one because of work, and one due to her cheating.

Just like Mary, I loved all 3 of those individuals with my full heart. When the fallout occurred, I missed them so much and couldn’t believe they were gone. The thing was though, it was over and I knew it. It had to be over. I had to let go. I couldn’t reach out, I couldn’t go back, they were gone and I had to continue forward through a rollercoaster of emotions, just like I did this week.

I’ve made it many years without my friend and Ex’s after our fallouts and I will make it years without Mary. It has always been for my best interest.

Congrats to me on 1 week free of the abusive relationship I had developed over the course of a DECADE.

I’ve decided to stop smoking like more than a month ago (in reality since like a year ago I’ve wanted but never did it properly until 6 months ago when I did go through a month and half without smoking, then wanted to celebrate by smoking, well I’ve fallen back after this), but wasn’t “successful” until like 2 weeks ago, ya I still did couple times, but just one joint that I was able to find the droppings of weed from my shed (where I always smoked) or from leftover joints which I collected then rolled up from them, basically I’ve just smoked cause I got drunk and my dumb brain wanted some, or once cause I’ve gotten into an argument. 

Anyways I did definitely seen some negatives after smoking weed, especially it was just one joint. 

My question is, can you still get withdrawals after smoking one joint, even when you didn’t smoke for couple days and by that time the withdrawals subsided? Cause I’ve noticed “light?” withdrawals when I’ve just smoked one joint a couple days ago. 

Basically I’ve noticed that I’m sweating a lot now, and I do know it can be caused by not smoking weed.

I didn’t need it to help me quit but I do need it to understand why I feel certain ways at certain times. 

Also a big thing is controlling who surrounds you. I have many great friends back home but they’re the not always the best influences so having a fresh start in a new city has helped me surround myself with people who aren’t always looking to drink smoke and take drugs.

Things that ive noticed is that you have to face your problems and emotions directly instead of smoking to feel better. Besides that i feel a bit 'clearer' during the day. I dont really know if i feel better or worse so its a little bit hard to stay away from weed. So im curious, has quitting weed benefited you in any way?

I have been consistently smoking for around 2 years now, and like a lot of others, it started as something that was seen as a party favor or something when friends were over. I'm in high school and live with my parents so my way to get around them was to vape carts. Horrible decision. I was buying around a cart a month, and then once a week, and before I knew it I'm finishing the whole thing 1-2 days. My weeks consisted of trying to get money no matter the cost to buy my next pen. I would sneak money from my family and even sell things around the house. Smoking plant doesn't get me high, smoking concentrates doesn't get me high, and I even smoked out of a dab rig and it got me buzzed for around 20 minutes. It got to the point where I would be tweaking out because I wasn't smoking, right after I smoked. Insane I know. I've been trying to lower consumption since the beginning of the year, not one time did I slow down, instead, I sped up and smoked even more. I was around the point of I couldn't smoke less than 4 times a day and I knew I had to stop no matter what. I ended up giving everything to my mom and telling her everything in hope she can help me. I gave her 300$+ of it and we dumped it together. Thursday was the first time I had gone 1 day without smoking in almost a year. My withdrawal symptoms are horrible. I'm at day 3 or 4 and today just made me want to die. All I can think about is smoking. I can't sleep, can't eat, and I feel like shit. Currently, I'm out of my state so luckily I can't get my hands on anything, but I'm scared I'm just going to collapse right back to where I was sooner than later.

I stopped smoking because of what a lot of people here experienced--a safety blanket that was too safe and didn't allow for growth. A way to not feel things. I recognized that in myself and made the decision to stop. The first week was bad, then it got easier and easier. Now, however, I feel worse than before, due to anxiety about real-life things. 

About a week into sobriety a guy crashed into me and totalled my car. His insurance paid me out more than I paid for the car, but that next month was spent frantically looking for another one. On top of that, the house I was renting from began the process of foreclosure due to mismanagement on the landlord's part, and roommates getting unemployment but refusing to pay rent. I paid my rent through the entirety of the pandemic, and was still losing my home. I felt cheated. Still, I did not smoke. But it was a rough time. 

After the car was figured out, my SO and I looked at place after place until we found something we both really loved, a place to ourselves with no roommates. The only problem is that it's an hour from work, and although we both practically work the same schedule and will commute together, my anxiety has been off the rails because I'm imagining everything that could go wrong. I also act like I'm incapable of finding a job elsewhere. I still haven't smoked. 

This is where I'm at right now. I just feel so weak. Smoking dulled my senses, I was never strong enough to feel them in their entirety and now they're hitting me full force. I know going back isn't an option, at this point I could pass a drug test and get a better job. But I've been medicating with alcohol a lot lately and I know that's not good either. I don't know, man. I'm sitting here at work spiraling. I thought it would get easier. But I just feel like a broken child.",2,1

Before, I was smoking pretty much before noon and throughout the day every day. 

The first few of years smoking I was only working part time and was often high at work. Yikes. Retail stock position. That’s towing the line for sure. Young and dumb. I thought I was slick and I thought I worked better with it of course. I was mostly just burnt out in my obsessive anxieties of that era of my life. With those 10 minutes or so of feeling super high and good. But those ten minutes are so fleeting. 

Except for a handful of really amazing experiences the first few times I smoked in the beginning and a few times over the 7 years I did it, that was the story for me- 10 minutes of a good high and then just burnt out haze. Confused. Thinking I was making some kind of progress in life, spiritually. That had to have been thousands of wasted bowls and pen hits. 

Around 2016 I started van dwelling and doing doordash. I was stoned most of the time. I distanced myself from my family and cut all friends out. I was isolated and it wasn’t good. There were good things about this period though. I made contact with a woman who became my mentor. I went on this really amazing retreat in the mountains in 2018.

I started working out at the end of 2018. My new favorite thing to do was hit my vape pen every morning really early right before my main lift. Right there in the gym. I was trying to transcend!! I don’t recommend it. Just like driving while high, I could do it but wouldn’t recommend it to others.

Fast forward to the beginning of 2020 and my van started having real issues. I determined it was time for me to finally get a real job. I started working at this restaurant. My van finally did break down and I was just living out of my broken down van and working at this restaurant. I quit my job in may 2020 and right before my last day of work I came back to my van to find it towed away! 

Now entirely homeless, I reached out to my mentor friend. She invited me to come stay in her and her partners trailer on the property of their home in another state. So that what I did.

When I got there she told me I should probably stop smoking. I didn’t listen. I got job in town and kept on smoking. After a few months she decided I had mooched off them enough and kicked me out. 

I didn’t want to go home to my family. I left for the city and just air b n b’d doing doordash on bicycle. Determined to continue smoking. I ended up camping outside every night to save money to try to rent a room/ getting it together. Being a deliver driver vagabond was never forever for me in my mind. I wanted to get a place and a real job and I was sure I needed to sleep outside for a while to be able to make that a reality for me, if I wasn’t going to ask for help from anyone. 

I wasn’t like a regular homeless junkie, i set up camp every night In the suburbs in safe places. I didn’t associate with other vagabond type people. I was totally by myself. If I didn’t have my backpack and rig with me you wouldnt have known I was homeless.

Around November it was getting pretty cold and I decided I was going to bike down south to California and warm my bones and make some good delivery money in SF. I made it about 100 miles south, delivering food along the way when my doordash account got deactivated. I wasn’t completing every order. I would often accept orders and then decided not to do it and unassign myself before I picked up the food.

I reached out to my friend again and they invited me back to live with them for at least a few days and possibly longer term. I made it back to the coast where they were and she had a big talk with me. Basically told me to stop smoking. This time I listened. I threw all of my stuff away.

She ended up telling me to just finally go home and have my parents help me get back on my feet and so that’s what I did. I flew back home and lived with my parents until early April. They got me a new car and I drove back up to the area my mentor friends live in because it’s affordable and I like the area. I still have yet to find a room to rent. I’ve just been camping and sleeping my car again! But this is only temporary. It’s different than before because I’m determined to get a room and get some stability going. And also, I’m not stoned.

I have a full time job at the moment. I did put my two weeks in because it’s not a great job and I’m trying to get my old job back that I had the last time I lived here. I may go over to Eugene and live in a hostel for a few months delivering food for a few months because I can only camp for a 14 days at a time and sleeping in my car sucks. I want to be sleeping in a real bed for a while. Hopefully the job I do want will hire me by then. If not I’ll try and come back in the fall when more rooms will go up for rent. 

Anyways I was driving back to my camp site last week and now that I’m leaving my current job at good will I don’t have to worry about being drug tested. My mentor friend isn’t really talking to me right now because I think she’s just leaving me to work on things myself. That’s a whole other topic. Anyways I had the fleeting thought of picking up some weed. Right then this local vagrant type guy that comes into the store I work at every now and then veers off with his bicycle off the sidewalk and started riding in the street right in my lane in front of me. I thought, no. That’s what’s waiting for me if I go back. Not that I was anything like this local thief or would ever get as low and dirty in life like him. But I could end up just out there again, homeless on bicycle. It’s a rough life.

I’m so glad I stopped. The ten minutes of good high wears off into hazy self deception. It’s not worth it. I am grateful for that handful of good psychedelic esque experiences I had over those seven years. As Alan Watts says, once you e gotten the message, hang up the phone. They helped me see things I never would have other wise, but on the whole, smoking was never like that.",1,0

I won't lie, I still crave the stuff like mad but today I didn't cave in, I went out and bought gardening tools and spent hours cutting overgrown grass and pulling weeds out of my garden. It was tiring work but very rewarding to know put my time to practical use.

I managed to stay clean and serene to this day. Still going strong and I feel many differences between me as a stoner and now. My way of thinking and looking at problems, desire and motivation to make something out of my life other then just work and use. 

Realizing that all my friends I had , I met them through using and so on. That was very painful to cope with since I broke contact with any of them. For over 14 years I hanged out with them, with some I had stronger bond than the other. But since I quit I stopped calling them and since they never call me now I realize thag we never been actually friends, just a bunch of junkies who used together. How painful this is, but also very helpful to determination to go on with my life from now on. I stay strong through my contacts at the local NA and my family. 

To all quitters who just started, please try and keep going, after a month, every day you will realize that it was worth the pain the sweat and the sleepless nights. Otherwise you never come out of that damned smoke curtain.

I imagine how it would change my life for the better. Then you get it and in a matter of weeks life is just the same as it was. I think weed, for me, was like that. I was wanted my life to be better, and I only had to spend a few bucks to get there. It didn't change my life, so I tried again. Then I got depressed because it wasn't working as intended, but I still kept trying.

So I stopped that cycle 70 days ago. Started with 3 day gaps between smoking. Then I did a week. Then I did 10 days. Now I am at 70 days. I still feel like shit. I still look for things to make my life better. But at least I know it is because of me and not because of weed. That is the best part of being clean. When I smoked, I thought all my mental issues were because of smoking. ""When I stop, it will go away"". It has gotten better, but it did not all go away. However, now I have the motivation to fix them; I do not have the apathy toward them that I once had.

Since I stopped I got a good job, rekindled with old friends, started lifting again, started dieting, wrote songs and practiced alone for hours after work, got back into my local open mic scene and have felt like I'm fitting in there too, I run and ride bikes now too. I'm doing a lot better. There is a shame for what my life once was: chasing weed, riding my bike 40 minutes to the train to spend an hour to go the Harold Washington Library for the slim chance that a dealer would be sitting outside like usual, picking weed crumbs out of the carpet to build a small little pile to get one hit, breaking bowls to smoke the resin, spending 1000s on weed. I hate that I did all that and all the using friends to get drugs and the weird things I did while high. But it is somewhat behind me now and I take solace in that.

Recently when I get high, it's much less potent, and I just feel sad and lonely. And confused. I'm tired of feeling like this. I have the power and intelligence to stop doing this.

I didn’t realize I was using it that way, I just thought I was having a few joints “to relax” until it became a wake and bake on my days off too. Always doing the same shit, sitting in bed/couch playing ps4 that I didn’t enjoy anymore but too unmotivated to do anything else. Recently my relationship with my girlfriend ended and my heart is breaking so bad, of course in order to feel something I turned to drugs to help me, as soon as I took that drug I realized I didn’t want it. In fairness to me I didn’t touch weed that night at all and I just sat there pissed off with myself that I would take drugs at 2am and how I have disrespected myself and my body and more importantly my ex. 

The next day (yesterday) I felt the worst I ever felt, so horribly depressed that I could see why someone would commit suicide from these feelings (not that I would but I could understand) but I said to myself that I deserved to suffer and feel this way after how selfish I have been and the east way out would have been weed but I didn’t give in. The depression and the breakup was so bad it was giving me pain, but I wasn’t going to use weed to numb this. I needed to suffer to show myself that I don’t need that shit. I needed to scare myself that if I continue doing drugs, especially weed this is how I would feel a lot more. Additionally, that depressive thoughts showed me where I have gone wrong in my relationship and hopefully I’ll be able to meet my ex soon and just apologize for being so closed to her and to make her realize that I see where I have gone wrong and mistreated her.

It was impossible for me to set boundaries or have the slightest control over things, and I literally almost felt I needed it to be able to survive. There was no way I could see that it was actually weed that was smoking me. I completely lost myself in the haze for long periods of time. 

Now I have been sober for a bit over two months and even though I quit a few times before, this time I am genuinely putting the biggest effort I can to changing my life to the better and being completely sober. 

Recently I have just been reflecting endlessly about my previous lifestyle and having thoughts running through my head and thinking about choices I have made and I almost feel like it was a completely different person not so long ago, there are so many things I can say that have changed immensely since i quit and it's scary to think about it sometimes. How addicted I was, all the motivation I had to just be able to get high and forget everything else that was important.

I wasn’t planning on quitting for an extended period of time, just wanted to get it out of my system for any potential drug tests and I was in need of a T break as it was. But, after the last couple of days of coughing up phlegm with a sore throat, having road rage and being pissed off for no reason, and feeling depressed and alone, I’m realizing this can’t just be a break but a permanent resolution.  

I’ve struggled with Crohn’s disease (a great excuse to smoke weed even though my prescribed medication works better), depression and anxiety since my early teens. I’m a very reserved and introverted person. I get lonely plenty of times but didn’t mind so much solitude when I had weed to smoke - which was the reason I started using in the first place. Now with no plant, there’s no crutch for the tangled up thoughts/memories that bring me down. I thought the “high” was lifting me up, but I was really suppressing the unhealthy beliefs I have about myself instead of confronting/dealing with them. This, combined with the physical symptoms that have lead to me feeling like shit, makes me realize the mistake I made for smoking so much for so long. I never want to feel like this again.

i wake up energized and enthusiastic to get things done. i interact with my family without carrying the unwanted paranoia and anxiety that always seemed to follow me home after a smoke session. i lay outside in the sun without scoping out the best and most concealed spots that would be sure to do the trick. i savor the flavors produced by my taste buds without imagining how much more stimulated they’d be if i were high. my day is no longer scheduled around and dependent on the premise of me smoking. 

best of all, the haze that once blanketed my life has finally been lifted. i remember conversations that i happily, not anxiously, took part in. i am able to do mental math and complex thinking on the spot again. i am filled with happiness and positivity all day long, rather than just the couple hours after i had smoked. i am the full potential version of myself again. 

i am grateful that i have been able to witness and identify the changes that took place in my life after leaving our bittersweet friend. it has led to my possession of this mentality. i no longer seek the highs that never seemed to fulfill my cravings, both in strength and duration. what once seemed impossible has become a reality.

I want to share a quick story about why my some of my milestones felt so different (30, 60, 90, and 100 days), and why every day of being clean counts.

The first month was rough. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, and I felt massive regret for missing out on the social aspects of smoking. I experienced intense cravings to smoke to take the edge off the additional stress from starting a new job as well. But through the process of quitting, over the next two months, I realized that I didn't actually like who I had become when I was addicted to weed... I inadvertently destroyed relationships, possessed little to no self-awareness, and honestly carried a lot of self-hatred. Since quitting, I've committed to consistent therapy, I've replaced smoking with different hobbies (running, being more active in general) and I've worked on rebuilding my self-confidence. Despite all of this, at the 90-day milestone, I felt absolutely.... nothing. No sense of accomplishment, no feeling of fulfillment. I knew I could keep going, but nothing was particularly stopping me from relapsing.  

BUT THEN SOMETHING WILD HAPPENED. A couple of days ago, I hit my 100-day milestone. Since then, my brain has been doing something. It's really, really difficult to describe but if I had to guess, my brain is working hard to rewire itself and repair my blunted dopamine receptors. For example, today I accomplished something pretty significant at work... usually I wouldn't think much of it and just carry on with the day. But after work when I lay on my bed, MY BRAIN FELT VERY HAPPY. This feeling is SO foreign to me, and **the only thing I can compare this feeling to** is the feeling I got whenever I got stoned. Except it feels better, because I genuinely felt a sense of DEEP PLEASURE AND REWARD and I was 100% sober. 

I don't even know what else to say. I just want to say, for anyone struggling to stay on track, please don't quit. If this is how good my brain can feel 100 days in, I can't wait for what my progress will look like in another 100 days, or a year in.",19,0

^ This is a saying that I have resonated with over the last week, I messed up and smoked last weekend, back on day 6 now. Understanding when the addictive voice is resonating over your true conscious self is a big step in the process of stopping (at least it is for me). 

In the car on my way to work this morning I felt so good, sleeping better, dreaming again and not hazed over in the morning. I'm a lot more attentive at work and more productive with my studies. I have exams coming up and don't need this shit hanging over me. Been smoking almost every day for the last 7 years and it's only in 2021 that I've had that ""penny drop"" moment. I've had some times where I've stopped for other people's benefits but never quit for my own good. This time feels really good because I'm doing it for me. Like I should have always done.

I kept my stash and my pipes and everything but hid them away under my bed. I told myself that I was keeping them incase of zombie apocalypse or something.

But I have been clean one whole year today and I decided it was time to finally let that go. Throwing away such a big part of my twenties feels weird. Throwing away all that money invested feels weird. But I know I’m never going back. 

I was in the worst place mentally when I quit. I wasn’t taking care of myself. I was trying to numb myself out of the pain but smoking wasn’t helping anymore and it was giving me more anxiety and I knew it was just making everything worse. I knew I couldn’t stop on my own being in the same environment, so I went and stayed with my sister for a month and picked up her ukulele and obsessively learned how to play to calm my nervous energy. I thought I just needed a break from it but when I got back home I smelled my room and was disgusted. I didn’t want it like I thought I would, so I packed away all the things. I didn’t intend to fully quit a year ago but I’m so glad I did. It didn’t solve all of my life’s issues of course, I still have a long way to go but at least I can be proud of myself for this.

I’ve been consistently working out for a while now..months... this past month since I’ve been sober I’ve been focusing even harder on my workouts. Last week on one of my rest days, while at home I stood up to go use the restroom and had this flush of, idk what to call, it fall over me. My knees felt week , my vision got darker and I ALMOST completely passed out. After talking to my gf and mother shortly after they said it could’ve been dehydration and the lack of nutrients. I admit I didn’t eat THAT much that day and hadn’t had a proper bottle of water. So I thought to drink and eat and felt slightly better but the dizziness that followed this incident prevailed.

(Day 16),"Hi everyone, I just joined this sub today and have been extremely anxious since quitting about 2 weeks ago. Before this, I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years and have had multiple week long breaks or so for family vacations with no real problems.

The reason I quit was because I’ve been having anxiety at my internship. I was able to smoke and go to work the next day for a few months but then I started to feel super anxious about my life revolving around smoking as soon as I came home. That was the only part of the day where I felt comfortable and relaxed. 

The last strain I had also gave me some bad highs so I haven’t had any cravings to smoke either.

Since I quit I have been having really bad waves of anxiety over most activities and anything social. I find myself extremely worried for no reason whenever I have to do anything. In general, I’m just never able to chill out or be relaxed anymore.

Any advice for dealing with this? When does the anxiety go away?",5,0

Accomplishments are more significant, laugher feels AMAZING, sadness is felt deeply and praise from people means so much more. The praise part has been really significant. Before, I would always be running away to get high or to break away from a social setting. This made me much more socially anxious. But now, I no longer need to worry about people noticing my red eyes, or my dry sounding mouth. I can be myself and not worry about people wondering what’s going on with me.

When you smoke a large amount of weed before bed it may help you fall asleep faster - but it destroys your sleep and barely lets you fall into a deep sleep, hence why you wake up feeling tired.

For the last 2 years of my weed usage I was a horribly sleeper, tossing and turning, only being able to fall asleep from being too high or pure exhaustion.

I’ve been sober 23 days and I’m beginning to have the best sleeps I’ve had in years!

- I don’t toss and turn anymore
- I wake up feeling refreshed most days
- I fall asleep WAY faster
- I actually have DREAMS again

THEY WILL PASS!

I smoked it every night and sometimes all day for 6.5 years.  I am also 495 days clean of a 35-year smoking habit.  I am a 50 year-old female in the throes of menopause and exhaustion from a long career in technology.  

Lessons Learned:

* **Weed is just 'filler'** as it kills time in life because **life can be incredibly boring**.  I get up every day, groom, go to my office, do meetings, write stuff, then I workout, eat, groom, sleep, and repeat.   Weed occupied time.
* **Quitting is not a panacea for life's problems**.  Problems exist whether I get high or not.  It's just a question of whether I'm willing to consciously deal with them or not.
* **Clarity of thought.**  I realized that some of my grudges and disdain for people in my family was built up in my head because weed clouded my judgment.  I have humbled myself and reengaged with my family because I am capable of seeing all sides now and the truth is, I have been an asshole.  
* **Smoking is smoking is smoking.**  Inhaling anything into the lungs is bad.  My workouts are amazing now and I am 50 years old kicking the ass of much younger people in my Orange Theory workouts.  Also, my body aches less since I eliminated all forms of smoking.  
* **Getting older is just hard.**  I am 50 years old and in menopause, which sucks completely; however, getting older is challenging and smoking weed or any other substance was making getting older harder.  
* **Less depressed, less anxious.**  I am still depressed and I am still anxious but not nearly as bad.  
* **Memory is much better.**  My memory is far better than it was when I smoked weed.
* **Weed is no longer the center of my life.**  I used to make every accommodation to ensure that I could get home to my pipe and now, I feel unfettered and free to do other things b/c weed no longer dictates my life.  
* **Mary Jane will leave.**  I don't think about weed at all anymore.  

This probably doesn't read like the rah-rah that I was feeling when I first quit because, well, life has settled back in for me and while I still struggle with the reality of life in general, I have no regrets about ditching THC.  Not one.

It stopped being fun when I wouldn't do anything productive when I smoked but simply sat around. Sure, I was still quite introspective but I was no longer doing yoga, journaling, or propelling myself forward. It stopped being fun when I couldn't get a solid night sleep and the next day I had to pull myself out of bed. It stopped being fun when I could no longer run at my typical pace without my heart rate shooting up.

I am one day sober and for the first time in what feels like forever I actually got out of bed when my alarm went off. I didn't succumb to this immediate depression. It took a while to realize that this constant low wasn't just my depression but probably the weed I was smoking daily. I'm in the middle of transitioning meds and while weed seemed like the only thing that helped my lows and made my happy, in the long run it was just the vicious cycle. How can I truly heal if I'm never completely sober in my downtime?

I realized that when I smoke, I can become awkward. It's hard for me to communicate. I don't care about myself, my responsibilities, or the feelings of any friends or family members. 

And that I don't have control at all. AT ALL. I started smoking Day 1 constantly, it was never ending. 

If I can give anyone advice, it would be to put your time into something that you can value long-term. Weed will not get you there. While you think it may be helping you (which is might be, short term), the plateau will hit and the problems will arise. 

While I'm at Day 1 again, I know that I'm able to get through this now, especially since I know I won't ever be able to consume weed in a healthy way. Seeing those glimpses of growth and strides are so worth it, trust me. You can do this!",15,0

I searched for experiences similar to this but most just had to do with weight loss due to low appetite immediately after quitting.

After nearly 10 year of smoking daily and quite a few botched attempts at quitting, I've been sober for about 6 weeks now- my appetite suffered a good bit at the beginning, but has been back in full force for about a month now. I am eating way more than I used to and way more consistently. Prior to quitting I would usually fast from the time I woke up until dinner. I'd have a large dinner and then snacks til I passed out on the couch. Now I wake up and eat breakfast, lunch around noon or 1, some snacks around 4, and then dinner. Pretty standard stuff.

What I'm confused about is that I have lost a good bit of weight, and that's really not great considering I was already small to begin with- I just noticed how drastic it was today when I tried on my shorts from last summer and none of them fit me anymore. I weighed myself and I'm down from 115 to 105 and I'm concerned. I really don't want to continue to lose weight. I don't feel sick at all- in fact I feel great. Lots of energy, way less digestive problems.

To this day I don't wish my father to have done anything differently, except to feel worthy and secure in himself. I'm not sure he does or ever will, but I refuse to continue down his path. As an adult I see his pain, and while valid I know for a fact he didn't need a substance to be whole. My mom used to say, ""I don't need the stuff. I get high on life."" I thought that was stupid, but in retrospect it's so much more fulfilling to get high on life because it brings growth and diversity where I previously just saw a cloud of smoke.

Day after day goes by, dollar after dollar spent, and then one day you wake up and realize your life was put on hold every moment you took a hit. Those dreams you had, that job you wanted, those relationships you could have made, all lost because you were constantly “escaping”. 

The true escape is when you realize reality is scary but navigable. Life is hard but that’s what makes it so beautiful. 

A year ago I was constantly in flight mode, avoiding my traumas and struggles, choosing to believe I didn’t deserve or wasn’t capable of achieving my dreams.

I was in love. 

Fast forward a couple of years into smoking my friend dies and my girlfriend falls out of love with me and dumps me. My depression comes back and I start to smoke daily and nightly to stop the pain. Within a blink of an eye it’s 5 years later and my mental health hasn’t gotten any better in fact it has gotten worse because now I’m showing signs of bipolar. I end up in a mental health hospital and I stay there for 1 month. This happens again a year later because I decided not to quit despite what all the professionals tell me. The third time i ended up in hospital in late 2019 was when I decided it was time to quit, it took me a long time get the courage but as today I’ve been sober for 1 year and 2 days.

Quitting weed has given me the opportunity to look within my self without the cloud of smoke and actually try and heal myself of those two things I mentioned previously. Because of weed it’s like my life got put on standstill. I hate weed and what it has put me through.",43,0
121,2021-05-28 10:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nmz40h/35mtxafam/,35/M/TX/Af-Am,"I am a recovering hedonist, alcoholic, tobacco smoker, pill popper, and dopefiend. For 12 years, I've always preferred the synergistic effect of all of these drugs at once, and for twelve years my primary mode of operation was under the influence of all of these drugs at once, every day, whether at work or home or church or the road or asleep. 

Now, I haven't had alcohol in two years. No tobacco in one. No pills in three. Yesterday was the last time I smoked bud, and I've been actively quitting (no ""try"") for about 6 months now. Below is the latest metaphor that has occurred to me, and though I have nothing to say here that has not already been said, and that better, by hundreds here on this thread, I want to share, for me and for you. Bless you. 

Getting high, for me, is like a trip to the zoo. I always imagine the thrill of seeing the majesty of creation up close, but when I get there, park and pay, then begin to walk around and observe, I remember that I've yearned and paid for the right to visit a living prison. That is the reality of what a zoo is, animals all trapped in cages, and I am stricken with the obvious understanding that these animals know and feel that they are trapped in cages. The animals don't pose and perform for the guests, like the movie Madagascar. In fact, the movie itself being animated bears witness to the fact that I am being sold a lie through cartoon that reality has never produced. Because eighty percent of the time, and for ninety percent of the animals, they are hiding out in their caves, sleeping, lying around motionless, or have peeled off into a corner as far distant as possible from all curious, lustful eyes. They are still beautiful to behold, just the nature of them being. Certainly, a .jpg of a rhinocerous is nothing compared to seeing the massive armor and spear of the beast as she lives and breathes. But they do not roar or prance or trumpet or caw or swing or swim. They breathe, biding time, slowing and depressing their greatness in hopes that people will stop coming, stop paying, at which point it would only be meet to let them go free. But I think also, that they know this scenario is immensely unlikely. People pose awkwardly for photos, squeeze into the tightest crowds to get a glimpse of these magnificent beasts and creatures, all languishing at a pitiful, resigned fraction of their actual potential. All oppressed and depressed at their station. Though I expect my excitement at seeing them should be enough to encourage their willing production, obviously, it doesn't. 

I've realized now that my ""imagination"" of what a zoo is does not fit the ""reality"" of my experiences at the zoo. The exact same is true of my experiences with weed. Craving, wanting and anticipating the high, the thrill and stress of the search, setting the meet, the hopeful stress of anticipation, the paying, the rolling, the lighting up, are all the same as my desires and plans and hopes when I plan a trip to the zoo. I want to bear witness (craving), set the date (hit the connect), drive (waiting, always waiting), park (relief within hopeful reach), pay (copping), and enter (smoking). 

After those first ritual moments, the ushering in of the experience, the commencement of expectation and the culmination of anticipation and fulfillment, I am immediately reminded that I have been happily compelled to witness oppressed creatures as sport, for pleasure. Why not pay a fee to walk around Huntsville State Penitentiary and gawk at the death row inmates as they wrestle in the throes of ego death and mental illness, the pathologies of the terminally insecure? What latent, dubious inner longing draws me thus? To such? 

Only, on weed, my mind becomes the zoo. Bars are erected around my plans which become mere imaginings. I muse over many ""To-Do"" lists. I am tormented by ideas, that I can only see them but cannot touch them, manipulate them, ride them, hug them, or grow them. They languish. They become the heavy, torpid beasts at the zoo. They become obsessive and compulsive, always readying the way, always inching but never leaping. They waste away as shells of their wild selves. A living space filled with dead ambition; this is being high. If I smoke, I will ""see"" but I will not ""become"". Sober, I shall become, but I must wrestle with the uncertainty of not ""seeing"". 

It is at this juncture where my critical decision lies. 

You all have encouraged my soul more than you can know. This thread is the opposite of the zoo experience, for me. Here, I always procrastinate coming, fearing my own uncertainties, but I am never, ever disappointed after I leave. You're a blessing to me. You.

I posted at the start of the week moaning about how I just couldnt kick this addiction. Everyone who commented, thank you so much, your comments were honestly so kind and inspiring even though my post was just frustrated boohooing. 

Its friday today. I havent done anything all week except get high. I'm gonna be honest, it was kinda deliberate. I took my foot off the brake and just let my addiction run where it wanted to run. When I say I did nothing, I mean *literally* nothing. I wasn't fun, I wasnt interesting, I was tired and boring and sedated. This week I was a shell of myself.

I dont want that. I really dont want that. I couldnt do anything. Weed paralysed me. And it wasnt even enjoyable. I could feel the dopamine release, but it wasnt really fun? If that makes sense? I honestly just kinda wanted it over. And yet, I couldnt stop, in that moment, when I was stoned, the pull was too strong.

I woke up several times this morning in a half asleep doze. My dream kept talking about seeing clearly, or seeking the light at the end of the tunnel, or about letting go. I know it was probably just my brain rehashing my day, but I am feeling a strong resolve. 

I'm done with this drug. I'm done with the reality of addiction. It's not cute, it's not fun, it's not a secret to a good life that society has tried to hide from me. It's a trap, and one I'm tired of living in. 

I spent the last few times smoking paying attention to how I actually felt. It wasnt that I didnt want to do my work or hobbies stoned, it was that it felt too difficult to fight through the brain fog. It wasnt that I was lazy, it's that weed literally made me feel tired and sedated. I dont want any of that. 

My stumbling block has been consistently around the 2 week mark recently. That's a big improvement from earlier in the year. I think that those failures are basically because I can go about 2 weeks without feeling a strong need to switch my brain off over an evening or whatever and caving into cravings. I have a two pronged plan: realise that that feeling is in fact a physiological craving as thc is still leaving my cells by 2 weeks, and name and write down what I am craving from the weed. So if I'm craving entertainment, write that down. If I'm craving to relax and switch off, write that. That way I can focus on satisfying the genuine source of the craving, in an actually satisfying manner. 

I'm feeling optimistic, by still unsure if this is going to stick. I really really want it to, but I'm also tired of letting myself down in the face of this. I'm tired of fighting this fight, and I just want it to be over. But I dont think using weed will ever make it over. Using again will only extend the process.

Thank you, if you've made it this far into my ramble. I really appreciate all the love and support from this community, and how open you all are to accept people like me who try and fail at this half a million times before it sticks. You really are the best",13,0

I've smoked pot my whole like since I was 14 yes old till 29. Full time, before work, lunch breaks, after work full time.

Always wanted to quit and never could get myself too.

Last year in August I met a guy n he absolutely hated it and helped me slowly getting off the cones and I eventually did. I just stopped completely for 8 months and I have no idea how and I feel like it was because his anger scared me and he fed me lots of alcohol.

Now I'm single and started smoking again with a new guy I'm seeing. I've moved in and weed has become an fight topic with the new guy (scoring and how much I smoke etc) I smoke heaps.

I'm trying to quit again. Today I started and gone 24 hours so far with no smoke.

But I checked into a hotel to get away from the weed and give me some space.

Tomorrow I go home and weed will be very easily accessible and seen.

I don't wanna cave in but I know as soon as I'm stressed I want a cone.

I always work an amazing job in health care and I don't want to now loose this if I get tested.

- The insomnia sucks but the quality of the sleep I did get was better than it was while I was smoking. 

- Physical withdrawal symptoms don't have to slowly  build up over time, I can be fine most of the time and have them in attacks. 

- Having social support really helps, even if it's just in an online forum like this one. 

- Journaling about what I am experiencing helps to become aware of potential pitfalls *and* reminds me that feelings are fleeting in nature. 

- Cravings pass just like other emotions, especially when I can distract myself. 

- I also have a problem with caffeine. Might be something I'll want to tackle next.

- I am substituting smoking with food sometimes. Important to make sure this won't continue after the initial phase. 

- I was hoping to see improvement in lung function but that takes longer than one week. 

- I've saved about 100 euros this week. 

- I had forgotten how much it sucks for your house and clothes to smell like smoke. I want them to keep smelling nice.

- I can do so much more in one day now. 

- I seem to forget less.

- I feel more connected to my friends when I see them now. 

- I really hate my parents at the moment and feel like not having the safety net of getting high forces me to stop pretending everything is fine around them (which is unpleasant but ultimately much healthier).

Also, while high I tend to act weird, like a maniac. I speak out loud alone, like if I am the protagonist of a show. I make weird faces, and my logical thinking is out of place. I think things that made no sense. And this worries me becouse I feel like I'm losing grasp of reality. I spent a lot of time alone.

I wish I could post about how my life has improved as a result of quitting. But that’s not how it works. Not every time. Quitting just removes a variable. For some, weed’s the variable making the equation irresolvable. Those are the lucky ones. Others have a different equation. We’re addicted to *getting high*. The supra-mundane. The state of not being normal. The crib, the vessel.

To us, removing weed plunges us into a sea of the everyday. And we tread water for dear life, wide-eyed, choking on the salty foam coating the surface of each wide swell pulling our bodies indifferently to nowhere. We kick frantically, then instinctually, below the surface, our arms tracing the same figure-8’s we were taught as children, when swimming was something new for us, when it looked like fun. When the water was a welcome refresher from the beating sun, from the hot ground beneath our feet. Now, from our vantage point inches above the surface, we wish for land, even way off in the distance… something to swim towards. But there’s only open ocean, and we’re getting tired. Distraught, we long for the raft we once knew—the raft that kept us dry, even if we had no paddle, and we spent ourselves constantly re-inflating it, and our muscles atrophied from the confinement of its cramped quarters. Surely *that* was better than *this*. That was, at least, sustainable, in its own pathetic way. Here we might drown. Any day now. So tired. The prospect of keeping this up forever seems impossible. Is *this* life?

But then, we remember. Something so deep it comes from a part of us beyond authorship. Something no one can take credit for. Something elemental. Something essential. In the salt water, we are *buoyant*. With hesitation, we stop kicking, stop flailing, and *let go*. Our noses dip below the surface after drawing one final breath. The water slips past our eyelids, level with our pupils. We see the infinite horizon and blurry depths simultaneously. It stings. And then, like magic, our legs come up. Our arms drift to our sides, listlessly, our torsos suspended at the surface, our noses sticking out into the air like shark fins. Our breaths are easy. The swells cradle us. The sky is a beautiful baby blue. We are *okay*.",38,0

My issue is that any time I have a day off and the house to myself - I start to think that maybe I could just buy a little nug as a treat.

So I am 46 days quit and once I began to fall asleep fairly regularly my problem is now that I sleep waay too deeply throughout the night with fairly intense dreams.

Craving a drink?,"I definitely can say that I enjoyed somewhat of a 'sober high' - feeling clarity and happiness from shaking off the mental fog and overall depressive attitude I had whilst using. Mind you this was after going through about a week to 10 days of a mild but irritating withdrawal (headaches, sensitivities to light and sound, and feeling easily overwhelmed in public or alone)

BUT - now I have passed this point and I'm starting to deal with some anxiety and spaciness like I've never really experienced before... probably because I'm sober.  Awesome. I've really been trying to socialize more with friends over these last 41 days which means that I have drunk more alcohol than I EVER did before (not a lot I'm a lightweight - but still more than before which was none) and I'm like..craving it now? I'm craving anything that can calm my nerves and relaxes me? I'm nearing the end of my semester and I have an internship interview tomorrow for a company that is really reputable and professional and I JUST CAN'T CALM DOWN. I'm so anxious.

I guess I'm just here to rant and see if anyone can relate to this or give me any words of wisdom. This community is the only reason I've gotten out of my smoking habits (I was a daily bowl smoker for 5 years) and I really need some love from the community.",5,0
152,2021-05-27 20:40:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nmlti1/thinking_about_smoking_again_nah/,Thinking about smoking again? Nah.,"I found this group right before I quit. I’ve been thinking about how I felt around that time. Daily smoking, but pretty desperately wanting to be sober. It’s been about 4 years since then and tbh, I have smoked a couple times- Can probably count on one hand.

But I just wanted to say, in case anyone is starting out and having that struggle with their brain: “It’s really not that bad, you can smoke just once and be done”, “you’re not addicted tho… weed isn’t addictive”, “fuck it.”, etc… - these thoughts do get quieter over time. Initially, I used to remind myself of the negatives since my brain would be shouting the positives. How sluggish I felt, how stupid and aloof I felt especially socially. How annoyed I would get at myself for saying/doing something completely air-headed or naive. Spending all day thinking of things I want to do but doing none of those things. How Much money I spent on weed. How stressed I got when I would get too high and fall 30 layers into thoughts that DON’T MATTER. Even now, thinking of myself then is annoying. And TBH, when I do see some friends high AF and saying/doing some dumb, nonsensical, have-to-be-high-for-it-to-be-funny type bs, it annoys me too. But also makes me glad I’m not getting dumb-high outta my mind anymore.

These may not be your reasons for quitting, but they were incredibly powerful in my defense against my own rose-colored thoughts. Bring me back down to reality I was trying to get high and escape from.

So if you’re on that same kinda track, where it’s not even fun anymore and you’re absolutely tired of yourself, just think of how much more confident you’ll feel moving forward, having taken control of your own brain. It’s your brain, make it work for you. Again, over some time, those thoughts won’t be loud enough to listen to anymore. Hope this helps someone!

Anyways, I've realised that every waking day i was consumed by getting home from work and getting baked asap, weekends were wake and bake with a cup of tea without fail.

Every morning I'd tell myself that I wanted to stop smoking, the anxiety/irritability and general lack of patience throughout my day was fueled by my habit and made me so much worse at life.

But, sure enough the final hour or so of my work would come around and all I could think of was getting indoors and lighting up. Then, more anxiety..struggling to keep my place tidy, laundry basket overflowing, dirty plates and cups all around the bedroom, failing to cook all the nice food I bought, throwing it in the bin and ordering uber eats...I sucked!

Each day was copy and paste though, I wanted to stop, but couldnt.

Every day of smoking for me was a re lapse every single day.

I am determined more than ever to stop for good this time and take back control of my life without a psychoactive chemical influencing my every decision and this sub helps me a lot just to read everyone's individual stories/feelings.

Hope anyone that's struggling can realise they're so much better off without.

In their relationships.
Their productivity levels.

I (M27) have quit weed after smoking for probably about 5 years total - with the last 2-3 years having been daily. I'm officially on day 3 which is the longest I can remember going without in a long time. 

I honestly did not expect the withdrawals to be this bad. My sleep has been terrible and I wake up many times in the night, alternating between freezing cold to sweating through my sheets. I'm constantly nauseous with little to no appetite, and quite often have a headache. My focus is really scattered and I'm having trouble motivating myself to do much of anything.

  
I'm trying to be kind to myself and remind myself that this is a process, but it's hard because part of the reason why I quit was I hoped it would make me less apathetic, and help me put in the effort and focus to find a new job in my field (I quit my job during the pandemic due to depression/anxiety that was probably exacerbated by marijuana). In my mind I didn't expect these withdrawals to be so debilitating, I thought I was just gonna quit and then just start studying and applying for jobs. Very naïve on my end - I'm just hoping these symptoms start to lessen soon.

I’ve been smoking weed since age 16 and taking mokes since 18  and now I’m 23. I have taken breaks to go on vacation or spend time with family, but I would always be thinking about taking a rip as soon as I got home. My bf easily quit a year ago but he smoked a lot less for a shorter time. I’ve always claimed that you can’t get addicted to weed and I rarely smoked cigs when I was drinking, so I never thought that smoking a couple lil pinches of tobacco a day would change that. But then I tried going back to smoking just weed and it wasn’t as good anymore.

On Monday I put the bong away and said I was going to stop for 2 weeks, but after my bf went to sleep I couldn’t shake the craving to take a rip. As soon as I did I felt so guilty. It made me realize that I’ve been lying to myself. Half the time I feel like shit after and I still kept taking mokes. So on Tuesday I had my bf put my bong and weed and cigs where I can’t reach, joined some subreddits for people quitting weed and tobacco, and downloaded the smoke free app. I’ve been doing well and resisting the cravings that come along. I’m proud of myself for not giving in even though it’s hasn’t even been a week.

However, I start a new job on Tuesday and I’m scared that being gone for 9 hours a day, working in a boring office job I don’t care about, will lead to me being unable to resist packing a bowl as soon as I get home in order to wind down. That’s what I was doing during my last job. I would think about it all day.

I know this page is for quitting weed, so I don’t know if quitting mokes applies or if you would consider me a part of your group. But I feel like I need support from people who understand how hard it is to quit when being a stoner was a part of your identity for years. I want to stop thinking about weed, stop being too lazy to go out and socialize, stop feeling like I need to hit the bong before eating.

I have trouble focusing whichever one task I have in front of me, and all I’m really doing is waiting for another excuse to hit the vape. 

I’m about to go work at a summer camp in a few days and I am planning to use this as an opportunity to quit. What I did not consider, however, was that if I quit concurrent with the very first day of camp, I’d be in withdrawal for the first two weeks (ish). 

So instead I’m quitting today, and keeping my fingers crossed that if I just push through these first few days before I’m back at camp, it’ll ease the pin of the withdrawal process once I’m up in the mountains. I hope the busy schedule of camp is also going to go toward taking my mind off my cravings and discomfort, but who knows. 

In any case, I’m making this post to hold myself accountable, and I’m also going to text my brother and let him know the same, so that he can hold me accountable too.

Felt uneasy coming into today. I had been holding on to a bit of weed from the beginning, almost as a taunt to the addiction. Today I worried that it would get the better of me. It had to go. 

I live near a school, so I wanted to get far away from the kids with this shit. I’ve been starting my days with a morning walk. I decided that I’d get rid of the canister of weed on my walk by going along a different path than usual. 

Before long, I ended up at a soccer field. I had this awesome post I was writing in my mind where I kicked the canister 45 yards and won the Super Bowl or something. When I actually kicked the canister on the field, though, it sort of flopped in the air a bit before hitting the turf with a damp thud. Metaphor for the weed experience itself, I guess. I then threw the canister away in a trash can full of dog crap, so that nobody would fish it out.

 I know it's bullshit. Every time I start it takes months to stop again and I quickly go from once a week to every day usage and I don't want to do it anymore. Aaargh!

I wanted to share my story of being 2 weeks nicotine and weed free.

I have been a daily weed smoker for the past 5 years with little or no breaks in between. Been super addicted to juuling for the past 3 years as well and decided to quit cold turkey.

As expected the withdrawals weren’t pleasant. Extreme fatigue, cold sweats, brain fog, irritation, loss of appetite and sex drive.

What got me through this was actually moving in with my family temporarily and that change of atmosphere and distraction really helped. The best thing I did was actually share my problem with my family which I understand isn’t feasible for majority of you but just having someone who will help you get through this is awesome.

It’s just been 2 weeks but I am confident I wouldn’t go back to that life. 

Stopping without this thought and not wanting to completely get away permanently was a major cause of relapses in the past.

Atleast with nicotine I believe it is more of a mental addiction and as far as pot is concerned I know I need to start getting used to doing everything sober which isn’t as easy as it sounds.

It’s not easy and definitely not impossible. Thanks to everyone on this group as being a lurker definitely helped and gave me motivation. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you need any help tackling this addiction.

I had been a marijuana user (particularly Hash) for about 12 and half years till March 2020. And then I decided to just let go, go cold turkey and never smoke one again. In these past 14 months I have not smoked anything, neither a joint nor a cigarette.

But now, I miss the feeling of me being relaxed after a day's hard work (I'm a researcher). Tbh, I really miss that feeling and taste of hash smoke going in and the high it gives almost instantly. I also feel that I would be able to really have control while consuming it (maybe keep it to 1 or 2 joints during the weekend), but I am not really sure about it.

I have had my share of withdrawal anxieties and depression, but I came out of it. Looking back at those moments, I feel I wouldn't have such an experience now and would be better off at having a joint or two once in a while.

Would appreciate other people sharing their similar experiences or what did they do in this situation.

Thanks! Peace Out!",2,0

181,2021-05-27 02:38:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nm1d2v/the_10000_question/,"The $10,000 Question","Hi all, 28 year old stoner with an 11 year smoking career which ( I hope) is now behind me. As of today I am 7 solid weeks clean, and not looking back. You might be wondering: aside from the wasted time, opportunities, potential, and life, what finally motivated me to give it up? How is quitting now any different than the nth times I have ""quit"" before?

Not much, really, other than this: I was chatting with my mom one day, and she made me an offer I couldn't refuse, ""Illustrious-Tone-875, you know how you don't want to keep smoking weed?""

""Yes...""

""And you know how *I* don't want you to keep smoking weed?""

""Yes...""

""Well, how about this: it takes me a year to save $10,000...if you can quit for one year, I am willing to gift you*-not loan you-*gift you a year's worth of my savings toward a down payment on your first home, what do you think?""

""...OK,...I might slip up though, but if I do-""

""No! This is a one shot deal for you. I want to see if you can prioritize anything other than smoking weed.""

That may have hurt to hear, but Goddamn it she's right. I've not really dealt with my life properly by reverting to weed to numb all my problems, so I haven't really grown up. The bottom line is this: her offer can essentially be rephrased as ""Can you stop smoking weed for a year for $10,000?"" and the answer is a resounding YES! I CAN stop smoking weed for what equates to $833.33/month for one full year, especially as an investment that gets me into the home-owning market (could you imagine being paid $10,000/year EVERY YEAR just to abstain from smoking weed?) I am 49 days in which makes me 13.42% of the way to accomplishing my goal and I could not be more proud; there is something out there for each and every one of you that is equally as motivating, but it takes work...

Although I have this to look forward to, I am learning to adjust to life after leaf...for the past decade I couldn't imagine life without it, I have gone a few weeks here, few months there, but otherwise I have been smoking joints, and bongs, pretty much every day solid for the past 11 years; I just could not believe that there are many people out there who have not and never will smoke weed, and they've managed just fine. 

I've been lucky to not only have such a selfless and relentlessly supportive mother, but I have also not had any compulsions or cravings to smoke (so far anyway), something kind of just clicked in my brain that I need to leave this shit in the ashtray and get on with life in light of the opportunity that I have been presented. I just can't afford to waste anything any longer.

Feel free to chat or ask any questions if you're curious, I'm open to making friends and supporting you in your journey to give this up! Good luck! :)",27,0
182,2021-05-27 02:18:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nm13ud/greetings_from_day_70/,Greetings from Day 70,"I see a lot of posts from the earlier days in the streak, so I'd like to share some thoughts about 2+ months into it. I think we all have different things we want to work on, and weed has had different effects on our personal journeys. That said, the biggest benefit to quitting was the joy of being able to follow through on something I'd struggled with for a long time. 

Succumbing to the addiction after I'd told myself ""that was the last one"", or being high when I was spending time with someone and having to keep it a secret that I was high...that stuff weighed heavily on me. Over a long period of time, the chronic shame and self-criticism I felt was as bad as the drug itself. I withdrew into myself, not wanting to converse or face the situation.

Successfully quitting not only rid me of the fog of weed, but also the feeling of letting myself down. The happiness and confidence I feel about following through on something that I wanted to do for myself, coupled with the clarity and freedom of not being high all the time, were definitely worth it for me. And yes, my skin is clearer, my sleep is more stable, my eyes are not glazed over, I'm far more energetic earlier in the day -- but you know all of this. You know exactly what you're missing out on when your skin's not great, your sleep is unstable, your eyes are glazed, you're tired in the morning. You know that you'd be happier at that moment if the stupid addiction was off your back.

That said, quitting is not a magic pill; life is a wonderfully complex journey and it would be lame if all it took was one simple habit to solve everything. So no, my life is still rich with joys and problems, but I'm far, far, far more engaged with it now than I was. I'm truly at a point where I'm not ashamed of my weed habits, because they were fun and I genuinely had some wonderful experiences, but I'm happy I moved onto the next chapter of young adulthood. 

To those contemplating, I'm sure you won't regret moving onto your next chapter, too :)",13,0

His heart isn't in quitting. He says he wants to have a break and smoke it occasionally like once a month or when it comes up but it doesn't happen. There was a breif one or two months he didn't smoke and he said he likes it and he was way more productive. And we didn't fight at all in that time.

(also some random thoughts and memories),"1 month 8 days after my 6 month relapse and I'm going through back to back ""hits"" for 8 days now. Essentially where my eyes turn bloodshot red and I get that weird ass body high I don't want and is not enjoyable at all. It stopped after 14 days but came back randomly. That's not abnormal to me as I've noticed the weed withdrawals for me is always an up or down thing. Feels like its' getting better than BOOM (and that happens until day 60 ish or so for me and then it actually starts getting ONLY better). Completely lost my appetite for 8 days now and lost a ton of weight too. 

I can't believe this happened from 2 months of smoking ""only"" 1g to 3.5g of 30% flower. Compared to what I was doing before I thought I wouldn't even have withdrawals more than 5 days. WRONG.  I was driving through the SOCAL canyons today and cars in front of me were smoking and the smell triggered a hit that's been lasting 10 hours now. Here are some random controversial thoughts I had today, take it as you will. I'm not saying these thoughts are true.. they're just thoughts.   


I started realizing today.. I probably never even smoked ""natural"" weed in my life. What the actual fuck is all this shit I've ever smoked? Aint no way ""natural"" Jamaican weed or something is God damn 30% THC sticky as hell... and what the FUCK is ""Cannabis extract"" ingredient in all the edibles I did from the dispensary? No seriously do we have a fucking clue? I mean they all have the same ingredients but they don't feel the same at all. Legally you can twist shit real easy. For example, the 100MG law in SOCAL where I live.. literally I'd use to have laughing conversations with bud tenders about how easy it was to get around them with like selling capsules or sublingual or tinctures. Technically capsules aren't an ""edible"" so the ABX ones easily come in 1000MG for 1 pill and such. So if you go around shit that easily in that sense, I wonder what else MIGHT be lurking in that ""Cannabis extract"".   


See I might be paranoid here but I literally Guinee pigged my self for the cause so why not share it? NOTHING ever made me as high as moon bars. I could make my own edibles perfectly with 1000 MG of oil perfectly decarbed with a nova decarboxylator but 1 moon bar would be stronger for me than chugging that entire oil (I know... disgusting fiend shit). 1000 MG ABX capsules would do nothing but 4 of those moon bars would atleast give me a buzz. I started thinking maybe it's the chocolate... so I'd buy other brands of chocolate.. NOPE. I also find the ""Pesticide"" lab tests a fucking joke because obviously it's their own paid and bought out labs. Don't doubt I smoked fucking cyanide sprayed weed before from a dispensary lol.. Idfk... best not to think about it now lol.. Just mind is blown from how unregulated this shit is and how it's a laughing stock to the people in business because they know how stupid the regulators are. One time I literally went to a ""legal"" dispensary posted on yelp and google @ 12 AM (how can that be legal when 10 PM is the legal time?)... it was a dude's HOUSE... literally a person's house turned into the shadiest fucking dispensary. 

Any who a little bit of PTSD about day 50 since usually that day hits me mad hard with the maximum amount of withdrawals before stuff gets better. A bit overwhelmed rn I guess so I decided to make this post to get some stuff off my chest to feel better. I really wish I'd get out of this hit for at least a few hours but man...

It was great and I didn’t think their were any long lasting downsides. 

For the last 3-4 years I’ve been a binge smoker (will smoke everyday for a few weeks and then have a break for a few weeks, lose some of the munchie weight, recover some money and repeat) each time I’d have a break the withdrawals would slowly get worst however. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression previously and it’s only been recently that I’ve learned that for people with preexisting anxiety and depression, weed is a no go.

I’m about 6 months sober (minus a week long binge in there) and I just feel so fragile. My resilience to weather life’s downs is lower than ever. When I think back and compare myself emotionally to who I was in my mid to late 20’s, I feel like I’ve regressed, gone backwards. I feel like a teenager...

I probably feel the lowest and most hopeless and pessimistic about life than I ever had and the only thing that I can attribute it too is the slow slide down into weed dependency.

After my last failure where I made it past 4 months without smoking, I started by convincing myself if I could  make it that long, then that means I can control it and I’ll be fine with an occasional bowl. I started slow and steady, keeping track of dosing and having complete control. Then, 7 months went by in the blink of an eye. I found myself re-upping my high every 3-4 hours if I could. Vaping where it was inappropriate. 

My life started cracking apart. I had a good job that I was no longer happy with, I had a great girlfriend I wasn’t being attentive to, I had a beautiful car that was wrecked (call it act of God), I had a bank account  balance larger than I’d ever had before. So many things I had going for me I either lost or threw away.

Listening to myself when I said I could control it. Those were lies and I fell for them.

I was distraught and felt more alone than I’d ever been. For a month I didn’t tell anyone about losing my girlfriend, I could hardly believe it myself, we were about to start our 8th year together. I don’t believe I hit rock bottom,  but I knew then I had to start taking accountability for my behaviors, my habits, my attitude toward living, and the lies and excuses I’ve been so comfortable living with. 

On day 1 I told myself no more excuses no more bs.

I made a promise to myself, and while I was skeptical of me making promises because of my “self dishonesty” I decided I wasn’t going to look back, only forward.

In order to do that I practiced acceptance of what is and what was. I accept it all.

Then I practiced gratitude, I’ve still got so much going for me, I am thankful for everything I have.

Positive attitude. No matter how bad things get, better days are ahead. The tough outlast the tough days. When I’m especially somber, I remember to put it into perspective, I reflect on history, things like the Holocaust, WWII, trench warfare, chemical warfare. How back then there were teenagers to 30 year olds who had it infinitely worse than I could imagine. There isn’t a better time to keep positive than right now.",7,0

Not less than an hour later I thought about how some weed would make the weather even nicer with no qualms about the thought. As if I’ve not been desperate to quit for years now. My decision was made. 
I got high and ran into someone from high school while in public where the most awkward interaction possible ensued. I felt like such an idiot. I hate feeling weird and guilty in public. Like everyone knows I’m high. I ended up calling out of work because I was too paranoid my coworkers would know. It’s a new job that I love and that I was excited to go to earlier today. 
Why the fuck do I keep self sabotaging?? I haven’t enjoyed being high in years. Maybe a fleeting moment when I’m alone and in the sun. But it’s NEVER worth it. I feel like I don’t have anyone in real life to support me through this (aside from my therapist) 
Every time I try to talk about the extent of my addiction with my friends it comes off as nonchalant, exaggerated, or somewhat sarcastic. I really struggle with being candid and vulnerable and asking for help and I’ve always been seen as the funny and independent stoner girl who doesn’t take much too seriously; it feels like everyone in my life wants me to stay as that person. The only friends of mine who I can candidly talk about my addiction with are the ones who are just as addicted— usually we’ll talk about our addictions during a smoke sesh. “Oh well” is how the convo is framed. “Whatcha gonna do?” Most of those guys I don’t even care to be around much if it weren’t for the weed.

I’ve had the urge to smoke more days than not. One thing that keeps me from smoking is having to quit all over again. All the progress I’ve made would be wiped out. 


I started smoking weed every day 12 years ago; the same day I quit smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. There have been a few times since then where I have had a few weeks of sobriety, such as my trips to Japan and China where weed is inaccessible for the most part. 

I quit smoking weed because I don’t want to numb my physical pain or emotions anymore. I wanted to actually feel. And now that I can actually feel, part of me wants to stop feeling again because it is so intense sometimes. 

I haven’t experienced full on sobriety for my entire adult life. A lot of the emotions I’ve been feeling seem new and unfamiliar and have been extremely difficult to deal with. In addition to my local support groups like my friends and family, this community often helps guide those difficult times.

Now, I don't think about weed all that much. I don't get that urge to grab the bong. 

I have gotten a couple of withdrawal headaches but I crushed them quickly with some Advil. The vivid dreams have started to kick in around day 10. So vivid that they are abruptly waking me up. On top of that, I have sleep apnea, so... it's been a bit of a struggle lol!

I go back home in 5 days to my girlfriend who is a daily smoker, so I'm interested to see what happens there. She supports any decision I make, but I guess I'll just have to see. Right now, I have no interest in it. I've made it this far and I want to hold out longer to see and feel the effects of being off weed for months on end.

Overall, quitting right now has been a blessing and a curse. I'm here in Iceland for work and have never felt this amount of stress before. Adding on the side effects of quitting weed has made my time here much more difficult, but I couldn't imagine a better time to quit than being stuck on an island far from home with no weed in sight.",6,0

I’m 21 years old started smoking at 18 and am currently 6 months sober. I had to leave my friend group, in mid February because one I felt they didn’t respect me enough and I was the butt-end of a lot of jokes and two it got to a point where they turned from high school pals into smoking buddies, which is not a healthy transition. 

I use to think back when we could hangout without the enhancement of cannabis and have a good time. I was never great at making friends and have dealt with social anxiety, so even when I felt gradually they were treating me worse, weed would be the crutch that would make me feel okay. After some incidents at home and knowing I had an addiction I decided it was time to quit. I would still talk to my old friend group, over our ps4 party chat and they knew I was trying to quit, but weed was the main topic of conversation because one of my buddies was the hookup. 

Through sobriety I realized I needed time to myself as a reset, my friends respected the decision. I’m not gonna lie it can get lonely sometimes, not talking to people my age, but I’ve been working on myself, I whether it’s fitness, my career or my social anxiety and will come out of this pandemic better than ever and make better better relationships that just don’t rely on a vice. I also quit video games because they were a time waster. Most important thing I’ve learned as someone who always got influenced by others, is to figure out your values and what’s important to you. Cause you’ll never figure out your purpose or be happy if your just band-aiding your emotions with a crutch and listening to others or society.

TLDR: old friends turned into smoking buddies. Had to figure out my true values.",22,1

It was so hard in the beginning and I failed many times before I succeeded but I have passed the point of no return and do not crave nor think of it at all. 

What helped me succeed:

-This forum helped me not feel so alone. Many people dismiss the idea of quitting weed like it’s no big deal to smoke every day (someone actually commented that on my FB celebratory post today 🙄) so having an understanding community REALLY helped. I read the forums daily.

-One of my closest friends was / is also sober and very encouraging and I’d text her when I wanted to use and she’d cheer me on and remind me why I wanted to quit 

-I had to deal with the reasons why I was numbing. I was in emotional pain, I hated my life, I didn’t want to deal, I was afraid those painful emotions would hurt me too much and I was afraid. 

-I used my favorite tool in the whole world to deal with my painful feelings: EFT Tapping. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system so it keeps you in a state of calm while you allow the scary feelings to come out and it processes them out of the body. Feelings are energy in motion and EFT is an energy tool (like acupressure, cousin to acupuncture) and it helps facilitate the release and process. 

-I let myself grieve it. It was my best friend for 10 years. I let myself be sad without judgement.

-I created a new vision for my life and what I wanted it to be. I broke it down into steps. I did affirmations, I told myself it was possible, I broke through limiting beliefs (with journaling and EFT)

-I delayed using. If I wanted to, I’d tell myself I would if I still wanted it in an hour. Usually an hour later I didn’t. But if I did I would tell myself, I made it an hour, let me just try another one. And so on. 

Today I am happy, healthy, in a completely different place, have Up leveled my life, am the most confident in myself I’ve ever been, productive, building happy healthy relationships, building a fulfilling business helping people and am living my passions. I’m a completely different person and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. 

If I can do it, you can too!!!!!

Just once every two weeks or so with my friends. I was already a really happy guy sober, so weed made me very, very euphoric. Eventually it turned into once a week. Then a few times a week. Eventually it would turn into everyday, but that came a lot later.

Anyways, weed became a problem for me pretty early on. I'm not sure when exactly it began, but I remember when I noticed it. It was a summer day with my friends. I had smoked the night prior. we were out somewhere beautiful, and I felt very numb for some reason. This feeling would not go away (even after weeks of abstinence from weed) until I smoked again, and so very quickly, weed became my escape.

Many people smoke weed and go back to normal once it's out of their system. I didn't (and still don't) understand why smoking weed occasionally effects me so drastically and for so long afterwards, but it just does. My father was an addict. Maybe that's why. Anyways, as soon as I'd begin to feel better, I'd smoke weed and set myself back. Each time the anhedonia would get worse.

Tried a few things over the years. One of them worked, I could feel pleasure again. Smoked weed one night. Numb feeling returned the following morning. Never went away after that, it only got worse.

During the pandemic, weed stopped helping me. Even still, I was smoking 3-4 times a day. I don't know why. It made me feel sad. Tried quitting probably 5-6 times and failed every time. Yesterday I decided to take it serious. I gave away all my stuff. My weed, vape, jars, papers, lighters, grinders, everything. Made my friends promise not to let me smoke with them for the rest of the year. I hate who I am right now. I hate this version of me who uses this drug. I don't want to forget that, Even after 2 months, or 4, or 6. I just want this to be over. I don't need this thing anymore, it's time to move on.",9,1

Pretty much made it through undergrad stoned. Engineering school made me mentally sick, so I resorted to weed to get by. My first demise was recognizing I was “able” to study and do my homework stoned. I did get through, and I graduated. 

I thought in the working world, my habits would naturally reside. But in a virtual world, I am able to do as I please. And I had no self control. 

Currently, I’m only on day 2, but I feel this break will be different. I believe it would be best for me to stop forever, but I’m viewing it as a break right until I’m able to process a life without something that was so integrated in my life. 

First of all, everyone here, whether posting or commenting, is amazing. Thank you for supporting and contributing to a group that really needs each other. 

I felt even motivated to post in here after reading and being able to wholeheartedly relate to so many posts. Yall got this. 

My mind knows every facet of my life will improve without weed. But my body doesn’t know yet. So I’m nervous for the next few weeks, but truly freaking excited to see how my life improves due to quitting. 

I hope one day the thought of it doesn’t even cross my mind, and instead, I’m full of sober thoughts backed by love, positivity, and good. I hope one day I’m not on auto-pilot, relying on a substance to get me through every minute of every day, and instead, my days are full of challenging myself mentally and physically to be better.

It’s been a long slog through the nausea, insomnia, lack of appetite, anxiety, etc, etc, etc. These symptoms are mostly gone now, and I’m digging into big home organizing projects to keep my hands and mind from being idle (and feeling great accomplishment from it!).

The mental health symptoms keep piling up however and I feel like I “can’t get a break” anymore… 

This weekend though my mind started playing tricks on me.. I got my first thought of “you did it, you’re free from the chokehold of pot! Let’s celebrate with just a little pot!”  It persisted all weekend, and into this week now. I’m working so hard I can barely move at the end of the day, but the feeling keeps coming back… 

Add that to the “need” for some release when things get so stressful, I keep coming back to just want a smoke… just a single smoke to make this go away even just for a minute. 

I’m so happy to be through the worst parts of withdrawal so far, but I need a little help with staying this way.

Wow this is tough.  Within the past few months I switched from using the bong to vaping with a Mighty, weed was always on my mind.

Wake up for work, hit the bong.  Come home from work, smoke for the rest of the evening.  Weed was one of the first things on my mind when I woke up, and priority #1 when getting home (apart from my wonderful other half of course)

Not only is it costing me money I could be saving, it's causing me to just tune into autopilot and relive the same day, every day.

I finally decided enough is enough, and when we went dankrupt on Sunday, we refused to get more.  Having a weed free house is very alien to me.

I need some tips and motivation to ensure I can stay on this path.  I am currently transferring my daily spending on weed into a savings account to help me understand how quickly it adds up.

So first things first the first week after 4 years of daily 1.5g-2.5g a day smoking 10-20 hits all day everyday was definitely hard. To say the least. 

I'd grown so accustomed to ""oh I'm bored I better smoke"" and ""smoking can make this better"" that I didnt even know what normal was anymore. 

For some context I'm 23 (24 in july) and I've smoked daily since 19 so I've been smoking for nearly 5 years and even before daily I'd light up occasionally with my cousins who have smoked alot longer than myself. 

Here's where things get eery. One of My cousins suffered a collapsed lung a few weeks ago. And the other now has chronic smokers cough. I started noticing my breathing getting shit and I had a noticeable wheeze and phlegm and cough. I've also had asthma and aspergers and severe anxiety and depression forever and since I broke my nose in child hood I also have a deviated septum that cause post nasal drip.

I used Weed to cope with a frustrating reality. A dad who abused me as a child. A family who felt distant. And eventually went down a dark path... And.. well.. it wasn't worth it friends...

Last year in July I gave up blunts since I exclusively smoked tobacco in blunt form.

Then 9 days ago after a hit that took the wind outta me causing coughing all day and wheezing like never before, I freaked out and called my doctor booked an urgent care appointment and got him to check me with a stethoscope and got an xray and everything showed up as ok to me relief, but I couldn't shake the feeling of self pitty and fear and anxiety and depression. I begged God to help me and I know some of you might think what will that do, but it really did help me to trust a higher power wants Me safe and healthy, and just to be safe I booked a follow up Dr Appointment for this Friday. Since As a reasonable person I trust in both God and Modern Medicine... that day I said tomorrow will be different and threw everything I had Weed related into the trash except for lighters since I enjoy candles.

I lost my job due to being high all the time and not coming in.

My parents allowed me to visit them daily during this to help me combat my anxiety. Which showed me Weed was giving me paranoia and ruining my relationship with them.

Immediately on day 1 of no smoke my cough and wheeze and phlegm grew worse and I was terrified I'd given myself a chronic disease... I called my doctor who prescribed me Inhalers and anxiety meds to help.

On day 2 It felt a little easier to breath but I was still wheezing and coughing up clear phlegm with occasionally having black gunk in it. But I could tell I was getting better.

By day 3 I had an itch in my lungs and throat it was weird it felt like my lungs were gurgling and I was coughing alot. So I decided to take up walking since some people here recommend physical activity. I'm well overweight and pushed myself too far and ran a few houses back and forth by the end of which I felt tired and tasted iron in my mouth. I decided ""tomorrow I'll try walking instead of running""

On day 4 I couldn't hear the wheeze when I woke up and my coughing was more comfortable but I still had alot of phlegm, I walked for 55 minutes from my home to my parents to visit this day. I never did that before... I felt so proud of myself. Even though mentally I still felt high and like I wanted a smoke I felt a since of calm and clarity.

Day 5 was hard. Really hard. I felt shortness of breath for the first time in my entire life even having asthma, since its very mild. It was traumatic. I thought this was it. This is my day to say goodbye... even the inhalers and anxiety meds only helped minimally. So I scoured this reddit and tried to make myself feel better knowing others go through the same. I slept that night in fear. And had nightmares that I frequently woke up from.

On day 6 it was a little easier to breath but the shortness of breath stayed and I cried in fear. Fear that I was 23 years old and I might never live normal again. Might have to have my family bury me. Fear that this was all for nothing. But sometimes like in this, a storm comes before the rainbow. I spoke to my Christian strict dad for the first time in years without having him tell me rude things or hurt me mentally, instead he encouraged me, told me he loves me, and said it'd be OK. My father the person I expected the least to give a crap made me feel alright, like it wasn't the end but only the beginning. With a new spring in my step I took the streets and began walking every day for at least 30 mins starting this day.

Day 7 the shortness of breath was barely noticeable and although the coughing was still there it was much easier to deal with and much less frequent. I am still using my orange Inhaler twice daily but I don't need the blue one as much now. I also went and got my first covid shot this day with my family (ended up with arm pain and feeling tired lol) I also started trying meditation today to help with stress and anxiety and mental clarity.

Day 8 ""today"" I woke up feeling tired but also restless. I can barely notice the wheeze now and the cough is substantially better, my mental state is still kind of high and cloudy but I feel much more clear than on day 1. My lungs still feel gurgly occasionally but it's rare now and I hope it stays that way and even if it doesn't I know it'll get better, and I'm proud to say despite having gone for a 35 minute walk today I've not once used the blue rescue Inhaler today yet. I still also feel scared and anxious about the future of my health and my recovery but I haven't wanted to smoke since day 4 now. And I've got veins showing up on my hands and wrists and my neck and shoulders seem to be more pronounced. And I haven't taken the anxiety med today either. I was also getting wrinkles due to smoking even tho I'm 23 but they look much less pronounced already after only 8 days.

I keep telling myself

I know I have a long road ahead of me still.
I know this is just the start of my journey. 
I know it's not gonna be easy and at times it might actually get more difficult.
But I know everything is gonna be OK.

I feel a renewed connection to my family. 
I feel more emotional and loved than I ever did on weed.
I feel cleaner than I have in years.

There's a million other things I'd like to say, but for now let's leave it here.

Stay safe and clean friends. I'll update at 30 days.

TL;DR: 
After only 8 days I feel cleaner and happier than I ever did on weed.
The drug controlled me, and for the first time in my life I'm in control and that feels amazing.
I have a renewed sense of emotions and love and trust.

Been high for so many years I'm wondering if this is just my personality and I'll have to accept it.

My tolerance for bs, annoyance, even touch sometimes, unwanted noises, people talking to me when I'm busy, friends complaining, etc. Is so very slim. 

Some days are better than others but the fuse is real short.

Somehow I'm find it humorous anyway, part of me is remembering my personality being this way before, but it's hard to tell.

By grumpy I don't even mean unwilling to do things or grouchy. I mean easily annoyed and irritated, and overall just very serious. I feel like a computer.

With that being said, day 55 guys!!! I'm as proud as can be given my mood. Never want to go back and would take this mood permanently over ever being high again.",8,0

Looking for some reassurance I guess.","Hey all, kind of a rambling post about my recent experience quitting weed, looking for anyone who can relate to share some tips or just support I guess.

I'm a 38 yo dude, and I stopped smoking mid-March (totally sober). I was having multiple dabs a day and been a constant smoker in one way or another for about 20 years. I was of the opinion that everything was better stoned, and never really developed many hobbies outside of watching movies, listening to music and occasional gaming. Chilling out with friends and smoking was probably my #1 thing to do. I'm self employed, and my work isn't too complicated (landscaping), so I can enjoy a decent amount of personal freedom with regards to how I spend my time, and this was making is easy to be stoned most of the time.

I have 2 kids (5 and 9), and I realized my drug use wasn’t allowing me to fully enjoy being a dad, and also I wasn't accomplishing anything I was ambitious about. My interest in anything was always ""weed first"". I had the realization as I was laying on the couch baked and browsing reddit, watching my son play Lego, that I should be craving playing with him, instead of feeling like kid interaction was ""work"". Like, playing with my kids should be the thing I'm craving, rather than weed and mindless redditing, and I should ""want"" it, first and foremost. So I decided I would remove the weed, in the hope that getting rid of the ""easy satisfaction"" the drug provides, would inspire my brain to seek other more ""real"" sources of contentment.

Upon quitting, I had some significant withdrawal in the form of heavy night sweats and chills, which really surprised me, as I figured weed was never that big of a deal on my body. But that passed in about 2 weeks, and I was feeling quite good, and proud of my achievement. I was telling anyone who would listen about how the sober life is better, and how the drugs just cloud your experience and don't really add anything meaningful. Hanging out with friends, who smoke, was not a problem at all, surprisingly. I was able to hang, and enjoy myself just as much, if not more without pot. I was ""up"", and started my season of work in mid-April feeling motivated, confidant and energized. Music sounded better, I was doing the exercise and healthy diet stuff, laughing more, crying more, generally, I gave a shit more about life.

Now, however, I am having a difficult time finding enjoyment in anything. I feel numb and hopeless in some way. I spend my day thinking about what to do for fun, and have trouble finding it. The comedy podcasts and music which previously carried me through my day seem dull and uninteresting. My mind is constantly thinking about what I could/should be doing, and contentment is hard to find. Tough to get out of bed and look forward to the day.

My kids are my #1 focus in life. I don't have any grand ambitions (though I constantly search for something to look forward to), like retirement plans, vacation, etc. I know I need to find something to sink into, like a good hobby, tv show, sport (tough with all the covid bullshit), but I keep coming to ""what's the point?"", and do nothing new. I try to fill my time with family activity, which is satisfying, but I also need to find something I can latch onto which is just mine, and I can do by myself.

Getting sober has also exposed the things in life that I am not satisfied with, but have been ignoring for a long time, such as my lack of contentment in my job (I feel I should do something more in line with my intelligence rather than a labor-centric profession, I mean I do have a University degree. Also, my body won't be able to keep up forever. But this is easy and pays decent), my Marriage (my wife is caring and supportive and a great mom, but I feel we don't share a lot of interests in common. Tough to find things to do together, without the kids), My compulsiveness (now eating, and coffee), and my health (I have neglected my body for a while and it's not getting any younger).

My life isn't bad, I have a great family, my income is satisfactory, and I am generally healthy. But I feel like a loser. I lack an identity without drugs, as a result of only having an identity as a drug user for so long. I am also becoming a worse partner to my wife, complaining about how I'm depressed, or what I feel she's not doing right, rather than having fun times with her.

I know in my heart that it is better to be sober, and to experience the lows, and the issues, so they can point me in the directions I need to concentrate on and repair. I also know that being sober is the best I can do for my kids, being a good role model. But my mind seems stuck wallowing in thoughts of ""I'm not having fun"", ""nothings worth doing"", ""I have no one to relate to"", ""what's the point?"", ""what am I living for?"". I find myself thinking that going back to smoking weed would at least provide me the ability to be content, and pleasantly ignorant. I also know that I was in quite high spirits not too long ago, and feeling really good about these sober decisions.

Is this depressed, no fun mind state a common occurrence at this point in the sobriety journey? Or is this the new normal? Should I try to ride it out and stay on the sober path, or am I better off just enjoying the happiness that weed provides, and trying to be content, rather than optimal? Can I get back that positivity I was feeling about a month ago?

Will things be fun again?

Is this common? Are withdrawal symptoms supposed to come in attacks? I feel like most of what I read describes them like slowly building in intensity, reaching a critical point and then slowly decreasing again over the course of 2 weeks - 2 months.

She told me it was heartburn so i stuck to a cleaner diet. Eating a small breakfast, a light lunch, and just chicken or fish with broccoli for dinner. Fast forward 2 weeks and my symptoms persist, I started taking omeprazole but the heartburn is still there and it gets so bad that i can’t even sleep and i feel constantly nauseous, and worst of all it’s affected my breathing. I feel like my throat is excessively dry or like if my lungs are closing. I try coughing, but nothing comes up and no relief, I take a deep breath and when i exhale i can hear myself wheezing, and at that point i just sit still, breathe and wait for the heartburn to pass.

I went to fold a blanket that I was given as a Christmas gift from my older sister whom I love very dearly. It’s one of those blankets knitted together with a design on one side and a color on the other. There’s a bunch of soccer balls on one side because that was my passion growing up.

I started using very heavily in college and lost touch with my hobbies, interests, and myself in general. This led me to start hiding from the world and myself without me being fully aware of it. I would always fold the blanket so that only the red side would show instead of the side that actually reflected a part of me.

While I was cleaning up yesterday I instinctively folded it to show the color side of the blanket.  My sobriety allowed me to really remember where this instinctual choice stemmed from. I just bursted out in quite the unsavory sob.

It felt so sad, beautiful, and cathartic simultaneously.  If I were still using daily, I doubt I could have made this connection with myself, and even if I did I would feel numb and shrug it off and smoke my next bowl.

I love sobriety, I love my feelings, I love my thoughts, and I love being interested in academia, my environment, and the people that I love and care for.

I've always been a fan of weed as a naughty teenager, meaning that I liked to hang out with people who smoke it a lot, I puffed a bit and never imagined being addicted.

Since my early twenties though, I moved to a town I don't like, into a flat on my own, which I hated, studied a course at a private college (I'm in Europe, that move comes across as spoiled, like my parents bought me my degree, which isn't true, but tbf, it felt easy, undemanding and phony compared to a public college), became really bitter, got myself a lot of weed and I haven't in any meaningful way had to leave my bed since that. 
As I convinced myself that this town is too boring and unworldly for me, I never really tried to make friends. 

So I've been on my own, smoking weed all day for more than four years now. 
Since yesterday I don't have any weed left, my dealer doesn't reply and I don't know what to do with myself. I tried to drink wine last night, but I didn't like it. I wish I found a way out of this. because I know that when my dealer calls again, I'll meet him. But what I want more than anything is a group of friends.

Many times, I have had the feeling that it would help me boost my artistic and creative side. In the virgin days when I first started to smoke, it might have been slightly relevant. But as time went on, it seems that no productivity ever came out from it in the end run. Being high, I came up with all sorts of creative and fun ideas, I planned many projects in my head. When I wasn't high, I kept thinking that I would just need some weed to get started with some creative projects and be productive. Basically nothing ever turned out to be more than just thoughts and ideas. 

Now that I am completely sober, I am so much more productive. I feel the flow of playing guitar and producing music much more stronger now. I have recorded things, completed projects and I can feel the progress in completely different ways. Even started writing and painting a lot, and now I see so many results (many completed paintings, songs and works). In many ways I feel that I am much better at what I do when I'm not high anymore.

I don’t have excuses. I don’t work. I’m currently not studying. I get money from the government because the reason I’m not studying is because I’m having surgery (the only excuse I could possible offer, as to why I’m struggling, is that I have Endometriosis, and often suffer from intense abdominal pain, but if I’m real, I use it as an excuse to myself to feel less useless).

I've had a few months off here and there but generally have been smoking at least a few bowls for the last 14, almost 15 years. This last year I've tried to quit a few times, the most I've made it was one month. I've reached my rock bottom, credit cards are maxed, car is slowly breaking down, I owe money to the IRS, student loans, and credit cards/banks. I think about killing myself daily, which I won't do, but the thoughts come up frequently mostly due to my financial situation, but also due to weed withdrawal. To top it all off, I'm actually a mental health worker and so feeling this way and being in this situation makes me feel like I shouldn't be trying to help other people because I can't take care of my own shit. In all honesty, I'm actually good at my job and working with people, but have always done that by going home and smoking weed after work. Anyways, I'm done with weed, it's left me complacent and while it's definitely not the sole reason I'm in this situation, it is a contributing factor. Today at work I was working with a family and I started sweating so much. At the end of the session my shirt was almost soaked through with sweat smelling like weed. I went to the bathroom feeling absolutely disgusted with myself. I didn't go into full panic attack mode, but I could feel one coming on, I grounded myself and then drove home. I don't know if I'll make rent this month, I'm just hoping the IRS doesn't come for collections, and same with the banks. I'm so mad at myself for putting myself in this situation. I'm not in a good place, but I'm still thankful for this community. I've been loving the leaves discord group as well as talking with a few people here who I have been messaging with. I am hopeful things will get better, but definitely feel like I'm at my rock bottom, or about to really see rock bottom. Reading everyone else's experiences here has helped me and I wanted to say thank you for that while I go through this. Writing this out helped a little and I'm just going to post it in hopes that it well help someone else to read it. We can do this together, but fuck, this, and life, is hard.",9,0

In 2017 my father went to prison for sexually abusing my 2 sisters. I was 17. Him and I were so close, he got me into music at a very young age and was so supportive of me. Being my only parent after my mother committed suicide in 04 I always was so scared of losing the only
parent I had. Weed covered my pain. It made me feel like I could function again somewhat. It made me not constantly think about how my father betrayed me and my sisters. I have been diagnosed with ptsd and major depression and that was my medicine. Actual meds made me too numb I was a zombie while I was on them. So here I am Day 5 raw dogging this mental illness also day 9 of quitting nicotine because I just so happened to develop a wonderful stomach issue pretty sure it’s an ulcer because an endoscopy is the only thing they’ve yet to do.

Currently on day 3 after a month long relapse (a month sober prior to that). My withdrawal symptoms are bad but what's worse are the emotional symptoms. I've been feeling very alone and weak, but I know I need to keep going.

I think my Marijuana usage has resulted in possibly nerve damage and some mild psychosis. I have twitches and tremors all over my body and I catch myself in some really strange and paranoid thoughts. 

What's making this really hard though is I'm giving weed up more out of necessity rather than an active desire to quit. I'm incredibly self destructive and I also just enjoyed being high. A huge part of me never wanted to loosen my grip on weed. Sorry for randomly dumping a bit of my story into this post.

Back to the main point here, I very much am an addict and I have big issues holding myself accountable. I live alone with a very limited social life and I don't really have anyone to talk to about all this that gets it. I'm also an atheist (sometimes agnostic, depends on if I want something to pray to lol). 

Would Marijuana anonymous be helpful for someone like me? I have severe social anxiety, not sure how much I would participate. I also can't see myself following the 12 steps or anything like that, so i wasn't sure if it was worth the time for me. It pains me to admit it but I think I really do need help.

Here's how my addiction to Marijuana almost destroyed my life, and why quitting was the best thing I could've possibly done for myself.","To give a bit of background, I am 18 years old and I finished high school last year. I have been smoking weed on a daily basis since last year, and just before I quit four days ago I was burning through 1/2 ounce per week. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, and throughout the course of my addiction I had been lying to myself that weed was helping me cope with these issues.

Although I haven't been using Marijuana for as long as a lot of others on here, my life quickly spiralled downwards as my addiction worsened. I stopped putting effort into my relationships with friends and family and started to avoid spending time with my girlfriend, as she was strongly against my usage and I relied on it to sleep, which meant that whenever I would spend the night at her house I would be up alone for hours, unable to sleep, just longing to go home so I could get high and knock myself out. I didn't end up continuing my education and ended up failing my final year of school because all I wanted to do was get high.

I became extremely lazy, and had no motivation to do anything. I barely ever left the house and would play video games all day while taking hits from my vaporiser and bong. I have always been quite skinny, but I lost so much weight in those last few months that my rib cage and spine are clearly visible. A couple of days before the breakup I was almost certain I experienced some form of psychosis after irresponsibly consuming too much AVB. Going to sleep that night, I can recall my body and face twitching uncontrollably. I was completely manic up until around yesterday, and I'm still not feeling myself at all. I became very paranoid about everything, and accused my girlfriend of doing some really awful things. I saw a couple of friends yesterday who thought I was on something else because my pupils have been so dilated.

Due to my avoidance and overall just completely strange behaviour, my now ex recently asked me if I still wanted to be with her, to which I basically replied no. I couldn't even tell if I loved her because I was high all the time, and now that I have been sober for a couple of days I realised how much she meant to me and just how horribly I had been treating her for the past few months. Ever since that night I have been unable to smoke, as I would launch into a massive panic attack whenever I would try to. I have an appointment next week with a psychiatrist who will determine whether or not I have developed some sort of cannabis induced mental illness, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is all just down to the amount of stress I have been experiencing recently (I quit vaping 60mg salt nicotine just over two weeks ago which has been very challenging for me.

I am lucky to have very supportive parents who have been taking me out places to keep myself distracted. I wasn't sure how they'd react when I told them just how much I had been consuming and the insane amount of money I had been spending on it.

I've been dealing with some pretty serious withdrawals. The nightmares have been so bad that I dread going to sleep every night and have been sweating buckets ever since I stopped, but I've been trying to view this in a positive light as it means that all of those chemicals are leaving my body.

Although it feels as if my life has collapsed, I am very proud of myself for being able to make these lifestyle changes. I have been taking long walks every day and I plan on signing up to the gym again this week. By the end of the year I hope to have some insight about what career path I wish to take, but for now I need to focus on sorting my life out.

I wish all of you the best of luck on your journey to recovery, and if any of you are struggling, please feel free to send me a message.",26,0
262,2021-05-25 20:14:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nl3tby/gratitude/,Gratitude,"I've been sober for 345 days after a 20+ year daily run. Bongs, joints, cookies, knives, drinking the pro-weed kool-aid by the gallon. It wasn't easy in the beginning. Focus was set on the life I wanted to build, not on the life that part of my brain felt I was leaving behind. The reality is what I was leaving behind was something I didn't want anymore. Eventually I started having gratitude for my new life. Gratitude that I was no longer struggling nearly as much mentally. Gratitude for the new found mental clarity and mental and physical energy I've found in mid-life with the help of sobriety. Gratitude for no longer carrying around the baggage of addiction, regrets and guilt. 

It took quite a few attempts, more than I could keep track of but probably more than a dozen semi-serious attempts over those 20 years. Looking back, thats all they were, semi-serious. Part of me wanted to stop but part of me did not. It wasn't until I was fully, wholly and truly entirely onboard with stopping that I finally made some real changes in my life. I know addiction will be with me always and I am okay with that. It took accepting living life as a sober person to get where I am today. Sure those times were fun and I enjoyed that escape. A realistic evaluation of the price associated with that method of recreation leaves a pretty clear result. I wish I could tell you what changed specifically within me to get this far but I can't. I just know it came from effort, a lot of effort, a lot of introspection, a lot of practice through trial and error, some significant life crises and reaching a point of wanting change.

It’s been almost 5 years since I’ve started smoking weed daily. I started smoking with my friends in my senior year of HS. But after I moved to college, my friends disappeared but my weed usage didn’t. I would prefer to stay at my apartment and smoke by myself instead of going out, smoke before doing any activity, or smoke because I was feeling depressed. If it wasn’t for classes (which I attended high) I would’ve spent all my days smoking in my room by myself.

I feel like I wasted my college career and had so many missed opportunities to meet new people, get internships, and be a better me. I’ve lost so many friends and relationships due to weed and at the time I didn’t care because I preferred to have weed over friends, but now that I’ve graduated college, I regret it all. It sucks knowing that the reason why I feel alone, depressed, and unwanted is because I pushed everyone way due to smoking, and the most painful part is that I can’t go back in time to change my habit.
COVID also hit me hard to because being inside all day just lead to me smoking even more and made me unproductive. It was apart of my daily routine that I couldn’t break. 

Today is Day One for me and I needed to put my feelings in words somewhere and the only place I found was this community. I wish I had friends to tell my problems to but I am glad that this community is so supportive. I feel so short tempered, easily irritated, and have no motivation to do anything.

In this new found sobriety im gaining nothing but clarity, sure some of the issues that weed has solved for me have re-surfaced but ultimately theyre problems that are now mine to fix without the distraction of every day marijuana usage. 

I look to the past year of using pot on a daily basis as a ""de-stresser"" after work but in the reality it just allowed me to spend what little income Ive had in lieu of more smoke which had settled off any growing issues (financially, mentally, also physically) as more than okay in my world when in reality its been far from the opposite. 

420 was my last day and im over a month yet again but this time it feels more real than ever. Ive been congratulated and my success has been turned into that of a victory so far but the road is long ahead. 

Sure by all means its a great recreation alternative to alcohol and other substances but not as an every day sedative. If anyone out there is struggling to really lend off or find someone to support their decision to quit feel free to reach out to me on here in reply or even DM.

To those who post about getting through 1 day and 2 days, that is huge effort and I commend you greatly. 


I went through 2 weeks of hell. By day 6 I started seeing the light again (mentally) . A lot of anxiety on day 5 to 8. By day 11  I'm starting doing the things i love and want to do. I started checking off the things on my todo list instead of postponing things all the time.  Looking forward to getting to day 30. Good luck to all.

Throughout those 2.5 years I have been able to successfully take tolerance breaks, (typically 1-3 months long) but within the past two months I have been failing to quit. I would make a week or so of being off until I was offered a bowl or a hit of a blunt and would find myself unwilling to say no, with the last occurrence being last night. 

Now I'm tossing a post in the pot to have some vague form of accountability that I am not slowing down in my intake, I am not taking a break from this, I am leaving my marijuana consumption in the past.

I have had a on/ off relationship with it since, never allowing it to get the point of serious withdrawals but still feeling the addiction creeping up, taking a little break, then puffing up again. It insidiously creeps up on my life again and again. I remember telling myself 6 months ago no more. Yet here I am, still smoking on the weekends, then maybe in the week because why not its just weed and everyone has it and blah blah. 

I need to quit fooling myself into thinking it is somehow helping me long term. No, it's just holding me back long term, and providing me with a short term comforting dreamy high. It is the one drug that has always been around, my dad is a lifelong addict so i have seen it first hand, I used to steal weed from him regularly when I was a teenager (27 now). 

Don't really know where this post is going mainly just as a reference point for me. I'm sick of the drugs, thank fuck I have managed to quit porn as that shit was the worst, but I'm realizing weed is almost as insidious. Even though I tell myself otherwise.

Going to try take a one month break, probably the longest break in five years. Wish me luck.",2,0

I was taking bong rips every 20 minutes, pretty much, increasingly for the 4-5 years before that. 
Today, I just graduated college after 6 years and am waiting on hearing back from a job opportunity in my field. I am moving in with my boyfriend who I love very much in less than a week, and my parents are finally able to stop supporting my financially for the most part. I’m stable and working on taking care of myself mentally and physically, and generally, I’m happy. I wouldn’t have believed anyone if they’d told me I’d be here a year ago. 
It does get easier. It does get better. I still have cravings once in a while, but I have the tools to manage them. Therapy is a huge help. If you’re struggling with quitting, it can make such a huge difference if you stick to it. If I could go from smoking a million times a day to not at all for a year, you can do it too.

Now, I need to stop.","I was not a regular weed smoker as a young person. I would estimate I tried it less than five times before the age of 24.

COVID lockdowns and my struggles with anxiety and depression changed that. I began taking THC oil to pass the time during lockdown, then graduated to a vaporizer and bong rips. I wouldn't get high all-day, save for the occasional weekend, but I have been getting high every evening and enjoying the effects while I took-up playing PS4 with my friends. This was also new for me because I was not much of a gamer as a kid/teen either.

Recently, I have noticed the effects I experience after smoking (even after trying many different strains) are no longer positive. When I started, I would feel relaxed, euphoric and even social after having a couple bong rips. I have noticed the past few months, I experience extreme paranoia and sometimes panic attacks when I get high.

The craziest thing is... I'm still doing it. I don't know if it's the routine, or if I'm addicted or what, but I haven't stopped smoking despite HATING the effects recently. I have also noticed my performance at work deteriorating. Lack of motivation, lack of creativity, anxious thoughts clouding my mind have all contributed to me being a less productive worker.

I have decided to stop. I hope my creativity and motivation will return while the more extreme psychological problems will dissipate.

I’ve been trying to quit smoking this entire year and, prior to this week, had only managed to go 36hrs before I caved and searched for my next hit. I’m currently on day 3 and have been dealing with some vicious cravings, mood swings and general exhaustion.   

On day 1, I reached out to my friends for support and let them know that I wasn’t doing too well. One friend instantly says that she doesn’t have an addictive personality and has quit cigarettes before so she can’t sympathize. She’s also a current  daily weed smoker. So I challenge her to stop smoking for a month starting the next day with me. Like most of us, she’s in that phase where she believes that weed helps her be creative and work better, when really it just slows her down. Her response was no thanks, maybe in a month and listed a packet of excuses as to why she can’t stop. 


A few hours later, she comes back to the group chat with this theory: “ok, I think I get what you are going through now. I’m having withdrawals of this guy I’m seeing and miss him and he’s essentially like a drug to me. So I get what you are going through”.

I got really upset and told her it’s a shit comparison and that drug addiction and detox isn’t a joke.  Then to say this dude is like a drug to you and try and compare it to my current withdrawals is shit and pretty self-centered.  You just started to see him and he’s love bombing you already and you compare your LUST to my addiction withdrawals?!

Since then, I’ve posted dozens of times. I’ve received and left hundreds of comments. I’ve messaged with tons of folks. 

This week I graduate my masters program with honors. This accomplishment was only possible because I got sober. If I hadn’t made that decision 2 years ago, I have no idea where I’d be today. But I’m confident it wouldn’t include a cap and gown and my family and friend’s pride.

Most of the women in my West African country do not understand addiction and mental health so I give her a lot of props for not forcing me to stop but rather giving me the chance to change my thinking, other women left. Anyways back to the topic, She told my Mum about some of the stuff I said to her and goodness me I wouldn't even say those things to my worst enemy. Yep, I was psychotic. Lost track off goals, put my web development career on hold sorta cos i’d always wake and bake that I loose sight of my to do list. I did it to escape dropping out of University and feeling left behind after a yet-to-happen music dream didn't work according to my timing. I'm still stuck working with basic Javascript and Wordpress because I haven't had the discipline to forget my habit and learn better technologies. I always start and pause my FreeCodeCamp journey. This may feel off and may not even make sense but I need to talk to someone and I don't know anyone who would understand my situation like you guys will. 
I hated my days, felt less respected, very irritable and “useless” dare I say because anytime i’d wake and bake, my whole day will be spent binging Youtube and Netflix in the process depleting the broadband I have budgeted for my business. 
I have been a daily user for 5 years quitting for weeks & months in between anytime I sense a good opportunity coming or I feel a sense of a change of environment. 
The things that always brought me back to weed is this “disco” sorta feeling in the first few weeks when you quit. I sense positives and negatives and they all culminate in bringing me back to where I started. 
My day anytime I quit for the first few days goes like this,
The morning depression which I dread the most, anytime I wake up I feel like I've lost everything, down and depressed dunno how to put my thoughts together, but then after that wears I start to feel like Superman. Stoic, less irritable, Control my routines better and best of all, I don't look for food, which can keep me working for hours on end, therefore I achieve more. But as time passes, this feeling goes away and I start craving it all over again. Hence I always go back to using.

I'm a smart, capable young woman with a whole future ahead of me. I understand (more or less) the science of addiction and how insidious of a disease it is, and yet that does nothing to stop me falling into the trap over and over again.

Why cant I kick this fucking plant? I'm doing well, I'm feeling better, withdrawals are past, and then? Bam. Right back at the start. Talk about demoralising. 

Why has nothing I've tried been working? I can do up to 2 weeks sober with relatively little problem, but never really make it past that. I relapse for a few days, immediately back to daily use, and then wake up and dust myself off just to do it again in another 2 weeks. Why do I keep doing this?

I know there's a chemical imbalance in my brain. Being sober is fine, but nothing compared to the rush of weed. I know it can take months for my brain to level out again, and I know every time I use I'm just extending the process, but that just doesn't stop me.

I know my surroundings and situation are probably the most enabling they've ever been. I'm not trying to make excuses, but if there was more of a barrier, I might be able to resist those cravings more easily than if theres literally some in the house. But I cant do anything about my situation. So I guess I just have to figure a way around it.

I don't know guys. I'm just feeling fucking torn down at the moment. I know this isnt a hopeless fight. I know I've made some progress. At the start of the year I struggled to string 3 days sober together, and now I can do 14. Okay, it's still kinda pathetic, but I can tell how much better sobriety is. I just can't seem to stick to it indefinitely. Yet.

2 Throw out your bongs, bubblers, or any other complex smoking tools you have, giving them away can persist the sunk-cost fallacy. Keep your smallest pipe out of sight, preferably a difficult to reach spot

3 Do not smoke in the morning or night time, not only is it the best time to get stuff done, its also horrible for your sleep in the long run.

4 Try to go cold turkey once a week.

When I did these steps, I find that my tolerance will go down dramatically, I punish myself less for relapse, making it less stressful to quit, and it makes it 100 times easier to set goals like ""I won't smoke till tomorrow"". The once a week attempt will get easier every time, and I had a lot more progress than now.

This isn't a post for people who relapse after not smoking for a month, thats an entirely different problem.

This is a post for someone who is taking lung busters every morning and freaks the fuck out when they try to quit. Its easy to just say ""suck it up"" or ""you won't quit till you really want to"", in most cases you'll find people only wanting to quit while they're high. I am one of those people, and while this isn't a guaranteed method, it's helped me a ton and I hope it helps you. If not, you still ruled out one more option, right? :)

298,2021-05-25 01:07:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nkhqn4/whats_the_point/,What's the point?,"Hi all,

I've officially hit 3 weeks without weed. But I'm struggling to find a reason why I'm even doing this. I started vaping weed about 3 years ago as a medicinal way to treat my chronic migraines, but it quickly turned into an all-day, every-day habit. I also suffer from depression/anxiety and found myself using the weed to ""numb"" myself from the pain of life. Yes, it also helped with the migraines, but I always found myself making excuses to vape, even when I didn't have a migraine. It slowly caused me to isolate myself from friends and family. My favorite thing was to get high.

In addition to the migraines, I've also developed some pretty bad digestive issues over the past few years. Part of me wonders if the weed caused this. Possible Cannabis Hyperemis, as I have been having a ton of issues with throwing up all the time. A few weeks ago, I got REALLY sick due to my doctors accidentally prescribing a few different medications for my depression/migraines that caused Serotonin Syndrome, which almost killed me. Hands down the most sick I've ever felt in my entire life. I'm still recovering. This is what triggered me to stop vaping weed, as that could contribute to the Serotonin Syndrome, and my doctor forced me to quit my anti-depressant cold turkey due to the potentially fatal side effects with the medication mix-up. At first, I was excited to stop the weed and go medication-free. Reading posts on here gave me hope for a better life, but now I'm wondering why I'm doing this at all.

These chronic health issues have left me a shell of the person I used to be. And now that I don't even have weed or an anti-depressant, I feel more depressed than ever. The only thought that brings me comfort is the knowledge that I will die one day and be able to escape the miseries of life. There is nothing to look forward to anymore. My chronic health issues have robbed me of all my favorite hobbies: hiking, mountain climbing, running. It has prevented me from being able to date or see friends, and I've slowly lost all social connections (in part due to chronic nausea and frequent vomiting in public, in addition to my weed addiction). Due to my digestive issues, my body can't process anything but plain, unseasoned food. I can only eat \~6 things now (plain chicken, plain salmon, plain potatoes, plain carrots, plain asparagus, and bread). My body immediately vomits when I try to eat anything else. I've had loads of medical tests and the doctors can't find anything wrong with me, so without a diagnosis or cure, I struggle to see a light at the end of this horrible tunnel.

With no friends, no hobbies, no yummy food... nothing... what else is there to enjoy in life? I'm literally looking for any answers. Even movies/TV make me sad because it usually depicts people with happy lives, taking the simple things in life for granted.

When I was a kid, I always imagined that one day, I would be able to get married and have children, but I now know that will never happen. I can barely take care of myself. I also recently lost two very close family members, which makes it all so much worse. The grief is unbearable. And the knowledge that one day, I will have no one left, makes me so sad (my only family left are my 70 year old parents).

I've wanted to quit the weed for awhile, to see if it was causing these health issues, but I'm not so sure anymore. I don't know how long it will take to figure out if quitting the weed will help my stomach. And I don't know if it's even worth it. I find myself questioning why I quit the weed when I truly just want to die, so why do I even give a s\*\*t about my health?

I already see a therapist, but it doesn't do much good. My therapist can't bring the joy back to my life. I don't even know why I'm posting on here - I guess just to get my thoughts out of my head and possibly get some feedback from anyone else who has gone through something similar.

Smoked my first joint and it opened a rabbit hole of drugs and escape for 10 years! Long story short I was arrested in about 89 and offered drug diversion. Quit it all but the hardest, other than nicotine, was weed. The comforting old friend kept calling me back and tickling the back of my mind and urging me to smoke and go back to what was comfortable. Finally kicked it and went back to school, got my HS GED, through Junior college, out of 4 year with a degree in Chemistry, and then went on to get my Ph.D. in Chemistry in 2001. Imagine what I could have done if I hadn't smoked that first joint. Married with savings and getting ready to retire in a few years. Never thought I would be here but when you stop the mind numbing delusion of comfort weed gives you and rely on yourself it's amazing what you can do.

If I can do it, so can you. I check in on this sub pretty regularly and see a LOT of people just starting out and so I thought I'd post something that folks just getting started might like to see. Don't get me wrong, it was **NOT** easy for me. **However, it actually IS possible, lol.** 

Now, full disclosure: my first month was shit. Many of the usual withdrawal bullshit, no appetite, shitty, irritable moods, nauseau, etc etc. But that all passed. Also, do I still think about it, yep, sure do. BUT, it really is a ton easier than it was. 

I was a stereotypical ""functional stoner"" in that I have a good job (that doesn't drug test, haha) and a reasonably comfortable life. I could afford my habit and was not having legal problems or anything like that. Honestly, I think that is part of what has made it so hard to completely move past it. I have to continually remind myself that I HATED being a slave to pot. I HATED needing it to do any fucking thing. I HATED having to plan travel, vacation, concerts, sporting events and, well, fucking anything around getting pot or making arrangements to damn sure have some available. And that awful feeling of running out without a readily available re-up (my state does not have legal pot). Fucking miserable, and I have to remind myself a LOT.

Used to smoke heavily but gave up 20 years ago (I'm 59M). I didn't regret giving up at all and after a few weeks really felt over it.

Then over the years, my drinking became a problem, so gave that up too, with some help from friends over in r/stopdrinking. Then the pandemic came along. Now many of you won't agree with this, which is fine, but my perspective on all this is that we hugely over-reacted to the virus and caused a lot of harm in the process. This made me really angry and depressed. I was made redundant too, which didn't help.

So I turned to grass as the lesser of the two evils to get me through it. Of course, within a few days I was back to daily smoking. It hasn't all been bad - I've enjoyed it at times - but I really feel this isn't something I want to do forever, and it has been triggering IBS, which is no fun at all.

So here I am on Day 1. Flushed a bunch down to the toilet this morning and white-knuckling it now. In some ways it is going to be harder than giving up drinking, I think. One of my key tools then was 'play the tape forward', which is to imagine the next 24 hours if I had a drink. That might include a hangover, perhaps an argument with my wife, feelings of self-loathing etc. But with grass, the downside is much more subtle. It's the loss of focus, the cravings and the knowledge that I am not being my best self.

I had never thought of weed and porn as an addiction. Looking back now I realize how the source of my depression and anxiety is related to these two things.

My friends smoke a lot and I feel that smoking weed has become part of my personality. I'm very humourous and outgoing and people know me as a weed smoker guy and associate this with me, as a fun thing. I never realized how damaging this was growing up. While everyone was getting a boyfriend, having sex, studying hard I was smoking weed and watching porn in the middle of the night, It's so depressing to write this. :(
Meeting friends means smoking weed, all parties, nights at the bar, get togheters and so on are centered in ""going to the back of the party to smoke weed"" multiple times. I can't imagine myself going to a social event without participating in these weed smokers rounds. How to get this out of my personality? How did you deal with this?

I'm 21 and live with my parents, since the coronavirus outbreak started, my addiction got worse. Since they don't like me smoking, I lie to them all the time, making quick breaks to smoke weed. I stay up late to wait for them to fall asleep so I can smoke and watch porn. It has been the only source of joy in my life at quarantine.

I believe in my potential. I'm a skilled designer, I work and have a lot of interest in art. But I feel like I'm wasting my potential If my only source of hapiness is smoking pot and jerking off to porn. I'm still trying to tell this to my shrink but its hard!!!

I wanna have a boyfriend, I wanna trust myself sexually, I wanna have fun without needing pot, I wanna sleep more, I wanna study and read a lot. These things seem Impossible now. I live in fear.

It's been 4 days without weed or porn now and I'm determined to reach my goal. I want to be a better person. I know it wont be easy as I'm having intrusive thoughts already to smoke. 

Thank you, I had to get this out of me. Please leave your comments and similar experiences, it would really help me.

I had a time in my life where I got addicted to hard drugs.. got sober for about 3 years... then thought I could “just smoke weed” again. That societal ideology that weed “isn’t that bad” stuck with me for a long time. 

Fast forward 3 years later, 2021. I’ve been trying to quit smoking basically since a few months after I started back up again, but this habit has had a strong hold on me. 

Find out my girlfriend and I are having a baby. This is my “xyz”. I’m nervous, but ready. Crunch time. Get my Life together. Quit smoking. Let’s do it. 

I didn’t do it. 

I smoked everyday up until the day my baby girl was born. Saying that the next day would be my last, all the way leading up to it. I did okay in the hospital without it. I had PLENTY to distract me and to think about. Didn’t eat the entire time, but that was probably a mixture of PAWS and the fact that I was nervous AF. 

Baby girl Ryleigh came last Wednesday, I fell in love, swore off that stuff forever. We spent a few days in the hospital. Came home last Friday. And the first thing I did when I got home... roll a joint and go outside. “I deserve this.”

Man, the guilt I felt walking back inside and looking at my daughter was something I never want to feel again. She’s so beautiful and here I am, needing to smoke weed to enjoy her and take care of her? What kind of father did/DO I want to be. I think that was the last time for real. I think I hit the rock bottom with weed that I needed. 

So, here’s to day 3. It’s 6:19 am EST, I’ve been up every hour on the hour, but not because I can’t sleep without weed. But because my daughter and girlfriend need me. I don’t have the option anymore. 

I guess my point is this - don’t wait for some life event or deadline to quit. I did, and it’s probably making my life a bit harder than it would be if I had been sober. going into fatherhood. But hey, I’m doing it, and it’ll be an accomplishment to say that my daughter has never seen me high.

It's confusing because when I started smoking I was severely depressed so I didn't have energy anyway, being high felt no different. I actually felt like I had *more* energy while I was high, it helped silence my negative voices and the crushing emptiness. I've gotten a lot better over the years but thought my still present energy struggles were probably some leftover subclinical symptoms. Now I'm wondering if I should see smoking weed as the leftover symptom that is causing me to have little energy.

It's mind blowing, I have gotten so used to living with depression that it wasn't (still kinda isn't) possible to imagine what life would feel like without it. I hope I'm not just on some accomplishment high or something and that this lasts.",2,0

That's when I discovered carts and how easy it is with the smell. I wasn't as bad as some people on here. Me and my girl at the time would go thru two 1G carts per every week and a half or so. When we broke up I'd usually do 1 cart per week, slightly puffing throughout the day. Even at work. 

My job for most if that time was at a processing center for bills checks. I did data entry meaning I was basically entering account numbers or check amounts and stuff like that. Its the kind of thing you can do on autopilot without thinking. Like how you can dive for half an hour and daydream and not remember it at all. My error rate was damn near 0 too. 

But I'd walk around outside on my breaks and lunch and take at least 4 or 5 puffs. It was only a few older Asian ladies who worked with me in the data entry department and they were always very nice and quiet, probably never noticed I was high or would care. So no one bothered me and I'd listen to music and podcasts all day.

It sounds nice but now I see what a danger it was. Risking my job, drug charges, maybe federal charges for messing with people's money while intoxicated? 

Now my job there is doing rejects, which is stuff which gets kicked out of the system cause something is wrong or it needs reprocessing. Definitely not as much of an autopilot type job. So I didn't bring my cart and holy shit idk how I'm gonna do it. 

The podcasts and music almost seem pointless.. and so do my breaks. The day drags on and I can't find joy. I feel like a damn addict but I made it thru 1 day of work with no cart.",19,0

Feeling low again, I'm 37 and have smoked daily for 20 years, I used a herbal vape 4-7 times a day for the past few years, working on my own from home made it an easy habit, an escape from the stress of family life and a dysfunctional relationship where I have not been loved or appreaciated for who I am. We're trying to work things out as a family but it's been really exhausting emotionally, no family or close friends nearby (other side of the world stories). My wife had a difficult childhood and is emotionally immature and has been very selfish, I also come from a family where emotions were repressed and at 16 I found my escape with weed, never stopped running.

I managed 4 months without, feeling so much better, then slipped down the path of ""just a hit on the weekend"" and within a month I'm back at my old habits, no energy, feeling low and ashamed. Part of it is due to my current living circumstances, but I know it's up to me to make meaningful change in my life, I'm just feeling so stuck in the drag of work+kids+wife that all seem to bring me more misery than joy, weed is such a peaceful escape (for the first 30 minutes that is, then it's just miserable too).

We just moved to a beautiful but remote place, no connections, feeling isolated, it was easy to relapse.

Replacing these old habits sure can be hard.

341,2021-05-24 00:26:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/njphbm/third_day_down_more_to_come/,"third day down, more to come","it has been three days since i have decided to stop smoking weed. i feel so good. 

i had smoked heavily on and off, but mostly on, for three years now. i started when i was 18-19.  it all began when i was taking a gap year and saving up money for uni. during my gap year, i was going through it with family stuff and my depression fully hit for the first time. i didn't know what i was feeling, i  couldn't process my emotions, and i wanted to feel anything but the numbness i felt inside  so when i came across weed, my god, it was the perfect relief at the time. 

soon i was always hanging out with people who smoked before doing anything, i can hardly remember actually going out and enjoying things with people without being high. 

all of that time i wanted to save money for uni? yeah that didn't happen. instead my money went to buying loads of weed and planning trips with friends to get completely fucked. 

fastforward to my first year in uni, and i was smoking a bit less, actually trying for my first semester. then something happened with my parents that pulled me into another deep depression, and then i started to not care about school second sem. i showed up to class and did the bare minimum to just pass. i looked forward to just going home and getting high. 

weed consumed my life, but the weird thing is, it didn't feel like it at the time. if i was already feeling numb from everything going on in my life, what difference did it make if i smoked a little to feel something? ngl when you first start smoking and your tolerance is low, the release feels like no other.  soon, i became desperate in pursuit of that feeling. but as you know, our body gets comfortable with that feeling until it becomes your ""normal"" state, and then being sober feels even worse. 

the effects of smoking everyday was incredibly damaging to my life, looking back at it now. 

i stopped being mindful in the things i used to love to do. i forgot things constantly, my mind was either always scattered or foggy. i kept misplacing shit even when i had just held it a second ago.  i used to be engaged in conversations or at least had something to offer in light banter. i became that person who gave half- ass reactions, and i stopped relating to the friends that weren't getting as high as i was. 

movies ! i would love getting into it and being analytical about every scene, line, action and gesture of characters and make connections to things in my life and apply it to the world around me. what was so ironic was that one time before, when i wasn't into smoking, i had watched a movie with one of my stoner friends and saw that they weren't absorbing the movie or being engaged in it, and i was like ""huh, how does one just watch a movie and not feel anything or make any sort of observation about what they just watched?"" i understood it now. 

i couldn't absorb information anymore, i became content with just coasting through life, being half there. that shit is so dangerous. you become a person who is just okay with anything. i slowly lost my critical thinking skills and my ability to be curious about things in life. i was a vegetable stuck in my pain and my past, and the only thing that could keep me afloat was a toke or a joint. 

it got so bad that when it came to paying for rent and groceries and bills, i would put it off and instead spend whatever money i had left for weed. 

and then the pandemic hit and damn everything was a blur, i don't think I've ever smoke that much in a single time period.

what really sucked was how it affected my relationships with my friends and siblings. even meeting new people was hard. i was so tuned out from the world that i couldn't relate to people in conversation, or even remember the small details that someone would tell me about themselves. what the fuck was i doing? i was a floating entity devoid of any sort of purpose except getting completely fried out of my mind.  

now i am here. i have forced myself to face things, and I'm tired of running from it. i don't want to forget things anymore. i don't want to live my life barely conscious of everything around me. i don't want to have my sisters witness my self-destructive behaviours anymore, or forget the things that they tell me and not appreciate the moments i share with them.

i want to fall in love with learning again and be able to be fully present with the people i connect with. i want to be able to sit with my thoughts and be comfortable with them, without having to turn to weed as a clutch to feel okay. 

i hope to look back at this and be at a point in my life where i have a better grip of who i am as a person and have the strength to move forward mindfully and with purpose. 

if you're reading this, i want you to know that you really can do this. 

i guess what kept me chained to this drug was because i really had a hard time facing the things that were hurting me. i didn't understand all of the generational trauma that my family put me through, i was in the thick of processing shit and feeling things that i soon became so numb as a defense mechanism to cope. and then when i started to feel numb, getting high gave me a small window of feeling something and being able to think my own thoughts for once. it was nice to have those high afterthoughts of things that wouldn't come to me when i was sober.

but that small window was only an illusion of the real thing. what is real is right now. everything in your mind that is hurting you when you are sober, that shit takes time to dismantle and repair again. so much inner work is needed to be able to be louder than the voices that are holding you back. for anyone reading this, know that you are doing your best and that starting now is better than not trying at all. you are brave for taking the first step. i believe in you.

maybe this is only my third day, and its like that moment when your anti-depressants hit for the first time and you feel like you can take on the world, lol. 

nah but fr i haven't felt this good in so long, and I'm gonna chase that feeling, grab it by the reins and ride this out. 

if not now, then when, right?

Because I live by the acronym NOPE! Not One Puff Ever! I know myself, after 20 years of addiction that even one puff of weed means that I will quickly end up buying an ounce a week... marijuana was a false sense of security for me, its too easy to fall back there.... The work that I am doing to move forward is to increasingly become more responsive to my emotions and how I manage those emotions. For myself that means doing meditation, doing nonviolent communication training, Yoga occasionally, and therapy. All of these things combined are much cheaper than marijuana at an ounce a week.... and they actually make me responsible for myself and my relationships rather than hiding behind a cloud of smoke.

My parents divorced at an early age. They were both heavily addicted to drugs. More than just marijuana. My dad wanted to break free and moved away to a new job. He tried very hard asking her to come with an start over, but she wouldn’t. She eventually checked into rehab and my father gained custody.

I had an inclination towards my mother, so I took this pretty hard. I was seven. Once I was around 14 my father got remarried. He has only met his new wife once, my brother and I weren’t invited to the wedding. I became rebellious. Eventually being too much to handle, they sent me back to live with my mother whom was now staying with my grandmother.

I had many friends where I used to live, and consciously decided to not make friends as I felt that it would be in a way replacing my old group. I locked myself away and played video games. My grades in school suffered.

My mom held a job for awhile, eventually turning to prescription medicine during the height of the opioid epidemic under the guise of back pain. My cousin (her godson) got involved and were slowly trying to drag me in to their lifestyle. 

By then, I had repaired my relationship with my father and pleaded with him to take me back in, I was 19. I didn’t have a license, I still don’t.

I started going to parties and got involved with marijuana (I had already done this at 14 during my rebellious stage.I wanted to jumpstart a social life again as I had severe social anxiety. My brother was an alcoholic and caused issues in the home. They kicked us both out.

I then moved in with a friend - she is now my fiancé. Their living situation wasnt great, they were very poor and it was a miracle that they took me in. I became hyper focused on marijuana. I hadn’t had a real job, when I finally did get one - I didn’t really take it seriously.

My fiancé loved her grandparents. More than anything in the world. Her grandmother passed away from cancer. Eventually, the house we lived in caught fire and we lost everything we owned. They got a small trailer as a replacement. Unfortunately, my fiancé’s grandfather passed away from cancer shortly after.

We became more engrossed in weed smoking up to two ounces a week. 

My mother and cousin got more involved with medication. I warned them someone would get hurt. He ended up overdosing and dying. I held this against her for a long time.

We stayed with someone for a bit before moving into the trailer with my fiancé’s mother, and her uncle. I stopped smoking for about a year and we eventually found an apartment. We have been here for about 6 years. I held a stable job as a customer service representative for 8 years. I just transitioned to a new job which was very anxiety inducing for me. Our apartment building is being sold and I’m not sure where we will be living.

This triggered me to analyze my life. I feel like I’ve failed. I don’t have a house. I used to be extremely idealistic and wanted to provide a good life for my family members. Now I don’t live near any family. I’m trying to quit smoking to hopefully improve my life. I feel like I’ve wasted so much money and wasted my life in a blur. I still don’t have a license. My mom is in an assisted living home and extremely frail and I haven’t seen her in ten years. This saddens me.

This isn't a negative post missing ""the old days"" or times I had when stoned.

For most of my memories, especially my memories of early teens years through to young adult weed is in the picture. In many, weed is not just in the picture but weed is what caused or was a major contribution to why that time became a memory. Its unavoidable since I used it so often and, at the time, was very fascinated by its effects.

Some memories aren't good but many are. I know I should be focused on the present, and future but I cannot help but reflect on my past, my roots and all the events that were combined that brought me to where I am today. Some memories are mixed, like having an adventerous time with my best friend, listening to music and talking for hours on end. Yet having to do the activities behind my parents back and then sometimes dissapointing them.

The first time I tried really high grade weed was at 8AM while driving to my final grade 12 computer science exam... along the way it had rained briefly and when it was only when I pulled into the parking lot that I noticed the wipers were still on but the rain was no longer falling and they were loudly squeeking haha. Ended up with an 80+ on that exam for the record.

I appreciate my younger years. Sometimes I wish they had been different but there is no going back there now.

I've decided to quit smoking weed 2 weeks ago because I just feel like weed is holding me back in life and making me lazy. Since I started smoking, I don't enjoy my life sober like I used to before I started smoking. When I do things sober like hang out with friends, I just feel bored and it sucks because I used to love just hanging out with friends. I just want to take my life back and enjoy my life like I used to without weed.

The biggest thing for me and the main reason I decided to quit is because ever since I started smoking, I started developing social anxiety. I feel awkward in social situations and struggle to keep up conversations with friends and especially new people and acquaintances. I just feel extremely awkward and I hate it because I never used to be like this! I used to love meeting new people and always being around people. In fact, I used to get bored if I wasn't around people all the time. Now I'm really struggling in social situations and I keep thinking about when I'm with people.

I am very serious about quitting and not smoking again because I hate how weed changed me. I just want my life back. It's been 2 weeks since I last smoked, I feel a little bit better, excited for my new journey and I have more energy, but my social anxiety is still the same. Will my social anxiety go away?

I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy video games as much. I liked to smoke a bowl, and then get lost in a game, usually get confused and make a lot of mistakes and I thought that was the most fun I could have. Playing sober has taught me this isn't true. Actually being able to remember details and improve in games I had stagnated on has been a very rewarding experience.

My paranoia is gone. When I would smoke all these thoughts would creep into my head. I'm not good enough. All the choices I've made have been the wrong ones and there's no way I can fix it so why even try. Everyone hates me. That list could go on forever. With a clear mind, goals that seemed unobtainable as a high version of myself, I can now see myself reaching with a bit of work.

I can easily reach out to friends and family and start repairing relationships that had been damaged by my inability to reach out (which touches back on paranoia) or the fact that days would just drift by in a high stupor.

There are a lot of changes happening in my life right now, and if I was still high there is a good chance I would have ended up homeless. Now I have the confidence to face my problems head on and find a solution.

Obviously there are still ups and down like we all experience, but instead on change like a tidal wave, it's more high tide and low tide.

I started at about the age of 21 when moving out from to my own place and am now nearing my 30's and am depressed with the lifestyle that I am currently living. 

I am using weed as a crutch. I have a nice paying job but it can be either extreamly stressful or boring, its also shift work and coming home to a spliff was often the highlight to a day. Whilst I'm professional and driven at work, at home I'm ashamed of how I let my standards slip,. I'm sloppy and I procrastinate important jobs. I've been slowly working on improving my life outside of work but I have been juggling this with my smoking habit. I use weed as a reward for myself for the simplest of tasks like paying a bill which takes all of 10 minutes to do. Worse yet I often get high to do these things as a way of getting me through. 

I've had a steady girlfriend for 5 years and she is the love of my life, however recently she has stepped away from the weed while I've continued to hit it hard. Im having about a quarter to a half ounce a month. She has said that sometimes she feels as though there are 2 people in my life, her and weed and this hurts. It hurts because there's truth in it. 

I used to like the way weed made me reflect upon things, and to some extent it does put me in good analytical headspace, however its more and more common that I am sparking up and realising that this isn't a sustainable thing to be doing. 

I had an argument with my girlfriend earlier this week where she wants me to stop. She has been hinting for some time but she caught me having a cheeky smoke and said that she wants no more of it. 

I want to stop too but I am clinging onto the idea that I can enjoy weed in moderation one day. But currently I'm not anywhere near disciplined enough to do this. Id love to be at a point where I can enjoy weed on social occasions and on special occasions waste my day and giggle at some silly things. Is this a healthy aspiration? 

I've had a lengthy discussion about this with my partner and have said that I need some kind if closure, knowing that it is my last time. Its kinda pathetic if I'm being honest, and part of me thinks I'm just making excuses, but I feel like I need a symbolic gesture of some kind. So this coming weekend I have a long weekend. On the Friday I am going to go to my favourite smoking spot by a river and have one last one. Im going to enjoy it for what it is, toss the end into the water and then hopefully can start to move forward. 

I have about a half ounce in which I am going to trust with my girlfriend as she is a lot more disciplined with weed. Part of me wants to sell it or give it away for full closure.

Im going to focus on DIY and getting my house in order and also on my health and jump back into some hobbies I used to enjoy. Im kind of writing this letter out into the void, I dont really know what to expect but it feels good to get this off my chest.",3,0

I'm coming up to 2 years being an absolute stoner. My biggest problem is that its getting me though Uni with okay grades. In my sober periods, study is almost impossible with the physical discomfort of withdrawals, and it does offer a certain amount of motivation to complete and care about my work... which I have lacked since well before starting smoking.

I'm usually a lurker but I feel like venting may help, and that this is a textbook example of how relapsing is not worth it. 20 minutes of high and you'll be just as depressed as you were without it, except now you're too much of a zombie to improve your depressed life in any way, and that's how you'll be remembered by the people who love you the most, unless you stop. My experience anyway.

Tomorrow it is my birthday, which I will celebrate with my family. I will not smoke.

Wishing all of you strength in your fight.",13,0

Wether it was a one night relapse or many months and years. You will never know how many people you have helped. When I read a story of relapse, it is reconfirmation that I'm doing the right thing, and that I can never have ""just one"" on a night out, or a weekend. I must always turn it down when offered and make effort not to come into contact with it. No matter how long I'm clean for I will always need to be vigilant. 

Been seeing a lot of stories about relapse on here lately and last night they sparked a dream for me. I was at a festival/party. Everyone was getting high and drinking. Sun was shining and music was blaring. I was passed the joint and I had a bad case of the 'fuck-its' so I took a hit. And another, and another- forgetting I'd have zero tolerance from being 124 days clean. 

I came up fast, I felt totally out of control and unsafe. I enjoyed it for about 2 minutes before realising I had sacrificed all that clean time for a moment of being high. I'd put myself back into the passenger seat and let Mary take the wheel.

I wouldn't have pieced together that dream without all of you.. I experienced a relapse in a dream, and my mind filled in the blanks from things this community has written about.

So thank you for sharing: to everyone who has relapsed. Relapse can be part of the journey and it doesn't mean you've thrown away your clean time. You don't have to feel ashamed, you're still here making progress.",48,0

395,2021-05-22 20:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/niwi7s/300_days/,300 Days,"Hello,

Today marks my 300th day of sobriety from weed and alcohol. My sobriety is not something I really talk about often, but I feel like someone out there in a similar situation as I was in might benefit from hearing about my journey.

I started drinking and smoking weed in my early twenties. Soon I was a daily weed user. If I had weed, I was going to consume it. If I didn't have weed, I was going to seek it out. I would smoke before work, after work, and the entire weekend. I even would wake up in the middle of the night hit the vape pen. I was a social drinker, and on such occasions, any intention I had to stick to my limit would vanish after the first drink. I had no self-control. I gladly would smoke weed while drinking, even though it all but guaranteed I would get nauseous and vomit. Throughout my twenties, weed was my drug of choice.

I never though that I ""had a problem"" with alcohol or weed. My dad went to AA when I was a kid, and I grew up to develop the mentality that ""I am not my dad. I don't have a problem. I don't need help like him. I can handle my own shit."" At the age of 30, after ten years of daily weed use and consistent over drinking episodes, I started therapy to address years of depression and newly developed heightened anxiety. After a few months of therapy I felt like we had only been addressing my symptoms, and not the underlying causes of the anxiety and depression. In a moment of frustrated clarity I pulled out a journal and wrote out what a typical day was like for me:

1. Wake up tired after a poor night's rest feeling groggy from smoking weed last night and staying up too late watching porn.
2. Drink coffee to help wake me up
3. Not eat enough throughout the day because the caffeine suppressed my appetite.
4. Get high after work
5. Overeat in the evening because I hadn't eaten all day and now I had the munchies.
6. Get high again and stay up way too late watching porn.

Repeat again the next day, waking up tired. Day in and day out.

Writing these notes down, seeing how cyclical it was, how each step factored into other steps, gave me a perspective I had never really noticed before. Not only was I compulsively using, I had a poor diet, was getting poor sleep, and was too lethargic to exercise. These seemingly harmless things on their own, were all combining into a very unhealthy lifestyle for me. And I thought that maybe, just maybe, the cumulative effect of all of these aspects were causing my anxiety and depression. I told my therapist about this, and I admitted to myself that I am an addict, uggg yes just like my dad, and that I can't do this on my own like I thought. I had been in denial and I wanted to try to make a change.

She got me in touch with an addiction recovery specialist. He described to me that the cycle I had developed was called co-addiction. The first thing he had me do was to just keep a log of anytime I drank, used weed, or watched porn. No need to change anything about my behavior at this time, just simply observe. I would note when, and how many drinks, how much weed, or how long I watched porn for. This exercise helped me to to be more mindful of my behavior through quantifying it. I would report back with my log after a week and we would discuss practical ways to help reduce the amount I drank, smoked or watched porn for the upcoming week. He gave me goals to aim for, not asking me to go cold turkey with any particular item. I learned about Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and how to use the DBT skills to help me be more mindful, to be present, to tune into my feelings, and to help catch and deal with undesirable feelings before they caused me to spiral. I feel really lucky and fortunate to have had such knowledgeable people supporting me, guiding me, helping me learn about managing difficult emotions, about how addiction and substances hijack your brain, and also learning ways to rewire the brain.

I want to encourage anyone out there struggling with alcohol, weed, or other substance related issues to not give up. Be willing to observe yourself without judgement, to simply see your actions as the result of altered brain chemistry caused by substances. Your substance use does not define you and does not make you a bad person. I highly recommend learning about DBT. When we start to pull back from the substance coping mechanisms we were using to avoid facing difficult emotions and feelings, the DBT skillset can help manage the emotions and feelings that may start to come up. Be willing to ask for help. Getting sober is a journey, not a moment. Sometimes just starting from a harm reduction perspective can help get you to a more stable point where you might be willing to then aim for sobriety.  Be willing to accept that we can't handle this alone. If you relapse don't beat yourself up, your relapse doesn't define you. Having a supportive community is so helpful. Whether it's AA, MA, r/sober, or r/leaves, in all of those communities you will find people just like you and me, and you can get those helpful reminders that you are not alone in this.

I recently realized that I am a fucking loser and I need to change. I’ve been in school for the past seven years and I graduate with a Finance degree this fall. I touched up my resume, got recommendation letters, and really tried to find a job. And I got one. I didn’t meet any of their preferred qualifications, but they liked me enough to give me a chance. 

I went in the following day to sign paperwork. HR asked the guy I interviewed with if I need a drug test, he says “of course”, then turns to me asks “you don’t do drugs do you”? And laughs. 

I was honest. I told him I’d fail. He said he needed to talk to the VP and told me to fill out paperwork. I remember thinking “why the fuck am I filling out paperwork? They’re going to fire me. Just let me leave”. He calls me into his office. 

“Ok, so we’re just not going to drug test you”. 

I am well aware how lucky I am. This was beyond any best case scenario. You think this would open my eyes and make me quit smoking weed but here I am. Stoned. Writing to you. I’ve tried so hard to quit. I can’t. The couple days I went without it, I was drunk the whole time. If this  opportunity won’t open my eyes what the fucking hell will? I don’t know if they’re eventually going to drug test me. And I am willing to take that risk they don’t and keep smoking pot. I don’t know how to quit. Please help me.

There's so much to fix in my life, yet I can't bring myself to do it.

404,2021-05-22 16:41:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nirlzm/here_goes_nothin/,Here goes nothin',"Hello lovely humans,

I'm new to this forum and since scrolling this has given me so much motivation that others are kind of feeling the same way I do and actively are stronger than me in giving different methods tries.  I'm currently 25 and I truly think there is a crossroads ahead of me in my life.  I have been either smoking or high most of my waking moments for the past 7-8 years and I always found ways to justify it as I do well in school and generally have motivation to get up, out, or even dabble with new things and ""embrace the suck"" with certain crafts and things.

 My whole family smokes, my sibling and father and I actually supply everyone with monthlies, we hang out bi-weekly and are generally a closely knit family.  

I'm coming to the conclusion that although seemingly harmless and almost a ceremonial thing my family likes to do a lot, I want to move forward and quit for my own career and general constant fog and recent apathy about pushing out  of my comfort zone. I'm currently in the twilight zone and changing between being a fulltime chef and going back to school for finance, something I recently fell in love with in the past year. I decided to get back to school and pursue an MBA, all while studying and smoking non stop, I justify this habit with being in school and getting good grades, but the habit actually confines me to less sociability, less risk on actually living life (not dangerous risk, just those moments you say no to because you could be comfortable at home really add up.) 

I've talked to my family about it and it seems like everything really revolves back to the weed use, I could be doing better financially without smoking, I could be more social without smoking, I could be all around full of anxiety and uncomfortable until a full withdrawal is over though, even then after that I'd have to get over the psych behind it as I truly grew up with weed, its in my family, and deep down I do love it. 

I'm just looking for some other humans, after reading on this forum it does seem like some of the arguments for cold turkey are the best, as I do agree with the psychology of quitting outright because my brain would like to cheat, make new dates and goals just to keep smoking if I were to taper. The stomach problems are my main withdrawal symptom as well as I've had to leave dinners and just be alone cause I can't eat or deal with any food around, and I'm a chef its just a weird conundrum.

I really feel like this is the time because I'm about to enter a masters program and after that I'm going to embrace a completely new industry, I really want to change for my own eating habits and sociability as well as embracing a new industry with a clear head. That's all.  I'm going to construct and date by the end of the month to outright quit I think, I'm just scared of how long it'll take to feel better, and even after that screwing it up by genuinely liking weed.",3,0

Need help,"I’ve been really sick this past week with nausea and vomiting, and of course I’m a heavy smoker. I live in Canada, and if you also live here, you might understand why I’m hesitant on the ER doctor’s diagnosis. The hospitals here are overloaded because of covid (Canada is struggling a lot). It’s common place to get an IV and have a doctor give you a diagnosis based upon a quick look at your charts. 

 Basically I’m doing a trial run of zero cannabis to determine if it’s really CHS that I have. I figure that if I’m still experiencing symptoms after 2 weeks then it’s most likely not CHS. What are some cold-turkey tips for someone who’s a little embarrassed to be asking in the first place? I live with my GF, and she’s still smoking so it’s a little trickier for me. She’s super supportive and has already suggested that she smokes when I’m not around, so I don’t see and get tempted. It really helps with her mental health so I don’t want to make it difficult for her.

Haven't stopped for more than 2 weeks in the last 5 years. I've also been using meth for 2-3 years now. Amazing, I know. 

About 10 months ago I got the gift of allergies. 
They used to be brutal, but now they are improving. 
Yesterday was my last day using meth - I love it and everything about it while using, but afterwards... 

Today I had a harsh allergic reaction, as has happened the last few times after using both meth and weed. Luckily I always carry antihistamines so I got it covered this time, did not need to go to the ER. 

I'm not sure what's different this time, but something definetly is. I do not want to be so emotionally attached to these substances. They had their benefit in my life and I'm grateful for my experiences so far. 

I want to close that chapter of my life. 

I know this subreddit is not for people who want to take breaks, but I wanted to share this somewhere :

As a start, a first, tangible goal, I promise (to myself) that I will not use weed for at least 90 days. After 20.08.2021 has passed, I will make a choice based on my experiences during this period. Maybe not the best straregy, but I may just pull this off. 

Like I said, I just wanted to share my intentions somewhere. 

Any words of wisdom or compassion are welcome. 
Critiques are also not a bad thing, so if you have something for me, let me have it. 


Stay blessed guys 🙏🏼💚",2,0

And I know if I dont deal with this it's going to grow until I cave in a few days. That's what happened the last 3 or 4 times. So, here goes nothing.

Why do I want to smoke? I'm bored. It's the weekend and I think having a little bit would be fun and not harmful. 

Let me look at that closer. I'm bored. Which basically means I have nothing interesting to do. How is weed going to fix that? Smoking itself isnt particularly interesting, in fact it's outright unpleasant if I pay proper attention to my lungs. Being high only makes uninteresting things interesting because I'm too zonked to tell the difference. Do I really want to spend my weekend doing nothing interesting AND give up my hard earned sobriety? No, no I dont.

""Fun and not harmful."" Is it really? It wouldn't be any more fun than just sitting and watching youtube (my pastime when smoking alone), and I dont feel like doing that sober because its mind numbing. And it would be harmful, not just physically, but also because it would set me down the slippery slope of addiction. I've worked hard to climb out, I dont want to be back in the thick of it again. Id be back to being a liar and a hypocrite and full of shame and guilt. Plus I'd probably eat until I feel sick and undo the little weight progress I've made, or even worse have alcohol due to lower inhibitions, and I *really* dont want that.

It's hard to say it's from not smoking alone, but it kind of is in a roundabout way. By kicking the habit I've had to fill my time with other things so I'm not sitting around having to consciously fight the urge to light up. Working out, playing with my dog, learning coding, putting in applications for better jobs, cooking and baking... even posting nudes on reddit (under a different account with some newfound confidence lol). All of which feel like a marked improvement over sitting around stoned whenever I had a free moment, and a few times when I didn't. 

It's still tough sometimes though. I'm still peddling to people that ostensibly can handle it better than I can, and it's so *frustrating* that I can't be the type of person that can smoke in moderation. My company still tries to offer employee incentives mostly in the form of product (free 1/8th or gram of wax once per month, vendor samples, sales/commission incentives, etc.) But being around the product isn't really a problem for me at work. It's much like working at any other retail location where product is explicitly for customers only. It's an abstract sale item rather than an object that I crave.

At home is a different story sometimes. Especially after a long day at work or if family drama is flaring up, nothing sounds better than lighting up. Alcohol just doesn't scratch the itch the same way, and even then I'm making a concerted effort to limit that so I don't trade one addiction for another (arguably worse) one. It sucks not being able to use the one medicine that really helped relieve my anxiety without long-standing side effects. 

All said though, I wouldn't go back. I all-too-vividly remember how good caving in to my addictions feel. But I see the path it took some of my coworkers down, and I can't live that kind of life. Frankly, I'm better than that and owe it to myself to see what the best version of myself is. Everyone does, and if you're here then you know your best life demands that you remove something that makes you so complacent with just being 'ok'.",12,0

I was in a state for 3 weeks where weed is illegal, so I took my first real break in a year. The first few days were bad, emotional and physical got me, I cried a lot. But pretty soon I was feeling good, I missed weed but couldn't find any and eventually I started thinking, I miss it but this is better. I had nightmares every night which was scary, but I also slept a normal amount, ate a normal amount, three up a normal amount (aka zero times!) and read 8 books in 2 weeks! I came back home on Tuesday and have been getting high since, because I missed it, but now I'm back in this binge eating, exhausted cycle, not getting lots of work done, not exactly sad but not exactly happy. But I somehow, now that's it's here and legal again, keep feeling the need to light up. I'm sober now, but I'm a little sleepy and foggy and it's occurred to me to smoke a few times. But the binge eating has to stop. The fatigue!! The sore throat!!

Addiction blows. I know that's what this is, because the logical side of me says babe just toss it. I'm trying so hard to become a more intuitive person, and this weed stumbling block is just getting me. It also helps in so many ways, calm, sleep, anxiety relief. (I had my worst panic attack ever while I was out of town this month).

Anyway, just venting :) I just need to be me, it doesn't matter to me if that means using or abstaining. But whenever I binge eat I know I'm not being intuitive, not hearing what my sober body need when I'm high.",4,0

I’ve noticed it’s a pattern that the day after I go out I’m extremely sensitive, usually cry and can be easily irritable. At this point I don’t know if it’s weed that causes this or if it’s being around others. 
I smoke every day and I’m overall depressed, but I can get things done, go on walks by myself and not be an emotional mess (I have BPD, but I’ve been learning to manage my mood swings).

I want to ask others with social anxiety, depression and/or BPD if they experience similar issues after hanging out with people. If you are a fellow stoner I’d also like to hear if you’ve been able to identify a direct link between smoking at parties as opposed to alone and some change in your mood for the worse.

421,2021-05-22 07:01:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nig6c6/1_week_feels_great_to_take_my_power_back/,1 WEEK: FEELS GREAT TO TAKE MY POWER BACK!!!! 💥,"To everyone trying to quit and for those who are going through withdrawal; I just want you to know that what you’re feeling is completely normal. Being in this detrimental loop is fucking exhausting and really frustrating. I’ve been there and just a week ago, I decided to put an end to that loop and confront what’s stopping me all along — myself. 

I was coming down from what’s now my last high moment when I found this subreddit and decided to pen my commitment to stop. I wrote here my first ever post on reddit and decided to get out of my own way.

I think the most crucial part of quitting is to be extra patient with yourself. When you do that, when you decide to guide yourself in the quitting process instead of viewing yourself as a loser for giving in to addiction, you’ll be able to find the reasons as to why you got addicted to the substance. Be brave enough to face all the issues that you’re trying to conceal with marijuana and realize that you’ll only be able to solve it when you’re sober. You just need to prepare yourself for all these issues to arise but importantly, be extra nice to yourself. Sooner or later, you will have to face to these so why prolong the agony, right? Hear yourself out and decide to commit to the healing process. 

I’m just on my 1st week now and it feels so good!! I’ve never felt more alive. I had a terrible withdrawal but with it comes all the realizations that I would’ve never gotten if I was still smoking. You see, when you begin to admit that weed is not really the problem, you’ll realize what led you to using and abusing the substance is merely your ego trying to cover up all the issues that you need to face in order for you to grow and evolve. Confronting your pain and all of your sufferings is the only way to heal and progress. All shortcuts won’t save you and will eventually take a toll on you.

Another important thing is to commit yourself to the process and part of it is doing everything that’s necessary to keep you from using the substance again. In my case, I messaged my plugs and told them that I am quitting for good (I’m living in a country where weed is illegal), I muted them after that. I also told my stoner friends and they all respected my decision. I also got rid of all my paraphernalia and prepared myself for the withdrawal period. Every time I felt the urge to smoke, I would workout (if I’m at home) or take a moment to meditate and face what’s causing the trigger inside me. I also unfollowed all weed-related pages that I used to subscribe and changed the playlist that I am listening to. Above all, I made peace with the fact that I got addicted to weed and that I am currently healing. There were moments when the feelings of regret and shame come to the surface but remind yourself that you have all the power to change your perspective and decide for yourself. As for me, whenever these feelings arise, I would tell myself that it’s all in the past there’s nothing I can do about it. For all I know, maybe I really had to go through that phase. No cap, I had some great insights and realizations too while under the influence of weed as I would use (or misuse lol) it in spiritual practices and I now view it as an opportunity to grow. Everything happens for a reason, right? Now, you just have to make a decision to be better, to do better all for your future self and you can do that when you decide to be completely honest with yourself.

I also check this group couple of times every day and the supportive energy that the people here emanate has surely helped me in the process. 

Celebrate small victories and allow yourself to feel without becoming your feelings. You can always redirect your triggers into something more positive. 

PS: Today marks my first year of being nicotine-free. I decided to quit vaping exactly 1 year ago and I cannot wait till I mark my 1st year of being free from marijuana addiction. And next month, I’ll be marking my 2nd anniversary since I stopped drinking alcohol.

I've been also dealing with a 4 year relationship breakup, moving house twice, changing career and all the while making sure my dog has an awesome life even despite all of that. 

As Sun Tzu (The Art of War) said: 

""To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy. ... If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle""

""To subdue the enemy without fighting is the supreme excellence. Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy. Next best is to disrupt his alliances by diplomacy. The next best is to attack his army.""

I guess what I mean is, there were times 4 weeks ago where I'd have laughed if you said I'd get through all those triggers and still be standing sober. 

Dealing with the triggers, it's all a mind game. It's all about writing down and talking it out with a trusted accountability partner in your life. Someone who knows you and knows your addiction and perhaps even your triggers if you can share those.

My aunt was an alcoholic (10 year sober now), and she's always been open about addiction. Without her teachings I don't think I would have stopped on my own until it was too late. 


I think the weed community has to be open about the fact that smoking everyday could be a sign of addiction, and to know what signs to look out for when using frequently. People on r slash trees continuously write the mantra of ""there's nothing bad about it"" or ""I can quit when I want to,"" and it's super dangerous, especially to first time weed users. It's weird, because a lot of people don't take weed addiction seriously. Is there anyway we can change this mindset?

Maybe because I used to associate everything with being high, but it’s starting to be depressing. I don’t game anymore, even though I think about it a lot, I can’t get past 10 mins or so. I used to listen to audiobooks all the time, and now I don’t. I don’t have that much free time anyway due to full time job, school, and kids but it seems like I found a way before. Now I just come home, do my little exercise routine and then steam a show or movie because it requires no effort. 

I was really excited about the prospect of gaming while sober, because before I felt like it made me suck and also I’d start falling asleep after 30 mins of doing something. I could never remember what I did the last time I played, and same applies to my books. It was a mental chore to jog my memory. 

I know in the long run a month sober isn’t *really* true sobriety so I’m hoping I’m just in a slump. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even like having days off because I have nothing to focus on to take me away from my self pity.

I shared a joint with 3 other guys 10 days ago, realized I didn’t miss it, and am resolved not to touch it again. For background, I’m a 26 yo guy and started smoking off and on at 19. Over the past 3 years is when it became a daily habit, and over the past 1-2 years an obsessive daily habit. I was basically high from the moment I woke up til I went to bed. 

I quit because I realized I had absolutely zero motivation to do anything and had become emotionally numb. My jobs and relationships started to suffer, and I decided to stop smoking completely. One big factor was my sex drive. Although when I’d get high I’d often get hornier (especially when I started smoking), overtime I started having issues with ED. I also got so lazy that I just didn’t have the energy to be interested in sex, which became an issue with my partner (who by the way smoked with me). 

A few months ago I started seeing a urologist to try to figure out what was wrong. My testosterone was on the lower side, especially for my age, but not drastically so. Nevertheless he prescribed a pill that stimulates testosterone production, but advised that my weed habit was a big issue and recommended that I stopped. I basically ignored him for a few months, until I finally agreed that weed was an issue that was more than just messing with my sex drive, and decided to quit completely. 

Despite my slip up 10 days ago, I already feel much better. I started lifting again, spin classes, yoga, am much more organized and punctual, clearer head. I’ve started having dreams every night. The one problem is that my sex drive is even worse than it was when I smoked. Absolutely nothing turns me on. I tried sex, masturbating to porn a couple times, but was literally forcing  myself hoping I’d stimulate my libido. I basically feel like I’ve become asexual. How long until it comes back? I’ve read several threads on here about this but am desperate for more data points and success stories. 

TLDR; everything improving except libido, need reassurance that it will come back sooner than later.",1,0

And now, a month later which was today and the day before yesterday, I broke again and made me realised things. 1) I have changed and the people around me have, it turns out that I was suppressing the fact that I felt so lost, confused ,depressed and unmotivated. The reason I started weed was an emotional “excuse” and made me realised I need to turn a new leaf. 2) I realised this with the help of weed. My sincere apologies but it couldn’t have been without it. Taking these into consideration, I can’t help but admit that weed is equally making me lazy but functional.

I've been cutting back with the speed of 1 joint a day less every week and have finally reached 0 joints a day. It was surprisingly easy until I got to 1 joint a day. I've been sneaking in that second one most days this week. So instead of trying to make myself smoke 1 joint a day for a week I decided to say ""it's been enough, when you run out of joints you aren't getting new ones, straight to 0 a day"".

It has always been clear to me that smoking was a coping mechanism for depression and cptsd; I started smoking explicitly to help me cope. Not saying that was a good idea but it's what happened. I didn't know how to replace it with something healthy for a long time. 

Over the last years I've been doing a lot of trauma work and have worked hard to be able to process my emotions in general. Three months ago I finally started to feel like the negative consequences of being high outweighed the comfort of silencing emotions. I am ready to *feel* now, both the good and the bad, and use my emotions as a source of information rather than seeing them as something to fear.

Today was a lot easier than I thought it would be but I won't lie to you, I'm kind of scared for tomorrow. I'm afraid that I'll find out I'm still unable to cope without weed or that the withdrawal effects will be too much for me.

I'm proud of the progress I have made so far (my bank account is very thankful and I already feel a little clearer), but I want to quit for good. This sub has given me the last push I needed to decide to do it: hope. So many of you are doing so well and I'm proud of y'all. For the others, we're in this together :)

The main reason I quit was because of generalized anxiety disorder I began to develop, and also my life wasn't going anywhere. I did study music composition and dropped it after 2 years, then I studied sociology and dropped it after almost 4 years, then I worked in show production as a producer and the pandemic hit.

Anyway, first-month sleeping was difficult, had many nightmares and stuff. Anxiety decreased each month, but I would say that just now, like 1 month ago it has almost completely fade away.

Three months into quitting I stumble across a website where they teach you to program. I got obsessed. I did three certificates and after three months I took a one and a half month programming Bootcamp. Seven months after learning to program I got my first job, with a higher salary than I ever had in my life, right now I'm almost finishing my 4th month on the job and I've quite a lot of other job offers, one of them I might take next week. This thanks to being actively part of a local developer community. I probably exchanged my weed addiction for a programming addiction, at least this last one has been more productive. Now I'm a bit more chill, but in the first five months  I really did study all day long, I dreamed with code. I also picked the habit of going out for a 30 min run three to four times a week.

What I did set aside is playing piano, I used to play every day, especially high, now it's very occasional. Sometimes I got inspired just as in the old days but without weed, it just isn't as prevalent as before.

About cravings: I guess the first weeks were the hardest but the anxiety was a really good reason to quit smoking, maybe it was my brain telling me, bra, stop it. Sometimes I wonder how it would be to smoke again and just think in an altered state of mind about the journey I've walked this last year. My ""high"" brain doesn't know how to code. I might do it someday, but I know for sure that I won't go back to my old habits. For now, I'm really just focused on my professional development, learning new technologies, and also anxious to know how my non-high and more confident personality will work out when the pandemic is over and go back to a normal social life.

Yeah, so, I don't know exactly what my message is. I had to stop because of the anxiety, so I know many of you out there might not have such a good reason to finally quit, but what I can say, you never know what spontaneously you might pick in your sober state of mind, you might discover something about you that makes you grow. And I know it sounds simplistic, but I guess the only way to quit, is just quitting and to not look back :D

Maybe this post can give you some hope, that change is something to embrace. Hope you all do well and achieve great things.",81,2

If you’re far into sobriety and thinking about smoking just “one time”, please remember that if you’re addicted to something you will most likely get sucked back in if you try to use once. Remember why you quit in the first place. I am addicted to weed and I don’t have control over sweet, manipulative Mary Jane. I’m planning on leaving cold turkey by next week (the end of my school year (I’m a teacher)). This community was a huge help when I quit before and I want to stay involved this time around, too.

I’m a 29 year old woman and have been smoking (heavily) every single day since I was 17. 12 years of my life have been controlled by this plant. 10-15 bong rips per day. Every single day. And the worst part was no one could see it but me. I graduated college with straight As, am a top performer and Director in my software company, own a home by myself, and generally have my shit together. But I was high the whole time. High while on work meetings (I have been working from home for five years). High while with my family. High while at the doctors office. It didn’t matter. And my friends and family would tell me “it’s just weed - you are fine! Look at how successful you are!”

But everyone here knows it’s not fine. My brain was in a constant fog. CONSTANT. I forget absolutely everything. I do not exercise. And I am not even 30 years old.

Today is my second day without weed in twelve years. 2 days might not be much, but I have tried to quit hundreds of times and have never made it this far.

And I have a plan this time: a daily journal, marijuana anonymous meetings, exploring Buddhism which I have always wanted to do, and I bought a treadmill too.

I quit on 4/20 and decided to not look back. I had tried quitting dozens of times before, always trying to have the perfect smoke before I quit. It never worked. On 4/20, I shared my desire to quit with someone who I was going to smoke with and they laughed at me and said ""You'll never be able to do it"" and it was at that moment my resolve solidified.

The first week sucked, I couldn't eat anything and I had so much trouble falling and staying asleep. I got really big into meditation and I started to read about Buddhism and Adwaita Vedanta. The messages I found in these teachings resonated with me - the core teaching which is essentially ""The problem is in your mind"". Just like feelings come and go, so do thoughts. I made the monster out to be far bigger than I thought it was and I underestimated myself on just how much strength I really have.

Coming to this community helped a lot because we're always told that ""weed is non-addictive"" and that it's a panacea for all problems. It's not, it screwed me up, made me paranoid, wasted my time by making stupid time-wasting hobbies enjoyable, and it stole from my relationships. The thing that motivated me the most was how I wasn't living up to my potential. All I really need is shelter, food, water, a loving partner, and maybe a few other things but weed isn't one of them.

I've been having crazy vivid dreams lately but I enjoy them, even the scary ones. I'm learning a lot about the emotions I repressed over the years and I'm learning to deal with them head on, and with great success too. My appetite is back full force, I'm eating healthier and even more than I thought was humanly possible. I started working out and meditating more and these two habits have been so helpful to me.

I'm a lot more focused because I can't sit idle if I'm not high so I have to do or learn something. Somedays I wake up feeling meh but I keep the idea fastened in my mind that, it's all in my head. That my thoughts are transient and I don't need to follow them. This has brought me so much stability. My relationships are healthier, I listen better, people around me notice. I feel like a new person. I'm turning 30 in a few months and I feel like I can't be this way anymore. I can't keep acting like I'm still in college just bullshitting around. Time to grow up. When I have a family and kids, I don't want them to see me high. I don't want that to be the example that I set for them.

I just want to tell you all, I thought I'd never be able to escape this path. I quit drinking a year ago and haven't had a sip since. If I didn't quit drinking I don't know if I'd be able to do this. Anyway.. I just wanted to share my experience with everyone so far and remind you that you can do it. You really can. You're stronger than you think and even the moments that suck will pass. You have to embrace the storm and soon enough the sun will be shining on your head. I'm here to talk if anyone wants to reach out, just send me a private message here.

&#x200B;

Tried to quit 4 times, at least. Decade plus, reaching 3-5g daily, I took two joints with me for a short walk with my dog. Absent, stupid, smelly me, for years. Felt barely anything, but that was the point, I think.

&#x200B;

I spent years **fearing two things - that weed will make my girl leave me, and that it will make me fuck up my job and career.** This stress was killing me and paralyzing me. It was a cloud bigger than the fog in my head.

&#x200B;

I had this idiotic dream, that one day my caring girlfriend slash fiancee will tell me that she will not stay with me, and will leave me if I won't change. I hoped that this would be the spur, the thing that wakes me up. But it was just that - **""Oh, If only she would ask me, I would certainly quit, because I love her""**.

  
And then she did! She cried and she told me how shitty life with me can be, and what a person I became. I cried too. I knew it all, but she finally told it out loud.

&#x200B;

I know this sucks on a number of levels - what I did to her quality of life and to us, how essentially I was waiting for someone else to take responsibility, to push me out of my stupor. It is not a perfect way. It can be shitty if you put this on the wrong person. I still knew then and know now the job is on me, she could only give me the motivation.

  
BUT

&#x200B;

If you share my feeling - that a friend, a parent, a significant other, that they are the key, that they are what would motivate you to quit - please, don't wait for their initiative. I wish I didn't. Tell them exactly that, explain your twisted way of thinking, and ask for help. It may be worth it! They may suffer as much as you think you do.  


What help? In my case, all we did is for her to control my money for a while and for her to wake me up earlier so that I go for a bike ride. Other than that - the spur she gave me was deep in my ass, hurting and reminding myself to endure.

  
So far so good!  


**PS.** First 5 days are the hardest. But the mirage of regaining control is the real killa.  
**PS1.** Physical activity is a monster of a medicine - get fucking sweaty and tired, any way you like. If I move, I don't smoke.  
**PS2.** Engage your friends - who would not help a buddy? I wrote short SMS messages to all my smoking circle - please, don't feed me for a while. Help me, I'm in trouble here.  
**PS3.** Track days - visual representation of your success is a nice little reward... when you forget you even need it. Design a nice chart and place it on your wall to cross off days, I liked the accomplishment of reaching Day 7 (which was REWARD DAY, a boatload of ice cream)  
**PS4.** Therapy did not help me, like, directly with my addiction, as I thought it magically would, but it helped me manage my relationships and be more aware of my cravings.  I think the tools you learn there are valuable. I thought I was too manly for therapy - turns out I wasn't manly enough to do it earlier.",11,0

Damn.,"Good friend was in town from overseas and I had a few drinks. I quit alcohol also when I quit weed, but once every six months or so for a special occasion I will imbibe in a 2-3 drink night, which in and of itself hasn't been a huge problem but I know it is dangerous because it clouds my judgement enough to entertain the idea of smoking weed. 

Decided to take a hitter last night, felt pretty good, was talkative and jovial, didn't have a panic attack like I thought I might. Took another, still felt good, but started to feel pretty self conscious. Took a rip off my roommates vape pen while he drove us home, then started to get a little anxious and quiet and started having really mean, nasty thoughts about myself. Above all else, the entire night, I felt guilty and like I let myself down. 

I wish I had a terrible time and got super anxious and panicked because then I wouldn't be tempted. But it was fine, I had some positive effects from it and some negative affects from it but overall felt fine.

I did have a realization that even though it felt kinda good, it just wasn't serving me anymore. Like I'd ""outgrown"" being high in a way. The high me isn't who I want to be anymore.

Even after this realization, I woke up today wanting to get high again. I'm still tempted by something I know I don't even want.

I realised that I was actually always happier sober, and the only reason why I smoked was to satisfy my cravings. As soon as I would smoke I’d feel like shit; anxiety, guilt, paranoia and just feeling like crap for having once again given in to my cravings.

I had vaped mostly daily for about 4 years, and hoped it would resolve after quitting.  Alas, it has not.  Instead it seems like I’m dealing with chronic shortness of breath, tight chest, headaches, lots of sticky mucus and phlegm, sore back, and sometimes some wheezing.  

My doctor thinks it’s probably asthma.  But I also have GERD and my seasonal allergies seem to keep getting worse (they’re not too bad), and I understand those things can also cause my symptoms and/or they go hand in hand with asthma.

I really regret ever using now, as I keep wondering if I gave myself asthma  (or god forbid something worse) and will have to feel like this forever.  I know this subreddit is focused more on  addiction issues (which I was), but I feel like heath issues are just as important for leavers or those considering becoming leavers. Do any other leavers know if their use of weed caused asthma? Of does it just exacerbate it? 

I get it may be impossible to know for sure, but I would be so very upset with myself if this could have all been avoided if I just stopped earlier or never started at all.",1,0

I am getting help through doctors and a therapist, but that seems like a mask for something I should just embrace. This sub has been amazing, I've tried and will always try to support everyone here, this is just a low moment that I want people to understand and know it's okay to have.

They say it's not about the cards you're dealt but how you play them, I can't help but hate the ones in my hand and wish I could fold. What happens when you don't feel the way you should? Weed used to be the answer. When I should feel motivated, alive and more outgoing, all I feel is sad and weary. Is this what life would've been like without weed anyway? Or are the chemicals in my brain still crying out for me to get high because I abused it for so long? 

I don't know, I don't have any answers, I wrote this to show you all, it's okay to feel bad, you're not alone. It's okay to fall down even after you've picked yourself up already.

I’ll be tired today. I could go and get high, I suppose. But sitting on the toilet listening to the dogs bark and the rain drift down on the wind I realized I would be exhausted either way. I guess that’s comforting. What is a lot more comforting is that this exhaustion can be fixed up with an afternoon nap. I like having that option. I’ll note I didn’t take the option to work out yesterday, or go for a ride or a walk. I didn’t eat right (is fried chicken ever wrong, though?), drink enough water, put enough effort into my life. But I didn’t get high, and maybe right now that’s enough for one day. 

People say they look back and regret all the years they spent stoned. I feel a little of that, sometimes. A few of my blinds were broken. Not many. Three out of some fifty? But they let the light in. I don’t know how many hours of sleep I lost to those three blinds. But I know it was more than three. Maybe more than fifty. It took me half an hour yesterday to fix them. A good job of it, too, no duct tape. Man it wasn’t even just the sleep either. I just put those broken blinds on top of the assembly. Knocked them to the floor, picked them up again I don’t know how many times. Irritating, every time. I regret that. There’s more to fix today.

I’ve been sad a lot lately. Very sad. Sadder than when I broke up with my girlfriend of six years.  Lonely, too. But less angry. No more white hot in an instant. Just a cool, dull poker. And I’ve laughed more too, I think more than when I was getting high. I like that, too. 

Amazon appreciates my sobriety. Plant potters. New clothes. Stupid reviews on stupid kitsch. But it serves me better than pot. 

A friend of mine lives with her ex boyfriend. They broke up a year ago. Actually I was interested in dating her. But she never did move out. It’s an odd arrangement. But I asked her the other day, is it serving you well? Yes. She liked that question. Her mother asks her when ‘she’ll get rid of her friend.’ I liked my question too. But that’s the first question. The easy one. The hard one is - Is this serving you better than anything else? Much harder, that one, maybe impossible to know for sure. But I wonder if it’s like me and pot. A safety net sort of. It served me. But I guess the second question for me wasn’t so hard.

I waited too long I think to join this forum and be part of a community but I think now is the time. I’m a 22 yo man who had a very promising career ruined by extreme marijuana abuse damage now facing chronic withdrawals. I’d like to start off with the first time I ever did drugs, I was 19 and after all my research my teenage self came to the conclusion weed is none addictive and completely safe. So my friend handed me a joint one day when I was 19 and it went from there. At first it was fine, helped me sleep, maybe once every 2 months? Then I got my medical card a few months later and in SOCAL y’all know how easy that is and stuff spiraled. The same friend one day gave me a vape pen, told me to take a 30 second rip and hold it in till i cant anymore. I’ll never forget how extreme that high was and that’s the day I became an addict (while ofc during the high telling myself I’ll never do it again). So... months of daily constant vaping reaching points of 1 gram carts a day. Then from there when my lungs were destroyed and I couldn’t even feel it anymore I went to moon bars and other edibles. Tolerance became a massive issue because unless I was fucking slurring and in different planets i didn’t even want to live or consider it a high. 100MG turned to 1000 to 2000. I was gorging down disgusting amounts of moon bars at a time (or sometimes id buy 2 1/8ths decarb them and eat them on peanut butter it was gross) and chugging tinctures meant for 30 days all at once daily. Had to fast for multiple days then eat the bar just to feel them (I have no idea how the mind can get this addicted to a substance to do this to itself). Lost my mind several occasions in ways if I write em down here I’d be locked up so I can’t believe I’m still semi sane. I remember the last day I ate 6 moon bars chugged a “dreamt” tincture smoked an eighth of Chem Dawg and still didn’t feel my “high”. $150 in one day that was to feel nothing but sadness. I’ve quit previously for 28 days and by day 10 I was fine but the urges were there (this is before the insane fiend gorges I listed bare in mind). Keep in mind I’m 5’6 130 lbs @ 10% BF so a very small guy. So back to it, at that last day of spending $150 to feel nothing I decided to cold turkey as I noticed I was developing bumps and my entire esophagus was inflamed, I couldn’t taper. 2 weeks into the withdrawals I came down with a sudden migraine with auras, AND caught COVID when my lungs were destroyed (not fun). The worst headaches you can imagine came out of no where. Hospital visit after hospital visit of freaking out I’m gonna die after 1 month sober (in my head I’m thinking how can I still have withdrawals). 7 CAT scans one MRI and a botched lumbar puncture showed increased white matter infront of my brain but that’s it and they won’t even explain that. My neurologist says chronic migraines so I’m rolling with that. ANY prescription medicine I tried to ease the pain after like prescription Medication or whatever tf they gave me made me worse or addicted to that (not the doctor's fault of course, experimentation). My hospital visits essentially sent me back into addiction. Now I’m back clean 1 month, heads doing slightly better, shimmering vision, flickering lights constantly, seeing lots of purple aura but ONE DAY this will end I hope. I read other substance addicts having problems for years it’s only right that I should as well. There’s so much more I can write about but this is messy enough and I’m on the toilet lol. Thanks for reading this y’all. Be strong, it’s very hard, control the anxieties and be strong and don’t touch the devil’s lettuce. There's so much more I just can't bunch it into here but basically ANY withdrawal symptom you can imagine aside from a seizure I had and went through so if you are as well please feel free to message me anytime or comment down, sorry for the cluster.   


TLDR: Extreme abusers... it take's a LONG time even if you are very low body fat and physically fit but you have to make sure you stay off all substances and give it months maybe YEARS before you're back to normal, don't expect a normal 7-14 day hell. DON'T even think about maybe this didn't do it to you something else did that's not true, trust me I experimented enough and I was VERY fit, stable, and strong before all this.

I've been here on and off for quite awhile (shocker: sticking to quitting is hard!) and I'm currently on day 6. I have had a lot of brief periods of sobriety (days, weeks, even a couple months here and there but never after such high consumption), and this has been by far the most difficult. I wanted to share my story because it has been so helpful to read all of yours. 



I've been consuming cannabis for about ten years, which started as a very light and social consumption until I went through a very traumatic series of life events. PTSD, night terrors, anxiety, depression...weed was one of the only ways for me to get out of my head/feel good/numb myself/stop my nightmares. Unfortunately the cure became it's own disease, and as I consumed more cannabis to cope I would feel more and more anxious and depressed (and so I would smoke more to cope with feeling bad, which would make me feel more bad, just a terrible feedback loop to be in). I really tried to regulate my consumption so I could be sharp enough to meet my educational and career goals, but that fell apart with the pandemic and a triggering event for my PTSD. After many years of hard work and struggling to save enough money, I got into the graduate program of my dreams, and I still could not quit. I was smoking more than ever, feeling worse about myself than ever, and feeling enormous guilt because weed was clearly having a negative impact on my academic performance and social skills. My first year I killed myself to maintain a 3.87, but I was an absolute wreck and hated myself. Now I am heading into my second year and I am determined to heal, to take care of myself, and be kind to my body. I set up therapy appointments (which is scary, my trauma is extremely hard for me to talk about and it's hard for me to open up to anyone, especially a stranger) and went cold turkey (from about 2g/day of high concentration cali weed) as soon as my finals were over. During the past week I also moved to a new place in a better setup for my goals (I have a decked out workout room now and an outdoor space for that vit D) as a sort of fresh start. I've been vomiting multiple times a day from severe nausea (lost 9 munchie lbs) and feeling so anxious I want to crawl put of my skin, but I do feel more clear-headed already. When I'm not unpacking or feeling like I'm dying, I've been taking better care of myself (going on walks, meditating, brushing my teeth twice a day). I never want to go through such terrible withdrawals again, and that is a big thing keeping me from relapsing. I feel like absolute shit but for the first time in a long time I feel hope that I can get better.



To everyone that shared their stories here: I truly couldn't do this without the knowledge, support, and inspiration you have provided. I am SO grateful for this community. To anyone that took the time to read my novel: thank you for seeing me, and please feel free to reach out with any questions or advice. 



Tl;dr: cannabis helped a lot with my mental illness until it didn't. Withdrawals are slaying me but that is fueling my desire to stay sober so I never have to feel this way again. Big thank you to all the leavers on here, y'all are my heroes.",49,1

I walk outside (busy crowd, all NPCs, nobody of interest) and it starts to get dark and the dread starts to kick in, the fear of being left for dead with nobody I know or want to be around.

I consider that I will have to just give up and walk into town in the pitch black 10 miles, and then a caravan owner says to me ""Watch out for that thing in the bins"" and I knew this refers to some sort of cryptid.

I panic more, I can feel the dread building higher and higher.

I start walking around and I see my parents in their WW2 Land Rover Defender (which they don't own and never have), parked round the back of a caravan, with my siblings and.. yes you guessed it.. Mr Stroll himself in his full pink Racing Point race suit, smiling at me like hes genuinely happy to see me.

I tell him to f*** off and kick him out.

Then I wake up... so that's it guys, thanks for reading what my subconscious thinks!",3,0

I am now celebrating 7 months sober! I am very happy that I made it this far and I hope to make it much further.

 I've noticed many things have changed about my daily experience since quitting; reduced anxiety, better focus, more energy and more enthusiasm for things that aren't weed.
But I've also noticed an extreme drop off in my libido. Like a total 180 switch. Right before quitting I had a very high libido and now absolutely nothing, not even the desire to masturbate.

Anyways i got finals coming in a few days and im underprepared. I know I should I should do something about it but cant seem to muster the will power to do much of anything. I work full time, go to school, and work out and feel like weed was my me time. Now im finding new ways to get my me time. 

Im waking up earlier, dreams are freaking awesome but intense sometimes (pro imo), better relationships, less anxiety, better ability to hold eye contact. All of these positives. 

However weed was the carrot on the stick for me to push through my day, now i don't have that carrot. Even if i had to push through lack of focus and memory problems.  I know my life is and will continue to get subjectively and objectively better. But this dip in motivation / willpower is coming at a bad time it feels like. I don't think i should've postponed quitting though, because this week always turns into next week and so on. 

Im a smart dude and passing my finals is pretty much a given. But getting the grade that fits my desires and ego is another thing. Also i have been working out 5-6 days a week, which on paper sounds awesome but i feel like they shouldve been longer or it shouldve been 7 days. Im ""shoulding"" all over myself. 

Just wanted some of your guys experiences and opinions. Its also good to get this stuff on paper (or screen)  thanks guys. This community has been paramount to my sobriety.  

I kinda just want to take today slow and enjoy life. Do a little studying but its one of my days off and I haven't spent much time with my sober self. Also I had a dream i got rejected by this girl i used to be really into which hits close to home because it happened in real life too.

It was no longer fun to smoke, and it had changed me in ways I wasnt very happy about, to say the least. 
So last night before my therapy session today, I dreamt I sent my dealer a text that I wanted to get some weed. He wrote back something I couldn’t understand, and after I asked him what he meant, he sent a picture of a butt. Somehow I knew what he meant, and I checked my ass only to find a bit of plastic sticking out of it. I knew it was the weed, but couldnt get it out so I went to the toilet and shat it out. There it was, in the bowl surrounded by plastic wrapping, covered in shit but still intact. 
Talking about this dream today in my therapy session, I realized this was a representation of my struggle with quitting weed, and how dynamic the process is. I’ve only smoked 3 times in the past 13 months since starting therapy, and now I’m emptying the last pieces of the addiction that are stuck in my bowels. But I don’t flush it down, which means I am still hanging on to the temporary paradise of weed, which I think is characteristic for all drugs.

492,2021-05-20 13:22:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nh6358/chose_weed_over_romance_vent/,Chose Weed over Romance (Vent),"I was listening to a podcast the other day with Paul Austin where he talked about ""parenting, polyamory, interconnectedness"" and more. He talked about his relationship with his beautiful wife, and how much they've grown together by doing the hard things while committed to each other and as a family.

Since I was 15, weed was my best friend. Countless times I'd be connecting with a guy I really liked or who really liked me, when an opportunity to smoke with my friends would come up. And I'd bail on him! Or if I felt like it may go somewhere, I'd panic, go home, and get high by myself.

Deep down, I just didn't think it was possible for anyone to love me and certainly for me to love anyone as much as I loved weed. I'd always hear people say, especially guys, ""I just want to marry my best friend"". I just didn't think that was even possible. But then I got older and saw it happen over and over again - best friends coupling up and it WORKING.

Now that I'm almost 6 months sober and on the other side of my 30's, I feel lonelier than ever. The pandemic has been hard enough, but now that I'm starting to see my friends all coupled up again, I feel so fucking hopeless. I'm still going to stay sober, but I recently started reflecting on all those missed opportunities for romance and love. All cause it was easier and safer to get high. And because I was afraid of rejection and a dumb undiagnosed autistic fuck, I thought I had to be perfect before I could be with someone seriously. 

It breaks my heart to think of how I could've grown old with someone, maybe we could've quit weed together, and now it's too late and I've completely fucked up the opportunity. I'm so fucking pissed at myself and heartbroken. 

I thought weed would never reject me. Turns out, weed was causing me to reject myself all along.

I thought weed was helping me feel less lonely. But in the end, it just left me old and alone.

I know that it's better to stay away from weed completely, and a small part of me is proud of myself for quitting even if it's super fucking late. But I'm still just so sad.",17,1

It smells like I personally am the one smoking in there, even though it's definitely someone below me.

I had been doing great cravings wise, but every time I smell the bathroom I get an intense urge to use again. Plus I thought the days of worrying about my bathroom smelling when I have guests over were behind me. Now I can't even control when it happens.

I live in a semi-legal state (medical use only) and smoking indoors is strictly against our lease, which leads me to believe that they don't have a medical card like I do.

i came to the conclusion that those people didn't really have the support system that i have. my family is always there for me, especially since i started to break free from addiction to support me in any way they could. my partner quit at the same time as i did so we could support one another too.
those ""friends"" i was talking about either have abusive or distant families that don't support them in the way mine does. 

i was wondering if that could have something to do with not being able to break free from addiction?
obviously in in the end it's entirely up to oneself if you take the final step and decide for yourself to quit, but i feel like it's even harder to do it if there's nobody that has your back.

i would love to hear y'all's thoughts about this!",5,0

I started smoking at 16 and it quickly became an everyday thing. Everything from flower to edibles and even a few lengthy wax phases. I'm now 23 and going on my fifth year of college, because I have spent the better part of my life stoned. 24/7. I used to be much more functional and able to control myself (like only smoking on the weekend) and these past two years I've lost friends, a girlfriend and most importantly any and all interest in the things I used to love. I've spent days on end not even leaving my room, sleeping for 16 hours and smoking just to go back to sleep... I think a lot of the stories I've read have been uncomfortably relatable and I'm ready to search for myself again. 

I am approaching the end of day three and this is what I've experienced so far. I haven't slept more than 1-3 hours a night, I constantly wake up feeling feverish and sweating all over the place, I've lost 9 pounds in three days because I cannot eat a damn thing, I have hot flashes constantly and I think the worst part is each morning I get out of bed I throw up bile until I my stomach feels like a folded envelope. I'm terrified of how long this is going to last, because my body is physically deteriorating. Alternatively, the only reason I've made it three days is I finally have these bursts of sociability, like just enjoying a casual conversation with a stranger that I haven't felt in years. I already feel a little bit clearer mentally and it is the only reason I'm hanging on still. I do believe I can get better but it's a scary thing, man. 

Does anyone have advice on handling the physical affects? And experience seeing memory improve after quitting? I've always heard the memory affects aren't permanent but can take some time to recover. Thanks guys, even just typing all of this feels a little relieving.",1,0

I want to see how quitting smoking weed is going to affect me in my pursuit of my short/medium/long term goals. Keeping the focus on too many goals would be too much so I am going to start of with one of my main visually measurable goals and maybe add others if and once I see progress with this:

* A well defined 6 pack

**Where do i stand with it?**

I lost my 6 pack at the start of covid and have been see sawing between the way i look in my current condition and maybe an additional 10-15 pounds of body fat. Usually at this point it plateaus because I start eating like crap after smoking weed. So I'm going to post a photo daily as a means to keep me accountable to not smoke. Starting tomorrow I will also be posting my caffeine intake, meditation streak, and unproductive screen time using a chrome extension and phone usage monitor.

Loneliness and boredom were no match

Depression and PTSD were made to yelp 

However the time has come and I must detach.

It is time for me to grow

While it started out great

The benefits reached a plateau 

I now see the negatives are not up for debate. 


Dear Cannabis,

Without you, I will be able to conquer 

For your haze will no longer have me blind

Soon I will regain my honor 

And my life will not be undermined.

Smoking has made missing classes and failing semesters OK in my mind. Its made me forget the sacrfices I've made to be here and loose sight of the end goal.

First issue is I don’t want to passively inhale any thc. Second is that I don’t want us to grow apart - partly due to I expect I will get some kind of superiority complex where I associate any behaviour I don’t enjoy to her smoking when it could not be down to that. 

I really don’t want it to come between us and worry that I will find it triggering and it will cause arguments or that she will find it boring that I don’t smoke and will want a bf she can smoke and chill with like we used to.

I've found in my experience, that I have more self-criticalness and negativity for relapsing, even if it was somewhat an okay experience.

\-Most likely you'll be anxious and scatterbrained while high and may be regretful for smoking

\-Having ""just one"" smoke will give you more thoughts about smoking and you will have to deal with them for a while, even if you've been sober for months. There will be urges, and there will be self-talk that might try to justify smoking just a little more

\-Your life will be pretty much the same whether or not you smoke, but there's a chance you might feel like you just went backwards after a relapse. Your problems are still there, your escapism patterns that are wired in your brain are still there, and so there's tendency to go back to old patterns

\-It's easier to keep going than to take the detour of trying to smoke again. It's more painful to ""get the train rolling"" once you stop the momentum. Urges may be more frequent for a while

\-You'll also be immediately more hazy the next day, more sluggish, more stuck in your head.

&#x200B;

I don't know about your experiences, but for me smoking feels a bit off nowadays. 5 days ago I bought 0,5g and had some weed the first time in 4 months. I only smoked a little, but already did it for 4 days in a row, even though I was telling myself every morning ""I feel so hazy, I really don't want to smoke today as well"" but it's just really easy to do it. I think it's partly from the lack of direction in life, and fear of failure of achieving something great. It's easier to just smoke and do pretty much nothing than to exert effort into learning or working toward something.

Don't take my word for it, but I don't recommend relapsing, if you were considering trying it out. It's always rather bland and chances are that you will feel bad about doing it.",28,0

On the surface, that should be enough right there for you to quit. But your mind isn't going to let you off the hook that easy. Marijuana addicts are different from addicts of all other more socially stigmatized, and dangerous drugs, because their deterioration is occurring at a substantially slower rate. To the point that on a day to day basis, it may even be hard to see. It's only when you reflect back on months or years at a time that you begin to see what your addiction has taken from you: drive, spirit, personality, people.

Addicts of all kinds will justify their use to themselves, but marijuana addicts take it to a new level. From pop culture references (Seth Rogen became successful, so can I!) to the fundamentally untrue creativity myth, there are a million different ways you can tell yourself that your problems do not boil down to your marijuana use. Rather, it's something else in your life that needs tweaking.

Don't wait as long as I did to look at myself honestly in the mirror and address the root of (most) of my problems. I could spend 10,000 more words reflecting back on how a popular, interactive, and ambitious kid was reduced to a shell of himself because he'd rather spend time in his apartment getting high than stepping out of his comfort zone and seeing what sorts of potential could be unlocked. That potential is there for all of you, but not all of you are going to unlock it. It takes someone incredibly determined and fully awake to come to that realization -- that your problems are a manifestation of your addiction. And more importantly, the problems that aren't can't be addressed properly because retreating back into a bowl or a dab is not an effective method of coping.

Step into the next chapter of your life and don't waste as many crucial years as I did. I'm telling you -- life is better on the other side.",141,0

Can anyone relate?,"Last month I tried quitting for two weeks and it worked, at the end I was always feeling much energized and happy. Then I started smoking again once I finished my exam period, but now I want to quit again.

Reasons for this are multiple, but mostly it's the way weed makes me feel and the impact it has on my relationship with people.
I used to enjoy smoking weed when I started about 4 years ago, but now it has become no more than a slightly numbness in my head. When I'm high I have zero will to do anything, most of the time I feel sleepy and lazy, even if I'm usually a very active person. People always told me weed enhances ur creativity. For me this is straight bs, but I understand weed impacts everyone differently. I've also noticed that when I'm around new people and I've smoked weed I tend to be on my own even if I'm a very social person.
Let's no talk about the day after I smoke.. I feel depressed as shit and the only thing I can think about is when I'm going to light up the next one.
And for all this time I've spent sooo much money on weed that I'm scared to even make the calculations.

I just feel like there are so many things I'm missing out when I smoke, and I want to get back control of my life, this is going to be hard especially because a lot of people around me smoke on the regular, but I hope I'll make it.

and i got more and more depressed too. i felt so alone, so lonely and so ashamed. i tried quitting multiple times bt i failed bcs i didnt know how to exactly. i didnt know how to get through this because weed addiction isnt discussed enough or often dismissed as if it isnt real. so i thought i must be so weak to get addicted to weed that it’s embarrassing so i kept it to myself.

although what concerns me the most right now is my brain condition. i feel like weed has dumb me down and im not as sharp as i was years ago. my memory is shit too. i just graduated law school and i feel so terrified that i dont have the capacity to become someone successful anymore. im so afraid because being one means being quick on your feet. im delaying my career because of it. will it ever get better? will i ever be smart and sharp again? im scared and its haunting me

I have stopped using cannabis distillate for approximately 2 days. These past few days, I have been faced with multiple mental and physical withdrawal symptoms that I would like to share to kind of get an Idea of what it is like to stop after about 1 solid month of use.

What ultimately started this dreaded “roller coaster” of symptoms, was an anxiety/panic attack. I started to think about how I’m starting college soon and how I couldn’t get a job because a majority of jobs drug test. I also found out that the school I’m going to performs random drug tests. I started to feel like I was useless and that I wasn’t going to amount to anything in life. 

I started overthinking every aspect of my life and how I treat my family, friends, and peers. My anxiety got so bad I started crying uncontrollably. This led into a sleepless night that I would not wish upon any other human. 

After that night I decided I needed to quit. I threw away the last of my carts and got rid of anything I had that was associated with weed. This was only the beginning. 

Right after I disposed of my paraphernalia, I had another breakdown. I cried even harder than the night before. Overthinking how I was a failure and how I wasn’t living up to a higher standard or fuller potential. 

One thing I can say. If you quit Marijuana, I suggest talking to someone face to face if you can. When I quit smoking, I felt like I was alone. Having my mother there to talk to was definitely helpful. She gave me a lot of encouragement and she helped me cope with my anxiety.

I decided to take a trip to go see my sister and brother in law. Ever since I’ve been here I have barely eaten anything at all. The only thing I can manage to keep down are fluids. Even as I’m typing this, I have no feeling of hunger, only nausea. Even when I tried to just eat, I only got a few small bites down before I started to feel sick. I ended up puking what minuscule portions I ate. 

Sleeping is my only escape of the withdrawal, that is if I can go to sleep without sweating and dwelling on negative things. My dreams have consisted of me smoking weed in some form and waking up to realize it was only a dream. 

Other than sadness, I haven’t really felt anything. I feel like a shell of who I used to be. The world seems to be different than it usually is. 

I know that with time I will get better, as this isn’t my first rodeo. But this time I want to quit for good. My experiences with weed have not made my life better in any aspect. There is no silver lining in any sort of drug abuse. I can assure myself, as well as anyone else reading this, that there is a light at the end of this tunnel.

""me? oh no, never, i'll never be able to. but you do you.""

there was a time in my life when i thought that weed was the only thing that gave me even the slightest bit of happiness. 
i was severely depressed and suicidal and heavily addicted. i was probably nowhere near as deep in as some of you all had been but i did start smoking daily at 16. i kept smoking until a few weeks after my 21st birthday. 
i had to start dealing to be able to consume as much as i had needed to function, that amount became more and more over the years.

one day i woke up to the cops knocking on my door, i was still absolutely knocked out from having smoked way too much the night before. i was in absolute shock, i knew i had fucked up, i tried to hide as much of my stash as i could and let them in. they didn't find everything but still found quite the amount and i'm still waiting for my trial. thankfully most of what they found was cbd so i don't think i'll be facing such a great penalty but i'm still scared. 
to this day on i'm still scarred from that experience, sometimes i get flashbacks and feel such an immense fear. but i grew stronger from it. i'm not sure what exactly it was but that was the wake up call that i had needed. it could've been so much worse for me and i'm glad what needed to happen happened at the time that it did. i could've had much more weed at home, i could've had weed that was actually high in thc which would give me an even worse penalty. 

it opened up my eyes for me. a few days later on may 19th at 6am was the last time i had smoked a bowl. on that very same day i threw away my last piece that i had bought after the cops had taken away all of my other pieces.

since then i managed to start my own business as a side hustle, i've started university, started working out regularly again, and probably the most important thing: i made up with my family. my bond to my parents is probably the best it has been in years. i'm so grateful for everything that has happened and i'm grateful i was strong enough to go that very step into the right direction.

on this very day, one year ago, i chose to live.",64,0

I find the difficult part has been that my emotions are much more real now than they were before. I find I am angry more often whereas before marijuana would give me the “fuck-its”. You know, any problem was solved by a joint and me thinking “fuck-it”. Now my anger is exhausting... someone pissed me off 3 years ago and I’m still pissed....

Whenever I get the urge I:
-Remind myself that the feelings of shame and disappointment will harm me much more than the urges that come and go, and that the thirty minutes to an hour of being stoned isn’t worth my sobriety and happiness within myself and my life.
-write down all of my feelings
-write down my “whys” for quitting/how it negatively impacts me
-write down my goals
-do mindful meditations on self compassion and kindness, also there are some awesome ones for urges and addiction!
-get outside in the sunshine 
-workout and get very sweaty!
-do art

I’ve found my biggest struggle to be fighting the thoughts like “oh just one night wouldn’t hurt” and when this happens I say to myself “the past shows otherwise, many many times”
In life we will be met with the same lessons and obstacles over and over again until we conquer them. 
Break the cycle.

I also as of yesterday- like to listen to people and their reasonings on why they quit and how it’s affected them mentally and physically (on YouTube) while working out. It may sound a little silly, but it’s been really helpful.


Most of all, remember that you have absolutely everything you need within you to conquer this battle within yourself. Think of yourself before you ever even smoked and coped with weed. Think about that genuine happiness. Think about the motivation, strength, and self appreciation you will be filled with.
Think about how each day is closer to where you want to be, -even if you stumble a few times before finally quitting for good. I stumbled many times and had I been more kind and compassionate with myself- I think things would have gone smoother. 
Most of all, give yourself credit for all of the good you’ve done already in your life, give yourself credit for each storm you’ve gotten through.

the crazy thing about weed is that it isn’t destroying my life. In fact, I’ve been perfectly fine with it with a 3.8gpa and playing two varsity sports. The problem is that it makes me okay with my current life. I’ve been content doing the bare minimum, then going to hang out with friends and smoke weed - it was the highlight of my day. I never really strived to get better because at the end of the day, I could seek the extreme comfort that weed provides me.

along with that, I’ve come to realize weed has ZERO short term consequences except for maybe getting winded quickly. everything bad that it would do to me is long term, and I’ll never notice the difference if I keep getting high.

I’ve always wondered how much better mentally and physically I would be without weed. truth is, I don’t know, and nobody else knows until I decide to say goodbye to the drug. I think it’s finally time to figure out my real potential.

I’ve learned that while I love this drug so much, it’s not for me anymore. when I’m high, I’m content with where I’m at. I always have Mary Jane to turn to whenever things get rough. I’m quickly learning that sober me has a passion, a flame inside me to do better. I’m not in control of weed anymore, it controls me. it’s time to do better, because I know I’m so much more than this drug.

it’s time I take back control of my life.",60,0

I always admired J Cole for being one of the only rappers to tell it like it is. So many rappers and people in society claim that weed helps your relax and be happy. But in my experience, it only created more problems for myself. 

I grew up in a toxic family and I developed anger issues at a young age. I would take out my anger on family and weed was the only thing to help me to calm down. But all it did was help me numb the pain and bury any emotions. 

I thought emotions were a waste of time but they are important to understand your emotional health. When I’d smoke weed, it would cause me to ignore my emotions in return for a temporary high. This would only work in the short term though as I eventually reached my breaking point.

My mental health was in the gutter for years, while weed made me bury my emotions more and more. I’m now 24, been smoking since 15 and I’m realizing my life is boring. I don’t have any friends left, I burned all my bridges as I’d let my anger out. Nobody wants to see that. 

It’s embarrassing because I know weed isn’t to blame but it made it difficult to want to make changes. It made me comfortable being a loner and not having any hobbies or skills. Now I’m finally seeing reality and it makes me sad that this is what my life has become.

I’m moving back home from college soon and I couldn’t be more worried. I had some friends in college but not back home. Combine that with my toxic family and it’s a recipe for relapse. I don’t want to start again though because who knows when I’d quit again. I’m tired of living this empty lifestyle.",7,0

Although withdrawals from marijuana are not close to those from other drugs, seeing just how much a crippling addiction can fuck up a life really weighed on me.

Yesterday marked my 60 day milestone and as a continuation of my [30 day post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/mtcb99/30_days_of_weed_sobriety_what_ive_learned_so_far/), I would like to take this opportunity to again reflect on my thoughts & experiences with weed sobriety.

The background for my situation was covered more in my previous post, so I'll instead focus on the what I've learned / actions taken parts.

&#x200B;

At day 60 of my journey, I have learned:

* The guilt & shame of ""how I got here"" is still the catalyst for not wanting to smoke anymore and continues to completely shut down my cravings. The bad memories are still to raw to ignore.
* Without the mental sedation THC brings, all of my life problems are (and always have been) *real*. There's no hiding from them anymore, and facing that with courage and vigor is a constant effort.
* There's a sort of honeymoon period with self-improvement that begins to wane over time, especially when results that depend on feelings & emotions may not be noticeable. To counter this, I've become even more focused on goal setting - everyday becoming dedicated to ""checking boxes""
* Vivid and jarring dreams eventually taper off to what I would consider ""normal dreaming"". The quality of my dreams are now predicated on my subconscious and not exacerbated by withdrawal.
* My perspective lens on the world has drastically shifted back toward the positive and my mind is much more willing and able to accept mindfulness as a habit when stress rears its ugly head.
* Willpower and impulse control get stronger each day. The “I Don’t Wannas” in my mind are now defiantly met with spite in the form of action to the contrary. If I don't want to workout -> I workout. If I don't want to clean -> I immediately clean. A big ol' middle finger to that voice every time it even tries to lead me astray by thinking it knows best for me.
* I still experience brain fog on a regular basis but at seemingly random moments. Forget a name here, a word there, etc. but overall there is still a sense of feeling intellectually ""dulled"".
* My sense of identity is still a huge work in progress and while 2 months is a decent chunk of time, it's still far from what's needed to rebuild that into an image I can be proud of.
* I'm WAYYY better at video games that rely on strategy or reaction time. Tiny victory, but feels good.

&#x200B;

To keep motivated and continue on the weedless path of sobriety, I try to:

* Use fitness as my main source of visible achievement. Mental & emotional improvement might take months/years, but longer run distances, higher max weights, changing body measurements only take days/weeks to see progress.
* Adhere to a well-defined schedule, where every day becomes that check list and boosts productivity. After a few weeks, it starts to become a game of sorts where the end of my day sets up the ""game"" for tomorrow.
* Immerse myself in my art as well as explore new creative outlets I never would have tried before.
* Continue attending therapy on a regular basis, as it not only help me with the issues of what led to me smoking for years, but also provides tools for dealing with life as it is now and the transition from stoner to successful adult.
* Normalize wellness exercises into my life. I meditate every morning, read every evening, journal daily, hike weekly, and incorporate yoga into my fitness regimen. It REALLY helps get me through the bad days when I force myself to do these things for self-love's sake.
* Absorb the life experiences of others and the wisdom that can be gleaned from them. Whether it's through books, videos, talking to people directly, or even browsing posts on this subreddit, there is genuine commonality beyond myriad of differences from one life to another.
* Take on opportunities without personal bias for the sake of learning new skills. Where once I would scoff at things I thought were ""beneath me"", now I'm proud to be a Graphic Designer/Delivery Driver/Library Clerk/Dog Walker/Homebuilder/Dishwasher/Water Treatment Trainee/Product Scanner
* Strictly budget my money, especially as I continue to look for sustainable full time work now able to pass drug tests. I can't get back the tens of thousands of dollars I've spent on weed in my life, but I can earn it back in less time with the right saving habits.

&#x200B;

As always, a huge thank you to this amazing community for the daily source of inspiration. Hope that these reflections can contribute to that pool of awesomeness and help someone else out there. There's no doubt in my mind that while my life is more difficult at the moment, I'm a MUCH improved human being from who I was 60 days ago.

It's all worth it! *We’re all worth it!*

Look forward to sharing with you all again at Day 90!",78,0

There to fool me into thinking I wasn't depressed while making my depression worse. First time I quit was when I was 24 while at a Tibetan monastery where I had no option to smoke. It was extremely difficult for about a week and after that it became much easier. After going home I began to smoke again a few months later and realized very quickly how negatively it impacted my life. I struggled and struggled and quit again for a year until the next time I went to Asia. At that point I was hanging out with some Nepalese guys and they offered me some hash. I didn't think anything of it cuz I had smoked so much in my life. Little did I know that this would lead me back to the exact patterns I've been living most of my adult life and since then I have not been able to quit again. The quarantine made it harder, breaking my foot made it harder, being in a damaged relationship made it harder. Eventually this self-propelling conundrum appeared. this idea that I knew I would never be able to achieve the things I wanted to achieve as long as I continued smoking and I would never be able to improve in my relationships or in my own personal growth as long as I continued smoking however every time I stop smoking I was in so much pain that I would hurt people around me. So I keep smoking... Now because my lack of motivation and my lack of ability to complete basic tasks has left me so depressed and so much so a shell of my former self that my girlfriend left me, my friends barely recognize me, my father doesn't speak to me, my mother is compassionate but doesn't understand, and all of my friends are such stoners that they don't get how weed is negatively impacting my life and growing away from it seems impossible.

It honestly hasn't been inherently bad - I've maintained high grades, work out every day, eating well and a part time job 20hrs/week all while smoking every day since last March (with the exception of a month long break). However, after accidentally taking a one day break, my stomach was bloated and something told me that the weed is starting to affect my body negatively. On top of that, I've felt down lately due to life stuff and I think it's good to give my brain a break to breath and evaluate my emotions before I spiral to depression. 

So heres my problem. I can quit for a day or two. Past that is where I struggle. By the end of the second day, I feel SO BORED. Listening to music, surprisingly, does not help. So, for any veterans on here, can someone give me ideas on what to replace my weed time with? How do I get past the few days of boredom? I've quit for months in the past but summer is approaching and I can't just glue myself to a textbook to fill my time like I did before. ANY HELP IS APPRECIATED!! Also, how do I cure these nasty withdrawal headaches and nausea?",1,0

I've thrown away all my stuff and cut off my access to it, but that doesn't help with the pain right now. I did quit cold turkey.",4,0

Was a smoker for 12 years and I was so stoked to hit the year mark of sobriety last month. Been able to tack on another month and I have had some positives and gains since how I felt at day 1. The killer tho that still lingers is brain fog, my memory is still bad and have times of still feeling lethargic. It’s a bummer bc the brain fog and bad memory is just a constant reminder of the mistake of being so addicted to smoking weed for the amount of time I did. It got to the point that I didn’t even enjoy smoking and it even made me paranoid and like crap, but once I got down from the high my brain was just craving it so hard and I would smoke again. I’m so grateful for finally giving up and the amount of time I have stayed sober, but still bumming me out with the last few problems I have. Still going to stay far away from it and continue this journey and am looking forward to hopefully being close to 100% that I can.

I’m bipolar type 2, and my normal emotional baseline since I am unmedicated is lower than most. It’s not a lack of really anything, I love my girlfriend, my family life is great, I have a great opportunity ahead of me in the job market, but in general I just struggle. In the past I used to numb myself with weed to bypass this emotional baseline, but now that I’m sober it’s something I’m revisiting and I’m revisiting head on. I’m not going to lie it fucking blows, but I’m not regressing back to smoking. One I need a new job, and two this is my mind and body telling me that things need to change in my life in order to raise that emotional baseline, and smoking weed only offsets that problem for as long as you stay high for. I don’t eat right, I don’t exercise, and my reality is just that, because I’m not treating my body well, I’m not going to feel well. Don’t regress, and ignore your tasks at hand, don’t ignore the messages your body sends you, listen and fight the good fight. I’m not going to lie and say I’m singing up for a gym this second, and going to instantly feel better, but this is a war you go through, and if you want to win at life you gotta fight to the bitter end.

As the title states, I'm on day 47.

I will try to keep this short.

Yes it has been extremely positive, and I never want to turn back. I am firm and adamant about continuing forward with my recovery, regardless of how difficult it gets.

I did have a few questions for whoever feels they can offer me some insight:

- The first 2-3 three weeks I slept liked a baby. Now I can't sleep a wink. I go to bed at the same time. Drink a tisane. Try to avoid screens. Yet I feel like my eyelids won't stay shut and I haven't slept in 3 weeks or something. Is it normal for sleep to get worse before it gets better? 
- My stress levels have rocketed to a sky-high level, to the point where I can't tolerate tipping over a fork without crying profusely. I spent my weekend enduring meltdown after meltdown, feeling more exhausted than when the weekend started.

A little background, I have been diagnosed and struggling with mental health issues since the age of 13 (smoking every day since 17. I am 24 now). Some professionals disagree with certain diagnoses, etc. That translates into ""I have no idea if there is really something else at play here, or if I'm perfectly fine and just had a rough past in the medical system and it's in my head / need to try harder.""

I know my symptoms have been getting worse since quitting, I expected it. I guess I'm wondering if everyone that quits goes through similar turmoil. (I know everyone is different but maybe the majority won't have several meltdowns kicking and screaming and accidentally hurting themselves.) for some time my therapist believed I could be autistic or have ADHD but without proper evaluation I won't know.

(Not here asking for diagnosis or medical advice.)

Additionally, I can't handle work. Luckily I've been able to convince my boss to let me work from home (due to Covid) but he complains about how he can't manage me working remotely and keeps begging me to come back. Right now with all these meltdown and lack of sleep, I feel working from home is helping me manage to keep my job while taking care of myself. I dont want to tell him the truth but Im tired of being pressured. 

I am seeing my doctor in two weeks, but unfortunately my therapist is unavailable until June 25th.

Any advice, insight?

I've been here so many times before and I've relapsed every time but this one feels different. I think the key is building new routines for when you'd normally smoke. I normally smoked in the morning and at night. Now in the mornings I feed the birds that live in my garden and spend some time with them. Night is still tricky, but nowhere near as hard as I remember it being every other time I've tried to quit.

Build new routines and habits guys it helps a lot. At least for me.

I'm 23, and started smoking regularly at 21 due to COVID & loneliness (needed something to fill the void), I couldn't do any work without being stoned. 

I quit for 50 days at the end of last year, made amazing progress on my business and work until January/February - started smoking weekends again and then it became everyday. 

I have made some STUPID business decisions while being stoned and lost $5,000 to poor products. 

I would sign up to random subscriptions and hire freelancers without giving them clear instructions and wasted $1,000 on this process. 

Currently I am struggling to get my thoughts together for work. I am behind on my sales targets for the month and I just CANNOT get myself to start working. 

I have masturbated twice today to get my dopamine up, but my attention span is still terrible. 

I have lost 3kg of muscle over the last 2 months because my gym routine has been terrible. My cardio is ruined. I lost my $400 fitness tracker watch while being stoned outside. I lost my housekeys while being stoned. I had to spend $200 on a hotel room while being stoned and drunk out partying with my friends who are already successful and can afford it, pretending not to care about the money. 

I have been stoned and excited and ruined a huge chunk of my reputation with others, for being unreliable and unable to deliver on deadlines. This has ruined my own self-confidence too. I see myself as weak and inferior. I am fucking 23 now, but I was more responsible when I was 20. What the fuck. 

I set an ambitious goal for myself, to grow my business to $20,000 profit in 6 months, thank the simulation for giving me the higher power to quit, so that I can actually have a chance of achieving this goal. 

Now that I'm sober again, I've had the same realizations as last time - I must build a strong social network and speak with my family and close friends (even if its through video call) more often, otherwise I will inevitably sink back into the cycle of smoking weed to get enough dopamine. 

Oh well. I still have 6 months left to get it done. My attention span is shit, but steadily improving. As soon as I press ""post"", I will get back to work and start making cold calls again until I book a meeting (this should take about 1 hour). After that, I will complete my landing page and start running ads on $35/day budget. After that I will put on my mask and go straight to the gym and have a back workout. After the gym, go to the supermarket, buy some meat, go home, cook, microwave vegetables, eat and sleep.

I started smoking last year regularly. At first it was good. In my country most of the weed we get is brick weed. So one day I decided to buy a flower. Bought it, came home, it was a little bit brownish, not really green. It looked like it was old.  So, I smoked a lot in a little span of time, because I was used to brick weed (had to smoke more to get high). Well, I can tell you that this day was probably the worst day of my life, because I was so high I did something that I'm still dealing with today. The guilt was terrible. Nothing criminal, but nothing I'd EVER do if I wasn't high, not even really drunk. I didn't something to anyone, it was a behavior that only hurt myself psychologically. It's something I only feel comfortable talking openly with a professional of mental health, which I did and still do. That day I felt a lot of bad feelings, cried a lot... So, the aftermath is that I quit after smoking a few times after that terrible incident, because my mind raced a lot, went places I didn't want it to go... and with therapy and meds (I already suffered from anxiety, OCD and some depression) I feel way better today. I still think daily about that day, but understanding the context (not just the weed) of what was going on with me helped a lot. But it took months so I could feel some real relief. There was a day (probably second worst day of my life) that I mixed meds, weed, and alcohol, had a crisis, had suicidal thoughts and ended up in a psychiatry ward due to my psychologist advice. Luckily my parents were there to help me as well. I didn't have to stay there at least. 
So guys, my statement is. Weed is not for everybody and it changes you. Your perception of reality, your behavior, your way of thinking, it can make you do some really stupid things. I'm glad I quit weed and I'm doing much better. 
If you're struggling I hope this message helped you in some way, because I was really in a bad place and I managed to get help and I'm still alive and kicking. 

Thank you for reading.

My history with substances is like a bad love story.  I have had long stretches of sobriety (no weed, no alcohol, 12 Step programs, meditation, etc.), my longest stretch was 18 years, so this is not my first time at the rodeo.

However... I had a back injury during the pandemic that disabled me to the point where I couldn't stand or walk and I couldn't get to a doctor.  So at my lowest point, weed sidled up and whispered in my ear, ""Why don't you have a turn on the dance floor with me again?  Remember how much fun we used to have?""  I bought into the all new and improved hype about how medical marijuana cures all ills and I live in a city where weed is not only legal, but you can go on the web and order it to be delivered right to your door.  ""HEAVEN!"", the seventeen year old still inside me thought.

So the weed delivery people became my best friends during the pandemic.  My back felt better, I felt better, life was great... until... hey, it's a year later and now I'm smoking all day, every day.  I stopped talking to all my old human friends, ashamed of my new herbal best friends, Sativa, Indica and Mr. Hybrid.  I gave my new best friends all my money, attention and time.  In return they took all my self-confidence, devasted my savings, f'ed me and left laughing.

NO MORE!  I rode out the first couple weeks and dealt with the constant rolling hot flashes, night sweats, (yes, I'm an older woman posting on reddit - shocking!) agonizing anxiety and existential dread.  AND.  Here I am, on the other side, standing strong.

No matter where you are in your journey with this drug - and make no mistake, it is a drug - you can do this.  I don't care if you are 17 or 70, it can be done.  Hang in there.  I'm rooting for you!  And for US!",19,2

I have a hard time seeing my way out. I have Christian beliefs, and that's the only way I see out. But its all messed up in my head. Most Christians I have met don't even act as Christians do. They scare me. Because I don't want to be deceived. God and my family are the reasons I will never kill myself. They say ""find a church, go to church"" okay yes, I agree that would probably be very helpful (in my case) But what church? There's thousands of strains of Christianity, there most certainly not all right.   


In the past years, I've seen the person I've become. I've betrayed quite a few people, and screwed over even more? Hurt me? Cool, I'll just blindside you because I don't know how to handle being an adult, and I'll just make myself feel like even more of a piece of crap. I hate the person I am. I wouldn't like me if I were in a better place in life either.   


I've been trying to quit for like 6 years now. I just keep going back. If it's not one thing (weed), its another. How can I ever expect to get my life together if all I do is grasp to whatever instant gratification is near? Seems like all I've known for too long. I hate this dark place. Yet I go deeper, doing more damage and pushing myself further behind in life. My self-control is a distant and dull memory.   


I'm so broken. I'm in so much pain and I have no damn clue how to make this stick. I need to get sober and stay sober. This isn't what life is about. I wish I weren't so self-aware sometimes. Nobody knows when they're going to die. I sure hope to God that I have a long life ahead of me. I have maybe another life time ahead of me, if not 2 life times. But nobody knows.

She promised to drop me off at the garage to pick up my car that had been repaired. I took some time off from work so I could collect it, and waited for her all morning. After calling her 5 times I gave up because I knew she was still in a coma and wouldn’t pick up the phone. I knew she was smoking all night like she always does and her mom had to wake her up at noon to get her to work on time. So a few more carless days for me, living in the middle of nowhere. I walked 6 miles to get some food that day... Today I took some time off from work (AGAIN) to collect my car. Guess what happened? She overslept again! And I was soooo frustrated that I called a cab that cost me 100 euro’s to get there. I also was sooooo frustrated with her lack of responsibility.

I have money in my wallet right now and I haven’t touched it. I’m proud of myself for not spending it. My weed man moved to another city and it feels like divine intervention. I couldn’t stop impulsively messaging him and buying more. Now I can’t do that anymore. 

I just feel like I’m stuck in this cycle. I get high everyday for a while until I either run out of money or feel like my life is falling apart. Then I get sober. I usually average around a month. Then I start telling myself it’ll be different this time. You’ll be able to have self control this time. Then I buy more and the cycle continues. This last time I spent a whole month telling myself “just one more time”. It’s never one more time. 

I know this post is depressing but that’s how I feel right now. I just need somewhere to get this off my chest with people I know will understand. I hope it gets better.",8,0

I haven’t quit yet, but I cut down a lot in the past month or two. I don’t dab in the morning anymore. I was high for so long that it was weird as fuck the first day I didn’t wake up and dab. I’ve heard this called sober high, I was in a different state of mind than I was used to. It hit me that I needed to learn how to be sober again. I have. Now I dab 1-3 times a day, even 0 a couple times. I don’t know if I’ll quit. I like it. But in all honesty, sometimes I dab when I don’t want to. I decide that it will be a 0 day, but I end up dabbing anyways. I guess this is what has proved to myself that maybe I have an addiction, and these must be cravings. It’s not like I imagined. The cravings aren’t crazy. They’re just a simple desire, like wanting a milkshake. I need to prove to myself that I have willpower, so I’m going to really stop for a week.

I have a two year old child, wife and a good job. I've been able to make it through life numbing myself daily and most people don't notice much - but I do. Making it worse is that I live in a state where there are more weed stores than Starbucks. Literally 4 of them within a mile. It's so easy and accessible. 

The pandemic has escalated things... Stuck at home, no social life, no family to see - the best thing I can do is just numb myself to go through another day. Grab my pen, take a quick puff, go back to doing whatever. 

Now that we're getting a little social again, I think about my friends who hardly ever smoke (only when I talk them into it). They have lots of shit going and more importantly, they have ENERGY. I hate feeling that I've been turning myself into a zombie to help manage anxiety, at the cost of missing out on my child's first years. 

I hardly even feel it anymore after the first smoke of the day. So I'm thinking, why do I even need this? What *really* changes in my life minutes before smoking to minutes after smoking? NOTHING. Just me, in my own head. Yesterday I decided I don't need to smoke anymore.

675,2021-05-17 10:55:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/neieoa/changing_environment_temporarily_or_going_on/,changing environment temporarily or going on vacation is one of the easiest ways to quit or take a break.,"My theory is somewhat simple. we are habitual creatures, a lot of those habits are controlled by our triggers (Thanks, Charles Duhigg), and our triggers very often lie in our environment, so a change of environment would lessen our triggers & reduce the chance we succumb to habits. 

I would also like to mention that a change in environment is often good for the mind and spirit. Human nature is commonly driven to novelty... we like change, variety, etc. and while the age of social media and having no shortage of stimuli make this harder, it should not be overlooked. 

The change in environment & reduction of stimuli + heightened spiritual/mental state that comes with it makes it easy.

I have been smoking for years, and find it near impossible to quit at home. Even cleaning house.. the triggers are still there. It feels like an uphill battle, because you are constantly reminded of what you can't have. 

When I go on vacation, I find the 1st-2nd day to be a little hard, but it is easy to cover up in the experience of being in a new city/country, having options of so many things to do, etc.

Not to mention,  the change in environment makes it easier to see the change inside you because you are not stuck inside the patterns as much, but can take a more birds-eye view. 

It helps me realize stuff like how much clearer my head is, how much more fulfilling life is when you are mindful, not depending on a substance, or the feeling it gives. This, and other similar realizations, make me happy and gratified inside. As someone who has depended on substance to be happy for a long time, finding other sources of happiness deeply gratifies my soul and gives me the strength I need to not want to smoke and be high, even if I deep down know a puff of that mary will feel great. 

What is interesting is that, when I come back from a trip, I find myself not wanting to smoke, because of these realizations and my lifted spirit. It's hard to go back to that substance-dependent forced euphoria after experiencing a few sources of genuine happiness that don't come with the mental prison weed does. 

So, if you feel trapped, stuck, feel like you've tried everything to the point where you just gave up, and possibly keep using even though you know what it's doing to you, try doing a hard reset. change your environment. take a flight somewhere. go camping. maybe even just a day trip to the city or a more rural area, where you break your patterns and stimuli-driven actions and come back to your spirit. follow up and reflect on it, if you can. You will be surprised what it can do.",35,0

Overtime weed moved my emotional and mental health baseline down by a huge degree without me even really noticing. A great analogy is the frog in hot water situation. Lets say my pre-weed average baseline was 5 of 10. Normally I'd be a 5, when something exciting in life happened, I would reach a 10 and when not doing well at all maybe hit a low of 1. When weed was introduced it enabled me to exceed my former max level of 10. It felt amazing, but its not sustainable. My brain compensated for this by down regulating feel good chemicals to be more balanced with weed now in the mix. Not only was my max reduced but also my minimum was reduced as well, so now instead of having a possible low of 1 its now down in the negatives, worse than I would have felt pre-weed. After weed was a regular part of my life my average baseline was now a 3 and I'd need weed in my system in order to even reach a 5. Over time this situation grew worse and worse with my baseline moving down and down and me depending more and more on weed to feel comfortable and okay.

When I tried to stop many times in the past I hadn't considered nor was I prepared to go through the recovery needed to restore my old baselines. The reality of my situation is that once I stopped I wasn't going to be feeling very well for a long time. Without weed to artificially inflate my average baseline I was now sitting at what in pre-weed days would have been a very low baseline number.

I quit on June 14th 2020. Day by day, week by week and month by month things improved and biologically what was happening was my brain balancing itself again to a normal level, like in my pre-weed days. This was a slow process and there were many days along the way were it was not a fun process at all. It was intense enough at points during the first 6 months that it basically distracted me from living a normal life. This didn't last however and as time moved on and I pushed through and did everything I could to get through the bad days magic started happening. Things slowly improved. My baseline started to return to normal and sometimes I'd even reach a 10 again - without weed! For me this took about 5 or 6 months and even after almost a year I'm pretty sure there are still improvements happening.

In my past attempts to quit where I failed I was not prepared for, or willing to go through this period of recovery, nor was I educated on what it was going to be like. I thought I could just stop, give it a couple weeks and be good to go. When that never happened I'd always fall back into the cycle of using weed to feel well again, and after the two or more week break it was very rewarding, justifying continued use again. Being committed to putting in those first months was so important to successfully changing my life.",97,0

Throughout life we are all told how different each person is but when it comes to drugs there always seems to be a black and white view. Smoking causes this, drinking causes that etc. My experience smoking weed for 10 years and having 90% of my friends smoke it too is that we all experience it differently. It's easy to forget when you all enjoy it because the instant effects are so obvious!

Someone more scientific than I could argue the nature vs nurture idea and how that can explain it. Even more so though in quitting we will all experience it differently, I envy those who quit with a partner to support them. This isn't a sob story but I quit because I lost my gf and I wish I had that person to lean on. 

But to anyone reading posts who is very low or demotivated etc, please don't take everyone's experience as how it should be for you. This is day 45 for me, yesterday I was feeling worse than I had been for weeks. We are ALL different, we're different people in different circumstances. Definitely this sub can been a life saver but don't just read the top posts and think you should be where they are. Write your own posts and you'll see that there are those out there who will be in a similar situation. You are not alone, you're just different and that isn't a bad thing, that's what makes you, YOU. Love that fact, because you'll be so much stronger for it in the future and maybe you can help others who have had it as rough as you.

Guys/girls – honestly I wish I had the willpower or bothered to do it sooner, I genuinely feel like a different person. I have seen a lot of posts on here for people who are underwhelmed when they stop smoking, they don’t see a big difference in their daily life.

I think for me personally it was a mental block, I have wanted to stop smoking for a few years now, all my laziness I blamed on smoking, my lack of confidence I blamed on smoking, putting on weight I blamed on smoking. Being able to not want to smoke after every life activity has definitely changed me. 

I am much more responsive at work.
My eating habits have changed (No more late night munchies)
I wake up feeling a lot fresher and clear.
Many people have commented on my skin? And how I seem more fresh faced, I have noticed myself my eyes no longer have a glaze.

Anyway…compared to my post 2 weeks ago, I feel like a different man. I really feel like I can take on the world and win lol

 A turning point for me was yesterday, meeting with a friend who I randomly smoke with whenever she calls me. I still met her; I even rolled the joint for her. But I didn’t smoke, I told her my reasoning and she understood. At the same time, a few friends have asked me to come and smoke and when I say I have quit, they say “Again?? Come on, I have got some nice amnesia to make you forget about all that”. I made a deal with my friends after this, if they call me to smoke and they actually commit and come down, they would owe me £100. And if I ever call them to smoke, and I commit and go to meet them, I would owe them £100. Not to say this works, no money has been paid yet haha but I definitely haven’t received any calls since.

I hope to high heavens I can keep this up. Any time I have had the real urgency to smoke, I have run to the gym. Whatever the time. And it helps so much, it also tires me out which helps me to sleep.

I love you all – whether its day 1 or year 1 of sobriety, I can understand the difficulties of quitting. Some people definitely will struggle more than others. I believe once you get past the mental reliance of weed, you can leave it forever.

Good luck to you all, and truly, thank you for the support in this community.",17,0

I was smoking all day every day to the point I could no longer get high unless I took multiple dabs (I know it’s awful) but I decided to quit after getting food poisoning and fearing weed would make me feel worse. But soon realized that I actually enjoyed the feeling of sobriety after the major withdrawal symptoms subsided. However, it’s been over a month now and I still have awful digestive problems. I constantly feel a pain in my abdomen and whenever I eat I just feel terrible and can feel every step of the digestion process. I also have abnormal bowel movements(undefeated food) and nausea. I was wondering if anyone had similar experiences and if so any timeline I could expect my digestion to return to normal?

I've been in the sub for about a year, and I have tried to quit weed a ridiculous amount of times. I took three weeks off, knowing that I wanted to quit permanently and knowing that I would succumb to the cravings on my birthday. I just turned 20 last week, and that night, I smoked as if my life depended on getting that next hit. That then turned into a week of habitual and intense smoking. Today is my first day off since my return to smoking.

Now, I am going to list a few of the worst negatives that weed brings to the table. The worst side effect I have noticed is that my appetite completely disappears when I am sober. This has led to some awkward family dinners and breakfasts, which have deeply traumatized me. Next, I make music, and weed consistently turns off my brain's creative/motivational parts. When I am smoking, I am less prone to get any songs done, and I feel worse about myself for this. Next, my grades slip a lot when I am smoking, leading to some angry parents and disappointment in myself.

I honestly have ruined my younger years fighting an invisible battle with marijuana, so I am determined to quit now so the rest of my life does not go down that same path. Thank you for reading, and good luck with your own journey into the unknown.

First off, this sub is fantastic. I wish I knew about it back when I quit in the past, just reading through people's posts and how much they resonate with me is really good for combating the triggers and urges to smoke. Today is my day 1!

I've been smoking weed for 10+ years, since late 2009. I started off doing it on weekends and by mid 2010 it was pretty much 4-5 days a week. I was 18 at the time and reconnecting with high school friends which is what got me into it. I was fascinated by the substance, from how hilarious it made the most simple things to mercilessly destroying entire buckets of fried chicken in a single night. These were genuinely some of the best days of my life and I do not regret them. My friends weren't just stoner buddies, but guys I had grown up with at school since I was 11 years old. It was so fun! I do envy people who have those times and then stop soon after instead of getting fully addicted to it. 

I met some actual stoner buddies around 2012 and my use rate increased exponentially. I was now smoking pretty much everyday, around 5-7 grams every couple of days between 3-4 people. We only ever smoked joints mixed with tobacco. I gave up straight cigarettes in 2012 and only smoked joints. I'm so glad I realised how horrible cigarettes are before it was too late. 

My tolerance began to grow rapidly, I was noticing that I wasn't getting as high as before and was beginning to get some accompanying anxiety, a racing heart and feeling short of breath, but this didn't happen everytime. I was a dumb 21 year old who didn't realise my brain was trying to tell me this stuff is no good and now you're getting addicted to it... in retrospect I realise it was exactly that.

Got a decent job and moved back home full time in 2013 which just made my habit way more accessible. I began to withdraw a little and avoided social situations too. I still have issues with those because it got pretty bad, I've always been a bit of an introvert so it just made that side come out more. 

I managed to quit in 2015, relapsed once after 3 months then stopped again for another 4... then relapsed again and have been smoking ever since. It was a stoner buddy I haven't seen for 2-3 years now that got me back in. I regret it big time. 

I'm 30 this month and it's time to give this crap up once and for all. I've had enough of not being able to have fun without weed, shortness of breath 24/7, crappy inconsistent appetite and random spikes of nausea, but most of all it's my sleep. Even when I'm high I sleep terribly now. In the end it gave me no choice, and honestly I am glad. I couldn't do this shit at 40.

Had two years where I was only weekend use, a great time, felt I could be productive when high and actually got something out of it.

(Now 18 days weed free!)","After six years of smoking weed on a daily basis, i now haven't smoked for 18 days. And i'm quite proud of myself!

I have NEVER told anyone about my addiction and no one knew about it. It felt like i was living a double life for years, constantly making excuses, lying about what i was doing and feeling like a complete idiot. 

Now it all started when my friends and i discovered weed when we were about 19 y/o. We used to hang out in the evening and just get really high. At first it was amazing. We would laugh our asses off and watch silly movies or series and it was genuinely a good time. I didn't think it was much of a problem back then. 

But after a while it would become very normal, a bit too normal. Everytime we would hang out we got high. I was kind off socially awkward back then and the weed would make it much much worse. My friends didn't seem to be much different after we smoked a few joints but i would get really anxious anti-social and extremely self aware. 

That didnt change the fact that i liked being stoned, i just didn't like to be around people anymore because of the anxiety. So i found out i would rather high on my own. I would buy or roll a joint and smoke it before going to bed (i was living with my parents back then). I had this ingenious idea of smoking a normal cigarette after so my parents wouldn't smell it. Which actually worked really well because they never found out. It was ''great''. I'm a big fan of music and i would listen to it until i was too tired to stay awake. (or watch movies/youtube for hours on end)

Months went by, smoking every night, spending a shitload of money, but i didn't care. I didn't care about anything anymore. I was not doing anything for school, my social life, or making any progress in life. All i would do is make the day go by to get high in the evening and do absolutely nothing productive. 

2 years later i got my own small place to live, a new job and new people around me. It was a nice change, although now it was even more easy to get away with my addiction with no parents around. Also i live in the Netherlands which makes it very easy to get weed. You can literally buy it in a coffeeshop in 10 different places in the city where i live. 

There was no sign of stopping, even though my anxiety was getting worse, i still didn't do anything productive and i was feeling really despressed and burned out. Then last year covid quarantine hit. The amount of free time i had was ridiculous. It felt awful because i was giving myself alot of free time for years now. But of course i felt like i had no choice but to keep smoking because i had to kill the time and i thought i couldnt sleep without it.

During 2020 my anxiety reached a whole new level by getting panic attacks. I never really had this before so i  thought i was either having a heart attack of dying of the covid virus. After one of these attacks i threw away all my weed and sweared i would never smoke again. But you guessed it, the next day i lied to myself and bought some more. Thinking that i just had too much at once, and dosing it down a little would help. 

Couple more months went by. Getting a panic attack now and again and getting real tired of my shitty addiction. Thinking i was never going to quit and just be a failure in life, as i had no self discipline AT ALL. 

Some time ago i was laying stoned in my bed, and i just couldn't sleep. Negative thoughts clouded my mind going over all the bad choices i made in life and how i couldn't believe how it gotten this far. I was one on the most awful nights i had in my life and it all came down to how weed completely destroyed a good part of my young adult life. The next day i knew i was NEVER going to smoke weed again.

So now, 18 days later i finally feel free. I feel like i have control over myself, my thoughts and a genuine good look on life. I have absolutely no problem falling asleep or waking up. My dreams are just insane. Sometimes bad, sometimes good. It just feels great to dream again after such a long time. Everything i eat or drink tastes SO much better. My social skills have returned and i actually want to hang out with people again instead of making up excuses to get high. Granted i never smoked in the morning of midday, so i don't get cravings at all during those times of day. But now looking back to it, i don't understand why i needed to get stoned in the first place. 

&#x200B;

To anyone trying to quit or is quitting right now: Just don't stop believing in yourself! You WILL thank yourself after some time! Maybe after the first day of quitting, maybe 2 years later. It doesn't matter. The high of life is better in every way.

I've been trying to get over my weed addiction since about midway through March this year, and while I've had some really great stretches of sobriety, the most I've managed to build up is 3 weeks. 2 weeks ago my family was going through a lot of stress (I'm a 21 year old who lives at home unfortunately) and it caused me to relapse for about a week, during which time I barely left the house for anything. Today I'm at 1 week again and I feel better, but one of the biggest problems I've had this whole time is reintegrating myself into ""normal"" society. These past few weeks I've only gone out to see a friend once, and it felt really forced, almost like I wasn't supposed to be there at all. I feel like I still get those dirty looks people would direct at you just for having red eyes or smelling a little skunk. And this can be said for a lot of people so I feel bad complaining about this, but I literally don't remember the last time I've made a friend. I can't hang out with the stoners in my life because if they're smoking so will I, and I can't relate to the sober people because I've spent so much time in my own little world.

Maybe the one saving grace is my new job; terrible hours and pay, but the people there are genuinely really nice, and getting to show up and just be myself has felt really great. That being said, I'm only getting like 9 hours a week at this point, and it's been really hard figuring out what to do when I'm off the clock. I've got a few creative outlets, but locking myself in the house and just writing all day doesn't feel any more normal then locking myself in the house and smoking all day. I see tons of people out having amazing times with each other but I just don't know how to break back into that world. If any of y'all have felt similar, I'd appreciate any and all advice.

Just wanna get this out of my chest. I am 26 years old, male, and I have just decided to quit smoking for good. It took a whole lot of courage and a lot of time before I finally admitted to myself that my weed consumption is getting detrimental for my physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being. I've been an on-off stoner for around 8 years and been smoking heavier than usual in the past 3 years. I must say that I've had a love-hate relationship with cannabis. My first experience with weed started when I was 18. It was just an occasional thing for me until 3 years ago, I found myself *positively productive* while under the influence of weed. I would smoke everyday. At first, everything about weed just excites me; The idea of switching from one strain to another, depending on its effects, excited me. I found all things related to weed very interesting, I bought different kinds of pipes, bongs, and enjoyed THC in different forms. 

Overall, I loved how weed can instantaneously give me *peace and solace -* feelings which I never labeled ""*synthetic*"". I've always thought the feeling was organic and a gift from the Universe. *It's a plant after all,* or so I thought. I would smoke sativa before going to work and hit some indica before I doze off. Needless to say, I was self-medicating and I thought it was ok. I thought it was a cool way to get through the day every day until it took a toll on me. After months of smoking weed regularly, bud and/or vape, I noticed my behavior has been altered a little bit and my way of thinking has somehow changed. I would always weigh in the good and bad effects and would always find myself defending my weed consumption -- I would search for articles on *how smoking weed is never a bad thing* and how *it can elevate your awareness, consciousness, and spirituality.* Whenever I would come across posts that state otherwise, my mind will automatically deny that idea. 

For years, I convinced myself that weed is not a bad thing, *you just have to set your intentions right before using it.* But now, I realized how I was just lying to myself to conceal the main reason why I am smoking: to cover up the things that I need to deal with and to simply make everything and everyday *enjoyable* and *tolerable.* I never wanted to admit that I was dependent on weed, let alone label myself as an addict. And now it's clear so today, I am deciding to free myself from this detrimental loop. I am over it and I am ready to take my power back. Acceptance is the first step to healing and I am grateful to have this empowering community as I embark on this journey. No more fooling around with Mary Jane.

But i still dont know why i kept doing it the next day and the next day and the next .

Well long story short , weed killed my career by my choice .

I made many business decisions while being high and that resulted in a big lost in my career .

My journey 

1 - loving it 
Well i will be real here , i loved weed like nothing else i gave it my all , i had big dreams about it and wanted to do big things with it ; but in the end i was falling in love with the moment not with the process 

2 - leaving it 
It was obvious for me to leave it as i thought about venturing life and succeeding more in my career without it ( it was like i knew that i had to leave it ) and i did for the period where i be working hard grinding and sticking to the game .

3 - the come back
The come back , oh well after all that grind i have to rest and rest assured i got into weed heavily on every come back , like really heavier than the last comeback . 

4 - the fall of 
Weed began to make me stuck to this cycle of smoking then working hard then smoking ,
I was fed up with my self that i said “ you know what , i will work whilst being high “
And that was what took my career path to its lowest that it has ever been .

Im happy to say that im in day 2 sober right now 

What im feeling right now 
- strong cravings ( sudden ) not all the time 
- depressed thoughts ( really dark ones )
- anxious

I knew it made you lazy. I knew it fucks up your memory. And at the time I was productive as fuck (literally studying 7 hours a day at the age of 17 - which I know wasn't healthy either but probably down to an addictive personality) and I was proud of that fact - I knew I would never have let that down for the world.

But my cousin and brother had something I sorely lacked and that was friends. They had these regular set of friends they would see everyday to get high with, chill and just have a laugh. It made me see weed as this magical drug that helps people connect and get along - when in reality it forms behavioural patterns binding yourself to those ""smoking buddies"" so you could get that juicy hit of pure (unearned) dopamine.

Fast forward to university, this lapse in judgement meant that it was my go-to method to make friends - which was just heavily problematic because I filtered out every non-stoner and surrounded myself with a toxic group of skeletons who's only reason to connect and meet was to smoke bud. 
I fucking hated them but I ended up tolerating them for that fucking dopamine hit. That fucking dopamine hit man.

I ended up finding out that they would only invite me because I would pay for this one guys smoke (we had a tab going that I thought he would pay back - clearly I wasn't aware back then that you can never trust an addict) and he loved the free weed. I ended up paying for about £500 worth of weed for this guy - which in retrospective wasn't massive - but the combination of being taken advantage of so hard and essentially being robbed of a true university experience because I chose to hang around with the stoner rather than functioning fucking adults always got to me, and I feel has fucked with my ability to trust people again.

At this point, my-past self was virtually non-existent. My past-self aspired to pass through dental school with top marks. My past-self had confidence and he had real friends. My past-self was fucking hilarious man. My past-self had healthy relationships with his family. My past-self wasn't a narcastic skeptic about everything.

This creature that I've become wrecked havoc on that plan - I had to drop out university and used that, and the negativity surrounding everything, to justify a continued cycle of smoking everysingle day.

I want to become that past-self again but I fear he's dead and its always too far gone to recover, and that fear has always kept me from stopping until I read the following quote in this sub:
""There is nothing stronger than a broken man who has rebuilt himself""

I've now came to terms with the fact that I may never be as productive, accomplished, funny or loveable as I could have been without weed - like my past-self wanted. 
But atleast I won't be that creature for any longer.
It gave me the hope that there was a future-self out there that may be worth a try.",24,0

I love the smell, the taste, the activity of packing my bong and hitting it... i miss it. Every time I want to get lost in a bowl, or get baked and Xbox, I have to remind myself that I don’t like how I feel when I’m high anymore, or how I feel about myself when I gave in. I remind myself that I chose to stop. It’s hard, especially because everyone else in my home uses... but I realized that I am responsible for my sobriety. I choose not to partake anymore.",9,0

I am 28/f, have been smoking weed for the last 13 years. Started in high school and never stopped. As the years progressed I found myself smoking multiple times daily, alone, morning to night. Not only to cope, but to function. I smoked all the time for years and classic unhealthy weed consequences  followed. No motivation for self care, ate like shit, isolated, depressed, self loathing and all the while, hiding my pain from everyone. 

I was codependent on weed and hated it yet couldn’t stop. I worked a normal kindergarten teacher job and was “a high functioning stoner” yet felt empty inside. I was home 24/7 and up to smoking 7 GRAMS a day in joints when I finally had my awakening. 

Unfortunately it took me having trouble breathing to the point where I felt I was having a heart attack and had to be rushed to emergency. It was unbearable pain and all I could think was “why did I do this to myself”. 

I went to the ER and spent 10 hours/overnight only to find out the pain was the result of dense gas in my chest & a LOT of build up in my gut. This was all a result of my lifestyle over time. 

THIS CHANGED MY LIFE. 
Since this happened I haven’t smoked weed and I never thought I’d say that. I was the person who tried to quit and failed everytime. I debated AA and rehab and never went. I was in deeper than you can imagine and needed to have a health scare experience to quit. 

Some of us learn the hard way and I was one of those people. I’m so thankful to be ok and in control of how I treat my body. I couldn’t believe I let myself get here. I have never felt more motivated to take care of myself and am so emotional about finally recognizing the person I see again. 

To anyone struggling, it’s so much better when you’re in control. I’m here to talk, encourage or support you. Because I was you. 

When your ready to let go, nothing will feel more empowering. 

Was just happy to finally post here! :) Hope you all are having an amazing day. Thanks if you made it this far :)",64,0

I used to smoke here and there then went to college, slowly smoked more, then covid and like many became a daily user. It used to be enjoyable. I felt the world open up and I could do the many things I used to procrastinate cause I'd just do them high. Whether that be tedious tasks or things I enjoyed, but wouldn't have the energy to start. Smoking used to be that boost the got me going. Now it's the ball and chain the stops me from moving. Sometimes I'd smoke and just get too lazy. Other times immobile from the thoughts and anxieties. The worst part was I was losing my passion for music, which was part of why I smoked in the first place. Tp listen to and play music, but then it became I could do either unless I was high. So I decided it was time to quit. I dont want to replace my passion for music with an addiction to weed.

I am confident in this decision, but I had to move home little less then a year ago, which is full of triggers. Both of my parents are consumed by weed. My mother hasn't been at her job in over a month and sits at home high all day. The first thing my dad does after work is hit his dab pen and start drinking. They both complain about never having energy or motivation. I try to tell them that it's the weed that is draining them, but neither want to listen or if they do forget by the next day. My brother is 18 now and has started smoking daily and won't listen to my warnings cause is cool if he does cause he's the kid with stoner parents.

I used to smoke to escape the feeling that my family is burning their lives away and never getting any genuine experiences, but realized I was doing the same thing. I get really mad at them sometimes since I quit vaping 2 months ago and then feel guilty cause they really don't understand what they're doing.

What ultimately made me stop was getting dental work done. Had a tooth pulled that was a failed root canal and my dentist told me not to smoke for 8wks because of the implant I was getting in my jaw bone. Before that time, the longest break over 1wk I took was 60 days off in spring 2019.

Dealt with night sweats, bad sleep and the occasional cravings but I never felt addicted. I’m now in a better place in life as well. New job in accounting, back in the dating scene talking to an absolutely gorgeous gal thats out of my league, money saved and invested, more financial freedom in general, no more brain fog, memory is so much more clear, back to being way more social, dealing with depression/anxiety the right way and not just bandaging it with weed, working out and staying in great shape.

I’ll take all those positives over a lil high that gave me temporary happiness. I’m finally finding true happiness in just being myself.

Apologies for using a brand new account... I don’t know if that is allowed or not, but I did not want to use my main account since my friends know my username. 

Anyway as the title states, today would be day zero with no cannabis. I was discharged from the hospital yesterday due to a mental breakdown. I have a LOT of stressors going on in my life that I am having trouble managing, including a mood disorder (Bipolar). I do go to therapy and take medication for my Bipolar disorder.

I’ve been a daily weed smoker for the past 13 years and while cannabis used to be really helpful in aiding my ability to sleep, eat, and manage anxiety, now it only does the opposite. I really want to get my mental illness under control, and this includes removing cannabis from my life. Embarrassing as it is, I’m pretty sure that I’m addicted to cannabis since I rely on it heavily for sleep. For the past few months I regret smoking every time I do because my anxiety just goes through the roof... but I do it anyway. Rinse and repeat. Last night I made the conscious decision that I am DONE torturing myself with negative cannabis side effects.

I have been floating the idea of weed cessation for a few weeks now and consistently receive pushback from friends and even family members who smoke weed. They don’t believe that cannabis can be harmful or addictive to anyone in any way, and state that me quitting will “only make things worse”. Not gonna lie I am a little nervous about cannabis withdrawal and how it will effect my currently extra-fragile mental state. 

What is withdrawal really like? How can I manage this? How can I keep my willpower strong, even on extra shitty days that might be a trigger to start again?

I need to quit.,"TLDR : Girlfriend just left me cuz of weed addiction, I want to quit. Should I go cold turkey or give myself sometime to ease off while I grief? Feels like number my feelings right now isn't such a bad idea...  


This lockdown year has been incredibly hard for me as my company went bankrupt and I lost my other freelancing job due to covid.

To cope with the bad times, I started smoking a lot (I've been an everyday user for around 10 years, but I really kicked things up a notch this year). This entire year, I barely did anything. I was in a constant state of fogginess.

My GF is a driven and ambitious girl, she grew a lot professionally during that time while I stayed stagnant. She told me she couldn't handle my negative energy anymore, she felt weighed down instead of pulled up. She felt like she could never really read my sentiment and know how I felt and felt like I wasn't really there even when I was. She also told me her past 2 boyfriends were potheads and it felt like she was just repeating the same pattern again and again and needed to get out of the loop. She's been in relationships pretty much non stop since 10 years and felt like she needs to be alone for a bit...

All those symptoms she described to me feel like the exact thing weed does, it numbs you in a state of limbo where nothing really matters and where no emotions exist. I had been blind to my addiction and to how much it affected my partner, probably thanks the positive weed culture propaganda.

This is the biggest slap in the face I could have ever had. We had one discussion about it a couple days ago and she explained everything. So yesterday we met up in a bar to talk things out. I told her I believe my weed addiction is responsible for pretty much everything she was telling me. I told her I wasn't this useless stoner that she saw for the past year, that I was ready to give it all up for me, and for her...

But it wasn't enough. It's too late for her, she's hurting too much and she needs space from me... So even if it hurts, that's what I'm gonna try to do give her space. But more than anything... I need to quit weed. I need to get out of this negative loop and gain my love for life back.

I've usually been smoking 5 or 6 or joins per day, since our first conversation 3 days ago I've been trying to quit. I haven't been able to cold turkey yet, I've had about 1/2 half joints in 3 days so there is progress, but I still relapsed a couple times. And right now I'm so low that I really feel like a bit of weed would help numb the pain and go through these couple days... Just for a bit to help with the transition... But probably it's just the weed trying to trick me intro getting back in the haze...

What do you guys think? Should I go cold turkey and stay strong, or should I allow myself a transition period while I go through my loss?",10,2

I wanted to see what being stoned would be like after a month of sobriety (before my sobriety I was a daily smoker for 3 years). I knew this would be a bad idea and I shouldn't do it, but If I was 100% in control of myself all the time I'd never have had a weed problem that was so hard to kick in the first place. 

I took only 1 hit of one of the joints and got so stoned I almost freaked out. Heart was pounding, I was sweating, I had to just sit down and watch a whole podcast from start to finish so I could calm down. Eventually I did calm down and took 3 more hits spaced out throughout the day from the joints. I ate a disgusting amount of food, pretty much all the junk food I had around my house and then some. I  blew off all the plans and errands I set for myself that day, didn't go to the gym like I had originally planned, and instead spent pretty much my whole day trying to figure out which video game I wanted to play. I put like, an hour into several, accomplishing nothing substantial within the games. Really I did nothing productive at all that day with my time. 

I honestly don't remember the end of the night, I must have fell asleep on the couch then crawled into bed. No dreams. Woke up the next day with IBS from all the junk food, groggy as hell, dreading going to work. I felt like I was hungover. Despite having only taken a couple hits from each mini joint I immediately threw them away in the morning.

This relapse only reinforced my drive to stay clean, it reminded me of the reasons why I quit in the first place. I'm a couple days sober again, and already feeling much better. Being stoned is such a dirty, strange feeling.. When spending time away from it and dipping back in, I know that I couldn't do this as a daily thing again. I've learned that I prefer my sober state of mind much more than my stoned one. I thought I'd beat myself up and feel awful about this relapse, but instead I'm glad it happened. It was just another step away from my stoner self, I don't want to go back.",107,0

First of all I’d like to thank everyone for sharing their stories. I know talking about addictions isn’t always easy, but reading about your experiences does seem to help me. I would like to share my story, hoping to find people who know about the side effects I am currently dealing with.

I started smoking weed some five years ago. After a year or two, it started becoming daily. Then COVID happened, and I found myself smoking throughout the day because I was working from home. Every day exactly two grams.

Then, two weeks ago, I suddenly had a terrible experience. I was feeling very weak, almost like I was going to faint and I also felt extremely nauseous. Normally when I feel nauseous (which happens very often), smoking weed takes my mind off of it and helps me feel hungry. Because of this, I thought the feeling would go away by simply smoking some weed.

The opposite was true. The day after, on Monday, I felt absolutely terrible. My heart was rushing, nothing could calm me down and I felt like I wasn’t myself anymore. There was definitely some severe anxiety too, because I did not understand what was happening to me. The nausea also continued and I had difficulties falling asleep. I figured it was perhaps just a bad trip from the weed, and I decided not to smoke for a couple of days. My symptoms only barely improved, so I decided to call my GP on Wednesday. Feeling very ashamed, I did not tell him about my weed addiction.

Having explained my symptoms, the doctor thought it was probably a stomach virus, and that it would go away in a couple of days. Since I’m already very skinny and was not eating well because of the nausea, the doctor gave me a drug to numb the nausea. This worked really well, to the extend where Wednesday evening I decided to smoke up again. Although just one joint (compared to the 6/8 I was used to).

However, the great feeling I used to get when smoking did not return. I decided again not to smoke on Thursday and Friday. Then Saturday came, and I felt fine enough to light up again. Again, after just one joint I felt the anxiety and thumping heart returning. This was the final straw for me, and I decided to quit smoking weed altogether. I threw away my remaining weed, and I was feeling quite proud of myself for a day or two.

So the last time I had a joint is now exactly 7 days ago. Trying to counter the boredom, I started running once every two days, and this does give me some comfort. However, there are two symptoms I am currently experiencing which do cause me a lot of worry, and consequently sometimes makes the anxiety return: I constantly feel quite hazy, probably what others describe as brain fog, and it seems like I am suffering from Visual Snow. The rest of the symptoms have mostly passed, and only come back in waves. It does still take a long time to fall asleep.

Strangely enough, the craving for weed seems gone. I think this is because of the fear of feeling even worse is bigger. I guess that’s a benefit, and I hope the craving will stay away as time goes by.

However, the brain fog and visual snow does worry me a lot. I’ve read about HPPD (which could explain the visual snow) and depersonalization (which could be the brain fog), and this makes me worry even more. It’s been a week since touching weed, and these symptoms have not improved at all.

I am hoping to talk to people who have had these two issues, and I’m eager to learn whether they’re indeed symptoms of weed withdrawal, and how long I could expect these to last. The visual snow makes it difficult to look at my computer screen, which is becoming an issue with my work.

I stopped when I simply had enough of the bullshit. A professor of mine in grad school basically told me that I wasn’t ready to get into a Ph.D program. That hit me hard. I knew it was because I smoked all day and drank all night. I have one more year to prove myself, so I had to quit. 

I finished my first semester completely clean. I can’t even tell you how different, how good it feels. My mind is sharper, I have the will and drive to actually WORK and study. Unlike other semesters I actually tried and didn’t think it was going to be given to me. I read more than than was assigned—like complete books instead of chapters. I turned in an excellent paper ON TIME, I crushed an oral examination without long pauses from being high. My professor complimented my hard work. I came home and cried in gratitude. 

I don’t have to worry about how I smell. I had this whole strategy of showering and dressing AFTER I got high so I wouldn’t smell like weed. 

My family and friends see a difference in my life and mood. I’m not depressed anymore. I’m actually present in my relationships and show up for other people. I’m joyous, I laugh and joke a lot. It’s strange because this is ME and not some drug or intoxicant covering me over.

I have been reading this subreddit for about 2 weeks and Allen Carr’s book on quitting smoking cigarettes for about the same time. I had a busy day away from my stash yesterday. Although the thought of stopping was seeping in and out of my thoughts for years. Perhaps I could call it grace. When I returned home, I decided not to go to my desk to roll one. Instead, I came here and read your stories of fighting the good fight for yourselves. Fortunately, I am married to a nonsmoker so we decided to spend the evening out. When we returned home I once again avoided my desk. For some reason I did not have my usual urge to end my day with a joint. Very unusual for me and maybe again a bit of grace. 
I had a night of fitful dreams and awakening a lot. I can feel my whole brain in a strange way. Like it is waiting for the THC. . . But no urge to smoke. My thought now is if I am going to quit I should get rid of all my stuff. Here I sit twisted up over making that move, as I have done a # of times in my 51 year relationship with pot. Today, I will pack it all up to give away. I am not going to make a big deal out of quitting. Just going to say for some reason it has started making me anxious and that is not enjoyable.
Thank you all for your honesty and humor it has helped immensely. Now for day 2. Wish me continued grace.

He still won´t admit that weed was harmful to him, but it´s obvious he´s doing so much better without it. He just bought an apartment with his girlfriend. Because they could save money. Because they don´t spend all their money on FUCKING WEED.

Life is all kind of things. Sometimes very hard, sometimes very easy. But the huge ups and downs have been dampened greatly by my sober lifestyle and 99% of the time my mood is at ""normal"". I don´t want to feel ecstatic nor depressed.

I like adversity now. It builds me up and grows me as a man. I used to hate any hard work or roadblocks that needed overcoming. Now I feed off of attaining my goals.

Update: I can’t believe I’ve made it a whole year sober. The first few weeks were tough, and I still fight temptation, but that has mostly gone away. I have dealt with the majority of my mental illnesses, and I’m not afraid to deal with them head on when they flare up. I am happier, my relationships are better, and I’m doing things I would have avoided while stoned. It’s still far too soon to see if I can use in moderation, I’m guessing I’ll never be able to, and that’s fine by me. The most important thing I’ve realized is that I know who I am now, and I love who I am more. No constant anxiety over if I smell or look high. No more wondering if I’m being judged, and no more beating myself up over being an addict. Here’s to another year.
—————————————

Tonight’s the night. I believe in myself more this time. This is my pledge.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I(M35) am finally going to quit. It’s been a long time coming and reading the different posts over a number of years has motivated me to try again. I have quit before for a few months here and there, but always viewed it as something I want to go back to, you know, moderation.

I started smoking pot when I was in high school, here and there, and I enjoyed it. I wouldn’t turn it down if I was offered some. Pot became my drug of choice, but I would drink too. I don’t drink heavy now, might have a drink a week or 2.

I have 2 degrees and have a good job. I’ve been with the same wonderful women since 2004, I was barley 19, she was 17. We have 2 kids and we’re very happy. I’m not happy with my choice to smoke pot, and it’s something that causes tension in our relationship. I’m also concerned with my memory and that I’m completely missing out on life.

I have anxiety and depression, both diagnosed by doctors. I’m not on any medication, and I haven’t talked to my councillor in 8 months or so. I’m feeling really good about myself right now but I don’t have any other coping strategies other than using. When I pressured my wife a bit into getting a medical card, thinking I was capable of self medicating, she agreed. We’ve argued about it, but we love each other very much and have a strong relationship. She supports me. I always feel like I’m not meeting her expectations, but that’s probably my anxiety. I am told I am a good husband and a good father and I believe it and am proud of myself.

I’ve been telling myself for years to learn something or be creative, or get a hobby, to deal with cravings and to distract myself. When I do things, I want to be high. I’ve been getting high nearly every day for the better part of 4 years, and enough is enough. I’m really ready this time.

My commute to work is about 1 hour both ways, so I’m gone the majority of the day. Being home because of Covid has really put things into perspective for me and I’m throwing out everything after I post this. I’m making a promise to myself, no grand gesture, and I will be proud of everyday I continue to see what’s important to me. I will hold myself accountable by being honest and vulnerable. I will fight through cravings knowing I have support and that my life will be better. You’ve got this!

I have been a smoker since I started college, same as most in this Reddit. I used to only smoke once a week, a weed Wednesday kind of thing. However, throughout my four years of college, I have ramped up my smoking quite a bit. These past two years I have smoked with every meal and throughout the day and night. As graduation was fast approaching my anxiety has started to increase quite a bit which has lead to far more smoking. 

This has lead me to start to slip in my classes and has made me stall in my current state with very little motivation to change. This with the constant reflection of my life before weed and how much happier I was and more motivated I was. This lead to me consistently filling my head with negative speak about how dumb I am for smoking which has been hard on my mental state.  

This all kind of came to a boiling point this Tuesday when I decided to stop smoking weed. I decided to go out with friends that night to get my mind off smoking. Just to get the ball rolling. I ended up getting way too drunk and fell off a fence and slammed my head into a clay pot. After multiple stitches and a minorly broken nose, I have been sober for the past four days. This has lead to tonight where I am really craving to smoke and blow things off. This is the worst part even injured and hurt I still want to smoke and I don't feel like I can give it up.

I havent posted on here for quite a while. 

I didn't stick to my attempt at quitting like I had mentioned in a previous post, but since then I have made enormous changes in my life and want to mark today as the day I am deciding that enough is enough. 

I quit my incredibly stressful job that was driving me to hit the vape cart like it owed me money, and got a job in the same field for the same pay but without any stress. It's not my dream job I'm still working towards, but it's definitely a great change of scenery from what I was used to. The desire to smoke is not nearly as intense as it was at my last job. I was still getting high but not as regularly but each time I got high I'd realize I'm only hindering my growth professionally. The feelings of guilt would outweigh the fun feeling of a good buzz. 

What was the last straw for me? Well yesterday afternoon I hit the vape cart on my day off and the same usual feelings of ""what the fuck are you doing?"" came on again. I decided to challenge myself to not smoke for the rest of the night and reaffirmed that I am stronger than the cravings for weed and that any crazy thought or feeling is just the weed leaving my system. I was able to do it and felt proud when I went to bed tired and fell asleep. Woke up feeling stressed and not ready for the day however, and decided to go to the store and get some food. Normally before going to the store, I'd stop by the dispensary by my house. I thought to myself that I'll just get myself my last 3 grams of oil and carts and that will be it. I'm not sure how it happened or what came over me suddenly, but while I was pulling into the dispensary parking lot, that little voice in my head told me ""naw, fuck that. This starts now. If you go in there, you'll only feel like shit again."". Without a second thought I turned around and went to the store feeling incredibly proud of myself. This is a temptation I've had so much trouble with in the past but this time it wasn't a forced decision. I legitimately did not want to go in and hours later I'm still proud of that choice. Every little step, every day. 

Sorry, I know this is a rant but I wanted to post this because I'm feeling incredibly motivated to quit and know this time I got this.",12,0

I've had a very hard hit on my mood for understandable reasons within the last couple of weeks. As my mood went downhill my anxiety and suicidal thoughts came back full force, and so did the cravings to go back to weed.

Today I was very depressed and decided to make ""just a small order"" which was for a gram of concentrate at my local dispensary. I wasn't sure how to feel about this since it's been so long since I've smoked anything. I thought ""one cheat day won't ruin my hard work.""

I made the order, drove down there, and about 5 mins before I got to the dispo I realized I really didn't want to smoke and break my hard work of getting sober. I just wanted to feel better, to feel something aside from how I'm feeling. After a lot of hard thinking and back and forth in my head, I settled on deciding to ditch picking up my weed order, and instead, I went and got a burger, and then called my therapist. I still feel like shit but at least I still have my sobriety. Today marks 9 weeks exactly since I quit. This is the longest I've been able to stay sober since I started smoking weed back in 2016. I don't feel much better than before I made the order, but I know if I had relapsed I would be back at square one and feel even worse than I do now.

This might sound quite strange to a lot of you, but I’m wondering if there is any connection between body hair and weed. I’ve been heavily smoking for over two years, with the last year or so trying to quit for good a few times. This time however, I have real reasons and goals that are leading me to quit for good. 

Today I got a haircut, nothing abnormal, but I was looking at myself in the mirror and noticed dark brown, pretty long hairs on my chin and on the side burn areas of my cheeks. I’m 19 years old, turning 20 in less than a month and never in my life have I ever shaved, or had facial hair. My question is, is there a link between weed and that type of growth? Has the weed been delaying that type of thing or am I just really late? Again, I know this might seem a bit strange but I’m curious!

I've been reading some books about addiction and in one book, the author mentioned something called EFT. She was struggling with her problematic relationship with alcohol and did this therapy. It consists of gently tapping your body on meridian points, similar to those used during acupuncture / acupressure massage. 

I'd never heard of EFT before and the description in the book sounded a bit.... wacky. But I was curious, so I searched it out on YouTube and found a couple of videos.

Not gonna lie - it was hand down, the weirdest thing I'd seen to deal with anxiety, depression and  'all the feels'.  But I wanted to keep an open mind, and the price of entry to check it out was literally zero - like, 11 mins of my time. So I tried one of the videos (I chose the one with the 2.1M views by Mercola) and played along. I did a session and........

I'll be damned. It helped. Yes it did.

I'm pretty well versed in lots of coping skills like CBT, therapy, Acknowledge / Assess / Assist etc. But I'd \*never\* seen or heard anything like EFT before.

Also, I guess I had a lot to get out and this turned into more of a novel than I expected it to - apologies. 

Like many of you, I think I’ve finally gotten truthful with myself about how weed has been running my life. I’m a high-functioning stoner in a lot of ways - have an excellent career and most would probably call me an overachiever - but the reality is that I’m about to turn 41, and I’ve been smoking daily (basically constantly whenever I’m home) since I was I was about 19. The only times I’ve been sober outside of a work day are when I’m traveling or visiting my family. That is incredibly depressing to think about, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t jealous of those of you who made this decision much earlier than me. How much life I’ve missed!  

Needless to say it’s gotten particularly out of control in the last year of WFH and being inside so much, as I live alone and pretty much smoke all day every day. I’ve convinced myself that my depression and anxiety are better, I’m more creative, I’m a cooler and wittier person, etc. 

But I’m tired of the headaches and nausea, and the constant guilt, and the shitty lung capacity, and the utter laziness. My apartment is constantly a total mess. I barely get of bed when I don’t have to, and have developed a really expensive junk food delivery habit despite a fridge full of options. My attention span is a joke. 

I have a clear vision of what I want my life to be, which involves regular gym-going, cooking a lot more, prioritizing dating (I’m probably most ashamed of weed holding me back from this part of my life for so long) and even just going out more with friends instead of making up some excuse to go home and get high and mindlessly watch TV. And small potatoes in the scheme of things, but I’m beyond intrigued by lucid dreaming and can’t even attempt it because I’m high every night and don’t dream.

We’re starting to re-enter the world, and I’m coincidentally about to move into a beautiful new apartment, and I think it’s a perfect opportunity to reinvent myself, starting with kicking this addiction. Which... is what it is, clearly, and I need to really hear myself say that word.

So I know it’s the right thing to do, and I’m feeling ready and motivated, but I’m scared about how I’m going to function when I first stop. I work a high-pressure job on the creative side of TV advertising - it’s not saving lives or anything, but there are literally millions of dollars on the line and screwing up isn’t an option. A typical day requires leading meetings and brainstorms, a lot of multitasking, and basically being on top of my game from like 9am-9pm every day. So what happens when I suddenly can’t be creative on the spot, which is a regular need in my job? Or if I snap at someone under a tight deadline when I don’t have my insta-calm drug? I’m so proud of the career I’ve built, and I just can’t jeopardize it. My coworkers and clients don’t know I’m a smoker (let alone an addict) and would probably be surprised - I present as very Ann Taylor in my work life. How have you all dealt with the moodiness and anxiety and other side effects and still kept up your life? I plan to drink a lot of water, eat nutritious foods, and sleep as regularly as I can, but would love any tips for dealing with withdrawal after being such a heavy smoker for so long. Particularly in dealing with stress/moodiness.

And THANK YOU. I stumbled onto this sub and it’s exactly what I needed at exactly the right time.

I hope my victory today can inspire some of you and keep you motivated to stay sober and get back to living the life you truly deserve!

For a little background, I had smoked daily for 3 years straight before I finally had to quit due to massive anxiety attacks. My tipping point was being so anxious I couldn't bring myself to drive 2 blocks down the road to the grocery store.

During those three years, a particular low point for me was cheating a drug test to get my first real job after college. I thought there was no way I could quit long enough to get clean and sure enough time ran out on me and drastic times called for drastic measures. It was one of the scariest things I've ever done, but I somehow managed to pull it off. I passed my background check and started my dream job right out of college; still a full blown stoner.

As COVID hit I transitioned to working from home and found myself getting bored in the afternoons. I shamefully started smoking during my lunch break to ""stay focussed and engaged"" when really looking back I was more focussed on my addiction than my actual work. I felt my job performance slipping and it showed in my performance reviews and constant corrections from my boss.

Stopping all of the stupid work mistakes became a main goal of mine once I did eventually quit. Over time I felt my brain fog lift and I found myself handling complicated work issues with more and more ease. 

All of this came to a head today for my latest performance review. My boss told me that most people would be disappointed with their compensation changes this year, however I'm the exception...

I GOT A 25% RAISE!!!! 

She even told me how she saw MAJOR improvement in my work performance over the last 5 months or so. I'm at 4 months 22 days clean right now. Coincidence? I think not. This validates my work goal and shows that even when you sink to the lowest lows in your addiction you really can fight your way out and achieve everything you want to. I KNOW I wouldn't have gotten this raise if I didn't go down the path of sobriety. 

To all those struggling out there, stay strong. I've been there and if I can do it you most definitely can too. Cheers to another sober day everyone! ✌️",16,1

I put 'if they really want to' because ultimately its just you, taking action, and its your life. I used these simple things to quit cigarettes, which felt like one of the most impossible things to quit in ever. My motivation are as follows:

1) Everyone is experiencing pretty much the same long term effect symptoms we all are describing as side effects of weed. Why? Something isn't right there in the fact that a lot of us are hooked after long term usage.

2) know how long the chemicals will leave your body. One that phase is over, the rest is all habitual. 

3) Be pissed off that this thing has control over you. Im not a slave. This is my life. 

4) When you want to smoke, say maybe later. When later you want to smoke, say later again. 

5) When you really want to smoke because quitting makes your pissed off at everything, instead of fighting yourself and others, go outside and do something like running, mountain biking. Something that will make you tired and make your heart start really pumping.

Day 1 of not waking and baking was really bad. Im on day 2 now and I don't even want to smoke anymore. I rode my motorcycle around today and was next to a car that reeked of weed 😆 and I just laughed and felt bad for the guy because that used to be me. My mind cleared up. I had an actual dream last night where I saw my parents upstairs in my house come down like they were there to support me. I woke up, refreshed!, not burned out and wanting to smoke like for the past 20 yrs daily.

TLDR: Trick your mind to be so pissed off that you are like all the ppl in here going through the same bullshit. When u get the urge, go do something to keep your mind off it. Eat right, drink lots of water. I stopped drinking coffee too. Then, watch your life come back together because when you were baked, that wasn't really the real you.

This means that after 4 years of repeating this cycle every single day that I can no longer sleep without smoking, my mind races with thoughts and emotions and I lie awake for hours before I finally give in and end up smoking after my shitty attempt at taking a single nights break from this stuff.
It’s beginning to really bother me, I hate that I can’t go just one night without it but I find it so difficult. Does anyone have any advice for those first few nights of troubled sleep? I’d prefer not to substitute my cannabis for another type of drug to help sleep as I don’t want to become dependant on another substance, but I would be open to suggestion!
Any advice would be really appreciated, I feel like I need to do this in order to live my life to the fullest",5,0

I got diagnosed with BPD and a comorbid anxiety/panic disorder not too long ago as well. I kept having thoughts to myself that I wanted to stop, and that I smoke too much, but I was holding on to that feeling of just being level and complete. Until I had a massive nervous breakdown (about a week and a half ago) and weed just made it worse. Intensified my panic attacks and made my feelings of hopelessness and trapped worse. I’ve been on a leave of absence from work, and luckily my college semester just ended so I’m trying to pull myself together, and I haven’t smoked any weed in over a week. Downside is I got put on psychiatric medication as needed, but since it makes me feel like a zombie, I really use it for when I need it. It’s been really rough trying to pull myself together, but seeing this group and all the support out there makes me feel like there’s hope and I made a good decision to stop.

I just wanted to explain to you how I was finally able to do this thing without having all these intense cravings or wanting nothing to do but get back to my old smoking habits. As of now, I can finally say that I’m happier sober; relearning my own personality deeper and deeper than ever before.

Just to let you know, I’ve been a daily stoner since Christmas of 2017, a proud one at that, so it would make four years this Christmas (I remember saying happy two years high like it was yesterday). Let me just say, it was the sadness I felt for my family and for my mother who did not even recognize her first son any more that brought me out of this spiraling addiction (I know what the title says, let me finish). This pot thing grew into something far more than the innocence of what it’s portrayed to be. Since this is “leaves” I won’t go too far into it but this was in fact a gateway drug for me and I was always the person who SWORE I would never get into it. And then I SWORE that even if I did there’s NO WAY it was a gateway drug. Man was I wrong. I had a knowledge that my mother was disappointed and my family missed me. Most of the time I ignored it but as I’ve grown over the years it finally really hit me that I could easily spend the rest of my life the way I have been. And I finally remembered that I would do anything to make my mother happy. But what was more personally important to me was the realization that I wanted to remember the time I have left to live here at my home with my parents and brothers before I move out forever. Then I’ll have the choice to do so, but right now, remembering my childhood has become so important to me. 

I’ve done some rehab here and tolerance breaks there (all painful as hell) but this time I finally decided that I was going to do it for me. ME. No one else. For me and MY memories. And this freed me up from the guilt I felt and pressure from my family being against weed and the deep seated disappointment she felt that I was no longer really “there” anymore. I wasn’t just getting high, I was hiding from everyone and faking any level of care for anything of their matters. But I decided I wanted to remember my last days at home before I move out forever and so me and MJ have said our goodbyes, if it’s temporary then it’s temporary but if not then even better. I can’t be one of those who swears to never touch it again and count all the days because that will inevitably lead me to wanting it as badly as ever before.

To sum up, my family has influenced me to quit before, but until you decide that it’s a decision that you are making FOR YOURSELF, you will only be found down a road of guilt and shame. 

If you were the only reader who got this far, then I really hope it meant that much to you and you can use this in your fight :) I love you !!! You can do this!!!",7,0

------
Mental health improvement, scheduled surgery, I want to remember my son's milestones and growth, I want to know my emotions and feelings are genuinely my own, I want to feel proud when I look someone in their eyes, to put forth my best self, to not poop out on my husband because I'm tired or lifeless most of the time, to be present and aware when needed or wanted, to maintain coherent thoughts and goals from day to day, choose a life that isn't in my mind shameful. 

To find a job that matches my soul and skills, surround myself around people who take control when able and have faith when things are out of their hands.

I became a daily smoker (every night) at about 16/17 but before it was every weekend. Used to smoke bongs, pipes, and tobacco spliffs (very heavy on spliffs when i moved to Barcelona for 7 months). I moved back to Ireland in March 2020 and decided to ditch the tobacco joints and managed to give them up absolutely fine as i never really enjoyed tobacco just  used it to economise. The first 7 months back in Ireland i smoked like mad, bongs, huge pure joints, lots of hash and dabs/vape carts.  It was costing me an insane amount of money, thousands of pounds which I didn't really have to spend/could have spent in much better ways/saved. I tried to stop in September and i made it for a couple of days max. Then i told myself it would be okay to moderate using a volcano/handheld vape/ dab carts.

This quickly got out of hand, particularly with the dab carts as they were just too easy. The main reason i was giving up then was to try and better my relationship with my girlfriend who doesn't smoke and was always tired of my addiction. This didn't work at all and i soon got on to eating very strong edibles and smoking huge joints which absolutely fucked my chest, coughing all the time. 

My tolerance sky rocketed to the point i was doing back to back dabs while eating 250mg+ edibles yet still managing to interact relatively well with people, going to work etc and doing my university course. (In hindsight it had a huge impact on my academics and i could have done so much better during my 4 years had I not been getting high and putting off work/reading all the time). I was hiding how much I was spending and how much i was using which led me to feel guilty a lot of the time, especially as i was on the verge of being completely pennyless multiple times, just so that I could be high all the time.

The longest I went in all this time was a 10 day trip to Morocco where i was too afraid to score, but i had such terrible withdrawal symptoms looking back. I'm now 17 days into sobriety (excluding one small joint i smoked when i was drunk, but luckily didn't just say fuckit i may aswell start again).

I never thought this would be possible as my whole family smoke and my friends/colleagues too. What was instrumental in stopping for me was the fact that I was doing it for me and myself only this time. This has consequently improved my relationship with my girlfriend but it is very clear in my head that this journey is personal, which has allowed me in times when I consider relapsing that it would only serve to worsen my self esteem and increase my guilt. 

My ultimate goal is to stop for good, i often consider how moderation could work a few months/years down the line, but i remind myself of the withdrawal symptoms/ overwhelming emotions i had in the first week and how ultimately, weed will do nothing but make me foggy the next day and increase my anxiety/ disrupt my appetite and sleep and i will slip down the slope again. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading. Day 17 and counting. Taking each day at a time and every single day SOBER is an achievement, especially when I'm around it so much. I am in a very privileged position to quit as i have a job, a dog, access to a car and I don't have any rent to worry about, so i figure this is one of the easiest opportunities i will ever get to give it up. Especially seeing how much it has affected my parents after 40 years and their inability to stop. They are aware of my journey and tell me each day how proud they are of me, and I have already remarked how my positive change is having an impact on their attitude towards weed.

I'm 41 and became a daily smoker somewhere around 16 or 17 maybe, though I started even earlier than that. For so many years I carried around the burden. The hiding, the guilt, the panic when I would run out of weed, the fear of going to buy it or meeting new unknown dealers. 

I had a false belief that weed gave me something special, made me special and gave me an advantage over everyone else. I aligned with the culture and bought all the positive propaganda. I celebrated it. It was such a big part of who I was. Eventually I started growing my supply, it became legal and I grew even more committed to the lifestyle. I became more open about my use. I lied to myself that I was okay and happy with my life.

Weed really affected my mental health over the years and I choose to ignore it. It created a lot of negative thinking, brought about anxiety and at the same time it was essential, at the time, to control my mood and make me feel okay. It brought my happiness/contentment baseline way down from where it should normally be and depending on if I was high (and having a good experience) or not it would spike all over the place. 

I wasn't a horrible person and didn't live a horrible life. I was functional, a decent partner, decent dad but inside I was crumbling. I was frustrated with being hooked. I tried to quit many times over the years, never being able to get through more than a couple of weeks because I had always been ""white knuckling"" it, forcing it when in reality I didn't want to stop. At some point in the last few years I started to think about my use differently and I desperately wanted change. I knew it wouldn't be easy, I knew it would take time and would get worse before it got better. I was desperate to discover what life would be without weed in the picture. I focused on that, I focused on getting better and being active in improving the things about myself that I didn't like and wanted to change. 

The first 6 months were tough and it was basically me being focused on recovering. Somewhere around the 6 month mark things had improved so much that I started focusing more on my life and my goals of self improvement and moving on from weed. In many ways I feel like my life has just begun, at 41. Its not too late for me, and its not too late for you either, no matter where you are.",73,0

Calls went well, I had clarity and was able to get more done today between calls than before. Towards the end of work I decided why not go the full night too, so here I am.

I came up with every excuse in the book as to why I don’t think I’d ever be sober. I’m 23 and I thought I was the only one who went through tough shit (being previously homeless/living in a youth shelter, sexual & physical abuse, no family anymore). One day, I woke up and I stopped making excuses for myself.

This year made me realize how fucking strong I am and that I didn’t need the weed. My resilience getting through tough shit came from me, not from the weed. I wish I could have realized that sooner, but better late than never.

I’m happy I held myself accountable last year. I’m happy I’ve stopped smoking weed and drinking. I’m happy I only smoke cigarettes/vape socially once every couple months. I’m happy I finally know better.

Thank you for this sub, for holding me accountable and for not letting me make anymore excuses. I’ve become a better university student (entering my last year this September), a better cat dad, I have a car now from the money I’ve saved from smoking weed, etc.

I’m still a work in progress and I honestly crave weed everyday, but now I know I’m better off without it. Thanks for letting me share!",90,0

I waited it out and eventually it ended. The funny thing was I didn't really notice when it was over because I was busy paying attention to something else.

When I checked my tracker I'm 1 month and 11 days sober. I quit because weed finally caught up to me and dropped my life in the shit when I thought it was going perfectly. But reading these 2 top posts today they mentioned a relapse being a killer and I realised as much as I've been through hell physically and still am mentally, I can't see the point in going back to it ever. 

I don't want any applause for this mentality, I quit once before and I know how hard it is when it's just down to you so don't feel bad for going back to it! I just wanted to tell everyone, each time you wanna smoke to enjoy something, or relax or any reason you usually used to smoke, after continued daily use (10 years for me) that feeling it gives you is never what it was to begin with. Relapsing or just the odd occasion will never be what you want it to be if you're an addict. Yes it's different for everyone, I accept that. But when it was what it was for me, my main love and crux, I've noticed that I still enjoy the same things now sober, music sounds the same as it did before I quit, food still tastes as good and relaxing is exactly that, relaxing. 

Quitting hasn't turned my life around or changed my outlook and made me a better person but I know now that for years getting high has never been what it was at first. My biggest regret in life now isn't that I didn't quit sooner and take stock to save the pain I've been through recently, it's that I ever became fully hooked in the first place because if I hadn't, maybe I could have the odd smoke and enjoy those feelings I used to get at the start and I envy anyone who still can feel that way!

my dad passed away 2 years ago from cancer during a time where i had not started university yet. he was big on education and had a phd in mathematics. my dad and i weren’t on best of terms when he was alive and it’s something i regret deeply.



i used weed to get through the pain and i don’t think i will ever stop grieving him but that’s okay. all that time, just getting stoned out of my mind to numb the pain i needed to accept was normal. 



sometimes i wonder if i was still using, would i have gotten that dream, that sign from him?



anyways, i am so fucking glad i quit because the memory of this dream and the realization that he’s visiting me in my dreams and is here with me in spirit is so comforting. it’s a huge breakthrough in how i feel mentally about his death and i’m so happy i got to hug my dad again. i can smell him writing this. i can feel his hug. i love you dad.",268,0

In general all is fine and quitting 7+ months ago is the best decision for me in a long time. I feel my feelings, I have energy, brainfog is slowly better, I do sport, am more there for my family, dont have to go home to smoke when I am out, saved tons of money...

But today a big wave of regret came over me.
I guess that is normal with 20+ years of my life being dominated by that drug. I hated myself for not finding a real satisfiying career (studied art and had a nice time with scholarships for a while, but then sucked at doing good art with them)and was stuck with a job that was badly paid and I didnt really enjoy. Hate myself for not getting better at any hobby (guitar, taichi- basically all starting and then stopping again) and for not seeing my friends and family really. The social element is really the one that I found out to be a crazy one. As a smoker I hung out with my girlfriend also smoking and we would stop going out with really nice people..mainly artist, no stoners though. Also I did the shittiest financial decisions last year, having money I had to invest, then did it in the perfect moment in march20 and sold it three days later again because I was paranoid and afraid. A loss of 70k. Or no. No loss. Just no gain and inflation because I was since then frigthened and too stoned to do something wise with the money. Well the last 7 months I wasnt stoned. So no more excuse there and I did invest by now. But man. 
And there is more and more and more to hate myself for.

And my biggest one is not being there for my dad in the year before he died of cancer. I did have a job and I had one 1 year old and my wife pregnant. But I should have made the 4 hour car journey more often. Still regret that so much, even though I was in hospital with him the last two weeks and when he died.

Well. I just wanted to shout that out.
I know I have to look forward and forgive myself.
And a lot is also just me and not weed. But that lazy person who is hiding from decisions and the world has to grow up now. In his end 30s. Take responsibility. Get my shit together and work hard to grow and be a better version of myself especially as a dad.

Forgiving is so hard though most of the days.

The change happened after I had a truly harrowing epiphany that if I continued with the habit I would just destroy my health. There were so many times that I felt such deep anxiety after smoking that I was genuinely worried that I was having a heart attack, my chest was that tight. A lot of times it wasn't even fun anymore, smoking had just become a habit or a crutch to deal with the stress of existence. 

But the real kicker was when I started to actually feel *pain in my kidneys* after smoking or having an edible. It was so scary that I quit. This body/flesh-prison is the only one I've got and is the home to my consciousness, and as a general rule of thumb you do *not* want to screw up your kidneys.

Since I've quit I've been able to get my eating and fitness habits back on track, I sleep better, I feel more motivated, and I feel much less foggy throughout the day. Overall I'm feeling good and happy with my decision.

Most of the time I don't even miss weed. But damn, when I do, I really miss it. I miss feeling silly and spacey and just enjoying all the sensations that a nice high will bring. I haven't slipped up at all yet, but there are times when I really want to.

After that just turn any device u have off and just try and sleep maybe a hot shower would help before ur sleep by an hour or two. Or maybe u like listening to a podcast or any relaxing video to u. Anything works as long as you are able to sleep.

I use a sobriety tracking app to monitor my progress and I didn't know that there's a new bar that tracks months ! Never made it that far.

I used to get high and listen to a lot of experimental music and last night I was able to enjoy my favorite album while sober and it felt so good to know that I can have fun without weed just as much as with it.

I've tried to quit on at least 6 occasions this year alone and it's nice to get back the personality I have outside of smoking weed. I do think about it occasionally, but now I don't want it or crave it, and that's the biggest milestone for me.

somewhere in the last 2 years i started to de-prioritize everything that was not related to weed. i stopped all my interests/hobbies, i became apathetic and anti-social.

exam season is upon us soon and i figured i would take a break from smoking so i could think more clearly. what awaited me was one week of shakes, anxiety, insomnia, cold-sweat during the night, very VERY weird vivid dreams, obsessive thoughts about weed, decreased appetite and irritability. and this was from smoking once per night only, i can’t imagine the withdrawals more frequent smokers experience.

but i think the worst withdrawal from not smoking was BOREDOM. i was bored out of my fucking mind the first few days. but it turns out boredom can be very healthy. after literally staring into a wall for about a week i couldn’t take it anymore so i started on some old hobbies. i hit up some buddies and met up with them. it’s like entertainment-wise nothing could compare to smoking pot, but remove pot from the equation and my standards for being entertained dropped so drastically that just a walk outside was refreshingly stimulating. 

i was planing on starting smoking again after exam period, but now i’m not so sure i will.",43,0

I felt no pain only pleasure and coughing. I smoke harder and harder...,wake up i smoke ,before school i smoke , before lunch i smoke , literally everytime i managed to.Until it became to the point that smoking cant get me the same high as i wanted. I ate it raw . You wont believe it but it was a brick weed .I dont know how many toxics got into my body then i felt nothing then i cried .... i cried in my head it was all only bad thought.I was in a boarding school it was the same time that students assembled. My friends were  lookin for me they found me pass out on the floor.    I left school,went to see doctor panic attack,mama's cryin .i hate those times no one like me everybody treats me like shit, cant go outside ,i was so embrassed ,suicide got into my head but i didnt do it.Doctor's drugs help me to turn back to who i was.Started taking care of myself , calisthenics , eat healthier and my munchies tummy gone,went to new school get straight A and fell in love again...I was happier....



But the demon in me took over control.
the legalization of weed in many countries ,hiphop culture ,celebs. etc
but i dont blame them but it was because my heart's not strong enough...... mom found out ,i promised . mom found out again,i promised i wont . I lied , borrowed, not enough allowance to eat. i hate myself
Yesterday my mom also caught me rollin joints. i made her cried again .why im such an idiot . I want to have a good career ,good life. it made me lazy,burn out ,my scores dropped,


But Today is the day i decided to be better,will go to rehab center this weekend.

Super lurker here, was curious as to what others experience was with cannabis withdrawal? I believe that because I have struggled with mental health issues including anxiety and depression and have employed strategies such as routine meditation, psychotherapy, a healthy lifestyle (sleep, diet, exercise), meditation, and am a sensitive person to my own mind and body that I have noticed that while quit for 31 days now I am still experiencing subtle mood swings and panic attacks. 

I was a heavy, heavy cannabis user for the last 9 years, and smoked heavy before those 9 but had a forced break due to a run-in with the law. I’m turning 32 in July, and started smoking when I was 14, regularly and heavily by 19. I feel so duped by the common rationalization saying cannabis is “harmless.” Pisses me the fuck off. I also worked in the industry since I was 19 as well, furthering my consumption and rationalization as to why being high all day was “totally ok.” Just curious if anyone has experienced drawn out symptoms and is PAWS a reality with cannabis too?",6,0
915,2021-05-13 02:17:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/nb9zzf/what_they_dont_tell_you/,What they don’t tell you...,"In January 2021 I took control of my weed addiction and gave up everything. I got rid of all my weed accessories/tools, my old contacts, and even all my lighters. 

I went through physical withdrawal for a week: sweating, shaking, insomnia, irritability and mental fogginess. During my withdrawal period, I was mistreated by my family, hospitalized for a surgery, and dealing with grief. My life was overwhelmingly sad, I had reasons to resort back to weed, so I did! 

So many friends wanted to session; I reasoned that as long as I wasn’t buying it, or doing it everyday, I was still improving. In total, I slipped up four times but still managed an entire month and some change without smoking! That was the longest I’ve gone in the last 8 years.

However, my mentality about weed began to shift, the physical withdrawal symptoms I experienced initially showed me that  my body was addicted to weed or else it wouldn’t even have a “withdrawal” period. 

A thought that had never occurred to me before because I always downplayed my habits as just something I did and not something I was. I began to realize that smoking isn’t  a “thing”, instead being a smoker is. 

When you’re a weed smoker, every opportunity feels like a signal to go ahead and get high. Parents gone? Get high. Off work early? Get blazed. It’s Friday? Buy an eighth! I had to realize that smoking became a religion to me, a ritual to complete at least 2-3 times a day if not more. For no other reason than because I was unaware I was an addict. 

The fact that not smoking causes me to feel anxiety like life or people are getting in the way of what I “really want to do” showed me that I’m a smoker. I smoke to drive, I smoke to watch tv, or be around my family and peers. 

I don’t smoke because I’m on a tropical getaway or even in Colorado, I smoked because I didn’t know how NOT to. I had to ACCEPT the fact that I smoke because I’m physically and mentally addicted to it, and socially handicap to it. 

We live in a society that enables unhealthy habits that lead to addictions many are unaware of.  Socially, we’re subjected to a culture we’re drinking/smoking with friends is considered “OKAY”, as long as it’s not something you struggle with. The weed/mimosa bar doesn’t care if these are habits that people are struggling with daily, and not just outings they have on Saturday’s. 

Pop culture has normalized social interactions that feed into addictions and we’ve also down played/over played what addiction looks like/what it means.  

You’re not addicted to a hard substance so you don’t feel like you’re in recovery or that you’re even an addict. Life feels bland and you have that thought in the back of your mind saying “just smoke, it’s just weed.” 

It’s not though, what your friends, peers, PBS, what they don’t tell you is you have an addiction. You can’t go a day without partaking in a habit. You hate what weed has done but you don’t know how or what stopping your usage looks like. It’s always going to be easier to “just get high”, but so much harder to be honest and accountable for your behavior.  

Once you choose to stop smoking and it’s like a part of your identity has been lost. Mentally you conclude that you can no longer be around the same friends or enjoy the same experiences because you don’t get high anymore.

 You either resent weed for the years you feel like you’ve wasted on it or you start to subconsciously desire it even more than before because you realize life hasn’t changed just your everyday habits have. 

The quote: “The party, where dreams die”,  is so true! We are all vulnerable to loosing ourself in “good nights”. So much so, we start chasing the lifestyle of always having sex, smoking, drinking, etc instead of allowing ourselves to just experience  life even if there’s no  proverbial parties that day. 

Life isn’t always going to be a party nor should it be! Because next thing you know you start to feel like YOU are the party instead of realizing you were just attending one.

The perfect session where you “feel amazing and you have no work in the morning and you don’t have munchies but you can enjoy a good meal and you’re not anxious but creative and you’re not lazy just relaxed” doesn’t exist. If it does exist, then you’ve already had it once so do you really need it again, better yet, everyday? Smoking weed is essentially like chasing a dragon, it’ll always be evasive and quick. It’ll never be fulfilling or provide deep reward. 

Today, I threw out all the accessories I bought when I fell off the wagon. I had lasted that month and some change and now, two months later I’m back in the thick of my addiction. Back making excuses to be outside all day so i don’t have to hear any complaints about the smell, back copping twice a week, back feeling anxious whenever I’m not high. 

And you know the crazy part? Just to drive, just to go to my next destination. That’s what every day is like. Getting high so you can feel personally fulfilled yet creatively or physically neglected because so many things have to take the back seat to smoking. Including your genuine thoughts, even the ones you dislike. 

Im confident in my ability to effectively transition from being a smoker because I perceive my weed habits differently and no longer want the burden of it. 

The pain that life can bring doesn’t stop because I’m smoking or not smoking, there is no round of applause for any length of time I remain sober, and there’s not a high I haven’t experienced already. 

Life is all about perspective, that’s why the opposite of this forum is one that uplifts weed and anything weed culture. If weed isn’t an addiction for you, then it’s just not. 

IF IT IS THOUGH, like it was for me, I think transparency is the best thing you can do for yourself. If you really want to see a difference, you have to really examine your behavior/your mentality about said behaviors and soul search. 

Do you want to be a smoker if you are? What does being a smoker look like for you personally? Are you functioning? Is getting high still a high or a commitment you don’t want to end? 

Yes, I am an addict. My addiction has caused me to act abnormally depending on the situation, and I’ve met some terrible but amazing people. However, weed still isn’t a thing. People are allowed to smoke, my friends, my family, my peers. ME? I’m choosing to engage in new behaviors/patterns. 

Take away the power you feel the addiction has and restore it to yourself internally, you can choose to stop and you don’t need recognition (I’m giving all of you, including myself our flowers) because when you create the narrative of “I’m no longer a smoker”, you potentially put yourself at risk of either resenting or desiring your addiction. 

When neither should happen; yes you have an addiction, yes you’re an addict, and yes it’s hard. You can overcome it though and if no one else acknowledges your struggles and the fight you put up against stagnancy then  make sure YOU do. 

Make sure you understand you engage in unhealthy habits, YOU are not the habit. 

 It’s okay to put the weed down, it’s okay to take a cleanse, it’s okay to stop feeding into your wants/desires, and instead feed your fears/anxiety by reaching new milestones you had written off for yourself. 

I BELIEVE IN EVERYONE struggling through the transition of no longer being a slave to addiction and I hope I can inspire discourse.  Thank you for reading, good luck! xxxxx.",340,0

I was smoking daily for 3 years and wanted nothing more than to quit. Every day I told myself I would, but then found myself buying more. I had a very moving experience during my reiki training that made me stop. The first few weeks were MISERABLE all I could get myself to do was stare at the wall and think about how badly I wanted to smoke. Then, it got better. The urges were way less frequently and I found myself able to do things without thinking about smoking. I'm still doing those things, studying Metaphysics, spending time with those I love, etc. But lately I've rediscovered just how boring life actually is. It's like every day is the exact same. Which is the exact reason why I was unable to stop smoking for 4 years, it made me not care how boring it was. I would love to do new things, like take some classes in things that I'm interested in, but still everything is online and that's just not for me. I've been wanting to smoke more and more and I really don't know what to do at this point. I want to be able to smoke a couple times a week without getting addicted again, but I fear I will. A big reason why I stopped and wanted to stop is because I feared weed would delay or put a pause on my spiritual growth and that's the most important thing to me. What do I do?

My \~10 months hadn't been terribly hard to get through. I had a strong resolve when I first quit (a year ago at the end of this month). I cut off all contacts with dealers and made weed very out of reach for myself. 

Things went well, I did a lot of good things with my life like doing an online school program and finding a new career. Overall, things were better and I was proud of myself. Well, at least at first. After a while, the novelty and pride from quitting weed kinda wore off. I guess I started taking it for granted. 

Anyways, I was introduced to Delta-8 when I was over a friend's house, which was a recipe for relapse. I think I caved because I had been feeling disconnected from my sobriety and disinterested in resisting cravings. I used to look at my Grounded tracking app every night just to see my little tree growing, but that last month I wasn't really doing that anymore. I also felt like I *wanted* to be put in a situation where I was offered some weed just so I could relapse, but yet have that kind of built-in excuse where it isn't the same as going out and buying weed myself. 

A couple days after trying it, I went to a local tobacco store and got myself a D8 cart and pen. Did that for a month or so. Then the last week or two I was taking D8 edibles which really sent me down the rabbit hole and got me to realize ""ok it's time to make a change again""

I guess it's almost like war. I knew how to battle the enemies of THC carts and flower which I used to buy from dealer friends. I live in a state where you can get medical (not recreational), so I didn't have to worry about dispensaries. I knew that I would never follow through with getting a medical card because that's expensive and takes days. But D8 was a new enemy I was not prepared for. 

I got ambushed at my friends house with it and I wasn't prepared for dealing with it, so I failed the test. I never shopped at tobacco stores in my state or heard much of D8 so it was easy for mind to chalk it up as something *different,* like a clever way to have your cake and eat it too. 

And to be frank, it's not like I'm an idiot. I *knew* that D8 was basically the same thing and that I would end up back here talking about starting over the moment I went down that road. But it didn't *feel* exactly like I was relapsing. But at the same time I kinda knew I was bullshitting myself and that I would be a hypocrite if I talked about the power of quitting weed yet also smoking D8 carts. 

I think this boils down to the fact that our logical brains and emotional brains are two different things. Logically, I knew I was wrong. But we tend to make decisions emotionally and I didn't have the strength at that time to overcome it. Hence that whole experience where it's like ""I want to quit but I can't.

&#x200B;

tldr;

\- had \~10 months completely clean from thc 

\- relapsed with delta 8

\- checked myself before I wrecked myself

\- learned a lesson

\- came back here to talk about it

\- back on the right path (day 3 after quitting d8)",23,0

I started smoking about 3 years ago. I'm 34, and I grew up around weed. But during my time growing up, I always avoided it.

I tried it a few years ago for the first time because I was so stressed, and nothing helped at all. I fell in love with it. 
Recently I've been trying to quit, but after a few days I can't take the calling anymore and I get more.

I feel so destroyed right now, it's been about 6ish days now? Or 5? And I broke down and got a tad bit.

At work I easily turn down dab pens left to right constantly. But when I'm alone, I can't. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of trying to stop and going back to it. I've had some extremely good and stressful days lately, more good than stressful, but last night I ran into some more issues, and this morning I broke.

Does it get easier? With how addicted I feel, I don't know if I can do this.",3,0

I grinded it up and rolled it, all whilst the drama in my household raged in the background deafening everything but one small voice.

The part of me who knew I shouldn’t do this spoke up albeit a whisper and I did something I’ve never done before...

I threw it all out. All of it. 

I didn’t even take one pull of the joint I rolled, I snapped it in half and threw it out with the bag.

I’m feeling sad I picked up to begin with, stupid as I just spent money to literally throw it out, scared I’m not strong enough for the long haul, upset due to the bad night ahead BUT I’m proud of myself. 

I never ever thought I’d be able to throw out weed like I just have & I’m so proud I managed to do it.

My girlfriend doesn’t like when I smoke. She says she’d never ask me to change, but I know she’d be more comfortable if I quit. She doesn’t drink or smoke either. I’ve cut back significantly since we’ve been seeing each other just because I don’t smoke whenever I spend time with her. It’s time to finally take that jump and quit for real. I don’t want to lose her and then look back and realize that it was the weed that made her lose interest. I want to be fully present for her and I don’t want to do anything to make her uncomfortable.

I’ve asked him to keep the weed in his car while he’s at work (I work from home) so the temptation isn’t there.

This last November, I noticed that my energy was low, motivation was in the toilet, and I was seriously on the verge of throwing away my undergraduate degree—(I just graduated a week ago!).

So I decided to tell my father in law and ask for his help. He is a very self disciplined man and has been a role model for me for longer than I have even known his daughter (long story). Anyways, I asked him if he would be alright meeting regularly so I could pee in a cup for a test. He gladly obliged and has not been judgmental whatsoever. I had tried so many times to quit, but I always left a door open for falling back into the trap. This way, I have been able to stay on the wagon because there is no way that I will present a dirty sample for him.

I am so thankful I was able to make that difficult leap back then, because I just got a job in which random, regular drug testing occurs. I know that I would have a really hard time quitting cold turkey now and the stress would keep me from doing my best at the job. Now, I am stoked to continue to pee cleanly regularly and have no stress about it whatsoever!

This has caused a snowball effect with family and friends. Before, I was a ‘high functioning’ stoner and genuinely no-one knew I was constantly stoned, I never worked all last year and this caused me to have no reason to have the mini breaks that going to work during the day would force me to have.

How I feel - constantly have a sense of impending doom, feel incredibly anxious, keep crying from being overwhelmed, feel the absolute worst of all time.

I’ve had addiction issues in the past and remember feeling this terrible for a year after coming off of another substance, the thought of feeling this way for that long again is almost too much.

Is anyone going though the same? I feel like I need the support to make it through this, my doctor was unhelpful and recommended CBT, I’ve arranged a therapist for support but my anxiety has convinced me I am going to spiral even further.

Been a daily smoker since I got out of the army. Back when I was enlisted I could only smoke on days off so was sort of forced to take long breaks. Since I got out I’ve had no real reason not to smoke every day.

I thought about bringing bud, but realized this was the perfect opportunity to prove to myself that I’m still in control. Went four nights without smoking, then had a little on the weekend (was not on camp), and now finishing my second four day break in two weeks. 

I’m so proud of myself but I’ve got no one to share it with cos the staff are straight as a bean. I’m still young and don’t find that weed affects my life in a bad way so I don’t plan to quit indefinitely, but it’s great to be reassured that I actually can stop when I need to.

At first, it was great. Go to class during the day, and smoke at night with my friends. But then, it evolved into smoking in the morning. Then smoking throughout the day. I began to become stoned every moment of the day - and it reflected in my academic performance and my financials.

""Whatever,"" I thought, ""Everything will end out just fine. I'll figure it out later."" And then I smoked more.

When I came home from college, I continued to smoke. I did not use it to relieve stress anymore. It became almost a dependency for me. Smoke before and after chores. Smoke before and after eating. Smoke before and after anything. I rarely set aside the time to hang out with my family and friends. My life revolved around being high; the only time I was sober was at work.

I finally broke down yesterday night. All the pent-up anger and sadness and regret inside me poured out and no amount of marijuana could stop it. It was the lowest I have ever felt.

After viewing this subreddit (and watching numerous YouTube videos on quitting weed), I think I have the mindset to stop. **I have come to realize marijuana made me settle for what I have instead of trying to achieve my goals and aspirations**. Today was my first day sober in a long time. I joined my local gym and ran for a bit. I picked up some extra hours at work. I visited my grandfather's grave for the first time in a long time and started tearing up again.

My life flipped around in a matter of months due to my usage of marijuana, and I hope to put it back on track due to my quitting of marijuana.

I smoked one or two a night to help with pain and insomnia but my mental health was in the gutter. Since stopping I've had nothing but energy and motivation, my depression and anxiety have all but disappeared and I've been reconnecting with family and friends (something I'd been trying to do but never managed). 

Unfortunately sleping is a problem again, I lie awake for hours and when I do sleep, damn the dreams are something else but on the plus side I feel more revitalised than before when waking.

The only problem is I've been hitting alcohol and tobacco twice as hard. On top of that my libido is through the roof. I'm assuming it's just my mind trying to make up for the lack of weed by focusing on other vices but it's really starting to get to me now. Anyone else had the same problem? Any advice on dealing with these issues?",5,0

I crave weed only when I really start to feel the monotony of life. It isn’t helpful to be depressed. Substance abuse almost feels inevitable. I don’t really drink at least. 

When you quit, the hardest part is realizing that you will not always progress. There will still be step backwards and forgetfulness and lack of hygiene and anxiety and isolation. At least for me. I guess you just have to realize why you started smoking in the first place. I was depressed and I chose to use weed as a way to escape from the way life felt. But, I still hate myself on most days and lately I’ve felt especially tired. I hate waking up in the morning. I can barely make it to the night without feeling like I’ll faint from exhaustion.

Recently I have arrived in Canada and due to covid restrictions I am being forced to quarantine for 14 days in a hotel completely isolated from my family and friends and drugs. Initially I was very scared about being alone and how am I going to deal with everything and my drug addiction. And believe me or not in my fourth day of quarantine my girlfriend broke up with me. It felt like the sky was shattering up on me. Felt like God hated me that's why he is making me suffer this much. You know in movies we see wives of prissoners coming to them and asking for devorce? I exactly know how they felt. And i sympathize for them. Its really hard to deal with addiction breakup while u are locked up. But today is my 12th day and i feel better than ever. Initially i thought i would have never leave my weed habbit and if my ex brokeup with me when i was not in quarantine i would definitely smoke weed all day trying to deal with me depression. But this quarantine has taught me to deal with my problems like how a sober person would. It was very hard the first 5 days but now i feel like my heart has started healing. And with that said i also dont want to smoke pot any more. I like being sober. Being in control of my emotions thoughts and activities.  And most importantly i feel like i realized when there is no one, there is god. So i seek to god for forgiveness and may god help me and everyone  here  stay sober.

i would have died this weekend but i couldnt get enough pressure with the cat leash on my neck to make me pass out, moved on to another plan, but stopped when i had the right materials out of spite. why should i die when all the ones who abandoned and abused me keep living on?

my problems, schmee schmooblegms right? the negative feedback loops in my head continually play episodes of loss. all the betrayals, scorn, abandonment and ostracizing i've experienced in my life come to a head and i feel like, what a waste.

this is where the autofiction comes in. i've found that if i'm able to write things out, i can treat each episode more like a zen koan to be meditated over. the mere experience of reifying what has happened, my feelings, and how to move forward gives me a sense of belonging that i long for.

the thing about being lonely is, that i spend an inordinate amount of time brooding about other people and this has given me a very high ethical standard that most people can't live up to. this kind of exacerbates the feelings of loneliness, as who am i supposed to connect with fully? at every turn i have to dull myself down just to be able to deal with the people around me. david foster wallace killed himself trying to crack this nut, and im not having much success either.",3,0

I've done a good job of not letting it interfere with work and other commitments, but for the past month or so I've been going through a 1/4oz a week. I tried a few approaches to limit how much and how frequently I was smoking, but it always turned into a mindless habit until I ran out and had to restock.  


I've had on and off issues with depression for most of my life, and weed has genuinely helped me deal with it in a healthy manner in the past. But now that life is starting to return to ""normal"" and I can't use it in a healthy way any more I need to find other things. Better ways to take care of myself I guess. But goddamn, today I'm so depressed I had to take work off and it is an awful feeling. I am fighting every instinct to buy more and get high again. But I'm also ready to find alternative ways of dealing with this. I don't really know how to do it, but I know that weed isn't going to actually help anything. It's just going to give me an avenue to tune out of the world and my own thoughts and emotions. Which honestly sounds tempting sometimes, but now that I've been vaxxed there are so many things I want to do and I know I won't do them if I cave now.

I feel like my natural personality is starting to come back (turns out I like to sing to myself and sometimes even talk to myself, lol). I feel more present with myself and others. Seems like this time quitting is lacking in the painful withdrawal symptoms that triggered my relapse  in past attempts. I did deal with nausea this time, but it is starting to resolve now, thankfully. 

There is a new energy that comes with being sober, somewhat of an intensity that I think I always tried to dim down. I definitely feel like I’m what the new age peeps call “resonating on a higher frequency” in a sense, which is a gift but also requires me to channel that energy sufficiently. It can easily build up and become too much to handle, so I do need to find proper outlets. 

I feel like my faith (I am somewhat religious but obviously not enough to have avoided pot lol) is stronger too. Perhaps it’s because I’m more able to be intellectually stimulated by things that I listen to/read/study, and I also feel free from any bondage over my mind. 

I am starting to feel lots of love for my family and people around me (I think I always had it in me, but it definitely feels intense too, sometimes I think I love too much, maybe some codependency too?). 

Starting to think that I am just naturally very empathic and feelings can be overwhelming sometimes; which is why I felt the need to numb out. 

The next step is throwing out or giving away this bong... but I definitely feel some sentimentality creeping in. It was a gift. I think maybe it’s presence here comforts me because I think “I have a bong and weed just in case” even though I do NOT want to be high.  

I have something called “intermittent gratification” with weed.. meaning, sometimes I have a really chill experience when I smoke ... but most of the time, it produces anxiety, guilt, fear, paranoia... but the good experiences were enough to keep me in the cycle of addiction. 

I feel so much more awake and bright now. 

Try to keep yourselves surrounded by positivity. I listened to some YouTube quitting weed testimonies and it helped redirect me when I found myself wanting to self-regulate my new bursts of energy with weed .

- if I have enough cash on me to pick up later (or even enough money in my bank account for that matter) 
- if I’ll ever be able to save money since all of it goes towards weed
- if I’ll be home in time before my dealer stops for the night 
- if I’ll have the motivation to do anything while high (including things like showering or laundry) 
- if I have enough papers, lighters, filters, etc at home 
- if I’ll ever be able to stop smoking 24/7 so I can get my life together 
- if I’ll be able to graduate my masters program while still smoking a lot 
- if my depression and anxiety will ever go away
- if I’ll ever get in shape since I eat so many munchies and I’m too high to work out 
- if I can sneak hitting my weed pen wherever I am 
- if my family will ever find out how much I smoke 
- if I’ll ever be able to wake up on a Saturday morning and do normal people things like go run errands or read the newspaper
- if I’ll be drug tested at work 
- if weed is negatively affecting my bipolar disorder 
- if my social life will ever get better since I spend so much time alone, smoking weed in bed 
- if I’ll ever feel happy and proud of myself 
- if life will ever get easier 
- if I won’t always need weed to sleep and if my sleeping schedule will ever be normal
- if I slept through my food delivery, which I often did

I always felt bad instantly, like a failure, weak, not capable of keeping my word, my promises, not capable of getting my shit together, take responsibility.

When I read about your experiences it helps me a lot to see that I am not the only person that uses to fall into that trap. And reading other people’s experience I don’t judge them  or think of them being weak or such things - on the contrary! 

Maybe the harsh judgments I throw at myself are A PART OF MY PROBLEM. 🤔
Maybe I should be more compassionate with myself, go on searching for the reasons for my toxic relationship with weed and accept that falling into the trap is a part of the problem. That it is problematic, of course, but that it does not determine my person or my capability of doing better.

Every relapse has been the beginning of a new try. I got more experience with every try. More experience I can rely on, I can trust into and that can support me in fighting the craves.

In covid i feel especially alone and isolated from my family, even though i was never particularly close to them, the feeling of losing my baseline and being totally out of control makes me miss them even more. I used to indulge the paranoia as a kind of self harm, to ""make me even stronger"" socially, to power through it and dissociate. I don't know what happened to me, but with friends smoking was different, but now I'm at a dire, isolated place and i can't trust myself, my intuition, or my relationships. When I'm high, everything translates as manipulation being done to me and I'm over-processing situations like a Google deep-dream AI to ""stay ahead of the game"" but really I'm probably spiralling into a psychosis. I can't trust myself to make the right relationships anymore and don't know who i am. 

I haven't smoked any weed today. After crying for two days straight my throat muscles hurt, i feel exhausted, but I'm a little bit clearer. The longest I've quit before was last summer for two months. I need to sell my stash and figure my life out head on. I'm very grateful for reading the stories in this Sub tonight and feel very affirmed about the psychological fucked-upness that can be brought on by sativa in my case. Anyway, thanks 🙏 i look forward to joining this and other self-betterment and recovery communities.",7,1

I’m still worried if this is something that’s part of the new me or if this is withdrawals. It scares me because I absolutely refuse to take meds for anything. I didn’t decide to quit to trade my addiction in for another. If that’s the case I’ll just toke up again and take my chances with tree. But I’m glad I made it 2 days. On to day 3 and we’ll see how this goes. I genuinely want to quit. I want to change. Weed doesn’t make me feel the way it used to. I feel like I only smoked to avoid the shitty feeling I wake up to in the morning (which I guess is withdrawals) and when I do smoke it’s only to feel balanced again. Right now it’s hard for me to do anything, but when I was high I never wanted to do anything but sit at home, play video games and smoke after work. I want to change all that. The hardest part for me is finding new friends who don’t smoke. I went through my entire contact list to see who wants to hangout to get my mind off this shit and every single friend on my phone smokes weed and would rather do nothing but sit at home and play video games. I’m not really a gym guy, probably never will be so I’ve been looking for people to play basketball with but no one wants to cause they’re all stoned all the time. All my sober friends moved out of town. I just hope this all gets better. I had to quit because I got locked up for 8 months 12 years ago for selling weed. So I was sober for a whole 8 months and I was fine. The anxiety could of arguably been from being away from family and friends, but when I got out I felt a whole lot better about myself then I started smoking again for 11 years straight. I hope I can get there again this time and maintain my progress.",5,0

Using a throwaway for reasons, but I just wanted to share a bit about my journey, especially since this is my second time quitting. 

My first time quitting was New Years 2020 (so about a year and a half ago). At that time, I wanted to quit so I could improve my relationship with my boyfriend and family, but deep down, I wasn't really ready to give up weed. I used weening as means to cut down how much I smoked, but deep down, it was really just an excuse to keep smoking. I would only be able to think about taking those one or two dabs at the end of the day, and eventually I gave myself the excuse that it was COVID/quarantine and I could quit again next year when everything's all said and done. 

Fast forward to about a week ago, when I got my second dose of the COVID vaccine. Having smoked for another year and a half (very heavily, I might add), I realized that it's time to give it up for good. The moment I was delaying was finally here. I don't know what clicked this time (I think it was the heavy abuse that made me so depressed from it and sick of it), but I was ready to really give it up. Given how heavily I smoked, I knew that I couldn't just quit cold turkey and was scared to try weening again. But I really surprised myself. I set up a plan to only take one dab at night, and even then, the first few days were hell. I didn't really have an appetite and I couldn't even sleep since one dab was so much less than what I was used to. I was just eating yogurt and fruit. But about 4 or 5 days in, I started to stomach some food for dinner aside from yogurt and fruit. And today, I had a full lunch and a full dinner without smoking beforehand, and I enjoyed both meals. 

I know I still have a long ways to go, especially since I might lose even more appetite once I kick the nightly dab (probably in a week). But I can't deny the progress I see. I don't even think about wanting to take the night dab, and I think about smoking a lot less, in general. I definitely think that this round of weening saved me from a lot of night nausea and dry heaving, and I truly believe the transition to smoke-free life will be a LOT easier having done this. While everyone's milage may vary, I hope this helps anyone who's debating whether to quit cold turkey or over time. It really depends on you and how well you know yourself, but it IS possible. 

Sending good vibes to everyone. Thankful for this community where I can share this :)",5,4

it could be an occasional thing. If I can manage that, wouldn't that be nice.""

Insidious thoughts that sound like my own convictions.

I've come to recognize unlikely environments that trigger cravings.

The attempt for moderation lead into a month of daily use.

I find myself using this year's chaos as an excuse at times.

But I've proven to myself in the past that the chaos is better dealt with sober.

It gives me a much better sense of control through it all.

So here's a list of some of the reasons I feel much better sober.

I've come to these conclusions over the course of years.

Some of which I forget along the way. This will serve as a reminder.

&#x200B;

I have Attention Deficit Disorder, I can't afford to sacrifice **concentration, focus**.

It seems to be near impossible for me to study when I'm high.

I can't stick to it or remember what I've learned.

It kills my **motivation**, I already struggle with that as it is.

I haven't had very sharp **memory** ever since I was young, this just adds to the problem.

I tend to avoid watching shows I like or reading books while high since I know I won't retain it, this reduces the quality of my leisure time.

I feel **self-conscious** around others when I'm high.

Social interactions are altered, often for the worse.

**Overthinking** is something I have overcome throughout the years, which makes it more noticeable when I revert back into that mindset.

Simple daily tasks often become more difficult. I become **uncoordinated, clumsy.**

Thinking about my future is much more **daunting** once I'm high.

My sense of long term progress is stunted because each morning feels like a hard reset, my goals are blurred and my memory is foggy.

I feel **grumpy** during the day before I get high. My base line mood is lower.

This creates a sense of longing for the evening so I can get high again.

I often feel **unsatisfied** as a result.

Over time, the longer I use the earlier in the day I start.

I know cannabis affects my **quality of sleep**. 

I don't wake up feeling recharged as I should.

I'm athletic and proper recovery during sleep is import to me.

My athletic performance takes a hit in general, feeling **groggy, lower stamina.**

I find myself **skipping workouts** or cutting them short since I rather get high.

Healthy food loses it's appeal once I'm high.

**Munchies** are annoying, feeling hungry when full is a nuisance.

I don't want to spend my days **chasing** a high.

As my **tolerance** creeps up and the habit becomes more and more costly.

I want to save my **money**. Not spend it on a habit that no longer serves me.

I crave **clarity** of mind.

I know at times the clarity can be bothersome but learning to overcome whatever is uncomfortable in those moments will help me deal with those feelings more effectively.

I want to **be in control** of my actions and not be swayed and manipulated by a substance.

&#x200B;

Today I felt like trash but I knew why of course.

I was very near to giving in but didn't so I'm pleased with myself for that.

I also have already noticed how it’s helping me financially. I had birthday money and instead of blowing it all on weed, i paid some bills and got myself some good food. I also don’t eat as much now that I’m not stoned 24/7. I’m really proud of myself and I know my parents are too.

After many lazy attempts to quit, I threw all my stuff away and decided I was done. For the first few days, I felt like a million bucks. I was so proud to have made the decision and was damn near excited for all the tough times ahead of me. I was hardly eating anymore, but when I did, it felt great. I’d listen to music and play games and felt like I was doing it as the “real me,” not just stoned me. I’d get in a good mood out of nowhere and just be so pleased that stopping weed had done all of this so quickly and easily. I’d just smile sometimes. I guessed this euphoric feeling wouldn’t last, and I was right.

I’m now on the end of day 7, and I feel bored with it all. It’s not that I want to smoke, it’s that I want something, anything, to fill the gap that weed and that temporary euphoria has left behind. I’ll exercise some, play with my cat, healthy things like that, but once I stop, all it takes is 5 minutes of sitting still and I let out a huge sigh and think “well now what?”

Now it’s starting to really bum me out. I’m not even worried about starting back smoking, I’m worried about staying off it and finding, if not creating, new problems for myself, just to fill some kind of mental gap. I know it’s still early and I have a lot ahead of me, but not being excited about it really sucks. I’m afraid my lack of interest will lead to a relapse. Even making this post, with all the thought and emotion that went into it, feels bland and dry to me.

I guess the reason is because I feel like I don’t have much to contribute to this sub anymore. I’m 160 days clean and I’m just living my life now. I moved states 3 weeks ago and I’ve just been job hunting and adjusting to living with people who party too hard, and that’s describing it lightly. It’s a complex situation and it’s not ideal for me, but I just have to ride it out for a bit. I am still grateful because without these people my move would have been essentially impossible.

There was a house party last week and I enjoyed myself. Plenty of opportunity to get high if I wanted to, but I can easily say it’s not for me anymore and just pass on it while still having a good time. I have worked hard to create good reasons to NOT get high. I have lost a ton of weight, I exercise, I feel in touch with myself and my emotions, I’m more productive and motivated than I have ever been, I worked hard to accept myself and my past mistakes and to now keep my eyes on the future and live in the present. Life is not perfect but I’m moving in a direction I WANT to go. I had two interviews today and I have two more scheduled for tomorrow. After I find a stable job here, I’m looking to buy my own house.

The first 2-3 months of staying clean were tough, incredibly challenging, I would be lying if I said anything otherwise. But it has been so very worth it. In short, I feel like the adult I’m supposed to be. I feel my life is moving forward in a positive direction instead of staying stagnant. And the best part is the sense of peace. I feel like I stopped fighting myself, stopped regretting the past, stopped hating myself, stopped trying to mindlessly numb myself into self-acceptance. 

I’m not here to tell you some exaggerated fairy tale that staying clean will fix all your problems. It won’t. We create our own problems, and we fix our own problems. But the fixing is much easier and simpler with a clean head and a light heart. This journey has been worthwhile just for the sense of peace and calm I feel every day. Add on all of the other benefits I’ve created and I can tell you I have no desire to go back. I have zero desire for a “one time” rendezvous because there is a (strong) chance I lose all of this if I do.

No thanks! Peace and love, trust the process, keep placing one foot in front of the other and moving forward. My first 2-3 months were pure shit, and now I’m telling you I wouldn’t give my sobriety up for the world. You can do this.",46,0

Had 9 months clean. Got a lot of shit together in my life and quitting weed was really helpful for that at first. 

I think that after a while it's easy to forget why we bother to even quit in the first place. The benefits become commonplace and weed feels like a distant memory. 

But then I made a small slip up that turned into relapsing for about a month or two. And recently it got to a point where I realized that I'm going to fuck up everything I worked for if I keep on going down the wrong path. So I need to go back down the right path so that I can depend on myself to do the right things when it matters.

I knew I could get bud elsewhere, but I knew it would not be as good quality as my go-to. This made me start to think - do I even get high anymore? Why am I smoking if I don't get high?

I realized I was using weed to numb myself. I have a very active mind that almost never stops thinking about something. Weed for me was an escape from what I was most afraid of - being myself, having my own thoughts, and expressing myself. It was much easier to spend a Saturday night high on the couch than it was going out with my friends (coronavirus also did not help, but I would avoid even small get togethers and events). I was miserable. But the most important part of the quitting process for me was this realization that I was not happy. Weed did not make me happy any more. It was not as fun as getting high with friends freshman year of college. It had become my crutch. So I decided I would not try to get more weed. And it worked.

Quitting cold turkey has gone better than expected. The only side effect I've really experienced is insomnia. One reason I was scared to quit initially was the side effects. But once I had my big realization, I prioritized my health over the anxiety of withdrawals. And that helped propel my body to feel better during this process. My friends have noticed my disposition change, my energy come back, and I realized that after two days of not smoking that my working memory was coming back after remembering my friends exact order at a restaurant. I feel like I can do things now, instead of thinking about doing things like I did while high.

This is a long post but, if you're a long time stalker of this sub and you are looking for one reason to quit, this is it. Dependency is real. And it's not fun to smoke weed when you don't get high!

I’ve tried to get him to cut down with me in the past; it worked once, and we spent maybe 2-3 months only smoking on the weekends. But we went back to it. 

I’m ready to cut down / quit again, but he doesn’t want to. I know I shouldn’t force him to quit if he isn’t ready (we have been arguing about this and it has already almost ended our otherwise great relationship). 

But there are two issues. 
1. I genuinely don’t know if I can quit with the influence of someone smoking in the same house as me every day. He has said he will try to keep it away, but he’ll have to come inside eventually and he will be obviously stoned... which I feel will make me want to be stoned again even more than I want that now :( 

2. If I have quit, I can’t imagine wanting to be in a serious relationship with a stoner. I love him so much, but I can see how weed is stagnating both of our lives. So do I try to make him quit with the risk of me “controlling” him ending the relationship? Or do I leave it and try to have the strength to leave the relationship if his smoking continues to hold me back from sobriety? 

I’m so afraid that if he doesn’t quit (or cut down to weekends), I’ll end up addicted again 😓

Even as a child (now 32) I had a awful temper small things turn into big things White Hot rage never hit anyone or attacked anyone but have broken doors and said so many things I would regret  later as I got older it only got worse tried working with doctors and counsellors even become a youth worker & counsellor myself to help understand my problem and work with young people to help them from my experiences.
Then a friend convinces me to try green I'm 28 at the time what I gift from the gods i think but as time goes by my tolerance goes up I buy more and more I smoke more and more.

Now anytime I try to quit I become a mean aggressive angry person which I can't be as I have a 4yr old son and I don't want him to see his dad being an complete PoS.

So I'm trying again it's been only 12hrs and I want a smoke but I don't want to be addicted to a herb anymore if I could go the medical route I would but Australia sucks and is so far behind the world on this.

I've seen so many people with much worse addictions on this sub and I read all the strong people trying to change themselves I just need to keep trying I know but just so hard at the end of day.

28 days of sobriety on 2 555 fucking days 🤯

I used to smoke weed daily for the past two years. Three or four times a day. I was never sober and afraid of socializing with anyone. All I did was play smash (sill a huge fan btw) and chief all night. Recently, I decided enough was enough. I hated moving no where in my life and just wanted a new start. I moved away from my old environment and isolated myself from weed. The first two days were fine, besides for some night sweats. The following three days were accompanied by some insane mood swings which i hated. And there were nightmares but trust me you can get through them and still have a good day. I think I’m making it through slowly but surely. 

I have five interviews this week and could not be more thankful for becoming sober. Not gonna quit, just gonna quit until I’m successful enough to start again. Guys, I feel like I have superpowers. My memory and ability to respond to others hasn’t felt this good in years. I’m much more confident in myself and I enjoy sobriety as a new state of mind. I know some of you are like me, you want to quit because progress isn’t being made and you’re not sure if becoming sober will help at all either. Let me tell you IT DOES.

I also turned down a spliff (my old favorite) at a backyard gathering with my friends on that day, which I was proud of. 

So I figured maybe I just happened to previously be smoking less than others I’ve read about here, or maybe I just got lucky or something, and got through the withdrawal process more quickly than it normally takes. I wasn’t gonna argue with the good results either way haha. 

But it turned out not to be the case. I tried to hit the ground running today and get back on the horse for my job search and other things I’m working on in my life. 

But today was/is a struggle. I had a partially productive hour or so in the morning, but lost focus and generally felt very depressed and lacking direction after that. It was very hard to work on stuff, even making myself lunch. The brain fog is real. 

Ultimately I know now that I still have a long road in front of me in terms of feeling normal again. But it’s ok. I was indeed bummed, but now I know not to get ahead of myself. 

There will be more good days and bad days both before I make it through this process. And I will make it through. Because I am still determined.

I found myself moving from a place where I had well established social support and great friends into the intense, anxiety-provoking life of a grad student with very little opportunity to meet people and forge new connections. I found myself using cannabis more and more to stymie my anxiety, help me sleep, and honestly just fill the hours.

I love my field and I am getting close to what I've wanted to do professionally for a long long time. I always knew that drug use was not compatible with my personal and professional values but I kept putting off quitting and didn't really suffer any consequences until an exciting position (federal govt.) came up out of the blue that I'm now realizing I may need to pass on due to my cannabis use over the past year. I don't want to use anymore. I've been completely clean for 15 days now-- and had cut down  from daily usage at the start of the pandemic to only 1-2 times/week come March 2021. I've opened up to my various support networks (family, peers, lab mentor) about my struggles, thrown out all of my paraphernalia, and finally have the momentum to seek out professional help for my anxiety. 

I guess where my fear remains is just how to fill my hours, especially with the summer coming and my course load dropping substantially-- meaning I'll have more leisure time I would have previously filled by smoking.

All of these things gave me and my now wife A LOT of anxiety. 

How did I quit: in Aug 2020 i learned I was having a baby. Until Dec 2020 i made the decision I want to be a sober and present dad. I’m not going to lie, when I ran out i panicked because I didn’t know who I was without the weed.

The last years I have struggled with trying to quit because weed only brings me down and makes me forget about the difficult things in life.

I know tomorrow is going to be tough but I have to start trusting my own advice. Stop listening to the addiction and start listening to reason. Every time I smoke I become boring and lose my goals and ambitions. I don’t want to hang out with friends and every menial task of cleaning or working becomes unimportant or to hard to do.

I started smoking about 3 years ago. And at the beginning it was something new and interesting, i would get high with my friends, and have a great time.Later on i started smoking alone, it was fun for short time.

But my life started changing, girl i loved went to another man, i separated  with many  friends.

And weed become perfect coping tool.I was sad, alone, depressed.Started smoking weed not to just get high, but run away from my problems, I didn't want to face my emotions, i just buried them.

Started ignoring my few friends that i had ,even my parents, because i just wanted to smoke.I was making excuses that i have to work, but in reality i just wanted to get high.

nearly everyday, every evening....

I became a spectator in my life, started even to forget who i was. I became resentful and bitter, about my life and myself.

No more...

I was a senior in high school and it changed my life. It opened social doors and broke down mental blocks. It was just on weekends for the first few months, but it became daily in the summer after I finished High School. It's hard to say exactly when the positives of using weed were overtaken by the negatives, but it was probably a lot earlier than I realized.

I recall that about two years after starting weed, I was already trying to quit. I remember I had not used any in some time (maybe a month?) and I relapsed at a New Years Eve party. I was drunk when I did it, so i ended up getting the spins and puking. There were so many other failed quit attempts over the years, but I do remember that first.

I was pulled back in every time and got right back to the daily weed life like an old pair of shoes. In the big picture, I felt like I was doing pretty good. Many of the people in the orbit of my social circle were getting into much heavier drugs. People around me were overdosing on hard drugs. I knew alcoholics that were a tornado of collection agency calls, anger issues, and employment troubles. I was functional and cruising forward through life in an abusive love hate relationship with weed. And that's where I stayed though my 20's and 30's.

Over those 2 decades, weed was getting more and more popular and accepted in our culture and society. The product was always improving too starting with seedy brick, then kind, then BC, then homegrown from friends. This gave me a lot of confidence and affirmation that what I was doing was pretty normal. Anytime I would think ""maybe the weed is an issue for me?"", I would look around and see that it seemed fine for everyone else involved. I was just one person in a secret society of people living an enhanced version of life.

Then it became available medically in my state. I used a persistent knee pain and anxiety to get a medical recommendation. Now it was my medicine and I was choosing different strains to try see what worked better or worse. It was also getting a lot more powerful than the random weed I had used previously. Next it was recreational and the new more powerful formats were coming online.

Specifically pens made it WAY too easy and convenient. All the ceremony involved in toking was out the window. It was something you could take a pull from in a bathroom at a restaurant or walking home from work. It seemed that daily I would tell myself I needed a break, but a couple hours later find myself baked out of my gourd, binging internet, and halfway through a package of oreo double stuff. I started to crack.

My physical health had taken a toll from all the sugar and salt snacks and it was showing in my bloodwork. I have always been a very active person even as a daily toker. Biking to work, hiking on weekends, snowboarding, even some running over the years. But all that movement could not hold back the tide of issues from high eating binges.

In this era, I was working from home on Fridays. That quickly became a wake and bake day with pen all day long. It was on one of those days in August 2018 that I had enough. I recalled something about a subreddit to help people getting away from weed. I made a new reddit account and posted my reasons for wanting to quit.



Posting, reading, and commenting here was cathartic and I was on a roll. As we are all aware it was not easy, but I finally felt that I had found some positive momentum. The support and structure from /r/leaves made all the difference compared to my countless previous quit attempts over the years. I was feeling so free and empowered and it really shows in all of my posts and comments here. I made it to 6 months by Feb 2019 and then relapsed for no real reason at all.

I was back to everyday for a couple weeks and then stopped. I got pulled back in a couple of times at concerts, but they were one off times. And then by July 2019 I really fell off the wagon for 3 months and was back to the daily rut. I could not believe it. How could the same person that made so much progress from quitting suddenly be trapped back in the daily cycle of regret and haze? I was able to get back up and dust myself off in late September 2019.



I cruised through another 6 months away from weed more confident and proud than ever. I spent a ton of time here trying to help others and stay focused on my quit. Then in mid March, covid had me working from home full time. I guess I didn't really need an excuse, we never do. I had cracked right at 6 months again and was having regrets everyday that I used. On top of all the anxiety from covid, this was the last thing I needed and I knew it. But still I found myself stuck in the same damn ditch again. Everyday I said I would stop and 10 minutes later I was as high, anxious, and riddled with regret. But I knew I had to get back up. I checked in here again and started the process that has become familiar.


That day was now a year ago. This is a far better feeling than I even hoped it would be. Every time weed pops into my head I have a huge feeling of relief. I am so grateful that I don't have to deal with that monkey and all his bullshit today.

One of my friends who is a lifetime cigarette and weed smoker got admitted to the hospital for asthma and bronchitis this week and will be there for several days. That was eye-opening for me in a way I did not expect - I felt a wave of terror wash over me as fears about my own lungs rose up.  

The worst part is, my brain still keeps telling me I want to smoke.  How is it possible that half my brain is woefully regretting every bit of damage I've done to my lungs and the other half is like, ""yeah, but, wouldn't you also like a smoke?""  No, I would not like a smoke, I would like to not die from lung damage.

Last time I tried to post here I was high and a mod didn't accept my post. I get that and it makes perfect sense. It's almost like a paradox. When I'm high I want to quit and when I'm sober I want to believe it's okay to have a smoke here and there.

Except it isn't. I know that flushing weed down the toilet is a bit dramatic and it doesn't mean I'm not going to relapse...But it was something I felt the need to do and look at it.

I started smoking weed in 2012-2013, almost 8 to 9 years since I had my first joint.

Since then, I stopped a few times...some with ""success"" I'd say and others not so successful.

&#x200B;

I'll draw a timeline to make it clearer.

&#x200B;

**1.** **2012 - 2013: So it began.**

I had my first joint and slowly started to smoke every weekend to finally smoke everyday.

&#x200B;

**2. 2013 - Dec/2017: When there was not a single day that I wasn't high.**

Daily smoker, from the moment I woke up I'd hit the bong and smoke some joints all the way through the end of the day, until I sleep.

However, through out 2017 I started to question myself about my use and its effects on me.

&#x200B;

**3. Jan/2017 - May/2017: When I stopped for the first time.**

At the end of 2017 I decided it was time to quit and I managed to stay sober for about 4 months. The first 2 or 3 days were the toughest. After that, my life felt so much better in many aspects. So Why did I relapse?

After about 3-4 months sober, I figured I had managed my addiction so I could smoke a joint or two at a friend's barbecue.

Little did I know that a few months later I'd be back to be a daily user.

&#x200B;

**4. May/2017 - Dec/2017: Back to daily smoking.**

That's it. I didn't manage to get a way around my addiction when I relapsed for the first time.

&#x200B;

**5. Jan/2018 - Jun/2020: My biggest victory yet.**

After what I've experienced relapsing and feeling like I didn't deserved another chance because I was ""weak"", I had a purpose of getting into med school and then it clicked to me. 

It clicked to me that weed couldn't have its space in my life anymore if I did want to get in to a good med school.

It felt the easiest thing to do because I had a clear purpose in my mind that I couldn't perform or study at my best if I was smoking weed.

&#x200B;

**6. Jun/2020 - Yesterday: My worst relapse so far.**

After the covid pandemic came, my classes stopped and I saw myself not studying or doing anything productive. I found myself lonely and without a purpose. Just like that, it didn't take long for me to get back to smoking.

I did stop for a few months at the end of 2020 but still I got back to smoking in 2021. 

I started my online business with a friend and now we have a company that's been doing really good. 

Financially and professionally speaking, everything is great. But personally? Nah, I've been smoking daily to cope with the stress that works brings me and it doesn't feel like purpose feeling kind of work.

I did want to become a doctor, but now that I'm making a good amount of money that's out of question. For now at least.

Even tho I'm not finding a purpose again just yet - a life purpose - I do know that getting high to get by is only hurting me in many aspects.

I don't take care of myself. I don't work out anymore, I'm not eating healthy anymore and I don't seem to care much about friends or family when I'm high.

So yeah, yesterday I flushed all down the toilet because I'm done. That's enough. I can't and won't take it anymore. 

Even tho I'm saying that, I'm scared AS F\*CK because I know it's an addiction and there are a lot of things that still makes me like weed.

I do think it's important to list them here because these things are the ones that pull me back down every other time.

\- Good weed. Where I live I never could smoke a good strain of weed because is SO MUCH expensive. Now that I have money and can smoke the good stuff it makes even harder to stop.

\- Sex. This one may seem lame as f\*ck  but it's the truth. When I do have sex with a girl that I like, I have the need to perform a lot so she can enjoy the sex just as me. However, when I'm on weed I can last sooooo much more in bed. I feel invincible. And when I'm sober I just don't last that much and feel like shit. And I don't to be a weed slave so I can be confident when I have sex. This one really is a big worry for me.

\- Friends. I live with 2 good friends that work with me at my business. One of them is a daily smoker and we just signed the rent deal so yeah, moving out is out of question. Honestly? Sometimes I'd like to have the option to smoke a joint once a month or something like that, but we know that's not possible. That's why it's called an addiction.

&#x200B;

**7. Today - ???: Day one, again.**

And there's today. I know it's going to hurt and be hard. It already is. I also do have a date with a beautiful girl tonight and I want to be present, sober. Am i going to worry about my performance in bed without weed? I might. But I need to learn how to live a pleasant life without being hostage of a substance.

&#x200B;

That's it. I just needed to get all of this out of my chest. I do feel better just by writing this out. I'm so grateful that I found this sub, I'm planning to stick around and make this my new daily habit.

I'll see you tomorrow, wish me luck!",16,2

I came to the conclusion that it really only helped me tolerate being in an emotionally abusive relationship. Before I met my ex-boyfriend over 4 years ago, I didn’t care about smoking pot. I did it once in awhile in college but I didn’t like it that much cause it burned my throat. My ex was(is) a heavy user. Smokes everyday. Before we lived together I’d only smoke when we would see each other and sometimes that was once a month (we went to different colleges a couple hours apart). Then we moved in with each other and I started to use more. Then some tough things started to happen and we would both use it to self medicate. There was a point where we were both unemployed and all we cared about was getting high, eating and playing video games. My personality was being a pot head.

Luckily I started to go to therapy to deal with my issues. I still smoked a lot but I was also working and going to school to get my masters. I was a heavy user for about 2 years straight. Then I started to get panic attacks. Every time I would get high and eat something I would get anxious thinking I couldn’t swallow properly. It just got weird. So I started to cut down and take month long breaks. Those t-breaks themselves helped tremendously. Then in October 2020, me and my ex broke up. After he moved out, I haven’t smoked since. 

After getting out of an abusive relationship and not smoking, life has been better. Issues are more manageable. I still get craving from time to time but they go away eventually. I’ve also saved so much $$$. I remember thinking 2 years ago that I couldn’t live life without weed. And here I am, living life without it and I intend to keep it that way.",12,0

Just want you to know I find this sub to be the most helpful thing in quitting this drug. I figured I would start participating a bit more and share where I'm at right now.

Didn't touch weed since last Thursday, it's the third time I attempt to quit since the start of the pandemic, been a daily smoker (every night I went to bed high) for over 3 years. I couldn't live without weed very long for my first 2 attempts, longest I've been without it was a month or so. This time I'm not touching this ever again.

I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last October, at 35 y/o... I'm quite sure the munchies I got from weed, destroying entire bags of chips and candy at night is responsible for this. I didn't notice until I started to feel weird and have blurred vision. Using the gf's kit, I found out my blood glucose levels were insanely off the charts. The kind of ""off the charts"" that caused the meter to simply show ""HI"". Let me tell you I wasn't too proud to go see a doctor for this. Luckily, I'm able to control it with some meds and paying attention to my carb intake, so it should not affect me too much for the rest of my life and it's even possible to reverse this, at least partially.

What doesn't help at all is that my BMI is 38.5 and I probably gained 40-50 lbs since I started blazing entire bowls of high-THC Indica every night, so I'm not in a good place right now. I'm able to get my first dose of COVID vaccine sooner (appt. this Friday) because of these conditions, so I guess there's that.

It's even more damning that when I was younger, I enjoyed running, cycling and team sports a lot and was pretty fit. Now I feel like a fat ass. However, the will to change is present and I'm gonna start with controlling food intake, going on long walks, start running again etc. to shed pounds, I hope. I realized there's no point in being ashamed of what you are, it doesn't help. Easier said than done, I know!

I took the week off to be free from the stress of work to deal with withdrawal. Honestly so far it's been ok, except the damn night sweats, insomnia and screwed-up digestion.

Reconnecting with past hobbies will definitely help. Only thing I was doing while high is watching series sitting at my computer, not even remembering most of the plot sometimes. I'm a casual PC gamer with a powerful machine I bought in 2018 and weed definitely impeded my capacity to enjoy it.

We all have our struggles, but they're so much easier to overcome with communities like this, where you can feel like you're not alone.

My question is about resin hits.

I never imagined I’d feel excited about my sober clock hitting 30 days. I guess part of my mind gamified it, which makes sense considering how much of a sucker I am for score systems in gaming. 

For those wondering if today’s the day to stop, I’m telling you it’s soooo much fun. Like legitimately, I can watch TV comedy now and get the jokes much faster, and laugh even harder, while sober. I’m not gonna lie it sucks for the first few days to a week.

If you’re struggling taking the first step, here’s what I suggest you do. Every time you feel like hitting a bong or rolling a J today, just quickly take a read of a post here first. Every time you want to get high today, challenge yourself to do 15 push-ups instead. Fill that brain space and short term focus with something before thoughts of wanting to get high come forward. 

PS it also helps to throw away any weed material or up the stakes. I personally gave my most trusted friend 90% of my savings. Straight venmo’d it to them. I told them that if I get high, they should take $10 from it for each time I do. Instead of $10, let that person take 2% for each time you get high. The financial stakes, as well as not wanting to see my friend’s smug face as I fail on my umpteenth commitment of quitting, motivate me just enough.

Ive discovered so much of this process really is self care, and deep introspection. I’ve really focused on understanding my psychology as a person, accepting the goods and bads of what makes me brain tick and perform. I recommend taking the same time to understand what internal and external triggers push you towards weed. If you’ve smoked as long as I have (weekly from ages 15-17, daily from 17-20), then marijuana is a reflex for you, much like swatting a fly with your hand. 

Seriously. I’m so happy right now. And I’m a person who is type A, I’ve been killing it at a top college in the US, have had prestigious internships and a stacked resume, all while smoking and drinking almost everyday. I thought things wouldn’t be much different sober. My external life hasn’t changed yet. But I feel better as a human. I’m only 20 about to graduate, and without weed I feel like I’m really able to experience the pains and joys of daily life without having to blunt either.

If you’re young, I’m especially telling you to drop it and be as happy as me. Because the real emotions of joys and pains we blunt with marijuana are what we, the youngest generation, need to truly grow as humans. Just in the past month, I’ve experienced personal development and maturity that should have began years ago, but was delayed by my reflex of smoking.

If anyone needs a place to start, feel free to message me. We can start you staying sober today, or tomorrow. Whenever you want to get high, message me instead and let’s chat.

After smoking daily (every evening) for 11 years straight, I never thought I'd stop.

I've quit cigs and the white powder much, much easier than this - I think weeds more difficult because it doesn't have the same blatant negativity of other substances...it's more nefarious and creeps up over years and years.

If I can do it, you can too. 

The 3 days is very relevant to those of you at the start of your journey.

Basically, the first week or 2, you're counting down the hours. Counting down the days - just one more hour without it. Just one more day without it.

Eventually, you kinda forget - I meant to log in to my quit app the other day to check my timer, and I basically forgot.

The point I'm making with that really, is the longer you go - the easier it becomes. At first it might possess your thoughts every hour or every day, but eventually, you're counting down the weeks and then just not thinking about it.

Won't say I'm fully ""healed"" yet - but things are drastically improved

I certainly feel that I have a better self image after quitting, and I’m glad that I’m not breaking the law, but I never experienced the night and day differences which a lot of posters on here seem to have had. 
However, even if the benefits to sobriety may not be obvious, they are there. Don’t be discouraged if you quit, only to find that your life hasn’t changed one hundred percent.",483,0

T11 years later, I've been addicted to several different substances and often at the same time. Ive stopped all of them. Pot was always that one thing I was gonna do forever.  I remember the first time I smoked pot like it was yesterday. I was 16 and stole some of my parents pot. Ever since then I've pretty much been smoking as much as I can as often as I can. So, I've pretty much wasted the past 11 years of my life and honestly have come along way. But this damn cannabis. Ive stopped hard drugs. But cannabis has a hold of me. My lungs are fucked. I weeze and can hardly breathe sometimes. I sit up to fast and have to catch my breathe. Ive done alot of piece of shit things and used cannabis to ignore all my problems. .  Haven't been clean from pot for more than 24 hours other than when I went to jail a couple years ago for 2 weeks. I just wanna be happy healthy and sober. I have so much guilt about the past 11 years. I don't even have my own daughter. My dad and his wife have her because I wasn't able to provide for her. So i made sure to get her somewhere she'd have everything she'd ever ask for. I feel like human garbage. I first went to juvie at 16 for 8 break and entering and 8 theft of property. Because I was trying to get money to buy more pot. Ive lived most my life lying and trying to get money in unhonest ways just to sit around and smoke pot and then be depressed when I don't have any.

I was on the way back and I heard sage brush rustling about 15 feet behind me and I turned around and saw nothing but I definitely heard something loud and It freaked me out enough that i immediately called my friend. After that I had a serious sense of dread and the feeling I was being watched. I started walking and not even 30 seconds after that a huge mountain lion came out of the brush and charged me until it was about 30 feet away. I was literally stuck in place holding my switch blade screaming oh my god into my phone. After I screamed at the top of my lungs it took off back into the brush but its pitch black and I cant see anything. I began crying pretty much immediately and mustered the courage to continue walking down the steep ass trail backwards. I was so afraid I started hallucinating that I was being surrounded by coyotes  and that I was hearing peoples footsteps behind me. I know it stalked me for a while outside my range of vision but I could occasionally hear it. After I got to a huge clearing with no brush I started to calm down and I turned around to walk normally and then I sped up even faster to the bottom. After I got to the bottom I swore to never go hiking at night or without a gun. After that much emotional stress I really want a bowl just to sleep and ik my stepdad has wax but f that I won't do it.,2,0

I only recognized my addiction less than a year ago. There was always an excuse I gave myself. (Rough childhood, stress, helps me sleep, helps me relax, helps me eat, etc.) I didn't realize that smoking before bed wasn't helping my sleep, or my stress, or my diet; it was the cause.

I want to say there was some miracle tool I used to quit, but there wasn't. Truth is, I got so stressed that I just couldn't do it anymore. So I spent the first three days getting very little sleep and eating very little. I drank bottles of Ensure for nutrients, since food tasted like ash. I stayed awake until I couldn't. It wasn't great, but it was much easier than I thought it would be.

A month later, here I am. Sleeping well, my apartment doesn't smell, and most importantly, I eat. A lot. I jog, not to look better, but to feel better. I am in control. The stress is ongoing, but addiction is no longer a part of that. And that's big for me.",12,0

I keep saying tomorrow and then tomorrow, tomorrow... and so on. 

I've been in recovery from alcohol and meth for 4 years, but before that I smoked sooo much weed daily since I was 18, and I'm almost 30 now. I didn't list being in recovery from weed because even though I was sober from it, I never considered it ""my problem"". 

During the pandemic I was forced to be so isolated. The family I work for as a nanny basically gave me an ultimatum to move in with them at the start of the virus because they were so paranoid. And as a result, I was lonely, went through a breakup, and my best and basically only friend here moved back to her home state. Had 2 therapists quit on me and stopped going to my AA meetings. What was supposed to be 3 months of being there turned into a year and I've been smoking weed since August to cope with my feelings of being in a new city and anxious. Because weed doesn't seem as quickly destructive as alcohol or meth I'm able to justify it and my addict convinces me that it helps rather than harm me. 

However,  it has gotten to the point that if I am not constantly vaping weed every 20 minutes, I feel hella anxious and sick. Sick like dry heaving, nauseous. I start to get withdrawals now, like with stronger drugs I did. However having a tolerance built up with weed, isn't like other drugs and now when I'm high, it's like music doesnt even sound good and food doesnt even taste good everything is still bland. But without weed, music sounds like nothing and food is unbearable. Which makes me soo scared to quit. 

My life didn't feel so great or anything when I was sober and I still felt anxious and out of control, but at least I had some energy, some appetite and some kind of consciousness rather than this overwhelming apathetic unrest. Weed makes me overthink everything from going to the grocery store to calling my mom and thus am a weird sheltered hermit who would rather be high and do nothing than literally anything because I am in my head and that makes me kind of sad and disgusted with myself but I feel so far gone that like what's the point? Is there life after 30 lol. I feel like such a waste of a person. :(

I went on a week vacation with the family I nanny about a month and a half ago, brought no vapes, edibles, tinctures, whatever I use. And it was hard the first day but then I had so much fun with them and energy and drive I couldn't believe it. But when we got bsck I found a cart, told myself I would just smoke for a day and here we are. I feel so far from that place now though, I'm only comfortable when first high and numb. I am irritated with the kids I watch, who I love so much. I quit going to all other classes/hobbies/passions of mine when smoking and I seriously avoid everything everyday....and yet I am scared to be without this crutch and excuse not to face life.

Plus 

I threw out a bag of all my weed stuff near but not that near to a homeless encampment about a week ago but I just went back the next day and picked it up. I have this giant excuse that I don't want to throw away what I have right now and need to give it to someone who would use it or it's a waste:
4 different weed vape batteries,
2 different spray tinctures unused,
5 mostly But not all the way used vape cartridges
Uneaten pack of gummies and 2 joints

I feel so strongly like I need to go offer it to a homeless person and not waste it!!!!! Ughhh I don't want to waste it so badly. But at the same time, I don't have it in my high, weirdo ass to go driving around tonight looking for someone, plus if I don't stop I'm going to waste so much more money. I spend like hundreds if not close to $ 1000 a month on weed. And obviously last time I threw it out my car, hoping someone would pick it up that didn't work.

I think I have to go throw it all in the dumpster right now. I draw the line at digging through garbage and I'm so sorry homeless ppl who might have liked these weed things, ( I live in a big city where weed is legal  BTW so this wouldn't be weird to do I don't think lol) I just know if I hold on to this overnight I will smoke tomorrow and then for the rest of the week and then buy more. 

Omg I'm gonna cry, weed is my best friend right now and the only one who makes me feel not alone for the last 9 months. But I have to do this. I want so much more out of life than to be a hideaway stoner. I've been reading your posts and inspired. Please please please let this be the right decision. I'm about to have one last post and go to the dumpster with all the goods. I've been thinking about this for so long, since I started again. It's going to be so hard but I will be living again, not just existing.

After almost 17 years and nearly half my life of increasing use and eventually abuse, on 11/9/20 I decided to quit. At the time I wasn’t sure if I wanted to quit for good but my using was at such an extreme level that I knew I needed a break (and deep down I knew I needed to quit). Two weeks into quitting I tried a Marijuana Anonymous meeting on Zoom and I knew I had found my people.

I resisted 12 step programs for years due to the higher power stuff. To be honest it’s still a bit of a struggle for me but I’ve managed to have great success in the program. I’ve been working the steps with a sponsor since the one month mark and my behavior and self esteem has improved so, so much as a direct result.

My life is immeasurably better sober. Thanks to sobriety/recovery, as well as finally getting treatment for my mental health issues, I can say that today is the happiest I have ever been. My work life has improved, my relationships have improved (most of all with myself), and my quality of life has improved. I don’t have memory problems. I don’t forget what I’m saying halfway through a sentence. I brush my teeth before bed now. I clean up after myself and cook more. I’ve saved hundreds if not thousands of dollars. And best of all I have a sense of accomplishment and internal integrity knowing that I’m starting to live up to my potential.

Trust me when I say that if I can do, so can you. I tried to control my addiction for so long and the more I tried, the worse it got. I had to be high constantly. I couldn’t enjoy anything without a bowl or my vape pen. I brought it on planes, in movie theaters, to family events - everywhere, thinking that I was enhancing my experiences when all the while I was detracting from them. I didn’t think I could have fun without being stoned. I was dead wrong. I now have a blast 100% sober. I can experience joy, act silly, chill on the couch, BE BORED, and clean my apartment without substances.

For those of you who are struggling, hang in there. It wasn’t easy for me at first. The first month was pretty rough (especially when the emotions I had been suppressing came flooding in). But little by little life got better and I was able to manage my emotions and moods. If you’re struggling, be gentle with yourself. Know that it does get better. We’re all on our own timeline and there are lots of resources to help with sobriety (I’m just sharing what has worked for me).

Sending love to all of you!",5,0

Here’s what happened...,"If the title alone wasn’t a clue... yes I relapsed. Otherwise I wouldn’t be here. However, it’s a testament to how long quitting can take and the ups and downs of my relationship with weed. But 15 years ago my usage had gone from purely recreational and sporadic to constant. Attempts to quit on my own weren’t working and I had a new job in the security industry and needed to clean up my act. So I signed up for hypnosis. 

First off, my assumptions about being hypnotized were incredibly cliche: it’s a circus trick/ get a guy to believe he’s a chicken etc. The information session with the hypo therapist was excellent at dispelling my juvenile and uninformed opinions. We proceeded to meet every fortnight for 12 sessions in total. 

I guess the best way to describe it was .. it’s like guided meditation, but with magic disco lights in your head. 

The therapists room was a windowless office, decorated very cozy, like a study. There was a basket of blankets and I was encouraged to drape one over myself each session. He’d dim the lights and then fit a visor over my head and instruct me to close my eyes. This visor had red lights configured in concentric circles, that would pulse in different rhythms during the session. With my eyes closed, the lights would still register on my closed lids, the way you can still sense a bright light flashing in your face even with your eyes closed. He’d then switch to a monotone voice- virtually no inflection- and start a guided meditation... very similar to the stuff you get on apps now. We’d start by picturing me descending on an escalator... down, down...then a head to toe body scan where he’d ask me clench/ tense a body part then release. Some body parts were weird/ hard to do (my ears ?? Dude what?? Clench my ears ??) but by this point, I’m just going with it. The disco lights are pulsing against my eye lids, but I’m not “out” yet. 

And then, somewhere around this mark the therapist started the specific topic for the week— perhaps about avoiding triggers, or healthy habits, or self acceptance. And every session?... I’d get as far as hearing the first three sentences of the topic and then I’d just...... go away. 

I was out. 100%. I’d come to 45 minutes later, hearing the phrase “.... on the count of 3...2...1....and we’re back.” I felt insanely relaxed and refreshed. And I had no idea what had happened in the interim. I’d take off the visor, yawn, blink....

The therapist would give me the recorded CD of the session. My homework was to listen to the same session each day (sans disco light visor). I would never go out like I did at the clinic, but I’d hear the positive things/ validations/ the therapist had said during the session. I did drift in and out, like a meditation..... the guy’s voice was ridiculously soothing. 

Did it help / work?  Yes. And no. 

It worked as long as I scrupulously listened to the CDs. As soon as I didn’t, I didn’t seem to be able to independently retrieve the coping skills. But it did keep me clean for 2 years. 

I never transferred the CDs to new technology. They’re in the basement, somewhere. I’m going to retrieve them just to see how they work 15 years on.

I noticed myself towards the end of smoking feeling like if I could just find something stronger to really get me where I was going that would be even better. Started doing hot knives and took myself on the type of trip I have not been on in years, that’s what really brought me to my knees and helped me get rid of everything. Part of me still thought, I want to get even higher than that next time. 

Mostly I’m nervous if they ever found out I was there for weed they would think I’m an idiot for feeling like I should belong. Very clearly internal dialogue being projected onto the whole of NA, possibly as an excuse not to go? I’m not entirely sure why. 

Anyone else struggling with the same feelings or thoughts?

This post is basically as the tittle reads. I have started journaling my feelings, and today I decided to write about why I like smoking weed/why I started smoking weed to begin with. 

I realized that I liked smoking weed for 3 reasons...

1) I was a better version of myself/I liked the version of me smoking better. 

2) It chilled me out/made me feel cool. 

3) I liked that weed was easily accessible. Meaning that it was discreet and I could smoke carts instead of letting everyone know I was smoking weed/actual herb. 

Once I found the reasons why I liked smoking, I then wrote about why it was bad for me/ why I felt like that. 

1) why I like smoking weed:  I was a better version of myself/I liked the version of me smoking better.

1a) why it’s bad for me: Even though I felt like I am my better self, it really is not my better self. It is a self that is only influenced by drugs/I am only that person when I’m on drugs. Therefore, you are never experiencing your true self. 

1b) why i feel like this: I feel like this because I have not given myself the time to get to know the real me/spend time with myself. I don’t need friends that want to smoke, I need myself. 

2) why I like smoking weed: It chilled me out/made me feel cool. 

2a) why it’s bad for me: I should smoke because it’s honestly bad. Weed has been genetically modified like everything else and is no longer the  natural plant it was. This is a bad coping mechanism because I am not really dealing with my problems. 

2b) why I feel like this: it does not chill me out/make me feel good. I am only avoiding my feelings. I need to deal with things instead of depending on weed to deal with them for me. 

3) why I like smoking weed: I liked that weed was easily accessible. Meaning that it was discreet and I could smoke carts instead of letting everyone know I was smoking weed/actual herb. 

3a) why it’s bad for me: it’s bad for me because it’s just draining my money long term/I’m not spending money on things I want anymore. I’m spending money on things I am DEPENDENT on. 

3b) why I feel like this: I feel like this because all my money is being spend on useless drugs. Use the drug to explore the world, but not abuse it. You need to still live life, not live for smoking/live to smoke. That’s dumb. 

After I found out why I liked smoking weed, I wrote on why I even turned to weed to begin with. I honestly wanted to find the root of my source. 
So I wrote:

I turned to weed because I was tired of letting [my ex] walk all over me. I let all the bad feelings win instead of fighting. I gave up. Instead of taking life lessons and actually incorporating them into real life. To win anything, we need to not give up/believe in ourself. I didn’t do that. I wanted weed to be my friend/to help me cry. Instead, I got consumed by that happy feeling weed gave me “being chilled out.” I didn’t deL with things. I let weed deal with them for me. I have been playing the victim, but I am the only one responsible for having let weed get the best of me. Take control of your life again. Don’t live for weed. Don’t let the best part of your day be having smoked a blunt/weed. That is not the best part/should not be someone’s best part.

I think I had a breakthrough with my feelings today. This outlet of writing my feelings/exploring my feelings/the root of my feelings really really really helps!!",14,0

1127,2021-05-09 17:36:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/n8o893/i_quit_that_toxic_relationship/,I quit that toxic relationship,"Weed has been a part of my life for many years. At first I tried it as a teenager in the summer holidays with my cousin and her friends and I had good laughs! I liked that dizziness and felt funnier and more confident. I enjoyed doing something forbidden but in a friendly environment, in warm summer nights or at the beach and it was so special, as it was clearly linked to that time of the year when I visited my family, my cousin and had a supply I trusted in. 

After I started studying,  smoked  on campus, with my friends and it became a part of celebrating (whatever there was to celebrate, which often happened to be simply the fact that we met). I never owned it at that time but was attached to people that did and had a good time.
Then, my granddad passed away and I was devastated but not capable of dealing with that loss and my emotions. I found a new friend in the neighborhood and he became my supply. I thought for a long time that he helped me to deal with the loss but that’s not the case.

I started using it more frequently, mostly on a daily basis and I started to become frustrated about the frequency, the urge I felt to smoke and that I was not capable of quitting. I would leave it for a few days to reassure myself that I was capable of quitting only to start again and to feel bad because I was high most days of a month after month and year after year. Sometimes I started to deconstruct and let myself think that I was feeling bad only because society made it something bad. Other times I took this as an explanation for the paranoia and the discomfort I felt. 

I compare it to a toxic relationship because of all the emotional harm I went through, remembering the beautiful situations, how romantic smoking had been before it became the routine that hooked me and made me feel miserable most of the time - although I didn’t want to realize it. I wanted it to be fun and relaxing, ignored that my heart was beating too fast, or that I was afraid almost every night because I had the impression that I had stopped breathing. For me it is so hard to understand why I went through that major discomfort over and over again and again. It might be not to acknowledge my boundaries or the yearning for the good old days.

I went through that vicious cycle over and over again until 11 weeks ago. That is by far the longest time I have been sober since almost ten years. I am so glad!!!! 

It has been so often that I had the intention to leave it. I did for several weeks, just to fall again into the trap of thinking that I could control it and use it only occasionally. It never ever worked. 

I started running in February and one day, sitting on the sofa and smoking I realized a feeling of shrinking. I felt as if my lungs were shrinking and I felt so bad as I already reduced the frequency of smoking and running made me feel so good, strong and wide. It is as if that bodily experience made me realize, how bad smoking weed really felt for me and how wholesome I could start to feel if I spend more time outdoors, running or walking but filling my lungs with fresh air, moving and not restricting myself with that substitute for everything.",12,0

I’m starting a new grad program in the fall and I know that there is no way I can stay motivated if I continue to smoke weed regularly. Like another poster said, I feel like a spectator in my own life. I keep waiting for my life to “go” but I’m the only one who can make it go. 

I didn’t start smoking right away after I quit drinking, so I do know what it’s like to be 100% clean, and my life was stellar during that period. So why do l like weed if my life was better before? This is the question probably everyone here has asked themselves. 2020 was a completely weed filled year, like nearly all day every day. Everything went to zoom and I was sipping on my vape literally all day. Delivery services made it so easy to never be out. 

All the while I’m thinking, at least I’m not drinking. Alcoholism killed my mom and put me in the hospital several times- I had pancreatitis at 24. Weed felt harmless in comparison to something that was literally going to kill me within a short time if I didn’t stop. But that’s the thing I’ve learned about weed, the “bottom” isn’t chance of an early death, but it may as well be. I quit booze so I would LIVE and I’m not living. Last night I had the craziest dreams but I woke up feeling like I can do this.

for reference, i'm 20F. started smoking at 14, daily smoker since 18. second time attempting sobriety but it definitely feels way different than last year when i went 6 months. as hard as it gets, i know weed will never be worth it, it'll always be a never ending loop of stagnancy and putting my life on hold. putting an end to the vicious cycle now and saying yes to life! i hope you all can find the courage to do the same; it is absolutely worth it :)

benefits would be that we can control our dreams, meaning we can change a nightmare into something beautiful. i also think lucid dreaming is an amazing way to reflect and heal, which would help us on the journey of recovery.
besides, our dreams are already very vivid and stable at the moment, something that lucid dreamers aspire to achieve. maybe we should take advantage of that and turn it into a positive thing.
i achieved it once and it was awesome but i kinda stopped the practice after, probably because of smoking.

But it has been a hard journey so far. I know it’s not typical to have lingering withdrawals after a few weeks of quitting, but my psychological withdrawal has been a long process to work through. It is getting better though if I compare my mental state to 6 months ago.

My mental health has been getting better day by day and very slowly- the lack of motivation, anxiety, sleep issues, etc. I never had cravings to use again because I’m determined to stay sober, but I did have a couple of using dreams recently.

Anyways, I just wanted to check in and share my progress. I know this isn’t a typical “I feel great!” kind of post. But it’s my honest journey, and I know there might be a few others that can benefit from knowing they are not alone in not feeling too good several months into their sobriety.

I have followed this sub 
on the fringe like many others and feel like returning the favor you all gave me. 

My story:

Leaves entered my life in 8th grade and I used daily up until last week. I was the jock in high school and did not think cannabis was a problem because my performance was exceptional. I came in 2nd in the state finals in the 2 mile my junior year.

Next up was college and this was my first rude awakening to how much damage cannabis, and in my case alcohol, does to a person. I was in the biggest frat on campus, partied more than I studied and was always the life of the party. When the frat had a party at the house, who do you think was on stage with the band doing wild shit and whipping up a “good” frenzy? You guessed it, that was me.


After 3 years I knew I needed a change of scenery and I transferred to another university in a state where cannabis was legal. I was not aware how cannabis being legal would affect my relationship with cannabis, but it did. All of a sudden my subconscious decided because it is legal it is now ok to consume cannabis as you please. I can’t get arrested for it! This was not a wise move. As you all know, cannabis induces all sorts of subconscious doubts and fears that prevent the user from going outside and socializing with everyone else. I was the same and by the time I graduated I realized the opportunity I just missed: to build lasting relationships with like minded people.


I thought, “oh well, I’ll find my peeps in work and throughout my career. I’m only 22 and there is plenty of time!”

Flash forward 12 years and I am one week sober tomorrow. As I reflect on the journey I now see the ways cannabis limited my ability to live a full life. Here are some of the ways:

-stay in and smoke instead of go out and socialize. 
-When socializing outside of the smoking circle, I was unable to connect to the non stoners which fueled my anxiety, stress, and depression.
-cut spending everywhere in order to fuel the habit.
-I truly believed cannabis was the perfect medicine for me instead of a drug addiction.
-I was open with everyone about my usage and felt this made it ok.

I have lost relationships, jobs, and a butt load of cash due in large part to cannabis.

One thing that I can’t share is what made me quit. It wasn’t one moment. It was when the weight of my journey became present and I saw clearly for the first time in my adult life. 

This is what I sacrificed as a user, and look where I could be if I had made better decisions.
  
Today I make better decisions am excited for all the challenges ahead.

Thank you all for sharing your stories and they influenced some of these  revelations.

Happy Mother’s Day and stay well friends🙏",17,0

Hello. Today is twelve days since I last smoked weed. Twelve days ago, when I made the decision to quit smoking for the thousandth time, I also found this subreddit. The posts here help me to stay firm in my decision and this time I think it will work. But what I didn't know is that I was going to discover the root of another problem of mine here in this subreddit. 

 It has been a long time (about one year and a half) that I have had problems related to sleep. More specifically, problems with nightmares. In the worst cases, I have three to five nightmares in one night.     
I always wake up between one nightmare and another. I stay awake for a while, then I try to sleep again just to have another nightmare, sometimes I even return to the previous nightmare. That sucks. I remember them all the next day, to the point of being able to describe them in detail to my girlfriend while we're having breakfast. 

 I am not a daily smoker, but I am what I like to call ""intermittent daily smoker"". It goes something like this: I  take 3-5 days break without smoking, usually when I am on a exams week or really busy with work, and then when things got better I go back to smoking almost everyday until im out of weed. Then the loop starts again. I realized that every time I was in those breaks, I went through these nightmares. My stoner logic was: ""ok, weed is so wonderful that it even solves my problems with nightmares."" 

 I never realized that marijuana was actually the CAUSE of these nightmares until I read here on this subreddit someone talking about ""nightmares"" as one of their withdrawal symptoms. 

 That's when I realized that I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms every time I took these breaks.    
I decided to stop smoking for other reasons, not because of the nightmares, and since I don't feel any other symptoms other than that, I never connected one thing with the other. 

 I have been smoking for more than 7 years intermittently, the longest break i ever did was around 20 days without smoking, but I never went longer than 1 month. That is my current goal. What I want to know is: do these nightmares eventually go away? How long until that happens? Some days I don't have any nightmares, but on others, the nightmares are horrible and destroy my mood.",2,0

The dream had to be over 20 minutes long. I can remember so many details of it from so early in the dream. Some parts were actually really vivid and beautiful, but then it turned terrifying at the end, which is what woke me up. 

I won’t try to describe the whole dream, just the part that woke me up: Me and a friend were camping and had just set up our tent and were inside it. It was the end of the day and getting dark out. We were discussing that our other friend who had been with us has not been heard from, and we didn’t know where she was. This is when I started to become fearful. 

As we were talking, we heard a commotion outside of the tent. Thinking it might be our friend, I brushed open the tent door flap. Instead, there was a strange 4-legged creature standing there that instantly lunged at me. It was like a big opossum-ish animal with a large mouth that had no teeth and a very strange face, only way I can describe it. 

The creature bit my hand and engulfed my entire hand in its mouth. I pulled back and was trying to shake it off but couldn’t. That’s when I literally shouted out loud (in real life) and woke up. The dream felt scarily real. 

I got a tip from another user here that it helps to get up, get a glass of water, and write down details of what happened in the dream to calm down and put the weirdness in perspective. This is also apparently a technique to encourage lucid dreaming, where you are in control of the dream. 

Now sitting here next to my cat and it’s honestly freaking me out because it’s reminding me a bit of the creature haha. Anyways I’m gonna pet my cat a bit and try to get back to sleep.

I used it to numb my everyday problems, escape the pressure of law school and battle my loneliness. I've smoked copious amounts- I'm talking 7-10 fat joints a day. But day before yesterday when I smoked my last J at the night, I decided not to score anymore. I'm done being a pothead. The mental fog has been unbearable and I didn't realise that weed had started to make me feel shitty rather than happily stoned. I could never use it in moderation. If I had it, I would smoke it first and then do anything else. But yesterday was my first weed free day. I'll tell you what I felt. Woke up less irritable and didn't feel that my body was all hurting. Usually it takes me one hour just to beat the laziness and leave the bed, but not yesterday. I woke up like a springboard and could feel some differences in clarity of my mind. Morning tea never seemed more refreshing. 

But at 9 am I could feel the urge to smoke. I toyed with the idea of scoring but stopped myself somehow. Felt very very depressed and didn't do anything till 5.30 pm. Literally rolled on bed side to side with my back hurting like bitch.i couldn't fall asleep and felt shitty. 


At 6 pm I had had enough and I decided to go for a sprint. Ran 3k at average 6km/he. Felt liberated after all. That's when I knew this is what I had been seeking all along. Came back from run and did some sets of pushups. Finished it with a cold shower and nicely cooked dinner. 

But then sleeping was difficult. I tossed in bed till 2 am Last night. But guess what? I woke up at 7.30 am without feeling a little bit tired. Earlier I used to sleep 12-14 hours a day and still felt sleep, tired, exhausted and demotivated. But not today. Today morning has been kick-ass and I am sure I can leave weed for good now. It's in the past. Can't hold me back anymore. 


By the way, I have masturbated every single day for last 9 years multiple times a day. Yesterday was aso the first day of abstinence and semen retention. Feel more energized but I would observe it's benefits further andet you all know. 

Until then, stay strong and quit weed. No matter how much you tell yourself that one more joint would do you no harm, the truth is, weed takes away a lot from our lives. There's no way to escape this bitter truth.



Edit- I'm worried about tomorrow when I'll be all alone at home. If anybody can suggest ways to curb temptation of getting stoned or masturbating, please comment and let me know. I try distracting myself with exercise, YouTube, work even sleep, but I often end up rationalising to myself and say' ond last time'. Before I realise, I relapse.

I'm happy I've almost succeeded for staying sober today (just a few more hours), but it's also a little sad that I've been setting a final ""quit day"" for about the last 10 days too...

Usually, the first day that I intend to be sober, I find that I wake up with a resolve to abstain. However, soon after breakfast, that resolve slips into the background and I get attention-demanding thoughts about smoking slowly creeping into my head, along the lines of ""yea we can quit, but we could also get absolutely fried and just call it quits tomorrow, instead."" And usually, unless my dealer is dry, none of my friends are free, or I have something BIG due for school, I'll just cave in to those thoughts and just end up smoking weed.

I came to the conclusion that I need to fully detox on Thursday, and struggled through work (70 hour work weeks, fuck you start up life).

Recently I've been smoking only Saturdays, and today I decided I had to stop that, so it became my first fully sober weekend day in some time. I already have ADD and smoking always helped with that.

I woke up early and binge read/finished a book (a hella good one, which IMO is always tough to finish because you want more). I was bored so I made coffee and breakfast and took a shower and midday nap. I did laundry, got groceries, and started to weave a rag rug I had cut rags for ages ago. I worked on my 3d printer. I made some dope herbal iced tea, was unhappy with the rug, tore it apart and started again. I got groceries. I played with the cat. I got a cute bottle of cocktails and drank it and wove the rug on the porch in the sun and listened to a book on tape. I didn't do my taxes or clean or put away the laundry like I should have, but whatever. I roasted an eggplant and am about to make some marinara and pasta with it.

I did allllllll that and I still wanted to smoke. I still am attempting some mental gymnastics to justify a joint. I didn't give in but ...wtf brain? Surely I must realize that this is better, right?

These symptoms can royally suck, and can definitely spark the temptation to relapse. Especially when there's no end in sight.

Everyone's body is different, so your experience may differ greatly from mine. This is just how I experienced things over the past two months or so, and the methods I employed to help things. (I started smoking regularly when I was 23, and I'm 30 now, in case anyone's wondering.)

**Week 1:**

To steal a quote from my ever-so-charming father, the first week was the *drizzling shits.* From an anxiety perspective, I genuinely thought I was losing my damn mind. I had three panic / anxiety attacks in 5 days, two of which were so bad that I ended up jumping the gun a little bit and reaching out to a therapist. I'd breakdown, cry, and have horribly morbid thoughts. As bad as I was, I knew that smoking would only make things a million times worse, so I managed to push through. I avoided the heavy, dark media that I used to binge on (any fans of post-punk here?), and switched to more lighthearted content. Netflix has a lot of campy sitcoms and baking shows that helped me quite a bit. (Anything sad or morose just sent me into a mental tailspin.) This was also when I considered replacing my weed addiction with some kind of gym membership, so I wouldn't have the mental / physical capacity during the day to think about weed. I took to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and signed up for a trial month. 

If you're not into sports, or can't afford a program or club, I still highly recommend getting out of your house as much as possible. Weed made me incredibly agoraphobic over the years. As a result, I was prone to self-imposed isolation, and my anxiety was at its worse when I stayed inside for long periods of time, especially at night.

**Week 2:**

The anxiety was starting to get a *little bit* better, and I wasn't losing my shit as often. But now I had a new set of enemies: **Sleep and Appetite**. I weighed myself at the gym and was shocked by the results, especially given my height (5'11). I was so wrapped up in the carnival inside my head that I didn't even realize I had gone entire days without eating anything. From this point forward, I decided to force my meals down throughout the day, to get my weight back to normal. Takeout and restaurants were incredibly helpful during this time, as I rarely had the motivation to do anything, let alone cook. (I binged on Indian food in particular, since it was loaded with protein and carbs, and was relatively cheap.) It wasn't fun to force all this food down when I wasn't particularly hungry, but I noticed my natural appetite recover much faster after a week or so of doing this.

Sleep, on the other hand, was an entirely different story. I would stay up till 4:00 AM, fall asleep randomly, and then wake up at 7:30 AM - 8:30 AM, if I was lucky.

**Week 3:**

I started to have a lot of doubts in terms of my recovery. I realized that my anxiety issues (and general mental health) were pushed aside for years in favor of the comforting blanket that marijuana once provided me. Everything was floating to the surface: Past traumas, shit I thought I had gotten over, and the reality that I had practically fast-forwarded through the past 7 years. This was a lot to take, and it didn't help matters much that I was experiencing these INSANE ass dreams every night. I don't even know if ""nightmare"" accurately describes them. *Disturbing* might be a better term. Some of them were abstractions of my past, some were recreations of the pain I'd experienced growing up in a broken home, and some were just outright nonsensical and terrifying. This greatly amplified my insomnia, since I was scared of what I was going to experience while I slept. I started listening to podcasts before bed, in an attempt to distract my brain, but it didn't really help. (Apparently, this is caused by the rabid return of your REM sleep, which THC otherwise inhibits.)

**Week 4:**

This was around when I noticed the return of the **mental sharpness** I had initially lost from smoking. (I see a lot of posts where people talk in fear about this never coming back. I'm happy to say that it does!) 

Even when I smoked, I always felt like I was able to hide it pretty well. Of course, I'm sure the people in front of me would've had a slightly different opinion on that. When I got high, I would slur my speech, lose track of conversations, walk into a room and forget what the hell I was looking for, and then get stuck in these super repetitive thought loops. That pretty much stopped by this point, and I felt a lot clearer mentally. That being said, the volcano of my past continued to erupt, and I would have moments where I sat and reflected on things and thought, ""Damn, I can't believe I did that, said that,"" etc. I started to realize that maybe I needed more help than simply just quitting.

**Week 5:**

This was really hard to deal with, because my girlfriend pointed out that I was becoming more and more irritable. I didn't personally think I was, but then again I never thought I had a drug problem either. I started seeing the therapist I contacted, to deal with the mood swings, which is something I never would've considered in a MILLION years, and then slowly started piecing together the fragments of my 7 year stoned stupor. I created a plan for my future, and curated my social media so that I didn't have to see a crap load of weed related content every ten seconds. Even at this point, I had never really had any cravings, just nostalgia for the days when I could enjoy weed without these issues. I was able to get rid of these tender moments by comparing weed to a really hot ex whose toxic traits would never go away, no matter how appealing she appeared after significant time apart.

**Week 6:**

Shit hit the fan a bit when it came to my mood. Me and my girlfriend were arguing quite a bit, mostly because of me, and the dreams were still an issue, but I felt a lot better otherwise. I was able to stop my anxiety 75% of the time by closing my eyes and taking deep breaths whenever I felt those irrational thoughts coming on. I opened up more in therapy, and started to have epiphanies about why I turned to weed in the first place, which subsequently lightened my mood up a lot.

**Week 7:**

Overall, things have improved tremendously. However, getting good sleep without experiencing a fucked up cinematic tale of misery remains the general bane of my existence. I'm also not exactly in the greatest mood all the time. My girlfriend says that sometimes I can't take a joke, or that I obsess over trivial shit. When I felt like this before, I'd smoke and feel instantly better. I don't have that anymore, so it's forced me to be more self-aware of how I treat people.

The good thing is, I'm not scared to go outside anymore, not scared to talk to people, not scared to go on a gig for something I've done a million times before. I used to be terrified of the world like you wouldn't believe. I'd get hired for a job and endlessly question myself and my abilities. Anticipation would ruin me. I'd look to the future and see a void, rather than potential. That's all gotten a lot better. I still struggle with it, and occasionally a dark thought or two creeps in, but subsequent therapy sessions have started to level that out. I have more good days than bad, which I'm really happy to say.",195,0

At the tail end of 2018 I was smoking daily and doing a 50mg edible. I stopped for 3 months in 2019, through insomnia and night sweats and extrene paranoia and anxiety. Then I felt better, got bored, tried it again, a month later was back to being daily. 2 months after that, decided I would find ""balance"". Well it's been 2 years since then and it's been pretty much the same pattern: ""only on the weekends"" becomes ""the occasional weekday is okay"" to ""I'm having problems sleeping and I need to take a break again"". 

Well 2 weeks ago I hit that ""need a break"" point again, didn't smoke at all last weekend and felt great all week. Yesterday decided to celebrate it being friday and smoked and had an edible. I didn't really enjoy it tbh and I binge ate too. Feeling shitty all day today, kinda sad cuz I enjoy the idea of weed, I just don't enjoy anything about it anymore. I still love my stoner shows, video games and all that stuff, I just don't enjoy doing any of it high. 

So I guess it's been decided for me. I'd call this day 1, but I know it won't really be too hard at this point. Kinda feeling sad and would love to hear from anyone who can relate to this!",14,0

I was never really into drugs or drinking until the beginning of this year. I started smoking weed with my partner, and we would smoke between three and eight joints a day - we would be stoned the whole day and this continued for nearly three months. Stoned when we woke up, when we ate, after we ate, when we had sex, when we went for naps, before bed and the cycle repeated. I went from being a sober person with no drug history to someone who was stoned everyday and smoking quite a lot for a few months. Non stop. 

I have a history of mental health problems and I do believe smoking made me forget any of them existed. this continued until I had a really bad panic attack after smoking and decided to quit cold turkey after smoking non stop for two and a half months. The first few days were fine ... I felt emotional and had a lot of physical symptoms like sickness, cold sweats, headaches etc ... I’m now going on to Day 8 and it’s the mental symptoms that are scaring me.

I can’t eat, I feel too sick to even smell good. I have terrible intrusive thoughts and debilitating anxiety that I never had before. My health anxiety is through the roof and I’ve convinced myself I have gave myself permanent brain damage because I am so dissociated and panicky 24/7 right now. I have also lost my sex drive completely.. I can’t even think of sex or look at my partner sexually because I’m too numb. Everything feels numb and spacey.

Please someone tell me if this is normal and please someone tell me if this is going to get better. I feel like I’ve ruined my brain and I’m worried I’m never going to be normal again. 

I’ve tried to reach out to a few smoker friends about these withdrawals and everyone is saying weed withdrawals are impossible but I never felt anxiety like this before I started smoking. I feel like I’m going crazy. Help!",7,0

I'm so disappointed in myself and angry at the same time, I just needed to get this off my chest. 

My relationship with weed has been a tough road where I was extremely addicted but always denied I was. I couldn't go a single day without it but addicted? Ofcourse not. I smoked daily from 16 until now, being 26. 

About 3 months ago I got caught in a random police control and had to do a saliva test. Obviously I tested positive and the ball started rolling from there. I knew this had severe consequences and the police told me that I would have to get a whole examination to test if I was allowed to keep my drivers licence. 

I quit there and then and actually made it two months without weed. I was so proud of myself and forgot my whole run-in with the police. About a month ago I started smoking again, just one I said, but in two weeks I was back to where I started. I hadn't heard anything from the police anymore so why not enjoy life again the only way I know how. 

Three days ago I got the letter that my drivers licence has officially been revoked and I would have to do a physical and psychological exam to judge if I am fit to drive in the future. There is a big chance they will judge me as a drug-abuser and I won't get through the test. And here I am again, sober and disappointed in myself that I have to quit again and the consequences of my stupid actions. 

I'm just so tired. I know what I did was stupid and I'll have to live with the outcome of it. Why am I so addicted and why is life so dull without weed? Even after I had quit for 2 months I still thought about it every single day and didn't feel myself coming back to life like some other leavers experience. 

What if I just can't do it? What if I need weed in my life to make it at least a little enjoyable? I hoped so bad that I would see a side of myself without weed that I would enjoy, the hard truth is that that side just isn't there. 

I want to quit but don't want to quit. I just don't know anymore.",3,0

When I was using, scrolling on my phone used to take up 5 hours a day for me. Minimum. 2 hours in the morning, 2 at night, then some in the day time. That shit really adds up!!

When I decided to get sober I picked up a few new hobbies to fill in the time. There's been a very slow shift, but now I'm at the point where my brain needs more stimulation and longer projects. Previously I only had the attention span to read short posts, videos and pictures with captions... Now I'm sober my life is so varied! I have creative hobbies, I can watch a whole movie and notice the details. I'm making stuff all the time! I learnt to cook, and now I'm leaning to bake! I baked a cake this week.

I have depression and OCD to some degree and have been feeling this way for the last 2-3 years. Weed was helping at first but now it is making life very difficult as it is not helping with the symptoms rather it is making them worse.

I graduated with an engineering degree in December 2020. Since then I have been just sitting around and smoking. My parents are the great and don't make me pay bills or anything. I realised that me not having to pay for anything in itself is a very big gift and most people are not in that position. I have come to understand that life becomes difficult when you allow yourself to become stagnant. I am not doing enough in life to have something to look forward to and really putting myself out there. I feel like I haven't done enough to try out different hobbies and really looking for a job. At this point, it becomes really easy to smoke and continuing the current habit. I will be 24 on the 13th of May and I just want to be happy and become a proper adult. I don't want to be a kid anymore and just smoke. I am not saying that if you smoke you are a kid but I definitely become one myself because I begin to completely ignore all responsibilities and goals that I have set for myself. 

I am appreciative of this sub and for everyone in here because we are all on a journey to better ourselves and reach our realised potential. Thank you to all of my brothers and sisters that have given me love and encouragement in this sub no matter how many times I relapsed and posted it or not.

Even though it doesn't feel like it yet, life is great but you have to take those steps to make it great. Feeling great and being happy doesn't just come to you. You have to go out there and find happiness even if it comes little by little.

As many others, I always had my reasons to quit. In past, they were because feeling lazy all the time, not being able to socialize with others, caring about a single thing all day (which is weed) etc. Pretty much any addict's troubles. Yet, they were not enough apparently.  Well this time, I am broke. Like really really broke. 

I am from Turkey, where bud is extremely illegal. When I first started to smoke, I was a freshman in university, had no job, all my income was from my parents as allowances. And I was high 24/7 without worrying about the price. It was cheaper than cigarettes. Fast forward today, I have to spend 70% of my income on weed. Especially after Covid, prices skyrocketed.  For the last 2 years actually, I was trying to manage smoking weed and managing my finances. No joke, at the end of month, I always had negative balance and some sort of new debt for these last 2 years. Just because of weed. I don't do anything else; no dating, no vacation, no hobbies, no online shopping etc. All the money I had was going either weed or something related to my son. Obviously child support is not helping as well. 

On top of everything, last week I had to ask for a loan. Because I had some expenses came out from out of no where, and I needed some cash. No surprise, I did not have any saved money. That also got me to thinking that, if I ever needed money again for something urgent, I would be fucked. My parents are long gone, no siblings, no wife, or partner in that matter. Now that I realize is that my only support is a private bank, I need to make some changes.  Well the change is obvious, going cold turkey, quitting, renovating myself or whatever you call it. Unless someone offers me 5 grams of weed every day for free, this is not sustainable.

There is a 17 days hard lock down here in Turkey, and as a responsible addict, I bought my stuff before the shutdown. However, 4 days ago, I called my friend and asked if he needs some buds. He is the only knows that I smoke, so obviously, he was pretty surprised. He asked if I was serious and I told him, I really don't want to do this, but you have to come. He is working for delivery so no restrictions during lockdown. He got here, I took out my stash, started to roll this last joint. After it is finished, I gave him the joint and asked him to smoke it here. He did, I did not participate. And after he was done, he took everything and gone. I gave him my grinder (has a sentimental value to me) and all the related materials. 

It has been 4 days, and I am not happy. I crave like a bitch, I can't sleep, I am agitated and angry 24/7. I am extremely bored. I can't get any joy from anything. It wasn't like I had hobbies or anything before but, now I can't even play pc games or watch tv shows etc. I don't see the point. If it wasn't for the money, I would stay stoned all day, every day. I honestly don't see any joy or point in this life. I know this is dark, and I know it is weed making me think that way. From what I have gathered from this sub, it gets better. Some people even talking about getting high from life itself. I know this won't apply for me. And to be honest, I was expecting some sort of recovery after 4 days. For me, it just gets worse. I don't eat, not sleeping well, I am always depressed. I am checking the clock every  5 minutes, I got nothing to do. I really don't want to do anything.

How difficult it is, the cravings etc. Overwhelming, folks are terribly harsh on themselves and it seems there are big expectations for change within a relatively short amount of time. But like most good things in life, this will take time. Addiction and recovery takes time. 

This isn’t a video game: I'm not racking up points. This isn’t a binary “Win / Lose” scenario. This is going to be more like a dance. A rhumba, a salsa, a mambo — two steps forward, three steps back, three steps forward, one step sideways …. and cha-cha-cha everyone !

If we expect attempts at recovery from a mind-altering substance that has compromised our brain’s dopamine and frontal cortex for years to dissipate after just one attempt, the odds are very slim we will succeed.  

!! Let’s Do The Math !!

\- Let’s say I have been smoking for 5 years every day. That’s 52 weeks x 5 years = 260 weeks

\- A 2 week quit cycle divided into 260 week habit = 0.8 % 

In this example, I’ve spent 5 years smoking each day, every day and I'm 2 weeks into a quit cycle and feeling bummed out. Yet only 0.8% of my time smoking, I’ve spent trying \*NOT\* to smoke. Less than 1% of my time.

There are new skills and behaviours I need to learn in order to quit. Is there \*any\* other new skill in my life that you would beat myself up about if I didn’t master it more than 1% after taking it up for only two weeks ? or two months ? A new sport ? A new hobby ? skill ? What if I took up surfing or golf or motorcycle riding and after 2 weeks was less than 1% “good” at it. Would I go “Oh man, I suck at this ! I’m such a failure !” and quit ? If I tried woodworking (not likely, but y'know... as an example...) and my first attempt at a memento box came out looking like a dog’s breakfast, would I assume I sucked at woodworking ? A new skill takes time for competence, much less mastery, to arrive.

I’ll tell you what this is not : This is not going to be a straight 45 degree incline on an X / Y graph labelled “Quitting Weed”. It's not going to happen. If I think it will, I'm setting yourself up for disappointment at the very least, and at the very worst, putting myself in a head space of blame, shame and negative self-talk. I’ve been there. Please don’t do it. It’s great to be goal-oriented, but patience Young Jedis. We’re going for the Long Game here. 

Adjust expectations and be gentle on yourself. And in the name of JesusMaryJosephandtheweelittledonkey, give ourselves time. Remember, it’s a dance — three steps forward, two steps back and cha-cha-cha !

But while I was using there was way too much shame and guilt and fear, and after the smoke had cleared the moment just never felt right. So even though she knew I had gotten sober I always made it sound like not a big deal, just a simple life adjustment for health that I was making.

Anyway last night we were up late in bed talking. I had just installed blinds in our room and a bunch of other rooms in the house and she was marveling at my handiness. To which I said, you know it's really just 90% sobriety, not any special skill I have. Which is true, I'm nothing special with home repairs but being sober has majorly improved my energy and focus and confidence, and allows me to do these kinds of projects.

She got this kind of funny look and said, I didn't know sobriety was that big of a change for you? Well at that point the whole story kind of came tumbling out. I wasn't planning to talk about it that night but I had long since decided I wouldn't lie to her if she asked me about it. We ended up talking for an hour about everything I went through, how addicted I was, how much I was using, what it took to quit. It turned out she had no idea. It was emotional and she was shaken up at first by the feeling of not having known, but after we talked about it long enough it ended in a good place.

This was kind of the last big thing I had to do on the sobriety journey so I guess I felt like I ought to share it with you all. Thanks for all the support.",475,0

I sold the things that I love so I could use you. You made me not be able to deal with emotions which caused me to have the darkest times in my life as I would constantly fight with my parents. Sometimes getting to the point where they’d call the police on me. That’s not who I am at all. The thing I hate you the most for is driving my best friend/ girlfriend away from me.

Anyways, after 3 year of sobriety, I relapsed. Everything in my life was going great. I got into med school 6 months after quitting weed and discovered im actually not dumb at all (as I used to believe). I started working out 6x/week and changed my body completely (Gained over 30lbs of muscle). My self-steem was finally where it should be. Started dating this sweet girl about 1 year ago. Made some really good friends at college, and that was really new to me, actually knowing people not weed-related. I didnt really think about marijuana anymore, after 3 months of quitting my body and mind didnt beg me for thc (as it used to), so sobriety got easy overtime.

So November/2020 came and fucked me up real good, I didnt even see it coming. I woke up a random monday feeling a lot of pain in my butt (NO JOKE), went to the ER and surprise: Perianal Abscess followed by anal fistula. Anyway, I was in constant pain for about 3 months and had to get surgery 2 times. In the meantime, I couldn't workout anymore, couldn't meet my friends or go to class because of Covid-19 cases here in Brazil plus my recovery from surgery. So my mind and body went downhill from there. Weed began to sneak into my mind once again, as a good idea cause It diminishes pain (Maybe a reward for my suffering subconsciously?)

48 days ago, after a whole month of fantasizing I acted on it. Hit up my friend who hooked me up with some OG Kush, the best Ive ever seen (keep in mind the main source of thc in south america is Brick Weed, Its really hard to come by some high quality stuff). So, after 3 years of no smoking, I tought just MAYBE I could moderate right? Nope, we cant. If we could, we wouldn't be on r/Leaves in the first place. 

So as expected, High Me took over control real hard and I smoked over 2oz so far. In the meantime, I started hiding from my gf and parents to smoke. Started skipping zoom classes to get high. And now that im allowed to hit the gym again, Im doing it high all the time. Even though I see how cannabis is consuming my life, I cant seem to escape the cycle once again.  High me wants to be sober, Sober me wants to be high.

I think the worst part has been the anxiety, I still get the good body high from smoking, but it comes with waves of guilt and I honestly dont think its worth it. Weed takes way more than it gives us. I can see what weed is doing to me, I feel hollow waiting for my next hit on a joint. And that same feeling got me to quit 3 years ago.

I think the time has come to do it again. I gotta free myself from this shit, break the cycle and take back control of my life. I dont have the time/space for weed anymore, I realized that while sneaking this ""habit"" (Addiction) back into my life this last month. Sorry about the long rant guys, just felt in my heart I had to share. If any of you are fantasizing about cannabis, be extra aware. IT'S NOT WORTH IT!",29,1

I’ve started experiencing night terrors a lot more now, some dreams that make no sense but I wake up feeling super crap and anxious because of them. They feel so real and at times super vivid, a lot of them revolving around fears I have in real life.

My appetite is starting to come back now too, I went the first week with only eating a very small meal a day (for example 2 chicken wings at most). Have even managed to put my lost weight back on!

I am starting to get very small cravings now to smoke, but keep reminding myself that what I’m doing is for the best. Maybe one day I will smoke a J again to see if I enjoy it but I doubt that will be anytime soon.

One thing I fear is that I spent everyday from age 16 smoking and being high, a lot of things I used to involved me smoking before I did them. So now I can’t find any enjoyment in video games, watching TV, etc. Hopefully when Covid restrictions ease I can start going out more and trying new things.

Because I'm a weed abuser who is older than dirt (64) and female, I have tons - and I mean TONS - of experience dealing with night sweats ( that's Change of Life / menopause hot flashes for those of you who need it spelled out) That's 16 years of night sweat / hot flash experience; each night; every night: at least twice at night, sometimes six times. So when I get weed withdrawal and night sweats, I'm very much prepared. Here's what  I've learned - maybe it will help:

1. BEDDING - flannel sheets are cozy, but they are not your friend right now. Ditto flannel sleepwear. Switch it out for cotton. Yes, both cotton and flannel are hydrophilic and absorb water / sweat, but the deep pile on flannel means it hangs on to dampness for a longer time. Cotton sheets will at least evaporate sooner. You'll be more comfy.
2. WATER - Like the Camelbak ads used to say ""Hydrate or Die"". Keep water by your bedside. And not in a glass ! Gawd, at some point you may reach for it, knock it over, big mess, triggering a temper tantrum in the middle of night .... put it in an exercise bottle / S'well / Yeti / squeeze bottle and keep it near by. All the time.
3. MEDITATE - this one may not be your cup of tea. Meditating isn't natural for me - I have what my Buddhist friends call ""a monkey mind"". But apps can help with guided meditations, where someone else does all the work and takes you to a relaxed place. I encourage you to try it to help with insomnia. I use Headspace, and they have specific meditations to use before going to bed. They're insanely effective. I did one last night, and the when it said, ""Start counting slowly to 10, and then start over...."" I started counting in my head, and got as far as ""One.... tw....."" before I was out like a light.
4. SLEEP ALONE - If you have a partner you might not like this advise. But if you are floppy in the bed - just migrate. To another bed or the sofa - wherever. There's no point both of you being miserable. You can starfish out your body to dissipate the sweat without disturbing anyone else's rest. Then at least there won't be two of you in the house grumpy and sleep deprived in the morning.
5. BOOZE - don't drink before bedtime. Alcohol disturbs our rest. I know, I know ! we're quitting weed, we need SOMETHING ! naw. You don't. If you can, keep away from booze, at least during the night sweat phase.
6. FOOD - go easy on the spicy stuff. For at least a week or two while dealing with this.
7. NEW PILLOW - If you have the means, I strongly recommend those pillows that come with a ""cool side gel"". They really do work. You will notice a difference in comfort and coolness around your head, hairline and neck - and that's where the majority of the sweat accumulates. You won't be constantly pounding and flipping the pillow, looking for ""the cool side"".....
8. OPEN A WINDOW - crack open a window in your bedroom. Fresh air helps.
9. SURRENDER - finally what I've learned over the decades dealing with night sweats and insomnia is that if all else fails, just surrender. Just give up, acknowledge that Mother Nature is having her way with you right now, and no one is bigger, tougher than Mother Nature. She's gonna win. So just get up, make an herbal tea, read a book, read this sub, watch a movie quietly so you don't disturb others ........ just get up and occupy yourself with light endeavours. There's no point beating yourself up about it. The sun rises and sets on us all. You'll get another chance to sleep soon. Maybe try that meditation app.....

I hope this helps some of you. Oh, and remember - this weekend is Mother's Day. Call your Mom. And if you have a mom over the age of 50, after dealing with night sweats yourself now, you may now have some new insights and compassion as to why she can get so damn cranky sometimes :D.",338,0

I offered to roll them the joint, it's like riding a bike haha, I blessed them and rolled an A1 pearl.
We walked out of the house and headed to a nearby park. We had taken that walk hundreds of times in the past. It felt so familiar. We sat on a park bench and they lit up. Weed smoke blew in my face as I sat there with a beer in hand. I was tempted, but I didn't give in and I didn't smoke. My rationality and will power usually diminishes to zero when I'm drunk, but it didn't yesterday. I realise I have come so far, previously being the biggest fiend for a smoke sesh, I can now hold back and see the bigger picture. I have never felt better in my life, so why would I risk throwing that away now? My mindset is just different now.

I just hope i don't lose my streak cause I'd be pissed af. Going strong in small steps, day by day. For now im setting a goal for one month because i don't want to take too big of a step, but I'm sure it's going to be much longer than that.

The last two nights I used sleep aids because I had to be up at 6am for work. Tonight I’ve just been drinking water and despite being awake for 20 hours I’m not tired at all. All I’ve been able to eat is a handful of nuts and some cheese. Ugh. The worse part is knowing there is still so many hard days in front of me and not even really knowing if sobriety will truly help ... the only thing that made me happy for a long time has been weed.

I'm 29, started smoking weed at 24(I think). Quit, started again, and now after dealing with serious depression and pulling myself out of a dark place, I'm not smoking anymore. I smoked daily, multiple times a day of dank weed, so yeah, go me.

I run daily, 8 miles one day, and 4 the next and trade off. Lift 3 times a week. I rest on weekends. Fitness isn't something I'm new to, I've just taken it more seriously the past few months. I'm eating well, no soda, snack foods or any bad stuff. Leafy greens, fruit, chicken breast etc...

I'm not trying to boast and I'm deeply sorry if it comes off as that, I just want to know what can I do to get better sleep. I feel tired, but won't stay asleep longer than maybe 3 hours. Here's the kicker, I can lay there with my eyes closed and feel ""rested"" but not get any REAL sleep.

I can PROMISE I don't want to smoke again, I'm good. My tolerance level was so high that I wasn't even getting high anymore. I'm in a great place, I feel great if I can say that? I'm happy, but I need sleep. I'm trying meditation soon and I hope that helps, but sheesh I'm skeptical. The lack of sleep is preventing me from doing the things I need to do and things I love to do. I've even taken up studying a foreign language seriously and I'm doing well, but it's hard to focus during the day on that when you didn't sleep the night before!

Thanks for reading, sorry the long post! <3

For years I wished I could be sober but I was never willing to put in the work to do it. Finally I decided I needed to try, I mean **really** try, and it was the decision to *not* make it out to be some monumental achievement in my mind that actually let me start to step toward it. 

If I could give one piece of advice to anyone struggling to quit or thinking about trying - take it one day at a time. That’s it. Just choose tomorrow to be a day you will not get high. Within 24 hours you will have already achieved success and feel motivated to do it again. Staring down 30, 60, 100, or 300+ days from a mindset of being high all the time feels impossible because it basically is. It takes a mindset change that you need to allow yourself to build up to. So believe in yourself and invest in your success. Celebrate your accomplishments no matter how small they may seem, because even 6 hours of sobriety when you can’t go that long now without weed is an achievement.

A friend is coming by tomorrow to get the remaining paraphernalia that I wanted to rehome instead of throwing out.

Holding my old bong felt eerily natural, and cleaning out my grinder brought me back to those nights spent scraping the last bit of flower together for a bowl. I don’t miss it, but it felt so comforting and familiar to have these old things back. How many years of my life had I repeated the same smoking patterns that even holding my bong felt a bit like home?

That little voice in the back of my head was like “what’s one hit really going to do? Maybe it wasn’t as bad as you remember.” 

I had to sort of chant to myself “I’m not this person anymore. It served its purpose, and now it’s in the past. I don’t need it” over and over while I cleaned it because it would have felt so normal to just pack a bowl and take a hit.

Still sober, and doing alright. But, damn. I did not think I was still so susceptible.

I just hope to help anyone I can by sharing my experience.,"I’ve never posted anything on reddit. I’ve always been scared to because it seems like such a judgemental place that even using an emoji is apparently frowned upon. 
When I found this group I promised myself that when I stopped or started quitting I’d post something in the hopes it helps others so here goes. (Be gentle) This is also going to be long AF. So sorry but not sorry if it even helps just one person out there. There’s no TL;DR because ultimately there’s no short cuts here. I’ve tried to highlight where the tips are below incase you cbf reading all this but if you do then I appreciate you.

Standard info.. 
I’m a 30yo male and have smoked ever since I was 17-18. It was an everyday/all day habit. I’d organise my life around weed. I’d smoke upwards of about 30 cones a day. At least two every 2 hours while at work and a free for all once I got home. A few times I even pulled cones while sitting in actual heavy traffic because I couldn’t go another 30mins without. Id buy an ounce every fortnight and recently it seemed like it was more frequent than even that. 

It regulated my diet, my sleep, my moods and if I didn’t smoke I’d get physical withdrawals where I’d throw up and feel nauseas, constantly felt like I had to clear my throat, I’d dry reach after brushing my teeth and at random points in the day if I didn’t get a good enough hit. I’d tell people I didn’t smoke to her high anymore I smoked to get normal. 

I was constantly depressed and disappointed in myself and my life and felt like I wasn’t living to my full potential and because of this didn’t feel like I was a capable father, employee or person in general. 

In 2019 I broke up with my boyfriend of 6 years and this gave me the motivation to cut down and practically quit for the first time since I began smoking. I again had physical withdrawals where I threw up, I only ate roughly two-three mouthfuls of food the first week and lost a lot of weight. I’ve always been ridiculously thin but this time even I was worried about how thin I got. The physical withdrawals ended after the third or fourth day and all I had to do was just deal with the cravings. 

At first I managed to cut down to once a week and then once a month, I started saving money I never had and had done things I never knew I would be capable of doing. That’s until life got difficult due to multiple reasons and I picked up old habits again. 

This time it was back and with a vengeance and I was even more upset in myself for knowing what I could do and what I had when I quit and seeing how much of a struggle life really was while I was on it. 

Wednesday the 28th of last month I began a weeks holiday from work with the sole purpose of quitting again. I knew I couldn’t do it while I was working because of the stresses from work / having to deal with the withdrawals and being expected to function whilst there. 

I’m glad to say since that day I have not smoked weed or a cigarette which I was also heavily addicted to. 

Leading up to it I realised the actual fear of quitting and the fear of failing was the biggest struggle. I knew what to expect physically and mentally I just didn’t want to have to deal with that. 

To my surprise this time it was A LOT less severe. I didn’t throw up, the cravings died down faster than expected and in that week I managed to help my girlfriend move 3+ hours away and helped her family do their end of lease clean practically with just her and I. 

The fear of having a cigarette and having that trigger the need for a cone was and still is a major factor as to what’s keeping me from giving into both. I’ve had more money in my account this week than I have since I took it all up again and I can finally see the sun shining figuratively speaking. 

Therefore I wanted to write this and give people a few tips from my experience and let you all know some answers to questions I’d hope to find from previous posts on here. 

(IF YOU WANNA SKIP ALL THE BS START READING HERE!)

1. Take time off work/life to be able to lay in bed and feel like shit. It sucks but it’ll pass sooner than expected
2. The first two days are the hardest but if you push through that the rest will be easy. 48hrs of heavy cravings and sleeplessness is worth the weeks/months/years of sobriety. 
3. Water is a great help when you feel like you’re getting a craving. You’ll still feel “not right” or on edge during that craving but sipping water somehow minimises it in my experience 
4. Get yourself some cuppa soups or tinned soups, you won’t wanna eat it and you may even throw it up but it’s better than nothing and nothing will make the whole experience feel worse. Once you can start eating again, don’t over indulge (if you’re someone who smokes after every meal even if it’s a snack) don’t eat until you’re full, eat until you’re fed because feeling full and sick from eating will make you want to smoke.
5. Play the sims.. it kept my mind busy the first two days and I didn’t realise how much time would pass especially when I made characters and then built their homes from scratch. (Stay distracted but lazy distracted. Don’t over exert yourself) 
6. Going to sleep will be hard because of old habits, you won’t feel tired and you’ll toss and turn but it’ll eventually happen. It may be short and it may be broken but the first night trying to sleep is the hardest, the rest get easier pretty much immediately 
7. Don’t tell anyone you’re doing this. Keep it to yourself. If you give in you’ll feel less like a disappointment but any progress you made will at least motivate you to try again without feeling like you’re being judged for trying again and again
8. GIVE YOUR STUFF AWAY. I gave all my weed and weed related stuff to my girlfriend to hold onto so I couldn’t give into temptation and I msged my dealer asking them to not sell to me for a month regardless of any excuse I gave. I forced myself away from it for my own good so even if I had a violent craving I just had to deal with it. Fortunately I didn’t have any violent cravings but I’m still maintaining the ban just to be safe. 
9. Sounds dumb but isolate yourself for the first couple days. I unfortunately live with family so it was difficult for me especially with an overbearing grandmother but being able to sit and feel shit without people around is easier than feeling shit and having to deal with people. Hence taking time away from work and life. This is a you thing, no one else.
10. Don’t “cut down” or try to wean off.. don’t delay the inevitable because nothing will make this easier than just doing it. But you have to do it on your terms, even if it takes you weeks or months to get to a position where you can, plan for the success. It took me over a month from putting in my annual leave to being able to actually take the week off. I didn’t cut down, I wanted to but I didn’t I just lived life as I normally would and the night before I gave all my stuff away I smoked right up until I fell asleep. When morning came it was go time and once it was all gone from my house that’s when I started.
11. Remember you’re addicted to something addictive. You’re not broken, you’re not a failure. Some people can have a smoke and be done, some can’t. It’s normal that you can’t you’re not the only one and you definitely can get over it. Don’t beat yourself up over it. Stay motivated by thinking about the money you can save and what you can do with that money and the freedom getting off weed can give you. The first time I stopped I began learning to skydive which has been my life long dream and I plan to get back into it and finish it and get my certification to be able to do it solo around the world. If you get through two days and give in, that’s still an achievement. If you get through half a day when you used to smoke all day that’s an achievement. So long as you have the drive and motivation and intention to quit you’re still ahead and doing great. If you’re reading this, you’re doing great and I’m very very proud of you for even considering it. 
12. If you want to test the waters, try missing a few cones/jays/whatever you do during a time when you WOULD have had it. I always smoked after I ate anything. The week leading up I tried not smoking for an hour or so after eating to see how that felt, you’ll find it’ll probably suck for 10mins then it’ll die down a bit. 
13. I didn’t do it this time but for what it’s worth, when I first cut down back in 2019 I started doing home workouts. That also seemed to alleviate some cravings. 
14. Keep your mouth clean, I use mouthwash religiously, all day every day. At first it was cause I hate the taste of smoke lingering in my mouth, but I found having a clean mouth now somehow made it easier not to smoke. Weird.. I know..

(STOP READING HERE IF YOU’VE GOT WHAT YOU NEED) 

I’m sure if I tried to think hard enough I could come up with more but that’s the main ones. I’m still scared I’ll get back into it but I’m trying to stay motivated. 
I’ve certainly had and still have cravings and I’m trying to push the idea that “it’s just easier to smoke” out of my head. 
I started work two days ago and my work sucks ass, I definitely would not be at this point had I not taken the time off. The stress from work yesterday made me want a cigarette and the fear of wanting a cone from that made me have neither. I just pushed through a shitty day and went to bed early. 

I don’t know what else to add. I’m still going through this and learning myself but what I’ve said so far are observations and tools I’ve used to help me. 

I never in my life since starting and becoming a heavy smoker thought I’d get to this point. I was prepared to live my life a stoner and accepted myself as this but IT IS POSSIBLE to stop. At any age. No matter how long you’ve smoked. No matter how difficult it seems you can do it. If it’s for a day, a week, a month or even just an hour, you can do it. Any one can.

Weed feels like the only respite, even though I know it's short term band aid fix.","I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I'm 22 and moved back with my parents for the pandemic to save money. I started smoking again then, since we're in a house in the suburbs in the middle of nowhere. I spent probably $600-1k a month on weed for around 4 months, then quit for a month and a half (it sucked), then re-smoked 2 weeks ago for a couple days and quit again. At this point, it's extremely clear to me that weed won't make my situation better. But it's the only escape I have.

Everyone arounds me tells me I should be loving my life; that I'm ""good looking"", I went to an ivy league school and have a 200k job (I always feel like not enough) that I'm starting soon as a software engineer, my parents love me and are there for me. It makes me feel *even worse* that I can't recognize any of those things as good, or appreciate them. I feel nothing but numbness and sadness. My mom asks how she can help, does everything to make it better, and I don't know the answer. After five months of seeing a therapist who was supposedly world renown, I gave up on him because I realized I made absolutely zero progress. I don't feel actively suicidal, but in a sense it feels even worse.

Every day, life passes me by, I do nothing but scroll reddit and watch netflix. I don't know how I'm gonna maintain the job I have when I start soon and am already starting to worry about becoming a failure who blew their opportunity. I wish I could identify why I can't feel any emotion except melancholy and anxiety. In previous times that I'd smoked much more heavily and quit, my emotions came back and I actually felt motivated to do stuff. Now, nothing. I can literally say I've done nothing the past month since graduating. Just sitting in my room. I used to be excited about making new software projects and learning more, I would write code for fun, now I can't bring myself to type a single line.

And I know the classic advice is to get out, go for a walk, exercise. I have been doing light exercise on a treadmill, but I can't bring myself to go outside. There's nothing to do where I am, and I'm at an all time low. What's so ironic is that I always thought by this age with how hard I worked that I'd have life figured out. Instead, I feel like I know less than ever. I'm super cognizant that probably 99% of the world has it harder than me, but I can't *internalize* that because my depressed brain won't let me. I'm so tired of trying different prescried drugs when none do absolutely anything for me. I'm so tired of *being* tired. I feel so close to just giving up on life, because nothing I can think of would make it better. I can't express how bad the irrational sadness I feel within is. I have no emotion to really share with friends, my libido is nonexistent.

I'm at my wits end. I know no one here will have the solution, I've been to over ten therapists and none of them do, try as I might. But has anyone here gone through anything remotely similar? While I paradoxically know weed is a super short term fix, it's extremely hard to negate even that respite when I hate my life every single day. Nights are the absolute worst. There's a deep, deep loneliness inside.

I’ve decided to quit for good and stopped using completely about a week ago. As you can imagine, the sweating has been unbearable this past week. The other withdrawal symptoms haven’t been that bad, when I stopped before I had no appetite, trouble sleeping, anxiety, depression, etc.. but this time I’ve only had trouble sleeping and a bit of anxiety, though I know for sure those things will eventually go away. 

The sweating is the only thing that’s been really tough and I’m wondering if it could be related to something else or it’s for sure withdrawal symptoms and if I was still getting withdrawal symptoms while using because it had been a much lower amount than before? I had never had any problems with sweating before I started using weed, if anything it was the opposite, I rarely ever sweat even after the gym. 

Has anyone else experienced this before? Does the sweating eventually go away? Maybe it just takes months?",5,0

Well, I've been in college for a few years now and often drive back and forth between my university and hometown (about a 4-5 hour drive).  I don't purposefully drive high, but have driven high quite a few times.  It doesn't impair my driving as I've never driven blazed or anything (though I know it's still a risky and selfish choice and I am not trying to justify it), but I used to have the recurring thought/paranoia of ""omg what if I get pulled over.  I'm going to get in so much legal trouble"".  My eyes turn red really easily so it's a dead give away.  But because I was/am an addict, this paranoia was never enough to make me not make the choice to drive high which would be the obvious correct solution of course.  Anyway, yesterday I was driving home from uni and low and behold I got pulled over (my very first time too)! And even though I was upset, even though I was crying, the main thought in my head was ""I am so glad I'm not high right now.""  I've been sober for over a month now and was actually debating bringing my weed with me back home (I didn't).  And that situation just felt like a sign that confirmed I was most definitely doing the right thing quitting weed.  I got a ticket, but the cop was nice and let me off easy, and that was that.

1240,2021-05-07 16:15:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/n77uo2/losing_an_amazing_relationship_to_lying_about/,Losing an amazing relationship to lying about getting stoned.,"Background: I am a 26 y.o. mechanical engineering major. I smoked pot from 17-19 and started again at 23. The first time I tried college, I dropped out because I was getting stoned and not going to class. Admittedly, I definitely did not really want a computer science degree, so I guess it is what it is.

Two years ago, I decided to go back to school for mechanical engineering. Around the same time, I started a relationship with a beautiful, witty, resourceful gear head forest child who loves deeply and powerfully.

She has an alcoholic father and has sensitivities and trust issues relating to that. Initially, she said she was fine if I smoked, but she was not comfortable if I was around her when I did. I failed to respect that. A year passed and she changed her tune to only asking that I told her when I smoked. Again, I failed to do that over and over again.

I stayed away from weed from September to November of last year. I had straight A's and my relationship was going very well. I decided for spring semester (the one that just ended), I would be fine to amp up my course load and took a second job in effort to eventually phase out my bartending job.

Over winter break, I decided I could smoke a little bit and quit again. Guess who did not do that? So I got into a cycle of staying sober for most of the week, going to my job at the bar, having a few beers while I closed, wanting to get fucked up, but not get stupid drunk. I'd pick up a ∆8 cartridge. Then I'd be stoned for three or four solid days.

Well, two Fridays ago, she caught me for the last time. I have never been this sad in my life. Almost everything about the relationship other than my substance use was wonderful. We had disagreements, but were very effective in working through them. We did everything together and still love one another dearly, but she can't trust me. 

I decided to stay sober. I know that if I keep numbing, I'll go from catastrophe to catastrophe and probably cause most of them. I love the job that isn't in the bar, but it has a zero tolerance drug policy. If I keep using when will I lose that? I need a 2.7 GPA to stay in the engineering department at my school. I've been scraping and clawing to make that work, but how much easier would it have been if I stayed sober?

I quit the job in the bar, sucked it up and asked my mom for money to fill in the blanks because the bartending job was not good for me. I increased the density of visits with my therapist and levelled with them for the first time about how much I've been smoking. For that matter, I told everyone important in my life that I have a drug problem and that I wanted to help in staying clean. I've been going to meetings every day and I really do think I'll stay sober.

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll get my relationship back. She wants to go back to being friends when some time passes, but she had trust issues before me (alcoholic father) and I can't imagine she'll trust me again. She's amazing and honestly, I have been bored with smoking weed for a long time. I was never bored with our relationship.

I'm finally done my first year of law school, and summer is just a scary 4 month bait for relapsing and uncontrollable use.

In the past several werks spent sober I studied for and wrote exams. Celebrating today without smoking, drinking, or vaping, so that's good... but I feel like I'm entering into a new battle, if you will. Being sober left me with a lot of self-loathing. I feel obliged to blame cart abuse for robbing me of my ability to develop real, concrete memories, you bet it fucked with my capacity to focus. It felt like shit to have to study with all of that looming over me but I'm finally done, and I haven't hit any big enlightenment, likely bc I'm now dealing w/ the full onslaught of what I think are symptoms related to a bunch of things, CPTSD, ADHD, anxiety and depression, of course substance abuse disorder.

All that to say, sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's like you're walking in front of a relapse moment for days. Summer is just starting, and the majority of my mind keeps telling me that this is a free four month break to relapse. In a few hours myself and others will hear back about our candidacy for extra jobs offered in light of covid. They're only 4 weeks in length but they created the process quite open, not requiring resumes, being hand picked by profs to do some research and gain references, but even then I feel so garbage that I don't even know that I want one. Of course I'll like a jackass for denying it because of the pressure to perform in these settings, and how 'accessible' they made that process relative to every other job available to us. In the meantime, of course, I need to take the big step and reach out to some mental health professional, fortunately this morning before my exam i found an inclusive place to turn to for help, just need to do it. 

Anyways, Big sigh of relief and despair today; I appreciate the listeners out there and just want to wish well to everyone. I didn't have anybody to share these feelings with and hope at the least you are all in good shape ❤️",5,1

When this voice speaks up, it is equally necessary to believe that ***someday*** **I may be able to use cannabis responsibly.**

I have been on the journey to quitting for longer than I care to remember and this community has been great for little bursts of inspiration. 

To give some background I have been a smoker for 15 years and I would say for about 10 of those years I was smoking pretty heavily. The only time I spent sober were the hours I was at work, if I was home I would smoke from 8am to 2am the next day. I had a habit costing me around £500-600 a month which just wasn’t manageable. I have driven myself into debts elsewhere in my life to keep up my intake. 

For the last couple of years I have wanted to quit and honestly I have lost count of the amount of times I have told myself that today will be my last joint. I don’t enjoy smoking and haven’t for a long time, I don’t get the same feeling anymore when I light up and honestly I hate myself every time I do. 

This time feels different, I am midway through day 12 and this is the longest I have been sober in the last 15 years. I don’t know what changed for me but I had finally had enough of beating myself up for failing to quit. Every time I set a determination to get clean I would go back to smoking within a day or less. My head gave me constant excuses and reasons to pick up my grinder again and even though I knew it gave me no pleasure anymore I still found myself wasting my life smoking. I have missed out on so much because I would rather be at home smoking. Well not anymore, I am stronger than my addiction and so are all of you, it’s this thought and this thought alone that keeps me going. 

The withdrawal has been shitty don’t get me wrong but I am still going because I finally see all the reasons for stopping and I am able to use them to tell my addict brain to get to fuck. I live with another smoker and he is also facing his own battle, he has had several relapses and is finding it hard to get passed a couple of days. It is hard to see him struggling but I am so proud of myself for not giving in. 

I just want to put this on here for accountability and to say to each and everyone of you, you are an inspiration to me and I am proud of you all. Wherever you are in your journey keep fucking going, you got this!

I'm both shocked and proud of myself, didn't think this was something I would want to do let alone be able to control. As a brief history...I was a daily, heavy smoker, for YEARS and as of recent I was going through up to 2 oz of dry leaf in a week, with a mix of thc concentrates and edibles. I've spent more money than i'd like to admit on cannabis over the years, and want to allocate those funds to hobbies I once enjoyed.

7 days wasn't all easy, there's been a lot of night sweats and chills, weird appetite changes and some nausea but like others have said, that stuff is temporary and the natural ""high"" of being sober is something I forgot, and now embrace. Coming out of the fog is an experience in itself!

Some tips I would like to share is 1. Take it one day at a time. worry about today, that is what you can control. 2. Don't beat yourself up, accept what you were and work on fixing it. 3. It's a marathon not a sprint, change takes time and patience. If you fall or slip, keep moving forward. 4. Unfollow all those cannabis social media accounts and subreddits, it's not doing you any good, and helps you focus on other things in life

I almost left when I saw it was about quitting but decided to hang around see what its about. Lately though the posts have been hitting a bit too close to home and got me thinking about leaving. 

I'm 33, f, been smoking for 6 years on the daily. I also use nicotine but less than weed. I have clinically diagnosed ADHD-inattentive, depression and anxiety so I use it medicinally as pharma medication is expensive. I also have PTSD from a past abusive relationship and currently unemployed. I feel like smoking helps me to cope and get through the day. I feel borderline suicidal when I try to quit and my depression gets so, so much worse. And because I'm home alone all day with my thoughts, I smoke a lot.

I'm wondering if anyone here with depression or ADHD who quit and what was their experience? How do you manage the withdrawal and at the same time prevent a mental health regression? Is there a tipping point where you start feeling better and how many days/weeks is it generally? Would appreciate any tips please.",2,0

After quitting I felt very proud of myself, I knew my reasons to quit and could even go see my friends while they were smoking and not even crave a hit. I was feeling very euphoric about my new sober state and had an expandes love for life. I also had a lot of money and could finally buy whatever I wanted and wasn’t borrowing money each month without paying my debts to my friends.

After around a month, this feeling started to wear off and everything started feeling “normal” similar to how it felt when being high became my normal state. Maybe this is how it is, but that “high” was really helping me to not crave weed, and now I am left only with discipline (and the timer widget on my homescreen that I don’t want to reset, lol)

I'm new. Just joined this morning actually. 
I am excited because this group seems awesome!

I guess I just want to share my own situation, which may inspire someone, but also be therapeutic for me. 💗

I am almost 33. I started smoking around 15/16. I smoked my way through cosmetology school, smoked my way through my 20s and my pregnancies, and smoked my way through endless jobs. 

Recently, after starting my own business, I realized one of the reasons I was struggling was because I couldn't really ""think"". So, after going over it with my husband (veteran smoker himself), I decided I should quit. At first, I told myself ""it'll be a break. It's fine"". Then I decided to get more serious and tell myself it will be permanent. It's time to really grow up. So, I quit cold turkey, 25days, 11hours ago. LOL. I have this awesome tracker and I love it. 

At first the fog was gnarly. I also got my first vaccine on day 2 🤦🏼‍♀️ that was a bad decision lol. Around day 6 I started to come through the fog. A few days later though, back into it. Even 25 days in, I am still occasionally feeling foggy. I've started working out, almost every day, to provide myself with some mood boosting positivity. I also meditate at night and keep myself feeling positive with frequent reminders of being a badass. 

I have started dreaming again.. they are intense. Like, really intense. Insanely vivid and I can remember them all day. I was not prepared for how strong those would be. 

As someone who told myself for years that it was fine, and I didn't need to quit, it doesn't affect me.. yadda yadda. I'm so glad I quit. I feel like a new person. 
Plus, as it turns out, I am enjoying the clarity.

Ive been a daily smoker/dabber for about 3-4 years now (currently age 24) with only weed. I have worked the same full time job the past few years in a fast paced, high stress IT environment, and was wondering if anybody had some advice on how to not instantly walk through the door and grab the bowl/bong after work. Im tired of being exhausted all the time, and feeling okay with becoming a zombie in front of my computer screen when i get home from work, even though i have things i need to do around my house, and a cat to take care of. I feel like the excuse i use to smoke weed is to shut my brain off because ""ive been using it all day and i deserve a break"" Any help or advice is extremely appreciated. I look up to and respect anybody who is currently working at, or trying to build up the courage to quit. This isnt an easy thing to do (at least for me).

I started smoking weed 11y ago when I was in 10th grade, I'm now 29. I went through my whole adult life constantly high, for all this time I've been smoking everyday from the moment I woke up until going to sleep. I was smoking like 10 joints daily, just like people smoke cigars.

I'm now on my second day without weed and I don't know who I am, this is not me, every memory, every achievement I had were mixed with weed. Driver's license, graduation, college, career change, gf, family dinners, christmas... everything!

This is messing with my head, it's not the withdrawal symptoms nor the boredom, it's this sense of ""who tf is this guy???"" I can't remember who I was 11y ago, and even if I did I was just a kid, I would not be that person anymore, but the person I've been since then is this high chill guy and now that I stopped I don't know anymore.

I'm dropping the weed for sure, enough is enough, but I don't want to lose my ""personality"" in the process.

Sorry for the bad english, I just wanted to let this out, I don't know, maybe someone can relate.

UPDATE: I want to thank you all for your replies. I do mean it! Today was a rough day, I needed to let this out, and seeing all of your comments really helped.

It's 6:05 am. In the past, I'd walk out to my deck, shut the sliding door so hubby would keep sleeping and not hear me (HA ! he did....) and cough and hack for my wake and bake. Sometimes I'd cough so hard, I would throw up in the garden. Didn't stop me though ! I'd puke. Give a deep sigh. And pack a bowl and off we go !....

Even before I took my heart meds, I'd go about prepping my ""other meds"". I'd smoke outside in all weather in the morning hunkered over my lighter, sparking up. The tranquil surroundings of my 'hood have been shattered in all seasons, at all hours, by me GACKING. The lots are 50 - 60' apart - there is no way my neighbours haven't heard me coughing over the years. There's nothing else disturbing this early morning peace - except me.

This morning is Day 7 of quitting. I'm outside and it's so.... quiet. I can't believe how much I must have been disturbing this tranquility over the years. I think about how loud my coughs were, despite trying to 'tamp them down'. Everyone within about 1,000 yards must have heard me. Every single bloody day.

When I was in my early 20's, I lived in an apartment and the guy above me must have been a smoker because each morning, more regular than my alarm clock, I'd hear him coughing loud and harsh through the thin apartment walls. It got so I nicknamed him Mr. Hork. I used to laugh and think about how pathetic he was.... It is with sadness and regret I realize that over the last 15 years, I have turned into Mr. Hork.

My weed habit effected other people. It effected my neighbours. I'm sure they've awakened to the lyrical sounds of me coughing / puking up a lung over the years. All this is, of course, not even addressing the state of my lungs. Which I hope are healing as I type this.

If you'd told my 22yo self I'd turn into Mr. Hork one day, I would have been infinitely sad. This is so embarrassing.

So I thought I would write on this subreddit to kill an hour or two. I am 20y/o who lives in San Francisco. (weed culture is huge in San Francisco.) I started smoking regularly around late 9th or 10th grade. I didn't like weed the first few times I did it, but I remember going to the Haight, smoking a berry backwood with my friends, and heading to McDonald's, this was the first time I liked being high. I just felt a total euphoric feeling, and the McDonald's French fries just tasted sooooo much better than usual. Anyways, after this, I continue to buy more and more weed. The peak was two zips a week when I was in high school. When this got a little expensive, I switched to cartridges and smoked them daily. This was when I feel like I was abusing the drug. I would sit in my room all day, smoke my cart all day and just watch youtube videos. I felt my brain mushing up when I was in this phase, I was just too naive to understand what I was doing and the long-term effects. Back in my younger HS days, I remember I had very good memory, I was super motivated and, I always wanted to learn more. Now, especially a year or two ago, I am totally unmotivated to do anything good with my life, I was for a long time contempt working at a corner store making sandwiches all day. I always had an excuse to keep on smoking, at first it was "" I can't go to sleep without weed"" then it was ""Well what am I gonna do when the pandemic is going? I'll stop when the pandemic stops"" But every time I told myself I was going to stop, I would find myself driving to the dispensary at 9pm last minute, just so I could get high. I would pay stupidly high delivery fees, just so I could smoke that night and sit in my room all day. I know I have more problems than just weed, I have a lot of social anxiety to the point where I can't speak at all in front of people, and etc. But I do think weed played a big part in me being unmotivated and especially my memory. Don't let this fool you, I feel pretty positive you can have a healthy relationship with cannabis, but I am unfortunately not strong-minded enough to do that. This is day 2 of me quitting cannabis, and my worst fear was not being able to fall asleep, but my first night I had to force my eyes closed and shut my mind off for 30 minutes, but after that, I was out cold. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and I am ready to go on longer. I just don't see myself quitting forever, I just like it too much still. I just want to stop right now to get my life together, because I am behind all my friends, it really hits you when all your friends are going to college, having fun, going on super cool trips, and I'm here watching their snapchats while I make sandwiches for 8 hours a day, then go home and smoke my brains out until it's bedtime, then do it all again.

It doesn’t have to be complicated. Bullet points work. Pictures work, if drawing communicates a mood better. If you haven’t tried journaling I highly recommend it. 

Those of you dealing with vivid dreams/ nightmares - it’s good to grab a notebook and jot them down so you can sort them out in the morning. 

Those who are dealing with triggers- you can track them and look for patterns and connections, and perhaps find some meaningful insight. 

If you have unresolved anger issues (oooh ! That’s me!) it’s a great place to vent, curse, write unspeakable things and just get it out. 

There’s only one caveat: you need to write it old school style. With paper. And a pen. Typing a journal is not as effective as hand writing your thoughts. There’s studies that show the neural connections that take place between your eye and hand and the physical act of writing, embeds learning more deeply than typing or using an app. 

I look back on old journals and they never fail to enlighten  -  frequently I get big ah ha’s literally months or years afterwards.

Everything has been glorious after the initial anxiety/crying spells/etc. and moved into a recovery focused lifestyle. 

A little weird though, my appetite has increased exponentially and I have put on maybe 10lbs of weight in the last 4 months that do not seem related to my workouts. It’s a little weird to me when I read that people are losing weight after they quit because I always experienced appetite suppression and ate pretty healthy when I smoked. These days I feel like I can’t stop eating! Maybe it’s the oral fixation replacement?

I’d been using consistently for about 4 years, always knowing I needed to quit at some point but unsure what would motivate me to actually just stop.  Turns out not being able to breath was what did it.  It was honestly the worst feeling ever.  Once I quit I went through the withdrawals (night sweats, crazy dreams, feeling like shit, etc.), but once that was done I still couldn’t breath.  Long story short I couldn’t breath for months and turns out I have asthma (which still sucks but some meds are making it better).  I’d always liked weed because I could smoke it after work and get nice and chill, but then go to sleep and get up the next morning to work out.

Since it was asthma that made me quit, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to have some edibles every once in a while...which of course turned into near daily use.  I found, though, that I’d get the weed hangovers the next day and just felt generally shitty - much worse than when I smoked.  Plus the high wasn’t as good - at all.  

So now I stopped using again,and my breathing is better, but I feel so anxious maybe? It’s actually not anxiety I feel but more restlessness...like I’m not tired at night, I’m bored at work and throughout the day (covid isn’t helping), and just want to do SOMETHING but not sure what.

I often tend to do big-picture thinking when it comes to setting a goal or changing my behaviour. 
I may imagine grand goals and achievements, such as a month of not getting high, or even a year. 

However, usually being stuck on day 0, I kind of get overwhelmed by the idea of quitting, so I end up stressed, tired and relapsing. 

But if I just focus on today or tomorrow, review my tasks for the day, organize my time and have some sort of plan for the day (even if it might not be an accurate plan), I find that it makes it easier for me to decide not to get high this day. 

I'm not sure on the official science on this, but when I take some time in the day, after waking up - to plan and organize my time for the day, and before going to bed - to evaluate how the day went and what has been achieved, I'm not so overwhelmed, I'm not so stressed out.

I have been doing so much research and attended a few online Marijuana Anonymous meetings and listening to the people and speaking about the physical impact that marijuana has had on their immune system, nervous system, other organs etc... is the reality check I needed that I have sabotaged myself in more ways than one by choosing to be a daily smoker on and off for more than half my life - I am now 29 years old.

The reality of never picking it up again is so daunting but also a relief at the same time? There are a very ""light"" physical ailments that I have been experiencing that I had tested for other things such as hyperthyroidism etc and I could never figure out what may be the cause... with all the medical research I have been doing, I recognize now that it is a very good chance that it is connected to my marijuana addiction.

I am not one for cognitive dissonance - if I am presented with information that contradicts my beliefs, I do not shy away from it - I welcome it as an opportunity for growth. Nonetheless, the truth is painful. 

As I mentioned in a previous post - when I moved to the USA almost 2 years ago, I was welcomed with a potency of marijuana that my body never knew before. It is the first time I am experiencing physical withdrawals from quitting. 

My skin is itching like crazy, my temperature regulation is whack, my skin looks terrible, I am miserable, tired, nauseas, I have a headache, I am so irritable, frustrated, my libido is nowhere to be found, food isn't fun, all my body's old aches are coming back from old martial arts injuries, lacking motivation, shoulders feel achy and heavy.

I have smoked weed since middle school, every single day. I am now well into my 20s. I haven’t been able to eat, sleep, or socialize without it- just like many of you. It was not uncommon for me to buy an ounce of ZAZA for $350+ and burn the entire thing in a weekend, to the face, just to do it again. It’s safe to say my entire life has revolved around the consumption of the devil’s lettuce. 

I am now 3 days sober and never plan on smoking again. Allow me to share some advice I’ve been learning from a book called Atomic Habits. If you always see yourself as a stoner trying to quit smoking, it will be very difficult. If you see yourself as someone who simply lives a sober lifestyle, it becomes much easier. You are not your vices or crutches. You are you, the same person you were before you were high all the time, and you can and will easily return to that form. 

Another thing I learned is the importance of systems. Setting a goal ultimately is placing far too much emphasis on one thing that you may or may not accomplish. A far more efficient approach is changing your *systems*. Find out everything that makes it hard for you not to smoke weed, and work on eliminating them. Certain places, people, music make you desperately want to puff the magic dragon? Time to cut those things out. Work on slowly replacing them with all the things you daydream about while your stoned to the bizzone. I PROMISE that your brain is not broken, and ultimately not only will things return to normal- they will be far better.

If you are on this sub you want to quit for a reason. I have plenty. You gotta actively keep those reasons in mind- and on top of that trust me when I say you will quickly begin seeing benefits that you didn’t even think possible. 

Join me, readers of r/leaves, it’s time to emerge from the hazy fog of cannabis intoxication and begin living the kinds of lives that we can truly be content with.

3 other tips you’ve probably heard before:

•Make it extremely hard on yourself to relapse. Block your plug, tell all your friends you’re quitting, throw away all paraphernalia. 

•”Streak”, meaning tally every day that you’ve successfully accomplished what you set out to do. Keeping count of $ saved isn’t a bad idea either, although in my case it’s so much that I don’t even have to.

•Don’t sleep on the high you get from a solid run etc, it definitely hits.",15,0

(This is kind of long, and a bit of a ramble. Stream of consciousness kind of stuff. Just some observations and a bit of my own story)

I cant remember if I've ever posted here, but I have commented. Replied to a few posts today infact, and decided I wanted to put my own experience down here as well.

A couple years back I finally decided to quit. I was a heavy smoker, as many of us are. Pretty much constantly smoking, high all the time type. I loved it of course, as many of us do. Didn't see any need to quit, and couldnt imagine why I would ever want to. EVERYTHING is better high...right?

Of course thats bullshit, and the first time I quit, I was still believing it. I was sort of 'forced' to quit due to circumstances. Basically my friend and I had a bit of a falling out, and he was the one I bought off of. It was a really good situation, he was a good dude, always gave me front when I needed it, never ripped me off or pushed if I owed him money for a bit. Of course, business is business but he was a good dude about it. We had some issues though (unrelated to weed) and we stopped talking. Of course over the years I had known many dealers but for one reason or another they or I moved on and I lost touch, or what not. So now there I was, no dealer, no real other social network, no other friends that smoked at the time..I was an island unto myself. Couple that with really bad anxiety and other issues and there just didnt seem to be a way to find another hook up.

I panicked at first of course. I was the type of guy who would start flipping out if I had to go one single day without weed. It would just get to me and I would be a mess. But my 'pride' sort of kicked in around then. I didnt want someone else (or something else) to have that kind of hold on me. I was real mad at my friend and felt he was really in the wrong for the reason we fell out, and I didnt want to give him that ""power"" over me. Even if he didnt know it. So I just said Fuck it....I quit.

It worked. Somehow or another it worked. It wasnt easy...but it was, easier? I guess, then I thought it would be. I was lucky...that pride thing really helped move me forward and I refused to show weakness, even if no one could see it. The support of my girlfriend helped of course, even she was blown away by it. She seems to think I have some knack for dropping addictions cause I was able to quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey a couple years before that. It wasnt easy either, but I suppose its just about a certain mindset sometime. I felt cigarettes was easier though because at that point I was truly getting nothing from them. ....I'm getting off topic though...

So that first time lasted around 6 months, but eventually one day I was bored enough, knew I had a cart sitting around the house somewhere that had a few hits left, and you can guess how that went. One good thing that came out of it though was I did repair my relationship with my friend (needed that hook up again)...but we did actually repair our actual friendship as well.

I ended up moving to another state not long after that, and thankfully(well i was thankful at the time) I was able to find a new hookup in the new state. Been smoking regularly since then. Until certain health issues started coming up, and I finally decided to address them, as well as my mental health. The weed started to become a major problem for me, and wasnt helping at all. I couldnt enjoy it, but I couldnt stop, and I was craving those days from years ago when I was sober, and everything was alright, and I could still laugh and still listen to music and still enjoy everything. I would just actually remember it afterwards lol.

So last wednesday, I was prescribed a medication for my anxiety/depression. Nothing too serious, but I knew I couldnt be smoking if I was going to be taking a medication for my mental health. It would interfere too much, I wouldnt know if it was actually working, etc etc. That was all I needed. Its been a week, 8 days I guess since I last smoked. I've been lucky? sort of in that my other issues are distracting me from any weed craving, and I'm almost afraid to smoke. That makes it easier to not give in for sure. I wish circumstances were better and I could do it 100% as my own decision, but we get there how we get there.

I had my first dream 2 nights ago. First dream in god knows how long. Actual, full on, remember it in the morning, cinematic fuckin dream lol. It was rough, I cried in it. It was crazy. Last night, same thing, crazy dream where I ended up crying in it. But it felt SO fucking good. I was excited as hell to go to bed last night knowing I'd probably dream again. Woke up happy that I did, even if the dream itself was stressful. What a feeling.

You really dont know how bad weed affects your sleep as a heavy user until you stop. Its so bad for your overall health and I'm already feeling better knowing I've reclaimed that part of my life.

Dont know who needed to hear this, but I hope it helps someone. I hope someone can relate. If youre struggling, or not sure if you really want to quit, trust me. Give it a shot, stay the course. Life gets a lot better on this side of things",9,0
1325,2021-05-06 14:15:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/n6dq3e/day_6/,Day 6,"Today is Day 6 after a decade of use and a few years of daily use. 

So far, I haven’t had many strong urges to use again, but I am dealing with the nasty withdrawal symptoms like lack of sleep, sweating like crazy, lack of appetite, and some odd mood swings. 

For those looking to make the leap, here’s what’s working and what’s not, to help you on your journey. 

What’s not working:
- I tried to eat normally after, but even the smell of most foods I enjoy is making me feel sick. This is starting to pass on day 6, but those first 5 days were rough. I’m still super picky with what I can eat, but it’s improving a bit. 
- expecting to sleep the first few nights. I used pot to sleep, and without it I was feeling really lost. Instead of trying to sleep normally, I just stayed up like I would if I was using and let my body start to come back to a normal cycle. Night 5 was the closest to normal yet, but it’s taking time. 

What has worked:
- having a strong reason to quit, writing it down, and looking at it often
- transitioning from smoking to edibles before I quit. For 2 months I only used edibles. This forced me to get used to not having that immediate-release feeling that I craved, while still having pot available. It’s made the last 6 days much more manageable since I’m not watching a clock, or itching for a quick fix. 
- getting rid of all my stuff the day I quit. Now I have to actually go buy more if I want to give in, and I’m stubborn enough not to do that. 
- taking some time off work. I feel like hot garbage, and being able to sleep lots and not worry about work performance has reduced my anxiety a lot. 
- having a counsellor. I came into this with strategies ready and someone I can call for support and someone to keep me accountable. I almost blew past my end-date because I was getting nervous but a little tough-love from him got me back on track and got me to throw it all out on my date. 
- telling family/friends. Not many people even knew about my use, but the ones that did know about my quitting. Telling them adds to the accountability. 
- reading everyone’s stories here and sharing my thoughts on this group. This group has had more impact that I can put into words. Everyone has been so open with their experiences and have given me so much to relate to. I’ve been able to help a few fellow travellers in a moment of need, and been able to reach out for the same myself. 
- having a loving, supportive partner who knows where I am every step of the way. I’m lucky enough to have a wife who loves me immensely, see’s what I’m going through and supports me in so many ways. She’s even started reading this group to understand more and walk this path with me :) (If you’re reading this my love, THANK YOU!!!). My counsellor said the opposite of addiction is connection, and he was right. I ask for hugs when I need them, and she’s been amazing at taking care of me through this transition. 

Thank you all for sharing your insights and I hope mine help someone, like yours have for me! 

It’s not a fun path, but it’s temporary. I look forward to the day the fog clears fully and I can enjoy life without pot again. I know that day is coming and I’ll share when it comes! 

If you have any questions, feel free to msg me and I’m happy to share. 

Good luck everyone!",6,0

I’ve lost so much weight that I can fit in clothes from my freshman year of high school. I never know when I should sleep even if I know I’ve obligations the next day. The memories that should be special are now oversaturated as hanging out with my friends now only consists exclusively of smoking. Nothing feels special or worthwhile anymore and I haven’t felt any specific emotion other than frustration and sadness at my own habits. I resent the person I am so very much and I want to take steps towards bettering myself but I’m so scared. I’ve opened Pandora’s box and sometimes I wonder if I can actually shut it, or if everything will seem this bleak always.

By strong, I mean most resistant to rationalization / weaseling my way around. For example, I enjoy a clear mind from sobriety but if my temptation rises too high I say to myself that the clear mind will be back later and that some reason makes it ok to smoke. Self-compassion is different.

Self-compassion means wishing the best for myself as I would a child. I would never consider giving weed to a child or to anyone else to help them calm down, get motivated (lol) or get through a tough time. It's just not compassionate to sow chaos, lethargy, and dependence into someone's life.

In past attempts quitting, I always held on to my weed gear because of sentimental attachment. ""This guy has been with me through some hard times,"" I thought. The thought of abandoning it felt like a betrayal against an old friend. I even felt the same way about my goddamn grinder haha.

But this just shows how deeply weed rooted itself in my brain. The pipe is an inanimate object. A chunk of glass that performed a function for me. I might as well develop an attachment to my cereal bowl because that was there for me through those same exact hard times as well, holding my cereal for me every morning. But if I dropped and smashed an old cereal bowl, I wouldn't even think twice about it.

The only reason I kept it before was because I subconsciously didn't want to give up the possibility of using it to get high all the time again. A last resort ""bail-out plan"" to return to my warm, hazy, but suffocating safety blanket if times got tough. Which I ended up doing again every single time.

The world is a crazy place and to hold on to all that negative energy was so toxic. I was holding on to some serious anger and frustration for people and things in my life and didn't have the confidence to point at anyone/thing but myself.  In any case, I'm going to take way better care of myself going forward and not get into those same situations. I have the confidence to say no to things and to take space for myself.

Eventually, I did go back to smoking a lot of weed (I've had a bad habit where I'll smoke a lot for 4-6 weeks, and then abstain for around a month, and so on. However, every time I become sober, after some point of time—usually either the first week or fourth week, but randomly as well—I notice that my mind starts deviating from wanting to remain sober and starts thinking thoughts like ""You could smoke...it's just so nice outside and it's a rare opportunity to hang out with everyone"" or ""Imagine how fun it would be to be stoned with everyone today...""

Time for my yearly check in I guess now. As you can see, I don't frequent or use reddit as much as I did before, but the other day I realized that it had almost been 3 years since I stopped smoking weed and I just wanted to check back in and let everyone know how it is going.

So, a lot of stuff has happened.

Work, going a LOT better than before. Increased focus. Increased drive. Increased motivation.

MENTAL FOG is much better. Again, it directly correlates with sleep, diet, and sleep...did I mention sleep? Quality sleep?

I listened to a Podcast about the importance of sleep and I realized that for around 10 years when I was smoking weed, I never got high quality sleep. For me, my mental fog lasted for over 2 years after quitting weed, to varying degrees.

Now, after 3 years, I really am noticing a difference with my mental fog and my ability to live in a clear head space.

Personal life? I mean, other than being locked down still (Canadian) and being in worse shape than before (gyms closed and locked down...Canadian life) I have a great relationship that I am present for. I just bought a house. I've saved a lot more money than previously.

First of all thank you to all those who make this community what it is! This place is so inspiring and supportive 

I’m 28f and have been smoking almost daily for around 5 years. Some years wouldn’t be daily but that’s all apples and oranges. I’ve wanted to give up weed for a while now but due to depression, a traumatic upbringing and turbulent home life I have used weed as a clutch. It numbs the vividness of the pain so to speak. However over the last year or two I have started to not even enjoy the high. The thought of weed has now become sweeter than the actual high for me. Yet I still continue to buy and smoke almost on autopilot. 

I’ve now been off weed for 7 days and each day I wake up I feel a difference in my energy and spirit. I feel like sunlight is shining on me a little more each day. 

Yes there’s still urges and the boredom / guilt of wasted years and opportunities makes me want to pick up again BUT I refuse to be a slave to this substance any longer. Even though the sunlight shining through at the moment is small I have a feeling and hope that if I continue each day, soon I can fully bask in it.

Some things I’ve learnt so far are...

- weed makes me feel worse and more depressed.
- weed pauses me whilst the whole world keeps moving 
- weed is a waste of my energy and lowers my vibrations 
- weed makes me anti social and insecure. There have been times I’ve smoked in social settings and literally feel like I can’t talk, people don’t like me etc 
- weed can’t heal me or help me.
- I am a addict to the numb feeling it provides but life is to be lived in full vividness - pain included.

Why watch a film in black and white when you can watch its full array of colours? Even if some of those colours aren’t my favourite, it’s better than seeing none at all...

I still struggle and I fear at 28 I’ve lost out on a lot, my upbringing has been hard to put it lightly and weed provided the pain relief I felt I needed for so long. The problem is, the pain is still here the second I stop smoking. 

It masks it does not mend.

So I make this post now to say to myself I deserve better. If I want to grow and find peace then I have to be present. 

Whoever is here reading this, you are not alone. Let’s do our best to fight through together day by day. Each day more sunlight will come (and maybe some days it won’t) but I refuse to stay hidden in the darkness x",27,1

I was going to get groceries and waiting on the train platform for the subway to arrive, and of course I had my vape pen with me and had been hitting it since I left my apartment. And for the whole day before that, who am I kidding. At that point it was literally inconceivable for me to go do an errand without being sky high. 

The train arrived, and I looked up as I was stepping in through the door, and I made eye contact with one of my old bosses, standing just a couple feet away in the train. Or at least I think it was. As I mentioned, I was sky high, and definitely paranoid. 

So instead of saying something, or waving, or even just getting on the train and doing nothing, I stopped in my tracks like a baked deer in the headlights, and slowly and awkwardly turned around to go get on another train car. Seeing him really surprised me and the thought of talking to him while I was so stoned was terrifying. 

I really looked up to this guy. He was incredibly smart and nice, and taught me a lot of what I know about my field. If it was him, he probably now thinks that I hate him. And it still really bothers me and gives me a mild panic attack whenever I think about it. 

To this day, I still don’t know if it was him. He has facial hair and glasses, and I hadn’t seen him for 5+ years at the time, so it could have been someone else. Obviously I hope it wasn’t him. But if it was, I either looked like a fucking psycho, or someone who was trying to avoid him at all costs.

Anyone else have an embarrassing stoner moment?",4,0

Later in the night (a few hrs ago) I decided to order weed delivery. Loaded up my cart and pressed order and I immediately regretted it.

I think the medical profession is coming round to acknowledging weed withdrawal but how they missed this for so long, I have no idea.

I'm currently take a break as I have an insurance application medical coming up. I know that I'll still fail the urine test but I told them I take cannabis, so I'm not too worried about the fail.

I'm on day 4 and let me tell you, day 3 was incredibly rough. I'm a pretty frequent consumer but I try and take a day off every third day or so. Reading some of the posts and comments here about how cannabis controls your mental state was really eye opening. It probably would be good to give it up completely but at this stage of my life, I think I need it. I've got two young kids and I never get a minute to myself, unless I'm on the crapper, and even then, they come in sometimes! Weed gives me an outlet that is manageable and happy and fairly controlled. 

Anyway, I need to talk about yesterday, day 3, cause I don't know if I've felt this bad ever, and I just need to write it somewhere. I don't want to talk to my wife about this. 

Yesterday started ok. I haven't been sleeping well the last few nights so a bit tired but manageable. Work was pretty busy, especially the end of the day, and I was on work calls all afternoon. I had a late call from 5.30pm to 6pm and then I had to take my kid to soccer practice. This is where things started going downhill.

My assumption was my wife would have my kid ready for soccer. Nope. I started running round the house looking for his gear, kid said he didn't want to go, had to deal with that, couldn't find the car keys. Forgot our masks. Got to soccer and realised it was colder and windier than I had expected and we were both not wearing warm enough clothes. At least my kid could run around to stay warm. I froze my ass off for an hour. 

At soccer, there is an asshole kid who picks on my kid. Hits him, kicks him. My kid is too dumb to stay away from him and is always goofing around, so he's an easy target for that kid. The lack of control I have over this situation and my frustration makes me crazy at the best of times. Last night, I went over to my kid and loudly said ""I told you to stay away from that kid and not talk to him"". The asshole kid looks at me and I said ""yeah, you. I'm watching!"" The next time he went to mess with my kid, he looked over at me and I glared at him. He quit after that. Next time / next step, I'm talking to the dad. I'll try and be polite.

I took my kid for ice cream because he tried at soccer this week. Normally he doesnt, and this was a bribe that seemed to work. 

I got home and my dinner was nowhere near ready. This was about 2 hours after normal dinner time, and I was starving. My wife was reorganizing the kitchen the whole time I was gone apparently. My h-anger levels were insane at this point. I tried to keep it under control. My kid made such a mess of his ice cream that I took him up for a shower. This is where I kinda lost control. 

He wouldn't stop fucking around so I grabbed him by the arm and took him to the bathroom. I'd given him 3 warnings but I was a bit rough, and I regretted it almost instantly, despite my rage. My mother in law is visiting, she came up and tagged me out which was a good idea. 

I took my other kid up and gave him a bath. This kid is easier and that went better. But by this point, I was drained, hungry, feeling depressed and actually had a couple of very dark thoughts about my life. I texted a friend and said ""sometimes I hate life"", and he got worried. Some texts with him calmed me down. I read a book to kid #2 and snuggled with him, and that reminded me that it's not all bad. I got kid #2 down and then I went into kid #1 and said goodnight.

After that, dinner was ready. I ate dinner in silence cause I just didn't want to talk. After dinner I went up to bed to do some more work on my laptop. And then I went to bed. I've slept like crap all night and this fucking medical is at 7am. At this point, I'm ready to cancel the fucking application. My readings are bound to be fucked after this zero sleep night. 

This withdrawal shit is no joke. I'm sure no one will read all that crap above but just writing it here was therapeutic for me, so I'm grateful for r/leaves being here for me to do that.

I've been lurking on this sub for a couple of years, and I'm finally posting. I won't go into my full story, but to sum it up:

I began smoking in high school around the age of 17, and during college, my usage got ramped up exponentially. Over the last 3 years at college, my usage was nearly daily, with countless quitting attempts along the way. At this point, I've accepted that I am an addict and it's time for me to truly start living my life.

I'm now 22 years old and I'm tired of being tired. I have been stuck in this daily loop for 2-3 years now and it's broken me down much more than I ever could have anticipated. As I said, I've tried countless times before to quit weed, but it never seemed to stick. However, this time is much different.

I've kept my addiction a secret forever, and that's probably the reason it was so easy for me to fall back into the habit. You probably know what it's like, if you have nobody to hold you accountable might as well just light up another joint right? Why not?

This time is different though. I **finally** managed to tell people about my addiction and desire to quit. I opened up to my dad, my closest friends that I used to smoke with, and my girlfriend. I am so extremely lucky because they all were understanding and supportive.

I really do feel like this time is going to stick, thanks to the support from the people around me, and this community as well. I'm planning to post every day, mainly as a form of therapy and to act as a journal for myself, and who knows, maybe it will help others as well.

I'm currently about to get into bed **sober** for the first time in months.

I'm **scared** and **nervous** of what's to come over the next few weeks.

But most of all, I'm **excited** to truly start my life and begin accomplishing my goals and living in the present.

Thanks for reading, I will be posting again tomorrow, goodnight!

(15 days sober after moderate use),"Overall, I’m doing much better. I will not go back. I feel well. Something happened today though. I woke up and felt completely empty. My body feels lighter, and when working out today, pain was less of an obstacle. I can now see all my thoughts so clearly, but everything else feels distant. What I’m not certain is if this is solipsism, anhedonia, derealization, or something else. I have smiled and laughed, and I’m feeling good emotions - so maybe not anhedonia. Solipsism, maybe part of it. Derealization, most likely. I am not connected. It is surreal, and something I thought that was exclusive to the occasional bad trip. No anxiety, no strong emotions, just feeling like a small player in a virtual world. I cannot tell if it is frightening or freeing, temporary or permanent. 

[*If you have reached this point, you have read the meat of the post. Thanks. From here I will blabber for the sake of keeping my thumbs and mind busy.]*

I am sensitive to changes in my state of consciousness. I will ruminate on it until I get hungry, thirsty, or have to use the restroom. I remember trying so solve all sorts of problems in the shower when I was a kid. I would think of how I might cure diabetes (I was a stupid fucking kid and had no clue), save my family from an apocalypse, and what I would do in the time before the apocalypse. I was obsessed with it from 7-14 years of age. I firmly believed I would never live past 15. Somtimes I would picture a giant space object blocking the planet, then an intense heat vaporizing me and my family in agony. Exposure to the reality of Hiroshima and Nagasaki + too much history channel as a curious kid are factors. Genetics are, too. And but when I told my parents about my fear at the age of 8, they told me there was nothing we could do about it - the apocalypse - and that made me lose some hope. My parents are also obsessive; always fixated on some silly idea but too neurotic to think it through with enough care. They end up cutting corners and acting impulsively. It can be exhausting. Reminds me of a hamster running in a wheel except the hamster at least gets some exercise. 

Somehow, I feel like this fragmented history I put together captures a small piece of what led me to be prone to addiction. Another piece may have to do with exposure to *constant* - no joke - absolutely *constant* pessimism as a kid. It shaped how I viewed people, formed relationships, navigated school and work, and could not connect with trust, respect, or belief in anything with any depth. Pessimism bias is exhausting and super toxic, and not just internally. It affects the people around you. Over time you learn to keep your mouth shut when you realize you see the world in a way the upsets people. It is unattractive, and it can be isolating. Resorting to pessimism is one habit that may be harder to break than a cannabis dependence",6,0

The first two weeks were a bit tough, I didn't have much of an appetite which sorta helped with my cut at the gym. But this past week has been full of worrisome thoughts and feelings of anxiousness, feeling like the world was going to end, and thinking irrationally. I even cried on the phone with a few of my close friends and family members, feeling bad for myself and thoughts of low self-esteem. These feelings are awful. I started meditating yesterday which allowed me to feel more calmer. This evening my thoughts have slowed down and I'm feeling more grounded and stable in my mind. The funny thing is that I'm a fairly strong and self confident person, with or without weed. But without the drug I have feelings if uselessness, negative thoughts that don't add up. 

Unfortunately there's no drug that will fix the anxiety from not smoking weed, I googled it. All roads lead me to posts on r/leaves, which helped a tonne.

It’s interesting to think about how the experience of quitting affects women and men differently. I think for moms, there is so much more pressure to keep everything together mood-wise and stay connected and attuned to the kids.

Wow - it has been such an incredibly comforting feeling finding this space to relate, connect and express myself.

I am now 29 years old. I started smoking marijuana when I was living in Brasil at 14 but I would smoke weed once every couple months so it was never really a thing for me until I moved back home to South Africa at 18. It was purely a social thing for me but I indulged more regularly than my early teens. 

Then at age 24, I met a guy who I was immediately infatuated with that made THC oil as his side gig and he was permanently stoned. He moved in with me and all of a sudden I had permanent access to marijuana in many forms. I was a daily user from morn til night from ages 24-26 until we broke up. It really never felt like a dependency for me because the THC content was so low and I was truly functioning totally fine. 

Quitting was not hard for me at all and I had a good 4 months sober when I met my husband who is a verrry occasional smoker. I started up again but would only smoke a couple times a week in social settings.

The problems arose when I moved back to the USA with my now husband in 2019. We were actually sober for 7 months upon moving here while he was busy with his greencard process (he wasn't sure if he would be drug tested) and we had no problem being sober at all.

When I did smoke weed for the first time being back here in December 2019, the THC levels were like nothing I had experienced. It is so potent here and I found myself experiencing a zombie-like dependent state which I had never experienced with marijuana before. The high was like vegetative and numbing. This coupled with the stress I was experiencing with my husband's green card process (which is finally done) and then the pandemic hitting and working fully online, I found myself smoking all day and during the night when I couldn't sleep. If I went just 6 hours without it, I would feel like I was withdrawing (would experience irritation, short temper, groggy, grumpy, not present, anxious, disassociation, trouble sleeping, serious lack of motivation etc)

In general I am a fit person and I partake in martial arts and I am a functional movement instructor - I totally fell off the bandwagon of moving my body when my marijuana addiction overtook everything at the start of quarantine.

By the way, my husband is not like me. He smokes the tiniest bit a couple times a week whereas I would smoke the fattest bowls to get as f&$%ed up as I possibly can on marijuana to numb myself all day every day.

We then moved to another state last October and I was sober for a couple weeks no problem - I think all the excitement of moving to a new place distracted me from any withdrawals I may have had.

This time is different though. I now have 24 hours and I am so irritated. I am nauseas, irritated, restless, short tempered and I just want to be anywhere but in my body. I am really struggling. I recognize I have been so depressed the last year and not having my crutch is really allowing the reality of my life to set in. This last year feels like a dream and I felt so numb for most of it.

My husband is an amazing support and is also stopping for now while I am in this transitional period of gaining control over my life again. It is very easy for him to just put it down. He doesn't self medicate whereas I do.

I do not want to start a program or anything like that - I just want to get over this hump and regulate my nervous system so I can get back to a clear mind. I recognize now that the marijuana here is just not what I am used to and I crossed a slippery slope with self medicating which I cannot wait to get out of. And close this chapter of my life.

Just wanted to express my experience and I am so grateful for the resources to connect with others in the same boat. Wishing everyone the best!",8,2

I felt super stressed when I was smoking because I spent half my money on weed and then felt financially and emotionally unstable.

My girlfriend wants to go to an expensive chic restaurant for lunch near her house. It’s kind of an anxiety trigger for me because last time I spent money there I had no job and no savings and I maxed out my credit card. 

I have since paid off my credit card debt from that trip but I still feel anxious about going there. 

Should I give in, buy lunch, and hope for the best or tell her that it makes me anxious and go somewhere else?

I think I’m just going to buy lunch.

I was a chronic weed smoker from the ages 18-24. It got so bad to the point when I was smoking an ounce every two weeks when I was 21, and then an ounce every week when I was 22/23. I quit smoking January of this year (2021) because I wanted to get my life and emotions together, but am having some serious worries now that I’m about 4 months sober.

I know I can’t turn back time and it’s too late now if there really is any permanent damage.

Negative symptoms so far:

* Brain fog. I'll be in the middle of something like making dinner, reading an article, or in a conversation, and I'll just completely blank out. If I was planning to chop an onion and then throw it in the pan, I will chop it, but then literally not know what to do with the onion for a few moments. My memory was definitely shit when I was stoned all the time, but this is different. Before, I would forget to respond to texts, or forget a plot line of a movie or something. But this is more like a moment-to-moment shutting down, where my brain doesn't know which circuit to use next. Another example was yesterday in the supermarket when I was trying to think about which item I needed next and literally couldn't do it, or decide which way to walk. I just stood there stressed for a minute, turning different directions trying to figure it out.
* Insomnia. I'm fortunately able to get to sleep pretty easily so far, but can't stay asleep for more than a couple hours. At which point I'll just lay there with my mind racing and trying unsuccessfully to relax. Fortunately I haven't gotten many disturbing dreams yet, like I have with previous times quitting. Although I'm not counting on that nice trend continuing. The lack of sleep is likely contributing to the brain fog.
* Irritability. Little things that I would have let slide previously when I was high now bother me. Like someone cutting me off in traffic makes my blood boil and stresses me out, so I have to tell myself to calm down. Also, thinking of past negative events will irritate me. I had a previous terrible boss that always made me feel stupid and small. Now I can't stop thinking about how much I hated him, and will wish that I had told him off to his face or something when I had the chance.
* General stress level. Kinda related to the irritability. If I'm trying to do something simple like pay a bill online, and run into a minor setback, I'll get this overwhelmed feeling like I'm never going to be able to do it, and my instinct is just to go back to the couch to mindlessly browse reddit or watch tv. This is definitely impacting my overall productivity level, which wasn't great in the first place due to being stoned all the time. But when I was stoned, I could just kinda go into autopilot and get basic tasks done pretty well.
* Not enjoying things I would normally enjoy. Playing video games for example just doesn't have the same appeal and I also like woodworking and gardening. But those things just aren't appealing to me at the moment and doing them would feel like a chore.
* Lack of appetite/nausea. It's strange. I will physically get really hungry and think I want to eat, because my stomach is empty and rumbling. But then I'll get some food, take a few bites, and then feel completely full. And all of a sudden the food seems a bit revolting and I have to force myself to continue taking bites and swallowing them. Ultimately I'm eating a lot less than normal because it's impossible to force the food down past a certain point. I'm also usually very into spicy and strongly-flavored food, but it's just not appealing to me right now, and I can only eat bland food.
* Sighing. Not like a disappointed sigh, but like when you're near the end of a really super busy stressful day, and you just need to take a moment to refocus, and take a deep breath and exhale slowly. Except I'm getting that feeling and doing it at least every few minutes, especially when I'm trying to work on a task.
* Deja-vu. Not really a negative, but pretty strange and putting it here anyways. I'm getting very frequent spooky feelings of ""I've been here and done this exact thing in this exact same moment before.""

And I do actually have one positive thing to report:

* Improved functional memory. For specific information that I'm actually trying to remember. Last night I had to go over to a friend's house for dinner with my SO (everyone's vaccinated). I was really dreading it to be honest because of how crappy I felt all day, and because I was worried that people would comment on how little I was eating (fortunately they didn't). We all ended up playing a game after dinner called Monikers. I was in no mood to play, but didn't really have a choice, so I pushed through. This game has 3 rounds and relies pretty heavily on memorizing cards from the previous rounds. Previously I was always awful at this game, but actually did really well this time, and was able to memorize several cards that led to my team winning a game. That never would have happened before because I'd be too stoned. Ultimately the game was actually a really nice distraction and kept my mind off how crappy I felt.

Today my plan is to just keep trying to do tasks or hobbies even though I don't really feel like it. Because it does help to keep my mind off wanting to smoke again just to focus on something. Also going to try to get some exercise because I've heard that helps to get the dopamine flowing in an addicted brain again.",22,0

I’m tried of hiding only for a little toke that will last about an hour and make me feel like shit the rest of the day knowing that I won’t get that high that I want again. I’m tired of not trusting in myself anymore. I’m tired of playing this junkie game which has made me forget about who I am and all the beautiful things that I could accomplish in my life. 

I hope that one day I’ll be able to look back and realize how lost I was. Ain’t no drug, plant or any external source is gonna give us the self love that we need and deserve.

Alright here I go, I've reached 100 days and man its been rollercoaster. Never felt such lows before but I can happily say its gotten easier. I feel healthier and more productive. I read more, I meditate and I gym. But id be lying if I said the thought of smoking up again hasn’t started creeping back into my head lately. Anyway, I remember my first couple weeks where I was desperate to read other peoples posts to see if I could get like a general timeline and I also remember saying to myself Id make one of those posts if I ever got there. Well here it is, although it ain't much.   
 1st week: Lots and lots of nausea. Literally couldn’t eat anything, spent most days in bed and felt my mind slowly deteriorating. Had my first full blown panic attack on day three. I remember crying to mum and my gf a lot. (I’m M26 btw).

2nd week: still just as nauseous, but now my mental state had reached a new low. Cried a lot but more so I just had depression-like symptoms. Started meditating and going on walks. Also drank a lot of smoothies and tea. I think I’d lost like 6kg from when I stopped.

3rd week: I fled my home to my gfs and quit my part time job. Luckily, I could still study online but I did need to postpone assignments and exams. Still felt depression-like symptoms. 

4th week: more of the same but I should say the lows weren’t as low and my stomach started working slowly.

5th week: this was the week things started to turn around. I remember having my first full good day feeling satisfied. 

6th week onwards: As the days went on things got more normal. I started to feel like myself again, I slowly introduced foods to my diet, I continued walking and meditating. I keep like a mood journal where I can see how I felt after each day and there’s a clear upward trend in “happiness” as the weeks went on. 

As of last week I’m now back to my original house continuing my masters. Thought I’d really messed myself up but with a lot of trial and error, sheer will to get better, and a good supportive cast I think I can say im healthy again. BUT, like I said before, the thought of smoking here does creep up on me on occasion, more so the last 2-3 days, so im trying to stay vigilant. I should say I realized the reason I was in a shitty mindset wasn’t only weeds fault, I think I had to deal with personal stressors and weed just amplified it. To the people starting off now, I know it feels like it’ll never end, the nausea or the anxiety, and while im not a psychologist I do think its fair to say nothing in life lasts forever.

In the beginning weed was as all of you know something new, exiting and fun, atleast that was our impression of it. For me it largely remained that way, I never was heavy daily smoker, I only smoked on the weekends and at parties with my fellow stoners. We smoked on sunny cliffs, in beautiful forests and on god forsaken cold benches while freezing out balls of in the middle of winter. Anyway I come from a semi bad area, it was and is still dominated by middle class families such as mine, but alot of what should I call it ""gangsters"" who dealt drugs, robbed people and shit as that existed. I saw them and even hung out with some of them and saw the shit they were in and so my ""minor"" weed smoking couldn't ever hurt right? I smoked regularly for say 2,5 years give and take, during that time my grades dropped, I distanced myself from loved ones in favour of hanging out with some random stoner dudes, my economy turned to shit and lastly I felt like utter shit. One can see that by doing so much negative in my life and almost nothing positive you will feel quite bad, but weed makes u numb and lies to you by saying that everything is good, hell it's even better then good, it's grooving along with a giggling face. 
One cold winter night my parents found my friends bong at my place and then I was shit out of luck, or on my way to being redeemed as a matter of fact. To make a long story short I absolutely hated my parents for wanting me to quit and saw them as stupid because they believed all the drug ""propaganda"". I was forced to take regular drug test at some social service centre, which to I absolutely hated. I smoked sneaky by doing at just the right time so I would be clean when taking tests, in other words I was still addicted. I'm a bit resistant to people claiming to know what's best for me and if I wanna do something god dammit then i want to do it myself for myself, not because some old lady employed by state who would never even remember my face tells me to. I don't why or how but eventually i came to realise that weed was indeed fucking up life, it was hard to tell my old friends that I wouldn't smoke anymore but I needed to it. Some of them were long time friends so distancing myself from them just because some stupid plant sucked, it really sucked however I knew that my own wellbeing was more important so I bittersweetly left them to their own devices. 
I've know been clean from weed for a little bit more then half a year and that feels amazing, I still get cravings ofcourse and especially when the sun first showed itself after a long cold winter, I didn't act upon them tho so now its easier. During this time I have ""fixed"" alot of the things I fucked up while smoking weed and of course I'm feeling alot better overall. The one thing that quitting weed has brought which wants to make me praise god in streets for is friends and people that care about me! Weed friends only care about weed and themselves, not you. I've started talking to more people and hanging out with people that are healthy and happy, these are people I've been acquainted with during my weed smoking years but never really got to know. These people love me for who I am, supports me because they know how bad and difficult I've had it and god I don't know how to describe it but they just fill me with love and joy! I've always been a bit of a loner and weed well weed just skyshoted my lonerness to the moon. So actually having genuine good friends that supports brings tears to my eyes, i don't even know if ever experienced friends that support me in my endeavours. All this time I been struggling to stay afloat by my self, as I said earlier I cant really describe it in words but to me it's just beautiful, when Plato tried to describe absolute beauty I think this could in fact fit into his definition! 
It hurts to think back and realise that I could've had this amazing thing all the time, on top of that (my newfound friends goes are my classmates) we are quitting school in just one fucking month and I'm scared that we will lose contact. But I have hope that we will keep in contact. 
I think that's it folks! I appreciate and salute you if you actually read everything up until this part, if you want to ask me anything or share some similar story I would love it. Putting these feelings into words helps tremendously. I wish you all the best :)",3,1

If you're in your early days know this: things get better. For me it took about 6 months before I really started feeling significantly better on a regular basis. For me weed really played with my emotions and internal thought patterns. Lots of negative stuff was generated by weed. I'd have thoughts I didn't want to have, ones I wouldn't think when sober. I wasn't in control of my mind (at least not as much as you can be).

Life has become more meaningful. I care about things that weed allowed me to ignore or hide from. Quitting weed wasn't the be-all-end-all, it took and is taking a lot of effort on my part to make self improvements and to take action on things that are important to me. Weed made it real easy before to just ignore stuff and not care about things I really should have been caring about. 

I'm also approaching 3 years clean of booze, which I drank a lot of, especially over the last decade. Are there things I miss? Of course, ignoring the fact that there were times that I enjoyed immensley would be lying to myself (and you). I know that on a certain level I would very much enjoy an afternoon/evening of beer drinking with weed between each beverage. At least, the old me would have enjoyed that. The effect on its own now would be enjoyable but not the guilt and subsequent spiraling out of control that would follow. Therefore the thought of even doing so is no longer appealing to me and I don't entertain those thoughts anymore.

While the highs of my new life aren't the soaring and intense highs I experienced artificially through substance consumption they are wholesome, more rewarding, memorable and more repeatable now. I appreciate life and the simple things that being present has to offer.",91,0

But it's recently gone poorly in the last month.* 

I seem to be triggered when I have feelings which I can't deal with, and also when I have to be tight and focused for a long time. I am also a contact juggler, and smoking allows me to enjoy my practice in a less rigid fashion- recently I have been taking high level classes which were super difficult and hard to focus on, which meant I was tempted to smoke to relax my brain into a flow state. (which I will admit did improve my juggling a great deal, but I don't like the trade off because my ability to moderate is dismal)  


**I am really trying to make this just a blip in an otherwise sober year** but in April it kept happening that I would relapse for a few days then drag myself out.  
As someone who has been trying to completely quit for a *long* while- I notice myself do really well for the first few months of the year and then relapse within 4 months, then sometimes I can keep off it for the summer, but last year I relapsed again in October- December.  


*For me it is usually okay after two weeks of going off smoking, then I can finally relax and not think about it. I am finding my ADHD meds help a little. I am at the point where I understand I am using weed to self medicate, as my brain does not produce enough dopamine.*  
 I know theoretically that I do not want to be doing this. I can see myself slipping behind at work, letting myself give into lethargy and struggling to have the attention span to eat. Unfortunately there is a part of my brain, running parrelel to my rational mind, a tiny gremlin that now remembers what it feels like.

My father was a professional pianist (classical / jazz), and growing up, all my friends played music and/or were in a band. Weed was /is a massive part of my music scene. Literally anyone I  jammed with, was going to be high.  


When I'd say to my spouse ""I'm going down to X's house - we're gonna jam."" that was code. It was code for ""I'm going down to X's house, and we're gonna get high.""   


The basement would fill with smoke before people even plugged in. The music we produced high that we thought was so great ? Let me tell you, it wasn't .  


If I had $20 for every time I had to sit through some simple 12 bar blues progression jam with stoners that goes on for like, freaking MINUTES ON END over the decades, I would have literally enough to put a down payment on a cottage. It wasn't great music. It was very rarely ""great"" music. Because we were all high. Oh sure, sometimes the most talented guy would let loose with some amazing riffs or runs, but by and large.... it was mediocre music produced by a bunch of stoners, and the entire event felt more like a big ""I'm Ok / You're OK"" circle of weed abuse versus a creative endeavour.  


Due to the pandemic and other life circumstances, I'm now playing solo at home, and taking my lessons via Skype with a new (sober) instructor who I simply adore.  But my musical friends are also my lifelong friends. I've known them for 40+ years. At some point, I will visit them again and be exposed to their scene --- which is that music can't be played without being high at some point.

 I have months to prepare for that eventuality, but realize it will be one of \*the\* most important associations to break free of in my mind -- the weed and music, esp playing music, must ipso facto, go hand in hand. I can't tell you how ingrained that belief is in me, both from experience and from the media, etc.  


I'm playing more challenging stuff now. I guess hearing my dad's music growing up is subliminally affecting me, because I'm now doing more jazz than anything else. It's definitely helping keep me busy while quitting, and I'll be interested to see if my progress changes since I won't be getting high before every lesson. Maybe I'll find ""get"" the circle of fifths ?..... (please, no other musician send me a link or try and explain it ! Again - many have tried /many have failed !)

Just over 3 months clean. It’s been a rollercoaster but overall my trajectory has been upwards, and it’s been a little while since I felt any kind of craving or desire to smoke. Far from it - I’ve been feeling so much better in many ways. 

But in the last week or so I’ve run into a few issues. I feel a bit unreal and disconnected. Things sometimes feel hyper-real, a bit uncomfortably so on occasion. As if I’ve emerged into a world that’s recognisable but also unfamiliar. I’ve developed a ringing in my ears, and it’s really starting to wind me up. When I’m engrossed in something I forget about it, but in silence (which is something I’ve been seeking out), it’s all I can hear. I think I’m too focussed on it and am looking for it. 

Part of me thinks this is all part of recovery and adjusting to life without weed after 30+ years. But last year I quit for 4 months and didn’t experience any of this. 

Any thoughts gratefully received",1,0

this system is basically just a platform in which you can bargin with yourself (to avoid punishing youself), and i actually feel rewarded when the timer stays below 1 hr total (meaning my rate is 1 bowl/45mins). i also know that if i really wanted to i could push it to 3 hrs (3 consecutive bowls) to get that satisfying hit, i think its because as long as i allow my self the possibility but not exercise it, i can knowingly deny it thus proving to myself my newfound discipline, this option doesn't exist cold turkey.

had a couple craving today after an honest chat with a friend. i like to think that i’ve replaced weed with honesty! and it’s feeling really good. i’m amazed i’ve made it this far. a friend came over and smoked in my house and while i was tempted...i stayed strong. this is feeling really real. 

in some ways i felt like i was using weed to suppress my feelings and not deal with some serious trauma and other issues. i finally feel ready to tackle that stuff too. it’ll be hard work but i’ve got support. 

i’m also way more in my head about than i was before. spinning in circles about this guy i like that friend zoned me. overthinking all sorts of things. i used to smoke about it. now i’m

My story

This is going to be kinda all over the place but I just wanted to let everyone know my story so that others understand that they arent alone. To begin, this is actually my 3rd time ive stopped smoking weed and let me tell it doesnt get easier going through withdrawals even though I expect them to hit me the way they do. Ive been smoking for 4 years now on and off and each time its for 6-8 months of morning-night smoking LITERALLY ALL DAY than a 6+ month sober period. It gets to the point where I need to smoke to eat, which im sure is the case for all of you who wake and bake and smoke throughout the day. I've smoked so much that being high also felt like being sober. So now with the journey of sobering up. Last Thursday April 22 I stopped smoking once again and let me tell you each time ive stopped smoking the first couple days are literally HELL. Having fever like symptoms, crying literally for no reason, not being able to eat, headaches, not able to sleep because of the fever like symptoms. I am now on day 5 and this is where things start to get better for me at least some people may need more or less time depending on your consumption. I haven't really been able to enjoy my meals and let alone EAT 3 whole meals today for the first time in days! Weed is crazy because it makes you feel content with you life when in reality you really arent. You're trying to fill a void that you have no idea you're in. I just now realized this the 3rd time sobering up, but dont let me steer you away from smoking weed but also dont make it a daily habit more so dont buy CARTS (in my eyes its the hardcore version of weed) because it makes it so much easier to make it a habit and is such a damn good high. I definitely dont want to stop smoking forever but I think its time to start moderating alot more strictly, once in a while is cool and THAT HIGH once in a while is SOOOO MUCH BETTER than daily use where you have to quadruple your consumption to feel the high that you want. Im here if anyone needs any tips on getting through this you arent alone.",2,0

I’ve gotten and job and held it down for 6 months now, fully furnished our apartment and got it looking like a real home and not my usual trap house and biggest of all, haven’t considered relapsing because I refuse to put myself around that lifestyle for me, my wife and our daughter.

Man smoking weed has gotten so old. For years, I've done hardly anything but waste my life away. Lost opportunity. Lost time. Broken relationships. Making an absolute fool out of myself.

By 24, I figured I'd be much further than I am at now. It seems like such a heavy weight to even begin unpacking. Knowing I'm not alone in this makes it hurt a lot less. Quitting weed is just one of the bad habits that must go.

In general for me, it's literally any instant gratification. It seems to suck everything out of me. My brain is just like PRESS THE BUTTON PRESS THE BUTTON PRESS THE BUTTON. Meanwhile, life keeps going by.

Far to often, I find myself comparing my life to others. Sure maybe it can be useful to look at where other people are, and where you aren't IF you want to be where they are. But in today's social media glitz and glamor society, everything seems so face deep. So false. When behind it, so many people are suffering. Trying to persuade people who don't care about them that their life is perfect.

Is this what life is? Working 40+ hours a week at a job you hate, to live for the weekend only to spend that time watching tv, getting drunk, high, or all of these other meaningless things it's too easy to fall into? One thing for sure, when I'm on my deathbed I'm certainly not going to say ""Oh boy, I'm glad I spent so much time playing that video game, watching tv, or getting high"" Sure there were some fun times for me, but that time is long gone.

I want nothing to do with that. I want my life to mean something and it can. I can't allow myself to be nobody. I'm tired of complaining and coming up with all sorts of reasons of why I can't. Yeah, there's problems and everybody has them. But will I just sit here and point fingers? Or stand up and do something about it.

I'm picking up the pieces of my life, I threw my stuff in the trash the other day. Day 2 without this vice numbing me out of my mind. Things aren't like out of this world awesome, but I feel ALOT better. If there's any one thing I took away from my days in AA, One day at a time. Sometimes one moment.

From what I’ve read we all have somewhat similar journeys and like many of you here Ive been smoking for the longest time.. I remember smoking my first zoot when I was in year 9 and at that time I’d always say “ill never be the type of person who smokes everyday”.. fast forward to uni and I was smoking everyday lol. 

I think all in all I’ve been smoking for about 10 years now and been saying I’m going to quit for about 3 lol

Something I’ve come to understand is quitting is a journey. 

There’s going to be ups and downs and periods where you break and find any excuse to smoke whether it’s a party, rewarding yourself or just chilling with friends. But it’s about whether or not you can pick yourself back up and keep going because every time u choose to quit your resolve will get stronger and stronger. You just gotta remind yourself why you’re doing it. 

For me, over time getting high went from crazy, hilarious out of this world conversations with friends to barely even being bothered to make convo. Its honestly just sucked the life out of me and makes me not want to do anything at all when there’s a whole world out there and we aren’t getting any younger. 

Nowadays I have a few friends who have quit and I promise you just by looking in their eyes you can see they’re so full of life, energy and motivation doing things they’d never have even imagined before. Vice versa I have a few friends who have no desire to ever stop and I promise you just by looking into their eyes you can see an empty soul with next to no energy for anything else other than feeding their addiction. 

Unfortunately when you quit you’ll have your smoker friends trying to bring you back at any opportunity and eventually you’ll come to realise that you’re better off without those people in your life. But THATS FINEEEE because you don’t need that negativity anyway and now you can replace that time wasted by exploring your hobbies where ull meet cool people anyway. 

Anyways let me not ramble on too much. I’ve tried to quit many times and failed each and every time but this time, I gave a close friend my word that I’m done with it, I gave him a semi dramatic speech about how there’s more to life and threw away all my weed. Making that promise to my friend has somehow given me strength I never knew I had. 

This time it feels different, that over bearing urge to smoke gets weaker and weaker as my resolve has gotten stronger and stronger. So to everyone whose trying and failing ... keep going because I PROMISE you it’ll get easier and life gets better.",3,0

This big for me. This is really big and I don't want to think about it too much or I'll get overwhelmed. Just like with any of this stuff, if I think about 'not' smoking weed then I start 'to' think about smoking weed.

Today I am 3months and 29 days clean and sober. 

Do I feel better? Yes! Do I feel great? NO! Life sucks sometimes lol. 

but I feel like myself , I feel like I can access myself with clarity.

Standing advice for anyone new:

- The only way out is thru. It will get harder before it gets easier, but it will get easier.

- Just focus on winning today, every day. Don't look far ahead.

- Do not put an end date on this, just today.

- The reward is YOU. You get YOURSELF back. Your thoughts will not be consumed by weed. Think of where you can invest them. 

- Hagan Daz strawberry ice cream is the best one. I like that to help temper cravings because it's not TOO sweet, but pacifies me.",18,0

The thing is I’m not high functioning, people may see that on the outside but internally I feel like a wreck. Objectively I have a great life and things are better than they’ve ever been but I’m at one of the lowest points I’ve been at in my life mentally / emotionally. I started smoking 3.5 years ago, daily use starting 2.5 years ago and feel like anyone who has met me in the last couple years hasn’t met the real me, just the quiet, anxious shell of myself I have become. People seem to like me but I feel like it’s not me they like, just the projection of myself I put out with how I feel like “I” would act. I just go through the motions. If I’m being honest I really don’t want to quit, it’s the only thing that really helped me with my depression. Until it didn’t and it gave me anxiety. I’ve gone through a lot of changes in the last few years and I don’t even really know who I am anymore. Despite the fact that I waste so much time ruminating, in my own head feeling distracted and disconnected from the world around me. I’m not happy unless I smoke and that’s not real happiness, and it’s not even really been the high I feel, when I smoke lately it just makes me feel normal. I don’t want to have to smoke to feel normal. I made an appointment with a therapist who I will hopefully be seeing in a couple weeks after the severe withdrawal period is over, I need to quit to get the most out of my sessions. I don’t want to do ANYTHING. I do want to want to do things. I’ve tried quitting before and it helped the anxiety but each time I gave in with the idea I would be able to use moderately... which led to daily use again. My partner smokes and is supportive when I try to quit but they have no issues with weed themselves so conversations during my withdrawal period surrounding my feelings usually end up in an argument. I’ve tried to do it on my own every time and failed, I’ve lurked here for a long time but I’m making a post today in hopes that some community and accountability helps. 

So, even though I don’t want to quit I know I need to. I can’t keep going on this way. My depression and anxiety is worsening and I need to quit to be able to get treatment. 

I haven’t smoked since Sunday night, tonight I’m going to smoke with my partner since she planned a special night for my bday. I know I won’t be nice to be around if I don’t smoke no matter how hard I try, because of how down I feel from the withdrawals and my depression right now. So, tonight I’m going to have one last joint and tomorrow sobriety begins. I’m hopeful that in getting therapy this time around I’ll be able to stick to it but trying not to set myself up for disappointment in case the therapist isn’t a good match for me ; I had a bad experience with one a couple years ago and never went back.

Oddly I feel the same way I did when I would wake up from a weed nap. Tired, unmotivated, in a haze

Except instead of weed induced anxiety, I now feel blank, like no emotions except wanting to sleep more and more. I barely have energy to do the most basic tasks. 

But I keep going. 

I’m also delighted to have bought a book on self improvement and am joining an intense program soon for my pre-existing anxiety 

But I feel like I just don’t care about myself. Sometimes I think about just tossing myself off a bldg because I don’t want to feel so blank and unmotivated and now no longer high and unable to distract from painful reality of living with my ex and having no family

The worst part is I feel like I don’t love my pets with the same intensity as when I was high. 
I am always annoyed or just indifferent.
One snuggles in my arms, but instead of being so loving towards him, I just scroll on my phone and hardly pet him or look at him. And when I force myself to do it, it’s like I just hardly feel the same. Idk wtf is wrong with me. He used to be my whole world. I feel so guilty

I do have bipolar and bpd, but I’m on medication and it definitely has made me stable-until I got off weed. I’m not depressed, but definitely anxious again. I have PTSD and Generalized anxiety disorder. 

Never until recently did I had a nervous breakdown recently because having so many responsibilities and stressors and no weed or support system. 

but if I sit still and do absolutely nothing important, and just let the blankness wash over me and make me into a robot,  it helps my anxiety. Unfortunately that also means everything goes to shit.  

So today I’m going to take care of some minor responsibilities and do some self care. But even the thought of it has me anxious. Life is like on fast-forward now that I’m sober. It’s all going too fast, even if not much is even going on.

So quick backstory, I'm a twenty-three-year-old woman who hasn't had a drink in NINE MONTHS! I am stoked and so proud of myself. At the age of seventeen, I tumbled headfirst into the ever-shrinking world of abusing alcohol. About a year before alcohol became a way to self-medicate, I'd started smoking pot regularly. By regularly I mean every night before bed. Anywho, by the time I was nineteen, I was drinking myself into oblivion every night whilst thoroughly convincing myself that I didn't have a drinking problem. I think I rationalized it by telling myself I was just ""going through a hard time"". During this hard time, I would drink two bottles of wine every night, smoke tons of cigarettes and pot. I spent thousands of dollars, some of that money was stolen to keep my addiction afloat. At the time I never thought of it as an actual problem.

Eventually, I moved away from the situation I was in and to a new town. The change was really good for me. I was way less isolated, I got into community theatre, I started making friends who had nothing to do with booze or drugs. I was drinking less, looking better and I thought I was cured. Although there was always this nagging thought in the back of my mind that one day I would have to quit drinking.

Then about nine months ago (and three years after I'd moved) I stopped drinking. I had what I believe they call a moment of clarity. Thank God. I woke up after drinking a six-pack of beers on my own to realize that I was very fucking late to a job I loved very fucking much. Strangely enough, this was not my worst waking up from a night of drinking. I'd had mornings way worse. Nights had still chilled me to the bone to think about. How did I come out of that alive? How did I not kill anyone driving drunk? These are questions I still think about.

Life has gotten a lot better since I quit. The world feels like a much more gentle, inspiring place. A place I want to explore, a place I want to be in. Rather than disappearing to find what lies at the bottom of the bottle. However, something that has been tripping me up lately is my pot use. When. I quit alcohol, I told myself that I could still smoke pot. At the time I was smoking a lot less than normal. I think it helped ease me into those early days and weeks and months when you feel all raw and vulnerable like a hermit crab without its shell.

This Winter however I hit a depressive low and started smoking a LOT. More than I have in years. All-day every day. I was disassociating a lot of the time spent on my own and I spent more and more time on my own and less and less connecting with other people. This last month or so I've been crawling out of that hole. I'm still smoking daily but far less and with some resemblance of boundaries. It's ""doable"" now.

Here's the thing that keeps coming up and it kills me to write this but I think I need to stop smoking pot. One of the most difficult things I find with being an addict is being able to recognize that a substance is hurting you and you continue to feel enslaved to it. That's how I feel with pot and how I felt with booze and cigs before I quit them. It's an absolute mind fuck. And I find it so difficult to remember to give myself compassion in those moments. I fucking love pot like it is my long-term partner that I need to ditch. Because it kind of is. It's been with me since I was sixteen. I don't know who I am without it. I know that I felt something like this about alcohol at some point too. I just can't remember how I changed the narrative around it.

Does anyone have any advice to quitting cannabis or getting sober from a drug after quitting alcohol? Does anyone have any advice in general? Anything you got, hit me with it.

Part of me just wants to get high to numb it all out. At the end of the day I’ve realized I’ve cried a quarter of it. I’m currently training for a marathon and it’s been my one source of happiness.

I’m wondering if my depression is worse cause I’m actually not high for the first time in my adult life or if I’m grieving my best friend, Mary Jane. Maybe a mix of both.

Yesterday night also I was with a couple friends and they did smoke but I didnt aswell. 

That would be inimaginable just 14 days ago. And now I was able to effectively do It.

Im so happy and proud of myself. And that community here definitely helped me and played a huge role on my decision.

&#x200B;

I am a 34-year-old male. I have been happily married for over 5 years. I am successful in my line of work, software engineering. I've used cannabis all day every day for roughly 4 years. Today I quit for good.

&#x200B;

In my post I'm going to detail my plan to attack the problem with why's, how's, and what's. 

&#x200B;

Whys

Marijuana has always been the enjoyable mind-alerting substance of choice for 12+ years now. It wasn't until the pandemic occurred that I realized I have a major dependency on this drug. 

I have tried to quit multiple times. Whether it was throwing my stash away in the trash, only to dig it out a few hours later when I feel a craving. 

I believe cannabis is holding me back from achieving the next level of my life. 

I've achieved many great things these past few years, a successful career, a happy marriage. But at the same time, I've lost myself. My mental and physical health has deteriorated over the years at the cost of prioritizing other things. 

Cannabis numbs my mental senses, allows me to sit on the couch for hours on end, and do absolutely nothing. It makes me take multiple trips to the kitchen for snacks. What used to be a tool for creativity and focus is now a tool to make me lazier, dumber, less productive, and if I want to become the man I hope to be, I need to step away from this drug.

 

Hows

So how am I going to quit this time? I believe it all starts with the mind. How I perceive the world around me. The mind distorts my perception of what is real, my emotions, and how I react to them. 

A healthy, happy mind will allow me to make rational decisions that benefit my mental and physical state.

A healthy diet, daily exercise, and a strict morning routine will provide a solid foundation that I can build off of. 

Whats

So what will I do today to help solve this problem? 

Today I will focus on making the right choice. 

Instead of waking and baking and watching youtube, I will exercise. 

Instead of ordering DoorDash breakfast burritos, I will make a fruit smoothie. 

Instead of allowing cannabis to control my life, I will forge my own path to greatness. 

Today I have decided to take that first step.",9,1

Also, yesterday I managed to set up a date with a cute girl I know, something I would’ve never done high. 

AND on top of that, some chick approached me and gave me her number without me asking! Don’t know if that’s because my eyes looked a bit more “alive” instead of me always looking annoyed, burnt out, and unapproachable. Im assuming that’s why because it’s never happened before.

Papers, a pipe, definitely my large metal grinder (hey ! those things are expensive !). I'd rationalize holding on to remnants of my weed habit by thinking ""Hey it's legal now in my country. So as an adult and a thoughtful hostess, I should have some gear on hand in case someone drops by and wants to burn. It's like making sure your liquor cabinet has a selection of wine, beer, and spirits. It's a sign of being cosmopolitan. Just like you're not going to, like, *drink* all that booze, you won't use any of that paraphernalia. You just have it on hand. In case. For visitors !.....""
And naturally, in the back of my mind I was thinking I'd keep that stuff because I'd go back to smoking. But y'know... moderately. So keep it on hand. Just in case.

Seriously - who was I kidding ? I can't do ""moderately"" with weed. In for a penny, in for a pound.

But this time ? Chucked it all. All of it. Gave about $200 of weed away to friends who indulge and let them know I'm quitting (they are super supportive). I languished in getting rid of a Ryot kit that held about 2 grams, a tiny pipe, and papers - ""I need an emergency stash maybe... just to.. know it's there."" I hid it in the house after I'd binned everything else, still rationalizing holding on to this tiny little remnant. Then woke up at 2 am and went ""For real woman....just put in the trash and don't look back. It's like, $50 worth of crap, and will be a constant temptation.""
For the first time in..... ever ? since like 1996 .... there is absolutely diddly squat gear in my house related to smoking weed. I didn't even hold on to a lighter.

I know I'm just starting out (again) and triggers will come at me. But I really don't need to leave triggers lying around my own home, niggling the back of my brain to dig into that tiny ""emergency"" stash in order to cope with Adulting. I've left myself no ""easy out"" this time with regards to my own environment.
And on top of everything else........ hello ? Global Pandemic you silly woman ! My province has been in lockdown 300 out of 365 days - no other jurisdiction in all of North America has been locked down more than Ontario. Who the hell is ""coming over"" that might want to smoke weed anyway ?!?!

I used to sneak out with some friends into the woods and blaze it up, just a social activity which I enjoyed so much. Then, when I came back home, I learned that my father was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer with metastasis in his liver. Though he was given around 6 months to live, he soldiered on for 5 more years. Weed during this time became an escape from reality for me, no longer a social activity to occasionally enjoy with friends. It was helpful at first, but I got addicted to evading reality and my emotions, and when my father died, I just didn't want to deal with anything anymore. Over the next 4 years I became an emotionally stunted, depressed guy whose self esteem and confidence got destroyed by my unwillingness to face my situation, depression, and the world itself. I used to be brilliant in mathematics and won many prizes as a teenager, now, I've delayed my university career two years (actually four since I moved away from my home country and started another career from scratch) because I simply stopped going to class, not even wanting to get up from my bed except to get high and play videogames, starting in the morning and going on through the entire day and night. 

I'm tired of it all, tired of cowering from life and all it has to offer, tired of not being able to have a good mood if I don't smoke, tired of being scared of generating a lasting happiness, and tired of being terrified at not having something external to point at and blame for my unhappiness. I know cannabis isn't the culprit here, buy my relationship with it has just become toxic. I still fantasize of being able to have a steady and healthy relationship with it, but after so many years of trying I think it's time to listen to the evidence. I want to remember what life is like without it, what generating dopamine through effort feels like, what being truly independent and being responsible for myself tastes like. I just want to give my sober self another chance to exist and enjoy life. Weed was a big part of my life for a long time and it brought me many awesome friends and memories, and it helped me deal with a terrible depression, but it has since taken complete control of my life and smothered my actual true sober self to the point I don't remember who that really is.

I've been off it for a week now, and while insanely jumpy and irritable, everyday I feel more motivated to succeed in life, paired with being constant at exercising for a month now, I'm slowly but surely building my self-confidence back.

I hate to say it but i really havent noticed too much of a difference. Im still foggy often, have very little motivation and havent found much joy life. Overall i have noticed im more comfortable with life and get a lot less anxiety, especially socially. Used to have mini anxiety attacks while high and now when i have them its not nearly as bad.

I also went through a breakup about 5days after smoking weed so im sure thats contributed to my lack of “progress” mentally. Idk im tired of feeling low but i know smoking weed wont really change things.. maybe it will but just not having those anxiety attacks and being able to pick up phone calls and respond to text messages is enough on its own to keep going.

I started weaning off dabs a few days ago but its like rage fits and and super high anxiety just going to like 1-3 dabs a day mostly at night from like 15-20 dabs a day, my flower usage has gone up to try and compensate and I am slowing down on the carts too but like fully quitting is almost terrifying.

I have not stopped smoking for more than 6 months, and that was  when I got put into rehab at 17, and because I was forced to not by choice. I have been diagnosed with all sorts of fun things over the years ADHD, hyper mania, bi polar, CPTSD, anxiety, and depression. I've tried so many meds to try and help and feel like weed was the only thing and it's ""all natural"" so in my brain more healthy than pharmaceuticals.

But the truth shall set you free, so they say. But it’s the honest truth that my dependence on weed to “cope” and deal with life’s issues led to that. My dad and I were doing the bedside vigil at the hospital and around 4am I excused myself and made a frantic call to get weed. I met some random guy in a gas station parking lot and couldn’t smoke up fast enough. Mom passed away 4 hours later. I was at her bedside- utterly baked. My dad of course, had no idea. 

I had one mom. I had one chance only to get it right- to see her off in a manner I could look back on and recall with love and honour. And I can’t. I never will. Because my stupid fucking weed habit trumped doing the right thing. Instead of love and honour, I will recall my mother’s death with shame and regret. 

That was 3 years ago. I knew then that was a “rock bottom” incident. I’ve quit twice since then for about 3 or 4 months. But got sucked back in for all the reasons I’m sure I don’t have to detail to you. 

Forgiving myself for this is .... impossible. At least it feels that way right now. But my mom developed late onset alcoholism and conquered it with AA’s help. 

I have been trying hard to quit but need a forum for support. I’m pretty sure mom would understand.

I try and set a date like my birthday, or something even more arbitrary to be the day I finally have my last hit of weed. Don't get me wrong, if it works for you it works, but don't expect something external like a certain date or moment to push you towards the final goal of quitting. 

There is no idyllic last high. In fact, if your last time smoking turns out to be an enjoyable time, then how much more likely does that make it that you will return in a few weeks, or even a few days? Sometimes having a particularly rough time being high has been much more motivating for me when quitting. 

A good friend of mine once put it this way: ""You'll keep doing it and doing it until you absolutely cannot.""

Don't take that as meaning that you should just binge on weed until you're sick of it, but just stay tuned in to what your mind and body are telling you and you will find that right time to quit naturally. Don't force it if it doesn't feel right, and I know a lot of people will disagree with that sentiment, but what I really mean to say is that you'll know when you know.

Cannabis-induced bipolar disorder might be what I'm dealing with, and the only way I can be rightfully diagnosed with something is if I stop smoking. I went to a psychiatrist and she would not diagnose me with bipolar because I smoke. The problem is that I just bought two more carts that will last me at least 2 weeks.

Need advice/support,"I’m 18 and I started smoking at 15 because of peer pressure and wanting to be cool. It radically changed the path I took in high school. Even though I have pretty bad ADHD, I was a gifted actor, and a smart and artistic kid. Over the course of high school I disappointed my parents/instructors constantly with my antics. I didn’t even like weed that much at first, I only wanted to be a delinquent. 

I eventually I stopped coming to class at all and freaked my parents out with some depressive episodes in grade 11-12. This was largely due to me feeling like my life was pointless. I basically lived to see my friends, get high, vape and play video games. School felt impossible, the stress of which lead me to bed-ridden depression. 

Then came the pandemic. Now I could have all the free time I wanted, take a year off and find myself. But all I did was get a part time job and smoke a bowl twice a day, playing video games and watching youtube. This was my first time being an actual stoner, buying my own weed. I was numb constantly, but I felt like myself again for the first time in a couple years. I was pretty happy, looking back.

Fast forward to about 4 months ago. I was sitting in bed, high, and thought “what am i doing? I’m wasting my youth like this. I need to participate in life, get a grip and use my skills and talents.” This was a big revelation at the time.

So I quit smoking, (and vaping, but only for a month or so) started exercising (again, only for a little bit) and signed up for finishing my high school credits. I even tried to quit porn for a bit, lol. My parents were thrilled about this “new me” and I’m closer to them now than I have been since elementary school. I felt great, and obnoxiously proud of myself. It’s funny in retrospect, considering my mental state now.

These last few months have been.... pretty bad. My social skills have declined dramatically. Even the smallest interaction at work drives me crazy with anxiety. I have lost my connection to my friends because I feel like weed was the only thing that made me want to hang out with them. At first I thought they were losers, but now I see them enjoying each-other’s company and their simple pleasures and I am jealous. I used to be funny, energetic, and brought people together. Now I am not interested in anything that anyone says, and I have nothing to say.

I feel like I am a completely different person, but more anxious and lazy. The motivation to do schoolwork, participate in hobbies, generally better myself, is simply not there anymore. All I do is browse social media and youtube, hit my vape and jerk off. I can’t even focus on making songs anymore when I used to love doing that. Video games are boring. Even listening to music or watching a movie bores me. 

I feel like a fucking robot, man. I am addicted to technology, vaping, and porn like never before.

I am not the smart person I thought I was without weed, either. I absolutely hate doing schoolwork, I don’t understand nearly as much of the material as I thought I would. My ADHD meds have stopped working like they did before. I am a chronic procrastinator and I am managing my time horribly, but I simply don’t care anymore.

This is really bad. I think this may be depression, though milder than it was before. It sucks to admit, but I want to go back to weed. I want to bond with my friends again. I want to enjoy music, and be free of this constant anxiety and guilt and thinking. And all I think about is myself, so this post is the kinda shit I do to pass time now. Write my self-centred thoughts and fears into a self-help subreddit. Whoopee.

My weed addiction used to run my life. Literally. I saw every situation and thought, ""how am I going to fit smoking into this?"" Which included things like smoking in rest-stop bathrooms. Bathrooms at the movie theater. You name it, I smoked/vaped there. 

It's sad to me that most of my friends and all of my family still smoke and they're all likely addicted to some degree. My (ex) best friend once told my partner (before I quit) ""There's absolutely no way she's ever going to quit, she's the weed queen."" And I'll never forget when I went to my dad's place to give him my vape pen batteries and bong, he told me, ""I'll be holding onto these for you.""

I'm currently looking for an accountability partner with whom I can have daily/bi-weekly/weekly short chats. Preferably via WhatsApp, but other mediums are also fine.

Weed is basically treated the same as super hard drugs there - especially if you're trying to bring it into the country as a foreigner. I actually knew this ahead of time and decided not to bring any weed on this trip for this exact reason. I landed there, went through customs, got sniffed by the customs dog while waiting in line, answered their questions, and they let me through, past the guys holding automatic rifles.

Once I arrived at my hotel and unpacked my bags, I found my aluminum grinder at the bottom of my backpack that I had just went through customs with, packed full of bud. It was left there from a camping trip the previous weekend, and I had missed it when I was packing for this trip. I guess the customs dog was having an off-day? Talk about me catching a lucky break. If I had been caught, I would have been locked up for who knows how long, banned from the country for life when I eventually did get out of prison, and definitely been fired from my job. Destroying my career would have been the smallest of my problems.

So after I found the grinder, freaked out, calmed down, and my heart finally stopped pounding out of my chest, wanna guess what I did? If you guessed that I went down to the buffet, grabbed an apple, MacGyvered myself a bowl, and smoked it out of my hotel window like a fuckin' crackhead, you'd be correct.

I'm 34 and have been a daily smoker since I was about 17, with maybe a year or 2 total of sobriety sprinkled in there when I was looking for a job or trying to get my shit together in general.

Before the pandemic, I was able to (more like I HAD to) keep my smoking to after-work hours, because getting stoned at the office in my field simply isn't possible.

The moment I got home from work, I'd hit the bowl and would basically keep hitting it until bedtime. And once weed vape pens became a thing a few years ago, I'd be hitting that nonstop when I was out and about as well. Out to dinner with friends, at the movies, walking along the river with my girlfriend, on an airplane, whatever. I'd hide the weed pen in my palm and sleeve, make sure no one was looking, then take a hit, and then hold it long enough to ghost it so there was no vape cloud when I exhaled. I thought I was being super stealthy, but in retrospect I'm sure it was obvious to the people closest to me.

Since the lockdown began last year, I've been working from home, and slowly turned into a wake-and-bake, all-day-every-day stoner. I'm an early riser, and every morning looked forward to brewing myself a cup of coffee, strolling out to the patio, and smoking a joint watching the sun come up, and then going back inside to read the news and reddit for a couple of hours before I had to be online for work. It felt great in the moment, but then led to me being groggy, slow, and cranky for the rest of the day. Even now at this moment, I'm still romanticizing the idea of doing that in my head and have the urge to do so, regardless of the obvious consequences.

It definitely affected my work performance, and eventually led to me being laid off in February. This actually wasn't the worst thing, because I hated that job even when I was sober. I definitely would have ended up leaving that job one way or another, but I could have done so much better at handling the whole thing, and could have found another better job before I basically just stopped doing my work because I'd rather be off in my own stoney little world.

It's affected my relationship with my fiance as well. I'll say dumb shit when I'm stoned, and not even realize that I'm being insensitive in the moment. I'll forget plans that we had, which obviously makes her upset if it was a special occasion that we planned. She will ask me to help out with things around the house, and I'll put them off forever and then forget because I'm feeling tired and grouchy from being stoned out of my gourd all day. I don't plan dates on the weekend anymore because I'd rather be getting high and sitting around. It's also incredibly hard to be romantic when you've been stoned since 7am and your eyes are bloodshot and red, so our sex life has suffered as well.

I've had diagnosed ADHD since I was a kid, and had always convinced myself that weed had some sort of positive medical effect on my condition. But that couldn't be further from the truth. It seems silly to even think that now. I'm already super vulnerable to distractions and can lack the motivation/ability to get started on things. Of course weed isn't going to help with that - it has the exact opposite effect. I just loved weed so much precisely because it allowed me to block out the real world and focus only on my favorite distractions such as video games, junk food, cartoons, daydreaming, etc. I was only interested in making myself happy RIGHT NOW, and weed was able to do that for me, regardless of the consequences later on.

And honestly by this point, I don't even really enjoy being high anymore. It makes me antisocial, paranoid, unmotivated, and just kinda slow and dumb. Maybe 1 out of 10 times I will actually enjoy it nowadays. I will think I really want it and will look forward to it, but then I'll smoke and it's very ""meh"". It's just something that I have to do, because if I don't smoke then I start getting hit by withdrawal symptoms, and it's all I can think about until I smoke again.

Cut to now, and I'm having a really hard time with day to day life. I need to find a new job, which takes a lot of work, motivation, and focus. Meanwhile I'm just trying to manage my addiction, and timing my weed usage around job interviews and such, to hit some sort of ""sweet spot"" where I'll be mostly sober, but not sober enough to be experiencing withdrawal symptoms. It's a game that can't be won and it feels terrible. I also really want to start doing some online classes to expand my skill set, but again, there's just no way I could do that right now with how many hours a day I'm spending stoned.

So. Today is sober day number 1. I've been tapering as much as I can over the past week or so. Still smoking pretty often, but reducing the amounts to just chill me out as opposed to aiming to get super high. I went to a good friend's wedding this past weekend, and didn't want to be grouchy with withdrawals for it. Now that's done, and I'm cleaning out all of my weed supplies today to keep me on track and give me something else to do.

I'm very excited to be started down this path, but also nervous. I know I feel OK right now because I smoked last night, but that won't last long. It will be a difficult first few days, but then will get a bit easier for the long haul as I try to reprogram my brain. I'm worried that I will be irritable and get in arguments with my fiance. I have told her about my struggles and let her know ahead of time so hopefully that will make things easier on both of us.

I'm also worried about the general brain fog and insomnia that I know I will have for at least a few weeks. I need my brain to be working at full capacity so I can get back on the horse with my career, and be a good partner to my fiance. As well as to take care of a few other tasks that have fallen far behind such as doing my taxes and following up with my weekly unemployment claims. I'm not sure that I will be able to follow through with everything I need to do, but I will try. Ultimately a big part of me quitting is an attempt to be better at all this stuff in the long term anyways, so a short term setback isn't a good reason not to do it.

And of course, I'm worried that if I feel really bad, or have a moment of stress or weakness, I will convince myself that it's OK smoke again. I'm in a legal state and the goddamn weed shop is only a 5 minute walk away. But if I do, I will try not to be too hard on myself, try to figure out why I smoked again, and try to make adjustments to prevent it from happening again. I know for 100% sure that it's not right for me or my life right now, and is overall having a large net-negative effect on me and those around me.

Thanks for reading this far in my wall of text, but no judgment if you skipped to the end, either :) If you feel so inclined, please share your own experiences, comments, suggestions, or whatever. I wouldn't even be attempting to quit right now if it weren't for me lurking on r/leaves and relating to so many of the experiences that other people are going through with this particularly sneaky form of addiction.",56,2

High all day every day going through a 1 gram cartridge in just two or three days or 2 grams of flower in a day. All decently high grade stuff for the most part. I’ve quit a few times, lasting about a month each time, but this time I’m quitting for real, I can’t take these withdrawals anymore. 

I’m currently on day 25. Days 18-23 were easy, I felt good, could eat as much as I wanted, didn’t lay in bed all day like at the start, and so on. Yesterday however, I felt sort of depressed, the first time in my whole life feeling that way, but it wasn’t too bad, as I just distracted myself with music, video games, and some YouTube videos. Today however, my anxiety is back, not nearly as bad as the first two weeks of quitting, as I would have panic attacks constantly. I haven’t exactly had a panic attack, but just a level of anxiety that is extremely uncomfortable that keeps me from eating, causes me to sweat, and keeps me in bed. I’m wondering if this is a sign that PAWS is beginning already, as I’ve read it usually starts after a month, and I should prepare for the long ride PAWS is. 

I’ve become pretty good at distracting myself from the withdrawals since I’ve had to do it a bunch of times, but now I’m way behind in school, and am at risk of failing out of this semester. I thought maybe I would feel better, enough to finish my classes anyways, at around this time, but clearly I was wrong. I can’t even come close to focusing on school like this. 

To all of you out there that have gone through or are going through PAWS, when did it start getting better for you? And when was it the worst? I’ve never made it more than a month or two, so what’s ahead of me is unknown to me, and sometimes scary to think about.",1,0

Very functional as well, at least I've convinced myself that I'm the most productive when I'm high. Though thinking about it now, I haven't given my sober self much time to shine. Anyways. I'm high literally all day, from the moment I get up until the time I go to sleep. That's been my life for 9 years now. I started smoking shatter 5 years ago, and my vape pen hasn't left my hand since. 


Well, yesterday I ran out, and living in a new city, I have no hookups. For the first time in yeaaars I ran out of weed without a backup. I had a full blown panic attack. I spent the entire night crying about it, scouring local social media pages searching for any mentions of weed, 420, anything really, just thinking ""there's got to be some stoners around me"", honestly all with the intentions of messaging a stranger for weed. Yikes. Luckily, I didn't. When I woke up, I cried again because I was just so nauseated, and with it being finals week, I literally thought to myself ""how am I going to get through this without weed?"".


Honestly though, I'm tired. I'm tired of not just acting like an addict but BEING an addict. I've been in denial about that for so long, like I know so many people here have been. I'm tired of hiding how much I smoke from people in my life, or lying about how much money I spend on it. I don't want my mood to be dependent on whether I'm high or not. I don't want to spend today and the next day and the next day obsessing about where I can get weed, or how I can get high. I just want to be able to live my life. I don't want weed to run my life anymore. I truly never thought I'd say it, but I'm ready to stop smoking and get my life back. 


Everyone here sharing their stories really helps me feel like overcoming this is possible, and reminds me that I'm not alone. So many of your stories and experiences resonate with me. I know what you're going through. I hope that together we can all overcome whatever we wish to.

I'm currently on Day 3 and I'm a little irritable and have trouble sleeping at night (withdrawal symptoms that seem to be the norm). I've been watching plenty of videos about others' journey quitting, and have also done a fair bit of reading on this subreddit as well. My only dilemma is that my experience with weed regarding my day to day life has been completely different from most. For example, the reason for many for quitting is the anxiety caused by weed and the detrimental effects on lifestyle. Only problem is my experience had been the complete opposite (hear me out when I say I’m being completely honest with myself). Weed actually increased my productivity greatly, and was often very invigorating for me. As a heavy smoker I would run 1.5 miles a day, followed by daily meditation, and daily reading as well (all done effectively while high). That isn’t to say that there have been no cons present, I would say from a week to week basis my memory is pretty shitty and it definitely makes me feel bad not being able to remember important things about those close to me. I say all this to say that quitting has been difficult because as of right now the pros definitely outweigh the cons. When I’m sober my anxiety is out of control, my intrusive thoughts are never ending, and generally I just don’t feel good. Entering my 19th year of life I’m aware that I’m still young and there’s time but at some point I know sobriety will be necessary (whether it be for a job or other reasons), I understand the inevitability of it but I’m really struggling to see the benefit besides saving money.",6,0

I could barely communicate with my friends while playing games without hyper-analyzing every word I say.

I printed and pasted it on the inside of my wardrobe, so that I can at least run my eyes over it every time I get ready for work or to go somewhere. I decided to share here because the posts on this subreddit also help me and serve as a reminder, so maybe my post will help someone too, especially someone who has the same reasons as me. 

1- I have ambitious long-term goals (example: i want to study programming to change carreer and become a front-end developer by 2022)  Weed makes me really lazy and unmotivated, which put me farther from achieving these goals. 

2- Weed harms my health. Smoking is bad, regardless of whether it's a cigarette or weed. I'm still putting smoke inside my lungs, which contributes to several diseases, even lung or mouth cancer. obviously smoking cigarretes is much worse, but weed is also bad. 

3- When I smoke, I lose control and eat a lot of unhealthy food like fast food, candies, etc.

4- It affects my memory. After more than five years of smoking frequently, even though I am not a daily smoker, I still feel that my ability to remember things is impaired.

5- I've been in bad and dangerous situations because of weed. 

6- weed laziness even made me stop going to the gym, something I liked to do in the past.

7- getting high is no longer so ppleasurable. Still feels good, but not at all like it was before, and only for a few hours. 

8- sometimes weed makes me paranoid and scared. I do not know why. It started after a while. 

9- I miss having fun and enjoying life without being high. I ended up creating a habit where everything I do I miss being high. If I travel, I want to be high. If I walk with my girlfriend, I want to be high. If I'm having a beer I want to be high. This is a problem. I want to enjoy life without weed. 

10- I spend a lot of money on weed. money that could be applied in more productive and rewarding ways to my life. 

11- I feel that the good time as a teenager, where getting high with friends is the only thing that matters, has passed. Now I need to be a 100% responsible adult and have control of my life. 

12- it is very difficult and probably impossible to never smoke a joint again. but I want to able to, one day, smoke a joint, enjoy the high, spend several months without smoking again and be 100% conscious and feel that I have control over myself and my habits. I never want to ever feel that my life revolves around weed again.",92,0

A friend of mine recommended Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and I scoffed at the idea initially. Weed had made me so goddamn anxious that the idea of trying anything new was always a no-go. Self-doubt, anxiety, fear that it’d be a waste of time....these irrational feelings dominated my life for years. But after a few weeks sober, I gave it a shot, and now I go every day. It’s wild to think that there was a time in my life when I preferred staying inside 24/7 and getting high as opposed to actually, well, living. 

Has exercise / sports / martial arts helped any of you?",11,0

If I can, you can.","So I've previously described myself as a serial quitter.  I rarely even made it through a full day 1.  Smoked about 20 years, heavily and daily for around 17 of those.  I have periodically spent months stuck in a cycle of waking and deciding to quit and then blazing as soon as I got off work.  Wake and repeat the next day until eventually my opinion of myself would get so low that I'd just stop trying to quit.  Until the next time.

So 6th April I posted here that it was Day 1.  I lasted two days, still pretty good for me.  Usually I would uninstall my sobriety tracker at this point and instantly go back to 7-10 joints a day.  But I decided OK, if you smoke, you reset that timer every damn time.  I had smoked for a social occasion, so I decided OK, you had fun at the social occasion but continuing to smoke five more joints on your own won't add anything to that pleasure.  I also tracked everything in my journal and made myself reflect upon my success or failure each morning.

Between then and the 19th April I had 6 more sober days and 7 days where I did smoke.  Instead of throwing in the towel, I committed to looking critically at those days where I had smoked and why I wanted to.  I found it was such a habit to smoke when I got home from work, that I had to delay going home from work for as long as possible.  I realised that I will almost always smoke in certain social situations, so I ducked out of those situations (that one was hard but I have since started seeing people from that group individually, which I find more manageable.)

On those 7 days I smoked an average of 2 joints instead of my usual 7-10.  I wasn't tapering intentionally, I was just sticking to my commitments of resetting that counter and not allowing a social smoke turn into an evening getting blitzed alone.

Resetting the counter really helped.  I was already experiencing withdrawals due to the dramatic reduction and it just came to a point where I'd sweat a gallon and had nightmares the night  before, and seeing that counter move back to 0 made me realise I was willfully prolonging that pain.

I managed to not smoke alone at night, after having a couple with friends, by just leaving my weed at their house.  I didn't even have to explain it, forgetful stoners do stuff like that all the time.

I haven't smoked since the 19th April, by the time today is over I'll have done a fortnight.  Easily the longest I've been without weed since my early twenties.  I believe the changes I made beforehand really helped make it different this time.  So I just wanted to post this for all the people out there who think they can't make it past day 1, make small changes and commit to them.  I am only 14 days in, so offer advice humbly and know I have a long way to go.  But if you're like me and struggle to make it past day 1, know that you absolutely can do it, you just have to find the right starting point!",10,0

I get bored of the internet more quickly. I used to roll a joint, and then spend then next like 8 hours watching streamers or YouTube, or arguing about politics on the internet. 

Lately, I get bored really quickly from all the sites I would be on all day while smoking. I used to watch like all of a 4 to 8 hour stream, but now I just wait for the streamer to upload clips to their YouTube channel. I used to search Reddit or YouTube for people with dumb opinions and get the thrill of crushing them with facts and logic. Now I just prefer to read or listen to a podcast on such topics so I can learn more about them. 

The internet is just boring to me now. 

I have Netflix, but yesterday, I looked at what is available on there for like 20 minutes before I was like ""eh, fuck this"" and then just studied. 

I've always been someone that liked learning, but now I think I can finally transition to the form of myself I've always romanticized that studies all day in the never-ending pursuit of knowledge.

I keep a journal to track my thoughts since I started quitting, and Despite a journal I’ve written filled with negative experiences every single time I’m high(literally almost 90% of every journal entry I have while high, I’m either depressed or having anxiety)  I still crave weed. It’s like I’m worried I won’t be able to fit in without this addiction. I feel like weed fulfills something, like when people see me high or see that I am smoking a joint, That it makes me a more artistic, interesting, deep person, this drug addiction of mine. I know that sounds lame to write out, but it’s the truth and I’m gonna speak my mind because we’re all just internet strangers anyways. Or, Maybe it’s my brain trying to justify just “one” more joint. 


Another worry I have, is that I’m gonna relapse anyways so why not let myself down early? Why wait until I make it to day 40, 50, even 60 just to have to restart again. I made it to day 31 and now I’m on day 1. What is stopping me from smoking “just one more time” tomorrow when the dispensaries open back up? Can anyone relate to these feelings?? And if so how tf did u over come them :) 

I’m gonna commit to doing an excercise program and meditating tomorrow morning (it’s midnight now). A lot of people really recommended that I start some new hobbies and take care of myself, so I will start an exercise routine and meditate, and add more from there. For now I’m going to sleep, and I’m grateful for all of you, because you guys understand like no one else in my life. We can do this boys!!

However, I can't lie and say that the desire to get high and let my worries fly away for the moment is not existent. However through the bumpy road of relapses and struggles, I know that the happiness is only temporary and superficial. I realized that drugs aren't really a source happiness and in fact makes me sadder as I push away my struggles. 

What I learned from all the rehabilitation facilities I went to is that nobody who relies on drugs is truly happy, and are using drugs to push away the thing that is hurting them. And pushing through this barrier was really hard but to be honest, it felt really good afterwards after I let my self be vulnerable to the people I trust and the people who love me. It felt really good to cry and break through barriers little by little  It felt really good to look at the progress I had made. It felt good to be able to eat food without being high, and it felt good to look at a flower and appreciate its beauty without being high.

Because in the early stages of sobriety, the phrase ""this would be better if I were high"" would echo through my head as I felt a void that the high would fill. It was so easy to get the same amount of dopamine as getting an A on test that you studied hard for by smoking a joint. But there's no free in this world. As easy as the happiness would come, the void and empty feeling would overcome me even stronger than ever making me wanna get high until only weed could satiate my desire for dopamine. 

So if I could give advise, filling that hole is the only way you can sober up. And people say to fill the hole by doing things you love, but we all know its not that easy. Everything fucking sucks when your not high. Doing things that you like comes naturally, as you cant force yourself to like something. They also say to taper down, but again we know its not that easy.

Tbh the only way I was able to go cold turkey was by having a strong emotional realization and a strong determination to get sober. I had to repeat a grade at my school that my parents had to pay 30k an year for me to go to. And the money didn't come that easily and another year would put a strain in my parents lives. However, they knew I loved this school and kept pushing me to not drop out and were supportive all through my rehab phase. And during rehab I was doing pretty well and I was 1 month sober, until I got in touch with a dealer at the rehab. I was secretly using again for 2 months, lying to my sponsor, friends, and family and it felt like shit but I was high so I didn't care. I sleep in a room with my dad, but one day I woke up from getting really high the night before with a dab pen in my hand, and my dad could had easily found out if I had woken up later. I realized that I was going back to the same person that caused so much pain to my loved ones, and the thought of my parents seeing me in this state made me realize that I don't want to be a shitty burden anymore, and that I wanted to become the person they believed in.

It was still hard cold turkey in, but the thought of seeing my mom and dad crying again kept me going, and I revealed to them 5 months later that I had relapes before, and though they were shocked, they were happy to see that I was clean now. 

I didnt think I'd write this much but im glad I did. I guess I kinda vented and if you read all this thabks for giving a shit.
If you're still working in sobering up, don't feel rushed to do so, your on this sub because you know that what your doing is harmful and realization is the biggest step in recovery.( One tip is to cut off all your dealers and friends who tempt you to use. Its really fucking helpful) And if your going strong with sobriety, keep pushing. You have your reasons to be sober so don't go against them.

There's no free in this world. If you want change, you have to change first

I have become anxious, depressed, lonely, and ashamed. 

For years, I have justified my relationship with weed because it helped me escape the pain of existence and it was the only thing that could put me to sleep. I figured without it I would be worse. 

Like many people, I didn’t really think you could be ‘addicted’ to weed. This notion only contributed to my reluctance to quit. When weed was legalized in my state, I further justified my habits by thinking, well hey, it’s legal so it can’t be that bad. 

The pandemic has forced me to face a lot of problems that I had been ignoring. Being home all the time, isolated and without the accountability of going into the office for work made things so much worse. I was smoking constantly just to cope with the weight of the world. Slowly, over the last year, it has become clear to me how unhappy I have become. You really do hit a point when you are sick and tired of being sick and tired.

This post is going to very long and rambling, so apologies in advance for that! But I feel it is needed me for me to say these things.

# Pre-Addiction Weed Usage

I moved from a country where Weed was banned, to a state where I am easily able to get high quality edibles. I used to enjoy Weed how it was supposed to be enjoyed, occasionally, with friends, only during special moments, so that you don't dilute the fun. When I had weed the first time, I realized how great music sounded, how awesome it was to play Rocket League all day and even a Subway Sandwich tasted like Ambrosia. I was surprised how funny I was and how social I was as well. 

I have dealt with social anxiety all my life and it such a good experience to finally be able to break free. But I thought it was the weed that promoted my social life, Oh boy! Was I fucking wrong. It was actually the fact that I had good friends to speak to and occasions where we were socially and responsibly having weed. But I instead put Weed on a pedestal and that is where I feel things went really downhill.

# The First Addiction and Quit Attempt

## Reason for my Addiction

1. During Late 2019 - Early 2020, most of my friends left the city to pursue their careers or had to go back to their country due to visa issues. This left me extremely lonely as they were basically my social anchor. So you could say that Social Anxiety and Loneliness was the catalyst.

2. As I kept putting Weed on a higher and higher pedestal, being smug about how ""functioning I still am with weed"", I kept having weed at a higher frequency. It went from once in three months, to once a week to thrice a week really fast!

3. Then in March 2020 COVID hit hard, I was blessed to have a well paid job where I could work from home but that made me depressed even further because the last bastion of my social life(work) was also gone.

4. After this, I basically was unhinged, I went on a 2-3 month streak where I used to consume 100-200mg edibles every day.

## Quitting, What Worked and What Went Wrong

1. Somehow one day I had the realization that what I was doing was fucked up, as it was affecting my performance at work, so I stopped cold turkey, without doing any research about withdrawal symptoms (big mistake)

2. The first few days were hell, and that was when I did the research online, as to why I was not able to sleep or eat well.

3. Thankfully, I was able to handle the withdrawal, but this only went on for a month. I didn't do anything special here, I just waited until things were okay, but suffered a lot in the initial days as a result. I was back to normal within two weeks. 

4. I got really complacent and got back into the habit again, thinking that I had a one up over Weed because I somehow conquered it. I thought I would be able to moderate it (this is a repeating theme).
 
5. I spiraled out of control AGAIN because COVID loneliness, stress about losing job and leaving the country at any time etc. But it is only my ego to blame for this one.

# The Second Addiction and Quit Attempt

## Reason for my Addiction

1. My ego completely took over me, I dismissed genuine concern from my close friends by saying ""Weed isn't as bad as alcohol etc"", ""Weed actually has medicinal properties check it out!"", which led to another spiral.

2. Again, I realized how badly I was performing at work and I was getting overweight, I was also getting a lot of constipation and dehydration. So I quit cold turkey again, this time I was better prepared.

3. This phase was around maybe 2-3 months long. 

## Quitting, What Worked and What Went Wrong

1. What really worked for me this time, as opposed to my previous attempt where I did not do anything, was that I made sure I ate something even if I didn't feel hungry, and I ate enough no matter how hard it was to swallow.

2. I still did not find a good solution for insomnia, but the withdrawals again reduced within two weeks.

3. ""but the withdrawals again reduced within two weeks"", this exact thought was the best food my Ego had ever gotten so far, which led to another spiral.

# The Third Addiction and my current attempt at quitting.

## Reason for my Addiction

1. At this time my ego was at an all time high. In a period of 4-5 months I ate 100-250mg edibles almost everyday. I spent 1000$ a month on weed! (I am so ashamed writing this).

2. I got even more lonely and depressed as COVID hit the country harder, casting doubts over my future and finances, this eventually led to a depressive episode, which was also the reason why it happened again.

3. I became a bitter and irritable person, so much so that I started escalating my voice at my coworkers and my parents (Absolutely horrible behavior by me, they didn't deserve it)
|
4. But I thought it was okay during the time, because my EGO always made me think in an ""us against them"" mentality and I never took anyone's advice as something that is in my best interest. I always thought they were patronizing me, so I had even more Weed out of spite.

## Quitting and what is working so far

1. My life was in the dumps but thankfully there was something in me that realized I was wrong. Honestly, I felt like I was living life on an autopilot mode, I was very apathetic and it felt like I was looking at myself in third person.

2. This time, I quit cold turkey after 2-3 months of addiction (100-250mg edibles everyday)

3. Currently I am on Day 7, I quit cold turkey since last Monday. But this time I am back to normal within just a week.

4. What helped a lot of **exercise, exercise and exercise!** Does not matter what you do, do as much as you can, and make yourself exhausted so that you are incentivized to eat more, which leads to better sleep.

5. I also had stuff like Ensure especially when food wasn't able to go in my mouth. I made sure if I don't have the food volume, at least I have nutrition up to par.

So far it is going well, hopefully I do not fall prey to my ego again. I learned a lot of things, especially the underlying causes of my addictions and the hidden enemies that I realized which were much bigger catalysts than I thought. 

# The Obvious Ones

1. The big one was **Social Anxiety and Loneliness**, it made me bored and sad and I looked to Weed for help.

2. Another big one was **Procrastination**, as I used to put off work a lot and when the time to deliver came in, I used to deal with the pressure unhealthily with weed.

# The Hidden and the Dangerous

## Guilt and Shame

In retrospect, I realized that I let my ego took over me in the first place because of the Shame and Guilt that I felt for being an addict. The shame and guilt then succumbed to my ego, and then my ego said that **""There is no escape from your past, you should feel ashamed, but hey at least you have Weed!""**

I feel the shame and guilt aspect of this is the biggest perpetrator, because that is what is really hard to let go and admit. **You start blaming yourself for being a weed addict and then it leads to a very vicious cycle!** Then you eventually label yourself as one and then you lose hope, so you think you might as well be one (self-fulfilling prophecy coming true at its finest!)

## Time Anxiety

With the guilt and shame of lost time came something called 'Time Anxiety'. I was anxious and overloaded by thoughts like **""Am I too late to change!?""**, **""Is it too late for me to be social?""**, **""Will I forever be lonely?""**, anything positive I thought about myself my ego would always reply **""Too bad, its too late, you are in your mid twenties! Your friends have better jobs already! No point in changing for the better!!!""**

## Ground Truths and Conclusions

1. Remember that everyone's journey towards their goals is different. You will have your ups and downs like I did, but that does not mean there is no hope. 

2. There is no point in comparing yourself to others, would you think comparing yourself to someone worse off than you is fair? On the other side, comparing yourself who is clearly going through a struggle to someone who has it all, is not fair on you either. Remember every person is unique, its good to learn from others but at the same time respect yourself for where you are right now in life, in spite of all the shit you went through!

3. Procrastination is an emotional regulation issue, and not a laziness issue. This was a very big lesson to me.

4. Guilt and shame is the worst withdrawal symptom of all time.

I am so tired of this. I don't want to be addicted like this anymore. Even at 31 days I was getting my ass kicked mentally. I just need some hope, or some guidance. What the fuck do you guys do now? How do you stay sober? I know that sounds like a silly question but for a guy who has tried it a million times and hasn't made it past 31 days, I just want to know if it ever truly gets better.

I had smoked for a year in high school but eventually got bored of it and just threw it away and didn't look back. That summer I picked it up again when I became really close friends with someone who happened to smoke weed. Needless to say, my last year and a half of college wasn't as successful. I remember when I started smoking with my pal that we struggled to find dealers sometimes, figuring out clever ways to smoke regardless of being ""dank-rupt"", not having access when we had the money or not having the money when we had access. Getting high in college was like a game. It wasn't until the summer before my last semester that we got reliable dealers and decent money flow. I graduated in December 2017.

In March of 2018 I started dating my current partner. Last year he got a job in a weed dispensary. He doesn't even really smoke. He'll take a 5 mg edible before bed, maybe take a hit off a cart, and never really smokes to get high. This means I get all the goodies- free weed, free pieces, free edibles, free prerolls. Everything. Free. All the time. I feel like Santa Clause the few times I've shown up for smoke sessions just giving out all this free stuff that I can't even get through. I'm currently in addiction therapy (more details on that journey in the comments) for diagnosed ""severe dependency"" of marijuana. My therapist and I determined a quit date (July 5) and have been working on tracking and reducing while discussing processes and helpful strategies to make sure when I quit, it's successful.

Looking back at my college days and they way it was such a struggle to smoke and where I am at now, I think I've had a mild epiphany. I think past Kennedy (that's my name) is living the dream- an adult job, free and unlimited THC products, and more time at home due to the pandemic. Like, I'm the version of myself that college stoner me couldn't even imagine. Maybe there is a false sense of guilt for betraying what feels like a win. It's possible that achieving this ability of getting free THC products (even though I put no effort towards this) really does feel like just that: an achievement. This doesn't mean I am going to not quit, it's just a wild feeling I wasn't expecting.",4,1

At night i would wake up after 3-4 hours consistently with panic attacks and i am just all so tired of this.

I went to the ER for stomache pain a month ago and they did a CAT scan and everything and they said i was a healthy guy.

Whats weird is that this time im quitting, ive had different withdrawal symptoms. Like for example, normally id have a diminished appetite but nowadays i can eat as much as i want even without weed.

My theory is that for some reason, my body stopped being able to process THC so im super sensitive to any thc leaking in my body which is causing this anxiety.

Still im 1 month in and im still suffering from physical symptoms of anxiety. My left shoulder or armpit would feel tight or sometimes id have small chest pain. Its even more apparent when i starve and eat as well. I would have headaches somedays as well 

Anyone else having this issue? Its killing me and im tired throughout the day from panic attacks at night and anxiety attacks during the day. Ive never experienced this before. In the past it would be just insomnia and sromache issues but this time its none of that.

I really didn't think MJ would be that hard to conquer. Its not supposed to be addictive right? 

I was two months into quitting cigarettes when I decided to drop MJ. What followed in the next three weeks almost crushed me. I had to lean on family to get through what I would describe as the worst experience and feelings I have ever had. It was like every negative emotion I was supposed to feel for over a decade came to the surface in those weeks. I've been forced to get on some meds for anxiety, which have slightly leveled me out. But I still have a hard time finding pleasure in anything right now. Yesterday I had an emotional breakdown, which left me in a puddle of tears.

I do appreciate feeling parts of sobriety I haven't felt in years. Waking up with a clear head is amazing. I generally have deeper sleeps than I have in many years. Dreaming is kinda wild ! 

I am working with an addictions counselor, and also attending a tonne of MA meetings, which are a saving grace. I also am starting working through the steps, been chatting with my sponsor. He's younger than me, and kinda quirky but has been through so unreal shit in life, and some heavy addictions. 

I am really fighting to not pick up cigs. I guess I think maybe it would be some type of crutch. My improved physical feelings (lungs, breathing, cough), I think is what keeps be from doing so.

I guess I needed to vent a little....hence this post.

Less laziness, more motivation, saving more money than ever. Then I started using some Delta 8 and telling myself “what’s the harm?” Basically delta 8 is a much more suddle form of delta 9. I compare it to smoking mid vs smoking loud. I felt fine on delta 8 and started using it everyday in April. After being buzzed everyday, 4/20 came around and I told myself “shit if I’ve been getting a little high, what’s wrong with getting really high?” So I went to visit my cousin and my old plug, picked up 2 different strains, a quarter of each. Now I’ve been smoking everyday since. 2 weeks straight, every chance I get. I guess this is my word of caution: delta 8, delta 10, etc. STILL get you high. I don’t care if it’s a little high or even hardly noticeable. It still trains your mine to be dependent on it if you’re like me.

It just doesn't serve me like it used to, it just makes me tired, paranoid, anxious, and even very stupid. I don't enjoy it anymore.

Some time ago I quit for a month, went though the tough withdrawals. It was fine but caved in New Years and been smoking most days since then.

It's not easy with most of my family and friends being stoners, and the fact that I live in Colorado. It's everywhere, and it's not like I have strong urges but being sober is basically taboo here and not many people respect the idea of getting clean and taking care of health. 

It sucks because it seems like the only way to bond with anyone anymore is smoking, drinking, and doing dumb shit that has no benefit. I rarely drink and I never want it to be a habit like weed is for me

I don't want to be a burn out like most people I know. I just feel alone in this situation. Getting high with people I'm close to but not feeling present in the moment, just stuck in my dumb head barely able to do simple shit cuz I'm too damn stoned.

I've tried quitting before and found myself back to the same bad habits. I downloaded an app that tracks how much you save and more importantly the amount of joints you don't smoke. It's a great way to gamify sobriety and help track the goal of staying grounded. I highly recommend finding something like that. 

There are so many reasons to quit. I listed lots here
[first post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8k86uy/why_i_am_quitting_why_you_should_too/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

But I have more sinister ones that you might be feeling that are worth mentioning. You lose self confidence. You're always thinking how other people perceive you. You become a bit more paranoid. And I don't know about you, but I started feeling a sense of dread and anxiety when I smoked. I was always high and I was always suffering from small waves of dread and anxiety and then back to pleasure. It's a terrible way to live your life. 

I think the hard part for me is, reaching a point where you forget the bad stuff, and remember only the good.

Just remember it's a drug. It comes up in RDTs with cops. It can ruin your life. You don't need it. You can have fun without it.

I went to a friend's house were we were gathering for a birthday. It was one of the groups I would usually smoke every time I met them and probably be one of the heaviest smokers among them. About half of the group are pot smokers and the other half never smoke. I used to bond almost entirely with the pot smokers of the course of the years.

Not long after arriving I was, of course, offered weed and for the first time in my life I said NO. I then spent most of the day with the non-smokers.

A few things I noticed after me refusing weed: 

* I was far more socially anxious than ""normally"". I used weed to get past my social anxiety and introvert nature and be able to be more talkative. This time, not smoking, I had to be in my natural ways, that is pretty clumsy in social settings.
* In spite of the theoretical ""power"" that I could feel for having a stronger will than usually, some thoughts about relapsing challenged me and I had to deal with them rather than celebrating (""it's just today"", ""it will make you more comfortable socially"", ""you're still not smoking daily"" and other similar bullshit) — thanks God, I didn't go too far with these thoughts. 
* I did not use anything to replace weed, like alcohol, and this made me perfectly sober in the setting, trying to have fun sober. For over years I would use some sort of enhancer to make myself more sociable and I want to fix that. I am tired of using these ""solutions"". But also means I have to face my social anxiety full force and for many months to come.
* I was really happy later in the evening when I realised I could just be half smoked and feeling like shit for relapsing, but I was able to prevent that and to continue past the 29th day, instead of going back to 0 and all the emotional toil that comes with that.

In conclusion: saying NO does not necessarily feel happy or powerful in the moment, it's a challenge and it can be painful, boring, awkward, socially anxious. The real reward is when at the end of the day you realise how close you were and how bravely you stood before weed and kept your commitments to yourself like a grown adult.

I had a pretty serious relapse, doing all the things I swore I’d never do again. Buying/stealing it, smoking alone, sneaking away from social situations to get more high. It was like all my progress had been erased and I was just right back to who I was doing the same dumb shit.

Amongst these was the anxiety and paranoia it gave me, dodging calls, ruined relationships, awkward moments, overeating, overspending.

Today it has been 40+ days since I last smoked, hard to believe that this is the longest I have gone without blazing in 7 years or so. Kind of a scary statistic to be honest.

I am not going to smoke today, but I feel like it's only a matter of time now.

I am not sure why I feel it's inevitable, maybe because the reasons never seem as pressing when you aren't actively in a terrible cycle of smoking and hating yourself.

You know the high will be better, you can fool yourself that ""this time I really will have self-control, I will smoke once and then go back to abstaining - THAT'S TRUE RESPONSIBILITY"" (obviously BS).

I am just tired, I feel like shit. I should be proud - I finished my first year of law school during the pandemic, lost 7 kilos in the past few months, but I am just lonely, bored and tired.

I have also replaced weed with another somewhat addictive herbal substance, maybe that's why I feel like I am failing anyway.

My neighbours are smoking weed right now and I actually got paranoid I could get high just by smelling it (lol), I got angry and almost wanted to complain about it (its legal here so they would only get in trouble for smoking in a non-smoking building, no legal repercussions), but that would be a dick move and hypocritical since I am sure they've smelled my smoke in the past.

Shit, this really is far from eloquent, I am not even sure what point I am trying to make. I just feel defeated and using this as my diary I guess.

Anyone else ever feel like they will fuck up anyway so might as well give in now and save the disappointment of ruining an even longer streak?

On the other hand, it is true that relapse isn't the end of the world and does not erase all progress. However, this can also be construed by the addict brain to simply say ""just relapse now, it won't erase your progress"".

Hating oneself and being paranoid/hypervigilant about potential relapse/scaring yourself into stay sober is ineffective. Too much kindness and empathy is too in my opinion. You just can't win eh?",10,1

I am still sober and all the changes have been mostly positive. I got a huge promotion at work and bought my own house! I really don’t think this would have been possible without my increased memory and work ethic from quitting weed. I really don’t think about weed much on the day to day and sometimes my mind still tells me that I could smoke only on the weekends. I still have an occasional dream where I smoke weed and feel really guilty for breaking the sober streak. Other than that I probably won’t go back to smoking weed. I had my sister and her boyfriend come visit me last summer and they asked if they could pull out my volcano and I said yes and that was my most tempting moment that year but other than that it gets much easier as time goes on. My biggest piece of advice is still download a sobriety tracker like iamsober.





#My post from one year ago:



Today I have been clean from marijuana for one year. I used to smoke daily for four years before I decided to quit. I hope with my introspection that I can inspire someone to take the journey on sobriety and show them that it actually is worth it.


#Before going sober

In the beginning I tried weed in high school and I HATED it. I was taking ADD medication at the time and it mixed very fucking badly and I had no idea what caused it. So after that I was the sober one of my friend group because I was scared to even try alcohol and alter my mind in any way. A couple years after that I had a girl break my heart pretty bad and I was still hanging out with guys who were smoking around me regularly so I said fuck it let me try it one more time. 

It was amazing. It had no bad effects and just made me feel warm and happy. (I had stopped taking that ADD medication) I couldn’t believe I had been missing out that entire time! In my mind I was like “Wow! I guess I am a weed smoker now!” I would go over to my homies house where his mom didn’t care about weed smoking and we would just smoke and chill. I finally had a vice to escape my problems and just feel good.

The three of us who smoked regularly knew that we all wanted something more. We could really only smoke weed at my friend’s mom’s house or on the road because my state was still very much illegal. The 1/8ths were also $60 lol. So us three decided to move 11 hours away to Colorado where I live currently.

We all moved in together and worked at the same job on the same shift. We would work from 2pm to 10:30pm and then all get on our computers from 11:00pm to 4am getting dumb high the entire time, wake up and pretty much just wait to go to work. There was no time for house chores, socializing, or much of anything. We just worked, smoked weed and played video games. In a lot of ways this was a really lonely time for me even though I was living with my two best friends.

We eventually started seeing each other as roommates and would get stressed from the mess in the living room and the kitchen. No one wanted to clean up after the other ones mess so we just kept to ourselves in our separate rooms. We all finally moved out and went on our separate ways.

I had a long term girlfriend and we moved in together. I was still very regularly smoking weed but I had upped it even more to my volcano and blunts. She doesn’t smoke weed but obviously knew I did and just loved me for who I was.

#Deciding to get sober

What ultimately made me decide to get sober is the negative effects that started to show themselves after years of smoking daily. I started to not really be funny anymore. Before I started smoking I was really funny and witty and I could feel it slipping away. I also started to say stupid shit whenever I was high that would make my girlfriend say “babe what the fuck are you talking about?” My memory was also shit and I couldn’t remember very simple things that I had to do and it would frustrate my girlfriend greatly. I would also have plans to clean up the kitchen but smoke weed before had to make the cleaning “more fun” and just sink into my computer chair or just fall asleep on the couch. I was also much more socially awkward and would stumble over my words pretty bad when talking to strangers giving me some cringe moments to think back on.

#Going sober

May 1st 2019 I decided to go sober. I wanted to progress in my job and felt like my shit memory was keeping me back. I was also going to be moving into a dope house with my girlfriend so I packed up every single weed thing and put it in my closet. That first two weeks was TORTURE. My mind was constantly telling me to get that box back out and fire up the volcano. My dreams were fucking crazy and sometimes violent. My mind was constantly telling me that I could use it in moderation and I could make a plan to just scale it back instead of quitting entirely. My motivation was through the floor and I was pretty much just couch locked. I was binging tv shows to get my mind of the pangs of addiction but it was constantly popping into my head. My girlfriend was supportive but was annoyed at how I wasn’t doing literally any chore and just coming home and watching tv on the couch. (I didn’t even go on the computer because that was where I smoked weed so the temptation was too much)

#The next year

It does get easier. It takes awhile for it to leave your system and for your functions to start coming back. My dreams started to get less intense and my addiction pangs started to become less frequent. My memory started to come back and so did my confidence in social situations. I started to be able to plan for the future and do things I didn’t want to do in the present day to help me in the future. I started to really appreciate a clean house and realize that cleaning is worth it and loading a fucking dishwasher isn’t the end of the world. 

#Today and advice for you

So I still had a dream about smoking a blunt literally last night. The feeling of how awesome weed is still hasn’t left me but its more like an old friend that I know is bad to hang around. My memory is on fucking point and I got my wit back and regularly make my coworkers laugh hard on a daily basis. I roast entire $3.99 chickens and eat brussel sprouts and rice everyday for break at work. I estimate I saved over $400 not smoking weed last year. And I’m saving a shit ton of money not eating fast food/ junk food all the time. My relationship is doing great and I do my fair share of chores regularly now and actually kind of enjoy doing them (don’t tell my girlfriend). It is 100% worth it and I’m not sure I will ever smoke again. My trajectory for my life is amazing right now and I really don’t want to fall back to my old habits. If you are still reading this the best advice I can give you is two things. 1 - get ALL your weed stuff out of your reach and out of temptation. Drop it off at a friends house, get rid of it or give it to someone. 2 - Download Iamsober app on your phone. The thought of resetting my progress counter stopped me countless, countless times. It was absolutely huge in me not starting again. I recommend taking this journey because I don’t regret a second of last year.",14,0

To anyone doubting things will get better it 110% will. I just started a nursing program and it’s really tough. We have assignments on top of assignments and tests on top of tests. I’ve aced both of my 1st exams in pathophysiology and some bs informatics class. There’s like 4-5 exams more left within the next month. I study like 10 hours a day broken up throughout the 4 days I don’t have school. Maybe 4-6 hours on days I have school. I literally thought my brain was broken but if it was how was I able to score high on the study of diseases test. There is still some sort of lingering brain fog 😶‍🌫️. But it feels like the more I push my brain to the limits academically the more it’s helping. That self doubt definitely makes you think you can’t achieve what you want. I just wanted to post this for others who think their brain is broken it’s not. We just have to put in a lot more effort to get the same results as others that’s all. I’m sure the more I train my brain the better things will get within the next year. I’ve tried to include lots of healthy brain foods in my diet also. May the force be with you.,17,0

This is my first post so apologies if I’m doing it wrong..(copied from another page as I’m trying to get as much spec as possible on how to quit)

I’ve been smoking weed heavily for about four years now (20-24). At the start it was so much fun and it linked in with nearly everything I did but as the time went on I found that my tolerance was getting higher and high was getting lower. 

Weed has always been a problem for me as I’m co dependent and cannabis really helps fill that empty void within but now it’s gotten to the point where I feel the weed is smoking me more than I’m smoking it. Lockdown has amplified my smoking habits and considering I smoke with tobacco (too expensive to just smoke blunts where I’m from) I feel the damage that I’m doing to my body is not worth.

I quit for two months at the start of the year but then relapsed and since then I’ve been the worst I’ve ever been both mentally and physically…

I quit again on Monday and I’m really hoping to stick it this time. 

Ending my ramble I just wanted to know if there’s anyone out there that has some advice/reassurance for a lonely stoner?

I really want to turn it around but f*ck me it’s so  hard.",4,1

This time I haven’t even looked back. The first 2 weeks of quitting wasn’t so bad because I was working 12hr days, 6 to 7 days a week so I just didn’t have time and was exhausted after work anyways.

I was last active on this sub in the fall (couple posts). I am a 22 year old senior in college who smoked weed daily since age 17. I quit on September 28th, 2020 and made it nearly 3 months to December 20th, 2020 when I relapsed after my last exam of the semester. 

And I relapsed pretty hard. At first I was deeply ashamed of myself for breaking my streak, but then I quickly gave in and started smoking more than I ever have before. Fast forward to today, May 1st, 2021, and I have smoked every single day since New Years. And lately, It’s been upwards of 2 gs a day.

My tolerance is through the roof again, and I pushed off a lot of the things I was planning to do with my time this spring. I feel like I failed again, and I feel like an addict who can’t be a normal person who just smokes casually. It is by far my least favorite thing about myself because in reality I am quite proud of who I am and what I have achieved in my life: I support my single mother financially, helped pay my way through college, and got my dream job lined up after graduation. 

My big downfall is weed. It makes me incredibly lazy and drops my standard of quality for everything. Simply put, I just don’t give enough of a fuck about things when I’m baked all day. I have been able to navigate school and work by going through phases of being sober for a week or two, sandwiched between months of weed abuse/being unproductive. What is so scary to me is that I feel like I can’t kick this habit even though I know it’s not a sustainable lifestyle, and I am now getting ready to enter the ""real world"".

But honestly, this relapse has helped me finally conclude that I really, really can’t smoke weed in moderation. I have to give it up 100% to be truly successful and happy. No matter how hard it may be, how much I may miss it, it needs to be done for the sake of my family and for the sake of my future in general. And since I was 18 I’ve promised myself I would give it up for good in college; well, with 3 weeks to go before graduation the clock is at the 11th hour and I don’t plan on breaking my own promise.

So today marks Day 1, again. I’m hoping to make it last this time, but the key is to just take it day by day. Wish me luck, and I’ll be rooting for y’all too! If you have made it this far, thank you. I mostly just write these to put my own thoughts into words but if it helps even one other person out that’s even better :).

Cheers,
E",18,0

I have been a lurker here since 2016 and I feel infinite gratitude to each and every one of you. Although it took me years to actually quit for good, just lurking kept the goal in front of my eyes. This is very important, if you still consume THC and lurk here, please don't leave thinking you failed, just staying here means you are on the right track.

Today marks my 202nd day in sobriety, I felt I owe this community a lot and wanted to share with you.

I don't know how to say it, but since the day I quit, I have been gaining more and more of the self confidence and satisfaction. Although you may feel these are intangible benefits, I feel like this is actually the best thing that happened as a result of quitting.

If you want tangible benefits, here goes:
- Quit Nicotine for good
- Lost 10 kg, now 10 kg closer to my target
- Way less fights with my wife
- Much better relationship with my son
- Pretty much restarted my wife's career as a freelancer after a very long stagnation period
- Finished 6+ courses and got an internship at a well-known multinational company

All this looks pretty miniscule when compared to the feeling of fullness and satisfaction I get when I actually stop and think how I am an independent free person.

I felt like this joy is too much for me, I want everyone reading this to get a chance to feel the same. Just take the step, you will thank yourself later.

So when I stop. I stop drinking too (since I know it will make it impossible to stay off weed), and I go to aa meetings so I can work the steps and access the spiritual program.

Last week or at the beginning of this week my best friend and me have came to a realisation that we are really addicted to weed. We always had those talkes about quitting or maybe even toning down but never went with it. My problem is that I haven't been sober since I was 17  (me being 21 now). A lot of times I tried to justify my addiction like no I am not addicted or no I can go without weed no problem. Maybe I can but I am just to lazy to do or to even star doing it. I tried to do it a number of times but I would always end up relapsing. I don't know if I have the strength to stop forever but I want to try it. The second problem are my other friends.  I don't have a lot of them, but the ones I hung out all smoke weed. I noticed that with all of them and even my best friend I became very close after smoking. So I think it will be tricky to be in that situation with them without taking a hit or what not. I don't no what to say anymore and I am sorry if this post is all over the place. 
This is my 5th day without smoking and I hope I continue down this path (to see how's life being sober and to stop avoiding my responsibilities and running away from my problems).

I found it when someone said my description of my weed use sounded like abuse. They linked me to this sub. I've never thought the same about how I smoke weed. 

I thought that weed addiction was like being addicted to cake: NBD. I could stop when I wanted. Truth is, I have a fucking hard time with cake too! 

I've taught my brain that I'm only happy when I'm high. So when I'm not high, I'm not happy. That might not look like other kinds of addiction, but it's permeated every aspect of my life as an adult.

I was defensive after first reading the initial comment calling out my usage. But I've never been a totally sober adult because I didn't consider being high *not sober.* 

I come to the end of this chapter of my life with a fond but emphatic farewell; I'll miss weed like an old friend, but like some old friends I've outgrown my weed habit. I've accomplished so much, despite fucking up so bad early in my young adult life that I wonder how much more could have been... But I don't think regrets are useful, and I'll never be mad at weed for my problems with weed. It's great. I just can't anymore, it's holding me back.

Earlier this week I came the realization that I was ready, inspired by a post on this sub by some who described similar usage and opinion on weed as my own. A first. I left a comment that was a bit rambling, and mostly about myself (not OP). But it was the first moment I felt I could actually do it, and not because someone else wanted me to but because ***I actually wanted to quit.***

It was that comment that a troll decided was what they wanted to use to hurt me in a heated argument about the decency of sharing the hilarious koala-hate copypasta in a comment thread about a woman saving a koala (a damn hero). 

But in my response was genuine steadfast resolve. I actually believe this shit now! Here's what I wrote:

> I appreciate the encouragement, more than you know.

> But this isn't the way to get my attention buddy. 

> This functioning pothead has been a keynote speaker at tech conferences, makes a six figure salary, has a kid start college, and just got approved for his first mortgage. All that after coming up mostly on government assistance for the first half of our kids' lives. 

> And I ran out of weed on Monday. Just finished my last cart. Got a bit of shatter left and then it's all gone. Have to take a trip to take care of an elderly family member, so the perfect time to go cold turkey. I'm actually looking forward to being sober for the first time in my life.

It was the final piece for me: I'm ready... My response to them has reinforced my belief this time I'm finally quitting. I didn't have to tell a stranger about that, but it was the first time I can remember not feeling genuinely defensive about my weed use. Because there's no turning back. And I ***want*** to do it now. Leggo",97,0
